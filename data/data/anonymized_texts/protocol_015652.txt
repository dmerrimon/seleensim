 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  30 
 31 
According to the  latest  estimates  published by the International Diabetes Federation, 415 32 
million adults were living with diabetes in 2015 and this number is expected to rise to 33 
642 million (or 1 adult in 10) by 2040 (1).  This makes it likely that a good proportion of 34 
the 8 million people who board an aircraft each day ( www.iata.org ) are flying with an 35 
established diagnosis of diabetes. In the United States and based on diabetes prevalence 36 
data, approximately 17 million leisure and 5.6 million business travelers travel with 37 
diabetes and at least a quarter will be using insulin on a daily basis (2).  38 
 39 
For insulin treated individuals planning long- haul travel  (defined as a flight lastin g more 40 
than 6hours) , consideration needs to be given to every stage of a journey from deciding 41 
what to pack, choosing appropriate travel insurance, dealing with airport security, 42 
anticipating consequences of late or delayed flights, preparing for the poten tial impact of 43 
flying in a pressurized cabin on the performance of medical devices and choosing a meal 44 
on board through to assessing the impact of crossing multiple times zones and jet lag on 45 
insulin action and the perception of low blood glucose levels at  altitude ( 3). O nce a 46 
traveler with diabetes arrives at their destination , it is advisable to plan in the event their 47 
diabetes supplies are lost or stolen , as well as dealing with unfamiliar foods, 48 
unaccustomed exercise, or even riding roller coasters ( 4). In one survey more than half of 49 
travelers with diabetes reported difficulties in glucose management during their journey 50 
compared to the month prior to leaving ( 5). In general, for insulin- treated individuals 51 
around 10% of travelers on short as well as long- haul journeys experienced problems, 52 
most commonly hypoglycemia during the journey or in the first 24 hours after arriving at 53 
their destination ( 6). For long- haul travel in particular, there is evidence that most 54 
physicians, including diabetes specialist s, are uncertain about how to adjust insulin doses 55 
for patients who travel across several time zones and some of the information provided is 56 
described as “potentially harmful” ( 7). Furthermore , recent testimony from on- line 57 
bloggers and patient forums continues to highlight specific problems related to diabetes 58 
and travel ( 8). 59 
 60 
We sought to determine the real -life experiences of individuals traveling long distance 61 
(across five or more  time-zones ) with type 1 diabetes (T1D). M embers of the T1D 62 
Exchange  (n=503)  online community (www.myglu.org) completed a 45- question survey 63 
about their travel experiences flying long distance  (9). The cohort was stratified by 64 
duration of T1D and whether or not parti cipants used continuous subcutaneous insulin 65 
infusion (CSII) therapy  and/or a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). In the last 5 years, 66 
71% of participants  had flown long distance. When asked about their perceived ‘‘fear of 67 
flying,’’ CSII users (with and without a CGM) reported their primary anxiety was 68 
‘‘losing supplies,’’ while non- CSII users described concerns over ‘‘unstable blood 69 
glucose (highs and lows)’’ (P < 0.05). In addition, 74% of participants reported more 70 
hypoglycemia  and/or hyperglycemia while t raveling overseas and 9% had avoided 71 
international travel altogether  because of problems related to diabetes management. 72 
Furthermore, 22% of participants had run out of  insulin at some point during a trip and 73 
37% reported inadequate attention in current sources of information to the 74 
unpredictability of self -management needs while traveling. Especially problematic for 75 
Version 2.0, January 18, 2019   3 
 individuals traveling with T1D are a lack of resources adequately addressing : (a) 76 
protocols for emergencies while abroad, ( b) how to navigate airport security, and ( c) 77 
managing basal insulin rates when crossing time zones. A strong need exists for easily 78 
accessible, free resources for traveli ng with T1D that is tailored to both device use and 79 
duration of the disease   80 
 81 
Currently, there is a lack of patient -centered research evaluating the practical and 82 
psychosocial aspects of travel and T1D. F ew resources offer practical and easy to 83 
understand travel guidance to individuals with T1D. Available sources of information 84 
include publications targeting physicians and scientific researchers, online articles 85 
providing generalized tips (transportation and storage of supplies, suggested 86 
immunizations, diet regimens to follow, optimizing insulin dose modification across time 87 
zones) and free electronic dosage calculators (10-14). For the most part these articles are 88 
well written and offer sound counsel, but many guidelines are overly complicated with 89 
medical jargon and complex tables describing insulin dosing adjustments . This pos es a 90 
problem for both patients and providers looking for simple travel advice ( 15). Diabetes 91 
also contributes to medical emergencies that affect 1 in every 614 flights (16). 92 
 93 
On August 6th 2015 we launched www.DiabetesTravel.org , a free on -line resource 94 
focusing exclusively on long- haul travel and diabetes. As well as providing information, 95 
we have also offered a “travel calculator” to provide guidance on planning changes in the 96 
timing and frequency of insulin therapy to aid discussions with diabetes teams caring for 97 
individuals with T1D. Since launch almost 25,000 users have logged on with 52% 98 
coming from the US (source Google Analytics, accessed 12/15/2017). We have also 99 
received multiple , favorable comments on social media , and this has been achieved 100 
without marketing the site or the use of search engine optimization techniques.  101

 103 
RATIONALE  FOR THE STUDY 104 
 105 
The purpose of the proposed study is to compare insulin Degludec U100 with insulin 106 
Glargine U100 to determine the basal insulin of choice for adults with type 1 diabetes 107 
who fly non- stop across multiple time zones . With the introduction of Degludec as basal 108 
insulin for T1D and the opportunity to vary time of injection between 8 and 40 hours, the 109 
use of Degludec as a basal insulin may make it easier for both people living with T1D 110 
and diabetologists to plan long- haul travel compared to the us e of existing basal insulins 111 
when crossing multiple time zones  (insulin degludec injection) ( Label – FDA  112 
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2016/203314s003lbl.pdf .  113 
Accessed March 6, 2018.)  114

 116 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES  117 
 118 
To compare glycemic control end points between Deglude c U100 versus Glargine U100 119 
as the basal i nsulin in a pilot study of adults with type 1 diabetes who are established on 120 
multiple daily injections  (MDI)  of insulin and flying long- haul.   121 
Version 2.0, January 18, 2019   4 
 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  122 
Study Hypothesis : Once daily Degludec U100 as the basal insulin will provide better 123 
glycemic  control for people with type 1 diabetes on multiple daily injections  who are 124 
traveling non- stop across multiple time zones  than once daily Glargine U100.   125 
 126 
Endpoints : 127 
The P rimary endpoint  will be , using continuous interstitial glucose monitoring (CGM), 128 
achieved glycemic control defined as time in range ( 70-140 mg/dl ) during the initial 24 129 
hours  local time  (starting within 2 hours after arrivin g) in Newark, NJ  or JFK, NY after 130 
flying 9-10 hours West to East (from Honolulu, HI ) and after the return journey from 131 
New ark to Honolulu (flying East to West) comparing Glargine U100 versus 132 
DegludecU100 as the basal insulin.   133 
 134 
Participants will begin in Honolulu, HI (HNL) , fly to Newark (EWR ) or New York (JFK) 135 
where they will stay for up to 72 hours followed by a return long-haul flight back to 136 
Honolulu with up to 72 hours at this destination . This journey will be repeated after a 2 137 
week period when subjects return to their original insulin tre atment regimen  and then 138 
switch to the alternative basal insulin. When traveling east, the day gets shorter, so the 139 
basal insulin dose given during travel needs to be adjusted (see below). 140 
 141 Figure 1. Overview of protocol with Primary and Secondary en dpoint timelines for 142 
assessment. This journey will be undertaken twice - once using Glargine U100 and 143 
once using Degludec as  the basal insulin.  144 
 145 
 146 
 147 Secondary CGM End -Points  comparing Glargine U100 and Degludec as the basal 148 
insulin are based on recent consensus related to reporting of trials for artificial pancreas 149 
development (17): 150 
• Time in range (70-180 mg/dl) within the first 24 hours after arriving in HNL and 151 
EWR  or JFK  (starting within 2 hours after arrival). 152 
• For the inflight period of time and for the 72 hours in each destination: 153 
o Mean  +SD CGM glucose (mg/dl)   154 

Version 2.0, January 18, 2019   5 
 o % CGM time <50 mg/dl 155 
o % CGM time <60 mg/dl 156 
o % CGM time <70 mg/dl 157 
o % CGM time 70 –180 mg/dl  158 
o % CGM time >180 mg/dl  159 
o % CGM time >250 mg/dl  160 
o % CGM time >300 mg/ dl 161 
o SD and coefficient of variation of CGM values  162 
• Fasting BG at 0600 local time, using CGM  163 
• Additionally, new CGM BG ranges will be included as consensus guidelines 164 
emerge, including but not limited to those from the 2019 A dvanced T echnologies 165 
and T reatment s for D iabetes  International Consensus on Time in Range (29):  166 
o % CGM time 54 –69 mg/dl  167 
o % CGM time <54 mg/dl  168 
 169 
Secondary non -CGM derived endpoints  will be (a) Fear of hypoglycemia (HFS II) ( 18) 170 
and Hypoglycemic Confidence Scale  (28) , (b) Liverpool Jet -Lag Questionnaire  (19), (c) 171 
Salivary  cortisol and melatonin and ( d) Sleep duration and quality and ( e) Activity  172 
(ActiGraph , LLC , Florida)   (20). 173 
 174 
 175 
STUDY DESIGN  176 
 177 
This study will be a n open- label, single center, pilot study randomized to either  Glargine 178 
or Degludec as the basal insulin , and then a 2 week break, followed by a cross -over to the 179 
other insulin. The study will begin in  Honolulu (airport code H NL) with each non- stop 180 
flight to Newark, NJ (EWR)  or New York (JFK)  lasting approximately 10 hours with a 181 
5/6 hour time difference between destinations.  After up to 72 hour s in EWR  or JFK , they 182 
will return to Honolulu and spend up to 72 hours at that destination.  183 
 184 
Subjects will continue to use their regular meal- time fast -acting insulin. Based on our 185 
experience with open and closed loop studies in T1D, subjects will have basal insulin 186 
optimized using CGM profiles for up to 4 weeks prior to travel  (21) . One month of CGM 187 
use for CGM naïve subjects is also a valid time for familiarity with this glucose 188 
monitoring system.  189 
 190 
This is a single center pilot study based in the United States for which we are planning to 191 
recruit adults with establish ed T1D  currently being treated with multiple daily injections 192 
of insulin (MDI). Subjects for this trial will consist of individuals based on inclusion and 193 
exclusion criteria (see below) . The subjects must be willing  to pa rticipate in the clinical 194 
trial as per protocol and randomized to the use of Glargine or Degludec as their  basal 195 
insulin  with a 2 week break period between insulins and flights.  196 
 197 
Potential subject s will be sel ected  from the av ailable subject database a t the Sansum 198 
Diabetes Research Institute (SDRI) . Every effort will be ma de to establish e ligibility  of 199 
Version 2.0, January 18, 2019   6 
 the p articipants prior to enrollment. Only participants who me et all eligibility cr iteria will 200 
be enro lled i n the study. 201 
 202 
We anticipate to screen up to 40 in order to obtain at least 2 2 evaluable subjects  (see 203 
below) . If an enrolled subject must withdraw or fails to complete the study, the subject will 204 
be replaced to ensure at least 25 evaluable subjects. Subjects w ho ha ve been di agnosed  205 
with T1D  for at  least 1 year and are under c urrent treatment with any basal insulin 206 
analogue will be co nsidered for the trial. However, to minimize bias we plan to balance 207 
the number of subjects using either Degludec  or Glargine  at enrollment . Subject 208 
eligibility  will be co nfirmed  by study staff dur ing a screening visit. Blood dra ws will be 209 
collected as  required to demonstrate study eligibility  as noted be low.  210

 294 
Screening Visit : Subjects that meet the eligibility criteria and have signed the informed 295 
consent will continue to the screening visit which w ill be performed at SDRI  296 
(www.sansum.org ). The following screenin g ass essme nts will be co mpleted at baseline 297 
(pre-randomization):  298 
 299 
• Signed and dated informed consent 300

 317 
Subject randomization - Visit #1 . Subj ects who meet al l eligibility  criteria, have sign ed 318 
the infor med consent and comp leted all screenin g ass essme nts will continue to 319 
randomization. Screening and Visit #1 may occur on the same day. A su bject w ill be 320 

Version 2.0, January 18, 2019   10 
 considered en rolled i n the study after signing the informed consent.. After the  study team 321 
confirms enrollment, the su bject will be assigned a unique subject identification number 322 
which will be used to identify the subject throughout the study and will be used for all 323 
source documents. ,  At this visit travel plans will be also discussed and booked including 324 
ground transportation, flights, hotels and meals.  325 
 326 
If for any reason a subject is determined to no longer be eligible for the study after 327 
enrollment  but prior to the start of the travel phase of the study, the subject will be 328 
considered ineligible to continue and will be exited from the study. N o additional study 329 
assessments will be required to be completed. The reason for study exit will be clearly 330 
documented on the corresponding (eCRF ). If an enrolled subject must withdraw or fails 331 
to complete the study, the subject will be replaced to ensure at least 25 ev aluable 332 
subjects.  333 
 334 
Randomization -  Visit #1.  In Visit 1, s ubjects will be randomized to either starting 335 
Degludec or Glargine insulin and begin using this insulin according to the label insert  and 336 
full prescribing information 337 
(https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/203314lbl.pdf  and 338 
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/021081s034lbl.pdf ). For the 339 
purpose of basal insulin optimization we will use CGM data. Subjects who do not 340 
currently use CGM  will be fitted with a blinded CGM sys tem, the  Abbott FreeStyle Libre 341 
Pro (Abbott  Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) .  Subjects who are current CGM users may 342 
continue to use their personal CGM systems for the duration of the study. When 343 
necessary, c linical study staff will train subj ects on inserting and using the  study CGM 344 
device s.  The investigator will use clini cal judgment  to confirm that subjects are su itably 345 
trained on the safe use of CGM s. Subjects will also be gi ven a s tudy glucometer and 346 
strips.  Study staff will ensure  that the study meters and strips pass qua lity control testing 347 
and the su bject is adequately trained on the use  of the stu dy met ers as per the 348 
manufactur er’s instructions.  349 
 350 
Visits f or Basal Optimization – Visit s #2 and #3. O nce the randomization pha se has 351 
been initiated, the subject will be sent  hom e and CGM  data co llection w ill be o ngoing for 352 
the purpose of basal and meal -time insulin optimization . Over the next (up to 4) weeks 353 
clinical staff  will review the dose of basal insulin and make necess ary adjustments based 354 
on the CGM  values  at least once a week . Subjects will perform up to 4 fingerstick (FS) 355 
blood glucose (BG) measurements with the study meter. T he investigator will use clini cal 356 
judgment to adjust the basal  rate, insulin t o carbohy drate rati o, and correction factor to 357 
ensure subject safety prior to continuing the study. The next visits for basal optimization 358 
visits may  be co nducted  remote ly via telephone  at the subject’s preference and 359 
investigator’s d iscreti on. If any visits are planned to be conducted via telephone, the 360 
subject will need to be able to upload their CGM  data for the investigator to review 361 
remotely . At each visit  the investigator will re-assess glycemic co ntrol. If the investigator 362 
determines that it is unsafe for the  subject to co ntinue i nto the travel  phase o f the stu dy, 363 
the su bject will not be all owed to continue in  the study, a nd the  reason for study exit will 364 
be documented  on the  correspondin g source document .  365 
 366 
Version 2.0, January 18, 2019   11 
 Travel to Newark  (EWR) or New York (JFK)  from Honolulu (HNL)  (Visit #4 ), up 367 
to 72 hours in Newark  or New York  (Visit #5 ), return flight from EWR  (or JFK)  to 368 
HNL (visit #6) and 48 hours in Honolulu (visit #7) . Subjects originating in Santa 369 
Barbara will travel to Honolulu and spend up to 2 days adjusting. At this point subject s 370 
will begin t heir trip to the New York area. Subjects will base their travel plans at this 371 
stage according to routine advice from their cl inicians and from  372 
www.diabete stravel. org .  During travel U100 Glargine and Degludec  and rapid acting 373 
insulin  will be maintained in cool storage (36°F – 46°F [2°C – 8°C]) until first use using 374 
a proprietary travel storage pack (e.g. Frio Cool ing Pack). Once open for use insulins can 375 
be used for up to 28 days. During this time they can be safely kept at room temperature 376 
up to 86°F (30°C). The sponsor -investigator will ensure the availability of proper storage 377 
conditions. D uring each flight, blood glucose meters and strips and continuous glucose 378 
monitoring devices will be taken in hand luggage . All doses of insulin (basal and rapid 379 
acting) and time of insulin injections will be recorded  in the subject’s travel diary as well 380 
as sleep and meals . Subjects will perform at least  8 FS BGs during the flight. Subjects 381 
who regularly use CGMs may continue their personal CGM systems. 382 
 383 
For each flight the relevant basal insulin will be adjusted as described below . The 384

BASAL INSULIN ADJUSTMENTS FOR TRAVEL  410 
 411 
Version 2.0, January 18, 2019   12 
 For subjects taking long acting basal insulin by injection, travel requires a 4% adjustment 412 
to the insulin dose for each time zone traversed (1  hour is 4% of the 24 hour  day) (24 ). To 413 
avoid any confounding from the direction of t ravel,  both journeys will be identical for 414 
each basal insulin , i.e. beginning in Honolulu. With Degludec as the basal insulin, 415 
subjects will ta ke this the next day after arriving at their destination taking into 416 
consideration the change in time at the destination. As shown in clinical trials in T1 and 417 
T2 diabetes, Degludec allows for flexibility in the timing of dose administration provided 418 
a min imum of 8 h and maximum of 40 hours between injections is ensured 419 
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23393185 ). 420 
 421 
With Glargine as the basal insulin, subjects will adjust their basal insulin based on 422 
discussion with their specialist diabetes team and with information provided at 423 
www.DiabetesTravel.org .  424 
 425 
Westward travel from Newark (EWR )/or New York (JFK)  to Honolulu (HNL)  426 
 427 
This example uses a current dose of Glargine 20 units at 8 PM. The flight departs at 428 
10 AM Eastern Standard Time (EST) and arrives at 3 PM the same day local (Honolulu 429 
time - HST). Total travel time is 11 hours. 430 
 431 
Using the Westward Travel Algorithm ( Appendix 1), information on the starting time at 432 
departure is recorded along with the last time Glargine should be given -  20 units at 433 
8 PM the prior evening. As a rule, if Glargine is due during a flight, only half the usual 434 
dose (10 units) should be taken.  435 
 436 
The subject’s watch/clock should still be on departure time (EST) and the half of the 437 
normal dose (10 units) is given at 8 PM EST.  Immediately after this, the watch/clock 438 
should be reset to the destination time. Upon landing in Honolulu, the day is now ‘longer’ 439 
despite 11 hours having passed, as it is 3 PM HST. Since only half the basal insulin was 440 
given earlier in the day, the subject should give the remaining 50% dose (10 units) at 441 
8 PM HST after landing  in Hawaii. The next night, the normal insulin dose (20 units) is 442 
given at 8PM HST at the new location. By giving half the dose at 2 different times, the 443 
Glargine dose is extended out to cover the longer day to prevent hypoglycemia. Use of a 444 
time zone map ( http://www.worldtimezone.com/wtz -pacific24.php ) can help to determine 445 
how many time zones are traversed.  446 
 447 
Eastward travel from Honolulu (HNL) to Newark (EWR) /or New York (JFK)  448 
 449 
This example us es a current dose of Glargine 20 units at 8 PM. The flight departs at 3 450 
PM HST from Honolulu and arrives at 7 AM EST in Newark the next day. Total travel 451 
time is 10  hours. When traveling east, the day gets shorter, so the basal insulin dose given 452 
during tr avel can be adjusted one time using the formula (25) (Appendix 2 ): 453 
 454 

Version 2.0, January 18, 2019   13 
 For this journey only a single dosage reduction is needed. After the reduced travel dose is 455 
given, the subject should resume their normal dosing. For other journeys the number of 456 
time zones to be crossed can be found at http://www.timeanddate.com/time/map/ .  457 
 458 
Here the normal dose (20 units) of Glargine is given at 8 PM local time the evening 459 
before departure. During the flight at 8 PM HST, 13 units of Glargine are given per the 460 
formula.  After this dose is  given, the subject needs to change his/her watch to EST. The 461 
next full dose of Glargine is due 8 PM EST after arrival, which turns out to be 18 hours 462 
after the last dose. This reduced time between doses is why less Glargine is given on the 463 
flight.  464 
 465 
During each flight subjects will be provided with prepared food containing 15g snacks to 466 
be eaten every 3 hours until the appropriate time for a main meal at the destination. These 467 
snacks and all meals at each destination will be logged. Larger meals will be cov ered 468 
using the subject’s usual insulin: carbohydrate ratio and correction factor relevant to the 469 
carbohydrate content of the meal. If the subject’s  glucose falls outs ide of the required 470 
ranges during this time period, the  CGM sensor will alert and pr ompt the su bject to 471 
perform a confirmatory finger stick. If the BG  value is confirmed to be  outside of the 472 
accepta ble range, the su bject will self -treat according to usual practice, printed 473 
information and with the help of study staff traveling with them.   474 
 475 
 476 
Assessments for Safety : As both Degludec and Glargine are approved for use for type 1 477 
diabetes in the United States no additional safety requirements are required beyond usual 478 
clinical care. All subjects will be provided with oral glucose for the prevention of 479 
hypoglycaemia. In addition, subjects may have an exp erienced staff person with them  480 
during travel and will be in contact with SDRI physicians for any advice or problems that 481 
may arise.  482 
 483 
 484 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  485 
 486 
Sample Size Calculation and statistical analyses  487 
The study will have an open label, randomised cross -over design. Randomisation will be 488 
for basal insulin alone . This is a pilot study as no previous studies have been performed 489 
comparing basal insulins during long- haul travel. Given the novelty and practical 490 
relevance of the study and our recent information about the challenges face by 491 
individuals with T1D undertaking travel (see above) we believe that this project will have 492 
a very high chance of publication in a high im pact peer -reviewed journal.  493 
 494 
The aim is to compare the impact of long -haul travel on glycemic control (CGM derived 495 
data for time in range ( 70-140 mg/dl ) as the primary end point with the assessment 496 
during the initial 24 hours  after arriving at EWR  or JFK  and HNL  (starting within 2 497 
hours after arrival ) comparing Glargine U100 versus Degludec U100 as the basal 498 
insulin.  499 
 500 
Version 2.0, January 18, 2019   14 
 Primary Endpoint : time in 70 to 140 mg/dl  after a long- haul flight  from HNL to EWR  501 
or JFK and from EWR  or JFK  to HNL  during the initial 24 hours  after arriving at EWR  502 
or JFK  and HNL (starting  within 2 hours after arrival ). 503 
 504 
Secondary CGM End -Points  comparing Glargine and Degludec as the basal insulin):  505 
• Time in range (70 -180 mg/dl) within the first 24 hours  after arriving in HNL and 506 
EWR or JFK (starting within 2 hours after arrival). 507 
• Mean + SD CGM glucose  (mg/dl)   508 
• % CGM time <50 mg/dl 509 
• % CGM time <60 mg/dl 510 
• % CGM time <70 mg/dl 511 
• % CGM time 70 –180 mg/dl  512 
• % CGM time >180 mg/dl  513 
• % CGM time >250 mg/dl  514 
• % CGM time >300 mg/dl  515 
• SD and coefficient of variation of CGM values  516 
• Fasting BG at 0600 local time, using CGM  517 
• Additionally, new CGM BG ranges will be included as consensus guidelines 518 
emerge, including but not limited to those from the 2019 Advanced Technologies 519 
and Treatm ents for Diabetes International Consensus on Time in Range (29):  520 
o % CGM time 54 –69 mg/dl  521 
o % CGM time <54 mg/dl  522 
 523 
Comparisons will be made for  524 
• Total travel  525 
• Total East to West travel and West to East travel  526 
• 24 hours prior to each flight  527 
• During each flight (total time, from take -off to meal and from meal to landing)  528 
• 24, 48 and 72 hours at the destination 529 
 530 
In addition the secondary end–points will be compared for Glargine  and Degludec for 531 
specific time blocks to assess the contribution from each basal insulin:  532 
A. Between 2200 and 0700 hours the night before each flight  533 
B. Between 2200 and 0700 hours for Days  2 and 3 at each destination  534 
For the purpose of our primary outcome data CGM data will primarily be obtained from 535 
the Abbott FreeStyle Libre Pro system, but in the case of missing data, we will also 536 
evaluate any secondary personal CGM data.  537 
 538 
Sample size for this pilot study is based on recent data indicating that individuals with 539 
type 1 diabetes spend approximately 669+ 208 minutes between 70 -180 mg/dl (26). With 540 
the criterion for significance set at 0.05, and using a paired t -test analysis, a sample size 541 
of 22 subjects will achieve a power of at least 80% to detect a difference of 10% between 542 
basal insulins assuming the standard deviation of the difference is < 106 minutes (Table 543 
1). Although Battelino et al (26) reported the standard deviation of the targ et 544 
measurement, it did not report the standard deviation of the difference in the 545 
Version 2.0, January 18, 2019   15 
 measurements.  Since this is unknown, yet needed for the power calculation, an estimate 546 
was derived using the two treatment groups reported by the Battelino et al (26) using 547 
Altman (27). This derivation yielded a value of 25.7.  It is acknowledged that the two 548 
treatment groups reported by Battelino et al (26) are different than those investigated in 549 
this protocol (and the groups were independent rather than paired), but since similarities 550 
exist the derived estimate is sufficient for preliminary power calculations.  Table 1 551 
reports that when the standard deviation of the difference is 25, this investigation will 552 
have over 99% power to detect a difference between the two insulin groups.  Since 25 is a 553 
low estimate, Table 1 also reports standard deviation estimates up to 110, and reports that 554 
>80% power is achieved up to 106 but <80% when the standard deviation of the 555 
difference is >106. Assuming that the standard deviation of the difference in this 556 
investigation will be < 106 minutes is justified given that the value of this standard 557 
deviation in a previous  study (26) is 25.7 which is well below the 106 threshold. In 558 
anticipation of potential drop- outs 25 subjects will be recruited . 559

Comparisons will be made using Student’s paired t -tests (two -sided) for normative and 565 
log-transformed data, Wilcoxon signed rank testing for non- parametric data , and N1 chi - 566 
square tests for proportions (30) . Data will be expressed wherever possible as mean 567 
difference with 95% confidence limits for the difference or as mean +  standard error or 568 
deviation for the difference. For non- parametric data, these will be presented as median 569 
differences with inter -quartile ranges. All data will be analysed on an intention to treat 570 
basis. No interim analysis is anticipated.  Furthermore, to gain as much information as 571 
possible from this pilo t study, all hypotheses will be tested at 0.05 and no adjustments for 572 
multiplicity will be made.  573

 678 
RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING  679 
 680 
The study is open label so no blinding is required.  At randomisation the subjects will be 681 
randomised to Degludec or Glargine as their basal insulin  with the direction of travel 682 
identical for both basal insulin periods .  Randomi zation will be performed using a 683 
computer generated sequence system. There will be a 2 week wash -out period between 684 
each set of trips.    685 
 686 
 687 
CONCOM ITANT ILLNESSES AND MEDICATIONS  688 
 689 
Definitions:  690 
Concomitant illness is defined as any illness that is present at the start of the trial (i.e. at 691 
the first visit).  Concomitant medication are any medications (including over -the-counter) 692 
other than Degludec or Glargine that are taken during the trial. At t he screening visit the 693 
research team will base inclusion or exclusion of each subject according the criteria listed 694 
above. Details of all concomitant illnesses and medication will be recorded at trial entry 695 
(i.e. at the first visit). Any changes in concomi tant medication will be recorded at each 696 
visit.  The information collected for each concomitant medication includes, at a 697 
minimum, start date, stop date or continuing, and indication. For each concomitant 698 
illness, date of onset, date of resolution or continuing, at a minimum, will be recorded.  699 
 700 
 701 
ADVERSE EVENTS  702 
 703 
An adverse event (AE)  is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 704 
clinical investigation subject administered /using a Product  that affect the risk/benefit ratio 705 
of the study; the rights, safety, or welfare of the participants or others; or the  integrity of 706 
data of the study. An Adverse Event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended 707 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 708 
associated with the use of a Product, whether or not considered related to the Product. 709 
This includes events reported from the first trial related activity after the subject has 710 
signed the informed consent and until post treatment follow -up period as defined in the 711 
protocol. The following should not be recorded as AEs, if recorded as medical 712 
history/concomitant illness on the CRF at screening:  713 
• Pre -planned procedure, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has    714 
worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed 715 
consent  716 
• Pre -existing conditions found as a result of screening procedures  717 
  718 
Serious Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR):  719 
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an adverse event (AE) for which a causal relationship 720 
to the trial product is at least possible i.e. causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be 721 
Version 2.0, January 18, 2019   19 
 dismissed. Serious adverse reaction (SAR): Adverse event which fulfils both the criteria 722 
for a Serious Adverse Event and the criteria for an Adverse Reaction.  723 
 724 
Serious Adverse Events  725 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any event that  results in the following : 726 
• Death  727 
• A life -threatening* experience  728 
• In-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalization 729 
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  730 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  731 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening*, or require  732 
  hospi talization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 733 
judgement, they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical 734 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition  735 
• Suspicion of transmission of inf ectious agents  736 
*The term life -threatening in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject 737 
was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which 738 
hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.  739 
 740 
 741 
Adverse Event Reporting 742 
The sponsor -investigator will collect the following information at minimum for each of 743 
these events : 744 
1. Study name  745 
2. Patient identification (e.g. initials, sex, age)  746 
3. Event (preferably a diagnosis)  747 
4. Trial Drug  748 
5. Reporter identification (e.g. Name, or initials)  749 
6. Causality  750 
7. Outcome  751 
All adverse events will be reported by the investigator and reviewed by Novo Nordisk in 752 
compliance with applicable regulations. Adverse events may be volunteered by subjects, 753 
elicited by the investigator or designee, or collected via observation by the investigator. 754 
 755 
All AEs will be assessed by the investigator who will determine whether or not the event 756 
is related to the study procedures or related to the study device, and whether or not the 757 
event meets serious criteria.  If it is determined that an AE has occurred, the investigator 758 
will be responsible for reporting of all adverse events , including serious adverse events 759 
(SAE) and  serious adverse drug reactions (SADRs) , to the compet ent authority and 760 
independent ethics committee/institutional review boards based upon federal regulations 761 
and local/IRB policies.  762 
 763 
Adverse events will be assessed on an ongoing basis throughout the study. Adverse event 764 
reporting will begin at the start time of the study (i.e., insertion of the CGM sensor during 765 
Visit #1) and continue through until subject participation has ended (i.e., either time of 766 
the post -discharge telephone follow - up, or time of study exit if the subject was 767 
Version 2.0, January 18, 2019   20 
 discontinued early from t he study). All adverse events will be followed until resolution, 768 
or until the AE has stabilized, or until the study has been completed.  769 
 770 
Pre-existing medical conditions or symptoms observed prior to the start time of the study 771 
will not be recorded as an AE  and will be collected in the subject’s medical history. In the 772 
event there is a change (i.e., worsening) in the pre -existing medical condition or 773 
symptoms after the start of the open loop phase, then an AE will be reported.  Typical 774 
events such as a mild cold, stomach flu, headache, etc, that are self -limiting and do not 775 
meet any aforementioned reporting requirements, will not be reported to the IRB. 776 
 777 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting 778 
All SAEs  and SADRs  will be reported to Novo Nordisk at the same time such events are 779 
reported to regulatory authorities or within 15 days from the sponsor -investigator 780 
becoming aware of such adverse events, whichever comes first. . All events will be 781 
documented on the corresponding eCRF. SDRI  will also be responsible for submitting 782 
relevant source documentation for the SAE. If the subject is hospitalized because of or 783 
during the course of an SAE, then a copy of the hospital discharge summary will also be 784 
included with the SAE source documentation. In case of death, the invest igator will make 785 
every effort to obtain a copy of the death certificate to submit to Novo Nordisk. When 786 
submitting copies of source documentation, all subject identifying information will be 787 
redacted and only the unique subject number will be used to label  the forms for 788 
identification purposes.  789 
 790 
Withdrawal from the study and all therapeutic measures will be at the discretion of the 791 
investigator. All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the 792 
investigator deems the event to be chronic o r the subject to be stable.  793 
 794 
For any event where there is suspicion that the study device is involved, the investigator 795 
will return the device to Novo Nordisk for evaluation. The investigator will provide 796 
procedures for cleaning and preparation of contaminated product as well as shipping 797 
materials for the return of used and potentially biohazardous materials.  798 
  799 
 800 
MANAGEMENT OF HYPOGLYCEMIA  801 
 802 
Fast acting oral carbohydrates wil l be used to treat hypoglycaemia. Staff will have 803 
Glucagon available as needed for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia. All treatment for 804 
hypoglycemia will be recorded on study forms.  805 
 806 
A SM BG with the glucose meter should be tested anytime there is:  807 
• A low threshold alert (set at 70 mg/dL) on the CGM  808 
• Anytime the participant has symptoms of hypoglycemia  809 
• Anytime staff has concern about the potential for hypoglycemia  810 
• Following treatment for hypoglycemia as indicated 811 
 812 
Hypoglycemia/Hyperglycemia Event Reporting  813 
Version 2.0, January 18, 2019   21 
 For the purpose of this protocol, mild symptom s of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia 814 
(i.e., clinically non- significant) or blood glucose values out of the normal range (whether 815 
or not they resulted in delayed meals or correction boluses) will not be reported as SAEs 816 
unless determined to meet the criteria  below for SAE reporting.  817 
 818 
Hypoglycemic events are recorded as SAEs if the event required assistance of another 819 
person due to altered consciousness and required another person to actively administer 820 
carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. T his means that the subject was 821 
impaired cognitively to the point that they were unable to treat themselves, they were 822 
unable to verbalize their needs, they were incoherent, disoriented, and/or combative, or 823 
they experienced seizure or coma. These episodes may be associated with sufficient 824 
neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma. If plasma glucose measurements are not 825 
available during such an event, neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of 826 
plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient e vidence that the event was induced by 827 
a low plasma glucose concentration.  828 
 829 
Adverse Event Relatedness  830 
The investigator will be responsible for making a determination on the causal relationship 831 
of the AE. Specifically, the investigator will report whether th e AE was related to the 832 
study procedure, study drug, and/or related to the study device (malfunction of any 833 
component of the Dexcom System). 834 
 835 
The causal relationship to the study procedure and the study device for each adverse 836 
event will be rated as follow s: 837 
• Unrelated: The event is not related to the study drug. 838 
• Possibly Related: The temporal sequence is such that the relationship is not 839 
unlikely or there is no contradicting evidence that can reasonably explain the 840 
subject’s condition. There is a possibilit y of any relation between the event and 841 
the study drug. 842 
• Related: The event is related or most likely associated with the study drug. 843

Plainsboro, NJ: Novo Nordisk Inc; March 2018.  846 
 847 
Adverse Event Severity  848 
The severity of the AE will be rated based upon the following grades:  849 
• Mild – asymptomatic or mild symptoms; usually transient, requires no special 850 
treatments, and does not interfere with the subject’s daily activities  851 
• Moderate – minimal, local or non- invasive  intervention  indicated; usually causes 852 
a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and may interfere with 853 
daily activities, but is usually ameliorated by simple therapeutic measures  854 
• Severe – medically significant, life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of 855 
hospitalization indicated; interrupts a subject’s usual daily activities and generally 856 
requires system drug therapy or other treatment.  857 
 858 
Pregnancy : 859 
Version 2.0, January 18, 2019   22 
 The study subjects will be instructed to notify the sponsor -investigator immediately if 860 
they becom e pregnant.  861 
The sponsor -investigator will report to Novo Nordisk any pregnancy occurring during the 862 
trial period. Reporting of the pregnancy by the sponsor -investigator will occur within the 863 
same timelines described above for reporting of Adverse Events.  864 
Pregnancy complications will be recorded as adverse event(s). If the infant has a 865 
congenital anomaly/birth defect this must be reported and followed up as a serious 866 
adverse event.  867 
 868 
Liability and subject insurance : 869 
For this study, the Sansum Diabetes Research Institute will provide adequate medical 870 
care to the study subject for any study- related adverse events, including clinically 871 
significant laborato ry values related to the study. Medical care for study subjects will be 872 
provided regardless of their insurance status. Sansum Diabetes Research Institute agrees 873 
to indemnify Novo Nordisk in accordance with the written contract executed between the 874 
parties for this study.  875 
 876 
Publication plan : 877 
It is the expectation that data from this study will be presented at meeting(s) of learned 878 
societies and submitted for publication in appropriate and high impact journals within the 879 
timelines outlined above. It is our intent to register the study with a publicly assessable 880 
database such as clinicaltrials.gov.  881

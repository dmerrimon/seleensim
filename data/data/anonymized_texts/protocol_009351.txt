Version 1.0  Date: 28 March  2019  1 Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according 
to US and international standards of Good Clinical Pra ctice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and 
International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and 
Institutional research policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background  
 
Anesthesia and analgesia are increasingly recognized as integral part s of inpatient and outpatient 
management of infants, children, and adolescents.1 However, many anesthetics and analgesics are not 
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in children due to inadequate  information on 
drug efficacy, safety, and dosing in pediatric populations.2,3 In order to assure optimal pharmacotherapy, 
it is imperative to select the correct drug dose. The Pediatric Trials Network (PTN) seeks t o complete 
safety and efficacy stud ies of understudied  but commonly -admini stered anesthetics to children,  The 
studies will help define an optimal dosing regimen  for pediatric populations. In order to complete these 
studies  and submit data to the US FDA for  update of pediatric labeling , the PTN requires outcome 
measures for sedation levels that have been thoroughly validated. Existing clinician report pediatric 
sedation scales do not have adequate  qualitative evidence to support c ontent validity for any of t hese 
scales to be used as outcome measures . 
 
This Study  
 
This study will conduct qualitative interviews to provide evidence for the content validity and 
comprehension of existing physician -reported measures of sedation levels of children receiving anesthes ia 
to facilitate a diagnostic or surgical pr ocedure.  Information gained from this study will inform the use of 
the measure in studies that are part of the PTN.  
 
2 Study Objectives  
Primary Objective  
To assess the content validity  and physician understanding  of the Pediatric Sedation State Scale 
(PSSS) and the University of Michigan Sedation Scale ( UMSS ) via cognitive interviewing  
methods . 
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
This is a qualitative , questionnaire validation study using 1 hour, phone -based cognitive 
interviews with pediatric anesthesiologists and pediatric critical care physicians.  Participation 
will last for the duration of the 1 hour phone interview.  
3.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
The two co -primary study endpoint s are physicians’  1) comprehension of items a nd response 
options on clinician reported pediatric sedation scales , and 2) evaluation of the relevance of the 
scale to capture sedation levels.

Version 1.0  Date: 28 March  2019  4 Subject Selection and Withdrawal  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
1. Is a pr acticing clinician in a clinical  care environment   
2. Cares for pediatric patients >50% of their time  
3. Treats or works with pediatric patients who are sedated/anesthetized for diagnostic 
and/or therapeutic procedures  
4. Holds one of the following titles/positions  
a. Anesthesiologist  
b. Pediatric critical care physicia n 
c. Clinical pharmacist (PharmD)  
d. Nurse anesthetist  
e. Nurse practitioner  
f.     Physician assistant  
g. Nurse (with a BSN/RN or higher)  
5. Is over the age of 18  years  
6. Can speak English  
7. Is capable of giving informed verbal consent  
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
1. Lack of access to a  telephone for interview  
4.3 Subject Recruitment and Screening  
Participants  will recruit ed via phone and email .  
 
Email s will be  sent to clinicians by Pediatric Trials Network (PTN) staff members and study 
staff. The email will contain brief information about the study  (recruitment materials) , a Study 
Information Sheet attachment  (in place of a consent form with approval of a waiver of 
documentation of informed consent) , and contact information for study personnel .  Clinicians 
interested in participating may use the information in the email to contact study personnel .  
 
Phone calls will be made by study staff to PTN member clinicians. An approved IRB phone 
script will be used by study staff making calls to potential participants.  
 
Because clinicians are busy, w e expect that recruitment for the study will require a number of 
contacts before we can schedule physicians for the interview. We will keep a list of any 
clinicians who refuse participation so that they will not be subsequently contacted during the 
recruit ment period.  
 
Study staff will review the Study Information Sheet with potential participants, answer any 
questions the clinician has about the study, and screen interested clinicians for eligibility using 
self-reported information obtained over the phone or via email .

Version 1.0  Date: 28 March  2019  4.4 Subject Consent  
Given the design and topic of this interview study (content validity and comprehension of 
clinician reported outcome measures of pediatric sedation), we believe this study qualifies  for 
Exempt Research status under 45 CFR 46 .104(d)(2)(ii) because:  
 
 The research involves only the use of standard interview  procedures; and  
 
 We will have robust confidentiality protections in place to protect the data —but even in 
the unlikely event of participants’ responses being disclosed in ide ntifiable form, we do 
not believe participants would reasonably be placed at risk of criminal or civil liability or 
that the responses would be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, 
or reputation. Our topic is neither personal nor se nsitive, and the questions posed to 
partic ipants are intended to ascertain whether the design of a survey is adequate to 
assume content validity and comprehension of survey items and responses by users of the 
questionnaire , not right or wrong answers.  
 
This study does not involve patients; participants will be health care professionals. Participants 
will be provided with a Study Information Sheet that includes a brief description of the study 
objectives and procedures, along with information on data safety and confidentiality.  
 
Agreement to participate in the survey and/or interview will serve as consent to participate in the 
study.   
 
4.5 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.5.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
As this study is a qualitative interview study lasting for on ly 1-hour, we do not anticipate having 
to withdraw subjects from the study based on safety or non -compliance. However, there may be 
instances in which a participant needs to end the interview early. In these instances, we will work 
to schedule a new time t o complete the interview  within the following two weeks . If the 
interview cannot be scheduled for completion within 14 days , we will retain the already collected 
data from the participant and consider any uncollected data as missing.  
5 Study Procedures  
Participants will take part in a semi -structured qualitative interview (~1 hour).  
 
One day before the interview, the participant will receive a reminder email with details about 
their phone interview time, the study information sheet, and three documents for use during the 
interview: Definitions (of sedation levels), Scale A (PSSS), and Scale B (UMSS).  
 
At the start of the interview, the interviewer will ask the participant if they received the email 
with the attachments and ask them to pull the email up as t he materials will be referenced during 
the interview. The interviewer will send a new copy of the materials if the participant cannot 
locate them.

Version 1.0  Date: 28 March  2019   
Participants will then be given a demographic survey, which will be read aloud to them over the 
phone and c ompleted by the interviewer based on answers given by the participant.  
 
After the demographics survey, the interviewer will begin the interview using the interview 
guide. The interview will consist of cognitive interviewing questions related to the survey  
instructions and the surveys’ items and response options on 2 different clinician report pediatric 
sedation scales, the Pediatric Sedation State Scale and the University of Michigan Sedation 
Scale.  
 
Example questions may include:  
 
1. Which scales have you previously used to measure sedation levels in your pediatric patients?  
a. [For any scale mentioned]  
i. How long have you used the [name of referenced scale]?  
ii. What strengths do you think the [name of referenced scale] has?  
iii. What limitations do you think the [name of referenced scale] has?  
2. How clear are the scale instructions?  
3. Looking at the sedation level categories in this scale, how clearly do you think each level is 
defined?  
a. How distinct do you think each category’s definition is from the others?  
b. Are there any terms or phrases that are unclear or might create confusion when scoring 
a child on these levels?  
c. Are they appropriate for pediatric patients in the following age ranges?  
i. <2 year  
ii. 2-6 
iii. 6-12 
iv. 12-18 
 
At the conclusion of the interview, the interviewer will tha nk the participant for their time and send the 
participant the forms to complete for participant payment. Once forms are completed and returned, the 
interviewer will process an AP check request to have the participant paid.  
6 Statistical Plan  
6.1 Sample Size De termination  
Cognitive interviewing seeks to assess the way in which questionnaire content is understood to 
ensure that what is expected to be measured is actually being measured. The  type of logical and 
  Page 6 
CONFIDENTIAL

Version 1.0  Date: 28 March  2019  structural problems that we wish to identify are rela tively independent of sample size and 
approximately 5 -15 intervi ews per round  is a generally accepted guideline for  cognitive 
interviews.4 Multiple rounds may be needed if questions need to be revised and retested. Our 
sample minimum sample size will be 18 and the maximum will be 24. This will pr ovide a more 
than adequate sample size. Additionally, the sample will include a minimum of 2 
anesthesiologists, 2 critical care physicians, and 2 nurses to ensure we obtain responses from a 
variety of clinical care professionals.  
6.2 Statistical Methods  
Quali tative research does not incorporate standard statistical methodology, but rather uses 
qualitative analysis methodologies. In this study, a t least two analysts will independently review 
transcripts and debriefing forms. During the initial transcript review s, transcripts will be double 
coded (the same transcript independently coded by two analysts) and coding results compared. 
This will continue until an inter -coder reliability of at least 90% is reached on double coded 
transcripts. After inter -coder reliabi lity is reached, transcripts will be coded individually by only 
one analyst with the exception of every 6th transcript, which will be double coded to ensure the 
continuation of inter -coder reliability. Once review and coding is complete, we will create an 
item-tracking matrix to document changes to the measure, as well as reasons for those changes. 
A summary report will be compiled  with our analysis, detailing our process and our findings 
from the cognitive interviews.  
6.3  Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
All participants enrolled into the study who complete phone interviews will be included in the 
study analysis.  
7 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
7.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to Good 
Clinical  Practice (GCP) guidelines. All paper based data will be stored in a locked filing cabinet 
in the locked file room of the Population Health Sciences Department. All electronic data will be 
stored on the secure network server of the Department of Population  Health sciences where study 
space accessible to only IRB approved study personnel will have access to the study space. 
Identifiable information such as names, phone numbers and email addresses will only be 
recorded for the purposes of scheduling and track ing enrollment/refusals and will be destroyed 
once enrollment is complete. Audio recordings will be destroyed at the completion of data 
analysis.  
 
This study does not collect protected health information (or health information of any kind).  
7.2 Source Docume nts 
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source 
data are contained in source documents .   Examples of the se original documents, and data 
records include: hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, 
  Page 7 
CONFIDENTIAL

Version 1.0  Date: 28 March  2019  subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from 
automated instruments, copies or transcr iptions certified after verification as being accurate and 
complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject 
files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments 
involve d in the clinical trial.  
7.3 Case Report Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All 
data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on 
the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write 
“N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be 
printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has been made, to correct such an er ror, draw a 
single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such 
changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERRORS.  For 
clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarificatio n above the item, then initial and 
date it.  
7.4 Records Retention  
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for at least 3 years after 
the study is completed, in compliance with NIH policies . Essential documents include finan cial 
and programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records that 
are required by the terms of a grant, or may reasonably be considered pertinent to a grant . 
Individual participant data will be retained, at a minimum, thr ough the completion of data 
analysis, but no longer than 3 years. Study results will be retained in participant’s research  record 
for at least six years  after the study is completed. At that time the research information will be 
destroyed or information id entifying participants  will be removed fr om such study results at 
DUHS. No information from this study is entered into DUHS Medical Records.  
 
8 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
8.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
This study will be monitored via weekly data rev iew meetings and quality control (QC) reviews 
of data files.  Weekly data review meetings will include review of study operations including 
enrollment progress, recruitment issues, and review of data summaries from interviews 
completed in the previous week.  Data summary reviews will include discussion of completeness 
of data, quality of data, and how effective the interview guides are at collecting the desired data.  
Weekly QC checks for the study will include checking that enrollment logs , participant 
ident ifiers for scheduling and for the do not re -contact” list , all audio recordings, and all 
transcripts  are stored in the app ropriate folder on the secure DPHS server. Consent will be 
obtained verbally, so no consent form review will occur. All encrypted audi o recorders will be 
checked weekly to ensure no audio files are left on them after being moved to the DPHS secure 
folder for this study. Additionally, the first 3 interview transcripts obtained on the study and 10% 
of subsequent transcripts will be checked  to ensure that interviewers are not deviating from

Version 1.0  Date: 28 March  2019  interview scope and are completing interviews as planned. The investigator  and Research 
Program Leader  will allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities.   
 
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by the EC/IRB, the 
sponsor, government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups 
of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection 
instrumen ts, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of 
applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspecti on by 
government regulatory authorities and applicable University compliance and quality assurance 
offices.  
9 Ethical Considerations  
Given the study design (qualitative interview) and the study topic (content validity and 
comprehension  of questionnaire items ), we believe this study may qualify for Exempt Research 
status under 45 CFR 46.104(d)(2) (ii). This is because the research involves only the use of 
standard interview procedures. In addition, no personal health information will be collected, and 
the audio -recordings will be destroyed after publication of the interview findings. In the unlikely 
event of interviewees’ responses being disclosed in identifiable form, we do not believe they 
would reasonably be placed at risk of criminal or civil liability or be  damaging to the subjects' 
financial standing, employability, or reputation.  
 
This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical 
Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guideline s), 
applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted independent 
Ethics Committee (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement with  local legal 
prescriptions, for formal approval of the study conduct.  The decision of the EC/IRB concerning 
the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator and a copy of this decision 
will be provided to the sponsor before commencemen t of this study.  The investigator should 
provide a list of EC/IRB members and their affiliate to the sponsor.  
 
Per the waiver of documentation of informed consent obtained by this study, a ll subjects for this 
study will be provided a Study Information She et and allowed to ask questions about the study 
prior to agreeing to participate in the study . Agreement to participate in the study will constitute 
consent.  The Study Information Sheet  will be submitted with the protocol for review and 
approval by the EC/ IRB for the study.

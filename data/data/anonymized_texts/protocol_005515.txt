1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
1.1 Study Disease  
 
Due in part to the widespread use of abdominal imaging procedures, the incidence of renal tumors 
has incremented exponentially over the last several decades [1]. The National Cancer Institute 
estimates the incidence of new cases of renal cell carcinoma in 2011 at 60,920  [2]. The increasing 
detection of incidental small renal masses on abdominal imaging has been accompanied by a clear 
downward stage migration, such that by 2007, close to 60% of renal tumors measured < 4 cm  [3, 
4]. Indeed, about 50% of the patients referred to urologists today for suspected renal malignancy 
have incidentally discovered asymptomatic small renal mass es [5]. 
Importantly, the highest incidence of these tumors is seen in elderly patients, who usually present with a number of comorbidities[6] . In treating patients with renal masses, three competing factors 
have to be balanced:  cancer control, patient morbidity, and preservation of renal function.  
Preservation of renal functi on is a key factor in survival. With mounting evidence highlighting the 
importance of renal preservation [7 -10] and documentation of the oncologic efficacy of partial 
nephrectomy [11] , the American Urological Association’s guidelines currently place partial 
nephrectomy as the standard of care for the management of T1a tumors (< 4 cm) and as an 
alternative treatment option for T1b tumors (4-7 cm) [12].  Reflecting this paradigm shift, t he use 
of partial nephrectomy has risen substantially at many centers of excellence over the past decade, 
approaching 90% for T1a tumors [13].
 
With evidence demonstrating improved patient survival following partial rather than radical 
nephrectomy, nephron- sparing surgery (NSS) has become the standard of care for the management 
of T1a renal tumors and an accepted alternative for the management of T1b tumors [14, 15 ].  
Furthermore, as the use of minimally invasive technology has advanced within the urologic community, laparoscopic partial nephrectomy and robot -assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) 
have been established as viable alternatives to open NSS [16, 17].   
Open NSS traditionally involves clamping of the renal hilar vessels and an abundant use of ice to 
ensure tissue hypothermia.  However, techniques of achieving kidney hypothermia have not been translated to minimally invasive NSS.  Thus, renal hilar clamping during minimally invasive NSS 
is performed under warm ischemia.  Increased duration of warm ischemia time (WIT) has been 
demonstrated to negatively impact short and long -term renal function [ 18].  As a result, many 
techniques for limiting WIT have been described, including segmental renal artery clamping, renal parenchymal clamping, early unclamping,  and unclamped NSS following administration of 
hypotensive agents [19-22].  
  
Figenshau  
Off Clamp Randomization v6  Page 5 of 18 05.01.15  Several years ago, the Principal Investigator developed a technique where RAPN is performed 
without clamping of the renal hilar vessels and without systemic blood pressure manipulation.  
This technique is applicable to all renal tumors that are appropriate for partial nephrectomy.  
In order to determine the efficacy of this procedure, a  retrospective  chart review , matched cohort 
study was performed at Washington University comparing 29 patients who underwent off -clamp 
RAPN for suspected renal cell carcinoma with a matched 29 patients that underwent RAP N with 
hilar clamping. The procedures were performed from 3/2008 to 9/2011, and the patients in each 
group were similar in nephrometry score  and baseline renal function.  The off -clamp patients 
experienced an estimated blood loss of 146.4cc, while the hila r clamped RAPN  group had an 
estimated blood loss of 103.9cc (p=0.039).  The complications were similar in the two groups with 
no complications seen in the off -clamp group and only one Clavien -2 complication in the hilar 
clamp group.  The mean eGFR decline was 4.9 ml/min/1.73m2 in the off -clamp group and 
11.7ml/min/1.73m2 in the hilar clamp group (p=0.033).  In summary, the off -clamp RAPN patients 
experienced less decline in renal function while experiencing similar morbidity [23].  
These preliminary results  have shown comparable perioperative outcomes to traditional clamped 
RAPN, while mitigating renal functional damage and providing excellent oncologic control.  To 
date, we have submitted for publication: 1) video and detailed description of our off -clamp RAPN 
technique, 2) safety and efficacy of this technique in our initial 42 patient experience, 3) safety and efficacy of our technique for technically difficult renal tumors, and 4) a retrospective matched cohort study comparing off -clamp to clamped RAPN.  We aim to prospectively compare renal 
functional, perioperative and oncologic outcomes between our off -clamp technique and traditional 
clamped RAPN.   
1.2 Rationale 
 
Randomizing patients to either traditional clamped  RAPN or off-clamp technique will allow for 
prospective data in regards to the effect of hilar clamping on renal function. We hypothesize that 
the off-clamp RAPN technique will lead to decreased decline in renal function compared to  the 
on-clamp RAPN.    
 
2.0 OBJECTIVES 
 
2.1 Primary Objective  
 
1. To determine if off-clamp RAPN technique better preserves long-term renal function 
than the traditional clamped RAPN technique. 
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
1. To determine if oncologic outcomes are equivalent between off -clamp and traditional 
clamped RAPN . 
 
2. To determine if the complication severity and rates are equivalent between off- clamp 
Figenshau  
Off Clamp Randomization v6  Page 6 of 18 05.01.15  technique and traditional clamped RAPN. 
 
3. To determine if  off-clamp RAPN technique requires longer operative times or 
prolongs hospital stay . 
 
4. To determine if off-clamp RAPN technique caus es greater blood loss during surgery.  
 
 
3.0 PATIENT SELECTION 
 
3.1 Inclusion Criteria 
1.  Patients 18 and older. 
2.  Patients willing and able to sign consent.  
3.  Patients with an organ confined renal mass planning to undergo a robotic assisted 
partial nephrectomy (RAPN). 
4.  Patient with Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) equal to or greater than 40. 
 
3.2 Exclusion Criteria 
 
1.  Patients under 18. 
2.  Patients with Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) less than 40. 
3.  Patients with non -organ confined renal masses (invading renal vein, inferior vena                     
cava, peri -renal tissue, ipsilateral adrenal gland, or metastasis).  
4.  Patients with bilateral synchronous renal masses.  
5.  Patients who can not discontinue, P lavix, Coumadin or other anti- platelet or anti -
coagulant medications.  
6.  Patients with renal lesions determined to be too complex to perform a RAPN without 
clamp by the surgeon. (The renal mass may be deemed too difficult based on pre-operatively  radiological findings. The surgeon’s decision to exclude a mass from a 
robotic assisted partial nephrectomy would be based on a higher risk of positive margin or complication if a RAPN was performed. ) 
 
3.3 Inclusion  of Women and Minorities 
 
Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this 
trial. 
  
4.0 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
 
Patients must not start any protocol intervention prior to registration through the 
Siteman Cancer Center.  
 
The following steps must be taken before registering patients to this study:  
 
1. Confirmation of patient eligibility  
2. Registration of patient in the Siteman Cancer Center database  
3. Assignment of unique patient number (UPN) 
Figenshau  
Off Clamp Randomization v6  Page 7 of 18 05.01.15   
4.1 Confirmation of Patient Eligibility  
 
The following information is required to confirm patient eligibility prior to registering 
patient: 
 
1. Registering MD’s name  
2. Patient’s race, sex, and DOB  
3. Three letters (or two letters and a dash) for the patient’s initials  
4. Copy of signed consent form 
5. Planned date of enrollment 
6. Completed eligibility  checklist, signed and dated by a member of the study team  
7. Copy of appropriate source documentation confirming patient eligibility 
 
4.2 Patient Registration in the Siteman Cancer Center Database  
 
All patients must be registered through the Siteman Cancer Cente r database  (SCCdb). 
 
4.3 Assignment of UPN 
 
For the purpose of this study, e ach patient will be identified with a unique patient number 
(UPN) which will be assigned consecutively at the time of registration in the SCCdb.        
All data will be recorded with this identification number on the appropriate CRFs.  The 
UPN will not include the patient’s initials as this is considered identifiable information per Siteman Cancer Center Guidelines.  
 
 
5.0 TREATMENT PLAN 
 
5.1 Preoperative Evaluation 
 
Patients will be evalu ated to det ermine whether the y meet the criteria specified in 
Section 3.1.  Patien ts meeting these criteria will continue to next step. 
 
Patients   will   have   standard   of   care blood work which will include serum creatinine , 
preoperatively. Tumor characteristics based on preoperative cross -sectional imaging will be 
recorded, particularly components of the nephrometry score . 
  
5.2 Operative Procedure 
 
5.2.1. Randomization 
Randomization will take place in the operating room, after feasibility of RAPN off clamp 
is confirmed.  Patients will be randomized to either off -clamp RAPN or traditional clamped 
RAPN in a 1:1 ratio, for a total of 40 patients allocated to each group.  To  minimize 
selection bias, a randomization table will be developed be fore initiation of enrollment. 
Figenshau  
Off Clamp Randomization v6  Page 8 of 18 05.01.15  Envelopes containing randomization assignments will be created, sequentially numbered 
and sealed.  Once enrollment is initiated, randomization envelopes will  be opened for each 
subject after informed consent is granted and study eligibility is confirmed  in the operating 
room. 
5.2.2. Day of surgery 
 
Standard preoperative and perioperative procedures for RAPN will be followed in both 
groups.  For the control group (traditional clamped technique), RAPN will be performed 
in the standard fashion.  For the treatment group (off -clamp technique), RAPN will be 
performed with our off- clamp technique.  There is also a possible chance the procedure 
may be switched intraoperatively due to a variety of factors. For example, intraoperatively a patient undergoing a RAPN off -clamp may require emergent conversion to a traditional 
hilar clamped RAPN for excessiv e bleeding. Also, a patient undergoing either RAPN off -
clamp or traditional hilar clamped RAPN could require conversion to either open partial nephrectomy, open radical nephrectomy, or laparoscopic radical nephrectomy given intraoperative conditions. A change in technique would only take place if required to 
maintain patient safety.  
 
5.2.3. Description of the off -clamp RAPN technique         
         
In the off- clamp RAPN technique, after surgical access is gained, kidney is mobilized and 
Gerota’s fascia is  incised. The perinephric fat is dissected away from the renal capsule to 
expose the tumor.  
Intravenous mannitol (12.5 grams) is administered by anesthesia. Two robotic bulldog 
clamps are introduced to allow for expeditious clamping of the hilum if necess ary. The 
margins of the mass are outlined circumferentially with monopolar electrocautery on the robotic scissors. This cautery is continued until an appropriate plane of dissection is found. Forceps are used to bluntly separate the tumor from the residual  renal parenchyma with 
intervening tissue cauterized meticulously with the monopolar scissors. If a large vessel 
from the renal parenchyma is noted to be bleeding during tumor excision, the robotic 
bulldogs can be applied to the vessel in the resection bed. This controls the bleeding vessel(s) until suture ligation or clip application of the vessel(s) can be performed.  Additionally, larger vessels that are directly supplying the tumor can be controlled with 
clips if hemostasis with cautery is not adequate.  Mobilization of the tumor is continued 
circumferentially until complete excision of the tumor is achieved. The bedside assistant 
uses suction and applies countertraction as necessary during tumor excision. The specimen 
is then placed above the liver or spleen for later retrieval.  
The base of the resection bed is cauterized. The insufflation pressure of the 
Figenshau  
Off Clamp Randomization v6  Page 9 of 18 05.01.15  pneumoperitoneum is decreased and the resection bed is examined for any ongoing 
bleeding. 
Any patent venous sinuses or arteries at the base of the resection are oversewn . If the 
collecting system has been entered, it is similarly closed. The defect in the renal 
parenchyma is closed using a sliding clip renorrhaphy technique .  Gerota’s fascia is then 
similarly reapproximated.  
The specimen is entrapped  in a specimen bag and then the robot is undocked. The specimen 
is removed through a port site with extension of the incision as necessary. 
The fascia for the ports is closed  and skin is reapproximated . 
5.3 Risks of R APN 
There are multiple potential risks associated with a RAPN.  Complications include but are not limited to the following: hemorrhage requiring transfusion, urinary leak/fistula, 
abscess, loss of renal function, injury to surrounding organs, conversion to an open surgery, conversion to a radical nephrectomy, incisional hernia, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. 
A recent multi- institutional study reported complication rates for 450 RAPN procedures.  
The overall complication rate was 15.8% with 76.1% Clavien grade I -II and 23.9% Clavien 
grade III -IV.  Hemorrhage requiring a transfusion occur red in 5.1%  and arterial 
embolization to stop hemorrhage in 0.4%.  A urine leak occurred in 1.6% with no patient 
requiring explorative operations for urinary leak.  Intra -operative conversion to radical 
nephrectomy occurred in 1.6%.  No deaths occurred in the 450 cases. 
 
5.4 Postoperative Care 
 
The postoperative management i s standard of c are for all patients who undergo R APN. 
   
                          Three month post op visit:  
• CR/eGFR  
• Renal Scan  
• CT/MRI of abdomen  
• Chest x-ray (CXR)  
 
 
 
5.5 Duration of Follow -Up 
 
The follow up management is standard of care but uniquely different for patients based on 
pathologic outcome.  Patients with a malignant (cancerous) surgical pathology will be 
followed for a period of 3 years.  Patients with a benign (non -cancerous) surgic al pathology 
will only be followed through a period of 3 months postoperatively.  Patients remov ed from 
Figenshau  
Off Clamp Randomization v6  Page 10 of 18 05.01.15  this study for una cceptable adver se events will be follow ed until resolution or 
stabilization of the adver se event. 
 
   Yearly follow up visits: 
• CR/eGFR  
• CT/MRI of abdomen  
• Chest x-ray (CXR)  
 
 
5.6 Criteria for R emoval from Study 
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the 
patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to proceed with the protocol intervention, the patient should be removed from the study and the reason(s) for 
discontinuation documented in the case report forms.  Otherwise, the patient will receive the intervention and be followed as described.

9.0 STATISTICAL CONSI DERATIONS 
 
9.1 Study Objectives and Endpoints 
 Primary Outcome:  
Eval
uation of renal function following RAPN with or without hilar clamping 
using:  
1. Decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). eGFR is calculated from 
serum creatinine using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula [11].  Decline in eGFR = Postoperative eGFR – Preoperative eGFR.  
2. Decline in split renal function (SRF). SRF is a percentage of the total renal 
function supplied by one kidney.  Ideally each kidney has a SFR of 50%.  SRF is 
measured during renal scintigraphy (renal scan).  Decline is SRF =preoperative 
SRF- postoperative SRF (3 month). 
 
 Secondary Outcomes:  
      1.   Oncological outcomes: 
a. Pathological results  
  1. Pathologic margin status   2. Tumor histology, including Fuhrman grade if applicable  
  3. Distance between tumor margin and surgical margin 
Figenshau  
Off Clamp Randomization v6  Page 13 of 18 05.01.15                    b. Evidence of disease recurrence or metastasis on follow -up imaging  
              1. Recurrence free survival  
             2.   Perioperative outcomes          
a. Estimate d blood loss 
b. Operative time and warm ischemia time  
c. Intra-operative complications, including but not limited to injury to  the 
surrounding organs and vessels, excessive blood loss requiring blood 
transfusions, and conversion to radical nephrectomy or open surgery.  
d. Length of postoperative hospital stay e. Postoperative complications, including but not limited to urine leak, 
urinoma, abscess, pseudoaneurysm, ileus, blood transfusion requirements, incisional hernias, wound infection, blood transfusion requirements, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. 
    
9.2 Study Design 
This is a single institution, prospective, randomized, controlled study to evaluate the off -
clamp RAPN technique.  Parallel group design with randomization allocation ratio of 1:1 
to off-clamp RAPN technique (study treatment) and traditional clamped RAPN t echnique 
(control) will be utilized.  Study will be conducted at Washington University and will enroll approximately 80 participants over the course of the study. 
 
9.3 Data Analysis 
 
Data analysis for this study will be descriptive in nature. Demographic and clinical 
characteristics of the sample, as well as local recurrence and post -surgery complications 
will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  Kaplan-Meier product limit method will 
be used to estimate the 2 -year overall and disease -free survival. The  median disease- free 
survival, overall survival and their 95% confidence interval will also be estimated.

Full Scale    Contracted Form  
Grades  Definition  Grades Definition  
Grade  I:  Any deviation from the normal 
postoperative course without the need for 
pharmacological treatment or surgical, 
endoscopic and radiological interventions.    Grade  I:  Same as for Full Scale  
Allowed therapeutic regimens are: drugs as 
antiemetics, antipyretics, analgetics, 
diuretics and electrolytes and 
physiotherapy. This grade also includes 
wound infections opened at the bedside.  
  
Grade  II:  Requiring pharmacological treatment with 
drugs other than such allowed for grade I 
complications.  
Blood transfusions and total parenteral 
nutrition are also included.    Grade  II: Same as for Full Scale  
  
Grade  III:  Requiring surgical, endoscopic or 
radiological intervention    Grade  III:  
  Grades IIIa & IIIb  
Grade III -a:  intervention not under general anesthesia  
Grade III -b:  intervention under general anesthesia  
  
Grade IV:  Life-threatening complication (including 
CNS complications)‡ requiring IC/ICU -
management    Grade IV:  Grades IVa & IVb  
Grade IV -a:  single organ dysfunction (including 
dialysis)  
Grade IV -b:  multi organ dysfunction  
  
Grade V:  Death of a patient    Grade V:  Same as for Full Scale  
Suffix 'd':  If the patients suffers from a complication 
at the time of discharge,   the 
suffix  “d”  (for ‘disability’) is added to the 
respective grade of complication. This label 
indicates the need for a follow -up to fully 
evaluate the complication.        
‡ brain hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, subarrachnoidal bleeding,but excluding transient ischemic attacks (TIA);IC: 
Intermediate care; ICU: Intensive care unit.

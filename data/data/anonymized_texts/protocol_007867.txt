1 SYNOPSIS  
PROTOCOL TITLE:   
A Phase I /IIa, Open -label,  Multiple -cohort, Dose -escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability 
of Gene Therapy with RGX -314 in Subjects with Neovascular AMD (nAMD)  
PROTOCOL NUMBER:  
RGX -314-001 
RATIONALE:  
Excessive vascular endothelial growth factor  (VEGF) plays a key p art in promoting neovascularization 
and edema in neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Counteracting the effects of 
VEGF provides significant therapeutic benefit to subjects suffering from this disorder ( AAO PPP, 2015 ). 
VEGF inhibitors  (anti-VEGF), including ranibizumab (L UCENTIS®, Genentech)  and aflibercept 
(EYLEA®, Regeneron), have been shown to be safe and effective for treating nAMD and have 
demonstrated improvement in vision. However, anti -VEGF therapy is administered frequently via 
intravitreal injection and can be a significant burden to the patients. The heavy treatment burden can lead 
to noncompliance , which can result in vision decline over time  (Cohen et al, 2013; Holekamp et al, 2014) . 
When given as needed according to a fl exible dosing regimen, patients on average receive around 
7 injections of ranibizumab in the 1st year of disease and 4 to 5 injections in the 2nd year ( CATT Research 
Group, 2012; Ho et al, 2014 ). Frequent intravitreal injections are associated with increas ed cumulative 
risk of vision -threatening adverse events (AEs) (Day et al, 2011) .  
RGX -314 is a recombinant adeno -associated virus (AAV) gene therapy vector carrying a coding sequence 
for a soluble anti -VEGF protein. The long -term, stable delivery of this t herapeutic protein following a 
1-time gene therapy treatment for nAMD could potentially reduce the treatment burden of currently 
available therapies while maintaining vision with a favorable benefit :risk profile.  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT :  
Phase I /IIa 
INVESTIGATIONAL PROD UCT, DOSE, AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
RGX -314: AAV 8.CB7.CI.amd42. RBG

2.5 ×  1011 GC/eye (1  × 1012 GC/mL) . 
Single -dose subretinal delivery after pars plana vitrectomy under local anesthesia.  
REFERENCE THERAPY, D OSE, AND MODE OF ADM INISTRATION:  
Ranibizumab ( LUCENTIS , Genentech)  0.5 mg will be administered by intravitreal injection on Visit 1, 
14 days prior to RGX -314 subretinal delivery.  
RESCUE THERAPY, DOSE , AND MODE OF ADMINI STRATION : 
Starting at 4 weeks  post-RGX -314 administration , the subject  may receive intravitreal  ranibizumab rescue 
therapy  at the Investigator’s discretion  in the study eye for disease activity  if 1 or more of the following 
rescue criteria apply:  
 Vision loss of ≥5 letters (per Best Corrected Visual Acuity [BCVA]) associated with 
accumulation of retinal fluid on Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography ( SD-OCT)  
Protocol Number: RGX -314-001

or >30% improvement in   central fluid by SD -OCT.  
2. Non-responsive (subjects will exit the study as early withdrawals): non -response is defined as 
not meeting the criteria above. Additional subjects will continue to be enrolled until up to 
6 subjects (Cohorts 1 to 3) or up to 12 subjects (Cohorts 4 and 5) in each cohort receive a single 
dose of RGX -314. 
At this visit central lab results will be reviewed . Any subjects with the following value s will be withdrawn : 
3. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >2.5 × upper limit of normal 
(ULN)  
4. Total bilirubin >1.5 × ULN unless the subject has a previously known history of Gilbert’s 
syndrome and a fractionated bilirubin that shows conjugated bilirubin <35% of total bilirubin  
5. Prothrombin time (PT) >1.5 × ULN  
6. Hemoglobin <10 g/dL for male subjects and <9 g/dL for female subjects  
7. Platelets <100 × 103/µL 
8. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 
STUDY DESIGN AND MET HODOLOGY:  
In this Phase I /IIa, first -in-human, open -label, multiple -cohort, dose -escalation study, approximately 
42 nAMD subjects will be enrolled into up to 5 dose cohorts of RGX -314. Subjects who meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled and receive a 0.5 mg intravitreal injection of ranibizumab in 
the study eye (Visit 1). At Visit 2 (7 days after ranibiz umab injection), subjects will be evaluated by 
SD-OCT to confirm anatomic response to the initial anti -VEGF activity associated with the ranibizumab 
injection compared with their baseline assessment. Subjects who do not have an anatomic response will 
be wi thdrawn from the study. For withdrawn subjects, anyone who has an AE associated with the 
ranibizumab injections on Visit 1 will be followed until the AE resolves (up to 30 days post -injection). At 
Visit 3 (Week 2), subjects will receive a single dose of RG X-314 administered in an operating room by 
subretinal delivery.  
The sentinel subject in each cohort will have vision of ≤20/63 and ≥20/400 (≤63 and ≥19 ETDRS letters). 
After RGX -314 administration to the sentinel subject, there will be a minimum of 4-week observation 
period for safety. The Internal Safety Committee will review the safety data for this subject and if there 
are no safety concerns, up to 5 (Cohorts 1 to 3) or up to 11 (Cohorts 4 and 5) additional subjects (with 
expanded vision criteria of ≤20/40 and ≥20/400 [≤73 and ≥19  ETDRS letters]) may be treated with RGX -
314, one  per day on consecutive calendar days. If no safety review triggers (SRTs) are observed, then 
4 weeks after the last subject is dosed  (with the exception of Cohort 4 which had an Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) review 4 weeks after the sixth subject was dosed, prior to cohort 
expansion to 12 subjects) , all available safety data will be evaluated by the IDMC. Given that g ene therapy 
studies in nAMD to date ( Campochiaro et al, 2016 ; Constable et al, 2016 ; Rakoczy et al, 2015 ) have had 
events either related to the procedure or occasional in flammation that is mild and transient (resolving in a 
few weeks) , 4 weeks will be adequate to assess these acute events in the sentinel subject . Additionally , if 
any event meets the criteria of a Stopping Rule, dosing of any new subjects will be suspended until a 
complete review of all safety data has been performed by REGENXBIO and the IDMC. At any given 
IDMC meeting, whether called for by an SRT or at the planned IDMC meeting, the IDMC may 
recommend to stop the study, proceed to the next dosing cohort, or  proceed at a lower dose (up to a half 
log).  
Subjects will have 3 visits within the first 4 weeks after treatment with RGX -314 (1 day post -procedure 
and 1 week and 4 weeks post -procedure).  Starting 4 weeks after RGX -314 administration, subjects may 
receive intravitreal ranibizumab rescue therapy at the Investigator’s discretion if they meet predefined 
rescue injection criteria. Immunogenicity to the vector and transgene  product  of RGX -314 will be assessed 
throughout the study.  
Protocol Number: RGX -314-001

USC  S552( B)(4) 
 
 Safety will be the prim ary focus for the initial 24 weeks after RGX -314 administration (primary study 
period). Following completion of the primary study period, subjects will continue to be assessed until 104 
weeks following treatment with RGX -314 (Week 106). At the end of the s tudy, subjects will be invited to 
participate in a long -term follow -up study.  
The safety and tolerability of RGX -314 will be assessed in each dosed subject and will be monitored 
through assessment of ocular and non -ocular AEs and SAEs, chemistry, hematolog y, coagulation, 
urinalysis, immunogenicity, ocular examinations and imaging (BCVA, intraocular pressure, slit lamp 
biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, SD -OCT , fluorescein angiography [FA], fundus 
autofluorescence [FAF] , and color fundus photography [CF P]), and vital signs.   Because of pigmentary 
changes observed in some subjects, s tarting with Protocol Version 10, additional ophthalmic assessments 
will include Optos Ultra -widefield FAF (in addition to Heidelberg  Spectralis  FAF), electror etinography  if 
available , visual field test ( Humphrey Full Field 120 or microperimetry) , and , if applicable, additional SD-
OCT in the area of pigmentary change .  
All Investigators will be preselected based on their previous experience with subretinal delivery in clinical 
practice and will be further trained on the procedure as part of the proposed clinical study. A detailed 
description of the procedures can be foun d in the Administration Manual . 
STATISTICAL METHODS:  
All data will be presented in subject data listings. Categorical variables will be summarized using 
frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
(number of non -missing observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum). 
Graphical displays will be presented as appropriate.  
Safety and efficacy will be reported by dose cohort and may also be reported for all the dose cohorts 
combin ed.  
Sample Size and Power Calculation:  
No formal calculation was performed to determine sample size.

4 INTRODUCTION  
4.1 DISEASE BACKGROUND AND CURRE NT THERAPEUTIC OPTIO NS 
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive degenerative macular disease 
attacking the region of highest visual acuity (VA), the macula. The neovascular or “wet” 
(nAMD) form of the disease is characterized by choroidal neovascularization  (CNV) , 
which is marked by proliferation of blood vessels and cells including those of the retinal 
pigment epithelium (RPE) ( Carmeliet, 2005 ). Ultimately, photoreceptor death and scar 
formation result in a severe loss of central vision and the inability to read, write, recognize 
faces, or drive. Many patients can no longer maintain gainful employment or carry out 
daily activities and consequently report a diminished quality of life ( Mitchell and Bradley, 
2006 ). Preventive therapies have demonstrated little e ffect, and therapeutic strategies have 
focused primarily on treating the neovascular lesion.  
Excessive  vascular endothelial growth factor  (VEGF) plays a key part in promoting 
neovascularization and edema in nAMD. Counteracting the effects of VEGF provides  
significant therapeutic benefit to subjects suffering from this disorder ( AAO PPP, 2015 ). 
Currently available anti -VEGF agents approved for nAMD trea tment, such as ranibizumab  
(LUCENTIS®, Genentech)  or aflibercept (EYLEA®, Regeneron) , have been shown to 
increase Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)  over time  (Schmidt -Erfurth et al, 2014 a), 
but their effects may be limited in duration of effectiveness  (CATT Research Group, 2016 ; 
Rofagha et al, 2013 ).  
While long -term anti-VEGF therap ies may improve vision or slow the progression of 
vision lo ss, none of these treatments prevent neovascularization from recurring ( Brown et 
al, 2006 ; Rofagha et al, 2013 ). Therapy typically must be re -administered to prevent the 
disease from worsening. The need for repeat treatments can incur additional risks  
(ie, endophthalmitis)  and is inconvenient for patients  (LUCENTIS  USPI ). Patients treated 
with ranibizumab as needed were given an average of 13.3  injections over 2 years 
(5.6 injections in year  2). In the Phase III VIEW studies f or aflibercept , in the second year 
of the stud ies (Weeks 52 to 96), patients treated with  aflibercept 2.0  mg as needed received 
4.1 injections on average and patients treated with ranibizumab 0.5 mg as needed received 
4.7 injections on average (Schmidt -Erfurth et al, 2014b ). In real-life conditions, outside 
clinical studies , patients seem to be generally undertreated because of challenges wit h 
compliance ( CATT Research Group, 2012 ; CATT Research Group, 2016 ; Cohen et al, 
2013 ; Holekamp et al, 2014 ). Thus, there is significant need for a long -acting therapeutic . 
An effective gene therapy product with a long duration of action may have a significant 
benefit for patients by substantially reducing the number of injections required to maintain 
a positive treatment  effect, providing the potential for a profound impac t on the treatment 
of this disease.  
Ranibizumab  is a recombinant , humanized immunoglobulin  G1 kappa isotype monoclonal 
antigen -binding fragment (Fab) that binds and inhibit s the biological activity of human 
VEGF -A (LUCENTIS  USPI ). The binding of ranibizumab to VEGF -A prevents the 
interaction of VEGF -A with its receptors VEGFR -1 and VEGFR -2 on the surface of 
endothelial cells. This binding inhibits end othelial cell proliferation and 
neovascularization, as well as vascular leakage, all of which are thought to contribute to

the progression of the nAMD. Ranibizumab has been approved by the United States (US) 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for intravitr eal injection treatment in patients with 
nAMD (initially approved in 2006). From the studies supporting the ranibizumab approval , 
as well as studies and clinical experience since the approval, the activity (efficacy) and 
safety of this anti -VEGF therapy in treating nAMD have been established.  
4.2 BRIEF OVERVIEW OF TH E DEVELOPMENT OF THE  
INVESTIGATIONAL PROD UCT  
Gene therapy is considered an approach that, with a single intervention , could potentially 
lead to long -term anti -VEGF activity. Adeno -associated viruses  (AAV s) are considered 
promising candidates  for ocular gene therapy due to their lack of human pathogenicity, low 
toxicity, and (in particular) their long -term expression while remaining episomal. Adeno -
associated virus serotype 2 ( AAV2 )- and adeno -associa ted virus serotype 8 ( AAV8 )-based 
gene therapy vectors are currently being evaluated in many ocular gene therapy studies 
(www.clinicaltrials.gov) , including: choroideremia  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), achromatopsia  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), Leber’s congenital amaurosis  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), retinitis pigmentosa ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), Stargardt ’s disease  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), X -linked retinoschisis  
(NCT0 2416622 , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), and nAMD ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). In recent studies, AAV was used to deliver a therapeutic 
gene to nAMD patients, including GeMCRIS Protocol #1501 -1380 , in which a subretinal 
injection o f AAV2 was used to deliver sFlt -1, a naturally occurring anti -VEGF Fab protein; 
in GeMCRIS Protocol #0810 -948, an intravitreal injection of AAV2 was used to deliver 
sFLT -01, an engineered sFlt protein fused to an immunoglobulin constant region  and the 
GEM study in which a subretinal injection of equine inf ectious anemia virus was used to 
deliver  endostatin and angiostatin ( Campochiaro et al, 2016 ). 
RGX -314 gene therapy is a recombinant  AAV8 viral vector  contain ing a transgene that 
leads to  the production of a soluble  anti-VEGF Fab protein. RGX -314 is administered via 
a subretinal delivery and could potentially provide long -term treatment with a single 
intervention . The AAV8 vector was selected because st udies have shown that it is more 
efficient than the AAV2 vector in transducing the RPE cells following subretinal injections 
(Vandenberghe et  al, 2011 ).  
 
 
. To maximize 
expression of the protein from the retina pigment epithelium , subretinal delivery of 
RGX -314 directly into the subretinal space will be employed in clinical studies, as 
subretinal delivery has been shown to produce optimal expression in animal models 
(Lebherz et al, 2008 ) and in non human primates (NHP) (Bennett et al, 1999 ; Schmidt -
Erfurth et al, 2014b ; Stieger et al, 2009 ).

4.2.1.1  Primary  Pharmacology  
AAV8 was selected for initial studies based on  its efficiency in transducing retinal cells. 
 
. The 
genes of the heavy and light  chains were separated by an encoded furin cleavage site -F/F2A 
linker to assure equal molar expression of both chains. Initial studies to optimize other 
vector characteristics were performed.

4.2.2 Clinical Data  
This is the first -in-human study of RGX -314. Preliminary safety data from this study that 
support the safety of continued subject dosing may be found in the IB.  
4.3 SUMMARY OF POTENTIAL  RISKS AND BENEFITS  
4.3.1 Observed and Potential Risks  
AAV serotypes (2, 8, and 9) have been studied in several clinical studies such as  
hemophilia  B (Nathwani et al, 2011b ; Nathwani et al, 2014 ), Leber’s  congenital amaurosis  
(Maguire et al, 2008 ), and spinal muscular atrophy  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), and appear to be safe.

USC  S552( B)(4) 
However, direct cl inical data addressing long -term benefits and risks of AAV -mediated 
gene transfer are limited, and the long -term risks remain unknown.   
No studies have been conducted to evaluate the genotoxicity or carcinogenicity of RGX -
314. The persistence of RGX -314 ve ctor DNA was observed in the eye and was not seen 
in any non -ocular tissue  in the NHP studies conducted . The genome of recombinant AAVs 
does not undergo site -specific integration in the host DNA, but remains episomal in the 
nucleus of transduced cells and the risk of insertional mutagenesis in cells of the retina is 
considered low. From a TP perspective, genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies are not 
considered relevant, as with other anti -VEGF Fab s or monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ).  
RGX -314 gene therapy is  a recombinant  AAV8 viral vector  containing a transgene  that 
leads to  the production of an anti -VEGF Fab protein.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
).  
 
 
With gene therapy, there is a possibility that the eye may overexpress 
anti-VEGF Fab, resulting in levels higher than tha t currently given in intravitreal therapy. 
Patients receiving RGX -314 should be monitored for any ocular AEs that could be 
considered indicative of toxicity (and not expected as a result of the surgical procedure). 
Potential signs and symptoms of ocular to xicity are listed in Appendix, Section  14.1. 
As with all therapeutic proteins , there is a potential for an immune response . The subretinal 
space withi n the eye is considered immune privileged ( ie, it is able to tolerate the 
introduction of antigens without eliciting an inflammatory  immune  response ), and AAV 
NAb s have not had effects on subretinally delivered gene therapies ( Bennett et al, 2012 ; 
Constable et al, 2016 ; Kotterman et al, 2015 ). For the proposed clinical study , samples to 
be assayed for AAV8 NAb s will be collected from within the eye prior to RGX -314 
administration to assess  for any correlation with outcomes, but subjects will not be 
excluded based on the presence of AAV8 NAb s at baseline , as these are not expected to 
have a clinically rele vant effect . If a subject were to experience an immune response, 
inflammation may occur. The symptoms of inflammation will be monitored closely in the 
proposed clinical study and treated if necessary ( Appendix,  Section 14.1).

For this study , an injection site away from the macula was selected for gene therapy 
delivery and retinal anatomy including  the site of injection/bleb area is  monitored regularly 
with SD -OCT. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
Since bleb area SD -OCT scans were performed monthly since treatment, these SD -OCTs 
were reviewed by the reading center  consultant .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
For subjects with inferior retina findings, crosshair (radial) SD -OCT scans are being 
collected to review over time. Similar findings to those described for SD -OCT s in the bleb

area were observed.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Additional functional assessments, including Humphrey visual field test or microperimetry 
and electroretinography (ERG), have been obtained in some of these subjects.   To date no 
clear visual function deficit has been observed on any of these assessments, though these 
subjects will be assessed to confirm no significant change over time.   Regarding underlying 
nAMD status and central vision, the majority of these subjects have improved BCVA 
compared to baseline with greatly decreased anti -VEGF intravitreal injection frequency 
compared to treatment burden prior to RGX -314 administration, and no subjects have had 
significant BCVA  decrease.  The lone subject with pigmentary changes in the perimacular 
area (Cohort 5) as of the Month 6 visit has gained +6 letters compared with baseline without 
need for anti -VEGF injections.   
Following subretinal delivery of AAV gene therapy, pigment ary changes in the area of the 
bleb have been noted previously ( Dimopoulos et al, 2018 ; Xue et al, 2018 ; Weleber et al, 
2016 ). This appears as hyperpigmentation of the RPE cells and has been noted to have 
hyper and hypo fluorescence on FA. Additionally, hyperpigmentation inferior to the bleb 
has been described follo wing subretinal delivery of tissue plasminogen activator ( TPA ) 
(Hesse et al , 1999 ). No clinical consequence has been reported in the literature as a res ult 
of these findings.  Background pigmentary changes in the periphery on UWF imaging has 
recently been reported to be highly prevalent in the nAMD population, and the potential 
significance of such peripheral imaging findings is unknown ( Forshaw et al, 2019 ). 
All subjects administred  in RGX -314 in clinical trials will have retinal imaging performed 
at baseline and periodically thereafter including UWF CFP , SD-OCT, FAF, and FA.   Post-
treatment SD -OCTs of the bleb area(s) and any area developing pigmentary changes will 
also be performed.  To assess visual function, BCVA, visual field test (Humphrey Full Field 
120 or microperimetry) and (if available) ERG will  be performed.   
The potential for the vector transgene to spread to unintended recipients from shedding 
(release of vectors that did not infect the target cells and were cleared from the body via 
feces or bodily fluids), mobilization (transgene replicatio n and transfer out of the target 
cell), or germ line transmission (genetic transmission to offspring through semen) is 
considered to be low. Refer to the protocol -specified precautionary measures for use of 
appropriate birth control in sexually active fema le and male subjects from screening 
through 24 weeks after vector administration and for precluding any use in pregnant 
females or in females planning to become pregnant within 24 weeks after administration.

The vector can be handled under BSL -1 conditions  (or RG1).  
RGX -314 will be administered subretinally by a trained retinal surgeon with the subject 
under local anesthesia. The procedure will involve standard 3 -port pars plana vitrectomy 
with a core vitrectomy followed by subretinal delivery. Pars plana vitrectomy is considered 
to be part of usual retina care and is not part of an experimental protocol. It is a routine 
retina l surgery that can usually be performe d safely as an outpatient procedure.  
Vitrectomy -related complications include inflammation or redness, swelling, pain, 
increased or reduced IOP, bleeding, cataract  (not applicable to pseudophakic subjects) , 
retinal tears , retinal detachments , retinal and vitreous  incarceration, vitreous  hemorrhage , 
and e ndophthalmitis . The procedure is also associated with risks for the long -term 
development of open -angle glaucoma due to increased oxygen tension in the eye and 
potential oxidative damage to the trabecular m eshwork. Very rare ly, vitrectomy also 
increases the  risks of developing a  visual field defect, visual loss due to macular toxicity 
of light or dye (if used) or manipulation, and optic neuropathy ( AAO, 2015 -2016 ). The 
vitrectomy performed in this study will not include the use of dyes and will be performed 
in pseudophakic eyes.  
Subretinal delivery is a less common technique performed by vitreoretinal surgeons . Most 
retinal surgeons have experience with the  technique for the delivery of TPA for the 
treatment of submacular hemorrhage. More recently, the techniqu e is being  used in several 
other gene therapy studies for inherited retinal diseases ( Bainbridge et al, 2008 ; Gil-Farina 
et al, 2016 ; Hauswirth et al, 2008 ; MacLaren et al, 2014 ; Maguire et al, 2008 ; and ongoing 
studies noted in Section 4.2) and results previously reported from 2  nAMD programs  
(Campochiaro et al, 2016 ; Constable et al, 2016 ; Rakoczy et al, 2015 ). No serious adverse 
events ( SAE s) related to investigational product were observed in these studies ; mild 
adverse events ( AEs) consistent with vitrectomy were noted, and 1 patient developed a 
macular hole of which the patient was unaware ( Maguire et al, 2008 ). The serious risks 
associated with  subretinal delivery  include  retinal and vitreous hemorrhage, inflammation, 
increases in IOP, retinal tear, macular hole, retinal detachment , or severe endophthalmitis . 
As described above, subretinal delivery of gene therapy and TPA has been associated with 
pigmentary changes in the area of the bleb and/or inferior retina. All Investigators will be 
preselected based on their previous retinal surgery experience in complex retinal 
procedures (such as subretinal delivery) and experience with surgical clinical studies . 
Surgeons will receive further training on the study procedure as part of the proposed 
clinical study . A detailed description of the procedure can be found in the Administration 
Manual.   
A theoretical administration risk to subjects stems from transfer of silicone from the inner 
coating of the syringe into the subject’s eye during the adminis tration procedure ( Melo et 
al, 2019 ). While this risk is considered to be low because of the air -fluid exchange at the 
end of the vi trectomy, low flow rate of injection of RGX -314, and single RGX -314 
administration, investigators should monitor subject s for signs of inflammation or floaters 
and record any change from the subjects ‘ baseline condition as an AE.  
Detailed discussion of the risks of RGX -314 a nd its administration can be found in the IB.

4.3.2 Potential Benefits  
RGX-314 delivers a transgene that leads to the production of  an anti -VEGF Fab protein . 
Anti-VEGFs are currently approved for the treatment of  nAMD. Ranibizumab , aflibercept , 
and mor e recently  brolucizumab  (Brolucizumab Prescribing Information ) have provided 
evidence for the ability  of anti-VEGF s in improving vision and macular edema in patients 
with nAMD. However, these therapies require frequent injections for extended periods, 
often for years .  
The proposed treatment with RGX -314 is a single administration expect ed to provide 
continuous levels of  anti-VEGF activity in the range where established efficacy has been 
seen in ranibizumab models . A long -term duration of efficacy following a single 
intervention will be a significant benefit to patients who currently must undergo monthly 
or otherwise freque nt injections. RGX -314 may offer patients an alternative treatment to 
approved anti -VEGF therapies and may provide a similar benefit but with less need for 
repeated intravitreal injection s.  
4.4 STUDY RATIONALE S 
4.4.1 Rationale for Proposed Doses  
RGX -314 will be adm inistered as a single subretinal delivery to the subretinal space. This 
replicates the route of administration used in the nonclinical studies. Dose scaling from 
animals to humans took into consideration approximate differences in retinal surface area 
and injection volume.  
When selecting a starting human dose, one key consideration was that the ability to 
readmin ister the vector may not be possible due to potential immune responses. Given that 
subsequent administration of a higher dose in an individual sub ject may not be feasible due 
to anatomic and manufacturing constraints, it is necessary to select a starting clinical dose 
that is both safe and carries a reasonable expectation of benefit in this patient population. 
The proposed starting dose in the prese nt study is based on the MED and MTD as 
determined in mouse models of disease and in NHPs, respectively.

USC  S552( B)(4) 
  
In order  to reduc e the risk of toxicity , doses at or below the MTD  will be used;  additional 
risk will be mitigated by the location of administration. Subretinal delivery in this study 
will be targeted to the area superior to the fovea within the vascular arcades, which will 
avoid the macula  with all blebs to remain outside the fovea b y at least 2 disc diameters to 
mitigate any potential risk. As an additional clinical safety assessment, the protocol 
includes SD -OCT imaging of the bleb area to evaluate retinal thickness over time . 
The proposed doses represent an acceptable benefit:risk profile, where the dose is expected 
to be in the therapeutic range (and, therefore, may offer clinical benefit) and potential risks 
are managed through targeted administration  and regular SD-OCT monitoring .

4.4.2 Rationale for use of a Sentinel Subject  
For each dose cohort, a sentinel subject with BCVA of ≤20/63 and ≥20/400 (≤ 63 and 
≥19 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] letters) will be assessed out to 
4 week s post-RGX -314 administration prior to dosing anyone further in the dose cohort.  
The doses chosen in this study are considered safe based on the nonclinical animal data. 
Because this is a first -in-human study to explore safety, a subject with worse vision will be 
treated initially and assessed for safety at that dose before expanding the vision criteria for 
the remainder of the subjects in a given cohort. Given that g ene therapy studies in nAMD 
to date ( Campochiaro et al, 2016 ; Constable et al, 2016 ; Rakoczy et al, 2015 ) have had 
events either related to the procedure o r occasional inflammation that were  mild and 
transient (resolving in a few weeks) , 4 weeks will be adequate to assess these acute events 
in the sentinel subject . Following the sentinel subject evaluation, the remaining  subjects in 
the dose cohort must  have BCVA ≤20/ 40 and ≥20/400 (≤ 73 and ≥ 19 ETDRS letters).

6.2 STUDY DESIGN  
In this Phase I /IIa, first -in-human, open -label, multiple -cohort, dose -escalation study, 
approximately 42 nAMD subjects will be enrolled into up to 5 dose cohorts of RGX -314. 
Subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled a nd receive a 0.5 mg 
intravitreal injection of ranibizumab in the study eye ( Visit 1). At Visit 2  (7 days after 
ranibizumab injection), subjects will be evaluated by SD -OCT to confirm anatomic 
response to the initial anti -VEGF activity associated with the r anibizumab  injection 
compared with their baseline assessment. Subjects who do not have an anatomic response 
will be withdrawn from the study  (response defined in Section 7.1.3 ). For withdrawn 
subjects, anyone who has an AE associated with the ranibizumab injections on Visit 1 will 
be followed until the AE resolves (up to 30 days post -injection). At Visit 3  (Week 2 ), 
subjects will receive a single dose of RGX -314 administered in an operating room by 
subretinal delivery.   
The 1st subject in each cohort (sentinel subject) will have vision of ≤20/ 63 and ≥20/400 
(≤63 and ≥ 19 ETDRS letters). After RGX -314 administration t o the 1st subject, there will 
be a minimum of  4-week observation period for safety. The Internal Safety Committee will 
review the safety data for this subject and if there are no safety concerns, up to  5 (Cohorts 
1 to 3) or up to 11 (Cohorts 4 and 5) additional subjects (with expanded vision criteria of 
≤20/40 and ≥20/400 [≤ 73 and ≥ 19 ETDRS letters]) may be  treated , one  per day , on 
consecutive calendar days.  If no safety review triggers (SRTs) are observed, then 4 weeks 
after the last subject is dosed  (with the exception of Cohort 4 which had an  Independent 
Data Monitoring Committee [ IDMC ] review 4 weeks after the sixth subject was dosed, 
prior to cohort expansion to 12 subjects) , all available safety data will be evaluated by the 
IDMC.  Given that g ene therapy studies in nAMD to date ( Campochiaro et al, 2016 ; 
Constable et al, 2016 ; Rakoczy et al, 2015 ) have had events either related to the procedure 
or occasional inflammation that were  mild and transient (resolving in a few weeks) , 4 
weeks will be  adequate to assess these acute events in the  sentinel subject . Additionally, i f 
any event meets the criteria of a Stopping Rule, dosing of any new subjects will be 
suspended until a complete review of all safety data has been performed by REGENXBIO 
and the IDMC. At any given IDMC meeting, whether called for by a n SRT or at the planned 
IDMC meeting, the IDMC may recommend to stop the study, proceed to the next dosing 
cohort, or proceed at a lower dose (up to a half log).  
Subjects will have 3 visits within the first 4 weeks after treatment with RGX -314 (1 day 
post-procedure and 1 week and 4 weeks post -procedure) . Starting 4 weeks after RGX -314 
administration, subjects may receive intravitreal ranibizumab rescue therapy at the 
Investigator’s discretion if they meet predefined rescue injection criteria  (Section 8.1.2 ). 
Immunogenicity  to the vector and transgene product of RGX -314 will be assessed  
throughout the study.  
Safety will be the primary f ocus for the initial 24 weeks after RGX -314 administration  
(primary study period). Following completion of the primary study period, subjects will 
continue to be assessed until 104 wee ks following treatment with RGX -314 (Week 106) . 
At the end of the study,  subjects will be invited to participate in a long -term follow -up 
study.

USC  S552( B)(4) 
The safety and tolerability of RGX -314 will be assessed in each dosed subject as shown in 
Section 8.4. The safety and tolerability of RGX -314 will be monitored through assessment 
of ocular and non -ocular AEs and SAEs , chemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis, 
immunogenicity, ocular exam inations and imaging (BCVA, IOP, slit lamp biomicroscopy, 
indirect ophthalmoscopy, SD -OCT , FA, Heidelberg Spectralis FAF, and CFP ), and vital 
signs.  Because of pigmentary changes observed in some subjects, s tarting with Protocol 
Version 10, additional opht halmic assessments will include Optos UWF  FAF (in addition 
to Heidelberg Spectralis FAF), ERG  if available , visual field test ( Humphrey Full Field 
120 or microperimetry), and , if applicable, additional SD -OCT in the area of pigmentary 
change . 
All Investigators will be preselected based on their previous experience with subretinal 
delivery  in clinical practice and will be further trained on the procedure as part of the 
proposed clinical study . A detailed description of the procedures can be foun d in the 
Administration Manual.

At the discretion of the Sponsor, additional subjects may be enrolled if a subject(s) does 
not receive a full 250 μ L dose in the subretinal space.  
7.3 WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJEC TS 
Every effort should be made to keep subjects in the study. However, s ubjects are fre e to 
withdraw consent and/or discontinue participation in the study at any time, without 
prejudice to further treatment.  
A subject may be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:  
 Considered non -responsive to ranibizumab (per Section  7.1.3 ) 
 Lost to follow -up 
 Termination of study by REGENXBIO  
 Protocol deviation  
 Noncompliance  with study visits  
 Subject or Investigator  decides to di scontinue the subject’s participation in the 
study  
The term “Early Withdrawal” is used for subjects who dropped out prior to dosing  with 
RGX -314, including those who are considered nonresponsive (per Section 7.1.3 ). An Early 
Termination Visit is not required for these subjects. The term “Early Termination ” is used 
for subjects who exit the study after receiving  a dose of RGX -314. These subjects shoul d 
complete all tests of the Early Termination Visit . (See Table 2:  Schedule of Events After 
End of Year 1 Through Year 2 .) 
At the end of the subject’s  participation, the Investigator will complete the discontinuation 
page of the case report form (CRF) and document the reason(s) for study discontinuation.

8.1 RANIBIZUMAB  
8.1.1 Initial Treatment  in the Study Eye  
All subjects will receive a single intravitreal injection of r anibizumab 0.5 mg on Visit  1 
(14 days prior to RGX -314 delivery ). 
8.1.2 Rescue Therapy  
Starting at 4 weeks post -RGX -314 administration , the subject  may receive intravitreal 
ranibizumab rescue therapy in the study eye  at the Inve stigator’s discretion  for disease 
activity if 1 or more of the following rescue criteria apply:  
 Vision loss of ≥5 letters (per BCVA) associated with accumulation of retinal fluid 
on SD -OCT  
 CNV -related increased, new, or persistent subretinal or intraretina l fluid on 
SD-OCT  
 New ocular hemorrhage  
Injection may be deferred at the Investigator ’s discretion  if 1 of the following sets of 
findings occur:  
 VA is 20/20 or better and CRT  is “normal”  as assessed by SD -OCT  
 VA and SD -OCT are stable after 2 consecutive injections . 
If injections are deferred, they will be resumed if VA or SD -OCT get worse per the criteria 
above . 
With approval from the Sponsor’s Medical Director , the Investigator may recommend 
changing the study eye rescue therapy  from ranibiz umab to aflibercept. Only ranibizumab 
will be provided as part of the study .

10 ADVERSE EVENT HANDLING  AND SAFETY REPORTING  
10.1 DEFINITIONS  
10.1.1  Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug -related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not 
related to the medicinal (investigational) product .  
A suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of expedited reporting, “reasonable possibility” 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. 
Suspected adverse reaction impl ies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse 
reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
Events meeting the definition of an AE include:  
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in fr equency and/or intensity of the condition  
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration 
even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected intera ction  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either the 
investigational product or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be 
reported as an AE/SAE)  
 Abnormal laboratory findings, as defined in Section  10.2. 
“Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. However, the signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae 
resulting from lack o f efficacy will be reported if they fulfill the definition of an AE or 
SAE.  
Events that do not  meet the definition of an AE include:  
 Medical or surgical procedure ( eg, endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE  
 Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur ( eg, social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital)  
 Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen  
 The d isease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
subject’s condition

USC  S552( B)(4) 
10.1.2  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An AE is considered to be a n SAE if, in the view of the Investigator  or Sponsor, it results 
in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death  
 Life-threatening AE  
NOTE: Life -threatening AE or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction is an AE 
or suspected adverse reaction that is considered “ life-threatening ” if, in the view of 
either the Investigator  or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate 
risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 Inpatient h ospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
NOTE: In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained 
(usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for 
observation and/or treatment that  would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during 
hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any 
other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doub t as to whether 
“hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
 Persistent or significant incapacity/disability  
NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functio ns. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma ( eg, sprained ankle) that may 
interfere or prevent everyday lif e functions but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption.  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 All events of possible drug -induce d liver injury with hyperbilirubinemia having the 
following 3 components termed “Hy’s Law” events.  
1. ALT ≥3 × ULN or AST ≥3 × ULN  
2. Total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN  
3. No other reason can be found to explain the changes observed in #1 and 
#2 above.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered serious when, base d upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are ocular 
inflammation resulting in severe vision loss (> 6 lines on ETDRS  chart ).

USC  S552( B)(4) 
10.2 LABORATORY AND OTHER  SAFETY ASSESSMENT 
ABNORMALITIES REPORT ED AS AES AND SAES  
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, chemistry, coagulation, or urinalysis) 
or other safety assessments ( eg, vital sign measurements), including those that worsen from 
baseline  and are thought to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgement 
of the Investigator , are to be recorded as AEs or SAEs.  
However, any clinically significant safety as sessments that are associated with the 
underlying disease, unless judged by the Investigator  to be more severe than expected for 
the subject’s condition, are not to be reported as AEs or SAEs.  
10.3 EVALUATION OF ADVERS E EVENTS/SERIOUS ADV ERSE EVENTS  
10.3.1  Relationshi p to Study Treatment  and/or Study Procedures  
The Investigator  will assess the potential relationship of the AE s to study treatment or 
procedures  using the following definitions:  
 Not Related:  This category applies to an AE that is clearly not related to the 
investigational product/procedure, beyond a reasonable doubt. That is, another 
cause of the event is most plausible; and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence 
is inconsistent with the  onset of the event and the exposure to investigational 
product and/or causal relationship is considered biologically implausible.  
 Possibly Related:  This category applies to an AE that follows a reasonable 
temporal sequence from administration of the inves tigational product and that 
follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected investigational 
product, but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
 Probably Related:  This category applies to an AE that follows a reaso nable 
temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product and that 
follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected investigational 
product and that could not be reasonably explained by the subject’s concurrent 
disease or othe r drugs or chemicals.  
10.3.2  Severity or Intensity Grading of A dverse Event Scoring  
Wherever possible, the severity of all AEs will be graded using the National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE  Version 4.03 ). 
The majori ty of AEs can be graded using the CTCAE criteria; however, if an AE cannot 
be graded using the CTCAE criteria, it should be graded according to the following 
definitions:  
 Mild (Grade 1):  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of 
minor  irritant type causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not 
require therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient .  
Protocol Number: RGX -314-001

PROPRIETARY AND CONFI DENTIAL AND THUS EXE MPTED FROM DISCLOSUR E PURSUANT TO 5 USC  S552( B), ESP. 5 
USC  S552( B)(4) 
 Moderate (Grade 2):  Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to 
the participant and m ay interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by 
simple therapeutic measures; moderate experiences may cause some interference 
with functioning.  
 Severe (Grade 3):  Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and 
generally requi re systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually 
incapacitating.  
 Life-threatening (Grade 4):  Events that place the subject at immediate risk of 
death or are disabling requiring urgent intervention.  
 Death (Grade 5):  Events that result in death.  
The concept of “SAEs” and “Severe Adverse Events” is often confused. Severity is not 
synonymous with seriousness. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity 
(severity) of a specific event ( eg, mild, moderate, or severe); however, the event itself may 
be of relatively minor medical significance. For example , a headache is severe, if it causes 
intense pain. On the other hand, a headache is not usually serious (but may be in case of 
subarachnoid hemorrhage , subdural bleed, even a migraine may t emporally fit “serious” 
criteria), unless it also satisfies the criteria for seriousness as defined in Section  10.1.2 . 
Similarly, a severe rash is not likely to be an SAE. However, mild chest pain may result in 
a day’s hospitalization and thus is an SAE.  
An SAE is based on subject /event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events 
that pose a threat to a subject ’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a 
guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. In other words, an SAE  requires an 
additional reporting process (reported to corporate global drug safety group or 
pharmacovigilance group, r egulatory authorities,  Institutional Review Boards  
[IRBs]/Independent Ethics Committees [ IECs ]). 
All events of ocular inflammation must additionally be graded according to the Ocular 
Inflammation Grading Scales (Appendix, Section 14.2). 
10.4 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS, SERIOUS ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS, 
AND REQUIREMENTS FOR  IMMEDIATE REPORTING  
Any SAE that occurs at any time during the study, including a clinicall y significant 
abnormal laboratory test result that is considered serious, must be reported within 24  hours 
of knowledge of the event to REGENXBIO or its designee. These requirements apply 
equally to all subjects, regardless of the study phase or the subjec t’s treatment assignment 
or dose. The reporting requirement for SAEs is from the time of signing the ICF through 
30 days following the last study visit.  
A death occurring during the study and within 30  days after the last study visit must be 
reported to REGENXBIO or its designee with in 24 hours of knowledge of the death 
whether or not it is considered treatment -related .  
Initial SAE reports must be followed by detailed descriptions. These should include copies 
of hospital case records and other documents when requested. In addition, the Investigator  
Protocol Number: RGX -314-001 
 
 
REGENXBIO  INC.  PAGE  68 OF 86 V10: 10 FEBRUARY  2020  
PROPRIETARY AND CONFI DENTIAL AND THUS EXE MPTED FROM DISCLOSUR E PURSUANT TO 5 USC  S552( B), ESP. 5 
USC  S552( B)(4) 
must notify the IRB/IEC of the SAE occurrence in accordance with the IR B/IEC reporting 
requirements. A  copy of this notification must be provided to REGENXBIO or its 
designee.  
REGENXBIO has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation. 
REGENXBIO will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to saf ety 
reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC, and Investigator s. Investigator safety 
reports are prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions according to local 
regulatory requirements and are forwarded to Investigator s as necessary.  
10.5 PREGNANCY REPORTING  
Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation either to a study subject or to the 
female partner of a male subject must be reported using a clinical study pregnancy form. 
To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy must be reported t o REGENXBIO within 
24 hours  of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy must be followed up to determine 
outcome (including premature termination) and status of mother and child. Pregnancy 
complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must b e reported as an AE or 
SAE. Spontaneous abortions must be reported as an SAE.  
Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy brought to the Investigator ’s attention 
after the subject has completed the study and considered by the Investigator  as possibl y 
related to the investigational product, must be reported to REGENXBIO  within 24 hours 
of knowledge of the event . 
10.6 URGENT SAFETY MEASUR ES 
The regulations governing clinical studies state that REGENXBIO and the Investigator  are 
required to take appropriate Urgent Safety Measures (USMs) to protect subjects against 
any immediate hazards that may affect the safety of subjects, and that the appropriate 
regulatory bodies should be notified according to their respective regulations.  
USMs are procedures that are n ot defined by the protocol, which can be put in place with 
immediate effect without needing to gain prior authorization by the IRB (and regulatory 
authorities, where applicable), in order to protect subjects from any immediate hazard to 
their health and sa fety.  
The reporting period for USMs is from signing the ICF through completion of the last study 
visit. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to notify REGENXBIO or its designee of any 
USMs within 24  hours of occurrence.

12.1 ETHICAL CONDUCT OF T HE STUDY  
The Investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with the 
principles established by the 18th World Medical Association General Assembly 
(Helsink i, 1964) including any subsequent amendments and clarifications to these 
principles, current US FDA regulations, International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and local ethical and regulatory requirements. 
Should a c onflict arise, the Investigator  should follow whichever regulation or guideline 
affords the greater protection to the individual subject.  
12.1.1  Institutional Review Board  
The IRB must be a properly constituted board or committee operating in accordance with 
21 Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) Part 56: Institutional Review Boards and ICH E6: 
Guideline for GCP. This protocol, any protocol amendments, and ICFs must be submitted 
to the IRB for review and must be approved before screening of any subject into the stud y. 
Investigational product will not be shipped to the Investigator  until REGENXBIO or its 
designee has received a copy of the IRB approval letter or certificate of approval from the 
IRB for the protocol, any amendments, and ICFs. Site -specific ICFs must be  approved by 
REGENXBIO prior to IRB submission.  
In addition, all subject recruitment and/or advertising materials and subject instructions, if 
applicable , must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval prior to implementation. 
Approval by REGENXBIO i s required prior to IRB submission of any subject recruitment 
and/or advertising materials and subject instructions, if applicable.  
IRB approval of any protocol amendment must be received before any of the changes 
defined in the protocol amendment are impl emented, except when the protocol amendment 
has been enacted to protect study subjects. In these circumstances, the chair of the IRB 
should be notified immediately and the amendment forwarded to the IRB for review and 
approval.  
12.1.2  Subject Information and Informed Consent  
Informed consent is the process that is initiated prior to the potential subject’s agreement 
to participate in the study and continues throughout the subject’s study participation. It is 
the Investigator’s responsibility to obtain signed written informed consent from each 
potential study subject prior to the performance of any study -related procedure. Written 
informed consent will be obtained only after the nature of the study including potential 
risks have been fully explained to each pot ential subject. The subject  and/or subject’s legal 
guardian(s)  will be given the opportunity to ask any questions during informed consent as 
well as throughout the study, and all of the subject’s questions must be answered to the 
subject’s satisfaction. Th e Investigator must explain to each subject that participation in 
the study is completely voluntary and that the subject can decline participation or withdraw 
from participation at any time. If the subject is unable to provide informed consent, then 
inform ed assent will be obtained and informed consent must be provided by the subject’s 
legal guardian(s).

The process of obtaining and documenting informed consent will comply with 21  CFR 
Part 50: Protection of Human Subjects, ICH GCP guidelines, the Health In surance 
Portability and Accounting Act (HIPAA), and all other applicable regulatory requirements. 
Subjects will be given a copy of the signed ICF and will be provided any new information 
during their participation in the study that may affect their continu ed willingness to 
participate in the study. If the protocol is amended and the ICF is revised, each subject will 
be required to provide written informed consent again using the revised IRB/IEC -approved 
ICF. 
Informed consent will be documented in the subjec t’s study file and in the CRF. The signed 
ICF will remain in each subject’s study file and must be made available to the Study 
Monitor(s) at all times.  
12.2 DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING  
12.2.1  Monitoring and Access to Study Records  
A representative of REGENXBIO and/or its designee will perform routine monitoring and 
auditing of the study to ensure compliance with FDA and ICH GCP guidelines. 
REGENXBIO’s designated representative (the Monitor) will visit the Investigator to verify 
the Investigator’s qualifications,  to inspect the clinical site facilities, and to inspect study 
records, including adherence to regulatory requirements ( ie, IRB /IEC  review and approval 
documents). In addition, the Monitor will be responsible for confirming that the study is 
being conducte d in adherence to the study protocol, performing Source Document 
Verification (SDV), and ensuring the integrity of the data.  
The Monitor will maintain frequent contact with the study site throughout the course of the 
study. The Investigator and all other s ite personnel agree to cooperate fully with the 
Monitor and will work collaboratively with the Monitor to resolve all questions and issues 
identified by the Monitor. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to be present or 
available for consultation d uring these routine monitoring visits.  
The Investigator understands and agrees that regulatory authorities, the IRB, and/or 
REGENXBIO or its designee have the right to access all study -related documents 
(eg, CRFs, source documents, etc) during on -site insp ections and routine monitoring visits 
and will retain this right from the beginning of the study until at least 2  years after the last 
approval of a marketing application or for at least 2  years after the discontinuation of the 
clinical development of the investigational product under study. It is the responsibility of 
the Investigator to guarantee access to these documents and to cooperate with and support 
such inspections and routine monitoring visits.  
12.2.2  Source Documents and Case Report Forms  
It is the Inv estigator’s responsibility to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case 
histories that record all observations and other data related to the study for each subject. 
Case histories include the CRFs and supporting data ( ie, source documents) such as si gned 
and dated ICFs, medical records, laboratory reports, etc. Case histories for each subject 
will document that informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFI DENTIAL AND THUS EXE MPTED FROM DISCLOSUR E PURSUANT TO 5 USC  S552( B), ESP. 5 
USC  S552( B)(4) 
A validated Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system will be used for entry of the data into 
electronic CRFs designed and approved by REGENXBIO. All data entered into the CRF 
must be verifiable; therefore, CRFs will be routinely monitored for accuracy, 
completeness, and clarity and will be cross -checked for consistency with source 
documents . 
12.2.3  Data Quality Assurance  
During routine monitoring visits, the Monitor will perform SDV against CRFs to ensure 
data accuracy, completeness, and clarity, including laboratory reports and other subject 
records with the stipulation that subject confide ntiality will be strictly maintained in 
accordance with local and federal regulations, including HIPAA requirements. Instances 
of missing or uninterruptable data will be resolved in coordination with the Investigator.  
In addition to routine monitoring of t he data by the Monitor, the EDC system will include 
internal quality controls by employing Skip Logics and Edit Checks. Skip Logics are 
programs in the database that restrict entry to particular data fields based on previous 
entered data , thus restricting the entry of irrelevant data. Edit Checks are a set of 
programmed instructions in the database to identify and flag discrepancies in the entered 
data. 
12.2.4  Record Retention  
All study -related documents must be retained for at least 2  years after the last approva l of 
a mark eting application or until at least 2  years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of the clinical development of the investigational product. These 
documents should be retained for a longer period , however, if required by the applicable 
regulatory requirements or by an agreement with REGENXBIO. All study -related 
documents must be stored in a secure limited access facility . 
12.3 INDEPENDENT DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE  
This study will be conducted under the auspices of an IDMC. The membership and  
activities are outlined in the IDMC Charter.  
12.4 INTERNAL SAFETY COMM ITTEE  
The Internal Safety Committee will be comprised of REGENXBIO employees and 
designees and be charged with Sponsor oversight for the safe conduct of the study . 
12.5 FINANCING AND INSURA NCE  
Financing and insurance for this study will be addressed in the Clinical Trial Agreement 
with the study site(s).  
12.6 PROVISION OF STUDY R ESULTS AND INFORMATI ON TO

Where required by applicable regulatory requirements, an Investigator  signatory will be 
identified for the approval of the clinical study report. The Investigator  will be provided 
reasonable access to statistical tables, figures, and relevant reports and will have the 
opportunity to review the complete study results at a REGENXBIO site or other mutually 
agreeable location.  
REGENXBIO will also provide the Investigator  with the full summa ry of the study results. 
The Investigator  is encouraged to share the summary results with the study subjects, as 
appropriate.  The results summary will be posted to clinicaltrials.gov  no later than 
12 months after the last subject’s last visit or sooner if required by legal agreement, local 
law, or regulation. A manuscript will be progressed for publication in the scientific 
literature if the results provide important scientific or medical knowledge and will be 
submitted to a peer -reviewed journal for public ation within 18 months of the last subject’s 
last visit.

14 APPENDICES  
14.1 GUIDE TO SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS O F TOXICITY  
AC = anterior chamber; IOP = intraocular pressure; VA = visual acuity.  
 Acute signs and symptoms of toxicity 
(1-7 days post administration)  Anterior segment: Corneal edema, acute increase of intraocular 
pressure (IOP) (spike), anterior chamber (AC) inflamma tory 
response (flare and cells ), iris neovascularization, episcleritis, 
scleritis, and eye pain.  
Posterior segment: acute r etinal necrosis, retinal detachment, 
retinal breaks, intra -retinal and s ubretinal hemorrhage, retinal 
vein thrombosis, cotton wool spots, chorioretinitis and 
inflammation (vitreous cells and haze), retinal edema, retinal 
vascular permeability changes (leak age and edema), sterile 
endophthalmitis, infectious endophthalmitis, macular hole, 
epiretinal membrane, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, retinal 
arterial occlusion, optic nerve edema, optic nerve infarction,  
and retinal vasculitis.  
Functional: acute visual  loss, acute visual field loss, and 
metamorphopsia.  
Near -term signs and symptoms of 
toxicity (2 -4 weeks post 
administration)  Anterior segment: corneal endothelial insufficiency, corneal 
epithelial changes, increased IOP, and AC inflammatory 
response (flare and cells) . 
Posterior segment: retinal necrosis, retinal detachment, retinal 
breaks, intra -retinal and subretinal hemorrhage, retinal vein 
thrombosis, cotton wool spots, chorioretinitis and inflammation 
(vitreous cells and haze), retinal vascular pe rmeability changes 
(leakage and edema), and retinal atrophic changes . 
Functional: VA decline and visual field defects . 
Long -term signs and symptoms of 
toxicity (months)  Anterior segment : corneal endothelial insufficiency and 
glaucoma . 
Posterior segment: r etinal atrophic changes, retinal vascular 
thinning, retinal thinning, loss of retinal layers, low -grade 
inflammation (chorioretinitis, neuroretinitis), atrophic changes 
in retinal areas, and geographic atrophy . 
Functional: reduced VA, color vision disturba nces, visual field 
defects (relative and absolute scotomas), and afferent pupillary 
defect .

14.2 Ocular Inflammation Grading Scales  
Ocular inflammation will be assessed during slit -lamp biomicroscopy and independent 
ophthalmoscopy and graded using the following scales. The standard practice for slit -lamp 
biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy assessment should be used.

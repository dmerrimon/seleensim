Background  and Rationale : 
Fludrocortisone  is a synthetic  adrenocortical  steroid  that mimics  the endogenous  
activity  of aldosterone,  resulting  in an enhanced  reabsorption  of sodium  ions in the distal  
tubule  of the kidney  and resultant  increased  extracellular  fluid  volume.   The goal  of 
fludrocortisone  therapy  is to increase  blood  pressure  by increased  extracellular  volume  and 
potential  vasoconstrictive  activity.   Hydrocortisone,  another  steroid  studied  in conjunction  with  
fludrocortisone  in septic  shock  patients,  displays  both  mineralocorticoid  and glucocorticoid  
activity,  unlike  fludrocortisone  which  has all mineralocorticoid  activity.   In septic  shock  patients  
that present  with  a potential  adrenal  insufficiency  due to impaired  glucocorticoid  and 
vasopressin  production,  it is not clear  whether  treatment  with  hydrocortisone  alone  or in 
combination  with  fludrocortisone  provides  any difference  in mortality  and morbidity.    
 In general,  low dose,  physiologic  dosed  steroid  use has consistently  shown  to reduce  
vasopressor  requirements,  but mortality  benefit  remains  controversial  despite  multiple  
randomized,  controlled  trials  (RCTs).   Recent  meta-analyses  have  concluded  that uncorrected  
data  do not demonstrate  mortality  benefit1.  Of the main  RCTs  conducted  in the past  20 years,  
there  are two main  differences  between  those  that find mortality  benefit  with  steroid  use 
(APROCCHSS  and Ger-Inf-05)  and those  that do not (CORTICUS,  HYPRESS,  and now  ADRENAL).   
The first difference  is the use of fludrocortisone  in combination  with  the standard  dose  of 
hydrocortisone  200 mg intravenously  (IV) daily.   The second  difference  is the focus  on patients  
with  septic  shock  who  did not improve  after  initial  resuscitation  and were  requiring  higher  
baseline  doses  of vasopressors.   The trials  finding  mortality  benefit  enrolled  sicker  patients  at 
baseline  than  the trials  that did not find mortality  benefit,  which  was identified  through  a 
variety  of severity  scores  (APACHE,  SAPSII,  and SOFA)  and baseline  mean  vasopressor  doses2,3.  
For example,  baseline  SOFA  scores  were  on average  12 in the treatment  arm of the APROCCHSS  
trial versus  10.6  in the CORTICUS  trial3,4.  In addition,  mean  norepinephrine  doses  at 
randomization  in the ADRENAL  trial were  30 mcg/min,  whereas  the mean  norepinephrine  dose  
at randomization  in the APROCCHSS  trial was 1 mcg/kg/min  (70 mcg/min  in a 70 kg patient)3,5. 
 The theory  for use of fludrocortisone  centers  around  data  that suggests  40-65%  of 
critically  ill patients  have  high  plasma  renin  activity  and low plasma  aldosterone  
concentrations2.  Moreover,  experimental  sepsis  studies  in murine  models  have  suggested  that 
a marked  NF-kB  mediated  down-regulation  of mineralocorticoid  receptors  occurs  during  the

  Version: 10/19/18 shock  process.   Administration  of aldosterone  in mice  resulted  in improved  response  to 
phenylephrine6.  Based  on the RCTs  performed  in human  subjects,  however,  it is controversial  
whether  addition  of fludrocortisone  provides  any true  benefit  in refractory  septic  shock  
patients.   Moreover,  to date  there  has not been  a trial,  whether  retrospective  or prospective,  
that has directly  compared  the use of hydrocortisone  alone  versus  the combination  of 
hydrocortisone  and fludrocortisone.   Because  of this lack of data,  we will be investigating  the 
use of hydrocortisone  alone  versus  the combination  in critically  ill septic  shock  patients  
admitted  to the medical  intensive  care  unit.   Currently,  both  are considered  standard  of care  
both  within  and outside  of the University  of Tennessee  Medical  Center  Knoxville.  
 
Objective:   To determine  if the use of hydrocortisone  plus fludrocortisone  is associated  with  a 
faster  resolution  of shock  (defined  as 24 hours  vasopressor  free)  when  compared  to the use of 
hydrocortisone  alone  in medical,  critically  ill septic  shock  patients  i 
 
Study  Design  and Methods:  
This study  is a single-center,  prospective,  open-label,  randomized  trial which  will evaluate  adult  
patients  admitted  with  septic  shock  to the medical  critical  care  unit (MCC).  
 Inclusion  Criteria:    
 Age ≥ 18

(hydrocortisone)  in addition  to pressors  for septic  shock  management  during  
their  ICU stay 
 Fludrocortisone  administered  within  24 hours  after  initiation  of hydrocortisone  if 
in combination  therapy  group  
 Exclusion  Criteria:  
 Use of fludrocortisone  and/or  hydrocortisone  for any reason  other  than  septic  
shock  management  during  ICU stay 
 Fludrocortisone/hydrocortisone  initiated  by any service  other  than  critical  care  
medicine

 Patients  not appropriate  for study  inclusion  as determined  by provider  discretion   
 Patients  receiving  steroid  therapy  not in accordance  with  assigned  group  per 
location  (MCC1  or MCC2)   
 Patients  re-admitted  to the MCC  during  the same  admission  and restarted  on 
vasopressor  therapy  will be noted  during  data  collection  and only  the initial  
admission  will be included  for analysis   
 Any patient  receiving  greater  than  one dose  of hydrocortisone  100 mg 
 Physical  or medical  contraindication  to receiving  PO or PER FT (per feeding  tube)

  Version: 10/19/18 Protocol:  
All patients  admitted  to the medical  critical  care  unit side 1 (MCC1)  or side 2 (MCC2)  will be 
provided  a “Notice  of Research.”   At any time,  refusal  or withdrawal  from  the study  can be 
requested  by the patient,  patient  advocate,  or provider.    
 
Patients  that meet  inclusion  criteria  for the study  will receive  either  hydrocortisone  50 mg IV 
Q6h  alone  or a combination  of hydrocortisone  50 mg IV Q6h  plus fludrocortisone  50 mcg 
PO/PER  FT daily.   Fludrocortisone  must  be initiated  and administered  within  24 hours  after  the 
first administered  dose  of hydrocortisone.   Because  fludrocortisone  is only  available  as a 100 
mcg tablet,  the nurse  at the bedside  will split  the tablet  into two as to provide  a 50 mcg dose.   
This is standard  of practice  currently  when  fludrocortisone  is utilized  in our institution.   
 
Steroid  therapy  assignments  will be randomized  based  on patient  location.   For three  
consecutive  months  starting  in October  2018,  all patients  in MCC1  will receive  hydrocortisone  
alone  and all patients  admitted  to MCC2  will receive  hydrocortisone  plus fludrocortisone.   
Then,  in the following  three  consecutive  months,  this will be flipped  and MCC1  will receive  
hydrocortisone  plus fludrocortisone  while  MCC2  will receive  hydrocortisone  alone.   This change  
in group  assignments  will occur  to account  for the difference  in number  of beds  between  MCC1  
and MCC2,  and to minimize  the potential  differences  in patient  acuity  by location.  
 
Initiation  of hydrocortisone  for inclusion  in the study  will be determined  solely  by provider  
discretion  as the standard  of care  for septic  shock  patients.   Once  hydrocortisone  is initiated,  
fludrocortisone  will be initiated  within  24 hours  for patients  on the qualifying  side of the unit,  
unless  any of the previously  stated  exclusion  criteria  are present.   Because  these  interventions  
are currently  utilized  and considered  standard  of care  in the MCC,  data  collection  will be 
performed  retrospectively  by generating  a list of patients  in the MCC  receiving  hydrocortisone  
therapy.    
 
While  each  included  patient’s  data  will be recorded  retrospectively  after  randomization,  we do 
believe  that it is necessary  to perform  this study  in a prospective  manner  rather  than  fully  
retrospective.   It is not feasible  to perform  this study  retrospectively  as we would  not be able  to 
ensure  adequate  and equal  numbers  in each  group  within  the medical  critical  care  unit,  
especially  considering  how  medical  critical  care  patients  are placed  in other  intensive  care  units  
within  our institution  based  on bed availability.   Unequal  groups  would  unduly  bias the results  
and make  the analysis  less meaningful  in terms  of contributing  to the current  body  of evidence.  
 
Any medication  events,  including  adverse  drug  reactions  or medication  errors,  will be routinely  
reported  throughout  the study  to the UTMC  Safety  Intelligence  system.   Routine  reports  of 
events  related  to the study  will be reviewed  weekly  by our medication  safety  office  if necessary.   
Data  will be collected  continuously  throughout  the study  duration  and investigators  will review  
the data  for any concerning  safety  or efficacy  differences  between  the treatment  groups.   Upon  
regular  screening  for adverse  drug  events,  if any are detected,  they  will be not only  be reported  
to the Safety  Intelligence  system  but will also be reported  for review  by the IRB.

  Version: 10/19/18 Per the FDA guidance  for clinical  investigators  regarding  the need  for an investigational  new  
drug  (IND)  application  in human  research  studies,   investigations  are exempt  if the drug  is 
lawfully  marketed  in the U.S.,  the investigation  is not intended  to support  a new  indication  or 
change  the labeling  of the drug,  the investigation  will not support  a change  in advertising  for 
the drug,  and the route  of administration,  dose,  or any other  factor  of the investigation  will not 
increase  the risk associated  with  the drug7.  Our study,  since  we are not changing  standard  of 
care  and are using  accepted,  studied  doses  of hydrocortisone  and fludrocortisone,  meet  these  
criteria  for exemption  from  IND application.

Statistical  Analysis:    
 
Statistical  Power  
IRB NUMBER: 4421
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 10/27/2018
  Version: 10/19/18 In order  to achieve  adequate  statistical  power  for the proposed  prospective  trial,  an a priori  
sample  size calculation  was completed  based  on an evidence-based  measure  of effect  size from  
the APROCCHSS  and CORTICUS  trials3,4. The evidence-based  difference  between  the treatment  
groups  was 24 hours  (Group  1 M = 96, SD = 36; Group  2 M = 72, SD = 36), leading  to a Cohen’s  d 
effect  size of 0.67.  With  a two-tailed  hypothesis,  an effect  size of d = 0.67,  an alpha  value  of 
0.05,  and equal  allocation  to treatment  groups  (1:1),  39 participants  would  be needed  for each  
treatment  group.  This means  the total  sample  size will be n = 78 in order  to achieve  adequate  
statistical  power  for the trial.   
 
Statistical  methods  
Frequency  and percentage  statistics  will be used  to analyze  categorical  demographic,  predictor,  
confounding,  and outcome  variables  of interest  for the sample.  Descriptive  statistics  will be 
used  to describe  the sample  characteristics  associated  with  continuous  variables.  The 
assumption  of normality  of continuous  distributions  will be assessed  using  skewness  and 
kurtosis  statistics.  If either  statistic  is above  an absolute  value  of 2.0, then  the distribution  will 
be assumed  to be non-normal.  Homogeneity  of variance  between  independent  groups  will be 
tested  using  Levene’s  Test  for Equality  of Variances.  When  both  statistical  assumptions  are met,  
independent  samples  t-tests  will be used  to compare  the treatment  groups  on continuous  
outcomes.  Means  and standard  deviations  will be reported  and interpreted  for these  analyses.  
Mann-Whitney  U tests  will be used  for comparisons  when  statistical  assumptions  are violated.  
Medians  and interquartile  ranges  will be presented  and analyzed  for non-parametric  
comparisons.  Chi-square  tests  will be used  to test for significant  associations  between  the 
treatment  groups  and categorical  outcomes.  Relative  risk with  95%  confidence  intervals  will be 
reported  for significant  categorical  associations.  Multiple  regression  analysis  will be performed  
with  time  to resolution  of shock  as the outcome.  Linearity,  normality,  homoscedasticity,  
multicollinearity,  and autocorrelation  assumptions  for the regression  analysis  will be 
performed.  Unstandardized  beta  coefficients,  standard  errors  of the coefficients,  and 
standardized  beta  coefficients  will be reported  and interpreted,  along  with  the change  in 
shared  variance  (R2) and respective  F-tests.  All analyses  will be conducted  using  SPSS  Version  
22 (Armonk,  NY: IBM Corporation)  and statistical  significance  will be assumed  at an alpha  value  
of 0.05.  
 
A priori  subanalysis  will be performed  on the following  subset  of patients:  documented  history  
of heart  failure  and documented  chronic  kidney  disease  stage  III and IV requiring  renal  
replacement  therapy  at baseline.  
 
Critical  Analysis/Limitations:  
Limitations  of this study  will include  the open-label  design  without  blinding  and placebo  
controls.   Also,  as data  collection  will be retrospective  in nature,  we will be relying  on nursing  
documentation  for timing  of vasopressor  initiation  and discontinuation  for our primary  
outcome.   This could  introduce  documentation  bias,  but it is important  to point  out that our 
critical  care  nursing  staff  document  pressor  requirements  hourly.   Also,  to note,  previous  trials  
have  utilized  fludrocortisone  50 mcg doses.   Currently,  the only  commercially  available  
fludrocortisone  product  in the United  States  is a 100 mcg tablet.   In order  to comply  with  the 
IRB NUMBER: 4421
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 10/27/2018
  Version: 10/19/18 previously  studied  dose  and the current  guideline  recommended  therapy,  we will be utilizing  
fludrocortisone  50 mcg in our study.   This will be achieved  by splitting  the available  100 mcg 
tablet  in half.   Education  will be provided  to all providers,  pharmacists,  and nursing  involved  in 
the project  about  the correct  dose  for fludrocortisone  and the appropriate  way to order  the 
dose.

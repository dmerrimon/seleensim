Precision BioSciences, I nc. 
Name of investigational product: PBCAR20A  allogeneic anti -CD20 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells  
Name of active ingredient: PBCAR20A allogeneic anti -CD20 CAR T cells  
Title of study:  
A Phase 1/2a, Open -label, Dose- escalation, Dose-expansion, Parallel Assignment Study to Evaluate 
the Safety and Clinical Activity of PBCAR20A in Subjects with Relapsed/Refractory (r/r) Non-
Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) or r/r Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Small Lymphocytic 
Lymphoma (SLL)  
Study centers: Approximately 10-15 study sites in the United States.  
Objectives:  
Primary:  
Phase 1  
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PBCAR20A in subject s with r/r cluster of differentiation 
(CD) 20 -positive (CD20+) NHL including r/r CD20+ CLL/SLL and find an appropriate dose to 
optimize safety and efficacy.  
Phase 2a  
Evaluate initial efficacy and safety  of PB CAR20A in subjects with CD20+ NHL, specific to the 
population described by the inclusion/exclusion criteria  
 
Secondary:  
Phase 1  
To evaluate the clinical activity of PBCAR20A in subject s with r/r CD20+ NHL including r/r CD20+ 
CLL/SLL.  
Phase 2 a 
To characterize the pharmacologic properties and evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical benefit 
of PBCAR20A treatment regimens in subjects with CD20+ r/r NHL  and to generate hypotheses for 
studies to definitively demonstrate efficacy.  
Criteria for evaluation: 
Safety: 
• Identification of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on the incidence of dose- limiting 
toxicities (DLTs)  
Clinical activity:  
 
• Objective response rate (ORR =CR+PR) :  
− NHL: Lugano 2016 criteria  
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021)  
6 − CLL/SLL: International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocyt ic Leukemia  2018 
guidelines 
• Duration of Response (DOR) – defined as the duration (days) from first response to 
disease progression 
• Progression- free survival (PFS)  
− Defined as the duration (days) from Day 0 to disease progression or death 
• Incidence of AESI, SAEs, and DLTs related to the investigational product 
Methodology: 
This is a Phase 1/2a, nonrandomized, open-label, dose escalation , and dose -expansion study to evaluate 
the safety and clinical activity of PBCAR20A in adult study subject s with r/r  CD20+ NHL, including 
r/r CD20+  CLL/SLL, and to identify a treatment regimen to optimize  clinical efficacy while 
maintaining a favorable safety profile.  The Phase 1 portion of the study will enroll and treat all subjects  as one cohort.  
Three treatment arms are incorporated into Phase 2a to evaluate the effects of alternative dosing 
regimens in specific NHL subpopulations . Evaluation criteria will include PBCAR20A cell expansion 
and persistence as well as clinical activity and safety profile.  
All subjects will receive assigned lymphodepletion and PBCAR20A  dose. Please refer to the Pharmacy 
Manual for the specific lymphode pletion regimen as it may be modified if satisfactory CAR T -cell 
expansion is not observed; lymphodepletion status will be discussed between the Sponsor Medical 
Monitor, Principal Investigators, and contract research organization Medical Monitor. 
On Day 0 of the Treatment Period, all subjects will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of 
PBCAR20A. A fter the DLT evaluation has been completed , subjec ts may be considered for 
retreatment if  there is evidence of clinically meaningful tumor response to in itial dose of PBCAR20A 
followed by documented either a disease progression  or residual disease at subsequent visit ; the 
criteria and procedures for retr eatment are described in the protocol.  
Phase  1 (dose escalation ): 
In Phase 1, up to 3 escalating dose l evels will be enrolled and treated sequentially, with the possibility 
of a single de -escalation dose. Within each dose level , up to 6 subjects will be treated with PBCAR20A 
using a standard 3 + 3 design. The starting dose of PBCAR20A will be 1 × 10
6 CAR T cells/kg body 
weight. Subjects in subsequent dose levels will be treated with escalating doses up to a flat dose of 
480 × 106 CAR T cells. If no MTD is reached additional dose levels may be explored.  
The first treated subject  in each dose level  (including the dose de- escalation level , i.e., Dose - 1) will be 
observed for 14 days for safety before any subsequent subject receives any study treatment to provide 
an adequate safety monitoring window. Once  the first subject in each dose level has completed Day 14 
of dosing with no DLTs , any subsequent subjects can be enrolled without delays into that dose level.  
A DLT is defi ned as any treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) that meets the criteria specified . If 
a DLT is observed in ≤1 of 3 subjects at a given dose level, up to 3 additional subjects (for a total of up 
to 6 subjects) may be enrolled and treated at that dose level. When 3 additional subjects are adde d to 
the dose group, the dose will be increased to the next dose level if ≤1 of 6 subjects experience a DLT. 
If ≥2 of the 3 to 6 subjects in a dose group experience DLTs, the MTD has been exceeded, and up to 3 
additio nal subjects (for a total of 6) will be  treated at the previous (lower) dose level.  
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021)  
7 Dose escalation may proceed once safety of the current dose level has been established, which is 
dependent upon the last subject enrolled in the current dose level completing the 28 -day DLT 
evaluation period. 
The MTD in this study is defined as the highest dose at which ≤1 of 6 study subjects experiences a 
DLT.  If the MTD is not exceeded, the sponsor will choose the recommended P hase 2 a dose based on 
observations of clinical efficacy, safety, and/or cell kinetics.  
The investigators, medical monitor, and sponsor, designated as the Safety Review Committee (SRC ), 
will monitor and convene to review safety data, including any delayed toxicities caused by 
PBCAR20A, at regular intervals to discuss any unexpected signif icant toxicities and to determine 
whether dose escalation is appropriate.  
After the conclusion of Phase 1, the SRC will convene to determine whether Phase 2a of the study can 
proceed. 
If DLTs are found to occur predominantly in one subtype of NHL  subjects (i.e., those with indolent 
lymphoma, including follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic 
lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma or aggressive lymphoma, such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma, PMBCL, Burkitt lymphoma, and other high grade T cell lymphomas), the possibility of 
separating the cohorts for dose escalation may be explored. 
For characterization of the pharmacology, safety profile, and clinical benefit profile, up to 18 subje cts 
total may be enrolled in any given dose level for which safety has been established (i.e., ≤1 of 
6 subjects experiences a DLT). These additional subjects (any subjects after subject 6) will not be 
considered for determination of the MTD and can be enrolled without delays into that dose level. Additionally, these subjects may receive modified lymphodepletion regimens as described in the 
Pharmacy M anual  to evaluate regimens which may increase anti-tumor effect and improve 
PBCAR20A cellular kinetics.  
All s ubjects are monitored for DLTs and AEs during the Treatment Period through Day  28.and will 
continue to be monitored for safety after Day 28 until death, disease progression, stem cell transplant, 
withdrawal of consent, or Day 360, whichever occurs first.  
 
Phase 2a  (dose expansion ):  
Upon selection  of the  recommended P hase 2 a dose (RP2D) and preferred lymphodepletion regimen, 
specific populations (defined by inclusion/ exclusion criteria for Arms A, B and C in the full protocol) 
will be enrolled to characterize clinical efficacy, safety, and pharmacology in that 
population. 
Long -term follow -up study:  
Study subjects who receive a dose of PBCAR20A will be followed in a separate long term follow  up 
(LTFU) study after exiting this st udy (due to either discontinuation or completion). The LTFU study 
procedures wi ll be described in a separate protocol.  
Number of subject s (planned):  
Phase 1 (dose escalation): Approximately 9 to 30 evaluable study subjects are planned to be enrolled. 
Evaluable study subjects for the primary variable assessment of safety and tolerabi lity, related to the 
incidence of DLTs, are defined as those who either complete their treatment period through Day 28 or 
experience a DLT. Non -evaluable study sub jects will be replaced.  
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021)  
8 Phase 2a (dose expansion ): Approximately up to 20 subjects are planne d to be enrolled in any active  
Phase 2a arm. An y arm may be discontinued if evidence of futility (e.g., unexpectedly low ORR) is 
observed. A realistic expectation for enrollment is approximately 40 subjects.  
 
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion:

(excisional when possible). If a subject  never had a complete response (CR) du ring prior lines of 
therapy, a sample from the most recent biopsy is acceptable.  
2. Measurable or detectable disease (positron emission tomography [PET] -positive) with evidence of 
disease progression after most -recent therapy according to the Lugano classification. 
3. Primary refractory disease or r/r disease after treatment with  2 prior regimens , unless per standard 
of care treatment guidance (e.g., National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN]) no second 
line therapy of known benefit exists. Subjects including but not limited to those with the  following 
types of lymphoma and have received the associated standard therapies are eligible :  
a. Primary mediastinal B -cell lymphoma (PMBCL)/follicular lymphoma (FL) including 
Grade 3B or transformed FL/high -grade B- cell lymp homa/diffuse large B -cell lymphoma

Version 5.0 (10FEB2021)  
12 • Treatment period: Days 0 to 28  
• Follow-up: up to Day 360 
Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration:  
None.  
Statistical methods:  
For Phase 1, dose escalation of PBCAR20A will follow a standard 3 + 3 design with sequential groups 
of 3 study subjects treated with incrementally higher doses of PBCA R20A until a DLT is observed and 
the MTD is established.  
For Phase 2a, up to 20 subjects will be enrolled into any Arm for dose expansion and preliminary 
evaluation of efficacy  at the RP2D  for a total of up to 60  subjects.  The data collected from subjects 
enrol led in the dose expansion will be used to confirm safety, explore potential biomarkers, and 
evaluate preliminary efficacy  of PBCAR20A.  Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the 
efficacy, safety, and biomarker endpoints.

24 1. INTRODUCTION 
PBCAR20A is an allogeneic antihuman-cluster of differentiation (CD) 20 chimeric antigen 
receptor (CAR) T -cell product derived from qualified donor T cells that have been genetically 
edited to remove the expression of the endogenous T-cell receptor (TCR). Insertion and 
expression of the anti-CD20 CAR provides the ability to specifically target and bind 
CD20 -positive (CD20+) cells, and the removal of the TCR significantly reduces the possibility of 
developing graft- versus -host disease (GvHD) when it is administered to human leukocyte 
antigen (HLA)- mismatched subjects . PBCAR20A is being developed as an off-the- shelf 
treatment for certain B -cell malignancies.  
1.1. Study rationale  
PBCAR20A is a Phase 1/2a, first- in-human study of PBCAR20A designed to evaluate the safety 
and clinical activity and opti mize the treatment regimen of PBCAR20A in adult study subject s 
with relapsed or refractory (r/r) B -cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia (CLL), or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). As described in the following sections, 
PBCAR20A offers potential therapeutic benefits compared with autologous CAR T- cell 
treatment for certain blood cancers.  
1.2. Background  
1.2.1. Drug development  
During the past 10 years, advances in molecular and cellular biology have led to the creation of genetically modified T cells in which a CAR is inserted and stably expressed in a T lymphocyte. CAR T cells designed to target CD19, an antigen present on B lymphocytes in all stages of 
development except f or terminally differentiated plasma cells, have been used to treat subj ects 
with CD19
+ tumors. Autologous CAR T- cell therapies have progressed into clinical trials, with 
recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah ™) to treat 
subjects  with r/r B -cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B -ALL) up  to 25 years of age (August 
2017) and adult subjects  with r/r large B -cell lymphoma (May 2018). Axicabtagene ciloleucel 
(Yescarta ™) has also been approved to treat r/r large B -cell lymphoma (October 2017). A 
Phase 1/2a study evaluating the safety and clinical activity of PBCAR0191, an allogeneic 
antiCD19 CAR T -cell therapy, in adults with r/r B -ALL and r/r NHL is currently ongoing 
(Investigational New Drug [IND] 18396). 
There are drawbacks to autologous CAR T- cell therapy. First, it can be difficult to obta in enough 
quality T cells from some subjects  with cancer to produce a therapeutic product, particularly 
from subjects  who have fai led several previous lines of treatment. Second, subjects  need to 
undergo apheresis and then wait several weeks while their autologous drug product is being manufactured. Bridging chemotherapy is often required during this waiting period, which can result in chemotherapy- related toxicities that can render the patient too sick to receive their CAR 
T-cell therapy. In addition, autologous CAR T-cell therapies are inherently heterogeneous. Using qualified donor lymphocytes as the starting material to generate C AR T cells can mitigate these 
problems.  
Approximately half of subjects  with relapsed leukemia after anti -CD19 therapy lose CD19 
expression and require alternative treatments ( Maloney, 2012; Sotillo et al, 2015; Gardner et al, 
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021)  
25 2016). CD20 is an attractive target because it is expressed in over 90% of B-cell lymphomas, 
does not internalize upon binding, and is stable on the cell s urface ( Press et al, 1989; Reff et al, 
1994). The CD20 antigen is another well- established target for B -cell malignancy treatments , as 
demonstrated by extensive clinical trials with rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody. Thus, CAR T-cell therapy directed agains t CD20 provides an alternative option for subjects  who relapse 
from anti -CD19 therapy.  
PBCAR20A is produced in bulk from T cells derived from qualified donors to generate hundreds of vials of drug product that is stored frozen and available off- the-shelf.  Therefore, subjects will 
not need to undergo apheresis and bridging chemotherapy while they wait for an autologous 
CAR T -cell product to be manufactured and shipped to the treatment center for administration. 
In addition, the source of the starting material for PBCAR20A production, i.e., T cells from qualified donors that meet prespecified criteria, allows for better control of the CAR T- cell 
manufacturing process and production of a more homogenous and better-defined drug product. 
However, allogeneic T cells can lead to the development of GvHD when they are infused into 
HLA- mismatched recipi ents. In PBCAR20A, gene-editing technology is used in donor T cells to 
prevent the expression of the native TCR; thus, reducing or eliminating the likelihood of GvHD 
resulting from administration of the allogeneic CAR T -cell product. Transduction leads to 
insertion and expression of the CD20-targeting CAR transgene, thereby redirecting the 
specificity of the T  cells with the goal of creating off-the- shelf CAR T -cell products that can be 
consistently manufactured and safely administered to any patient when needed.  
In this study, the allogeneic CAR T-cell product, PBCAR20A, will be administered to adult study subject s with r/r CD20
+ NHL including r/r CD20+ CLL/SLL.  
1.2.2. Place in  treatment  – Phase 1  
Hematologic B -cell malignancies comprise a large, heterogeneous gro up of lymphoproliferative 
disorders that range from the slow-growing, indolent NHLs (e.g., follicular lymphoma [FL], SLL, and CLL) to more aggressive forms (e.g., diffuse large B -cell lymphoma [DLBCL] and 
B-ALL) ( Boffetta, 2011; Hallek, 2015). B -cell disor ders represent more than 85% of all NHL 
cases ( Howlader et al, 2016) and 75% to 80% of all types of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) 
(Chiaretti et al, 2014 ). The NHL in cidence rates are higher among the elderly population than in 
the younger population, with diagnoses of NHL most common among subjects  65 to 74 years of 
age ( Howlader et al, 2016 ). The most common subtype of NHL is DLBCL, which accounts for 
30% to 40% of a ll NHL cases ( Al-Hamadani et al, 2015 ). FL is the second most common form 
of NHL, accounting for about 20% to 35% of all NHL cases; approximately 15% of FL cases are Grade 3B ( Shustik et al, 2011). CLL/SLL is the third most commonly diagnosed and accounts 
for approximately 25% to 30% of leukemias in the United States; CLL is the most common type 
of leukemia in adults >19 years of age and accounts for about 35% to 40% of cases ( Seigel et al, 
2019).  
Typically, front- line anthracycline -based immunochemotherapy with rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R- CHOP) or similar regimens are 
used to treat DLBCL, FL Grade 3B, and Stage III to V mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). While 
R-CHOP is expected to provide benefits to more than 50% of newly diagnosed subjects, at least 
one-third will be refractory to ﬁrst -line chemotherapy, achieve only partial remission, or relapse 
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021)  
26 after achieving complete remission ( Habermann et al, 2006; Sud and Friedberg, 2008; Fakhri and 
Kahl, 2017; Casulo et al, 2 015).  
Management of B -cell lymphomas after failure of immunochemotherapy is challenging. While 
salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplant is an option, it is 
associated with signiﬁcant toxicities that would preclude many subjects  with comorbidities or 
advanced age. Thus, the prognosis of r/r B- cell lymp homa as a group remains poor ( Casulo et al, 
2015; Rovira et al, 2015; Van Den Neste et al, 2016 ; Vose, 2017). In adult subjects  with r/r large 
B-cell lymphoma, axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta ™) showed an objective response rate (ORR) 
of 72% and a median duration of response (DoR) of 9.2 months and tisagenlecleucel 
(Kymriah ™) had an ORR of 50% and the DoR was not reached, indicating that CAR T- cell 
therapy may significantly imp rove the prognosis for these subjects .  
CLL is the most common type of leukemia in adults; the median age of diagnosis is 70 years and 
the 5 -year survival rate is 84% ( Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results [SEER]- Medicare 
Linked Database, 2019). CLL is a biologically heterogeneous disease, and morphologic, 
immunologic, cytogenet ic, biochemical, and molecular genetic characterization of leukemia 
lymphoblasts are needed to establish the diagnosis and classify the subtypes. Subjects  with CLL 
have had limited success with autologous CAR T-cell therapies, likely due to the T- cell 
exhaustion associated with this malignancy ( Riches et al, 2013). Thus, the administration of 
healthy donor T cells in allogeneic CAR T-cell therapy has the potential to overcome current challenges in CLL treatment.  
As noted above, allogeneic CAR T- cell therapy  offers potential advantages compared with 
autologous CAR T-cell therapies. The activity of PBCAR20A has been investigated in 
immunodeficient mice. In a subcutaneous B- cell lymphoma model, all mice in the control group 
showed evidence of increasing tumor burden and only 1 of 5 mice survived past Day 22; at 
Day 56, 3 of the 5 mice treated with PBCAR20A survived and were tumor free. These results 
show potent in vivo clearance of C D20+ tumor cells by PBCAR20A and support its development 
as an allogeneic CAR T -cell therapy.  
Based on this context, PBCAR20A will be initially evaluated (Phase 1) for safety in subjects 
with no standard treatment options. After a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and 
lymphodepletion regimen are established, other lines of therapy in specific populations may be 
considered in Phase 2a, based on evidence of efficacy and safety observations that would inform risk/benefit rationale for Phase 2a Arms.  
1.2.3. Lymphodeple tion 
Due to the allogeneic nature of PB CAR20A, it is expected that allogeneic rejection will occur at 
some point after infusion. At the time of study initiation, it is unknown what the timeframe of rejection will be.  
Based on observations with other PBCAR products that have been in the clinic longer than PBCAR20A , such as PBCAR0191, Precision Biosciences has reason to believe that  alternative 
lymphodepletion regimens may be required to maximize expansion and persistence of PBCAR20A. As a result, alternative lymphodepletion regimens are under consideration. Potential regimens are based on historical clinical trial data and/or in vitro evaluations suggesting 
the selected regimens are likely to reduce rejection of allogeneic cells without reducing the 
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021)  
28 transfusion and adequate neutrophil counts. Prophylactic antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals 
are encouraged pe r institutional standards.  
1.2.3.3. Lymphodepletion Alternative: Tolerance induction  
Based on the observations of clinical efforts to reduce graft versus host disease (GvHD) in haploidentical allogeneic stem cell transplant, a post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) 
regimen may have the potential to selectively target T cells activated against mismatc hed 
allogeneic antigens. Indeed, haploidentical allogeneic stem cell transplant after preparative 
chemotherapy results in clonal expansion of dono r T cells against patient normal tissue antigens 
(allogen eic priming). When this is followed by high dose cyclophosphamide at a specified 
interval, those expanding T cells are selectively destroyed, which significantly reduces the GvHD complications in thi s setting  (Storb et al, 1970). Following this immunologic rationale, it 
is possible that a “priming” dose of P BCAR20A may cause allogeneic activation of T cell 
populations against the allo-antigens in PBCAR20A, providing a window of opportunity to use high dose cyclophosphamide after a low dose of PBCAR20A to reduce allogeneic rejection. 
Following that, a full dose of PBCAR20A would be administered for full treatment effect. 
However, it is known that cyclophosphamide alone does not provide adequate cytokine support for CAR T expansion in autologous CAR T studies and that the addition of fludarabine can 
significantly increase CAR T expansion ( Hay et al, 2017). This is also consistent with our 
observations in our PBCAR0191- 01 clinical trial. Therefore, in addi tion to the high dose 
cyclophosphamide used in PTCy, this regimen will also include fludarabine 30mg/m
2/day x 3 
days. The resulting regimen is: 
- PBCAR20A 30 x 106 cells (flat dose) on day -7 
- Cyclophosphamide 50m/kg/day x 2 days on days -5 and -4 
- Fludarabine 30mg/m2/day x 3 days on days -5, - 4 and -3 
- PBCAR20A treatment dose on day 0 
1.2.3.4. Lymphodepletion Alternative: Siro limus  
Because the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide regimens (both standard and enhanced) have effectively resulted in CAR T expansion, those regim ens may be best suited to combine with an 
additional agent that could delay T cell mediated allogene ic rejecti on. Based on our observations, 
it is likely that an agent that could prevent T cell rejection could  increase peak CAR T expansion 
and delay reject ion, both of which would increase the AUC of PBCAR20A.  
Multiple agents are used in clinical practice to preve nt T cell mediated allogeneic antigen 
targeting, specifically to prevent or reduce the severity of GvHD after allogeneic stem cell transplant. Of those agents, sirolimus is known to inhibit GvHD by interfering with the 
production of Th1 cytotoxic cytokines ( Blazar et al, 1998; Arman et al, 2008) This mechanism 
prevents native T cell receptor (TCR) signaling from inducing T cell activation. However, CAR 
T cells, including PBCAR20A (and other PBCAR products), do not require native TCR 
signaling for target engagement, activation, and killing because the signaling motifs are built into the CAR construct. Prior reported preclinical data suggest CAR T cells can function as well or 
better in the presence of sirolimus compared with the absence of sirolimus ( Oldham e t al, 2018). 
Because the balance of positive effects (reducing host T cell allogeneic rejection of PBCAR20A) 
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021)  
29 would be difficult to assess relative to the potential negative effect (impact on PBCAR20A 
tumor-killing and expansion capability) and because the risk to the subjects is expected to be 
lower than severe lymphodepletion using chemotherapy, we seek to explore the impact of sirolimus in the only known relevant model for this combination, in human subjects with active cancer.   
Taken together, the net b enefit of sirolimus may allow better CAR  T efficacy as a result of minor 
impact on CAR T expansion and killing while significantly delaying CAR T rejection. The resulting regimen is: 
- Either standard or enhanced lymphodepletion regimens as described  
- PBCAR2 0A treatment dose on day 0 
- Sirolimus 16  mg oral loading dose day 1 
- Sirolimus 4  mg/day until day 60* 
* Note: 4mg/day maintenance dose may be adjusted up or down based on sirolimus serum levels, 
with a target serum concentration of 20-30 ng/dL; site staff will be reminded to stop sirolimus 
dosing immediately if evidence of infection is observed. 
1.2.4. Rationale for Phase 2a populations 
1.2.4.1. Arm A – PBCAR20A in subjects with CLL/SLL being treated with ibrutinib 
therapy for at least 12 months 
Preclinical and clinical data  indicate ibrutinib may be synergistic w ith CAR T therapy in CLL. 
Indeed, longer prior treatment with ibrutinib seems to portend greater CAR T cell efficacy in this 
population ( Fraietta et al, 2016 ). It has been suggested that CAR T cell “consolidation” therapy 
may be ideally timed after  initial response to ibrutinib in advanced CLL ( Gauthier et al, 2020; 
Kater et al, 2020 ). Based on published literature, the use of PBCAR20A in subjects who have 
been treated for at least 12 months with ibrutinib may provide substantial benefit by further reducing tumor burden. Due to the decreased tumor burden expected from ibrutinib therapy, it is 
also possible that the CAR T expansion will not need to reach a high peak, decreasing the risk of 
CRS and ICANS. Subjects will a lso be likely to have received l ess total CD20 -targeting therapy 
over time, increasing the likelihood of target antigen presence at time of treatment. Together, this population may be an ideal opportunity to evaluate the clinical benefit of PBCAR20A.  
 
1.2.4.2. Arm  B – PBCAR20A in subjects with h igh grade DLBCL who did not achieve 
complete response after 2 cycles of front -line therapy  
The clinical benefit of autologous CAR T cells has been linked, retrospectively, to lower tumor 
burden at baseline. Multiple publications have suggested that peak CAR T expansion relative to 
baseline tumor burden is closely correlated with likelihood of complete response (CR) and durability of response ( Cappell et al, 2020; Locke et al, 2020). Recent clinical data from the 
Zuma -12 clini cal trial ( Neelapu, ASH 2020) su ggests greater efficacy may be attainable in earlier 
lines of therapy when tumor burden is lower and there may be less tumor heterogeneity and potential antigen loss. Because CD20 expression can be lost or reduced over time with repeated 
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021)  
30 treatment with CD2 0 targeting agents, a deeper and more durable anti- tumor effect may be 
achieved by using a CD20 targeting CAR T in the earliest therapeutic setting in which an 
opportunity exists and no conflict with standard of care is present. In this group of patients, who are being treated with front line therapy (R-CHOP) and do not achieve complete response, 
overall prognosis is poor ( Van Den Neste et al, 2015; Klink et al, 2020; Crump et al, 2017; 
Ekberg et al, 2017; Koh et al, 2018). Additionally, no standard of care is established in this 
setting, providing an opportunity to evaluate a novel agent that may improve outcomes for these subjects. By selecting subjects in whom initial chemotherapy (R -CHOP) has  debulked  the initial 
tumor ( PR required for eligibility) , and because only limited use of CD20 targeting therapy has 
been employed, PBCAR20A therapy may result in deep and meaningful clinical response with overall lower risk of adverse events (compared to later stage disease with bul ky tumor masses) 
due to lower initial tumor burden.   
1.2.4.3. Arm C – PBCAR20A in subjects with high grade B cell Non -Hodgkin’s 
Lymphoma (NHL) who have previously been treated with autologous CAR T 
products and have subsequently experienced disease progression  
After treatment with commercially available autologous CAR T products, most patients with 
high grade B cell Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma are left with no treatment options of known benefit, 
and, in most cases, repeat treatment with autologous CAR T cells is not a via ble option due to 
cost or loss of CD19 expression. As of January 2021, we have enrolled 6 subjects with high 
grade lymphomas who have previously received autologous CAR T cells. Of those, most (4 of 6, 
66.6%) had been documented as being refractory to CD 19 CAR T therapy as best response prior 
to enrollment in the present PBCAR20A study ; the remaining subjects were 1 PR and 1 CR. Five 
of the 6 have now been evaluated for PBCAR20A  response to date, with 3 of 5 (60%) achieving 
partial (2 of 5, 40%) or complete (1 of 5, 20%) response . The patient who reached complete 
response is in an ongoing complete response after 7 months on study.  Arm C will more 
prospectively explore PBCAR20A treatment effect in this population otherwise lacking 
treatment options once the RP2D and LD regimen have been defined. 
 
1.3. Benefit/risk assessment  
As this will be  the first clinical trial of PBCAR20A, the benefit to subjects  with NHL and 
CLL/SLL is not known. In a Phase 2a study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), an autologous anti-CD20 CAR T immunotherapy 
demonstrated a significant clinical benefit versus current standard of care in s ubjects  with 
advanced B-cell lymphomas as measured by ORR, the proportion of subjects  with complete 
response (CR), partial response (PR), and progression free survival, with no significant toxicities (Zhang et al, 2016). Axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta
™), an autologous anti- CD19 CAR Tcell 
immunotherapy, was shown in clinical trials to provide a significant clinical benefit versus 
current standard of care as measured by complet e remission rate and DoR and has been approved 
for the treatment of adult subjec ts with r/r large B -cell lymphoma after ≥2 lines of systemic 
therapy, including DLBCL not otherwise specified, primary mediastinal Bcell lymphoma (PMBCL), high grade B- cell lymphoma, and DLBCL arising from FL. Tisagenlecleucel 
(Kymriah
™), an autologous anti-CD19 CAR T immunotherapy, was shown in clinical trials to 
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021)  
31 provide a significant clinical benefit versus current standard of care as measured by complete 
remission rate, the d uration of CR, and the proportion of subjects  with a CR and minimal 
residual disease (MRD) <0.01% by flow cytometry, and has been approved for treatment of B-
ALL that is refractory or in a second or later relapse in subjects  up to 25 years of age and in adult 
subjects  with r/r large B -cell lymphoma after ≥2 lines of systemic therapy including DLBCL not 
otherwise specified, high grade B-cell lymphoma, and DLBCL arising from FL. Toxicities, including serious and life- threatening toxicities associated with development of cytokine release 
syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell- associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), were 
observed in clinical trials for both of these anti- CD19 CAR T -cell therapies. Such toxicities are 
associated with the mechanism of action of these drugs and, for most subjects, resolve over a 
period of days to weeks with appropriate supportive care or, in severe cases, with medical 
intervention.  
The potential of PBCAR0191 to cause GvHD was examined in a xenogeneic immunodeficient 
NSG mouse model. The NS G mice were sublethally irradiated on Day 1 to stimulate cell damage  
and tissue repair, which results in the activation of antigen-presenting cells and upregulation of 
major histocompatibility complex molecules on mouse tissues. On Day 2, the mice were inj ected 
with a control vehicle, T- cell control (mock gene‐edited, TCR
+ human CD4+/CD8+ T cells or 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMC]), or gene- edited (TCR-) CAR T cells from the same 
donor. Animals that received the mock gene-edited or unmanipulated P BMC (TCR+) donor 
T cells lost weight and developed clinical symptoms  consistent with GvHD. In contrast, all 
animals that received the gene‐edited (TCR-) CAR T cells behaved similarly to animals that were 
treated with the control vehicle and continued to gain weight and groom normally showing no 
behavioral signs of toxicity after recovery from radiation. The findings are supported by a 
confirmatory study using PBCAR20A and together demonstrate a lack of GvHD upon administration of gene edited CAR T cells.  
PBCAR20A is a second generation anti- CD20 CAR T -cell product manufactu red using healthy 
donor T cells as the starting material through a process that preserves naïve and central memory phenotypes and comprises an approximately equal proportion of CD4
+ and CD8+ T cells. 
Although one might expect the nature and severity of toxicities to be similar to those observed for the approved anti- CD19 CAR T -cell products, Yescarta
™ and Kymriah™, the uniform 
composition and phenotype of the CAR T cells within PBCAR20A may result in improved 
clinical responses. As there are no currently approved anti- CD20 CAR T -cell therapies, 
PBCAR20A may provide benefit in subjects  who have failed autologous anti-CD19 therapies 
and subjects  with CLL who exhibit features of T- cell exhausti on.  
PBCAR20A has been reproducibly manufactured to the desired specifications from multiple 
healthy donors at a commercial manufacturing scale. Multiple batches of PBCAR20A have been evaluated for various parameters to characterize the genetic stability o f the product. Importantly, 
the gene edited - CAR T -cell batches have similar profiles including consistent targeted insertion 
of the CAR transgene at the intended location within the T- cell receptor alpha constant locus 
with similar low frequency of translocations and off- target gene -editing between batches. The 
potential risks of CRS, ICANS, and GvHD will be managed and mitigated during the study (Section  7.3).  
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected adverse events (AEs) of PBCAR20A can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).

3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1. Overall study  design  
This is a Phase 1/2a, nonrandomized, open- label, dose  escalation, and dose- optimization  study to 
evaluate the safety and clinical activity of PBCAR20A in adults with r/r CD20+ B-cell NHL , 
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021)  
34 including r/r CD20+ CLL/SLL, and identify a treatment regime n to optimize  clinical efficacy 
while maintaining a favorable safety profile. The Phase 1 study schematic and Schedule of 
Activities (SoA) are shown in  Table 2 and Se ction  3.1.1, respectively . 
In this protocol amendment (Version 5.0), specific populations have been defined for potential 
enrollment in  Phase 2a to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of PBCAR20A using the identified 
RP2D and selected lymphodepletion regimen as wel l as to further characterize safety profile  and 
correlative biology.  
All subjects will receive  an intravenous (IV) PBCAR20A  on Day 0 of the study. 
Lymphodepletion chemotherapy will also be administered. The initial lymphodepletion 
chemotherapy regimen will be composed of fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day) and cyclophosphamide 
(500 mg/m2/day) during the Screening Period from Days -5 to -3. However, the l ymphodepletion 
regimen may be modified if satisfactory CAR T -cell expansion and/or persistence is not 
observed. T he lymphodepletion regimen will be assigned at the time of registration  to treatment. 
Alternative lymphodepletion strategies will only be emplo yed after safety has been established in 
each dose level. Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual for the specific re gimen assigned at the 
time of registration; the lymphodepletion regimen may  be discussed between the Sponsor 
Medical Monitor, Principal Investigators, and contract research organization Medical Monitor prior to assignment.  
For Phase 2a, the treatment regi men is expected to be uniform for all subjects enrolled into each 
arm.  
Specific criteria must be met for repeat lymphodepletion prior to repeat PBCAR20A infusion. In 
all Phase 1 Dose levels  and the Phase 2a A rms, subjects may be considered for retreatment  if 
there is documented clinically meaningful response to the initial treatment with PBCAR20A as determined by the Investigator ; the criteria and procedures for retreatment are described in  
Section  3.7. 
3.1.1. Phase 1  (dose escalatio n): 
In Phase 1 , 3 escalating dose groups will be enrolled and treated sequentially, with the possibility 
of a single de- escalation (see Section  3.5).  Within each dose group, at least 3 and at most 6 study 
subjects will be treated with a single dose of PBCAR20A using a standard 3 + 3 design. The 
starting dose of PBCAR20A will be 1 × 10
6 CAR T cells/kg body weight. In the absence of 
DLTs (as described in  Section  3.8), s ubsequent dose groups will be treated with escalating doses 
to a maximum flat dose of 480 × 106 CAR T cells. If no MTD is reached additional dose levels 
may be explored. 
The first treated subject  in each dose level  (including the dose de- escalation  group, i.e., Dose - 1) 
will be observed for 14 days for safety before any subsequent subject  receives any study 
treatment to provide an adequate safety monitoring window. once the first study subject in each 
dose level has completed Day 14 after dosing with no DLTs, then subsequent subject s can be 
enrolled without delays into that dose level.  
Dose escalation may proceed once safety of the current dose level has been established, which is 
dependent upon the last study participant enrolled in the current dose level completing the 28-day DLT evaluation period. 
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021)  
35 A DLT is defined as any treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) that meets the criteria 
specified in Section  3.8. If a DLT is observed in ≤1 of 3 study subject s at a given dose level, up 
to 3 additional study subject s (for a total of u p to 6 study subject s) may be enrolled and treated at 
that dose level. When 3 additional study subject s are added to the dose group, the dose will be 
increased to the next dose level if ≤1 of 6 study subjects experiences a DLT. If ≤ 2 of the 3 to 6 
study su bject s in a dose group experience DLTs, the MTD has been exceeded, and up to 3 
additional study subject s (for a total of 6) will be tre ated at the previous (lower) dose level.  
The MTD in this study is defined as the highest dose at which ≤1 of 6 study subjects experiences 
a DLT.  If the MTD is not exceeded, the sponsor will choose the recommended Phase 2a dose based on 
observations of cli nical efficacy, safety, and/or cell kinetics.  
The investigators, medical monitor, and sponsor , designated as the Safety R eview Committee 
(SRC)  will monitor and convene to review safety data, including any delayed toxicities caused 
by PBCAR20A, at regular i ntervals to discuss any unexpected significant toxicities and to 
determine whether dose escalation is appropriate.  
After  the conclusion of P hase 1, the SRC  will convene to determine whether Phase 2 can 
proceed . If DLTs are found to occur predominantly in one subtype of NHL subjects (i.e., those 
with indolent lymphoma, including follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma or aggressive lymphoma, such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma, PMBCL, Burkit t lymphoma,  and other high grade T cell lymphomas), 
the possibility of separating the cohorts for dose escalation may be explored. 
Up to 18 subjects total may be enrolled in any given dose level for which safety has been 
established (i.e.,0 of 3 or ≤ 1 of 6 subjects  experiences a DLT)  for characterization of the 
pharmacology, safety profile, and clinical bene fit profile . These additional 12 subjects (any 
subjects after  or , respectively ) will not be considered for determination of the MTD 
and can be enrolled without delays into that dose level. In these additional subjects, modified lymphodepletion regimens may be employed, as assigned at the time of study registration and defined in the P harmacy Manual , 
to evaluate regimens which may increase anti -tumor effect and 
improve PBCAR20A cellular kinetics.  
All study subjects are monitored for DLTs and AEs during the Treatment Period through Day 28. 
Study subjects will continue to be monitored for safety after Day 28 and will be followed until death, disease progression, stem cell transplant, withdrawal due to intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or Day 360, whichever occurs first.

3.1.2. Phase 2a ( dose expansion) 
Phase 2a A rms are intended to evaluate preliminary efficacy and further characterize safety in 
specific subject populations. As a result, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for these Arms are 
more specific than Phase 1.  
Phase 2a A rms will use a dose level at or b elow the MTD established in Phase 1. The dose will 
be determined based on PK/PD analysis, safety evaluation, and preliminary evidence of clinical 
activity. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for the specific treatment regimen, including  
lymphodepletion, to be us ed in each Arm.  
All Phase 2a A rms will initiate simultaneously and will enroll in parallel.  
Upon selection of the recommended P hase 2 a dose (RP2D) and associated lymphodepletion 
regimen, subjects will be enrolled to characterize  clinical efficacy, safety , and pharmacology in 
that population. The populations are defined by the inclusion / exclusion criteria for Phase 2a. All subjects in any P hase 2a group are expected to meet all eligibility criteria and be treated in a 
consistent fashion within the group. 
3.1.2.1. Phase 2a Arm A Population : CLL/SLL being treated with ibrutinib therapy for 
at least 12 months 
Phase 2a Arm  A will enroll subjects with 
a confirmed diagnosis  of CD20+ CLL/SLL who are 
being treated with ibrutinib. Subjects must have started ibrutinib at least 12 months prior to 
treatment with PBCAR20A and must have achieved SD or  a PR  and be receiving maintenance 
ibrutinib. No prior CR is allowed. Subjects must also have high risk cytogenetics, defined  as 
del17p or TP53 mutation. Other inclusion exclusion, in common with Phase  1, are found in 
Section  4.1 and Section  4.2. 
 
3.1.2.2. Phase 2a Arm B Population : DLBCL who did not achieve complete response 
after 2 cycles of front -line therapy  
 

Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021)  
37 Phase 2a Arm B will enroll subjects  with diagnosis of DLBCL who have completed treatment 
with first line chemotherapy (R -CHOP) and have reached PR but not CR. Subjects must have 
evidence of measurable or evaluable disease demonstrating a lack of CR to first  line therapy. 
Subjects who have progressed on (are refractory to) first  line therapy are not eligible. Other 
medical criteria in common with Phase 1 must be met, as identified in Section  4.1 and 
Section  4.2. 
3.1.2.3. Phase 2a Arm C Population: H igh grade B cell Non -Hodgkin’s Lymphoma 
(NHL) who have previously been treated with autologous CAR T products and 
have subsequently experienced disease progression  
Phase 2a Arm C will enroll subjects who have relapsed or refractory (r/r) high grade B cell 
lymphomas as defined in Section  4.1 who have been previous ly treated with CD19 -targeted 
autologous CAR T therapy. Response to prior CAR T therapy is not required, but subjects must 
have evidence of progressive disease to be eligible. Disease must be measurable or evaluable by Lugano Criteria.  
 
3.1.3. Long- term follow -up study : 
Study subject s who receive a dose of PBCAR20A will be followed in a separate LTFU, PBCAR -
LTF, study after exiting this study (due to either discontinuation or completion). The LTFU 
study procedures will be described in a separate protocol.

routine care within 6  weeks of initiating lymphodepletion chemotherapy may be used for Screening.  
f Clinical laboratory tests for safety assessments are outlined in Section  7.1.4. Clinical laboratory tests can be p erformed up to 24 hours before dosing on Day 0. 
g Coagulation panel may be perform ed after Baseline if the investigator considers it necessary.  
h Vital signs should be measured on the day of dosing at 5 minutes (±2 minutes) before dosing, then at the end of infusion (±5 minutes), 60 minutes after the end of infusion (±10 minutes), and 4 hours (±15 minutes) after the end of infusion. Vital signs should also be collected as clinically indicated.
 
i Additional ECGs will be collected as clinically indicated.  
j The initial lymphodepletion chemotherapy regimen will be composed of fludarabine (3 0 mg/m2/day IV) and cyclophosphamide (500  mg/m2/day IV) during the 
Screening Period from Days - 5 to - 3. However, modified lymphodepletion regimens may be used after safety is  established in dose level. The lymphodepletion 
regimen will be specified at the time of registration. Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual for the lymphodepletion dosing regimen; lymphodepletion status may 
be discussed between the Sponsor Medical Monitor, Principal Investigators, and contract research organization Medical Monitor prior to registration . 
k Study subjects are evaluated for the following restrictions 2 hours (±60 minutes) prior to receiving the PBCAR20A infusion: new uncontrolled infection afte r 
receipt of lymphodepletion, fever, taking any corticosteroid beyond the replacement details, rapid acceleration of malignant disease, and any organ dysfunction 
since Screening. Additional details are provided in Section 5.1.1 . At the investigator’s discretion, study subjects may receive premedication 1 hour (±15 
minutes) prior to receiving the PBCAR20A infusion with oral acetaminophen and oral or IV diphenhydramine according to the institutional standards.  
l Study participant diaries will be provided to study subjects on Day 0 to monitor temperature, at least daily, during the first 28 days. 
m . The PET -CT scan conducted as part of the routine care within 4 weeks of PBCAR20A administration may be used for Screening purposes. If the scan is 
performed as a part of routine care, the result will be obtained from the study participant’s physician or medical record.  
n A PET -CT scan on Day 14 is optional and will be determined by the investigator. Additional details are provided in Section 8.4. 
o Screening tumor biopsy may be omitted if a study participant has had a biopsy showing CD20+ disease within 6 months before Screening and has not received 
any anti -CD20+ therapy since then. Note: If the tumor is CD20 -negative by flow cytometry, it should be evaluated by immunohistochemistry as flow assays 
may result in false negatives due to competition with CD20 targeting treatment antibodies (e.g. rituximab).  
p  Tumor biopsy may be performed to confirm imaging changes as clinically indicated. Additional b iopsies may be performed pending Sponsor approval.  
q Exploratory analyses will be performed by the central laboratory. Additional analyses performed at the site that are not required by t he protocol should be 
captured in the eCRF. 
r Blood samples will be c ollected before PBCAR20A administration on Day 0.  
s If available, the central laboratory will also test fresh BMA or bone marrow core samples for CAR T cells.  
t MRD assessment will be per formed at Screening for all study subjects. Please consult the Laboratory Manual for specific sample requirements at Screening. At 
subsequent visits, MRD assessment will only be performed for study subjects who meet other standard response criteria (see Se ction  8.1). Please consult the 
Laboratory Manual for specific sample requirements at all subsequent visits. Note that these samples are disease- specific and may be different between 
Screening and all subsequent visits.

3.3. Number of subject s 
Phase 1  (dose escalation):  Approximately 9 to 30 evaluable subjects are planned to be enrolled 
in the dose escalation phase of the study. 
Phase 2a (dose expansion ): Each arm may enroll up to 20 subjects  for a total of up to 60 
subjects . Futility may be determined in a rolling fashion at the sponsor’s discretion.  
3.4. Number of Study Centers  
Approximately 10-15 study centers in the United States. 
3.5. Discuss ion of study design and dose justification  
This is a first -in-human, Phase 1/2a study intended primarily to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of PBCAR20A in study subject s with NHL including CLL/SLL. A single -arm, open 
label design has been chosen becau se of the early stage of development and the nee d for close 
monitoring for safety. This study is not controlled because of the serious nature of the conditions 
being studied and the lack of alternative therapies. 
Unlike small molecules and biologic drugs, optimum dosing in adoptive cell therapy (ACT) 
cannot be determined using classical pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic parameters based 
on body weight or body surface area (BSA). This is because cellular immunotherapies are 
“living” drugs that may expand within a patient following administration. Cellu lar 
immunotherapies, such as CAR T-cell products, are not metabolized in the liver or excreted by 
the kidney, and the sites and volume of distribution are not clearly understood. Therefore, dosing 
of CAR T -cell therapies based on weight or BSA is not driven by a clear understanding of PK 
parameters. Furthermore, the relationship between toxicity and therapeutic activity is not 
monotonic for ACTs. According to the FDA’s guidance, “…conventional allometric scaling 
methods for cell  and gene  therapy (CGT) produ cts may be less precise than for small  molecule 
drugs, and traditional PK and pharmacodynamic correlations might not be possible. Therefore, it 
may be difficult to establish an initial starting dose based on the considerations used for small-
molecule drugs. If available, previous clinical experience with the CGT product or related products, even if by a different route of administration or for a different condition, might help to justify the clinical starting dose” ( FDA, 2015).  
Dose -finding trials in oncology are designed to find the MTD, the highest dose at which the 
observed toxicity rate is less than a prespecified target probability. A starting dose that is thought 
to be safe in humans is normally selected based on a combination of PK, pharmacodynamics, 
toxicity, and efficacy observations in animal models of human disease. However, in the case of CAR T -cell therapies, there is no relevant species other than humans that can be used to model 
drug safety and efficacy. Observations of toxicity or efficacy based on doses of human CAR T cells administered to immunodeficient mice bearing human tumors are useful as qualitative indicators of the likelihood of toxicity or efficacy in humans, but those data cannot be quantitatively translated (i.e., allometrically sc aled) in selecting a safe starting dose in humans.  
In this study, we selected a starting dose, dose-escalation intervals, and 4 dose levels (including possible de- escalation) to be evaluated in Phase 1 based  upon toxicity observed in 
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021) 
43 immunodeficient mice (tumor bearing and nontumor bearing) that were administered various 
doses of PBCAR20A, as well as on the observations of toxicity and antitumor activity in human clinical studies of autologous anti- CD20 CAR T -cell treatments. For examp le, doses as high as 
1.0 × 10
7 PBCAR20A CAR T cells (equivalent to 5.0 × 108 cells/kg in humans based solely on 
mg/kg conversion) were administered to immunodeficient mice bearing disseminated human lymphoma tumors without signs of toxicity, while doses in an order of lower magnitude still 
provided for significant antitumor efficacy. The potential for PBCAR20A to cause GvHD was 
evaluated in a xenogeneic mouse model in which doses as high as 3.0 × 10
7 PBCAR20A cells, 
the equivalent of 1.2 × 109 cells/kg in a  human (based solely on cells/kg conversion), were 
administered without any signs of development of GvHD. Several studies involving HLA nonidentical stem cell transplant procedures have concluded that a threshold of approximately 5.0 × 10
4 residual CD3+ donor T cells/kg can be contained within the donor graft without 
significant risk of resulting GvHD ( Muller et al, 1999; Aversa et al, 1998). The proposed starting 
dose of PBCAR20A for this study is 1 × 106 CAR T cells/kg of body weight. This dose would 
contain 1.5 to 6.0 × 103 residual CD3+ T cells/kg, which is within the range considered to be a 
low risk for GvHD based on literature from unrelated donor bone marrow and stem cell transplants ( Muller et al, 1999), and thus, should not represent a significant risk for causing 
GvHD in an HLA -mismatched host.  
The proposed starting dose and the dose-escalation intervals are also supported by observations of safety and efficacy in clinical trials of autologous anti- CD19 CAR T cells in ad ult and 
pediatric study subject s with r/r ALL and r/r NHL. Greater emphasis was given to trials of 
autologous CAR T-cell products in which the CD19-targeting moiety (FMC63 murine antihuman-CD19 single-chain variable fragment [scFv]) and signaling domains (4- 1BB + CD3ζ) 
are more simi lar to the CAR construct of PBCAR0191, namely Novartis’ CTL019 
(tisagenlecleucel) and Juno Therapeutics’ JCAR017; however, dosing information for Kite Pharmaceuticals KTE -19 (axicabtagene ciloleucel), an autologous anti- CD19 CAR T- cell 
product in which the CAR construct consists of FMC63 scFv and CD28 and CD3ζ signaling 
domains, was also considered. For each of these CAR T- cell therapies, total doses of between 
1 × 10
7 and 6 ×108, with target doses of between 1 × 106 and 1 × 107 CAR T cells/kg, have been 
used in the clinic in adult subjects  and resulted in acceptable levels of toxicity and a high rate of 
efficacy in terms of complete remissions. Our proposed starting dose at 1 × 106 CAR T cells/kg 
falls below this range and is expected to provide an opportunity for meaningful efficacy while 
preserving a significant margin for safety.  
The initial lymphodepletion regimen (fludarabine [30 mg/m2/day] and cyclophosphamide 
[500 mg/m2/day]) in this study is a common conditioning treatment before CAR T -cell therapy 
(Locke et al, 2017).  The need to explore additional dosing and lymphodepletion regimens is  
based on findings from the currently ongoing PBCAR0191-01 study, in which PBCAR0191 has 
been well tolerated across doses ranging from 3 x 105 cells/kg to 6 x 106 cells/kg : as of 06 
November 2020, 27 subjects enrolled in the PBCAR0191-01 study across Dose Levels 1-4 have 
completed Day  28, all with  no observations of GvHD and no Grade ≥3 CRS or ICA NS. 
Similarly, PBCAR20A has been well tolerated in the subjects enrolled to date across doses 
ranging from 1 x 106 to 3 x 106 cells/kg , with 1 Grade 3 ICANS event was observed in a patient 
enrolled in Dose level 1 that was downgraded to Grade 2 within 24 hours. The classical development model for a novel therapy would be to increase the dose until either toxicity or maximum clinical benefit is reached; thus, the protocol was modified (Version 4.0) based on

Abbreviations: DLT=dose -limiting toxicity; MTD=maximum tolerated dose.  
*If at 480 × 106 cells (Dose  3), this would be the MTD.  
 
Phase 2a (dose optimization): 
Arms in Phase 2a will use a dose at or below the MTD as determined in Phase 1. The dose will 
be determined based on PK/PD analysis, safety evaluation, and preliminary evidence of clinical 
activity. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for the specific dose and treatment regimens to be used in each Arm. Phase 2a Arms are described in Secti on 3.1.2. 
3.7. Retreatment criteria  
Retreatment refers to the specific scenario in which a subject receives al l planned treatment and 
has some evidence of benefit followed by evidence of disease progression.  
All subjects will receive  PBCAR20A as per  Table  2. A subject may receive an additional dose of 
PBCAR20A if he/she meets retreatment criteria as determined by the investigator and agrees to 
be retreated.  
Subjects are eligible for retreatment only if the following criteria are met:  
• Subject has documented evidence of clinically meaningful tumor response to initial 
dose of PBCAR20A followed by documented either a disease progression at 
subsequent visit or has residual disease. 
Subject has biopsy-proven CD20+ tumor prior to re -treatment,  unless it is deemed not safe by 
multi- disciplinary team, Subject has no evidence of GvHD and no new unresolved disease -

Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021) 
46 related central nervous system (CNS) involvement that in the opinion of the investigator would 
impair the assessment of neurotoxicity events. 
• Subject has adequate bone marrow, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, and cardiac function as defined in Section  4.1. 
• Subject has not received another systemic treatment for NHL. 
Subjects who meet the retreatment cr iteria and have had a study visit within 30 days will undergo 
lymphodepletion chemotherapy and follow the SoA from the beginning. Subjects who meet the retreatment criteria and have discontinued the study will need to be re-enrolled into an open slot (Phas e 1 or Phase 2a). Retreatment visits, starting from lymphodepletion visits, will be 
distinguished from initial visits in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
Subjects eligible for retreatment may  receive PBCAR20A at the highest dose level with 
establish ed safety (see Section  3.1).  
 
3.8. Criteria for DLT s 
During the DLT period (28 days after dosing the last subject in a dose level ), severity grades will 
be determined using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 unless otherwise specified.  
Regardless of the investigator attribution or unless there is a clear alternative explanation, a DLT 
is defined as any of the following TEAEs:  
• CRS (per American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy [ASTCT] 
consensus grading; see Section  7.3.1):  
− Any Grade 4  
− Any Grade 3 that does not resolve or reduce to Grade ≤2 within 72 hours of onset  
• GvHD: Acute GvHD Grade ≥2 regardless of the organ involved that does not resolve with appropriate treatment within 14 days. 
• Any Grade ≥3 neurotoxicity (per American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy [ASTCT] ICANS criteria provided in Table 15) that does not resolve or reduce to Grade ≤2 within 72 hours of onset . 
• Any seizure 
• Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions related to the study treatment that does not resolve or decrease to Grade ≤2 within 48 hours  
• Any Grade 4 hematologic toxicity, except lymphopenia, that does not resolve or 
decrease to Grade ≤2 within 42 days  
• Any Grade 4 non- hematologic toxicity  
• Any Grade 3 toxicity involving heart and lungs 
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021) 
47 • Any Grade 3 toxicity involving kidney and liver that does not resolve or reduce 
Grade ≤2 within 7 days o f onset 
• Any Grade 3 toxicity to other organs that does not resolve or reduce Grade ≤2 within 72 hours of onset  
• Any Grade 5 toxicity that was not due to underlying malignancy 
If an AE is clearly due to progressive or underlying disease and unrelated to the study treatment, the event would not be considered a DLT.  
3.9. Criteria for treatment interruption  
The infusion of PBCAR20A should be i nterrupted immediately if the following situation occurs:  
• Severe hypersensitivity reaction, including anaphylaxis 
The investigator will evaluate the study participant and determine whether the infusion can be 
resumed or should be permanently discontinued. If infusion is resumed, study subjects  should 
receive the remainder of the dose not yet administered at one- half the rate of the initial infusion. 
If the infusion will not be completed within 2 hours from thawing, a new dose should be prepared for the rem ainder. If not already administered within 2 hours of restarting infusion, a 
minimum dose of 25 mg diphenhydramine (oral) should be administered prior to restarting 
infusion. 
3.10. Criteria for temporarily suspending treatment  
In addition to the staggered dosing schedule ( 14 days between the first 2 study subjects in each 
dose group, including the dose de-escalation group if applicable), dosing in all study subjects , 
regardless of cohort and dose group, will temporarily stop if any of the following events occur:  
• Any Grade 4 toxicity that is possibly or probably related to PBCAR20A  
• Grade ≥3 GvHD  
• Any death that is possibly or probably related to the study treatment  
Investigators and the medical monitor will conduct a comprehensive assessment of the event, the causal relationship to study treatment, and cumulative evidence of toxicity to determine whether the study can continue.  
3.11. Crite ria for study termination  
The study can be terminated by the sponsor, Safety Review Committee, Institutional Review Board (IRB), or FDA at any time.  
4. SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF STUDY SUBJECTS

study visits or procedures, including follow-up visits, or is unlikely to comply with the study requirements for participation. 
40. Any mental condition rendering the subject  unable to understand the nature, scope, and 
possible consequences of the study, and/or evidence of an uncooperative a ttitude.  
4.3. Screening  
4.3.1. Screening procedures  
After signing the ICF, potential study subjects will be screened (starting at Day -28) for 
eligibility to participate in the prior to receiving lymphodepletion chemotherapy (Day -5). The Screening procedures are lis ted in the SoA ( Table 2). 
Brain MRI is required at Screening for all NHL study subject s with a history of CNS disease 
who have not had an MRI within 6 weeks of initiating lymphodepletion chemotherapy.  
Screening PE T-CT scan for NHL subjects should be performed prior to initiating 
lymphodepletion treatment. The PET- CT scan conducted as a part of the routine care within 
4 weeks of PBCAR20A administration may be used for Screening purposes. If the scan is 
performed as a part of routine care, the result will be obtained from the study participant’s 
physician or medical record. 
Recent tumor biopsy results, obtained within 6 months before study entry, are acceptable to 
confirm histological diagnosis, provided the study par ticipant  has not received any anti-CD20 
therapy between the time of the biopsy and study entry.  
4.3.2. Screen failures  
Screen failures are defined as study subject s who consent to participate in the clinical study but 
are not subsequently enrolled or treated. A minimal set of screen failure information is required 
to be recorded at the site to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure subjects  to meet the 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regula tory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, 
eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event (SAE).  
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may be rescreened. Rescreened study subject s should be assigned the same study participant number as 
for the initial screening.  
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021) 
53 4.4. Study discontinuation or withdrawal  
Study interventions, including lymphodepletion and PBCAR20A administration, should be 
discontinued by the investigator if the investigator believes that it is in the best interest of the 
study participant or if any of the following situations occur:  
• Disease progression ; subjects  should complete the 28- day safety evaluation period if 
possible 
• Death  
• Initiation of another s ystemic treatment for NHL, SLL, or CLL  
• Investigator’s decision 
• Study participant noncompliance/protocol violations 
• Study terminated by sponsor (see Section  3.11) 
• Study participant withdrawal (see Section  4.4.1) 
• Lost to follow- up (see Section  4.4.2) 
Upon completion, study subject s will be followed  in a separate LTFU study.  
4.4.1. Study participant withdrawal  
A study participant may withdr aw from the stu dy at any time at his/her own request or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons.  
If the study participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
If a study participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples 
taken and not tested, and the investigator must doc ument this in the site study records. 
4.4.2. Lost to follow- up 
A study participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study center.  
The following actions must be taken if a stud y participant fails to return to the study center for a 
required study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact the study participant to reschedule the missed visit as 
soon as possible, counsel the study participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule, and ascertain whether the study participant wishes to and/or 
should continue in the study. 
• Before a study participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee 
must make every effort to regain contact with the study participant (where possible, 
3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the study participant’s last 
known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should 
be documented in the study participant’s medi cal record. 
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021) 
54 • Should the study participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to 
have withdrawn from the study. 
4.5. Study completion  
A subject  is considered to have completed the study’s primary evaluation if he/she has completed 
Day 28. Subje cts ex periencing disease progression prior to day 28 should continue on the study 
through Day 28 to allow for completion of study’s primary evaluation as long as another 
systemic therapy is not started. A subject is considered to have completed the entire study if the 
subject  is followed according to the protocol to the Day 360 visit, disease progression, death, or 
receiving a new treatment for the diagnosed malignancy (including stem cell transplant), whichever occurs first.  
5. STUDY INTERVENTION  
Study intervention is defined as any investigational intervention(s), marketed product(s), placebo, or medical device(s) intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study protocol. 
5.1. Description of study treatment  
In this study, treatments include the investigational product, PBCAR20A, and lymphodepletion chemotherapy agents, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. 
5.1.1. Pre-infusion restrictions  
Before receiving the PBCAR20A infusion, each study participant will be evaluated for the 
following restrictions. If any  of the restrictions are met, the infusion will not be given, and the 
investigator should discuss with the medical monitor to reschedule or suspend the study 
treatment in the study participant.  
• New uncontrolled infection after receipt of lymphodepletion chemotherapy 
• Fever (body temperature ≥38.0°C)  
• Taking any corticosteroid beyond the replacement dose (masking of fever in neutropenic study subject s) 
• Rapid acceleration of malignant disease  
• Any organ dysfunction since Screening

5.1.3. Hospitalization  
Study subjects  with Burkitt lymphoma or high tumor burden DLBCL/Richter’s transformation 
CLL should receive prophylaxis for tumor lysis syndrome (including rasburicase, if indicated) 
and be hospitalized to undergo frequent monitoring (chemistries, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], 
and uric acid every 6 hours for up to 96 hours post-treatment). If tumor lysis does occur, there should be aggressive correction of electrolytes. 
For the remaining study subject s, inpatient hospitalization is generally not required for any 
component during the study. However, the investigator may choose to hospitalize study subject s 
based on his or her clinical judgment regarding the risks of tumor lysis syndrome or other 
conditions. 
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021) 
56 5.2. Concom itant medications  
Medications used for the management of AEs may be provided by the investigator according to 
institution guidelines and will be recorded as concomitant medications in the electronic Case 
Report Form (eCRF), but these treatments are not considered study treat ments.  
5.2.1. Premedication  
Before the administration of PBCAR20A, premedication according to institutional standards may be given at the investigator’s discretion. 
5.2.2. Prohibited medications and substances  
Study subjects  must not receive corticost eroids at doses higher than 5 mg/day of prednisone or 
equivalent at any time after the CAR T -cell infusion, except when medically necessary . 
Study subjects  must not receive filgrastim during the immediate pre -infusion period from 
Days -7 to 0 and post-infusion for 10 days, except when medically necessary . 
Study subjects  must not receive any additional anticancer therapy, except those expressly 
intended by the protocol (e.g. ibrutinib in Arm A), without prior discussion with the medical 
monitor. 
Study su bjects  are prohibited from excessive use of alcohol (defined as 4 or more alcoholic 
drinks per day) and from any use of illegal drugs. 
5.3. Treatment compliance  
Study personnel are required to record the date, time, study intervention (including fludarabine 
and cyclophosphamide), and dose administered to each study participant in the eCRF.

listed in Table 2. 
7.1.2. Physical examination 
A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the cardiovascular, 
respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems. Height and weight will also be measured 
and recorded.  
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. 
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021) 
58 7.1.3. Electrocardiogram  
Single 12- lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) w ill be obtained at time points listed in  Table 2 using 
an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart  rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, QTc, 
and QT corrected by Fredericia (QTcF) intervals.  
The ECGs are required to be done in triplicate; 3 individual ECG tracings should be obtained as 
closely as possible in succession, but no more than 2 minutes apart. The full set of triplicates should be completed in less than 4 minutes. 
7.1.4. Laboratory assessments 
Clinical laboratory tests can be performed up to 24 hours before dosing on Day 0. The tests listed 
below will be performed by local laboratories.

− HLA haplotype 
− Anti-HLA antibodies 
The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any 
clinically relevant changes that meet the definition of AEs in the eCRF. The laboratory reports 
must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those that are not associated with the  underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be 
more severe than expected for the study participant's condition. 
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021) 
60 All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation 
in the study should be repeated weekly until the values return to normal/Baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator or medical monitor. 
If clinically significant abnormal values do not return to normal/Baseline within a period of time 
judged reasonable by the investigator, the etiology should be determined, and the sponsor should be notified. 
If laboratory values from non-protocol-specified laboratory assessments performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in study participant management or are considered clinical ly significant by the investigator (e.g., SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results 
must be recorded in the eCRF. 
7.1.5. Immunogenicity  
Blood samples will be collected from all study subjects according to  Table 2 and analyzed at the 
local laboratory. These samples may be tested for immune reactivity against PBCAR20A when 
PBCAR20A is not detectable at early time points after administration. Blood samples may also 
be tested by local laboratories for donor-specific HLA antibodies.  
Blood samples should also be collected at the final visit and shipped to the central laboratory for 
study subject s who have discontinued study treatment or withdrawn from the study.  
7.2. AEs and SAEs  
7.2.1. Definition of  AEs  
7.2.1.1. AE 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation study participant administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
 
All AEs will be collected from the initiation of lymphodepletion chemotherapy until death, 
disease progression, subsequent systemic therapy, withdrawal due to intolerable toxicity, 
withdrawal of consent, or Day 360, whichever occurs first and be recorded in the eCRF, regardless of whet her or not they are related to the study treatment. All AEs collected through 
Day 28 will be used for assessment of DLTs; any AEs occurring after Day 28 will be considered  
in dose-escalation decisions and monitoring procedures as appropriate. 
All AEs, including SAEs, that occur after signing the ICF and before administration of any 
protocol- specified treatment will be recorded as Medical History in the appropriate eCRF.  
7.2.1.2. SAE  
An SAE is an AE occurring during the study and at any dose of the investigational product, comparator, or placebo that fulfills at least 1 of the following: 
• Results in death  
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021) 
61 • Is immediately life -threatening 
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions 
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the study participant or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
All SAEs that occur during the AE review period as noted above must be recorded in the eCRF, whether or not they are related to the study treatment. 
7.2.1.3. Adverse events of special interest  
The following adverse events of special interest (AESIs)  are AEs that are of particular concern in 
CAR T -cell therapy:  
• CRS  
• ICANS  (note: in the event of encephalitis, notify sponsor within 24 hours) 
• GvHD  
Because AESIs may theoretically occur after Day 28, AESIs will be assessed separately from 
AEs. Study subjec ts will be assessed for AESI from the administration of PBCAR20A through 
Day 360. Any occurrence of an AESI will be monitored closely until stabilization or resolution.  
See Section  7.2.5 for additional details r egarding reporting AESIs.  
7.2.2. Assessment of intensity  
The investigator will assess the intensity of each AE reported during the study based on the NCI 
CTCAE version 5.0 ( NCI CTCAE, 2018). If an AE is not addressed in NCI CTCAE, intensity 
will be assessed acco rding to the standards presented in Table 5. It is important to note that an 
AE of severe intensity may not necessarily be considered serious (refer to SAE criteria in Section  7.2.1.2).  
The intensity of AEs and SAEs related to CRS and ICANS will be assessed based on the ASTCT grading and management recommendations (see Table 7 and Table 8, respecti vely). 
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.

bedridden.  
Source: NCI CTCAE, version 5.0 ( NCI CTCAE, 2018 ). 
7.2.3. Relationship to study treatment 
An investigator must make the determination of relationship to the investigational product for 
each AE (“related” or “not related”) according to the definitions and guidance provided in 
Table 6. The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study treatment. If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not related.” If 
there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause- and-effect 
relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE 
should be considered “related.” 
Table 6: Relationship assessment definitions  
Relationship assessment  Definition/guidance  
Not related  
 Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a time to drug intake that 
makes a relationshi p unlikely; is more likely explained by disease o r 
other drugs. 
Related  Event or laboratory test abnormality with reasonable time relationship 
to treatment administration that makes a relationship likely.  
Unlikely to be attributed to disease or other medications.  
7.2.4. Recording AEs  
AEs spontaneously reported by the subject  and/or in response to an open question from the study 
staff or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the study center. Abnormal 
values that constitute an AE or lead to discontinuation of the administration of the study 
treatment must be reported and recorded as an AE. The AE term should be reported in standard 
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021) 
63 medical terminology when possible. For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the 
onset (date and time), resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, outcome, and whether it caused the study participant to discontinue the study. 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria presented in Section  7.2.2. An AE of severe 
intensity may or may not be considered serious.  
7.2.5. Reporting AEs  
The sponsor is responsible for notifying both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory 
agencies about th e safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The sponsor will 
comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB,  and investigators. 
The IND safety reports must be prepared f or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(SUSARs) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary.  
An investigator who receives a safety report describing an SAE or other specific safety 
information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and file it along 
with the IB and notify the IRB, if appropriate, according to local requirements. 
Expedited reporting to the FDA will be conducted for the following types of AEs: 
• SUSAR  
• Serious adverse reaction  
• Death regardless of attribution if it occurs within 30 days of the infusion of the study 
treatment  
• Grade ≥4 PBCAR20A -related infusion reactions  
• Any ICANS or CRS event that reaches the definition of DLT (see Section  3.8) 
7.2.6. Disease -related events and/or disease-related outcomes that do not qualify as 
AEs or SAEs  
Disease-related events (DREs) that are common in the study population, i.e., study subject s with 
r/r NHL or r/r CLL/SLL, can be serious and life-threatening (shown below). However, because 
these events are typically associated with the disease under study and with prior treatment, they 
may not be reported as individual case safety reports even though the event may be listed in the 
study reference safety information. These events will be recorded in the corresponding eCRF page in the study participant’s eCRF during the study.  
DREs and prior treatment- related events:  
• Progression of the underlying disease. 
• Cytopenias related to bone marrow involvement due to the underlying disease, 
including thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, lymphope nia. 
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021) 
64 • Infections associated with disease- related immunodeficiencies and due to extensive 
prior chemotherapy of the underlying disease. These include fever and bacterial, 
fungal, and viral infections. These infections may develop at various sites, but most 
typically develop in blood (bacteremia, fungemia), lungs (pneumonia), urinary tract (urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis), and skin and soft tissues. These infections 
may be caused by opportunistic pathogens, e.g., aspergillosis, pneumocystis, herpes 
simplex, and herpes zoster infections.  
• Bleeding related to thrombocytopenia or a bleeding diathesis including bleeding in the CNS, lungs, or other sites. 
NOTE: However, the event must be recorded as an SAE and not a DRE if  investigator 
considers that there is a reasonable possib ility that the event was related to the study 
treatment  based on greater intensity, frequency, or duration than expected for the individual 
study participant. 
Such an event will then be assessed for expedited reporting and reported within regulatory timelines if it meets the IND Safety Reporting criteria per 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312.32.  
DREs will be assessed at least monthly to determine if there is a greater incidence of any DRE 
than would be expected from historical rates in study subject s with r/r NHL, r/r CLL, and 
r/r SLL. If such an imbalance is identified, the case series will be reported as an IND Safety Report per 312 CFR 312.32. 
7.2.7. Pregnancy  
Details of all pregnancies in female study subjects and, if indicated, female partners of male 
study subject s will be collected throughout the study (through Day 360). 
If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 1. 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE; however, complications of pregnancy or certain 
pregnancy outcomes may constitute an AE. Contraceptive failure attributed to the investigational product may be an AE. 
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriag e, elective termination, normal birth, or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the study participant was 
discontinued from the study. 
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects will be considered SAEs. Spontaneous 
miscarriages should also be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs. 
7.3. Management of CRS, ICANS, and  GvHD  
Once discharged from the study center or hospital, study subject s will be advised to maintain  
ready access to a caregiver and health care facilities (recommend access to treating hospital within 30 minutes of driving) through Day 28 in the event of a medical emergency.  
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021) 
65 Educational material will be provided to each study participant/caregiver to monitor for possible 
signs of CRS, ICANS, and GvHD at home, along with instructions to contact the study center or local hospital as needed.  
7.3.1. CRS  
CRS is identi fied based on clinical presentation. Investigators will evaluate and treat other causes 
of fever, h ypoxia, and hypotension. Key manifestations include high fever, lower than normal 
blood pressure, difficulty breathing, and may be associated with hepatic, r enal, and cardiac 
dysfunction, and coagulopathy. Risk factors for severe CRS are high pre-infusion tumor burden (>50% blasts in bone marrow), uncontrolled or accelerating tumor burden following lymphodepleting chemotherapy, active infections, and/or inflammatory processes. Infusion of 
PBCAR20A should be delayed if the study participant has unresolved se rious adverse reactions 
from preceding chemotherapy or worsening tumor burden. CRS is associated with significantly 
elevated cytokines including interleukin (IL) -10, IL -6, and interferon (IFN)- ɣ. In subjects  with 
CRS, IL -6 levels are elevated during maximal T -cell proliferation. Targeting IL -6 by using IL-6 
inhibitor tocilizumab showed rapid reversal of CRS in subjects  treated with CAR T cells and 
blinatumomab  (Teachey et al, 2013 ). Tocilizumab (Actemra®) IV injection has been approved 
for the treatment of CAR T cell-induced severe or life-threatening CRS in subjects  2 years of age 
or older.  
In this study, study subject s will be closely monitored for CRS and managed according to 
severity defined by the ASTCT consensus grading ( Lee et al, 2019 ). The CRS grading and 
management recommendations are outlined in Table 7; complete ASTCT CRS consensus 
grading is provided in Table  14. Treatment with tocilizumab, or a combination of tocilizumab 
and corticosteroids if indicated, will be provided if CRS is suspected. Study subjects  who 
experience Grade 2 or higher CRS (e.g., hypotension that is not responsive to fluids, or hypoxia requirin g supplemental oxygenation) should be monitored with continuous cardiac telemetry and 
pulse oximetry. For study subject s experiencing severe CRS, consider performing an ECHO to 
assess cardiac function. For severe or life -threatening CRS, consider intensive care supportive 
therapy.

of CRS after first dose, up to 3 additional doses may be administered with at least 8 hours between consecutive 
doses.  
7.3.2. ICANS  
ICANS, which can be fatal or life-threatening, has been observed following administration of 
anti-CD20 CAR T therapies. In the majority of cases, ICANS oc curs within the first 8  weeks 
following CAR T-cell infusion and can be concurrent with CRS. The most common symptoms 
include headache, encephalopathy, tremor, dizziness, delirium, aphasia, insomnia, and anxiety. 
Study subjects  should be monitored for signs and symptoms of ICANS for 4 weeks after 
administration of PBCAR20A infusion and treated promptly if indicated; ASTCT ICANS 
grading and management guidelines are outlined in Table 8  (Lee et al, 2019 ). Complete ASTCT 
ICANS consensus grading is provided in Table 15 . Other causes of neurologic symptoms should 
be ruled out. Study subjects  with Grade ≥2 ICANS should be monitored with continuous cardiac 
telemetry and pulse oximetry. Intensive care support should be provided for study subject s with 
severe or life-threatening ICANS, and best care should be provided according to the 
investigato r’s experience. Investigators should consider non-sedating, anti- seizure medicines 
(e.g., levetiracetam) for seizure prophylaxis for Grade ≥2 ICANS.

Study subjects  who develop GvHD will be assigned a single grade based on organ involvement 
and severity according to Jacobsohn and Vogelsang (2007)  (Table 9). Whenever possible, the 
clinical diagnosis of a GvHD should be confirmed by biopsy of an affected end organ, and other 
complications affecting the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract should be ruled out by appropriate testing.

Treatment for GvHD should follow the established institution al guidelines or the consensus by 
National Institutes of Health ( Carpenter et al, 2015) (Table 10 ). Decisions to begin treatment 
depend not only on the severity of GvHD manifestations but also on the rate of progression. 
Rapidly progressing GvHD manifestations require prompt treatment ( Martin et al, 2012).

8. ASSESSMENTS OF CLINICAL ACTIVITY 
8.1. Assessment of response  
Blood samples will be drawn from study subject s at time points indicated in Table 2 to measure 
complete blood count (CBC), WBC with differenti als, and CAR T cells. The criteria for response 
are outlined below. 
MRD assessment will be performed at Screening for all study subject s. The MRD assessment 
method and status for study subject s with a CR will be determined as clin ically indicated using 
flow cytometry, qPCR, Next Generation Sequencing, or by local institutional standard. 
Acceptable samples for MRD assessment include BMA or PBMCs for study subject s with CLL, 
plasma for study subject s with DLBCL, and PBMCs for study s ubject s with NHL (includin g 
SLL). Further details for sample preparation and shipping are specified in the Laboratory 
Manual.  
NHL  
The response criteria for local and central assessments of study subject s with NHL are based on 
the revised Lugano classificat ion (Cheson et al, 2016), which incorporates PET- CT (Table 11). 
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021)  
72 The PET-CT scan or CT scan for study subjects without PET-avid tumors will be performed for 
NHL study subject s at time points specified in  the study schedules , Section  3.2.

Complete  Complete metabolic response.   
Lymph nodes a nd 
extralymphatic sites  Score 1, 2, or 3 with or without a residual mass on 5PS.  
It is recognized that in Waldeyer’s ring or extranodal sites with high 
physiologic uptake or with activation within spleen or marrow (e.g., with chemotherapy or myeloid colony-stimulating factors), uptake may be greater 
than normal mediastinum and/or liver. In this circumstance, complete 
metabolic response may be inferred if uptake at sites of initial involvement is 
no greater than surrounding normal tissue even if the tissue has high physiologic uptake. 
New lesions  None. 
Bone marrow No evidence of F DG-avid disease in marrow.  
Partial Partial metabolic response.  
Lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites  Score 4 or 5 with reduced uptake compared with Baseline and residual mass(es) of any size.  
At interim, these findings suggest responding disease. 
At end o f treatment, these findings indicate residual disease.  
New lesions  None. 
Bone marrow Residual uptake higher than uptake in normal marrow but reduced compared 
with Baseline (diffu se uptake compatible with reactive changes from 
chemotherapy allowed). If there are persistent focal changes in the marrow in 
the context of a nodal response, consideration should be given to further 
evaluation with MRI or biopsy or an interval scan.  
No response or 
stable disease  No metabolic response.  
Target nodes/nodal 
masses, extranodal 
lesions Score 4 or 5 with no significant change in FDG uptake from Baseline at interim or end of treatment.  
New lesions  None. 
Bone marrow No change from Baseline. 
Progressive disease  Progressive metabolic disease.  
Individual target nodes/nodal masses  Score 4 or 5 with an increase in intensity of uptake from Baseline and/or new foci compatible with lymphoma.

8.2. Expansion, persistence, and phenotype of PBCAR20A 
For exploratory purposes and to understand basic PK and pharmacodynamic properties, 
including persistence, PBCAR20A cells will be measured in whole blood, tumor tissue and bone 
marrow specimens using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and flow cytometry by the central laboratory, if available.  
The phenotype of PBCAR20A cells in blood, tumor tissue and bone marrow samples will be evaluated by flow cytometry evaluating the expression of markers of T- cell matu ration such as 
CD45RO and CD45RA, CCR7 or CD62L, CD25, and HLA- DR. 
Instructions for blood sample collection and tumor tissue or bone marrow samples (when available) and shipping to the central laboratory will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
8.3. CRS biomarkers 
Thirty cytokines and other potential markers for CAR toxicities, including IFN- γ, IL -6, and CRP 
(through Day 28) in blood s amples will be quantified using a multiplex 
electrochemiluminescence assay (Cytokine Panel 1, Chemokine Panel 1, and Proinflammatory Panel 1 from Meso Scale Discovery) enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay at the time points 
noted in the study schedules , Section 3.2. 
Most exploratory analyses are performed by the central laboratory and a select few will be performed at local laboratories; instructions for collecting and shipping whole blood samples for exploratory testing are described in the Laboratory Manual. 
8.4. PET- CT scan  
PET-CT scan should be performed at least 7 days prior to study treatments. If the scan is performed as a part of routine care, the resul t will be obtained from the subject’s  physician or 
medical recor d. 
A PET -CT scan on Day 14 is optional and will be determined by the investigator. Whenever 
possible, the CT scan performed as part of the PET-CT scan should be of diagnostic quality (performe d with contrast and with slice thickness ≤5 mm). If the CT scan performed in the 
PET-CT scan is not of diagnostic quality, a diagnostic quality CT scan is required to be performed at the same time as the PET -CT scan.  
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021)  
75 8.5. BMA /bone marrow  biopsy  and analysis  
Bone marrow aspiration (BMA) and /or biopsy (unless clinically contra- indicated, or against 
institutional guidelines) should be performed during the Screening Period before 
lymphodepletion to determine if cytopenias are related to leukemic infiltration of the marrow in study subject s with CLL/SLL.  
On Day 28, BMA and biopsy (unless clinically contra-indicated) should be performed to measure the tumor burden and to assess the presence of PBCAR20A cells in bone marrow in all CLL/SLL study subject s according to the timepoints indicated in the study schedule in 
Section  3.2. A marrow biopsy is mandatory to confirm a CR in CLL/SLL subject s (see 
Section  3.2).  During study visits at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months or at the time of disease relapse, 
BMA and biopsy (unless clinically contra- indicated) will be performed in all subject s with 
previous evidence of bone marrow disease and if it is clinically indicated .  
The BMAs /biopsies will be analyzed using smears and flow cytometry by the local laboratories. 
If BMA /biopsy samples are available and sent to the central laboratory, they will be tested for 
the pre sence of PBCAR20A.  
In addition, the bone marrow aspirates collected at each time point will be analyzed by the central laboratory for MRD in study subject s with CLL/SLL with a CR (see Section  8.1).  
8.6. Tumor biopsy  
Core needle biopsies (ideally 4 will be obtained) may be performed in study subject s with mass 
lesions at any time at least 14 days post-treatment and/or as clinically indicated. For lymph nodes, an excisional biopsy is preferred.  
A tumor biopsy may be performed to confirm imaging changes as clinically indicated. 
Additional biopsies may be performed pending Sponsor approval. Any tumor tissue that remains 
following a biopsy may be sen t to the central laboratory. Please consult the Laboratory Manual 
for specific sample requirements  and shipping information. 
9. STATISTICS  
9.1. General statistical met hods  
This is a Phase 1/2a, multicenter, nonrandomized, single-dose, open- label study that will employ 
the 3 + 3 dose- escalation ( Phase 1 ) design and subsequent dose expansion ( Phase 2a).  
Results of statistical analyses, descriptive statistics will be prese nted by PBCAR20A Phase 1 
Dose or by Phase 2 Arm . In addition, descriptive statistics will be calculated for subject s across 
all PBCAR20A Phase 1 dose levels.  Supporting listings will be sorted by Phase, Subject  ID and 
Dose /Arm.  
Statistical analysis for all safety and efficacy parameters will be primarily descriptive in nature. 
Categorical variables will be summarized by frequency distributions (number and percentages of 
study subject s). Continuous variables will be summarized by mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, maximum, and time -to-event variables will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier 
methods and figures for the estimated median time. No formal statistical hypothesis testing is 
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021)  
76 planned; however, if exploratory analyses are conducted and confidence intervals (CIs) are 
provided for estimates, the 95% CIs are consistent with a 2-sided 5% significance level. All 
analyses, summaries, and listings will be performed using SAS® (Cary, North Carolina) software (version 9.4 or higher).  
A detailed methodology for summary and statistical analysis of the data collected in this study 
will be documented in an SAP that will be finalized prior to database lock. The SAP may modify the data analysis plans outlined in the protocol; any modifi cations will be clearly docu mented in 
the SAP. Any major modifications of the study design or study endpoints and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.  
9.2. Sample size considerations  
Phase 1  (dose escalation): 
Subjects  will be enrolle d in dose groups with 3 to 6 subject s for each dose. Dose escalation of 
PBCAR20A will follow a standard 3 + 3 design with sequential groups of 3 subject s treated with 
incrementally higher doses of PBCAR20A until a DLT is observed and the MTD is established 
(see Section  3.1). Per the standard oncology 3 + 3 Phase 1 dose-escalation design, the total 
number of subject s to be enrolled cannot be precisely determined because the sample size is 
dependent upon the observed safety profile, which will determine the number of subjects per 
dose group and the number of dose escalations required to achieve the MTD.  
For Phase 1 , 4 dose levels  may be tested . It is anticipated that approximately 9-30 study subject s 
will be required to reach the MTD .  
Phase 2 a (dose expansion):  
Enrollment in Phase 2a will begin once the MTD has been determined in Phase 1. A sample of 
20 subjects per Arm will evaluate clinical benefit and further characterize safety and  
pharmacologic properties in specific populations of subj ects and allow for the estimation of an 
ORR within 22% using a 95% CI. 
A total of up to 60 subjects will be enrolled for Phase 2a dose optimization. The dat a collected 
from subjects enrolled in the dose expansion will be used to confirm safety, explore pot ential 
biomarkers, and evaluate potential signals of activity of PBCAR20A. Under Simon’s two stage the minimax design calculation in nQuery, assuming the mi nimum 
meaningful clinical response rate is defined as 40% versus maximum ineffective rate of 15%, a 
sample size of 19 is required to test a null hypothesis of H₀: π ≤ 0.15 versus an alternative hypothesis of H₁: π ≥ 0.4 with a one -sided significance level of 0.05 and 81.32% power, where π 
is the true proportion of response.  
If the number of responses is less than or equal to 1 out of 9 subjects in the first stage then the 
Arm will be stopped. If the Arm proceeds to the second stage, 19 subjects in total will be needed for evaluation. If 5 or less responses are observed, then that dose is rejected. 
For sa fety, the probabilities of observing at least 1 AE given the true event rate are shown in 
Table 13.

Version 5.0 (10FEB2021)  
78 9.4.3. Concomitant medications 
The number and proportion of study subject s using different concomitant medications will be 
tabulated and summarized by the World Health Organization Drug Anatomical Therapeutic 
Chemical and preferred term (PT).   
9.4.4. Treatment administration/compliance 
Study treatment administration s (include both LD and PBCAR20A) will be listed for each 
subject with drug name, dosing day, dose and number of cells for PBCARCD20A  with 
compliance information, and summarized by Dose, and by Arm for each phase. 
9.5. Safety analysis 
All subject s who receive at least one dose study treatment (any dose of LD regimen or 
PBCAR20A ) will be included in the summaries and listings of safety data. All analyses will be 
descriptive.  
9.5.1. AEs 
The AEs will be  classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
classification system version 20.0 or higher. The severity of the toxicities will be graded 
according to the NCI CTCAE version 5.0. 
In all summaries, emphasis will be placed on TEA Es, namely those with initial onset or those 
that worsen in severity after the first dose of PBCAR20A. The AEs will be summarized by the 
frequency of study subjects experiencing TEAEs corresponding to body systems and the MedDRA PT and by worst NCI CTCAE (version 5.0) grade. Summaries will also be provided of 
treatment -related TEAEs, namely those judged by the investigator to be related or likely related 
to PBCAR20A .  
The SAEs, AEs Grade ≥3, and AEs resulting in discontinuation of PBCAR20A treatment, 
withdrawal from the study, and deaths occurring during the study will be tabulated. 
All DLTs in Phase 1  will be summarized and listed by PBCAR20A  dose.  
All AESIs, as defin ed in Section  7.2.1.3, and infections will be assessed and analyzed separately 
from AEs from the administration of PBCAR20A  to end of study participation.  
9.5.2. Laboratory tests 
Laboratory data will be summarized for th e observed values at each scheduled assessment, 
together with the corresponding changes from Baseline (the value obtained prior to dosing on 
Day 1) using descriptive statistics.  
For those analytes with CTCAE version 5.0 severity criteria, abnormal laboratory values will be 
summarized by shift tables displaying numerical values and percentages classified by Baseline 
grade (i.e., grade prior to dosing on Day 1) and maximum grade on treatment. All laboratory data 
will be presented in listings. 
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021)  
79 9.5.3. ECGs  
The ECG pa rameters (PR interval, QRS duration, QT, QTc, and QTcF) will be summarized 
descriptively by Dose  or by Arm and overall. 
9.5.4. Vital signs and physical examination findings 
Vital signs data will be summarized using descrip tive statistics by the observed valued at each 
scheduled assessment and the corresponding changes from Baseline. 
Physical examination findings will be presented in data listings.  
9.6. Efficacy analysis  
Since the primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of 
PBCAR20A, an appropriate dose to optimize safety and efficacy, and to optimize the treatment 
regimen, an estimation approach will be applied to efficacy data analyses. ORR to treatment with 
PBCAR20A through Day 360 will be noted using the Lugano criteria for NHL and iwCLL for 
CLL/SLL ( Section  8.1). The ORR is defined as the proportion of study subject s meeting the 
definition of response ( PR+CR for both Phase 1 and 2a Arm C NHL s and PR+CR for Phase 1 
CLL/SLL subtype). The ORR will be summarized by number and percentage of subject s meeting 
the defin ition of ORR along with the corresponding exact 95% CIs for all Phase 1 dose level and 
for Phase 2a Arm B and C, where CR with corresponding exact 95% CI will be presented for Phase 2a Arm A.  
DoR, defined as the duration (days) from initial response to disease relapse or progression or 
death; PFS, defined as the duration (days) from Day 0 to disease relapse, progression, or death 
will be descriptively analyzed using Kaplan- Meier meth ods. Exploratory efficacy analyses 
include changes from Baseline in CBC counts, CAR T cells, cytokines, and CRP levels, and the 
number of subject s who have received allogene ic stem cell transplant. Exploratory efficacy 
endpoints and detailed analyses will be included in the SAP.  
9.7. Interim analysis  
A formal  interim analys is is planned for the Phase 1  data when the last subject completed the 
study.  
Dose escalation investigator calls consisting of the investigators, the medical monitor, and 
sponsor representative(s) will provide safety oversight during the study. The group will review safety data at regular intervals to discuss any unexpected significant toxicities and to determine whether dose escalation is appropriate.

Appendix 1. Contraceptive guidance and collection of pregnancy information 
Definitions  
Woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) 
A WOCBP is defined as any woman who is not postmenopausal or who has not had a 
hysterectomy. Postmenopausal is defined as being over the age of 55 and not having had a 
menstrual period for at least 1 year. 
Contraception guida nce 
Male study subject s 
Male study subject s with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if 
they agree to ONE of the following during the study treatment period (Day 0 through Day 90):  
• Are abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifestyle 
(abstinent on a long- term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent  
• Agree to  use a male condom plus partner use of a highly effective contraceptive 
method when having penile- vaginal intercourse with a WOCBP who is not currently 
pregnant. 
In addition, male study subject s must refrain from donating sperm for the duration of the study. 
Male study subject s with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain abstinent from 
penile-vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each episode of penile penetration during the study treatment period. 
Female study subjects 
Female st udy subjects of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use a 
highly effective method of contraception. 
Highly effective contraceptive method  
At least 1 of the methods below should be used in combination with male condoms:  
• Combined (estrogen- and progesterone-containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, delivered orally, intravaginally, or transdermally.  
• Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, delivered orally, via injection, or implanted.  
• An intrauterine device.  
• An intrauterine hormone- releasing system.  
Pregnancy testing  
The WOCBP should only be included after a negative pregnancy test at screening.  
Pregnancy test will be performed whenever a menstrual  cycle is missed or when pregnancy is 
otherwise suspected.  
Protocol PBCAR20A-01  Precision Biosciences, Inc.  
Version 5.0 (10FEB2021)  
89 Collection of pregnancy information

The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male study participant’s 
female par tner who becomes pregnant while the male study participant is in this study. This 
applies only to male study subject s who receive PBCAR20A. 
After obtai ning the necessary signed ICF from the pregnant female partner directly, the 
investigator will record pre gnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the 
sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the sponsor. Generally, the follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 
8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be 
reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or i ndication for the 
procedure.  
Female study subjects who become pregnant  
The investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female study participant who becomes pregnant while participating in this study. Information will be recorded on the 
appropriate form and submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of a study participant's 
pregnancy. The study participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The investigator will collect follow -up information on the study participant and the neonate and 
the information will be forwarded to the sponsor. Generally, follow-up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status  (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the 
procedure. 
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion is 
always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any poststudy pregnancy- related 
SAE considered reasonably related to the study intervention by the investigator will be reported 
to the sponsor as described in Section  7.2.5. While the investigator is not obligated to actively 
seek this information in former study subject s, he or she may learn of an SAE through 
spontaneous reporting.  
Any female study participant who becomes pregnant after receiving PBCAR 20A wi ll be 
followed through after giving birth or after the pregnancy is terminated.

such as tocilizumab or steroids, fever is no longer required to grade subsequent CRS severity. In this case, CRS grading is driven by hypotension and/or 
hypoxia.  
b CRS grade is determined by the more severe event: hypotension or hypoxia not attributable to any other cause. For example, a patient with a temperature of 
39.5°C, hypotension requiring 1 vasopressor, and hypoxia requiring low -flow nasal cannula is classified as Grade 3 CRS.  
c Low-flow nasal cannula is defined as oxygen delivered at ≤6 L/min. Low flow also includes blow -by oxygen delivery, sometimes used in pediatrics. High- flow 
nasal cannula is defined as oxygen delivered at >6 L/min.

Overall 
study design  This is a Phase 1/2a, 
nonrandomized, open- label,

safety and clinical activity of 
PBCAR20A in adults with r/r 
CD20
+ B-cell NHL (Cohort A) or 
r/r CD20+ CLL/SLL (Cohort B).  This is a Phase 1/2a, nonrandomized,

expansion study to evaluate the safety 
and clinical activity of PBCAR20A in 
adults with r/r CD20+ B-cell NHL 
including r/r CD20+ CLL/SLL. 
Starting with protocol version 4.0, as all 
subjects enrolled to date have been 
NHL subjects, the Phase 1 portion of 
the study will continue to enroll and 
treat all subjects as one cohort. The 
Phase 2 portion of the study will enroll 
two separate cohorts, 1 for NHL 
subjects and 1 for CLL/SLL subjects.

For characterization of the 
pharmacology, safety profile, and 
clinical benefit profile, up to 18 subjects 
total may be enrolled in any given dose 
level for which safety has been 
established (i.e., ≤1 of 6 subjects 
experiences a DLT). These addition al

3.7, 
Retreatment criteria  New section added.  
Retreatment refers to the specific 
scenario in which a subject receives all 
planned treatment and has some 
evidence of benefit followed by 
evidence of disease progression.  
All subjects will receive PBCAR20A as 
per the Schedule  of Activities (SoA; 
Table 2). A subject may receive an 
additional dose of PBCAR20A if he/she 
meets retreatment criteria as determined 
by the investigator and agrees to be 
retreated.  
Subjects are eligible for retreatment 
only if the following criteria are  met: 
• Subject has documented evidence 
of tumor response to initi al dose of 
PBCAR20A followed by documented 
disease progression at subsequent visit.  
• Subject has biopsy- proven CD20+ 
tumor at progression. 
• Subject has no evidence of GvHD 
and no new disea se-related central 
nervous system (CNS) involvement. 
• Subject has adequate bone marrow, 
renal, hepatic, pulmonary, and cardiac 
function as defined in Section 4.1. 
• Subject has not received another 
systemic treatment for NHL.  
Subjects who meet the retreat ment 
criteria and have had a study visit 
within 30 days will under go 
lymphodepletion chemotherapy and 
follow the SoA from the beginning. 
Subjects who meet the retreatment 
criteria and have discontinued the study 
will need to be re -enrolled into an open 
slot (Phase 1 or Phase 2a). Retreatment 
visits, starting from lymphod epletion 
visits, will be distinguished from initial 
visits in the electronic case report form 
(eCRF).  
Subjects eligible for retreatment may 
receive PBCAR20A at the highest dose 
level with es tablished safety (see 
Section 3.1). New addition

in each dose group (including the 
dose de-escalation group, i.e., 
Dose 1) will be observed for 14 days for safety before any 
subsequent study participant 
receives any study treatment to provide an adequate safety

suspending treatment  In addition to the 14-day 
staggered dosing schedule between the first 2 study 
participants in each dose group 
(including the dose de -escalation 
group if applicable), dosing in all 
study participants, regardless of 
cohort and dose group, will temporarily stop if any of the following events occur:  
• Grade 4 toxicities related to 
CRS  
• Grade ≥3 GvHD  
• Any death that is possibly or 
probably related to the study treatment  In addition to the staggered dosing schedule (28 days between the first 
2 study participants and 14 days 
between the second and third study 
participant in each dose group, 
including the dose de- escalation 
group if applicable), dosing in all study participants, regardless of cohort and dose group, will

STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. 
Patients with T2D will be included in this study if at Screening they have 
a HbA1c level between 7% and 11%, inclusive, and severe renal 
impairment (defined as a screening modification of diet in renal disease 
[MDRD] eGFR of ≥15 to <30 mL/min/1.73 m2). Any background 
antidiabetic therapy (oral or injected including insulin) is permitted with 
the exception of other sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) 
inhibitors. During the double-blind Treatment Period, the type and the 
dose of background therapy should not be changed unless for safety concerns. 
All patients will have a Screening Period comprised of an up to 2-week 
Screening Phase and a 2-week, single- blind placebo Run-in Phase prior 
to randomization. In order to qualify for randomization, patients must demonstrate compliance during the si ngle-blind placebo Run-in Phase 
based upon tablet count ( ≥80%) and as assessed at the Investigator’s 
discretion. 
Randomization will be stratified by: 
• HbA1c at screening ( ≤8.5% and >8.5%)  
• SBP at screening (<130 mmHg and ≥130 mmHg). 
To ensure safety, all randomized patients will be monitored weekly for 
their laboratories and safety for the first 4 weeks. When 10 patients in 
each group are exposed for 4 weeks there will be a formal evaluation by Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). 
Following randomization, patients will have a 26-week double-blind 
Treatment Period, a 26-week double-blind Extension Period, and a 4-week, post-treatment Follow-up Visit to collect safety information. 
Patients will be monitored throughout the double-blind Treatment Period and Extension Period for signs of deterioration in renal function (eg, 
decrease in eGFR) as well as other routine clinical and laboratory 
findings (see Study Flowchart, Section  1.2). If at any visit after 
randomization up to Week 8 there is a rise in creatinine level (ie, >50% increase from baseline level, where baseline level is defined as the mean of creatinine values obtained at Screening and Randomization) or

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 5 if at any visit after Week 8 there is a rise of >50% above the mean of 
creatinine values from the previous 2 visits, the Investigator should 
ensure that no reasonable explanation exists for creatinine increase and in particular the following causes: 
• Medications that increase creatinine 
• Decrease in cardiac output 
• Obstructive uropathy 
• Urinary tract infection 
• Volume depletion 
If addressing these causes does not reduce the creatinine level below the above stated threshold, the inve stigational medicinal product (IMP) 
will be stopped for 2 weeks. If at creatinine recheck the patient has returned to below the threshold, then IMP will be restarted at a reduced 
dose (ie, dose reduced via interact ive response technology (IRT) to 
200 mg for those randomized to 400 mg; maintained to 200 mg for 
those randomized to 200 mg, and to placebo for those randomized to 
placebo). If the creatinine does not return to below the threshold, the 
IMP will be permanently discontinued but the patient will be asked to 
continue attending all study visits.  
Patients will be randomly assigned 1:1:1 to 1 of 3 treatment groups: 
A. Placebo; 
B. Sotagliflozin 200 mg 
C. Sotagliflozin 400 mg 
The HbA1c and FPG results will be masked to study sites and patients 
after randomization and until study end. To prevent partial unblinding, 
UGE and urine glucose:creatinine ratio (UGCR) results will be also 
masked to study sites and patients.  
Additionally, urinalysis by dipstick  will not include the measurement of 
urine glucose. Quantitative urine glucose, albumin, calcium, and 
creatinine will be measured separately at selected on-site visits by the 
central laboratory. 
Early Termination 
If a patient discontinues treatment with IMP early during the Treatment 
Period, the patient will have a Premature end of treatment (EOT) Visit, 
and a Follow-up Visit 4 weeks after the last dose of IMP. In addition, every effort will be made to have all patients return to the site at the time 
corresponding to their scheduled visits , particularly the Weeks 26 and 
52 visits.  
If the patient does not agree to site visits, they will be contacted by 
telephone to enquire about safety status, particularly at the time of the initially scheduled end of study. 
The study design is presented graphically in Section  1.1.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 8 mmol/L) or HbA1c ≥8.5%  (the 8.5% criterion does not apply if 
the HbA1c decrease from Baseline was ≥1.0%). 
Routine fasting (SMBG will be pres ented as equivalent self-monitoring 
plasma glucose [SMPG]) and central lab alerts on FPG (and HbA1c at 
Week 12 and onwards) are set up to ensure that glycemic parameters 
remain under predefined threshol ds values (see hereinafter). 
• If one fasting SMBG value exceeds the specific glycemic limit 
on one day, the patient checks it again during the 2 following 
days. If all the values in 3 consecutive days exceed the specific limit, the patient should contact the Investigator and a 
central laboratory FPG measurement (and HbA1c at Week 
12 and onwards)  is performed as soon as possible, 
preferably within 7 days to confirm the hyperglycemia. 
• Upon receipt of a central laboratory rescue alert a central 
laboratory re-test must be completed and confirmed as exceeding the criterion  for rescue before rescue therapy is 
initiated. The re-test confirmation should be performed as soon as possible, but within 7 days of receipt by unscheduled visit. 
In case of a confirmatory FPG and/or HbA1c above the threshold values, the Investigator should ensure that no reasonable explanation exists for 
insufficient glucose control, and in particular that: 
• The increased FPG has been tested at a fasting status (ie, no food intake for ≥8 hours) 
• Investigational product is given at the planned dose 
• There is no intercurrent disease, which may jeopardize glycemic control (eg, infectious disease) 
• Compliance to treatment is appropriate 
• Compliance to diet and lifestyle is appropriate. 
If any of the above can reasonably explain the insufficient glycemic 
control, Investigator should consider not initiating rescue medication and 
the Investigator should undertake appropriate action, ie: 
• Assess plasma glucose in fasting condition (ie, after at least 8 hours fast) 
• Initiate an evaluation and treatment of intercurrent disease (to be reported in adverse event [AE]/concomitant medication parts 
of the electronic case repor t form [e-CRF] and the medical 
record) 
• Stress on the absolute need to be compliant with treatment 
• Organize a specific interview with the patient and a Registered 
Dietician or other qualified nutrition professional and to reinforce 
on the absolute need to be compliant to diet and lifestyle recommendations, and schedule an FPG/HbA1c assessment at 
the next visit  
If none of the above mentioned reasons can be found, or if appropriate 
action fails to decrease FPG/HbA1c under the threshold values, rescue 
medication may be introduced.  
• Open label rescue medication(s) to treat hyperglycemia must be in accordance with local standard of care and prescribing 
practice for patients with CKD and will be at the discretion of the

ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE See Study Flow Chart, Section  1.2. 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Sample size determination: The sample size/power calculations were performed based on the 
primary endpoint. Assuming a common standard deviation of 1.2% and 
using a 2-sided test at a 0.05 α-level, 92 patients in each group will 
provide at least 80% power to detect a treatment difference of 0.5% in 
mean HbA1c change from Baseline to Week 26 between sotagliflozin 
400 mg and placebo. 
Analysis population: 
Efficacy analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, 
defined as all randomized patients irrespective of compliance with the 
study protocol and procedures. Patients will be analyzed according to the 
treatment group to which they are randomized.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 11 Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint: 
Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (change from Baseline to 
Week 26 in HbA1c) will be perform ed using the ITT population, using 
HbA1c measurements obtained during the study, including those 
obtained after IMP discontinuation or introduction of rescue therapy. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of c hange in HbA1c from Baseline to 
Week 26 will be analyzed with missing values imputed by control-based 
multiple imputation method under the missing not at random framework. 
• For placebo patients, missing data will be imputed based on the 
placebo group data. 
• For patients in the sotagliflozin groups, missing data will be 
imputed as if the patients were on placebo throughout the 
study, where all patients’ measurements including the 
on-treatment measurements will be considered as if the 
measurements were from the placebo group in the imputation 
model. 
Each of the complete datasets will be analyzed by the Analysis of 
Covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment groups (sotagliflozin 
400 mg, sotagliflozin 200 mg, and placebo), randomization stratum of 
Screening HbA1c ( ≤8.5% and >8.5%), randomization stratum of 
Screening SBP (<130 mmHg, ≥ 130 mmHg), country as fixed effects, 
and baseline HbA1c as a covariate. Results from each complete 
dataset will be combined to provide the adjusted mean change in 
HbA1c from Baseline to Week 26 for each treatment group as well as 
the between-group difference (comparing sotagliflozin 400 mg versus 
placebo) and its associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) using 
contrast statements. 
Summary statistics (for screening value, baseline value observed 
values, and observed changes from Baseline) at scheduled visits will be 
provided for each treatment group. The summary will include the 
number of observations, mean, standard deviation (SD), standard error 
(SE), minimum, median, and maximum. Graphical presentations will 
also be used to examine trends over time using mean values (±SE) at 
each of the scheduled visits (using observed cases). 
Baseline definition: 
The baseline value is defined genera lly as the last available value 
before the first dose of double-blind IMP or the last available value prior 
to randomization for patients who were randomized but never exposed 
to IMP. 
For serum creatinine (or eGFR), t he baseline value is defined as the 
mean of creatinine levels (or eGFR) at the Screening, and 
Randomization Visits that prior to the first dose of double-blind IMP or 
prior to randomization for patients who were randomized but never exposed to IMP. 
Analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints: 
The secondary endpoints will be analyzed using a similar approach to 
the primary efficacy endpoint, with missing values imputed by the 
control-based multiple imputation method under the missing not at 
random framework. For each of the continuous secondary endpoints, 
each of the complete datasets will be analyzed by the ANCOVA model

Week 26 (Week 12 for SBP endpoints)  for each treatment group, as 
well as the between-group difference (comparing each sotagliflozin group versus placebo) and its associated 95% CI using contrast statements. 
The UACR will be log-transformed before the analysis. Change from

percent change of UACR at Week 26 versus Baseline based on the 
geometric means as well as the corresponding 95% CIs.

Week 26 will be analyzed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method 
stratified by randomization stratum of HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%), and 
randomization stratum of SBP (<130 mmHg, ≥130 mmHg). For the 
HbAc1 <7% or <6.5% analysis, patients with missing HbA1c data at Week 26 will be considered non-re sponders in the ITT population. 
Summary statistics for the secondary endpoints at scheduled visits will 
be provided for each treatment group. 
Analysis of other efficacy endpoints: 
The analysis of other endpoints will be descriptive with no formal 
testing. Summary statistics at scheduled visits using observed cases will be provided by each treatment group. Graphical presentations will 
also be used to illustrate trends over time. 
Analysis of safety data: 
All safety summaries will be descriptive; no statistical significance tests 
will be performed on the safety data. These analysis will; be based on 
the Safety Population, which is defined as all randomized patients who 
receive at least 1 dose of double-blind treatment, regardless of the 
amount of treatment administered. Patients will be analyzed for safety analyses according to the treatment actually received. 
DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per patient)  Up to 60 weeks, including a 4-week Screening Period (comprised of a 
2-week Screening Phase, a 2-we ek, single-blind placebo Run-in 
Phase), a 26-week double-blind Treatment Period, a 26-week double-blind Extension Period, and a 4-week post-treatment Follow-up 
Visit.

a All visits’ dates will be scheduled based on the date of randomization within visi t window allowed as per flowchart. If a patie nt discontinues treatment with investigational medicinal product (IMP) early during the 
Treatment Period, the patient will have a Premature EOT Visit (similar to Visit 13, see Section  10.1.3.2 and a Follow-up Visit 4 weeks after the last dose of IMP (similar to Visit 14, see Section  10.1.4.1). However, 
every effort will be made to have the patients return to the site for all scheduled visits, in  particular the Week 26 and Week 52 Visits. If the patient  does not agree to a site visit, they will be contac ted by telephone to 
inquire about safety status. If a patient discontinues (or completes) treatment and study at the same time, a single visit for both premature EOT and follow-up will be performed. 
b Height to be measured only at screening. 
c Vital sign measurements (sitting blood pressure [BP], heart rate temperature, and respiratory rate): 3 separate seated BP and h eart rate measurements should be taken with at least 1 minute between readings, 
following a 5-minute rest period and prior to phlebotomy (see  Section  9.2.1.5 and detailed instructions in Appendix C ). 
d The abbreviated physical exam s hould focus on cardiac and respiratory systems, as well as any areas important for assessment of  AEs if necessary. 
e Additional visit (recheck creatinine) from visit 8 every 2 weeks, contact IRT for treatment allocation if applicable. 
f Self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) is to be performed fasting, at least 3 times per week from start of Run-in until end of Treatment Period including on day of each on-site study visit except Visits 4 and 5. 
Patients will also be requested to self-asse ss blood glucose levels whenev er they experience symptom s of hypoglycemia. SMPG ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) will be documented on the hypoglycemia eCRF . The 
SMBG will be presented as equivalent self -monitoring plasma  glucose (SMPG). 
g The 12-lead ECG recordings should be obtained prior to IMP admin istration. The ECG will be evaluated  as “normal” or “abnormal”.  
h All laboratory assessments occur prior to dose of double-blind IMP. All visi t dates will be scheduled bas ed on the date of rand omization with a ±5 days visit window allowed during the treatment period. 
i Safety laboratory will include hematology and clinical  chemistry, please see the list in Table 2 .  Other clinical chemistry tests will include amylase and lipase.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 17 j Serum pregnancy testing only at screening; urine pregnancy testing subsequently. Serum pregnancy test results must be reviewed prior to beginning the Run-in Phase for all women of childbearing potential 
(WOCBP). Any positive urine test results must be confirmed based on serum pregnancy test. The Investigator may perform addition al tests at their discretion or as required by local regulations. For women of 
nonreproductive potential ( Appendix A ), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or estradiol levels should be tested if  the definition of postmenopausal or premenopa usal cannot be satisfied, eg, no medical 
document of hysterectomy or cessation of menses <12 months without an alternative medical cause. 
k Plasma concentration samples for sotagliflozin and sotagliflozin-3-O-glucuronide collected on Weeks 4, 18, 26, 39, and 52 may b e drawn with the other laboratory assessments but MUST be collected before 
administration of IMP. The time of the last intake of study drug prior to visits where PK samples are taken should be recorded by the patient in the patient diary. Patients should be reminded of this at visits 
preceding PK time points to ensure these details are captured. In the case of premature IMP discontinuation, PK samples should not be drawn at the premature EOT visit, neither at all subsequent visits. 
l An additional blood sample will be dr awn at Weeks 26 and 52 Visits at 3 hours afte r administering the dose of IMP for creatinin e (for eGFR) and for assessing plasma concentration of sotagliflozin and 
sotagliflozin-3-O-glucuronide. 
m The markers of intestinal transit and absorption include vitamins B6, B12, K, E, and A, serum folate, and ferritin. 
n Markers of bone and calcium metabolism :serum calcium , serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D, serum 1,25-d ihydroxyvitamin D, serum phospho rus , serum magnesium, serum parathyroid hormone (iPTH), markers of 
bone resorption (serum NTX, serum β-CTX-1), bone formation (serum P1NP and osteocalcin) and serum alkaline phosphatase. 
o Urinalysis includes urine dipstick and microscopy. Dipstick includes assessment of specific gravity, pH, protein, blood, ketone s, bilirubin, urobilinogen, nitrite, and leukocyt e esterase. Microscopy includes but is not 
limited to detection of formed cellular elements, casts, bacteria, yeast, parasites, and crystals in centrifuged urine sediment. In the event of abnormal urinalysis findings suspicious of urinary tract infection (UTI), 
urine culture should be performed . Positive urine culture determination will be bas ed upon the criteria of the reporting labora tory. Additionally, urine cultures should be performed if at any point the PI suspects the 
presence of a UTI. 
p Patients will collect overnight urine on Weeks 0, 2, 4, 12, 26, and 52.  In the night prior to t he visits, the ur ine before sle ep will be discarded an d the urine during sleep and the firs t morning urine (after getting up) 
will be collected. The visits s hould be rescheduled to allow for urine collection in  case a patient missed it. Urinary albumin,  total protein, creatinine, calcium (adjusted for creatinine), phosphorus (adjusted for serum 
phosphorus and creatinine), magnesium (adjusted for serum magnesium and urinary creatinine), and glucose will be assessed. 
 
  
s The 50% increase will be from baseli ne value (to Week 8) or from the arithmetic m ean of creatinine values from last 2 visits (a fter Week 8) only at visits having a measurement of creatinine. 
t All serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs, AEs of special interest  (AESIs), and events of special Interest (EOSIs) will be collect ed starting with signing informed consent and continue until the end of the study. All 
AEs that occur during treatment should be followed until study completion (or until patients leave the study) or until the even t has resolved, the condition has stabilized, or the patient is lost to follow-up. All patients 
will have a follow-up visit 4 weeks after the last dose of  IMP to collect safety and some efficacy information.

4.1 BACKGROUND: SOTAGLIFLOZIN AND DISEASE 
Sotagliflozin is a dual inhibitor of the sodium-g lucose cotransporters type 1 and 2 (SGLT1 and 
SGLT2) being developed for use in type 2 diabetes  (T2D); a metabolic disorder characterized by 
hyperglycemia that results from a combination of increased insulin resistance and beta-cell 
dysfunction ( 1). The microvascular complications of diabetes are well known and can result in 
impaired renal function, retinopath y and neuropathy and macrovas cular complications result in 
coronary disease, amputations and stroke. Other comorbidities that are frequently associated with diabetes are hypertension, obesity, and cardiovascular (CV) disease. According to the most recent 
International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Atlas, the estimates in 2015 were that  1 in 11 adults have 
diabetes, which means 415 million people and estimated to be 642 million by 2040 ( 2). 
According to the World Health Organization, th ere are about 60 million people with diabetes in 
the European Region, or about 10.3% of men a nd 9.6% of women aged 25 years and over ( 3). 
While these numbers include both people with T2 D and type 1 diabetes (T1D), over 90% of 
adults with diabetes have T2D. Diabetes is amon g the leading causes of death by disease and is a 
leading cause of heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, and amputation ( 2, 3). Despite 
the fact that the population of people with diabetes  is growing, none of the current therapies is 
curative and the results of treatment are variable. 
Despite the numerous treatment options available, monotherapy fails in many patients as beta-cell 
function continues to deteriorate leading to pr ogressively increasing hyperglycemia. Aggressive 
glycemic control with the currently available agents often leads to side effects, most notably 
weight gain and an increased fr equency of hypoglycemia. These concerns emphasize the need to 
develop new agents that effectively and sa fely lower glucose in diabetic patients ( 4). 
The SGLT1 is expressed predominantly in the gast rointestinal (GI) tract; SGLT1 is responsible 
for the majority of glucose absorption by the small intestine ( 5). Inhibition of SGLT1 in the GI 
tract delays glucose absorption and lowers  peak postprandial glucose levels ( 6). Additionally, 
there is accumulating evidence that SGLT1 inhibition stimulates secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY), gut horm ones involved in pancrea tic beta-cell function 
and appetite control, respectively. Reduced glucose absorption in the proximal intestine leads to more glucose being delivered distally, which allo ws L cells in both the ileum and the colon to 
sense glucose and its byproducts, and as a resu lt, they secrete GLP-1 and PYY. Although a 
complete lack of functional SGLT1 may be associ ated with symptoms of glucose and galactose 
malabsorption ( 7), pharmacologic inhibition of SGLT1 by sotagliflozin has not produced these 
effects in preclinical models or patients with T2 DM. Selective inhibitors of the SGLT1 transporter 
are in early stages of development. 
Extensive clinical studies conducte d for selective SGLT2 inhibitors have established this class as 
effective agents for the treatment of T2D (4, 8) and have led to approvals by the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) and the European  Medicines Agency (EMA). Studies with

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 29 sotagliflozin, a dual inhibitor of SGLT2 and SGLT1, have shown that this agent produces 
significant glucosuria in preclinical animal m odels, healthy human volunt eers, and patients with 
T2D. Single- and multiple-dose administration of sotagliflozin to healthy human patients has 
resulted in dose-dependent increases in glucosuria. Multiple-dose (28-day) administration in 
diabetic patients produced impr ovements in several metabolic parameters, including urinary 
glucose excretion (UGE, fasting plasma glucos e (FPG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), GLP-1, and 
PYY (9). These data suggest that sotagliflozin should be of therapeutic be nefit to patients with 
T2D. 
Diabetic nephropathy with advancing duration of diabetes and the treatment of T2D in the face of 
advancing renal insufficiency represents a particular challenge to the clinician. Many agents used 
to treat T2DM, including sulfonylurea, metformin, and incretin-based insulin secretagogues, can 
no longer be used or must be dosed with caution in the clinical setting of renal insufficiency. 
The glucose lowering efficacy of selective SGLT2 inhibitors will diminish when renal function 
(glomerular filtration rate) dimin ishes because SGLT2 is located exclusively in the renal tubule 
and selective SGLT2 inhibitors act solely by bl ocking reabsorption of glucose that has been 
filtered at the glomerulus ( 6). For this reason the use of dapaglif lozin is restricted to patients with 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and that of empagliflozin and 
canagliflozin is limited to patients with eGFR ≥45 ml/min/1.73 m2 (10, 11 , 12). Sotagliflozin, in 
contrast, lowers glucose by blocking absorption of  glucose in the small intestine (SGLT1) as well 
as by blocking reabsorption at the kidney (SGL T2) and thus would be expected to maintain 
glucose lowering efficacy as renal function diminishes. In fact this was shown to be the case in an early Phase 1 trial (LX4211.1-107 DM. Patients w ith T2D and either chronic kidney disease 
(CKD stage 3A (eGFR 45 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m
2) or CKD stage 3B (eGFR 30 to 
44 mL/min/1.73 m2) were randomized to sotagliflozin 400 mg once daily or placebo for 7 days 
while being closely monitore d, partly as inpatients. 
Sotagliflozin significantly reduced postprandial gl ucose (PPG) levels rela tive to placebo in the 
total population and in  patients with an eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, with a placebo-adjusted 
decrease in incremental area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) predose –4 hrs of 
73.5 mg*h/dL (p = 0.009) and 137.2 mg*h/dL (p = 0.001) for the total population and the eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m
2 subgroup, respectively.  
As expected sotagliflozin caused less increase in UGE in the CKD3B subsets than in the total population subset (placebo-subt racted increase in UGE was 38.7, 53.5, and 20.4 g/24h for the 
total population, CKD3A subset, and CKD3B subset , respectively [p = 0.007 for all 3]). This 
suggests that something other than inhibition of SGLT2 mediated renal glucose absorption is 
being inhibited by sotagliflozin, eg, SGLT1 effect  in the GI. In addition, the patients with CKD4 
have decreased insulin clearance and better glucose control. These results also suggest that dual 
SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibition with sotagliflozin c ould prove useful for th e treatment of patients 
with T2D and renal impairment ( 13). 
Sotagliflozin has shown effect in patients with renal impairmen t and since SGLT1 inhibition does 
not depend on kidney, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of sotagliflozin in 
glucose lowering in patients with severe renal impairment.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 30 4.2 CLINICAL TRIALS OF SOTAGLIFLOZIN IN HUMANS 
Approximately 840 subjects (698 assigned to so tagliflozin and 229 assigned to placebo) have 
participated in completed clinical studies of sotagliflozin. No significant safety concerns have 
been identified in the sotagliflozin drug program, and sotagliflozin has been well-tolerated in all studies to date. Serious AEs (SAE s) and discontinuations due to a dverse events (AEs) have been 
infrequent and have been balanced between tr eatment and comparator groups. Reports of 
treatment-emergent AEs (TEAE) across all sotagliflozin studies for which data are available were generally balanced between tr eatment and comparator groups. The most frequently reported 
TEAEs (≥2.0%) were headache, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness, and upper respiratory 
tract infection, all of which were reported at a frequency greater than placebo. However, the 
majority were described as mild to moderate, and most resolved spontaneously and without discontinuation of the study drug. 
In completed and ongoing clinical trials, no additi onal safety issues beside those already described 
in the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) ha ve been observed. In general, no significant 
imbalances of SAE/AEs between sotagliflozin and comparators were observed in completed 
studies. Cumulatively, across the completed studies  8 SAEs were reported in 6 patients (4 T2D 
and 2 T1D), all of which were assessed as unrelated to study drug; those reported in 4 T2D 
patients who received sotagliflozin included pulm onary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), 
bile duct stone, cholangitis and lower limb fracture, while a myocardial infarction (MI) was 
experienced by a patient receiving placebo. Tw o SAEs of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were 
reported in 2 T1D patients in the ongoing (blinded) Phase 2 T1D study LX4211.1-203-TIDM; 
both SAEs were assessed as due to failu re of insulin delivery via insulin pump. 
A drug interaction study with digoxin, a sensitive P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, indicated that sotagliflozin acts as a weak P-gp inhibitor. Base d on drug-drug interaction studies, the effect of 
sotagliflozin in competing with compounds meta bolized with cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 are 
minimal. Sotagliflozin wa s profiled as perpetrator regarding CYP3A4/5 interaction in INT14972, 
in which a weak induction of CYP3A4/5 was obs erved at a dose of 400 mg as well as a weak 
inhibition of CYP2D6. These effects were more pronounced at a higher dose of 800 mg. It was 
concluded, that for the vast majority of drug s metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4/5 or 
CYP2D6, the clinical effect is negligible. Howeve r, caution is suggested for patients treated with 
narrow therapeutic index drugs. Patients taking sotagliflozin w ith concomitant digoxin should 
have digoxin concentrations monitored and doses  reduced as needed. In addition, other P-gp 
substrates may be affected and the labels of P-gp  substrate drugs should be consulted with regards 
to monitoring and dose adjustments. 
In trial 202, it has been demonstrated the systo lic blood pressure (SBP) in all the patients was 
decreased by 5.4 mmHg compared to the placebo while the decrease in patients with SBP >130 
mmHg was 14 mmHg. More information on the safety of sotagliflozin and on the clinical program can be found in the 
IB.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 31 4.3 RATIONALE FOR SELECTION OF DOSE 
Both the 200 mg and 400 mg doses are being developed in the Phase 3 program for sotagliflozin 
for the treatment of T2D. These doses are being tested in several Phase 3 trials including the 
current trial in patient s with T2D and CKD4. 
The proposed sotagliflozin 200 mg and 400 mg once daily doses are based on the results of the 
Phase 2b study LX4211.1-202-DM. In this study doses of 75 mg once daily, 200 mg once daily, 200 mg twice daily, and 400 mg once daily sotagl iflozin were tested ove r a 12-week, double-blind 
period. The sotagliflozin 200 mg and 400 mg once daily doses were chosen for further evaluation based on their HbA1c lowering effects and the overall safety and tolerability observed at these 
doses. At 12 weeks, the 200 mg and 400 mg once daily doses lowered HbA1c by a mean of 0.52% 
and 0.93%, respectively (p <0.001 for both arms), while placebo lowered HbA1c by a mean of 
0.14%. Sotagliflozin also produced statistically si gnificant reductions in body weight (200 mg and 
400 mg doses) and SBP (400 mg dose). 
The overall incidences of AEs on sotagliflozi n 200 mg and 400 mg once daily were similar to 
placebo. A maximum dose of sotagliflozin has not been established in terms of either safety or 
HbA1c reduction. From a safety perspective, sotagliflozin was well-tolerated across studies. In healthy subjects 
sotagliflozin was well-tolerated following single doses up to  2000 mg, and in multiple doses up to 
800 mg over 10 days. Furthermore, in a thorough QT  study, single doses of sotagliflozin (800 mg 
and 2000 mg) were well-tolerated a nd did not prolong the QT interval. Additionally, evaluation of 
metabolites in urine and plasma of healthy subjects resulted in no safety concerns following single doses of 400 mg sotagliflozin. In patients with T2D, single doses of sotagliflozin 400 mg in 
combination with sitagliptin, and multiple doses up to sotagliflozin 400 mg in combination with metformin over 12 weeks were also well-tolerated. 
Based on the pharmacokinetic (PK)  extrapolation and approximation the safe ty margin based on 
400 mg multiple dosing in CKD stage 3 patients (30 ≤ eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m
2) is 3-fold and in 
CKD stage 4 patients (15 ≤eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) is 1.9-fold. 
4.4 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN AND CONTROL GROUPS 
This study is designed to demonstrate the efficacy  and safety of sotagliflozin when used as add-on 
therapy to standard care (any combination of oral agents and/or insulin deemed clinically 
appropriate) in patients with T2D and CKD stage 4 who have in adequate glycemic control. 
Sotagliflozin 200 mg daily as well as sotagliflozin 400 mg daily will be compared to placebo in 
this randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, 3-arm, parallel-group trial. Safety, tolerability, 
PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) effects of sota gliflozin are supported by Phase 1 and Phase 2 
studies and animal toxicology data in rats up to 26 weeks and dogs up to 39 weeks as well as 
2-year carcinogenicity data in rats. Efficacy and safety in patients with CKD stages 3A and 3B are 
supported by 7 day PD and sa fety data in patients with  T2D and CKD (Trial LX4211.107).

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 32 In a Phase 1 trial, 31 patients with T2D and eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were randomized to 
sotagliflozin or placebo. Despite reduction of more than 50% in  UGE, the patients with eGFR 
<45 mL/min/1.73 min2 and patients with eGFR ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2 had the same level of 
reduction in the PPG (the primary endpoint). 
Randomization will be stratified based on Screening HbA1c ( ≤8.5% versus >8.5%) and SBP 
Screening (SBP <130 mmHg versus ≥130 mmHg). Since the reduction in the SBP for patients 
with SBP >130 mmHg was significantly higher th an all the patients, these patients will be 
monitored for blood pressure (BP) reduction closely. 
A placebo control will be used to allow for an unbi ased assessment of treatment effects and safety 
data. Bias will be minimized by randomizing the patients to treatment groups, blinding the 
patients, the Investigators, and the Sponsor to  the treatment allocations, and by adjudicating 
endpoints in a blinded fashion. A 2-week Run-in phase has been implemented  to stabilize HbA1c and minimize response to 
placebo and effects inherent to participation in a controlled clinical trial. 
Sotagliflozin treatment for 26 weeks is likely to be of sufficient duration to observe effects on 
reduction of HbA1c, BP, and body weight, and is therefore selected as the timepoint for 
assessment of the primary endpoint HbA1c. Tr eatment up to 52 weeks will provide additional 
long-term data on safety and efficacy. 
Endpoints for evaluating renal function include eGFR, based on serum creatinine, and urine 
albumin to creatinine ratio as well as routine m onitoring of urine via dipstick and spot urine 
analyses. At 6 times during the trial (Baselin e, Weeks 2, 4, 12, 26, and 52) patients will be 
instructed to bring overnight urine collection. Cystatin C, UGE, urine glucose:creatinine ratio 
(UGCR), N-terminal prohormone  of brain natriuretic peptid e (NT-proBNP) are other valid 
markers of renal function and volume status, and will be assessed at appropriate timepoints in this 
study. In addition, although clinical outcomes are not  expected to occur at a high enough rate to 
yield statistically significant information in this trial, outcomes such as death will be adjudicated by an independent adjudication committee. 
4.5 BENEFIT/RISK OF SOTAGLIFLOZIN 
Sotagliflozin is currently being investigated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with T2D. The development program will also provide efficacy and safety data for sotagliflozin in combination with other antidiabetic medications. Sotagliflozin has effects on SGLT2 and SGLT1. Based on the GI contribution of sotagliflozin in reducing the glucose through SGLT1 inhibition and the improvement of glycemia caused by the increase in half-life of insulin (as a result 
of the decreased renal function), efficacy is exp ected in advanced CKD patients. In addition the 
clinical outcomes will be evaluated in patients w ith high CV risk and in patients with renal 
impairment. Results to date from an earlier Phas e 1 study also suggest that patients with T2D and 
renal impairment stage 3A and 3B could benefit from dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibition with sotagliflozin as detailed in Section  4.3 without any safety concerns. The use of sotagliflozin in the 
treatment of T1D is also being studie d in a separate development program.

Improvements in HbA1c, FPG, and PPG were observed with sotagliflozin in multiple studies. As anticipated from the mechanism of action, treatment  with sotagliflozin resulted in increased UGE 
(from inhibition of SGLT2) as well as increased le vels of the intestinal peptides GLP-1 and PYY 
(from inhibition of SGLT1). In addition, the impr ovements in body weight and BP observed with 
sotagliflozin treatment have the potential to benefit patients with diabetes through their effects on common diabetic comorbidities. 
Phase 2 data indicated that sotagliflozin may reduce SBP by 10 to 15 mmHg in patients with SBP 
≥130 mmHg at Baseline, while having no significant effect in patients w ith SBP <130 mmHg, and 
did not induce hypotension in normotensive patients.  Since this could be of benefit to patients 
with T2D, this finding is being followed up as a secondary objective in this trial. 
SGLT2 inhibitors class have been associated with  small decreases of eGRF  and increased rate of 
genital infections, which are usually mild and well tolerated in clinical trials. Overall, sotagliflozin 
has been well-tolerated in all studies to date, with the majority of events assessed as mild to 
moderate, most of which resolved spontaneously. Serious AEs a nd discontinuations due to AEs 
have been limited and balanced between treatment and comparator groups.  
Events of special interest (EOSI) are evaluated based on either their potential link to the drug’s 
mechanism of action, events that occur in other SGLT-inhibitor drugs, or regulatory 
interest/guidance for diabetes products, but found not  to be in imbalance in clinical trials. In 
addition to the identified and potential risks (genital mycotic infections [male and female], metabolic acidosis, DKA, UTIs, volume depletion, severe hypoglycemia) for the sotagliflozin 
program, other EOSI have been defined. These EOSI are: MACEs and other cardiovascular 
events, venous thrombotic events (VTEs), drug-induced liver injuries (DILIs) / ALT increase 
>3 times ULN, diarrhea, pancreatitis, bone fractures, renal events, malignancies  of special interest 
(including but not limited to: breast, bladder, renal cell, Leydig cell, pancreatic, prostate and 
thyroid cancer), and AEs leading to amputation. 
However, reports of these events have been in frequent and have responded to standard treatment. 
The improvement in glycemic control, the reductions in weight and BP, and the tolerability and 
safety profile of sotagliflozi n to date demonstrate a favorab le benefit-risk assessment for 
sotagliflozin.

6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY 
This is a Phase 3, multicenter and multinationa l, 1:1:1 randomized, double-blind (single-blind 
Run-in Phase), placebo-controlled, parallel-group study that is antic ipated to enroll approximately 
276 patients. 
All patients will have a Screening Period comprise d of an up to 2-week Screening Phase and a 
2-week, single-blind placebo Run-in Phase pr ior to randomization. Following randomization, 
patients will have a 26-week, double-blind Treatment Period, 26- week, double-blind Extension 
Period, and a 4-week, post-t reatment Follow-up Visit. 
The study design is presented graphically in Section  1.1. 
6.1.1 Screening period 
6.1.1.1 Screening phase (Visit 1) 
The Screening phase will last up to 2 weeks. It must  be long enough to collect the data required to 
establish whether the patient satisfies the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Patients with T2D ( 14) who have inadequate glycemic cont rol (HbA1c 7% to 11%) and severe 
renal insufficiency (CKD4; defined by an eGFR) ( 15) are eligible for enrollment in this study. 
At the Screening Visit after signing of the informed consent form (ICF), eligibility criteria will be 
assessed and Screening assessments will be performed. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) not willing to use highly effective method(s) of birth control during the study treatment period and the follow-up period, or who are unwilling or  unable to be tested for pregnancy will be 
excluded from the study; guidance on highly-effec tive contraceptive methods and collection of 
pregnancy information is provided in Appendix A . If another contraceptive method is used (such 
as a barrier method), it should be used in combinat ion with one of the highly effective methods in 
Appendix A  (such as oral contraceptive). 
The Interactive Response Technology (IRT; eith er Interactive Voice Response System or 
Interactive Web Response System) will be contacted  at Visit 1 for notification of Screening and 
for patient number allocation. 
6.1.1.2 Run-in phase (Visit 2) 
The Run-in Phase will last 2 weeks. Patients will be treated in a single-blind manner with placebo (2 tablets) (identical to sotagliflozin 200 mg in appearance) administered once daily during the 
Run-in Period, starting from Visit 2.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 37 6.1.2 Double-blind Treatment Period (Day 1 to Week 26) 
Eligible patients will be randomized on Day 1 (V isit 3). In order to qualify for randomization, 
patients must also demonstrate compliance durin g the single-blind placebo Run-in Phase based 
upon tablet count ( ≥80%) and, as assessed, at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Randomization will be stratified by: 
• HbA1c at Screening (≤ 8.5% and >8.5%) 
• SBP at Screening (<130 mmHg, ≥130 mmHg). 
Following randomization, patients will be treated in a double-blind manner for 26 weeks. A total 
of 276 patients ≥18 years of age (or ≥ legal age of the majority, whichever is greater) are planned 
to be randomly assigned 1:1:1 to  the following treatment groups: 
• Placebo, given as 2 placebo tablets (identical to sotagliflozin 200 mg in appearance), once 
daily 
• Sotagliflozin 200 mg, given as 2 tablets: 1 so tagliflozin 200 mg tablet and 1 placebo tablet 
(identical to sotagliflozin 200 mg in appearance), once daily 
• Sotagliflozin 400 mg, given as 2 sotag liflozin 200 mg tablets, once daily. 
Fasting glucose (plasma or serum) and HbA1c results will be masked to study sites and patients 
after randomization until study end. To pr event partial unblinding, UGE and UGCR  will be 
masked to study sites and patients, and the central laboratory urine dipstick will not include the measurement of urine glucose.  
Quantitative urine glucose, albumin, calcium, and creatinine will be measured separately at 
selected on-site visits by the central laboratory. 
All visits will be on-site visits. If a patient discontinues treatme nt with investigational medicinal product (IMP) early during the 
Treatment Period, the patient will have a premature end of treatment (EOT) Visit and a Follow-up 
Visit, 4 weeks (± 5 days) after the last dose of IM P. In addition, every effort  will be made to have 
all patients return to the site at the time corres ponding to their scheduled visits, particularly the 
Weeks 26 and 52 Visits. 
If a patient does not agree to site visits, he/she will be contacted by telephone to inquire about 
their safety status, particularly at the time of the initially scheduled end of study. 
6.1.3 Double-blind Extension Period 
From Weeks 27 to 52, patients will be in a 26- week double-blind Extens ion Period. Patients will 
continue to receive the blinded medication (sot agliflozin 400 mg, 200 mg, or placebo) to which 
they were randomized on Day 1. Patients who received rescue medication during the initial 26-week Treatment Period will continue on the same rescue medication during the double-blind 
Extension Period (unless the Inve stigator considers a change necessary for safety reasons).

have a premature EOT Visit, and a Follow-up Visi t, 4 weeks after the last dose of IMP. In 
addition, every effort will be made  to have all patients return to the site at the time corresponding 
to their scheduled visits, particularly the Week 52 Visit. 
If a patient does not agree to site visits, he/she will be contacted by telephone to inquire about 
their safety status, particularly at the time of the initially scheduled end of study. 
6.1.4 Follow-up period 
Following the last dose of the IMP (either as  scheduled or prematurely), a post-treatment 
follow-up should be scheduled for all patients 28 days (4 weeks) ±5 days after permanent IMP 
discontinuation.  
6.2 DURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION 
6.2.1 Duration of study participation for each patient 
The total duration of the study for each patient will be up to 60 weeks and will include a 
Screening Phase of up to 2 weeks, a 2-week Run-in Phase, a 26-week double-blind Treatment 
Period, a 26-week double-blind Extension Pe riod, and a 4-week Follow-up Period after 
completion of study treatment. 
6.2.2 Determination of end of clinical trial (all patients) 
The end of the study is defined as being the “las t patient last visit” pl anned with the protocol, 
including the follow-up visit. 
The Sponsor can terminate the trial prematurel y based on the advice of the Independent data 
monitoring committee (DMC) or other unforeseen developments. 
6.3 STUDY COMMITTEES 
6.3.1 Steering committee 
The Steering Committee (SC) is composed of experts in diabetes and scientists with clinical and 
methodological expertise.  
This Committee, led by a Chair, is responsible for producing and conductin g a scientifically sound 
study and for ensuring accurate reporting of the st udy. In that capacity, the SC must address and 
resolve scientific issues encountered during the study. The members will remain blinded until 
completion of the study.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 39 Among its responsibilities, the SC will receive blinded study status reports from Sponsor, and will 
review the recommendations from the DMC th roughout the study. The SC members will 
participate in face-to-face meetings at regula r intervals throughout the study and in regularly 
scheduled teleconferences. 
Detailed activities and re sponsibilities of the SC are provide d in a separate SC Charter. 
6.3.2 Data monitoring committee 
A DMC with members who are independent from the Sponsor and the Investigators will meet on 
a regular basis and will be responsible for: 
• Review of accumulating clinical study safety data by treatment 
• Make a recommendation to the Sponsor rega rding the study following each meeting. 
To ensure safety, all randomized patients will be monitored weekly for their laboratories and 
safety for the first 4 weeks. When 10 patients in  each group are exposed for 4 weeks there will be 
a formal evaluation by DMC. 
Safety data to be reviewed will be unblinded and include even ts and outcomes described below 
for adjudication, as well as any additional safety da ta considered relevant. To maintain continuous 
blinding and study integrity, the analysis will be conducted by an inde pendent statistician and 
measures will be taken to ensure the validity of the data.  Details describing the DMC processes and procedures are outlined in a separate DMC Charter. 
6.3.3 Clinical endpoint committee(s) 
The Clinical Endpoint Committees (CECs) is/are comprised of experts in cardiology and 
nephrology (and other appropriate medical specia lties such as neurology and endocrinology as 
needed) who are independent of the Sponsor and the contract research organization (CRO). The 
CEC(s) will review and adjudicate all deaths, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), selected CV 
events (MI, stroke, unstable angina leading to  hospitalization, and heart failure leading to 
hospitalization), select ed renal events, bone fracture, and DKA. 
The details regarding the CEC processes and procedures will be outlined in the CEC Charter(s). 
6.3.4 Safety adjudication of events requiring ongoing monitoring 
Two independent committees will review safety events that require ongoing monitoring to ensure timing protocol amendments in case a safety signal is identified. These events are: 1) potential cases of DILI, and 2) cases of amputations. 
The two committees will review the cases in a treatment-blinded manner and will present their 
assessments to the DMC.

The dose maintenance will be handled according to the renal function assessed by the creatinine 
measurement throughout the study. If at any visit after randomization there is a rise in creatinine 
level (see details in Section  10.6.2), the Investigator should ensure  that no reasonable explanation 
exists for creatinine increase. Sites will be notified by central laboratory alert if a patient has a >50% increase from Baseline level or >50% above the mean of creatinine values from the last 2 visits, where Baseline level is defined as the mean of creatinine values obtained at Screening and Randomization. The IMP should be stopped for 2 weeks. If at creatinine recheck the patient

via IRT to 200 mg for patients randomized to  400 mg, maintained to 200 mg for patients 
randomized to 200 mg, and to placebo for those randomized to placebo). Since IMP received is blinded, patients must return to the site and IRT will be contacted  for this IMP re-initiation. Dose 
reduction can only be obtained at on-site visit by IRT. If the creatinine does not return to below 
the threshold, the IMP will be permanently discontinued but the patient will be asked to continue attending all study visits.

The thresholds values are defined as  follows, depending on study period: 
• From Baseline Visit (V3, Day 1) to Visit 8 (Week 8) (including value at Visit 8): FPG 
>270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) 
• From Visit 8 (Week 8) to Visit 9 (Week 12) (including value at Visit 9): FPG >240 mg/dL 
(13.3 mmol/L) 
• From Visit 9 (Week 12) up to the EOT Period Visit 13 (Week 52) (including value at Visit 13): FPG >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1c ≥ 8.5%  (the 8.5% criterion does not 
apply if the HbA1c decrease from Baseline was ≥1.0%). 
Routine fasting SMBG (SMBG will be presented as equivalent self-monitoring plasma glucose [SMPG]) and central lab alerts on FPG (and HbA1c at Week 12 and onwards) are set up to ensure that glycemic parame ters remain under predefined thresholds:  
• If one fasting SMBG value exceeds the spec ific glycemic limit on 1 day, the patient 
checks it again during the 2 following days. If all the values in 3 consecutive days exceed the specific limit, the patient shoul d contact the Investigator and a central laboratory 
FPG measurement (and HbA1c at Week 12 and onwards)  is performed as soon as 
possible, preferably within 7 da ys to confirm the hyperglycemia. 
• Upon receipt of a central laboratory rescue alert a central laboratory re-test must be 
completed and confirmed as exceeding the criterion  for rescue before rescue therapy is 
initiated. The re-test confirmati on should be performed as soon as possible, but within 
7 days of receipt by unscheduled visit. 
In the event that a confirmatory FPG and/or Hb A1c exceed the threshold, the Investigator should 
ensure that no reasonable explanation exists for in sufficient glucose control and in particular that: 
• The increased FPG has been tested at a fasting status (ie, no food intake for ≥8 hours) 
• Investigational product is given at the planned dose

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 47 • There is no intercurrent disease, which may jeopardize glycemic control (eg, infectious 
disease) 
• Compliance to treatment is appropriate 
• Compliance to diet and lif estyle is appropriate. 
If any of the above can reasonably explain the in sufficient glycemic control, the Investigator 
should consider not initiating re scue medication and should unde rtake appropriate action, ie: 
• Assess plasma glucose in fasting condition (ie, after at least 8 hours fast) 
• Initiate an evaluation and treatment of intercurrent disease (to be reported in 
AE/concomitant medication parts of the electronic case report form (e-CRF) and the medical record) 
• Stress on the absolute need to be compliant with treatment 
• Organize a specific interview with the patient and a Registered Dietician or other qualified nutrition professional and to reinforce on the ab solute need to be compliant to diet and 
lifestyle recommendations, a nd schedule an FPG/HbA1c assessment at the next visit. 
If none of the above mentioned reasons can be fo und, or if appropriate action fails to decrease 
FPG/HbA1c under the threshold values, re scue medication may be introduced ( 17). 
• Open label rescue medication(s)  to treat hyperglycemia must be in accordance with local 
standard of care and prescribing practice for patients with CKD and will be at the 
discretion of the investigator. Except for SGLT 2 inhibitors and medications with specific 
contraindications in renal impairment, an y approved medication(s) including oral 
antidiabetic drugs or insulin can be considered with appr opriate dose modification as 
indicated. 
• The patient continues the IMP (blinded) and stays in the study in order to collect efficacy and safety information. The planned visits and assessments should occur until the last 
scheduled visit 
• Rescue therapy is considered an NIMP. Resc ue therapy is to be reported in the e-CRF. 
This information should include specific drug  name, dose, route of administration, and 
frequency. 
If not covered by health insurance, the cost of the rescue therapy will be reimbursed by the Sponsor where permitted by local regulations. 
8.3 BLINDING PROCEDURES 
8.3.1 Methods of blinding 
To maintain blinding sotagliflozin and their matching placebo tablets (including packaging) will 
be blinded and indistinguishable.

EFC15166 - sotagliflozin Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 48 During the double-blind Treatment Period, each treatment package will be labeled with a number, 
which is generated by a computer  program from the Sanofi. Invest igators will not have access to 
the randomization (treatment) code ex cept under circumstances described in Section  8.3.2. 
The randomization and the treatment allocation will be performed centrally by an IRT. The study 
biostatistician provides th e randomization scheme to the IRT. Then, the IRT generates the patient 
randomization list from which it allocates treatment arms to the patients. 
Fasting glucose (plasma or serum) and HbA1c will  be masked to study sites and patients after 
randomization and until study end. To prevent pa rtial unblinding, UGE a nd UGCR results will be 
masked to study sites and patients. Additionally, urinalysis by dipstick will not include the 
measurement of urine glucose.  
Quantitative urine glucose, albumin, calcium, pho sphorus, magnesium, and creatinine will be 
measured separately at selected on-site visits by the central laboratory. The CEC members will perform adjudication in a blinded manner. 
8.3.1.1 First step data analysis 
The sponsor representatives that will be involved in  the first step analysis will not be involved in 
the conduct of the study from that point forward, and unblinded patient level results at the first 
step analysis will not be provided to the study sites. 
8.3.2 Randomization code breaking during the study 
In case of an AE, the randomization code should only be broken in circumstances when 
knowledge of the IMP is require d for treating the patient.  
Code breaking can be performed at any time by using the proper module of the IRT and/or by 
calling any other phone number provided by the S ponsor for that purpose. Code breaking can be 
performed by a local study Investigator, sponsor phy sician or healthcare professional with direct 
responsibility for patient care. If the blind is broken, the Investigator should document the date, 
time of day, and reason for code breaking. The identity of the unblinded personnel, how the code 
was broken, and the treatment kit number should also be recorded. The Sponsor should also be 
informed. If the code is broken by the Inves tigator (or other medical doctor in emergency 
situation); the patient must be withdrawn from IMP administration.  
Randomization code breaking will also be performed during the analysis of the Pharmacokinetic 
plasma concentration samples. Only the Project manager and lead scientist at the Bioanalytical 
laboratory will have access to the randomization code to allow for th e sorting of the sotagliflozin 
plasma samples. The Bioanalytical lab and responsible personnel will follow the standard procedures to ensure the protection of the b lind within the Sponsor’s  clinical team. The 
randomization code or the individual analytical results will not be disclosed to any clinical team 
personnel prior to th e database lock.

8.6 STORAGE CONDITIONS AND SHELF LIFE 
Investigators or other authorized persons (eg, phar macists) are responsible for storing the IMP in a 
secure and safe place in accordance with local regulations, labeling specif ications, policies, and 
procedures.  
Control of IMP storage conditions, especially cont rol of temperature and instructions for handling 
the Sanofi compound should be managed according to the rules provided by the Sponsor. The expiry date and storage conditions are wr itten on the IMP labels. So tagliflozin should be 
stored between +15ºC an d +30ºC (59ºF and 86ºF). 
8.7 RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Investigator, the hospital pharmacist, or othe r personnel allowed to store and dispense the 
IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP us ed in the clinical trial is securely maintained 
as specified by the Sponsor or Delegate a nd in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements. All IMP will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator’s prescription and it is the 
Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that an a ccurate record of IMP issued and returned is 
maintained. 
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or us e of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labeling,  expiration date, etc) should be promptly notified to the 
Sponsor or Delegate. Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure. 
A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by the 
Sponsor. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request made by the Sponsor in order to reca ll the IMP and eliminate potential hazards. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply IMP to a third party (except for direct-to-patient shipment, for which a courier co mpany has been approved by the Sponsor), allow 
the IMP to be used other than as directed by this  clinical trial protocol, or dispose of IMP in any 
other manner. 
8.7.1 Treatment accountability and compliance 
Accounting and compliance for IMPs will be performed at Visit 3 and all subsequent on-treatment 
on-site visits. 
The Investigator will check the compliance to the study treatments based on the patient diary and 
will then complete the appropriate site treatment and patient treatment log forms. Returned IMP

appropriate pages of the e-CRF. 
Rescue therapy (see Section  8.2.1) is to be reported in the e-CRF. This information should include 
specific drug name, dose, route of administration, and frequency. 
If compliance is inadequate as determined by the Principal Investigator (PI), patients will be 
trained again and mentored. If suboptimal compliance continues af ter training and mentoring, 
patients may be discontinued at th e discretion of the PI after disc ussion with the Sponsor’s/CRO’s 
medical monitor. 
8.7.2 Return and/or destruction of treatments 
Patients are to return all IMP (unused, in-use or used treatment k its) at each on-site visit or at 
on-site visits after permanent premature treatment discontinuati on as described in Section  1.2). 
At Visit 4 (Week 1), Visit 5 (Week 2), and Visit 6 (Week 3), because no IMP re-supply is planned during these visits, patients will be sent home after these visits with the in-use treatment kit dispensed at randomization. 
Patients are to return all the used, in-use and unused IMP at Visit 13 (or final assessment 
on-treatment visit in case of pe rmanent premature discontinuation). 
All used, partially-used or unused IMPs will be retrieved by the Sponsor or Dele gate. A detailed 
site and patient treatment log of the returned IMP will be established with the Investigator (or the 
pharmacist) and countersigned by the I nvestigator and the monitoring team. 
For NIMP not provided by the Sponsor (ie, rescue  therapy), tracking and reconciliation is to be 
undertaken by the Investigator (o r pharmacist if appropriate) acco rding to the system proposed by 
the CRO. 
8.8 CONCOMITANT MEDICATION 
A concomitant medication is any tr eatment received by the patient concomitantly to any IMP. The 
IMP includes placebo and sotagliflozin 400 mg and 200 mg. 
Background antidiabetic medication:  Except for SGLT2 inhibitor (eg, canagliflozin, 
dapagliflozin, or empagliflozin), at the study entr y patients can be treated with any injectable or 
oral antidiabetic medication(s) in accordance with the local medical care guidance. The type or 
dose of medication(s) should remain unchanged during the study course. The dose modification or 
discontinuation of an existing antidiabetic medica tion is allowed for safety concerns at the 
Investigator’s medical judgment. 
All concomitant medications shoul d be documented on the Medicati ons pages of the e-CRF. This 
includes all NIMP treatments that are taken by the patients at any time during the clinical study, 
beginning at Visit 1.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 52 Additionally, all medications take n in the 3 months prior to Visit 1 and any prior use of SGLT2 
inhibitor should be reported. 
8.8.1 Prohibited prior and concomitant medications 
During the study treatment period, the following medications are prohibited: 
• Initiation of any antidiabetic agents, including oral or injectable antihyperglycemic agents 
other than the IMP and NIMP is not allowed before the rescue therapy. The existing background medication (NIMP) should not be modified before the rescue. 
Note
: short term use (<10 consecutive days) of  the prohibited medica tion eg, short-acting 
insulin for treatment of acute illness or surgery is allowed. 
• SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, canagliflozin, dapaglif lozin, or empagliflozin) are not allowed for 
rescue.  
• Systemic use of glucocorticoids for more than 10 consecutive days (topical, intra-articular, ophthalmic, nasal spray or inhale d applications are allowed). 
• Investigational medici nal products in any other clinical study. 
• Modification of antihypertensive medication before Week 12 is not allowed unless for safety reasons. 
• Initiation of any weight loss drugs (eg, phentermine, orlistat). 
• Reduction of digoxin dose should be considered because sotagliflozin acts as a weak P-gp 
inhibitor and increases systemic exposure to digoxin.  
Patients taking sotagliflozin w ith concomitant digoxin should have digoxin concentrations 
monitored and doses reduced as needed. In add ition, other P-gp substrates may be affected 
and the labels of P-gp substrate drugs should be consulted with regards to monitoring and 
dose adjustments. 
Other medications which are unlikely to interfer e with the PK or PD of the IMP or confound 
interpretation of the study endpoints are allowe d as needed following discussion between the 
Investigator and the Sponsor/CRO. However, doses  of chronically administered medicines should 
be kept fixed during the trial if at all possible. 
The dose of all antihypertensive agents should be  kept constant during the 12 weeks following 
randomization and no antihypertensive agents s hould be added or withdrawn for the 12 weeks 
following randomization unless it is consid ered necessary for safety reasons. 
8.8.2 Concomitant diabetes therapy 
Any background antidiabetic therapy (oral or inj ected including insulin) is permitted with the 
exception of other sodium-glucose cotr ansporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors 
The rescue medication(s) that will be used to treat hyperglycemia (see Section  8.2.1) when a 
patient’s hyperglycemia reaches the rescue threshold is also defined as NIMPs. Except for SGLT2

medication(s) including or al/subcutaneous antidiabetic  drugs or insulin can be prescribed to treat 
the hyperglycemia as long as it is used within labeling guidelines for renal impairment. In 
addition, for patients already prescribed insulin the dose may be increase d. If a patient requires 
glycemic rescue the IMP received during th e randomized, double-bli nd Treatment Period and 
Extension Period should continue and must remain blinded until th e end of the study. Background 
medication may need to be adjusted if hypoglycemia occurs. 
8.9 POSTSTUDY TREATMENT 
Because sotagliflozin may reduce BP, adjustment of antihypertensive medication may be needed 
during the study in patients with hypertension. Co nversely, monitoring for an increase in BP 
should be performed after withdrawal of study medi cation. If the BP is elevated after withdrawal 
of study treatment, the Investigator should cons ider adding or adjusting antihypertensive 
medication. Sotagliflozin will not be  provided after EOT. Patient’s further treatment, for diabetes 
and other pathologies will be at  the Investigator’s discretion ba sed on his/her clinical judgment.

9.1.4 Assessment methods of efficacy endpoints 
9.1.4.1 Hemoglobin A1c 
Hemoglobin A1c will be assessed at Screening (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 3), and all on-site visits 
during the double-blind Treatment Period with the exception of Week 1 (Visit 4), Week 2 (Visit 5), Week 3 (Visit 6), and Week 4 (Visit 7). HbA1c is measured by a certified Level I 
“National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program” central laboratory at time points described in the flow chart ( Section  1.2). 
9.1.4.2 Fasting plasma glucose measurement 
Plasma glucose is measured in the fasting state at Screening (Visit 1) and all on-site visits during the treatment period (with the exception of Visits 4, 5, and 6). For the eligibility and efficacy assessments of the study, FPG is measured at a central laboratory to allow estimation of change 
from Baseline to Weeks 26 and 52 in FPG.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 56 9.1.4.3 Body weight measurement 
Body weight is measured at all on-site visits. Body weight should be obtained with the patient 
wearing undergarments or very light clothing and no shoes, and with an empty bladder. The same 
scale should be used throughout the study, and calibrated on a regular basis as recommended by 
the manufacturer. Calibration s hould be documented in source documents.  The use of balance 
scales is recommended; if digital scales are used, testing with standard we ights is of particular 
importance. The floor surface on which the scale re sts must be hard and sh ould not be carpeted or 
covered with other soft material. The scale should be balanced with both weights at zero and the 
balance bar aligned. The patient should stand in the center of the platform as standing off-center 
may affect measurement. The weights are moved un til the beam balances (the arrows are aligned). 
The weight is read and recorded in the e-CRF  and Source Data. Self-r eported weights are not 
acceptable; patients must not read the scales themselves. 
9.1.4.4 Blood pressure measurements 
Systolic BP and DBP will be asse ssed at all on-site visits. Blood pr essure measurements must be 
taken as described in Section  9.2.1.5 with details provided in Appendix C . 
9.1.4.5 Kidney function parameter assessments 
Serum creatinine and urine albumin, protein, cal cium, creatinine, phosphorus, magnesium, and 
glucose will be assessed at Baseline (Visit 3) and at selected on-site visits (see Section  1.2). A 
central laboratory will analyze samples and estimate change from Baseline in UACR, UGE, 
UGCR, serum creatinine, and eGFR. To prevent partial unblinding, UGE and UGCR results will 
be masked to study sites.  
9.1.4.6 Fructosamine, cystatin C, and NT-proBNP measurements 
Fructosamine is measured in the fasting state at Baseline (Visit 3) and all on-site visits during the treatment period with the exception of Week 1 (V isit 4), Week 2 (Visit 5), and Week 3 (Visit 6). 
Cystatin C and NT-proBNP are measured in the fasting state at Baseline (Visit 3) and all on-site 
visits during the treatment period with the ex ception of Weeks 8 and 18 (Visits 8 and 10). In 
addition, cystatin C is also to be measured at Week 56 (Visit 14). 
For the eligibility and efficacy assessments of the study, fructosamine, cystatin C, and 
NT-proBNP are measured at a central laboratory to allow estimation of change from Baseline to Week 26. 
9.1.4.7 Use of rescue medication for hyperglycemia 
The use of rescue medications for hyperglycemia  will be assessed and re ported throughout the 
treatment period. Routine alerts on FPG will be sent to the Investigat or from the central laboratory 
to ensure that glycemic parameter results remain within predefined thresholds. For details and further actions should FPG values fall above thresholds, refer to Section  8.2.1.

Patients will be monitore d throughout the Treatment Periods for progression of renal disease 
(>50% decline in eGFR, progression from norma l to microalbuminuria, and progression from 
microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria). 
Patients will be monitored at Week 4, and throughout the remainder of the study for progression 
to ESRD (progression to dialysis either hemodial ysis or peritoneal dialysis or transplant).  
9.2 SAFETY ENDPOINTS 
Assessments for safety include AEs, SMBG, clinical laboratory assessments, physical 
examination, ECG, weight, and vital signs. An independent DMC will meet on a regular basis to 
review accumulating clinical trial safety data. 
Adjudication of all deaths, MACE/other selected CV events, selected renal events, bone fracture, 
and DKA will be performed in a blinded manner by a CEC(s) comprised of experts. Details will 
be provided in the charter of the CEC( s). Further details are available in Section  6.3.3. 
Two expert committees will review all potential cases of DILIs and cases of amputation in a 
treatment-blinded manner to evaluate causality. 
The following safety endpoints will be assessed: 
• Incidence of TEAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation from the IMP, AESIs, EOSIs, SAEs 
and deaths 
• Hypoglycemia (all, severe and/or documented symptomatic hypoglycemia) 
• Acute renal failure (see Appendix D ) 
• Clinical laboratory results (including fasting lipids; see Section  9.2.1.3, vital signs, and 
ECG results 
• Markers of bone and calcium metabolism 
• Markers of intestinal transit and absorption 
Observation period of safety endpoints  
The observation period of safety data will be divided into 3 segments: 
• The pre-treatment period is defined as the time between the date of the informed consent 
and the first dose of double-blind IMP 
(electronic

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 58 • The on-treatment period (TEAE period) is defined as the time from the first dose of 
double-blind IMP up to 15 days (1 day for hypoglycemia) after the last dose of 
double-blind IMP, regardless of the introduction of  rescue therapy. The 15-day interval is 
chosen based on the half-life of the IMP (approximately 5 times the half-life of sotagliflozin) in patients with severe renal dysfunction 
• The post-treatment period is defined as the time starting 16 days after the last dose of 
double-blind IMP (after the on-treatment period). 
The baseline value for safety endpoints in the safe ty population is the last available value (or the 
average of all values for creatinine or eGFR) pr ior to the first administration of the double-blind 
IMP. 
9.2.1 Assessment methods of safety endpoints 
9.2.1.1 Adverse events 
Adverse events including SAE, AESI, and EOSI will be assessed. Refer to Section  10.4 to 
Section  10.7 for details. 
9.2.1.1.1 Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse events of special interest are listed in Section  10.4.1.3; reporting requirements for AESI 
are presented in Section  10.4.4. 
9.2.1.1.2 Events of special interest 
Events of special interest are separate from AESIs.  For a list of events defined as EOSIs and their 
reporting requirements see Section  10.4.1.4 and Section  10.4.5, respectively. 
9.2.1.2 Hypoglycemia 
Hypoglycemia (all, severe and/or documented symptomatic hypoglycemia) will be assessed from 
the signing of the ICF until 4 weeks after the last dose of IMP. Patients will also complete the patient diary, which will be regularly reviewed by Investigators. See Section  10.6.1 for further 
details. 
9.2.1.3 Laboratory safety variables 
The clinical laboratory data consist of blood anal ysis (including hematolo gy clinical chemistry 
amylase, lipase, and lipid profile) and urinalysis, according to the schedule presented in  Section  1.2. Clinical laboratory values will be analyzed after conversion into standard 
international units. International units will be used in all listings and tables. Table 2  lists the 
hematology, clinical chemistry, and other blood sa fety parameters to be assessed by the central 
laboratory.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 61 9.2.1.4 Urinalysis 
Urinalysis (urine dipstick with microscopy) by central laboratory will be performed at Run-in 
(Visit 2), Baseline (Visit 3), at all on-site visits during the doubl e-blind Treatment Period, and at 
Week 52. To prevent partial unblinding, the central  laboratory urine dipstick will not include the 
measurement of urine glucose. Central urinalysis includes: 
• Urine dipstick includes: specific gravit y, pH, protein, blood, ketones, bilirubin, 
urobilinogen, nitrite, a nd leukocyte esterase 
• Urine microscopy includes, but is not limited to: detection of formed cellular elements, casts, bacteria, yeast, parasites, and cr ystals in centrifuged urine sediment. 
In the event of abnormal urinalysis findings suspic ious of UTI, urine culture should be performed. 
Positive urine culture determina tion will be based upon the criteri a of the reporting laboratory. 
Additionally, urine culture should be performed if at any point th e Principal Investigator suspects 
the presence of a UTI. 
In addition, urine albumin, calcium, phosphorus, gl ucose, magnesium, and creatinine will be 
assessed at Baseline (Visit 3) and selected on-site visits during treatment periods.  
If the urine dipstick is positive for blood, the centr al laboratory will perform reflexive testing to 
include microscopy. Additional testing will be performed according to the judgment of the 
Investigator. Referral to urology/urologic ev aluation is recommended for new or unexplained 
cases of confirmed hematuria (urology/urologic evaluation is not required where hematuria is 
considered to be related to diabetic nephropathy). 
9.2.1.5 Vital signs and physical exam 
A complete physical exam (including sitting BP and heart rate [HR], temperature, and respiratory rate) will be performed at Visit 1 (Screening), Visit 11 (Week 26), and Visit 13 (Week 52). Abbreviated physical exams (including sitting BP and HR) will be performed at all other on-site 
visits, with the exception of Visits 4, 5, 11, and 13 (Weeks 1, 2, 26, and 52, respectively). The 
abbreviated physical exam should focus on cardiac and respiratory systems, as well as any areas 
important for assessment of AEs if necessary. 
Vital signs, including: sitting BP and HR will be assessed at Screening and Run-in (Visits 1 and 
2), and all on-site visits. Three se parate seated BPs and HR measur ements should be taken with at 
least 1 minute between measurements following a 5-minute rest period and prior to phlebotomy. 
Full details and directions for the measurement of BP are presented in Appendix C . 
9.2.1.6 Electrocardiogram variables 
The ECG assessment of “normal” or “abnormal” will be analyzed. 
A 12-lead ECG record is performed locally at Run-in (Visit 2), Week 26 (Visit 11), and Week 52 
(Visit 13).

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 62 The 12-lead ECG should be performed  after at least 10 minutes in supine position and prior to the 
morning IMP administration. The Investigator  should review the ECG and document the 
interpretation, sign and date it on the ECG print out and report it in the e-CRF. Each ECG trace is 
analyzed in comparison with the screening recorded  trace. All original traces are kept as source 
data. 
Note: Any new ECG abnormality should be re checked for confirmation and reported as 
appropriate for that finding. 
9.2.1.7 Self-monitoring of blood glucose 
A meter for self-assessment of blood glucose will be dispensed at the Run-in visit (Visit 2). 
Self-monitoring blood glucose will be presente d as equivalent SMPG. In addition to home 
measurements of SMBG, SMBG will be performed at Run-in (Visit 2), Baseline (Visit 3) and all 
subsequent on-site visits with the exception of  Weeks 1 and 2 (Visits 4 and 5, respectively).  
Patients will also receive a patient diary at all on-site Visits with the exception of Visits 4, 5, and 14. The diary will be reviewed at all on-site vi sits from Visit 2 to Visit 14. Self-assessed blood 
glucose levels will be entered in the patient diary. 
Patients will be asked to self-assess blood glucose levels at least 3 times a week from the Run-in 
Visit (Visit 2) to the e nd of treatment, Visit 11. 
Patients will be re quested to self-assess blood gl ucose levels in the fasted state and whenever they 
experience any illnesses (eg, cold, flu), or symptoms of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. 
Symptoms of hypoglycemia may include shakiness,  dizziness, sweating, hunger, headache, pale 
skin color, sudden moodiness or be havior changes (such as crying for no apparent reason), clumsy 
or jerky movements, seizure, difficulty paying attention or confusion, or tingling sensations 
around the mouth. Patients will be instructed to reco rd the presence or absence of hypoglycemic 
episodes or hypoglycemic symptoms in the patient diary provided. 
Patients will also be instructed to record SMBG values that are ≤70 mg/dL ( ≤3.9 mmol/L) in the 
patient diary. Patients should be instructed to contact the site if fasting SMBG values over 
3 consecutive days are:  
• From Baseline Visit (Visit 3, Day 1) to Visit 8 (Week 8) (including value at Visit 8): FPG >270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) 
• From Visit 8 (Week 8) to Visit 9 (Week 12) (including value at Visit 9): FPG >240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) 
• From Visit 9 (Week 12) up to Visit 13 (Week 52): FPG/fasting SMBG >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1c ≥8.5% (the 8.5% criterion does not apply if the HbA1c decrease 
from Baseline was ≥ 1.0%).

9.3.1 Pharmacokinetics of sotagliflozin 
The PK endpoints for sotagliflozin are: 
• Plasma concentrations of sotagliflozin and its metabolite sotagliflozin-3-O-glucuronide in 
the sotagliflozin treatment arms  at Weeks 4, 18, 26, 39, and 52.  
Pharmacokinetic sotagliflozin da ta may be subjected to a population PK analysis, which will be 
reported separately to the c linical study report (CSR).  
9.3.1.1 Sampling time 
At Weeks 4, 18, 26, 39, and 52 (Visits 7, 10, 11, 12, and 13, respectively) blood samples for PK assessment are to be drawn with the other laborat ory assessments prior to IMP administration. An 
additional blood sample w ill be drawn at Weeks 26 and 52 Vis its 3 hours after administering the 
dose of IMP. The time of the last intake of study drug prior to visits were PK samples are taken 
should be recorded by the patient in the patient di ary. Patients should be reminded of this at visits 
preceding PK time points to ensure these details are captured. In the case of premature IMP discontinuation, PK samples should not be drawn at the Premature EOT visit; or at subsequent 
visits (see Table 3 for the identification of samples).

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 66 The other efficacy and safety assessments in  this study are standard, well-established 
measurements for a Phase 3 study evaluating the treatment of T2D in adult participants.  
The length of the study is cons idered appropriate for detection of the primary endpoint given the 
power estimates (see Section  11). 
Phase 2 data indicated that sotagliflozin may reduce SBP by 10 to 15 mmHg in patients with SBP 
≥130 mmHg at Baseline, while having no significant effect in patients w ith SBP <130 mmHg, and 
did not induce hypotension in normotensive patients.  Since this could be of benefit to patients 
with T2D, this finding is being followed up as a secondary objective in this trial, as well as the 
potential in patients with DBP >80 mmHg. Although  effects on BP in Phase 2 data were observed 
with the 400 mg dose at 12 weeks, the effects will be examined at Weeks 12, 26, and 52. Because of potential effects on bone and calcium metabolism, specific biomarkers for bone and 
calcium metabolism will be assessed at regular timepoints. In view of the SGLT1 inhibitory 
effects in the GI tract, specific markers of intestinal transit and absorption will also be measured. Because of rat toxicology studies of questionable clinical significance showing tubule dilation in 
the kidney, high bone density in the sternum, and hyperplasia of stomach glandular cells, the biomarkers for urine, bone, and GI tract will also be measured at early timepoints of 2 and 
4 weeks.

10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE 
The visit schedule and procedures/assessments  are listed in the Study Flow Chart ( Section  1.2). 
The aim of this section is to provide details on how so me of the procedures/assessments should be 
performed. 
This is an out-patient study and consists of 14 on-site visits, although optional on-site and/or 
telephone visits can be scheduled at any time  for any reason during the study whenever 
considered necessary by the Investigator. The patients need to be fasting for on-site visits Visit 1 through Visit 13 (Week -4 through 
Week 52), unless instructed otherwise by the I nvestigator. Throughout the study, “fasting” is 
defined as 8 hours without food. Note : If the patient is not fasting at the visits specified above, the 
blood sample will not be collected  and a new appointment should be  given to the patient for the 
following day if possible, with instruction to be  fasted (other procedures can be performed as 
scheduled). All laboratory assessments will occur prior to IMP administration on the day of the visit. 
The Run-in visit (Visit 2) can be performed as soon as the results of all screening tests are 
available and the patient is confirmed to be eligible for participation in the study. The visit window for on-treatment Visit 4 through Visit 12 is  ±5 days. Visits 13 (EOT) should occur at the 
scheduled timepoint ±5 days. For the Follow-up (V isit 14), the visit window should occur within 
±5 days, 4 weeks after last dose of IMP.  
If one visit date is changed, the next visit s hould occur according to the original schedule, ie, 
calculated from the date of Baseline visit (Visit 3, Week 0). 
For a complete list of procedures scheduled for each study visit please refer to the Study 
Flowchart ( Section  1.2), which details the procedures to be performed.  
All data obtained during the trial visits are revi ewed by the Investigator and Sub-Investigators 
who are qualified in tr eatment of T2D and are trained on the study. 
10.1.1 Screening period 
The Screening period is up to 4 weeks and includes the Screening Phase and the Run-in Phase. 
10.1.1.1 Screening phase 
The duration of the Screening Phase is up to 2 weeks and includes only the Screening Visit 1 
(Week -4). The period must be long enough to co llect the data to establish whether the patient 
satisfies the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

For screen failure patients, the following source data must be verified: patient’s identification 
details, the informed consent signed by the patient, the study identification (name), dates of study visits, and the main reasons for screen failure. 
10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possibl e. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made tempor arily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the e-CRF. In any case, the 
patient should remain in the stud y and followed for the remainder of the study to collect vital 
safety status and endpoint data. 
10.3.1 Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product 
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be consider ed by the Investigator because of suspected 
AEs. 
Lower extremity complications (such as skin ulcers, infection, osteomyelitis, and gangrene) 
requiring treatment should lead to temporary discontinuation of IMP. If at any visit after randomization up to Week 8 there is a rise in creatinine level (ie, >50% 
increase from baseline level, where baseline level is defined as the mean of creatinine values obtained at Screening and Randomizati on) or if at any visit after Week 8 there is a rise of >50% 
above the mean of creatinine values from last 2 visits, the Investigator should ensure that no 
reasonable explanation exists for creatinine increase.  
The IMP should be stopped for 2 weeks.  Re-initiation of treatment  with the IMP will be done under cl ose and appropriate clinical/and or 
laboratory monitoring once the Investigator has considered according to his/her best medical 
judgment that the responsibility of the IMP in the occurrence of the concerned event was unlikely 
to be related to the IMP and that the selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to 
Section  7.1 and Section  7.2). 
If at creatinine recheck the patient has returned to the below threshold then IMP will be restarted at a reduced dose (ie, dose reduced via IRT to 200 mg for those randomized to 400 mg; maintained at 200 mg for those randomized to 200 mg). Since the IMP received is blinded, patients must return to the site and IRT will be contacted for IMP re-initiation.   
It is in the interest of the patient to mon itor blood glucose during the temporary discontinuation 
period, therefore regular determin ation of SMBG is to be performed and documented (see  
Section  9.2.1.7).

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 81 For all temporary treatment discontinuations, duration should be reco rded by the Investigator in 
the appropriate pages of the e-CRF  when considered as confirmed. 
Temporary treatment discontinuation decided by th e Investigator corresponds to more than 1 dose 
not administered to the patient. 
Use of any other anti-hyperglycemic medication during the time of temporary treatment 
discontinuation (ie, insulin during a hospitalization) is recorded as concomitant medication with the name and doses recorded in the e-CRF.  
10.3.2 Permanent treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product 
Permanent treatment discontinuati on defined as any treatment disc ontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator or the patient not to re-expose the patient to the IMP at any time. 
10.3.3 List of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason, or this may be th e Investigator’s decision. Patients should discuss 
stopping study medication with the site before doing  so in order that quest ions can be addressed, 
glycemic therapy adjusted, and a follow-up assess ment arranged. All effo rts should be made to 
document the reasons for treatment discontinuati on and this should be documented in the e-CRF. 
The following reasons can lead to permanent discontinuation: 
• At the patient’s own request (ie, w ithdrawal of consent for treatment) 
• If, in the Investigator’s opinion, continua tion with the administration of the study 
treatment would be detrimental to the patient's well-being 
• Inter-current condition that requires permanen t discontinuation of th e study treatment as 
long as the abnormality persists and if the ca sual relationship of the concerned event and 
the IMP is possible (according to the In vestigator’s best medical judgment) 
• Deterioration of renal function (defined as increase in serum creatinine >50% from baseline) that is not recovered after a temporary IMP discontinuation for 2 weeks 
• Patient requires renal replacement therapy (transplant or dialysis) 
• Pregnancy (in female patients) 
• Specific request of the Sponsor. 
Any abnormal laboratory value will be rechecke d immediately to confirm the result before a 
decision is made to permanently disc ontinue IMP for the concerned patient. 
For patients who prematurely discontinue the IM P, the assessments planned at EOT visit  
(Section  10.1.3.2) will be performed at the premature EOT Visit scheduled preferably prior to 
treatment discontinuation or as soon as possible after the time of discontinua tion (at the latest at 
the next scheduled on-site visit). In the case of premature IMP disc ontinuation, PK samples

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 82 should not be drawn at the premature EOT visit, neither at all subsequent visits. The reason for 
IMP discontinuation will be clearly specified. This Premature EOT assessment may occur at a regularly scheduled visit or at an unscheduled visit. 
10.3.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation 
Every effort should be made to maintain patients in the study. Patients should be followed up according to the study procedures as specified in this protocol up to the scheduled date of study completion, or up to recovery or stabilization of any AE to be followed up as specified in this 
protocol, whichever comes later. 
If a patient prematurely discontinues st udy treatment, a premature EOT visit  
(see Section  10.1.3.2) should be scheduled prio r to treatment discontinua tion, if possible. If not 
possible, the Premature EOT should be sche duled as soon as possible after treatment 
discontinuation. In the case of early disc ontinuation, no sample for measuring plasma 
concentration should be taken at the premature EOT visit, or at any subsequent visit. For patients 
who discontinue treatment but remain in the study, the remaining study visits should occur as 
scheduled where possible. The IRT should be notified of EOT. 
All cases of permanent treatment discontinuation s hould be recorded by the Investigator in the 
appropriate pages of the e-CRF. 
10.3.5  Procedure and consequence for patient withdrawal from study 
Patients may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at any time 
and irrespective of the reason. Withdrawal of c onsent for treatment should be distinguished from 
withdrawal of consent for follow-up visits. Patients will be told that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time without any adverse effect on their care. However, if they no longer wish to take the IMP, they will be encouraged to remain in the study and attend the remaining study visits. The value of all their study data co llected during their contin ued involvement will be 
emphasized as important to the pub lic health value of the study. 
If possible, the patients are assessed using the procedure normally planned for the end of study 
visit. 
Patients who withdraw should be explicitly asked about the contribution of possible AEs to their 
decision to withdraw consent, and any AE inform ation elicited should be documented. Preferably 
the patient should withdraw consent in writing and, if the patient or the patient’s representative 
refuses or is physically unavailable, the site should document and sign the reason for the patient’s 
failure to withdraw consent in writing.  
All confirmed study withdr awals should be recorded by the Inve stigator in the appropriate screens 
of the e-CRF and in the patient’s medical records. In the medical record, at least the date of the 
withdrawal and the reason should be documented. 
For patients who fail to return to the site, unle ss the patient withdraws consent for follow-up, the 
Investigator should make the best effort to re-c ontact the patient (eg, c ontact patient’s family or

health status, including at least his/her vital status. Attempts (3 phone call attempts followed by a 
certified letter) to contact such patients must be documented in the patient’s records (eg, times and dates of attempted te lephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter). 
Patients who have withdraw n from the study cannot be re-randomized (treated) in the study. Their 
inclusion and treatment numb ers must not be reused.  
10.4 OBLIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFETY REPORTING 
10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events 10.4.1.1 Adverse event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with the IMP. 
10.4.1.2 Serious adverse event 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, or 
• Is life-threatening, or 
Note : The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe 
• Requires inpatient hos pitalization or prolongation of  existing hospitalization, or 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or 
• Is a medically important event 
Medical and scientific judgme nt should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in othe r situations, such as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical or surgical in tervention (ie, specific measures or corrective 
treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Note : The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline for 
determining which conditi on has to be considered a medically  important event. The list is not 
intended to be exhaustive:

sampling) 
• Bullous cutaneous eruptions 
• Cancers diagnosed during the study or aggravated during the study  
• Chronic neurodegenerative diseases (newly diagnosed) or aggravated during the study. 
10.4.1.3 Adverse event of special interest 
An AESI is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor is required. Such even ts may require further investigation in order to 
characterize and understand them. Adverse events of  special interest may be added, modified or 
removed during a study by protocol amendment. 
• Pregnancy of a female patient entered in a study as well as pregnancy occurring in a female partner of a male patient entered in a study with IMP/NIMP:  
- Pregnancy occurring in a female patient included in the clinical trial or in a female 
partner of a male patient entered in the clinical trial. It will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills one of the seriousness criteria (see Section  10.4.1.2) 
- In the event of pregnancy in a fema le patient, IMP shoul d be discontinued 
- Follow-up of the pregnancy in a female patient or in a female partner of a male patient 
is mandatory until the outcome has been determined (see Appendix A ) 
• Symptomatic overdose (serious or nonserious) with IMP/NIMP 
- A symptomatic overdose (accidental or intentional) with the IMP/NIMP is an event 
suspected by the Investigator or spontaneous ly notified by the patient and resulting in 
clinical symptoms and/or signs accompanied by administration of more than twice the intended daily dose within a 24-hour period. It  will be recorded in the e-CRF as an 
AESI with immediate notification “Symptomatic OVERDOSE (accidental or intentional)” in all cases and will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills the SAE

assessment. It will be recorded as an AE “Asymptomatic OVERDOSE, accidental or intentional”). 
• ALT increase >3 times ULN  
10.4.1.4 Events of special Interest 
An EOSI is a serious or nonserious AE of scien tific and medical concern specific to the Sponsor’s 
product or program, for which ongoing monitoring may be appropriate. Such events may require further investigation in order to characterize  and understand them. These events should be 
reported on the specific e-CRF page (where applicable) and will only qualify for expedited reporting when serious (fulfilling SAE criteria). 
The EOSIs for this study are: 
• MACE (CV death, MI, or stroke)and other specific  CV events (eg, heart failure leading to 
hospitalization) 
• Severe hypoglycemia (see Section  10.6.1) 
• Genital mycotic infections (to include vulvova ginal candidiasis in females and candidal

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 86 10.4.2 General guidelines for reporting adverse events 
• All AEs, regardless of seriousness or rela tionship to IMP/NIMP, spanning from the 
signature of the ICF until the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that patient, 
are to be recorded on the corresponding page(s) or screen(s) of the e-CRF. 
• Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. The Investigator should specify the date of ons et, intensity, action taken with respect to 
IMP, corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome, and his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the IMP or by the study procedure(s).  
• In this study, the use of concomitant medi cations including antidiabetic medications may 
make it difficult to assess the causal relati onship, particularly for hypoglycemia. Global 
Safety Officer with input from other appropr iate study team memb ers will determine the 
causal relationship when it is not clearly provided by the Investigator. 
• The Investigator should take appropriate measur es to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that observations will continue beyond the last plan ned visit per protocol , and that additional 
investigations may be requested by the monito ring team up to as noticed by the Sponsor.  
• When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until 
the end of the study as defined by  the protocol for that patient. 
• Laboratory, vital signs or ECG abnormalities ar e to be recorded as AEs if they are 
medically relevant based on the inve stigator’s medical judgment, eg:  
- Symptomatic and/or 
- Requiring either corrective trea tment or consu ltation and/or 
- Leading to IMP discontinuation or  modification of dosing and/or 
- Fulfilling a seriousness criterion and/or 
- Defined as an AESI or EOSI. 
10.4.3 Instructions for reporting serious adverse events 
In the case of occurrence of an SAE, the Investigator or any designees must immediately: 
• ENTER (within 24 hours) the information related to the SAE in the appropriate screens of 
the e-CRF; the system will automatically send the notification to the Monitoring team and 
Pharmacovigilance after approval of the Investigator within the e-CRF. 
• SEND (preferably by fax or e-mail) a photocop y of all examinations carried out and the 
dates on which these examinations were perform ed, to the representative of the monitoring 
team whose name, fax number, and e-mail addr ess appear on the clin ical trial protocol. 
Care should be taken to ensure  that the patient’s identity is protected and the patient’s

further document any SAE that is fatal or life-threatening within a week (7 days) of the initial notification. 
• A back-up plan (using a paper case report form  [CRF] process) is available and should be 
used when the e-CRF system does not work. 
Any SAE brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after the end of the study for the patient and considered by him/her  to be caused by the IMP with a reasonable possibility, should 
be reported to the monitoring team. 
10.4.4 Guidelines for reporting adverse events of special interest 
For AESIs, the Sponsor must be informed immediately (ie, within 24 hours), as per SAE 
notification guidelines described in Section  10.4.3, even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, 
using the corresponding pages of the CRF (t o be sent) or screens in the e-CRF. 
10.4.5 Guidelines for reporting events of special interest 
If an EOSI fulfills the criteria of an SAE,  reporting should be performed according to the 
instructions for reporting of SAEs (see Section  10.4.3). Otherwise, reporting should follow the 
instructions for an AE (see Section  10.4.2).  
10.4.6 Guidelines for management of specific laboratory abnormalities 
Decision trees for the management of certain laboratory abnormalities by Sanofi are provided in Appendix D .  
The following laboratory abnormalities should be monitored, docum ented, and managed 
according to the related flow chart in protocol appendices:  
• Neutropenia 
• Thrombocytopenia 
• Increase in ALT 
• Acute renal insufficiency 
• Suspicion of rhabdomyolysis

During the course of the study, the Sponsor will report in an expedited manner: 
• All SAEs that are both unexpected and at least reasonably related to the IMP (SUSAR) to 
the regulatory authorities, independent ethics committee (IECs)/institutional review boards (IRBs) as appropriate and to the Investigators;  
• All SAEs that are expected and at least reasonably related to the IMPs to the regulatory authorities, according to local regulations; 
• The following AESIs to those regulatory authorities who require such reporting: 
- Pregnancy 
- Symptomatic overdose 
- ALT increase >3 times ULN 
Adverse events that are considered expected will be specified by the reference safety information 
provided in the current IB. 
If required, unblinding of SUSARs will be the responsibility of the Sponsor. 
The Sponsor will report all safety observations made during the condu ct of the trial in the CSR. 
10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 
10.6.1 Hypoglycemia 
During the study, patients are instructed to do cument any hypoglycemic episodes in their study 
diary. The hypoglycemia will be reported in the specific e-CRF page with onset date and time, 
symptoms and/or signs, the SMBG value if available, and the treatment. If the event fulfills SAE 
criteria, hypoglycemia will also be reported as an SAE.  
Hypoglycemia is categorized according to th e American Diabetes Association workgroup on 
hypoglycemia classification ( 20, 21) and summarized in Figure 1 . 
In addition to the threshold of less than or  equal to 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), hypoglycemia 
episodes with a plasma glucose of <54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) will be analyzed separately.

PG = plasma gluc ose; SAE = serious adverse event 
Severe hypoglycemia 
Severe hypoglycemia is an event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer 
carbohydrate, glucagon, intravenous glucose or ot her resuscitative actions. These episodes may be 
associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure, unconsciousness or coma. Self-monitored plasma glucose values may not be available, but neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of plasma gluc ose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was 
induced by a low plasma glucose concentration. 
Note
: “Requiring assistance of another person” means that the patie nt could not help himself or 
herself to treat the hypoglycemia. Assisting a patient out of kindness, when assistance is not 
required, should not be considered a “requires assistance” incident. 
Any hypoglycemic event which leads to uncons ciousness, coma, or seizure should also be 
reported as an SAE. 
Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia 
Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia is an event during which typical symptoms of 
hypoglycemia accompanied by a measured plasma glucose concentration of ≤3.9 mmol/L 
(≤70 mg/dL).

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 90 Clinical symptoms that are considered to result from a hypoglycemic episode include, increased 
sweating, nervousness, asthenia/weakness, tremor , dizziness, increased appetite, palpitations, 
headache, sleep disorder, confusion, seizures, unconsciousness, or coma. 
Asymptomatic hypoglycemia 
Asymptomatic hypoglycemia is an event not acco mpanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycemia 
but with a measured plasma glucose concentration ≤3.9 mmol/L ( ≤70 mg/dL).  
Note : low plasma glucose values without symptoms  or signs should not be reported more than 
once within 30 minutes. Repeated low glucose valu es within a short period could be due to 
malfunction of the device, error testing or following up a low glucose reading. The Investigator 
should try not to document false low SMBG va lues or redundant low glucose values as 
asymptomatic hypoglycemic events. Further clarification with the patients is needed. 
Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia 
Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia is an event during which symptoms of hypoglycemia are not 
accompanied by a plasma glucose determination, ( but that was presumably caused by a plasma 
glucose concentration ≤3.9 mmol/L [ ≤70 mg/dL]), ie, symptoms treated with oral carbohydrate 
without  a test of plasma glucose.  
Relative hypoglycemia 
Relative hypoglycemia, recently termed “pseudo-hypoglycemia” ( 22), is an event during which 
the patient reports typical symptoms of hypoglycemia, and interprets the symptoms as indicative 
of hypoglycemia, but with a measured plasma  glucose concentration >3.9 mmol/L (>70 mg/dL). 
10.6.2 Deterioration of renal function 
Patients will be monitore d throughout the double-blind Treatment Period for signs of deterioration 
in renal function (eg, decrease in eGFR or increase  in creatinine as defined below) as well as other 
routine clinical and laboratory findings (see Study Flowchart, Section  1.2). If at any visit after 
randomization up to Week 8 there is a rise in creatinine level (ie, >50% increase from baseline 
level, where baseline level is defined as the mean  of creatinine values obtained at Screening and 
Randomization) or if at any visit after Week 8 there is a rise of >50% above the mean of 
creatinine values from last 2 visits, the Investig ator should ensure that no reasonable explanation 
exists for creatinine increase and in particular the following causes: 
• Medications that increase creatinine 
• Decrease in cardiac output 
• Obstructive uropathy 
• Urinary tract infection 
• Volume depletion

the IMP will be stopped for 2 weeks. The dose will be handling according to the renal function 
assessed by the creatinine measurement throughout the study and as detailed in Section  10.3.1. 
If the creatinine dose not return to below the threshold, then the IMP will be permanently 
discontinued but the patient will be asked to continue attending all study visits.

11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
The sample size/power calculations were performed based on the primary endpoint. Assuming a 
common standard deviation of 1.2% and using a 2-sided test at a 0.05 α-level, 92 patients in each 
group will provide at least 80% power to detect a treatment difference of 0.5% in mean HbA1c 
change from Baseline to Week 26 between sotagliflozin 400 mg and placebo. 
11.2 DISPOSITION OF PATIENTS 
The total number of patients for each of the following categories will be presented in the CSR: 
• Screened patients: patients who have signed the ICF 
• Run-in patients 
• Randomized patients: patients with a treatment  kit number allocated and recorded in IRT 
database, regardless of whether th e treatment kit was used or not 
• The safety population (ie, rando mized and treated patients) 
• The intent-to-treat (ITT) population (as defined in Section  11.3.1.1 and analyzed as 
randomized) 
• The randomization strata (HbA1c at Screening [ ≤8.5%, >8.5%] and SBP at Screening 
[<130 mmHg, ≥130 mmHg]). The discrepancy between the strata assigned by IRT and the 
information reported on e-CRF will be listed for all randomized patients 
• Patients who have completed the 26-week double-blind Treatment Period 
• Patients who discontinued th e IMP during the 26-week double-blind Treatment Period, 
and the reasons for treatment discontinuation 
• Patients who have completed the 52-week entire treatment period 
• Patients who discontinued the IMP during the 52-week entire treatment period, and the 
reasons for treatment discontinuation 
• Patients who have completed the study 
• Patients who discontinued the study, and the reasons for study discontinuation 
For all categories of patients except screened, percentages will be calculated using the number of 
randomized patients as denominator for each treatment group. 
A list of patients prematurely discontinued from the treatment, along with reasons for 
discontinuation, will be pr ovided. Similarly, a list of patients prematurely discontinued from the 
study, along with reasons for discontinuation, w ill be provided.

but not treated as randomized will be identified and described in separa te listings. The safety 
experience of patients treated and not randomized will be reported separately, and these patients 
will not be in the safety population. 
For any patient randomized more than once, only th e data associated with the first randomization 
will be used in any analysis population. The sa fety experience associated with any later 
randomization will be assessed separately. 
11.3 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 
11.3.1 Efficacy population 
Efficacy analyses will be based on the treatment group allocated by the IRT according to the 
randomization schedule at randomiz ation visit (as randomized), irrespective of the treatment 
actually received. 
11.3.1.1 Intent-to-treat population 
Efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT population, defined as all randomized patients, 
irrespective of compliance with the study protocol and procedures. Patients will be analyzed for efficacy analyses according to the treatment group to which they are randomized. 
11.3.2 Safety population  
Safety analyses will be based on the safety population, defined as all randomized patients who 
receive at least 1 dose of double-blind IMP (regardless of the amount of treatment administered). 
Patients will be analyzed for safety analyses  according to the treatment actually received. 
In addition: 
• Non-randomized but treated patie nts will not be part of the safety population, but their 
safety data will be presented separately 
• Randomized patients for whom it is unclear whether they took the study medication will 
be included in the safety population as randomized 
• When a patient is exposed to both sotagliflozi n and placebo, the patient will be analyzed in 
the sotagliflozin group according to the treatment kit taken (400 mg or 200 mg, 
respectively) 
• When a patient is exposed to both sotag liflozin 400 mg (treatment kit) and 200 mg 
(treatment kit), the patient will be anal yzed in the sotagliflozin 200 mg group 
• Randomized patients will be excluded from the safety population only if there is 
documented evidence (ie, all study dates reco rded as no medication taken) that patients 
have not taken the study medication

Continuous data will be summa rized by treatment group using the number of observations 
available (N), mean, standard deviati on (SD), minimum, median, and maximum. 
Categorical data will be summarized by tr eatment group using count and percentage. 
In general, descriptive statistics of quantitative efficacy and safety parameters (result and change 
from Baseline) by scheduled visits will be provided on observed cases (OC), ie, inclusion of only patients having non-missing asse ssments at a specific visit. 
The baseline value is defined generally as the last available value before the first dose of double-blind IMP or the last available value prior to randomization for patients who were 
randomized but never exposed to IMP.  
For serum creatinine and eGFR, the Baseline value is  defined as the average of all values before 
the first dose of double-blind IMP for those rando mized and exposed or before randomization for 
those who were randomized but never exposed to IMP. Analysis of demographics and baseline characteristics, prior and concomitant medications will be 
provided in detail in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
11.4.1 Extent of study treatment exposure and compliance 
The extent of study treatment exposure and compliance will be assessed and summarized by actual treatment received in the safety population. 
11.4.1.1 Extent of investigational medicinal product exposure 
The extent of study treatment exposure will be assessed by the duration of treatment exposure during the study.  
The duration of treatment exposure will be the total number of days of administration of the 
double-blind IMP, regardless of unplanned interm ittent discontinuations . The duration of IMP 
exposure will be calculated as: 
 (Date of the last double-blind IMP taken – Date of the first double-blind IMP taken) + 1 The number (%) of patients randomized and exposed to double-blind IMP will be presented by 
specific time periods for each treatment group. The time  periods of interest will be defined in the 
SAP. 
Descriptive statistics of duration of treatment  exposure (number, mean, SD, minimum, median, 
and maximum) and cumulative expos ure in patient year will also be presented by treatment group 
in the safety population.

A given administration will be c onsidered noncompliant if the pa tient did not take the planned 
dose of treatment as required by the protocol. No imputation will be made for patients with 
missing or incomplete data.  
Treatment compliance, above-p lanned and under-planned dosing pe rcentages will be summarized 
descriptively (N, mean, SD, medi an, minimum, and maximum). The percentage of patients with 
compliance <80% will be summarized. In addition, th e number and percentage of patients with at 
least 1 above-planned dosing administration will be given, as well as the number and percentage 
of patients with 0, (0, 20 %], and >20% under-planne d dosing administrations. 
11.4.2  Analyses of efficacy endpoints 
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population. Statistical testing will be performed for primary endpoint and secondary endpoints at  Week 26 (or Week 12 for SBP). All efficacy 
endpoints after Week 26 will only be summarized by descriptive statistics without formal 
statistical testing. 
11.4.2.1 Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint 
The statistical test will be two-sided tests at a nominal 5% significance level. 
Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (change from Baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c; see 
Section  9.1.1) will be performed on the ITT populati on, using HbA1c measurements obtained 
from visits during the study, including those obtai ned after IMP discontinuation or introduction of 
rescue therapy. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of change in HbA1c from Baseline to Week 26 will be analyzed 
with missing values imputed by control-base d multiple imputation method under the missing not 
at random framework: 
• For placebo patients, missing data will be imputed based on the placebo group data. 
• For patients in the sotagliflozin groups, missing  data will be imputed as if the patients 
were on placebo group throughout the study, wh ere all patients’ measurements including 
the on-treatment measurements will be considered as if the measurements were from the placebo group in the imputation model. 
Each of the complete datasets will be analyzed by an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment groups (sotagliflozin 400 mg, sotagliflozin 200 mg, placebo), randomization 
stratum of Screening HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%), randomization st ratum of screening SBP (<130 
mmHg, ≥ 130 mmHg), and country as fixed effects, a nd baseline HbA1c value as a covariate. 
Results from each complete datase t will be combined to provide the adjusted mean change in 
HbA1c from Baseline to Week 26 for each treatment group, as well as the between group difference (comparing sotagliflozin 400 mg vers us placebo) and its associated 95% confidence 
interval (CI) using contrast statements.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 96 Summary statistics (for screening value, baselin e value, observed values, and observed changes 
from Baseline) at scheduled visits will be provided for each treatment group. The summary will 
include the number of observations, mean, SD , standard error (SE), minimum, median, and 
maximum. Graphical presentations will also be used to examine trends over time using mean 
values (± SE) and mean changes from Baseline (± SE) at each of the scheduled visits (using OC). 
Assessment of treatment effect by subgroup 
Descriptive analyses will be performed on the primary endpoint to summarize the treatment 
effects across subgroups defined by the fo llowing Baseline or Screening factors: 
• Race 
• Ethnicity (Hispanic, Not Hispanic) 
• Age group (<50 years, ≥50 to <65 years, ≥65 years) 
• Gender 
• Baseline BMI level (<30, ≥30 kg/m2) 
• Baseline HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%) 
• Baseline SBP (<130 mmHg, ≥ 130 mmHg) 
• Country. 
The treatment effects across the subgroups defined for each of these factors will be estimated for 
the change from baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c in the ITT population, and using a similar 
approach to the analysis for the primary effica cy endpoint. The adjusted estimates of treatment 
mean differences (comparing sotagliflozin 400 mg versus placebo) with SE and 95% CIs will be 
provided as appropriate across the su bgroups using contrast statements. 
In the event that the subgroup factor is identical  or similar to a randomization strata factor (eg, 
baseline HbA1c category); only the subgroup factor (a s a single factor and/or  an interaction term) 
will be included in the model in order to avoid the issue of collinearity in the analysis. The 
corresponding strata factor will not be included in the model. 
11.4.2.2 Analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints 
The secondary endpoints (see Section  9.1.2) will be analyzed using a similar approach to the 
primary efficacy endpoint with missing values  imputed by control-based multiple imputation 
method under the missing not at random framework.  
• For placebo patients, missing data will be imputed based on the placebo group data. 
• For patients in the sotagliflozin groups, missing  data will be imputed as if the patients 
were on placebo group throughout the study, wh ere all patients’ measurements including 
the on-study measurements will be considered as if the measurements were from the 
placebo group in the imputation model.

randomization stratum of screening HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%), randomization stratum of screening 
SBP (<130 mmHg, ≥130 mmHg), and country as fixed eff ects, and baseline secondary endpoint 
value as a covariate. Results from each complete da taset will be combined to provide the adjusted 
mean change from baseline to Week 26 (or Week 12 for SBP) for each treatment group, as well as 
the between group difference (comparing each sotagliflozin group versus placebo) and its 
associated 95% CI using contrast statements. 
The categorical secondary endpoint  such as HbA1c responders (<6.5% or <7%) at Week 26 will 
be analyzed using a Cochran-Ma ntel-Haenszel method stratified by randomization stratum of 
Screening HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%) and randomization stra tum of screening SBP (<130 mmHg, 
≥130 mmHg). The proportion in each treatment group will be provided, as well as the difference 
of proportions between each sotagliflozin group and placebo with associated 2-sided 95% CI. 
For HbA1c responders at Week 26, all values at Week 26 will be used to determine whether a 
patient is a responder or not, even if they ar e measured after IMP di scontinuation or rescue 
medication use. Patients who have no HbA1c measurement at Week 26 will be treated as non-responders. 
The urinary albumin/creatinine ratio will be log- transformed before the analysis. Change from 
baseline to Week 26 of urinary albumin/creatinine ratio in log scale will be analyzed. Results in 
the log scale will be back-transformed to provide the ratio and then the percent change of urinary albumin/creatinine ratio at Week 26 versus Baseli ne based on the geometric means as well as the 
corresponding 95% CIs. 
For all secondary endpoints, summa ry statistics at scheduled vi sits will be provided for each 
treatment group. The summary will include the nu mber of observations, mean, SD, SE, minimum, 
median, and maximum. Graphical presentations will also be used to examine trends over time 
using mean values (± SE) and mean changes from Ba seline (± SE) at each of the scheduled visits

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 99 The following definitions will be applied to laboratory parameters and vital signs: 
• The potentially clinically significant abnorma lity (PCSA) values for clinical laboratory 
tests and vital signs are define d as abnormal values considered  medically important by the 
Sponsor’s Global Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology department and in effect at the 
time of the final SAP approval. The PCSA criteria for parameters not cited in the protocol 
as safety parameters will not be analyzed 
• The PCSA criteria will determine which patients had at least 1 PCSA during the on-treatment period, taking into account all evaluations perform ed during the on-treatment 
period, including unscheduled or repeated ev aluations. The number of all such patients 
will be the numerator for the on-treatment PCSA percentage

vital sign and ECG parameters. 
11.4.3.1 Analysis of adverse events 
Pre-treatment AEs  are AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the 
pre-treatment period. 
Treatment-emergent AEs  are AEs that developed or worsened  (according to the Investigator’s 
opinion) or became serious during the on-treatment period. Post-treatment AEs  are AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the 
post-treatment period. The primary focus of AE reporting in the CSR will be on TEAEs. Pre- and post-treatment AEs 
will be described separately. 
All adverse events 
Adverse event incidence tables will present by system organ class (SOC) (sorted by 
internationally agreed order), high level group term (HLGT), high level term (HLT) and preferred 
term (PT) sorted in alphabeti cal order for each treatment group, the number (N) and percentage 
(%) of patients experiencing an AE. Multiple occurre nces of the same event in the same patient 
will be counted only once in the tables w ithin a treatment phase. The denominator for 
computation of percentages is the safe ty population within each treatment group.  
Summaries of all TEAEs in each  treatment group will include:

11.5 INTERIM ANALYSIS 
No formal interim analysis for efficacy is plan ned since analysis of primary and key secondary 
efficacy endpoints will be considered final at the t ime of first step analyses described below. The 
study analyses will be conducted in 2 steps. 
• First step: Efficacy analyses up to Week 26 and interim safety analyses 
The first step analyses will be conducted when  all patients have been  randomized and have 
their data at the minimum up to Week 26 collected and validated. The first step analyses will 
include: 
- Efficacy analyses up to Week 26, which ar e considered as the final analyses for 
primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints.  
- Interim safety analyses which will be performed on all safety data collected and 
validated at the time of the first step analyses. 
The first step analyses will not be used to change the conduct of the ongoing study in any 
aspect. Since the primary and key secondary efficacy analyses would have been concluded at the time of the first step analyses, the signif icance level for the study remains at 0.05 (see 
Section  11.4.2.4). The first step analyses will be included in the submission dossier to health 
authorities. 
• Second step: Final analyses 
The second step analyses will be conducted at th e end of the study. The second step analyses 
will include the final analyses of efficacy e ndpoints at Week 52 and safety endpoints, which 
will be descriptive only. 
Individuals who are involved in the unblinding of th e first step analysis will not be involved in the 
conduct of the study afterwards. 
An independent DMC will monito r and assess the safety of patients from this trial through 
periodic review of the accumulated safety data  provided by an independent statistical group. 
Related details are provided in separate documents (DMC  charter and DMC SAP).

1. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: 
- Documented hysterectomy 
- Documented bilateral salpingectomy 
- Documented bilateral oophorectomy 
2. Postmenopausal - A postmenopausal state is defined as no mens es for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle-stimulating hor mone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal 
range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormone replacement ther apy (HRT). However, in the absence of 
12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
- Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT ) and whose menopausal status is in 
doubt will be required to use 1 of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to 
allow confirmation of po stmenopausal status before study enrollment. 
Reproductive potential  (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered of reproductive potential (WOCBP), ie, fertile, following menarche and 
until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently  sterile. Permanent sterilization methods 
include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. 
CONTRACEPTIVE GUIDANCE 
Women of reproductive potential (WOCBP) must us e a highly effective method of contraception 
during the treatment period and the post-treatment follow up peri od (28 ±3 days). If another 
contraceptive method is used (such as a barrier method), it should be used in combination with 
one of the highly effective methods (such as an oral contraceptive).

Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent 
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctlya 
• Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing ) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation 
- oral 
- intravaginal 
- transdermal 
• Progestogen-only hormone contraception a ssociated with inhibition of ovulation 
- oral 
- injectable 
Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent 
• Implantable progestogen-only hormone cont raception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation 
• Intrauterine device (IUD) 
• Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS) 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion 
• Vasectomized partner 
(Vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole 
sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If 
not, an additional highly effective method(s) of contraception should be used. Spermatogenesis cycle is 
approximately 90 days.)  
• Sexual abstinence 
(Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The reliability 
of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the patient.)  
NOTE: 
a Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent with local regul ations 
regarding the use of contraceptive methods for patients participating in clinical studies. 
 
COLLECTION OF PREGNANCY INFORMATION  
Male patients with partners of reproductive potential who become pregnant  
• The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partner of a 
male study patient who becomes pregnant while participating in this study. This applies only to patients who receive study treatment.

directly, the Investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and 
submit it to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy.  
• Partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on 
the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor.  
• Generally, follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery 
date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence 
or absence of anomalies) or  indication for procedure.  
Female patients who become pregnant  
• The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female patient, who becomes pregnant while participating in this study.  
• Information will be recorded on the appropriat e form and submitted to the Sponsor within 
24 hours of learning of a participant's pregnancy.  
• Participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator 
will collect follow-up information on participant and neonate, which will be forwarded to 
the Sponsor. Generally, follow-up will not be re quired for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond 
the estimated delivery date.  
• Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure.  
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be  an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication 
or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE.  
• A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. 
• Any SAE occurring as a result of a post-stud y pregnancy which is considered reasonably 
related to the study treatment by the Inves tigator, will be reported to the Sponsor as 
described in Section  10.4.3. While the Investigator is not obligated to actively seek this 
information in former study patients, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous 
reporting.

hydration and recognizing diabetic ketoacidosis 
Patients with T2D are at risk for developing genito-urinary (GU) infections. The following 
guidelines should be communicated to females an d uncircumcised males regarding GU infections. 
Patient communication cards will be printed with the following: 
For females: 
“The following advice may be useful in helpin g you to keep your bladder and urethra free from 
infection: 
• Go to the toilet as soon as you feel the need to urinate, rather than holding it in.  
• Wipe from front to back after going to the toilet.  
• Practice good hygiene by washing your genita ls every day, and before having sex.  
• Empty your bladder after having sex.”  
For uncircumcised males: 
“The following advice may be useful in helpin g you to keep the foreskin free from infection: 
• Wash the end of your penis and foreskin with soap and water (do not let soap get in the 
opening).  
• After your shower or bath, dry the end of your penis and foreskin properly and replace the foreskin.  
• Also, when you urinate, slide the foreskin back enough so that urine does not get on the foreskin-this helps to keep it clean.” 
Maintaining Hydration: 
Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors are associated with osmotic diuresis and volume 
depletion, which may lead to dizz iness or hypotension, especially in the elderly. Before initiating 
study drug (at Screening, Run-in and Randomization)  and during all on-site study visits thereafter, 
assess volume status in patients with  renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low SBP, or if 
receiving diuretics, angiotensin- converting-enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers. 
All patients will be advised to maintain proper fluid intake and to consider increasing it if they sense greater thirst, more urine producti on, or if they feel dizzy or faint. 
Patient communication cards will be printed with the following for patients with T2D: 
“The following advice may be useful in helpin g you to maintain prope r hydration and prevent 
dehydration: 
• Dehydration is when your body loses too much fluid, frequently due to diarrhea or 
increased urination

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 120 • Consider increasing the amount of fluids you drink if: 
- You sense greater thirst than usual 
- You have a dry mouth or cracked lips 
- You have a fever 
- You have diarrhea or vomiting  
- You urinate more frequently or in larger amounts than usual 
- You get up in the middle of the night to urinate (more than usual) 
- You feel dizzy or light-headed 
- You exercise, or when it is hot outside  
Recognizing Diabetic Ketoacidosis 
Potential GI adverse events occurring with so tagliflozin may mask presenting symptoms of 
diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Patient communication cards will be printed with the following: 
If you have any of these symptoms on the list, then contact your study site immediately for 
assistance with managing your diabetes: 
• Inability to maintain oral intake 
• Generalized weakness 
• Abdominal (belly) pain 
• Increased weight loss 
• Fever 
• Frequent urination, including at night 
• Fruity-scented breath 
• Confusion 
• Acute illness 
• Consistently elevated blood glucose 
• Feeling very thirsty or drinking a lot 
• Nausea or vomiting 
• Having trouble thinking clearly or feeling tired 
It is possible to have DKA even if your blood glucose is not elevated. Regardless of your blood 
glucose level, if you have any of these sympto ms on the list, then contact your study site 
regarding the need to be evaluated for possible DKA, which will include specific blood testing. If 
your study site is closed and your study doctor is  not available, go to the nearest emergency room 
for evaluation.

please contact your study doctor fo r instructions on continuing study drug. In such cases your 
study doctor may advise you NOT to take your st udy drug from the day prior to the procedure or 
surgery until after the procedure or surgery is co mplete, and you are taking food and liquids as 
you normally do.” 
Whenever AE data is collected or the patient  reports DKA or intercurrent illness (including 
infections), generalized weakness, increased weight loss, GI symptoms including nausea, 
vomiting, or abdominal pain or other symptoms or signs that the Investigator believes may be 
consistent with DKA, then the site will determine if an assessment for DKA is appropriate. If 
laboratory testing confirms pres ence of metabolic acidosis, then the “Possible DKA” e-CRF will 
be completed.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 122 Appendix C Measurement of blood pressure and pulse rate  
Equipment 
1. Blood pressure measurements will be taken by an automated BP monitor or a manual 
sphygmomanometer 
2. Bladder Length – Should nearly or completely encircle the patient’s arm. For many adults, 
the standard “adult” size bladder is not l ong enough and the “large” size bladder is 
recommended 
3. Bladder Width – Should be at least 40% of the bladder length 
Patient Factors 
Extraneous variables associated  with the measurement of BP should be minimized. These include: 
1. Food intake, caffeine-containing beverages, cigarette smoking, or strenuous exercise 
within 2 hours prior to measuremen 
2. Full urinary bladder 
3. The patient should not be allowed to talk while BP is being measured 
4. The patient should be placed in the examination room and the cuff should be placed on the 
patient’s nondominant arm. The proper sized cuff should fit snugly with the lower edge 
2 to 3 cm above the antecubital fossa. 
5. The patient should be allowed to sit quietly in a comfortably warm place (temperature 
around 25°C or 77°F) for 5 minutes with the arm supported at heart level, preferably with 
the cuff in place and with no restrictive cl othing on the arm. The patient should be 
encouraged not to tense his or her muscles. 
Determination of the arm with  the highest blood pressure 
At Visit 1 (Week -4), seated BP should be measured in both arms after 5-minute rest period, and then again after 1 minute in both arms in seated position. The arm with the highest SBP will be determined at this visit, and BP should be  measured in this arm throughout the study.  
Measurement Technique (24) 
At visit 1, immediately following arm selection, with the patient in the same position, an additional seated BP should be measured in th e selected arm (at least 1 minute after last 
measurement). 
At all other on-site visits, following the 5-minut e rest period, 3 separate seated BPs should be 
measured in the arm selected at Visit 1, with at least 1 minute between BP measurements and with 
the cuff fully deflated between measurements.

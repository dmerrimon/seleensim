2.0  BACKGROUND: 
 
2.1 Antiangiogenic activity in colorectal cancer 
An
tiangiogenic therapy has been a mainstay in colon cancer since the approval of 
bevacizumab over a decade ago.1  Angiogenesis is thought of as a hallmark of cancer, 
and microvascular density and other markers of increased angiogenesis have been shown 
to predict worse outcomes in colorectal canc er.2,3  The use of bevacizumab, the 
prototypic antiangiogenic agent, has been shown to decrease tumor perfusion, 
microvascular density, and interstitial fluid pressure in rectal tumors,4 treatment of 
patients with advanced disease is associated with improved survival, both in initial 
therapy, and in second-line, in combination with different chemotherapy.1,5 
 
The role of VEGF pathway inhibition through antibodies and antibody fragments 
continues to expand.  Bevacizumab has now demonstrated benefit in both the first- and 
se
cond-line setting in combination with chemotherapy in colorectal cancer.5,6 Aflibercept, 
a
 recombinant protein that combines VEGF1R and VEGF2R segments with the Fc 
portion of human IgG, shows survival benefit in the second-line setting.7  Antibody 
targeting of VEGFR2 through ramucirumab, a fully human IgG1 antibody specific to 
VEGFR2, also improves survival in the second-line setting.8 
 
More elusive in colorectal cancer has been the development of oral small molecule 
inhibitors of angiogenesis.  Numerous tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been or are 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 5 currently being developed to target angiogenesis through the VEGF pathway.  Various 
combinations using these drugs have ultimately failed during clinical trials in colorectal 
cancer.9-13  Some considerations to be borne in mind for these drugs include multiple off-
tar
get effects, limited pharmacodynamic grounding, frequent combination with 
chemotherapy, which may not be the optimal setting, and questions about optimal 
scheduling for drugs with short half-lives.   We recently published a randomized phase II 
tr
ial showing lack of effect of the addition of sorafenib to chemotherapy.  Nonetheless, as 
will be described in detail below, regorafenib was FDA-approved for use in colorectal 
cancer, on the basis of a single-agent trial.  It has demonstrated a modest survival benefit 
in the third-line setting as a single agent with very few objective responses, suggesting a 
cytostatic effect14.  Since regorafenib and sorafenib are almost identical in their 
preclinical and clinical characteristics, we expect the combinations proposed here to be 
safe, and any improvement in activity to be readily evident. 
 
2.2 Resistance to Antiangiogenic therapy 
The mechanisms through which angiogenesis inhibitors result in greater tumor cell kill 
have been studied extensively but remain incompletely understood.  The prevailing 
hypothesis is that antiangiogenic therapy works to “normalize” the disrupted vasculature 
of tumors, resulting in increased drug delivery.15,16  In this scenario, the disordered 
a
ngiogenesis that characterizes colon cancers is normalized through inhibition of 
endothelial proliferation, to normalize interstitial pressure and improve chemotherapy 
delivery.  We have proposed an alternative hypothesis, that antiangiogenic therapy 
chokes off the vascular supply of nutrients and oxygen and, by inducing hypoxia, adds to 
the cellular stress of cytotoxic chemotherapy.17,18  Preclinical models respond to 
bevacizumab in vivo proportionally to their susceptibility to hypoxic cell death.17,19 
Additional mechanistic insights have been provided by the work of Kerbel and colleagues 
who have elucidated the contribution of circulating marrow-derived stem cells, which 
may have a profound effect on the tumor microenvironment.20,21  As yet, these proposed 
m
echanisms have not yielded useful markers to define the population of patients that may 
benefit from antiangiogenic therapy. 
 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 6 2.3  Autophagy as a mechanism of anti-angiogenic therapy resistance 
Hypoxia and low vascularity environments are frequent obstacles to proliferation 
encountered by tumor cells, and they have developed pathways of resistance.  One such 
pathway is autophagy, in which tumor cells autodigest organelles and cytoplasm to 
generate energy in low nutrient and/or oxygen-poor environments.22,23  Autophagy is a 
m
ulti-step process that involves the vesicular sequestration of cytoplasmic proteins and 
damaged organelles into a structure called the autophagic vesicle (AV). AVs fuse with 
lysosomes and AV contents are degraded by acid-dependent enzymes. This process is 
activated by numerous cell stresses including growth factor or nutrient limitation, 
hypoxia, chemotherapy, and radiation.24  The anti-malarial drugs CQ and HCQ induce 
the death of cells that rely on autophagy for survival by impairing lysosomal function, 
b
locking the last step of autophagy.  This strategy has demonstrated early promise in 
m
ultiple tumor types, especially in combination with antiangiogenic therapy.25 
 
We have performed multiple Phase I trials that all show combinations of cytotoxic drugs 
with therapeutic doses of HCQ to be tolerable.  We performed a Phase I/II trial of the 
combination of HCQ and FOLFOX/bevacizumab in patients with metastatic colorectal 
cancer.  Eligible patients had Stage IV colorectal cancer, with no prior therapy for 
metastatic disease, good PS (0,1), and adequate hematologic and biochemical indices.  
We entered 16 patients in the Phase I portion, 6M/10F, median age 57.5, and PS 0 (9) or 
1 (7).  One patient had received prior adjuvant treatment 6 months or more prior to being 
enrolled.  Three patients were treated with 300 mg BID PO continuously in the first 
c
ohort, 8 patients were treated with 400 mg PO BID, and 5 patients were treated with 
600
mg PO BID. No dose-limiting toxicities were seen. The most common adverse events 
were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, and neuropathy. In the first cohort, one patient had MRSA 
port infection and one patient had a pulmonary embolism, two patients had grade 3 
neutropenia and one had grade 3 fatigue in the second cohort, and in the third cohort 
there was one cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolism and four patients with grade 3 
neutropenia. The adverse events were not thought to be related to the addition of 
hydrochloroquine to FOLFOX and bevacizumab. In all cohorts, 44% of patients had 
partial response, 37% had stable disease, and 19% had progressive disease.  We 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 7 concluded that full doses of FOLFOX/bevacizumab are well-tolerated in combination 
with HCQ 600mg PO BID continuously. 
 
We continued to the Phase II portion of the trial, and again the combination showed no 
unexpected toxicity.  Among the first 25 patients, the response rate was 57%, with 2 CR, and 
many patients were taken to metastatic resection, making interpretation of PFS very difficult.  
Based on the results, a randomized Phase II trial of 160 patients has been proposed for 
ECOG-ACRIN, and will be proposed to the GI Steering Committee in a few months. 
 
2.4 Epigenetic regulation and autophagy 
Adaptive responses to tumor stress such as autophagy require complex coordination, 
influenced by numerous tumor suppressor genes (e.g. TP53, PTEN) and oncogenes (e.g. 
EGFR) as well as epigenetic modification of gene expression.25  While the mutational 
pr
ofiles of tumors have been increasingly well described through efforts such as The Cancer 
Ge
nome Atlas, the role of epigenetic modification in many tumors remains incompletely 
understood.  Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a family of proteins that influence gene 
expression through multiple mechanisms and have been demonstrated to be pathogenic in a 
variety of tumors, including colorectal cancer.27  The HDACs have been classified based on 
homology to yeast proteins into classes I, II, and IV, and at least 11 separate human HDAC 
proteins have been identified.  They initially were shown to alter gene expression through 
cleavage of acetyl-lysine bonds on histones, with resultant alterations in chromatin structure 
and DNA promoter access.28  Additionally, they have been shown to interact with a variety 
o
f non- histone proteins, including p53, E2F, NF-κB, α-tubulin, and heat shock protein 90 
(HS
P90), which may further alter cell-signaling pathways.29 
 
Despite incomplete understanding of the different mechanisms through which HDACs 
e
xert their effects in vivo , small molecule inhibitors of HDACs have shown efficacy in a 
v
ariety of tumor types.  Three HDAC inhibitors, vorinostat, belinostat and romidepsin, 
a
re approved in cutaneous T cell lymphoma, and a fourth HDAC inhibitor, panobinostat, 
is approved in multiple myeloma.   Preclinical mechanistic studies have demonstrated 
multiple antitumor effects, including increased apoptotic death, G1/S cell cycle arrest, 
downregulation of angiogenesis, and modification of tumor immunogenicity.29  The 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 8 relative importance of each of these effects varies considerably based on tumor type and 
specificity of the HDAC inhibitor for the various HDAC isotypes.30  Additionally, the 
a
lterations in cell signaling are highly dependent upon the cellular environment, and 
stre
ssors such as nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, or chemotherapy.  This variability 
hampers the applicability of preclinical models and makes combination therapy effects 
less predictable.  Nevertheless, the benefit of HDAC inhibitor monotherapy in solid 
tum
ors is modest, and promising combinations are emerging.31  Entinostat, also known as 
MS-
275, is an HDAC inhibitor that selectively inhibits class I HDACs, resulting in a 
more favorable side effect profile.32  It is currently undergoing investigation as 
monotherapy and in combination in a variety of tumor types. 
 
Studies in our lab at Penn have shown that HDAC inhibitors are strong inducers of autophagy 
in colon cancer cells lines, especially under hypoxia, and that IC50 values are variable among 
the lines.  Coadministration of the autophagy inhibitor CQ markedly sensitizes the cell lines to 
HDAC inhibition, with CI values that demonstrate marked synergy.  This positive interaction 
is even more enhanced under hypoxic conditions.  The combination of hydroxychloroquine 
and vorinostat was recently shown to be safe in phase I clinical trial.33

Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 9 An extensive literature documents a positive interaction between HDAC inhibitors and 
DNA damaging drugs, but for various reasons this has never been translated effectively to 
the clinic.  These interactions will be explored more fully in a front-line trial with FOLFOX. 
 
2.5  Regorafenib Clinical Experience 
Re
gorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor with effects on angiogenesis via the VEGF 
pathway as well as various cell growth pathways.  It is closely related to sorafenib, 
differing in structure by a single fluorine molecule.  The principle tyrosine kinase targets 
of regorafenib include VEGFR1-3, PDGR-β, KIT, RAF-1, B-RAF, B-RAFV600E, RET, 
and to a lesser extent FGFR2 and TIE2.34 
 
Phase I trials established a dosing regimen of 160 mg daily for 21 days of a 28 day cycle 
and demonstrated hand-foot syndrome, fatigue, diarrhea, and hypertension as the 
predominant side effects.35  Regorafenib demonstrated consistent bioavailability between 
su
bjects.  T 1/2 ranged from 20-40 hours, with relative stability of plasma concentrations 
be
tween doses.  It is metabolized into two pharmacologically active compounds, M2 and 
M5, which reach similar concentrations as the parent compound at steady state. 
 
R
egorafenib is an FDA-approved therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer that has 
progressed on prior therapy with 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, anti-angiogenic 
therapy, and, if KRAS wild-type, anti-EGFR therapy.  This approval was based on a 
proven survival benefit from the phase III CORRECT trial, which compared regorafenib 
to placebo in a 2:1 ratio in colorectal cancer that had progressed on all standard 
therapies.36  Participants randomized to regorafenib in that trial received 160 mg daily for 
th
ree weeks out of a four-week cycle.  Overall survival improved in the regorafenib arm 
to 6.4 months, compared to 5.0 months in the placebo arm (hazard ratio 0.77, 95% CI 
0.64-0.94, p=0.0052.  Grade 3-4 toxicities in this trial with regorafenib included hand-
foot syndrome (17%), fatigue (10%), diarrhea (7%), hypertension (7%), and rash (6%).  
Very few objective responses were seen with regorafenib (1% versus 0.4% with placebo), 
implying a cytostatic effect on the tumor.

Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 10 A se
cond phase III trial conducted in Asia, the CONCUR study, identical in design to the 
CORRECT trial, confirmed the results.37  In this study, overall survival improved with 
r
egorafenib (8.8 months) compared to placebo (6.3 months) (HR 0.55, CI 0.40-0.77, 
p=0.00016).   The objective response rate was 4% in the regorafenib arm.  Grade 3- 4 
adverse events were similar to those seen in the CORRECT trial, including hand-foot 
syndrome (16%), hypertension (11%), liver abnormalities (7% hyperbilirubinemia, 7% 
elevated ALT, 6% elevated AST), hypophosphatemia (7%), lipase elevation (6%), and 
rash (6%).  Additionally, two grade 5 adverse events (cardiac arrest and death NOS) were 
po
ssibly attributable to the drug. 
 
2.6  Hydroxychloroquine Clinical Experience 
Ch
loroquine (CQ) is a synthetic 4-aminoquinoline that has been used for 60 years in 
humans for malaria prophylaxis and treatment,38 rheumatoid arthritis,39 and human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)40. It is an inexpensive orally available drug that has CNS 
penetration. It has a large therapeutic index, and its most predictable cumulative toxicity 
is retinopathy, which can be prevented by discontinuation of the drug.41 It is this toxicity 
a
nd worldwide malarial resistance to CQ that lead to discontinuation of extensive 
research into CQ’s non-malarial applications. Chloroquine derivatives such as HCQ are 
still used extensively in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosis and have a larger 
therapeutic index. The chemical structure of CQ derivatives allows them to serve as a 
weak base which is trapped in acidic cellular compartments.42 Thus chloroquine 
deacidifies lysosomes, inhibiting the last step in autophagy. With this last step blocked, a 
cell reliant on autophagy will increase the generation of autophagosomes and will 
eventually undergo either apoptotic or non-apoptotic cell death. Evidence in mouse 
models and human cancer cell lines suggest CQ may have significant anti- tumor activity 
b
y inhibiting autophagy induced by cancer therapy.43 
 
Adding chloroquine to improve the efficacy of anticancer therapy has already been tested 
in a randomized clinical trial. A small single-institution placebo-controlled phase III trial 
testing the addition of CQ at an oral daily dose of 150 mg to RT and carmustine in 
patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) yielded surprising 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 11 re
sults.44  Median overall survival was significantly longer in the CQ-treated patients (24 
months) than in controls (11 months). At the end of the observation period, six patients 
(40%) treated with CQ were alive at 59, 45, 30, 20 (1 each) and 27 (2 patients) months 
after surgery. In contrast, patients in the control group survived 32, 25, and 22 months. 
Although not statistically significantly different, the rate of death over time was almost 
half as large in the CQ group compared to the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.52 [95% CI, 
0.21 to 1.26]; p= 0.139). 
 
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is commonly prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus at 
doses of 400 mg po daily. A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study of escalating 
doses of HCQ at 400 mg/800 mg/1200 mg po daily in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
followed by maintenance doses of 400 mg po daily found that doses of up to 1200 mg p o 
daily were well tolerated.45 Dose limiting toxicities of nausea, vomiting and abdominal 
pa
in were observed at 800 and 1200 mg po daily. This toxicity correlated with blood 
HCQ levels, but not to blood levels of the other active metabolites, 
desethylhydroxychloroquine (DHCQ), desethylchloroquine (DCQ), or 
bisdesethylchloroquine (BDCQ). Improvement of symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis 
correlated with blood DHCQ levels, suggesting a dose-response relationship. 
Chloroquine derivatives are metabolized through the p450 enzyme system and CQ may 
inhibit the metabolism of CYP2D6- metabolized drugs.45,46 
 
A predictable cumulative toxicity associated with CQ is retinopathy, and this is another 
reason why dose escalation with CQ would be limited. While a link between HCQ and 
retinopathy has also been made, it occurs infrequently and only after a prolonged 
exposure. A study using multifocal electroretinography to detect early pre-clinical retinal 
changes in long-term HCQ users, found that 10 out of 11 patients that developed early 
pre-clinical changes had been taking HCQ at doses of 400 mg po daily for greater than 5 
years.47 No overt retinopathy was noted in the 19 patients followed. This suggests that at 
a
 cumulative dose of 730 g, the risk of retinal changes increases, but techniques such as 
multifocal electroretinography can detect early changes and prevent overt visual loss. 
 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 12 We
 have previously conducted several trials of HCQ in combination with anticancer 
agents ranging from HCQ/alkylating therapy for glioblastoma, through 
HCQ/temsirolimus in Phase I, as well as FOLFOX/bevacizumab/HCQ in colorectal 
cancer. A CNS consortium trial (led from the University of Pennsylvania) to test the 
addition of HCQ at escalating doses to RT/temozolomide found excessive 
my
elosuppression compared to temozolomide alone and reached a daily dose of only 
600
mg HCQ, which incompletely inhibited autophagy and was ineffective in the phase II 
portion.48  With temsirolimus, tolerable doses of HCQ have been higher, and a dose level 
of 1200 mg is currently being explored. Dermatologic effects and fatigue associated with 
mTOR inhibitors do not appear to be worsened by HCQ at doses up to 1000 mg daily. In 
th
e frontline setting for metastatic colorectal cancer, 600mg twice daily dosing was used 
along with FOLFOX as the phase II dose without any additional toxicity. 
 
The pharmacokinetics of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) studied in patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis, malaria, and healthy volunteers demonstrate marked intra- and interpatient 
variability, with a two-fold range in total clearance (4-10 L/h) (26-8). The variability in 
the rate of absorption from oral dosing has been reported to be as high as 87%, 
contributing to differences in peak blood concentrations (Cmax) and time to peak 
concentration (Tmax) among patients receiving identical doses (26-8). Due to its long 
terminal elimination half-life of approximately 40 days, at least 120 days of continuous 
dosing are required before blood HCQ levels reach 90% of steady- state concentrations. 
Predicted blood concentrations are 898 ng/mL and 1796 ng/mL for patients receiving 200 
mg and 400 mg daily of HCQ sulfate, respectively.49  A one- compartment population 
p
harmacokinetic model with a lag time was developed to estimate individual HCQ 
pharmacokinetic parameters in 36 patients who participated in a dose-escalation trial of 
HCQ in conjunction with radiation therapy and temozolomide for glioblastoma 
multiforme48. Population values for apparent volume of distribution (Vd) and total 
clearance were 604 L and 10.7 L/hr, with CV% of 23% and 5%, respectively. Mean 
individual estimated HCQ pharmacokinetic values for Vd were 573 L (range, 205-1291 
L) and clearance 10.5 L/hr (range, 6.8-13.7 L/hr). Mean estimated Cmax values were 
linear and proportional to total daily oral HCQ sulfate doses at 200, 400, 600, and 800 mg

y and consistent with predicted and observed blood concentrations from the published 
literature.50-52  The population pharmacokinetic estimates are comparable to data from a 
pop
ulation pharmacokinetic study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis where the Vd was 
605 L and total clearance was 9.9 L/h.53  Although pharmacokinetic analyses of HCQ 
su
lfate at doses up to 1200 mg daily combined with other agents in phase I and II trials at 
th
e University of Pennsylvania have not been completed, dose-proportional HCQ 
concentrations and concentration-response relationships for daily doses between 400 and 
1200 mg daily have been reported.50 
 
2.7 E
ntinostat Clinical Experience 
Enti
nostat, also known as MS-275, is a synthetic benzamide derivative that has been 
demonstrated to preferentially inhibit class I HDACs, especially HDAC type 1.  
Preclinical animal models of entinostat demonstrated a T max of 30-40 minutes and T 1/2 of 
one hour.  Based on this data, the initial phase I trial of entinostat started dosage at 2 
mg/m2 daily for the first 28 days of a 42 day cycle.54  Both patients on this daily protocol 
experienced dose-limiting toxicity during the first cycle, and pharmacokinetic data 
suggested a half-life of 30-50 times longer than that observed in the animal models.   As a 
result, dosing was changed to biweekly, and all subsequent phase I trials used either 
weekly or biweekly dosing strategies.  Plasma clearance of entinostat in humans follows 
bi-exponential kinetics suggestive of enterohepatic circulation with a T 1/2 of 
approximately 50 hours.  Pharmacodynamic studies have used measurement of histone 
H3 acetylation in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) as a surrogate for HDAC 
inhibition, although this does not nearly reflect the full spectrum of HDAC inhibitor 
a
ctivity.55  Western blot and flow cytometric assays of this using entinostat demonstrated 
sign
ificant interpatient variability in both magnitude and timing of H3 hyperacetylation 
but no clear dose-dependence.56 
 
The most common side effects observed in the initial phase I study were fatigue (100%), 
n
ausea (83%), anorexia (56%), myelosuppression (neutropenia 74%, thrombocytopenia 
61
%, anemia 26%), headache (52%), hypoalbuminemia (48%), and electrolyte 
a
bnormalities (hypocalcemia 43%, hyponatremia 35%, hypophosphatemia 26%).  The

st frequent grade 3 toxicities in the 23 patients were nausea (4), hypophosphatemia 
(4
), fatigue (3), diarrhea (3), and neutropenia (3).  The only grade 4 event was leukopenia 
and neutropenia in a single patient.  The MTD in this study was 10 mg /m2 every 2 weeks. 
 
Additional phase I studies have explored alternative dosing schedules without clear 
de
finition of an optimal regimen.  A dose of 2 mg/m2 twice weekly was excessively toxic 
a
nd discontinued in favor of weekly or biweekly dosing in a phase I trial in patients with 
so
lid tumors and lymphoma.56  All subsequent studies have of entinostat have used 
w
eekly or biweekly dosing.  In a phase I trial in patients with refractory leukemia, 8 
mg/m2 
weekly for the first 4 weeks of a 6-week cycle was determined to be the MTD57  
In a phase I trial in patients with refractory solid tumors, the MTD was 6 mg /m2 weekly 
for the first 4 weeks of a 6-week cycle.58  Later phase II trials used fixed dose instead of 
w
eight-based dosing of entinostat, with a range of doses and weekly or biweekly 
scheduling.59-61  Most recently, a phase I trial of entinostat in combination with sorafenib 
in
 solid tumors demonstrated tolerability of standard full doses of sorafenib (400mg twice 
daily) with entinostat 10 mg every 2 weeks.62  The toxicity profile in this trial was similar 
to that of the initial phase I study, with few events of grade 3 or higher. Therefore the 
combination with regorafenib, an almost identical VEGF-R2 inhibitor, is expected to be 
tolerable. 
 
2.8 Rationale for Clinical Trial 
In summary, previous studies have indicated that autophagy may be a mechanism of 
resistance to both antiangiogenic and cytotoxic drugs.  Multiple phase I trials have shown 
that HCQ is well-tolerated with multiple forms of chemotherapy, and specifically with 
the combination of FOLFOX/bevacizumab in colorectal cancer, as well as with sorafenib.  
Based on very striking (Table 1) preclinical data that support the further addition of 
HDA
C inhibition, this trial is proposed as a test of principle that augmented autophagy 
inhibition can render a purely  antiangiogenic therapy more effective.  Since regorafenib 
a
lone is associated with a 1% response rate, we would view a 15% response rate with the 
combination as promising and worth developing further.

T
able 2:  Dosing Schedule 
Drug  Dose  Route  Schedule  
Regorafenib  160 mg daily  Oral Daily for 21 days of each 
28-day cycle  
Entinostat  2-5 mg weekly  Oral Days 1, 8, 15, and 22  of 
each 28 -day cycle  
Hydroxychloroquine  400-1200  mg daily  Oral Days 1-28 of each 28 -day 
cycle  
 
4.1  Regorafenib Dosing 
All patients will receive regorafenib at the FDA-approved dose of 160 mg by mouth daily 
fo
r days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle.  As noted below, dose decreases of regorafenib are often 
required in the initial cycle, followed by tolerance of full doses in subsequent cycles: 
such manipulations of the regorafenib dose are standard, and will not be taken into 
account in determining the MTD.  Sh o uld excess toxicity attributable to regorafenib be 
repeatedly observed, the principal investigator may institute a standard initial dose 
escalation period.  This will consist of regorafenib 80mg daily for the first 7 days of 
therapy, followed by increase to 120 mg for days 8-14 if 80mg tolerated, and 160 mg for 
da
ys 15 and beyond if 120 mg tolerated. 
 
4.2  Phas
e I Dose Escalation of Hydroxychloroquine and Entinostat 
We expect that the full doses of each drug will be well-tolerated based on previous 
studies.  Patients will begin treatment with weekly oral entinostat and daily oral HCQ 
given in divided doses, per Table 3 below. The starting phase I total daily dose for HCQ 
is 600 mg, based on our previous Phase I trials. Weekly dosing of entinostat has been 
established as the best balance between toxicity due to accumulation and drug 
pharmacodynamics.  Entinostat is currently undergoing study at a dose of 5mg weekly in 
a phase III trial in breast cancer, and 5mg weekly will be the target dose for this study.  
Given the potential for overlapping toxicities in this combination, an initial dose of 3 mg 
w
ill be used, with subsequent escalation. 
 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 19 Th
ree patients will be treated at the starting doses, with escalation to an entinostat dose of 
5mg at dose level 2 followed by dose escalation of HCQ to 1200 mg/daily at dose level 3, 
w
ith expansion to a total of 6 patients once safety has been established.  Dose levels 2A 
a
nd 2B will not be used during the dose escalation phase, they will be used only if de-
e
scalation from dose level 3 is required.  Toxicity attributable to hydroxychloroquine is 
not expected given its excellent tolerability in multiple phase II studies with combination 
c
hemotherapy using 1200 mg per day.  In the event that dose level 3 exceeds the MTD 
(
as described below), provision is made for stepwise dose de-escalation by 200 mg to 
do
se levels 2B (1000 mg total daily dose HCQ) then 2A (800 mg total daily dose HCQ). 
 
B
efore accrual to the next dose level may begin, all patients in the first cohort must 
c
omplete the first 4 weeks of treatment, permitting toxicities to be assessed. The target 
DLT rate is ≤ 33%. The MTD will be defined as a) the dose producing DLT in 1 out of 6 
patients, or b) the dose level below the dose which produced DLT in ≥ 2 out of 3 patients, 
or in ≥ 2 out of 6 patients. The rules for dose escalation and cohort size are outlined in 
T
able 3. No intra-patient dose escalation is planned.

Tablets of HCQ are available in 200 mg strengths. HCQ will be administered in two 
divided doses daily. When taking HCQ twice daily, the two daily doses should be taken 
as close as possible to 12 hours apart. Patients will be instructed to swallow the whole 
tablet in rapid succession without chewing.  Patients receiving antacids, sucralfate, 
c
holestyramine, and/or bicarbonate should have the HCQ and entinostat drug doses 
administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after these medications. 
 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 20 4.3  Phase II Dose
 Expansion 
To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), at least 6 patients must be treated 
at the MTD for 2 cycles.  In order to fulfill this criterion, patients who go off study before 
the completion of 2 cycles for reasons other than toxicity (e.g. disease progression) will 
be replaced in this cohort.  The RP2D will be defined as a dose in which fewer than 33% 
of patients have a DLT and at which chronic administration is tolerated.  To evaluate for 
chronic toxicity, tolerability is defined as 4 out of 6 patients treated for 2 cycles at the 
RP2D receiving during cycle 2: 
1) At least 80% (in total mg per cycle) of the regorafenib dose at which the patient 
begins cycle 2 
2) At least 75% of entinostat doses, with no more than one dose reduction 
3) At least 80% (in total mg per cycle) of the HCQ doses 
 
Should chronic tolerability fail to be demonstrated at the initial RP2D, the previous dose 
level (or a lower dose level at the discretion of the principal investigator) will be 
expanded until at least 6 patients have been treated at this new RP2D for 2 cycles. 
Ev
aluation for chronic tolerability will be performed as above after 2 cycles until the 
RP2D is determined. 
 
After determination of the RP2D, an additional 20 patients will be enrolled at this dose 
le
vel in the Phase II portion. 
 
4.4  Experimental Drug Compliance  
Tre
atment compliance to entinostat and HCQ will be assessed at the end of each cycle. 
Patients will complete a diary to document their weekly intakes. They will be instructed 
to return all unused drugs (partially used and empty containers) and their diary at each 
visit. Site staff will perform accountability of the returned drug and will assess patient 
compliance. Site staff must ensure that the patient clearly understands the directions for 
self-medication and follows the schedule. 
 
 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 21 4.5  DLT Definition and Escalation Decision Process 
Dose
 Limiting Toxicities will be defined by toxicity occurring during the first 4 weeks of 
this study. Any non-hematologic AE of Grade 3 or higher that is judged to be probably 
treatment-relate d will be considered a DLT with the exceptions of fatigue; rash 
a
ttributable to regorafenib; or nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that has improved to Grade < 
1 within 72 hours.  Any non-hematologic AE of Grade 4 or higher of any duration that is 
j
udged to be probably treatment-related will be considered a DLT except for elevations of 
lipase and/or amylase in the absence of clinical pancreatitis. 
 
The following hematologic DLT will be considered if any occurs in the first cycle: 
1) grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 7 days 
2)  febrile neutropenia (T > 100.4 F in presence of ANC <500) 
3)
  platelet count less than 25,000/mm3 
4)
  platelet count less than 50,000/mm3 with clinically significant hemorrhage 
 
If a DLT is observed in exactly 1 patient in the first cohort of 3, the cohort will be 
expanded to 6. If a DLT occurs in 2 or more patients per cohort, then the cohort one dose 
below will be the declared the MTD provided that at least 6 patients have been treated at 
that level with fewer than one third having DLTs. The rules for dose escalation and 
cohort size are outlined in Table 3. No intra-patient dose escalation is planned. 
 
Evaluable Patients:  Patients will be evaluable for toxicity if they have taken one dose of 
HCQ and entinostat.  Patients who experience a dose-limiting toxicity will be evaluable 
fo
r the cohort after at least one dose of HCQ and one dose of entinostat.  To be 
considered for evaluability in a Phase I cohort in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity, 
patients should have completed > 85% of HCQ doses, and at least 3 of 4 entinostat doses.  
Phase II patients will be evaluable for response if they have completed 85% of their 
e
xpected dose of HCQ and at least 3 doses of entinostat in the initial 4 weeks, in the 
a
bsence of progression. Patients who do not meet these criteria will be replaced. In the 
unexpected event of excess toxicity at dose level 1, there is provision (Table 3) for a dose 
reduction of both HCQ and entinostat.

treatment unless there is a need for a dose decrease for toxicity.  These DLT decisions ar e 
a
ssuming the toxicity is characteristic of entinostat or HCQ. 
 
DL
T determination is complex in this three-drug combination, and should the DLT 
toxicities be more likely associated with regorafenib, a lower dose of regorafenib may be 
r
equired. 
 
4.6 Duration of Treatment 
Pa
tients will continue therapy on 28-day cycles until disease progression or the 
constraints of this therapy are deemed to be detrimental to the patient’s health. In this 
event, the protocol should be discontinued. Furthermore, the protocol will be 
discontinued should the patient withdraw consent.  All patients in whom protocol therapy 
has been discontinued will be followed for progression of disease and survival. 
 
4.7  Measurement of Response 
Pa
tients will be assessed on regularly prescribed intervals in order to determine if there is 
e
vidence of disease progression. A CT or MRI of the abdomen/pelvis and chest (if 
thoracic disease is present) will be obtained at 8 and 16 weeks, then every 8-12 weeks per 
standard practice. 
 
 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 23 4.8  Laboratory Testing 
Pa
tients will have laboratory testing at the pre-treatment screening visit, cycle 1 day 1, and 
cycle 1 day 15 as described in the schedule of events (Appendix A), including complete 
b
lood count with differential and comprehensive metabolic panel with magnesium and 
p
hosphorous.  Complete blood counts will be continued every two weeks until week 8, and 
then every four weeks if the hematologic toxicity is tolerable.  Comprehensive metabolic 
pa
nel, magnesium, and phosphorous will be checked every 4 weeks after the initial testing 
un
less there is concerning toxicity.  CEA will be checked at baseline, and, if it is elevated 
a
bove the laboratory upper limit of normal, will be checked on day 1 of each 28-day cycle.  
Prothrombin time (PT) and activated prothromboplastin time (aPTT) will be checked at 
ba
seline.  Patients on non-prophylactic anticoagulation will have a complete blood count 
weekly for cycles 1 and 2, and every 2 weeks with subsequent cycles. 
 
For correlative pharmacodynamic testing, blood samples for peripheral blood mononuclear 
c
ells (PBMCs) will be obtained on cycle 1 day 1 (prior to therapy administration), cycle 1 
da
y 2, and cycle 1 day 15.  As in our previous study, autophagy inhibition will be assessed 
u
sing western analysis of autophagy markers in PBMCs.   HDAC inhibition will be 
m
easured through multiparametric flow cytometric analysis of histone and non-histone 
tar
gets of de-acetylation enzymes in PBMCs63 in collaboration with Dr Jane Trepel, NIH.  
I
n addition, the effects of the treatment on lymphocyte subsets will be analyzed by flow 
cytometry.64  The procedures for this are further described in the laboratory manual. 
 
4.9  Tum
or Biopsy  
All
 patients receiving treatment on this trial should have available archival tumor tissue 
for analysis.  This tissue should be that which was procured at the time of diagnosis and 
prior to treatment either through colonoscopic biopsy, surgical excision, or core biopsy of 
a metastatic site.  Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue will suffice. About 20 
unstained slides, 5 microns thick will be requested.  During the phase II portion of the 
stu
dy, additional tumor biopsy samples will be obtained in consenting patients with 
accessible disease between day 15 and day 22 of cycle 1, as permitted by scheduling of 
the procedure.  In these paired biopsy samples, analysis of antigens including FOXO1 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 24 ex
pression, localization, phosphorylation, and acetylation will be performed before and 
after treatment.  Gene expression will also be analyzed in these patients by RNA-Seq and 
c
ytokine analysis will be performed in collaboration with Drs Downes and Evans at Salk. 
 
4.10  Gene Expression Profiling  
Fo
r the tumor genomic characterization, we plan to submit all patients’ baseline tumor 
biopsies for NGS analysis in a CLIA-approved test developed in the Department of 
Pathology at Penn (CPD Solid Tumor Panel, version 2), or equivalent, or more in-depth 
analysis as funding may permit. 
 
5.0  DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
Toxicity will be graded using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria, CTCAE v. 4.03, which 
is a
vailable on the NCI website www.ctep.cancer.gov .  As specified in the following 
tables, dose modification should be based upon the worst grade of toxicity experienced. 
Dose reductions should be continued for subsequent cycles.  Ex c eptions may be made 
after discussion with the Principal Investigator. 
 
5.1.  Regorafenib 
Interrupt regorafenib for the following: 
• NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 grade 2 hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) [palmar-plantar 
erythrodysesthesia (PPE)] that is recurrent or does not improve within 7 days despite 
dose reduction; interrupt therapy for a minimum of 7 days for grade 3 HFSR 
• Symptomatic Grade 2 hypertension 
• Any NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction attributable to regorafenib 
 
Reduce the dose of regorafenib to 120 mg: 
• For the first occurrence of Grade 2 HFSR of any duration 
• After recovery of any Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction attributed to regorafenib 
•
 For Grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
elevation (see Note below) 
 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 25 Reduce the dose of regorafenib to 80 mg: 
• For re-occurrence of Grade 2 HFSR at the 120 mg dose 
• After recovery of any Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction at the 120 mg dose (except 
hepatotoxicity) 
 
Discontinue regorafenib permanently for the following: 
• Failure to tolerate 80 mg dose 
• Any occurrence of AST or ALT more than 20 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
Grade 4 
• Any occurrence of AST or ALT more than 3 times ULN with concurrent bilirubin more 
than 2 times ULN 
• For any of the following complications:  gastrointestinal perforation/fistula, hemorrhage 
(severe or life-threatening), reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), 
wound dehiscence 
 
Note:   With regorafenib, as many as a third of patients may require dose decreases.  
T
hese can often be temporary and patients can often be re-dosed at starting doses after 
r
esolution of toxicity. 
 
5.2  Entinostat 
All dose modifications should be based on the AE requiring the greatest modification and 
should be properly documented in source documents. Investigators may take a more 
conservative approach than the guidelines outlined below on the basis of clinical 
judgment that is in the best interest of the subject. 
 
Management of toxicities that are at least possibly related to entinostat, with toxicities 
graded by the Investigator according to the NCI, CTCAE, version 4.03 should be 
managed as follows:

 5.3.1  Dose Modification for Hydroxychloroquine 
Any AE of ≥ Grade 3 and attributed as possibly, probably or definitely related to HCQ 
will result in the dose being held until the AE has resolved to ≤ grade 1 or baseline. If the 
A
E resolves, reinstitution of treatment can occur at either the previous or reduced dose as 
described in Table 2 at the discretion of the investigator. 
 
If the AE recurs at the reduced dose, treatment will be held until the AE has resolved to ≤ 
grade 1 and when resolved treatment can be reinstituted at the next lower dose level. 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 28  
To
xicities that may be attributable to HCQ include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and 
visual field deficit. If any of these AEs occur at grade ≤ 2, HCQ may be continued and 
the AE managed with supportive care. For any AE with a grade ≥ 3, the dose of HCQ 
should be held until the toxicity resolves to grade 1 (or is found to be unrelated to HCQ). 
 
W
ith particular regard to visual field deficits patients should be cautioned to report any 
visual symptoms, particularly difficulty seeing entire words or faces, intolerance to glare, 
decreased night vision, or loss of peripheral vision. These symptoms of periphera l 
retinal toxicity should prompt drug discontinuation and ophthalmologic evaluation.

7.0  STATISTICS 
7.1  Primary Endpoints 
7.1.1  Phase I 
The Phase I methodology will be a standard Phase I escalating trial with three patients 
per level, expanding to six patients per level in the event of dose-limiting toxicity at any 
level, and provision for expansion to 20 additional patients at the recommended Phase II 
do
se to better characterize the optimal dose and the variation in toxicity at that level. A 
m
inimum of 4 weeks of combination therapy with hydroxychloroquine, entinostat, and 
r
egorafenib are required in the third patient before escalation to the next dose is initiated. 
At the MTD, at least 6 patients must be treated for 2 cycles to evaluate chronic toxicity 
and determine the RP2D (see section 4.3 for details). 
 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 35 We
 will calculate the percentage of subjects with toxicities at each dose level. We expect 
that doses close to full single agent doses will be tolerable.  Three patients will be 
in
itially treated at each dose level.  The plan for escalation is described below: 
 
Three patients will initially be treated at each dose level. 
 
I
f 0/3 patients experience DLT, then the dose will be escalated. 
 
If 2-3/3 patients experience DLT, then the MTD has been exceeded. Three additional 
patients are treated at the previous dose (if only 3 had been treated) as a total of 6 patients 
must be treated at the MTD. 
 
If 1/3 patients experience DLT, then 3 additional patients are treated. If none of the 
additional patients develop DLT, then the dose will be escalated, otherwise escalation 
ceases and the previous dose will be expanded to a total of 6 patients. 
 
To assure safety in this phase I study, the operating characteristics of the escalation rule 
to be employed have been determined. The operating characteristics denote the 
probability of escalation to the next dose level, for a given true DLT rate. For a true DLT 
that is high, we desire the probability of escalation to be low. As noted in the table, the 
probability of escalating beyond a certain dose level, if that dose level truly has a 10% 
DLT rate, is 0.91. On the other hand, if the true DLT rate is 40%, there is only a 31% 
chance of dose escalation.

.1.2  Phase II 
Single agent regorafenib showed ORR of 1% in phase III trials in advanced colorectal cancers. 
W
e anticipate being able to improve this response rate substantially, perhaps to 15% or more. 
W
e will enroll a total 26 patients at the RP2D, including those treated during the phase I 
por
tion of the study.  Sample size calculations are based on an assumption of at least 20 
e
valuable patients.  With 20 patients, an exact binomial test with a 0.05 one-sided significance 
le
vel will have 84% power to detect an improvement from the historical rate (null hypothesis 
proportion) of 1% to an improved rate (alternative proportion) of 15 %. 
 
7.2  S
econdary endpoints 
Progression-free survival, overall survival, and duration of response will be calculate d 
with 95% confidence intervals.  Toxicity rates will also be calculated by category with 
95% confidence intervals.  With 20 subjects, we have a 88% chance of observing, at least 
o
nce, any toxicity occurring at a rate of 10% or higher. 
 
We will use response as the primary efficacy marker to investigate the relationship 
between changes in autophagy and protein lysine acetylation markers and the efficacy of 
treatment.  We will summarize time- to-event outcomes (time to progression, survival 
time and duration of response) with Kaplan-Meier survival curves. We will also analyze 
toxicity including changes in counts, and degree of non-hematologic toxicity, according 
to the pharmacodynamic markers.  Analyses of mutational profiles and correlatives from 
tumor biopsies (if obtained) will be exploratory. 
 
7.3  Sample Size/Accrual Rate 
Phase I: The phase I study will involve six possible dose levels, although accrual at more 
th
an 3 or 4 levels is very unlikely. The total sample size will range from a minimum of 12 
to a maximum of 24 patients. We expect accrual to be completed within 6-9 months. 
 
P
hase II: During the Phase II portion we will enroll up to 20 additional patients and 
ex
pect an accrual time of approximately 1 year. 
 
7.4  Statistical Software 
All analyses, except as otherwise noted, will be performed using either SAS or STATA.

Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 37 8.0  SAF
ETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS 
8.1 Definitions 
8.1.1  Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of the study. The CTC version 4.0 will be used to 
grade toxicity. Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events. 
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the 
abnormality: 
 Results in study withdrawal 
 Is associated with a serious adverse event 
 Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
 Leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests 
 Is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance 
8.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event 
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious. A serious adverse event is any 
AE that is: 
 Fatal 
 Life-threatening 
 Requires or prolongs hospital stay 
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 A congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 An important medical event 
 Pregnancy 
8.1.3  Important Medical Events 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are 
clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the patient, and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above. All adverse events 
that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious adverse 
events. 
 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 38 8.2.  Post-
study  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by the investigator until the events are 
resolved, the patient is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained. At 
th
e last scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct each patient to report any 
subsequent event(s) that the patient, or the patient’s personal physician, believes might 
reasonably be related to participation in this study. 
 
8.3  Abnormal Laboratory Values 
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if the 
abnormality is of a degree, typically at least grade 2 and not present as grade 1 or higher 
at baseline, that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, discontinuation of the 
drug, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic investigation. 
 
8.4  Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery 
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be 
documented and reported as a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed 
otherwise in this protocol. Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented 
as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event. 
 
Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported 
as an adverse event in the following circumstances: 
 Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical procedures 
for a preexisting condition. Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse 
event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was 
uneventful. 
 Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization required to allow efficacy measurement for 
the study. 
 Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for therapy of the target disease of the study, 
unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospital admissions as judged by the 
clinical investigator. 
 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 39 8.5 Re
cording of Adverse Events 
At each contact with the patient, the investigator must seek information on adverse events by 
specific questioning and, as appropriate, by examination. Information on all adverse events 
should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse 
event module of the case report form (CRF). All clearly related signs, symptoms, and 
abnormal diagnostic procedures results should recorded in the source document, though 
should be grouped under one diagnosis. All adverse events occurring during the study period 
must be recorded. The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, 
stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the 
cause. Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be 
followed up to determine the final outcome. Any serious adverse event that occurs after the 
study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study 
participation should be recorded and reported immediately. 
 
8.6 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
8.6.1 Study Sponsor Notification by Investigator 
A serious adverse event must be reported to the study sponsor within 24 hours of the 
event. Report serious adverse events by phone and facsimile to:

F
ax: 215-349-8551 
or via the HUP page operator at 215-662-4000 
 
At the time of the initial report, the following information should be provided: 
• Study identifier 
• Study Center 
• Patient number 
• A description of the event 
• Date of onset 
• Current status 
• Whether study treatment was discontinued 
• The reason why the event is classified as serious 
• Investigator assessment of the association between the event and study treatment 
 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 40 8.
6.2 IRB Notification by Investigator-sponsor 
Reports of all serious adverse events (including follow-up information) must be 
submitted to the IRB within 10 working days, according to IRB guidelines. 
 
Reporting Process to IRB 
Principal Investigators are required to submit reports of unanticipated problems posing 
r
isks to subjects or others that are probably or definitely study related via the HS-ERA 
system within 10 working days of the event. 
 
For reportable deaths, the initial submission to the IRB may be made by contacting the 
appropriate IRB coordinator as soon as the death is known, with a report via HS-ERA 
within 10 days if death is from underlying disease and within 24 hours if study related 
activity is considered contributory to the death. 
 
8.6.3 FDA Notification by Investigator-sponsor, Voluntary 
T
he study sponsor shall notify the FDA by telephone or by facsimile transmission of any 
unexpected fatal or life-threatening experience associated with the use of the drug as soon 
as possible but no later than 7 calendar days from the sponsor’s original receipt of the 
information. If a previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable is later 
found to fit the criteria for reporting, the study sponsor will submit the adverse event in a 
written report to the FDA as soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days from the 
time the determination is made. 
 
8.6.4  Sponsor Notification 
The investigator must inform Syndax in writing using a SAE form or MEDWATCH 
3500A form of any SAE within 24 hours of being aware of the event.  The date of 
awareness should be noted on the report.  The written report must be completed and 
supplied to Syndax within 24 hours/1 business day at the latest on the following working 
day.  The initial report must be as complete as possible, including details of the current 
illness and (serious) adverse event, and an assessment of the causal relationship between 
the event and the investigational product(s).  Information not available at the time of the 
initial report (e.g., an end date for the adverse event or laboratory values received after 
the report) must be documented on a follow-up report.  A final report to document

9.0. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING 
9.1  Confidentiality 
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). 
Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following: 
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study 
 Who will have access to that information and why 
 Who will use or disclose that information 
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of 
subject authorization. For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, 
a
ttempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the 
subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period 
 
9.2  Source Documents

10.0  M
EASUREMENT OF EFFECT 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca 45:228-247, 2009]. Changes in the largest diameter 
(
unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case 
of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. 
 
10.1 Definitions 
Evaluable for toxicity: All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their 
first treatment on study. 
 
Evaluable for objective response: Only those patients who have measurable disease present at 
baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated 
will be considered evaluable for response. These patients will have their response classified 
according to the definitions stated below. (Note: Patients who exhibit objective disease 
progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.) 
 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 43 Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response: Patients who have lesions present at baseline 
that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at 
least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will be considered 
e
valuable for non-target disease. The response assessment is based on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions. 
 
10.2 Disease Parameters 
Measurable disease: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm by chest 
x-ray, as >10 mm with CT scan, or >10 mm with calipers by clinical exam. All tumor 
measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters). 
 
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be >15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease: All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non-measurable. 
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) 
since they are, by definition, simple cysts. 
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions. 
 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 44 Target lesions: All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions 
in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and 
recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their 
size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It 
may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible 
measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured 
reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, 
short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short 
axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. 
 
Non-target lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow-up. 
 
10.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment 
and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
e
ach identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam. 
 
10.3.1 Clinical lesions 
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and <10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 45 ski
n nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including 
a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
 
10.3.2  Conventional CT and MRI 
T
his guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption 
that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 
mm
, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI 
is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans). 
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement. Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the 
technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at 
follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the RECIST 
guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans 
should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
 
10.3.3 PET- CT 
At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET- CT is 
n
ot always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements. 
However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT is of 
identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT 
portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time. 
Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias 
an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed. 
 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 46 10.
3.4 Ultrasound 
Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method 
of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment 
to the next. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, 
confirmation by CT or MRI is advised. If there is concern about radiation exposure at 
CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances. 
 
10.3.5 Tumor markers 
Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially above the 
upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete 
clinical response. 
 
10.3.6 Cytology, Histology 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease. 
 
10.3.7 FDG-PET 
While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable 
to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment 
of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG-
PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm: 
• Ne gative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion. 
• No  FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: If the positive 
FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this 
is PD. If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on CT, additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is 
truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 47 init
ial abnormal FDG-PET scan). If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up 
corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. 
 
Note: A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
 
10.4 Response Criteria 
10.4.1.  Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters 
 
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if 
that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum mus t 
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or 
more new lesions is also considered progressions). 
 
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study 
 
10.4.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis) 
 
Note: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize 
for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. 
 
Non-CR/Non-PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits 
 
 UPCC 31216 (IRB # 827226) 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 :   06/15/2017 48 Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally 
trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a 
single lesion increase. 
 
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of 
the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status 
should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator). 
 
10.4.3  Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment 
will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Note: Patients wit h a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progres sion even after discontinuation of treatment.

10.4.3 Duration of Response 
Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first 
date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented. 
 
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until 
the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

  HCQ will be administered according to Section 4.2 (days 1-28).  See Section 5.0 for dose modifications. 
B:  Regorafenib will be administered at 160 mg (Days 1-21), unless adjusted as per Section 4.1.  See 
Section 5.0 for dose modifications. 
C:  Entinostat will be administered according to Section 4.2 (Days 1, 8, 15, 22).  See Section 5.0 for dose 
modifications. 
1:  The pre-study visit must be within 28 days of starting therapy (Cycle 1 Day 1).  Office visits should 
occur within 1 week of the originally scheduled date.  Longer delays should be discussed with the 
principal investigator. 
2:  Complete physical exam will be completed at baseline; focused physical examinations will be 
conducted thereafter. 
3:  Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, temperature 
4:  After Cycle 2, done Day 1 of each cycle, provided that hematologic toxicity is tolerable.  Patients on 
non-prophylactic anticoagulation must have CBC weekly for cycles 1 and 2 and every 2 weeks with 
subsequent cycles. 
5:  Screening or Cycle 1 Day 1 only. 
6:  Na, K, Ca, Mg, phosphorus, BUN, creatinine, glucose, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, tota l 
bilirubin, albumin, total protein.   After Cycle 1, done Day 1 of each cycle unless concerning toxicity 
7:  CEA will be checked at baseline.  If it is elevated, it will be checked on day 1 of each cycle, otherwise 
it will not be routinely followed. 
8:  Serum B-HCG will be checked at screening and either urine or serum B-HCG must be checked within 
3 days of initiation of study drug 
9:  Radiologic evaluations (CT preferred, MRI acceptable; PET/CT only if required per treating 
physi
cian) of the abdomen/pelvis and chest (if thoracic disease is present) and tumor measurements will 
be performed at baseline (within 4 weeks of study therapy), at Cycle 3 Day 1 and Cycle 5 Day 1 (or 
wi
thin 2 weeks), then every 8-12 weeks per standard practice. Scans may be evaluated for texture analysis 
as a baseline for exploratory radiomic endpoints. 
10:  Sample handling as in Laboratory Manual. 
11:  Tumor biopsies to be taken in phase II portion (when funding obtained) in subjects who meet 
eli
gibility at Cycle 1 between day 15 and day  22 if possible.  Archived tumor material prior to treatment 
wi
ll also be analyzed, as discussed in section 4.9.

ndix B:  Concomitant Medications to Avoid 
 
Examples of sensitive in vivo CYP substrates and CYP substrates with narrow therapeutic range 
are summarized below.  
 
Examples of substrates that may be affected by entinostat 
CYP Enzymes   
 Substrates with narrow therapeutic range1 
CYP1A2  Theophylline, tizanidine  
CYP2C8   
 Paclitaxel  
CYP3A2  Alfentanil, astemizole 3, cisapride 3, cyclos porine, dihydroergotamine, 
ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, 
terfenadine 3  
 
1   CYP substrates with narrow therapeutic range refers to drugs whose exposure-response 
relationship indicates that small increases in their exposure levels by the concomitant use of 
CYP inhibitors may lead to serious safety concerns (e.g., Torsades de Pointes).  
2   Because a number of CYP3A substrates (e.g., darunavir, maraviroc) are also substrates of P-
gp, the observed increase in exposure could be due to inhibition of both CYP3A and P-gp.

ndix C:  Medically Acceptable Methods of Birth Control  
 
Females: 
Women of child-bearing potential (as per section 3.1.8) must agree to use 2 of the following 
forms of contraception OR completely refrain from intercourse during the study and for at least 
120 days following the last dose of study drug. 
 
Males: 
Men with partners of child-bearing potential (as per section 3.1.8) must agree along with their 
partner to use 2 of the following forms of contraception OR completely refrain from intercourse 
during the study and for at least 120 days following the last dose of study drug. 
 
Acceptable methods include: 
 Condoms 
 Diaphragm 
 Cervical cap 
 Intra-uterine device 
 Surgical sterilization (tubal ligation or vasectomy) 
 Oral contraceptives 
 
Abstinence at certain times of the cycle, such as during ovulation or after ovulation, or 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods.  The list of methods is not exhaustive and additional 
contraception methods not included above may also be acceptable.  The study doctor must 
approve the contraceptive methods in subjects with child-bearing potential.

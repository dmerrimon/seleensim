2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
2.1 The incidence of multiple myeloma (MM) has been on the rise with an estimated  
15,000 new cases being predicted in 2004, accounting for approximately 13% of 
all hematological malignancies (1).  The entire spectrum of plasma cell dyscrasias 
affects an even greater percentage of the population.  Thes e diseases include 
benign gammopathy, macroglobulinemia, solitary plasmacytoma and, within the 
category of MM, smoldering and indol ent forms as well as immunoblastic 
lymphoma and plasma cell leukemia (2).  Adverse prognostic factors such as high 
plasma cell labeling index, elevated beta-2 microglobulin, low albumin at 
diagnosis, the presence of specific ch romosomal abnormalities, plasmablastic 
morphology and abnormal renal function, poor  performance status at diagnosis 
and elevated serum levels of interleukin-6 are of grave clinical significance (3-6). 
Chemotherapy with melphalan and pre dnisone, a combination of alkylating 
agents, or vincristine, doxorubicin and de xamethasone is effective in 50-70% of 
patients with newly diagnosed MM; however , less than 10% of  patients will 
achieve complete remission (7,8).  Unfortunately, the effects of chemotherapy are 
RB #04064     4     10-6-11 
Version: 12 
 usually short lasting. This l ack of long-term effectiveness is due to either prim ary, 
or acquired resistance.  Attempts to  improve overall response and response 
duration have been focusing on overc oming drug resistance due to over 
expression of the MDR-1 gene product (9),  or utilizing myeloablative therapy 
followed by allogeneic, or autologous bone marrow, or peripheral blood 
progenitor cell rescue (PBPC) (10).  There has been a statistically significant but 
moderate trend with improved 5-year re lative survival rates ranging from 24 
months to 31 months, when comparing patients treated from 1974-76, 1983-85, 
and 1992 through 1999 (1). While recent incorporation of both older, 
rediscovered agents (thalidomide), and newly developed classes of drugs 
(bortezomib) have contribut ed to our ability to better control the myelomatous 
process both as initial a nd salvage therapy, the long-term impact of these and 
other agents under developm ent is still unknown (11,12). 
  2.2 High-dose chemo-/radiothera py in the treatment of MM. 
   
Single agent high-dose melphalan therapy results in response ra tes of > 80% with 
complete response rates of >30% as desc ribed in earlier studi es, but pancytopenia-
related toxicities without the use of ste
m cell support are substantial.   In an 
update, 1/3 of the patients from an early cohort treated with high-dose melphalan were reported to be alive at 9 years (13).  Thousands of patients with multiple myeloma have received dose-intense bone marrow ablative therapy followed by autologous bone marrow, or peripheral stem cell rescue. Following such 
interventions, increased complete remissi on rates have been reported in selected 
cohorts of patients with good performan ce status and already limited tumor 
burden at the time of initiating high-dos e therapy (10).  Induction regimens 
consisting of total body radiation w ith cyclophosphamide or melphalan, 
melphalan alone, or combination chemothe rapy, have resulted in similar outcome 
(14-17). A prospective randomized st udy comparing high-dose consolidation 
therapy and stem cell rescue following induction therapy vs. conventional chemotherapy alone, yielded higher complete  response rates (22% versus 5%) and 
improved progression-free and overall su rvival following high-dose therapy; 
projected 5 year event-free and overall su rvivals were 28% and 52% versus 10% 
and 12%, thereby establishing the role of high-dose chem otherapy as standard, for 
patients with multiple myeloma (18). A second trial yielded similar results, with a median survival of 54 months versus 42 months favoring outcome for patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy (19).  Comparison of early vs. late (at the 
time of progression) autologous transp lant favors early high-dose therapy, 
resulting in prolonged progression-free su rvival and better quality of life (20). 
Tandem cycle high-dose chemo/radiotherapy in the setting of “total therapy” in 
the largest series by a single institution suggested additional benefit associated with the second transplant in  a series of 231 patients, independent of the presence 
of unfavorable cytogenetics and elevated  beta 2 microglobulin; with a median 
follow-up of 4.2 years among surviving pati ents actuarial 5-year event-free and 
overall survivals were 58% and 42%, respectively (4).  More recently, a 
prospective randomized trial of tandem  cycle high-dose therapy consisting of 
melphalan 140 mg/m
2 first, followed by melphalan 140 mg/m2 and total body 
RB #04064     5     10-6-11 
Version: 12 
 irradiation with 8 Gy versus single cycle high-dose melphalan 140 mg/m2 and 
total body irradiation with 8 Gy resulted in  a 20% probability of 7-year event-free 
survival versus 10% (21).    
 
  Allogeneic bone marrow transplantati on has resulted in a disappointing median 
overall survival of 13 months as describe d in a registry review by the European 
Group for Blood and Bone Marrow Transp lantation, with approximately 40% 
early,
 treatment-related mortality (22).   More recent da ta suggest diminished early 
mortality rates possible due to incorporat ion of PBPC reinfusi ons, in addition to 
the increased non-myeloablat ive transplants (23-24). 
   Early utilization of my eloablative therapy is reco mmended both with autologous 
and allogeneic bone ma 
rrow transplantation in order to consolidate complete or 
partial response to c onventional treatment.   
 
2.3 High-dose Chemotherapy Regime ns in Multiple Myeloma 
 
The most frequently used single high-dos e regimens in an autologous stem  cell 
transplant setting include melphalan alone, or in combination with busulfan, cyclophosphamide, or with fractionated to tal body irradiation. (16, 17) There are 
no definitive comparative studies evalua ting these regimens, except for melphalan 
200 mg/m
2 versus melphalan 140 mg/m2 and FTBI 8 Gy. (14).  In a comparative, 
randomized, prospective study patients treat ed with melphalan alone experienced 
better projected 45-month overall survival rates of ~66% versus ~ 46%, but event-
free survivals were equivalent. Toxici ties, especially cytopenias were 
substantially worse in the me lphalan/FTBI-treated cohort. 
 
2.4 Rationale for total m arrow irradiation (TMI) in multiple myeloma 
 
Rapid advances in computer and medica l imaging technologies have resulted in 
the ability to deliver radiotherapy w ith greater precision and conforma
lity. 
External beam radiotherapy has traditionally relied on radiologic imaging to direct 
therapy to appropriate anatomic regions . The integration of CT imaging into 
radiation treatment planning, allows for a three dimensional view of each patient’s 
tumor relative to dose-limiting adjacent normal organs, allowing for customized beam shaping, beam orientation and dose conformality. The use of 3D conformal 
radiotherapy allows for further escalati on of dose, which has resulted in higher 
tumor control, while maintaining risks and side effects at acceptable levels.   Intensity modulated radia tion therapy (IMRT) has opene d a new era in radiation 
oncology. By delivering therapy from multiple directions using multiple 
segm
ented or modulated beamlets, one can now sculpt radiation doses to fit the 
unique shape of each patient’s tumor, optimizing radiation delivery to complex volumes and regions of the body. Some co mpare IMRT to “painting” radiation 
with a finer brush, where more precise, c onformal and sophisticat ed dose patterns 
are now possible. This has also resulted in a greater degree of conformal dose 
avoidance of adjacent normal organs. Dose  escalation is now possible with 
RB #04064     6     10-6-11 
Version: 12 
 IMRT, which was not possible with tec hnology just a decade ago. For example, 
radiation
 doses for prostate cancer, which have been limited to approximately 
7000 cGy with conventional technologies , are now >8000 cGy using IMRT. As a 
result, a significant improvement in tumo r control and a reduction in bladder and 
rectal toxicities have been reported (25). 
 Helical tomotherapy (HT) represents the next major breakthrough in bea
 m 
delivery systems. HT is a ground break ing, FDA approved radiation therapy 
delivery device, which is a marriage of spiral CT and IMRT technology. 
Specifically, a 6 MV linear accelerator is mounted on a CT ring gantry and rotates 
around the patient as the patient transl ates through the ring. The treatment fan 
beam is segmented using a 64-leaf coll imator. Each leaf casts a 0.6 mm width 
shadow at 85 cm isocenter di stance with the fan beam, which varies in width from 
0.5 to 5 cm. The minimum voxel or beamlet size is therefore 5 x 6 mm. By rapid 
opening and closing of leaves as a function of gantry angle while the patient slides 
trough the ring, helical tomotherapy provi des unprecedented ability to sculpt 
radiation doses to complex shaped tumo r regions while simu ltaneously avoiding 
dose to normal organs (26, 27).  Grigorov et al. (28) evaluating HT treatment 
plans for prostate cancer, demonstrated rapid drop-off of dose around the target 
(prostate gland) in all directions resulti ng in excellent sparing of rectum, bladder 
and femoral heads superior to prior IMRT techniques. Scrimger et al. (29) predicted that for select patients with lung cancer, tumor doses as high as 16,000 
cGy will be achievable while maintaining no rmal lung doses (and therefore risks) 
at comparable levels as with conventi onal delivery methods, which are limited to 
doses of 6,000 cGy to the tumor in most patients.  In addition, an array of detectors m ounted on the same rotating gantry and 
position
ed directly opposed to the beam s ource, gives the HT delivery system two 
unique capabilities not found on any other deli very systems. Firs t, these detectors 
allow for the generation of megavoltage  CT (MVCT) images using the 6 MV 
beam. Resolution and contrast of MVCT  i s  m o r e  t h a n  a d e q u a t e  t o  e a s i l y  
distinguish tissue planes a nd organ boundaries (26), as shown in the figure below. 
This allows the HT system to automatica lly align beam orientation to anatomic 
external landmarks and internal organs in 3 dimensions prior to each daily session, vastly improving the precision of radiation de livery. Second, these same 
arrays can be used to monitor output of  the beam as it exits through the patient, 
providing an additional level of dose verification. In the future, it is anticipated that future software and hardware modifications will allow for this type of  “adaptive radiotherapy” to occur in real time, consta ntly modulating beam output 
to account for minute-by-minute varia tions in tumor and organ motion.

  The advent of HT brings for the first time to the clinic the potential to deliver  highly conformi
ng dose distributions to la rge complex target shapes. For example, 
 with HT shaping the dose to the en tire pleural surface, while sparing lung 
 parenchyma is now possible for patients with mesothelioma.   
At the City of Hope, TBI is  often used as part of the preparato
 ry regimen for 
many patients undergoing bone marrow transp lants. Although TBI will effectively 
treat the target region which includes th e marrow space, and, in some patients, 
extramedullary hematopoietic sites, such  as spleen and lymph nodes, TBI also 
delivers the same dose to all other normal organs resulting in dose-limiting toxicity, such as nausea and vomiting, mu cositis and pneumonitis. Working with 
collaborators at the University of  Wisconsin and Tomotherapy, Inc. 
(manufacturers of HT), we have recently  evaluated the feasibility of delivering 
conformal radiation doses to just the sk eletal bone containing the marrow spaces 
as a possible alternative to TBI. Total marrow irradiation (TMI) using HT would 
dramatically reduce dose to normal tissu es, reducing short-term and long-term 
toxicities.  Using whole body CT imag es captured on the COH Radiation 
Oncology Picker CT treatment planning syst em, normal organs and target skeletal 
bone compartments were contoured. After defining appropriate target and organ 
dose constraints, i nverse planning using the HT pl anning station was used to 
generate dose distributions and dose vol ume histograms. An example of a TMI 
dose distribution plan is shown in the accompanying figure.

TBI remains a part of the preparator y regimen for many patients undergoing 
transplantation for hematologic malignanc ies. There have been a few clinical 
trials evaluating the feasibility of increasing TBI dose in an effort to improve 
outcomes. A phase III randomized trial compared 12 Gy + Cytoxan vs. 15.75 Gy 
TBI + Cytoxan in patients with AML.  Th e 3-year probability of relapse was 35% 
for the 12 Gy group and 12% for the 15.75 Gy group (1). A similar study was carried out by the same group of investigat ors for CML. The four year probability 
of relapse was 25% for the 12 Gy gr oup and 0% for the 15.75 Gy group (2). 
However in both studies survival was not  improved due to increased transplant 
related mortality at the higher TBI dose.  Appelbaum concluded that relatively 
small changes in TBI dose can result in significant increases in anti-leukemic effects, but also resulted in increase s in toxicities, prim arily of the lung, mucus  
membranes and liver (3). Therefore bene
fit was established for dose escalation, 
but a more targeted form of radiation th erapy was needed to allow for further dose 
escalation without excessive toxicities (3).  Multip le myeloma is also a 
radiosensitive malignancy with improved response ra tes after myeloablative 
therapies. However, incorporation of TB I into conditioning regimens has been 
challenging due to associat ed increased toxicities. 
 The tables below compare TBI as currently done at COH with TMI. Dose estimates for COH conventional TBI (with 50% lung blocks and electron boost to 
the chest wall) and helical tom
othera py TMI were recently generated on our 
treatment planning stations in the same pa tient (adult female). Both plans used a 
prescribed dose of 1200 cGy. Table 1 compares the minimum dose for TBI vs. 
TMI for normal organs. There is a 1.4 to  10.6-fold reduction of minimum dose to 
normal organs with TMI compared to TBI.                     Table 1. Comparison of minimum dose to normal organs with TBI vs. TMI

organs. There is a 1.6 to 5.4-fold reduc tion in normal organ median dose with 
TMI compared to TBI. Data from Table 2 show that one can escalate the 
prescribed dose with helical tomotherapy TMI by a factor of 1.8 before reaching a 
median lung dose comparable to standard  TBI. Since median lung dose from TBI 
correlates to risk of lung toxicity (4) and since 2000 cGy is only 1.67 times higher than 1200 cGy, the risks of pulmonary toxicity should not be greater than standard TBI. Mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity and esophagus  are reduced by a factor of 
3.2 to 5.4, which should result in reduced mucositis and esophagitis  with the 
doses proposed compared to standard TBI. Median liver doses are reduced 3.3 
fold ma 
king the likelihood of hepatotoxicity less compared to TBI. Of note, in a 
review of radiation tolerance of the liver by Dawson et al. (5), the risk of radiation 
related hepatotoxicity was zero if mean liver doses were below 31Gy. In addition, 
if the volume of liver irradiated was < 1/3, the  risk of hepatotoxicity for doses up 
to 90 Gy was estimated at 5%.

Finally the graph below shows dose volum e histograms (DVH plots) for lung for 
3 scenarios: TBI to 1200 cGy (with 50% lung shielding and electron chest wall 
boost), TMI to 1200 cGy, and TMI to 2000 cGy. The DVH lung plots for TMI 1200 are to the left of the DVH plots for TBI 1200, indicating a substantially 
lower dose to the lungs for TMI. When the TMI dose is escalated to 2000, the 
DVH plots shift right but still remain to th e left of the TBI 120 0 plots, indicating 
that almost the entire lung volume will receive a lower dose with TMI 2000 than TBI.      
 
 
 
The use of dose volume histograms is an established method of predicting lung 
toxicity for a given dose to lung, with m
ultiple studies demonstrating minimal 
risks of radiation pneumonitis if 20-30% of  the lung volume irradiated is kept at 
doses below 20-25 Gy (6).  Of note, most multi-institutional clinical lung cancer protocols now use these DVH limits as part of the protocol requirements (RTOG, SWOG, etc.). As shown in the gra ph above, for a patient receiving 2000 cGy 
TMI, the V20 (20 % of lung volume) r eceives approximately 8 Gy, well below 
the 20-25 Gy limit required by these protocols.   Therefore, given all of the above, the planned highest dose level to marrow of 
2000 cGy TMI is felt to be appropriately
 conservative and should not result in 
toxicities that exceed TBI, but rather will likely result in reduced toxicities at least 
up to 2000 cGy.

In the proposed study we plan to delive r a TMI dose level of 1000 cGy, a starting 
dose below the traditional fractionated total body irradiation dose of 1200 cGy, 
and slightly above the 800 cGy usuall y administered together with 140 m
g/m2 of 
melphalan.   The dose will then be escalated  in cohorts of 3-6 patients per Phase I 
trial design as shown in the table below. If two fractions are delivered on the same 
day there must be a minimum of 6 hours between fractions.

 2.5 Maintenance Therapy  
In bone marrow samples of patients with  active MM there is am
 ple evidence for 
the presence of active angiogenesis (30); expression of certain adhesion molecules 
is also increased on the surface of such plasma cells in comparison to those from patients with MGUS. In at least one st udy, diminished vascularity following high-
dose therapy and PBPC seemed to be asso ciated with better outcome (31). Alpha

 interferon, an agent with possible antiangi ogenetic and other activities, has been 
found to exhibit antitumor activity in the therap
y of multiple myeloma. Data from 
our institution and from Europe have de monstrated prolonged disease-free and 
overall survival with maintenance in terferon therapy, but compliance, and 
feasibility of delivering set doses at regular frequency and for the planned 
duration is questionable (32, 33).  Maintenance therapy with steroids has also been found to be effective following sta ndard chemotherapy. (34) Thalidomide, 
an agent with possible antiangiogenesis potential, had been reported to induce 
tumor response-including short-lasting co mplete remissions- in heavily treated, 
relapsed patients with MM (35, 36). Hen ce, thalidomide, an agent effective in 
both salvage and first line therapeutic sett ings is a potentially promising tool in 
attempting further consolidation of the response/survival gains achieved following 
high-dose therapy and PBPC. More recen tly, Lenolidomide, which is approved 
for second line therapy of multiple myel oma, has shown great promise as a 
maintenance therapy. 
 2.6 Pamidronate or zoledronic acid in the therapy of multiple myeloma.  
Bisphosphonates– presumably by interfer ing with osteoclast-mediated bone 
resorption- are useful in
 reducing the incidence/complications of lytic metastases.  
Both pamidronate and zoledronic acid had been found effective in reducing the number skeletal complications, and may al so alter the natural history of MM by a 
direct effect on the myeloma cells. (37, 38)  In a study evaluating the role of 
zoledronic acid to prevent osteoporosis, less frequent yearly or every 3 months, 
and monthly administration were found to be equally effective (39). 
 2.7 Chromosomal abnormalities as prognostic indicators in MM 
  Cytogenetic abnormalities can be detected in significant numbers of MM cases;  the presence of 11q, -13 and deletion 13q have been associated with worse  survival
 (4); frequent abnormalities observed in MM include t(4;14) (p16;q32), 
 t(11;14) (q13;q32), t(8;14) (q24;32),  t(14;18) 9 q32;q21), 13q14 (Rb loss) and 
 others.(40) One of these translocations, t(4;14) may lead to dysregulations of two 
 separate oncogenes providing one of  many potential targets for specific 
 interventions in the future (40, 41).   Autologous stem cell transplantation fo llowing high-dose chemo-/radiotherapy 
 m
ay contribute to the development of  clonal hematopoietic evolution (or 
 unmask/accelerate previously existing clonal abnormalities).  Hence, we will 
 apply a unique assay (specific only in fema le patients) to detect the presence of 
 clonal hematopoiesis prior to high-dose th erapy as well as to monitor for the 
 development of such clones following treatment, in female participants.   2.8 COHNMC experience with tandem cycle high-dose therapy in MM 
 
Between 5/94 and 3/03, we treated 104 pa 
tients with stag es I-III multiple 
myelom
a on 2 sequentially developed tandem cycle high-dose chemotherapy

 trials.  Treatment consisted of cycle 1 of melphalan 150 mg/m2, and cycle 2 of 
oral busulfan 16 mg/kg x 4 days and cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg x 2 days (46 
patients) followed by G-CSF primed PBPC on the first trial, and the same combination but using IV busulfan 0.8 mg/kg x 4 days and cyclophosphamide (1.5 gm/m
2) and G-CSF primed PBPC support (58 patients), on the second trial.  
Patients with ≤ 10% bone marrow involvement in response, or with stable disease, 
and 2 prior treatment regimens, (fir st trial) and s ubsequently with ≤ 40% marrow 
involvement and inclusive of patients even  with plasma cell leukemia, and up to 3 
prior treatment regimens (second trial) were eligible.  All patients were to receive 
maintenance therapy with intereferon - α 2, starting at 3 million units/m2, given 
subcutaneously, three-times/ week.  Patie nts enrolled on the second trial were to 
receive thalidomide up to 400 mg/day in addi tion to interferon, if  they were not in 
complete remission by 6 months from initiating high-dose therapy.  The median age was 52-years, (range, 38-65), 2/3
rd of patients were diagnosed with stage III 
myeloma, and 40% received prior radiation therapy.  Th e median number of prior 
treatment regimens was 1 (1-3).  Me dian time from diagnosis to high-dose 
therapy was 8 months (range, 2-74).  Eighty nine percent of patients received both 
cycles at a median interv al of 75 days (29-134).  Among the 46 patients treated 
with oral busulfan there were 7 cases of venous-occlusive disease (VOD) with 3 
fatalities (Treatment-related mortality [T RM]: 7%).  Among 58 patients treated 
with IV busulfan, there were 6 cases of non-fatal VOD and one septic death 
(TRM: 1.7%).  Fifty-five percent of  the 104 patient cohort achieved ≥ 90% 
response (complete response rate: 39%; ve ry good partial res ponse: 16%).  While 
92 % of patients tolerated at least 1 million unit/m2 of interferon 2-3 times/week, 
only 8 patients were able to  tolerate concomitant admi nistration of interferon and 
up to 200 mg of thalidomide beyond 3 m onths, with 2 patient s converting into 
complete responders.   
 
   Three-year progression-free survival  is 48.5% (95% CI, 38-59%) and overall 
survival is 74.4% (95%CI, 65-83%) for the entire group.  Progression-free 
survival and overall survival are 67% and 93.9% for the first and 38% and 64.5% for the second cohort of patients.  Possible explanations for the somewhat worse 
outcom
e for the second cohort are the incl usion of less responsive patients ( ≤ 40% 
vs. ≤ 10% bone marrow involvement), inclus ion of patients with plasma cell 
leukemia, and up to 3 vs. 2 prior treatment regimens (33, 21). 
 
 2.9 Rationale for novel tandem high-dose chemotherapy and TMI followed by PBPC 
and lenalidomide/bisphosphonate ma
intenance. 
 
Based on the feasibility and possibly bette r complete response / very good partial 
response rate and progression-free surviv al of tandem
 cycles of melphalan and 
busulfan/cyclophosphamide followed by alpha  interferon +/- thalidomide, and 
based on the positive data supporting tandem therapy in a randomized, 
prospective trial and in view of the enc ouraging, survival data in this relatively 
“low tumor bulk” population with responding, or stable multiple myeloma we propose to treat a larger cohort of patients with exposure to <
 2 prior treatment 
regimens with tandem high-dose therapy.  
 
  Patients will be eligible with up to < 10% marrow involvement provided that they 
are either responding to induction th erapy or have stable disease. 
   We will continue to incorporate cycl ophosphamide both as a prim
 ing agent and to 
provide in vivo  purging prior to Filgrastim priming.  
   In view of the known therapeutic e fficacy of radiation to my
 elomatous bone 
involvement, and with the availability of  a likely safer method to deliver total 
marrow irradiation (TMI) with the potential  to escalate the total dose, we propose 
to replace busulfan and cyclophosphamid e as the conditioning regimen for cycle 
2.   Since the concomitant administration of conventionally delivered fractionated 
total body/marrow radiation has not been  more effective than, and possibly 
compromised delivery of full dose melphala n, total marrow irradiation as a single 
therapeutic modality during cycle 2 will be  tested in a phase I-II setting, followed 
by PBPC rescue. 
   While the recently published data comparing tandem cycle melphalan/fractionated 
total body irradiation followed by melphalan seem 
ed to yield better outcome in 
terms of progression-free and overall surv ival, with 80% of patients projected to 
progress by 7 years after tandem therapy, further improvements are badly needed. 
   Based on recent data presented at the American Society of Hem
 atology meetings 
in 2009 describing the potential benefit of Lenalidomide maintenance following 
an autologous stem cell transplant procedure from multiple groups but most specifically from the US Inter-group (Mc/ carthy P, et.al. Phase III Inter-group 
study of Lenalidomide versus placebo maintenance therapy following single autologous stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma [CALGB 100104]: Initial report of patient accrual and adverse even ts. Blood ASH annual meeting abstracts, 
Nov 2009; 114:3416:)  3/24/10 
   In addition, bisphosphonates will be a llowed to continue, or  will be recommended 
to be adm 
inistered, for a period of 2 y ears.  However, to avoid any potential 
adverse interactions between  bisphosphonates and thalidom ide, and in view of the 
lasting presence of bisphosphonates in th e bone, pamidronate or zoledronate will 
be administered at a frequenc y of every 3 months (39, 43). 
   Cytogenetic abnormalities by standard and FISH analysis to assess their role as 
predictors of response, monitors of residual disease and predictors of survival will be assessed. 
  Patients’ myeloma cells wi ll be banked frozen/c ell lines will be 
developed for future investigations of  tumor biology, drug testing, and for the 
potential to assess efficacy of novel therapeutic agents. 
 
3.0 THERAPEUTIC AGENTS   
 
3.1. Cyclophosphamide  
 
RB #04064     15     10-6-11 
Version: 12 
 
3.1.1 Mechanisms of Action: This drug is bi otransformed principally in the liver 
to active alkylating metabolites wh ich prevent cell division by cross 
linking strands of DNA and it al so inhibits DNA synthesis. 
 
3.1.2 Human Toxicity:  Toxicity from cyclophosphamide includes bone marrow 
suppression which usually occurs ten to  twelve days after administration, 
nausea and vom
iting, reversible alopecia, hemorrhagic cystitis which can 
frequently be prevented with increas ed hydration and co-administration of 
MESNA, and sterility and decreased gonadal function.  There are isolated 
reports of hemorrhagic colitis, or al mucosal ulceration, and jaundice. 
 
3.1.3 Pharmaceutical Data:  Formulation;  Cyclophosphamide is supplied in 10 0 
mg, 200 mg, and 500 mg vials as a white powder.  The drug can re 
reconstituted in either normal saline or D5W. 
 
   3.1.4 Administration:  The drug shoul d be dissolved in about 500 cc of 
D5W and it is infused IV over 2 hours.   An added dose of IV fluids ma
y 
help prevent bladder toxici ty.  Cyclophosphamide 1.5 gm/m2 (based on 
actual body weight) will be administered for mobilization, prior to apheresis.  There will be no correc tion for extremely obese patients.   
8/8/07 7/17/08
 
3.1.4 Supplier:  This drug is commercially available for purchase by the third 
party. 
 
3.2 Melphalan  (L-phenylalanine mustard, L-PAM, Alkeran) 
 
3.2.1 Mode of Action:  In common with other nitrogen mustards, melphalan 
reacts with DNA to produce either  DNA-DNA or DNA-proteins cross-
linked products probably by binding at the N-7 position of guanine. 
   3.2.2 
Supply, Reconstitution and Administ ration:  M elphalan is commercially 
available by Burroughs Wellcome Compa ny in sterile vials containing 50 
mg lyophilized drug as the hydrochloride sa lt.  It is formulated with 20 mg 
povidone per 50 mg vial.  Sterile diluen t is supplied which contains per 10 
ml: sodium citrate 0.20 g, propylene glycol 6 ml, ethanol (95%) 0.526 ml, sterile water q.s. 10 ml. Reconstituted vi als (undiluted soluti ons) are stable 
for 90 minutes.  Melphalan diluted in  NS to 0.1-0.45mg/ml is stable for 
only 60 minutes.  Melphalan is unstable when diluted with NS to 2mg/ml.  
The rate of infusion should be 30 minutes or less. 
 
3.2.3 Toxicity:  The dose-limiting toxicity of melphalan is myelosuppression.  
Other toxic 
ities after IV melphalan include mucositis, nausea, vomiting, 
and diarrhea.  Alopecia is generally seen only with high doses associated with bone marrow transplant settings.  Rarely reported reactions include 
pulmonary fibrosis, skin rash, vasculitis, and allergic reactions.  With high dose chemotherapy, gastrointestinal toxicity becomes dose limiting. At such high doses, elevated transami nases, syndrome of inappropriate

Version: 12 
 antidiuretic hormone secretion, depre ssion, interstitial pneu monitis, and 
hepatic veno-occlusive disease have  been reported. Acute nonlymphocytic 
leukemia and myeloproliferative s yndromes may occur as secondary 
cancers from any alkylating agent such as melphalan. Amenorrhea, 
permanent in many cases, have been noted when melphalan was used in premenopausal women undergoing adjuvant therapy for breast cancer.  Azoospermia would be expected, but  is not well documented in the 
literature. 
 
3.3 Filgrastim
 (r-metHuG-CSF) 
 
3.3.1 Description
 
Filgrastim is a human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), produced by recombinant DNA technology.  NEUPOGEN® is the Am
gen 
Inc. trademark for Filgrastim, recombinant methionyl human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (r-metHuG-CSF).  
 
Approximately 6,400 patients in U.S. a nd international based trials have 
participated
 in clinical trials of Filgrastim to date, and the worldwide 
commercial populations receiving Filgrastim totaled approximately 190,000.  The drug has been found to be we ll tolerated at dosages up to 60 
µg/kg/day given IV or SC, with no toxi c effects attributable to Filgrastim. 
A maximum tolerated dose has not yet been determined. 
 
3.3.2 Contraindications
 
NEUPOGEN® is contraindi cated in patients with known hypersensitivity 
to E. coli-derived proteins, Filgrastim, or any component of the product. 
 
3.3.3 Adverse Reactions  
 
 The only consistently observed c linical  toxicity described with 
Neupogen® is medullary bone pain. Other clinical toxicities that have been described include skin rash, and cutaneous vasculitis.  Since commercial introduction of Neupogen®, th ere have been rare reports of 
allergic-type reactions.  Biochemical abnormalities that may occur include 
increases in alkaline phosphatase, uric acid, and lactate deydrogenase. 
 
3.3.4 Dilution and Storage
 
 
 If required, NEUPOGEN® may be diluted in 5% dextrose.  
NEUPOGEN® diluted to concentrat ions between 5 and 15 m

• Musculoskeletal: arthralg ia, back
/neck pain, joint pain, muscle cramp and 
weakness. 
• Cardiac: hypotension. 
• Derm
atologic: rash, dry skin, itching. 
• Endocrine: hypothyroidism. 
• Infection. 
• Pulmonary: cough, dyspnea. 
• Metabolic: hypokalemia, liver dam age. 
• Renal: increased cr eatinine, renal failure. 
 
3.5 Pregnancy reporting: 
 
Pregnancies occurring while the subject is on lenalidom ide or within four weeks  
after the subject’s last dose of lenalidom ide are considered expedited reportable

 events.  If the subject is on lenalidomide, it is to be discontinued imm ediately and 
the subject is to be instructed to retu rn any unused portion of lenalidomide to the 
Investigator.  The pregnancy must be reported with in 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s knowledge of the pregna ncy by phone and facsimile using the SAE 
Form.  
 
The Investigator will follow the subjec t until completion of the pregnancy , and 
must report the outcome as specified belo w.  The Investigator will provide this 
information as a follow-up to the initial SAE. 
 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets th e criteria for immediat e clas sification as 
a SAE (i.e., spontaneous abortion [any conge nital anomaly detected in an aborted 
fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the 
Investigator should follow the procedures report the event wi thin 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s knowledge of the event). 
 Any suspected fetal exposure to lenalidom ide must be reported within 24 hours of 
being m
ade aware of the event.  The patient should be referred to an 
obstetrician/gynecologist e xperienced in reproductiv e toxicity for further 
evaluation and counseling.  All neonatal deaths that occu r within 30 days of birth should be reported, without 
regard to causality, as S
AEs.  In additi on, any infant death after 30 days that the 
Investigator suspects is related to the in utero  exposure to lenalidomide should 
also be reported. 
 
In the case of a live “normal” birth, the outcome should be reported as soon as the 
inf
ormation is available.   
 
Other instructions related to lenalidomide: 
Only one cycle of therapy may be dispen sed to the patient each month.  During 
ma
intenance a max of a 28-day supply may be dispensed.  Lenalidomide capsules 
should be swallowed whole, and should not be broken, chewed or opened.  If a 
dose of lenalidomide is missed, it should be  taken as soon as possible on the same 
day.  If it is missed for the entire day, it should not be made up.  Patients taking 
more than the prescribed dose of lena lidomide should be instructed to seek 
emergency medical care if needed and contact study staff immediately.  See Appendices D (Risks of Fetal Exposure,  Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and 
Acceptable Birth Control Methods) and E (Education and Counseling Guidance 
Document).    
3.6 Total Marrow Irradiation (TMI) 
 
3.6.1 Administration: Ionizing radiation is an established and effective method 
RB #04064     20     10-6-11 
Version: 12 
 in treating multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is in general a 
radiosensitive dise
ase. Total marrow irradiation will be delivered using a 
Helical Tomotherapy HiArt System (Tomotherapy, Inc). The administration schedule and dose escala tion scheme are described below. 
 
3.6.2. Acute toxicities:  Toxi
 cities fr om TMI may incl ude bone marrow 
suppression, alopecia, fatigue, and skin erythema. Other acute toxicities, which occur with traditional total body irradiation and may also occur 
with TMI (but anticipated to be of lower frequency and/or less severity) 
include mucositis, esophagitis, enteritis, cystitis, proctitis, pneumonitis, 
nausea and vomiting and sterility.  
 
3.6.3. Potential Late Toxicities: Due to c onfor
 mal avoidance of dose to normal 
organs, late toxicities from TMI are anticipated to be less frequent and/or 
severe compared with total body irradi ation. Potential late  toxicities may 
include sterility, endocrinopathies (i.e. hypothyroidism), cataract formation, pneumonitis, veno-occlusive disease, and second malignancy induction.  
  3.7. Pamidronate
 
 
3.7.1. Mechanism of Action:  Pam idronate is an inhibitor of bone resorption and, 
in addition may interfere with the release, deposition of metastatic tumor deposits. 
 
3.7.2. Toxicity:  Fatigue, fever, diarrhea,  nausea, arthralgias, and rarely 
hypocalcem 
ia, phlebitis at the site of injection have been observed. 
 
3.7.3. Pharmaceutical Data:  Pami dronate is  supplied in 30, 60, and 90 mg vials 
as a freeze-dried powder.  Reconstitu tion can be done in 10 mL of sterile 
water, than the appropriate volume of  pamidronate will be missed with 
normal (0.9%) saline to a total volu me of 250 mL.  Pamidronate will be 
infused over 2 hours.  If the reconstitu ted solution is not used immediately, 
it can be stored at temperatures between 36-46 °F and can be used for up 
to 24 hours. 
 
3.7.4. Pamidronate is commercially available. 
 
3.8. Zoledronic Acid  
 
3.8.1. Mechanism of Action:  Zoledronic acid is an inhibito r of bone resorption 
and, in addition may interfere with th e release, deposition of metastatic 
tumor deposits. 
 
3.8.2. Toxicity:  Fatigue, fever, diarrhea,  nausea, arthralgias, and rarely 
hypocalcaem
ia, phlebitis at the site of injection have been observed.

 Other Non-Hematologic Toxicity  
• For other grade 3 non-h
 ematologic toxicity, hold CC-5013 until toxicity 
resolves to < grade 2, then the study drug shoul d be resumed at the next 
lower close level. 
• For patients who develop grade < non-hematologic toxicity, an attempt 
will be made to maintain the patient at  that dose level. If the patient cannot 
tolerate this dose level, the treating physician should decrease the dose to 
the next lower dose level. 
• For other grade 4 non-hematologic t oxicity, discontinue study drug and 
contact the Study Chair or Co-Chair. 
  
In the event of any grade 1 or 2 
toxicity that the patient finds 
intolerable, the study drug ma
y be held until th e toxicity resolves and the 
study drug resumed at the next lower dose level. Alternatively, the study drug may be continued at the next lower dose level without cessation of study drug. However, study drug should be held for the occurrence of a resh consistent with evolving Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic 
epidermal necrolysis (bull ous, blistering that is pu rpuric in nature) until 
appropriate evaluation is made. Study drug may be held for up to 8 weeks. Contact the Study Chair or Co-Chair for consultation. 
Venous Thrombosis 
 
Patients who develop signs of sympto ms suggestive of thrombosis should 
be evaluated and treated as clinica lly indicated. CC
-5013 should be held 
for patients with venous thrombosis CC-5013 may resume when patient is adequately anticoagulated. Patients with recurrent thrombosis despite adequate anticoagulation should ge  removed from protocol therapy. 
 
Renal Toxicity 
 
• For creatinine clearance (CrCI) < 30  mL
 /min skip Lenalidomide and 
reassess in four weeks. If CrCI remains < 30 Ml/min after four weeks, 
then discontinue Lenalidomide. 
• For CRCI < 60 mL/ min but > 30 mL/min: 
o If on 3 capsules per day, decrease Lenalidomide to 1 capsule 
alternating with 2 capsu
les daily  (1 capsule on day, followed by 2 
capsules the next day…etc.). R eassess after four weeks and 
attempt to re-escalate Lenalidomide. 
o If on 2 capsules per day, decrease Lenalidomide to 1 capsule per 
day. Reassess after four weeks and attem
pt to re-escalate 
Lenalidomide. 
o If on 1 capsule per day, decrease Lenalidomide to 1 capsule per 
day for 21 of 28 days. Reassess after four weeks and attempt to re-
escalate Len
alidomide. 
    
6.5.4 Pamidronate or zoledronic acid 
 
There will be no dose adjustments.  Pamidronate or zoled ronate can be 
premedicated with a non-steroidal an ti-inflammatory agent, or with 
acetaminophen, if fever or constitu tional symptoms occur following 
administration.  
7.0 EVALUATION AND TOXICITIES  
 Physical evaluation, laboratory a nd radiographic evaluation will be perform
 ed as outlined below.  
When evaluating toxicity CTCA E version 3 will be used. 
 
7.1. Patients will be examined and graded by the treating physician for subjective and                          
objective ev
idence of toxicities accordi ng to the Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE), which can be found at:  
<http://ctep.cancer.gov/r eporting/ctc.html>  daily during both the first and second 
treatment cycle through recovery, monthly fo r the first year and then yearly for 
the first three years.   
 
7.2 Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT): 
 Dose Limiting Toxicity
 (DLT) will be based on toxicities observed following the 
second cycle: TMI followed by PBPC   Toxicity grading will be ba sed on the NCI CTCAE version 3.0
 which can be 
found at http://ctep.cancer.gov/ reporting/ctc.html . 
 To be fully treated and fully followed fo r toxicity, a patient must receive both 
cycles of the tandem transplant (cycle 1: m 
elphalan, followed by cycle 2: TMI) at 
the planned doses and be observed for at le ast 4 weeks after the start TMI, or have 
experienced DLT following the second cycl e.  All patients who are not fully 
treated and fully followed for toxicity wi ll be replaced before dose escalation is 
permitted. 
 
Toxicity will be graded according to th e NCI common toxicity criteria (CTCAE 
v3.0).  Dose limiting tox
icity (DLT) in a given patient is defined as: 
 7.2.1 Any Grade 3, non-hematologic unexpected  toxicity (not reversible to 
2/14/06

 grade 2 or less within on e week from the onset). 
 
7.2.2 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia,  if it lasts beyond 28 days 
 
7.2.3 Grade 4 neutropenia associated with fever or infection and lasting beyond 
three weeks, or grade 4 neutropeni a lasting for more than 28 days. 
  7.2.4 
The following will not be considered DLT:  
    
 7.2.4.1 > Grade 3 nausea or > Grade 3 vomiting that occurs following 
non-compliance with protocol prescribed antiemetic therapy 
 
 7.2.4.2 > Grade 3 diarrhea that occurs  following non-compliance with 
protocol prescribed therapy 
  7.1.5.3 any Grade 3 fatigue 
 
7.3 Dose Escalation Rules:  
A Phase I Tr
acking log will be completed and kept by the Clinical Research 
Associate (CRA) and the Statistician fr om the Department of Biostatistics. 
 Rules for dose escalation and expansion in  cohorts of patients are based on DLT 
occurring following each patient’s second transplant in the tandem. Patients who 
drop out prior to the second cycle will be considered inevaluable. Three patients 
will be trea
ted at each new dose level.  If 0/3 patients experience DLT attributable 
to the study treatment, 3 patients will be tr eated at the next dose level.  If DLT 
attributable to the treatment  (i.e. definitely, probably, or possibly attributed) is 
experienced in exactly 1/3 of patients, 3 mo re patients (for a total of 6) will be 
treated at that dose level.  If no additional DLT, attributable to the treatment, is observed at the expanded dose level (i.e. 1/6 with DLT), the dose will be escalated.  Escalation will terminate as soon as two or more patients experience 
any DLT attributable to the study treatmen t, at a given dose level or a treatment 
related death is observed following the 2
nd cycle.  The Phase I trial will be closed 
when 6 patients have been treated at the next lower dose level, and at most 1/6 
patients experience DLT.  If more than 1/6 patients experience DLT, the next 
lower dose will be expanded. 
 
Once the MTD has been determined, additional accrual at the MTD will commence, beginning the phase II porti on of the study (the initial 6 patients 
treated at the MTD during the dose escal ation will b
e counted in the phase II 
portion).

9.0 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS 
 
The following definitions will be used for th is study.  Response can be defined as a 50% 
or better reduction in serum myeloma prot ein production and further categorized as 
com
pleted and partial.   
 
9.1 Response Gradations : 
 
9.1.1 Complete response : Defined as the absence of bone marrow or blood 
findings of multiple myeloma on at least 2 measurements at a minimum of a 6 week interval.  Thus all eviden ce of serum and urinary M-components 
must disappear on electrophoresis as we ll as by immunofi xation studies.  
The follow-up bone marrow may not contain more than 5% plasma cells on aspiration or core biopsy and no evidence of increasing anemia.  
Skeletal X-rays must either show recal cification or no change in osteolytic 
lesions. Resolution of soft tissue plasmocytomas. 
 
9.1.2 Partial Response
:  Sustained decrease of th e monoclonal serum protein by 
> 50% reduction) on at leas t two measurements of at least 6 week interval.  
A response is clear-cut for patients who achieve a 75% or greater reduction in the serum myeloma protein concentration without evidence of 
increasing anemia.  Responding patient s must also have a sustained 
decrease in 24-hour urine M-component  to less of the initial prestudy 
value, and to less than 0.2 gm/day on at least two measurements at three-
week intervals.  For a response to be confirmed, a marked reduction in 
both serum myeloma protein and in Benc e-Jones protein excretion must be 
present.  Bone marrow plasma cells  should be reduced by at least 50% 
from the pretreatment level, and soft tissue plasmo cytomas should be 
reduced by ≥ 50%. 
 
RB #04064     38     10-6-11 
Version: 12 
 Very Good Partial Response :  Defined as reduction  of bone marrow or 
blood findings of multiple myeloma on at least 2 measurements at a 
minimum of a 6 week interval By ≥  90%  
 
9.1.3 In all complete, and responding patie nts, the size and number of lytic 
skeletal lesions must not increase,
 and the serum calcium must remain 
normal.  Any of the following ancillar y data will support the conclusion 
that an objective response has occurred, but are not required to confirm 
response:  1) recalcification of lytic s kull or pelvis lesions (occurs in about 
20% of responding patients with lytic lesions); 2) significant increase in 
depressed normal immunoglobulins, as in lgM increments exceeding 20 mg%, lgA exceeding 40 mg%, and lgG exceeding 400 mg% (occurs in about 15% of responding patients); 3) fall in the level of the serum beta-2 microglobulin to the normal ra nge (less than 1.0 mg/dl). 
   
9.2 Minor response
:  Patients with 25 - 49% tumor mass regression without new 
symptoms or signs of myeloma with declines in the serum myeloma protein production of 25% to 49% , or 50-89% reduction in 24 hour urinary light chain excretion, which still exceeds 200 mg/24 hours, and maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks. 
 
9.3 Stable disease
:  Is defined as a lack of progression (change of < 25% myeloma 
protein) for a minimum duration of 3 months. 
 9.4 Progression
:  Any of the following: patients wi th a > 25% increase in myeloma 
protein production and confir med at least once on repeated examination within 2-
4 weeks, or other signs of disease such as hypercalcemia > 11.5 mg/dL, or new bone/plasmocytoma lesions.  >25% increas e in bone marrow biopsy of  plasma 
cells, with a minimum of 10% involvement.    
 9.5 Relapse
:  This is defined by the unequivocal objective evidence and constitutes 
the earliest of any of the following:  1) an increase by more than 100% from the 
lowest level of the serum myeloma protein production; 2) an increase above the 
response level of the myeloma peak (i.e., relapse to more than  25% of the baseline 
myeloma protein production); 3) reapp earance of the myeloma peaks that had 
disappeared with the treatment; 4) definite increase in the size and number of lytic 
bone lesions recognized on radiographs ; 5) Newly developed soft tissue 
plasmocytoma; 6)  >25% increase in bone marrow biopsy of plasma cells, with a minimum of 10% involvement.  Compressi on fractures per se do not constitute a 
relapse.   
 9.6 Performance Status
:  Karnofsky Performance status will be recorded. 
 
10.0 REPORTING DATA 
 
All primary data will be maintained by the Department of Biostatis tics, City of Hope 
National Medical Center. This includes on st udy flow sheets, consent forms and off-study 
forms. 
 
11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATI ONS 
 
11.1 STUDY DESIGN FOR THE PHASE I PA RT OF STUDY AND R ULES FOR 
DOSE ESCALATION  
 
 Rules for dose escalation, dose expansi on, and termination of escalation are given 
 below. 
  For each patien
t, the enrollment, course initiation, dose, and adverse event data  
 must be submitted on case report forms within two weeks of the end of the first  course, as these data will form the basis for dose escalation decisions.  No  additional patients may be en rolled at an escalated dose until all patients from the 
 current dose level have been fully followed, and their data co llection forms have 
 been received and the escalation has been approved by the PI and study  coordinator.  11.2 Dose Limiting Toxicity
 (DLT) will be based on toxicities obse rved following the 
 second cycle: TMI followed by PBPC  
 Toxicity grading will be based on the NCI CTCAE version 3.0.    To be fully treated and fully followed for toxicity, a patient must receive both cycles of the tandem transplant (cycle 1:me
lphalan, followed by cycle 2:TMI) at 
the planned doses and be observed for at le ast 4 weeks after the start TMI, or have 
experienced DLT following the second cycl e.  All patients who are not fully 
treated and fully followed for toxicity wi ll be replaced before dose escalation is 
permitted. 
 
Toxicity will be graded according to th e NCI common toxicity criteria (CTCAE 
v3.0).   Dose limiting to
xicity (DLT) in a given patient is defined as: 
 11.2.1 Any Grade 3, non-hematologic unexpected  toxicity (not reversible to 
grade 2 or less within on e week from the onset). 7/12/06
 
11.2.2 Any Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity 
 
11.2.3
 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, if it lasts beyond 28 days 
 
11.2.4 Grade 4 neutropen ia associated with fever or infection and lasting beyond 
three weeks, or grade 4 neutropeni a lasting for more than 28 days. 
 
11.2.5 The following will not be considered DLT:   
 
RB #04064     39     10-6-11 
Version: 12 
 
11.2.5.1  > Grade 3 nausea or > Grade 3 vomiting that occurs   
 following non-compliance with protocol prescribed   
 antiemetic therapy  11.2.5.2 >
 Grade 3 diarrhea that occurs following non-compliance 
 with protocol prescribed therapy  11.2.5.3 any Grade 3 fatigue 
 
 11.3 Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)
 
 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is de fined as the highest dose tested in 
which there is no treatment related m
ortality and none or only one patient 
experienced DLT attributable to the study dr ug(s), when at least six patients were 
fully treated at that dose and fully followed for toxicity.  The MTD is one dose level below the lowest dose tested in which 2 or more patients experienced DLT attributable to the treatment or there was a treatment related death.  At least 6 patients will be treated at the MTD.   
 
 11.4 Dose Escalation Schedule
 
 
The dose of melphalan is fixed.   The dos e of the helical  radiation will follow the 
dose escalation according to the schedule given below.

If at any time during the dose escalation part of this study, a treatment related 
mortality is observed, that dose level will be closed and the dose below will either 
be declared the MTD or further patients will be accrued at that lower dose level if less than 6 evaluable patients have  been accrued to that level. 
 
 11.5 Numbers of Patients and Rules for Dose Escalation
 
  Rules for dose escalation and expansion in cohorts of patients are based on DLT

  occurring following each patient’s second transplant in the tandem. Patients who 
 
drop out prior to the second cycle will be considered inevaluable. Three patients 
 will be treated at each new dose level.  If 0/3 patients experience DLT attributable 
 to the study treatment, 3 patients will be treated at the next dose level.  If DLT  attributable to the treatment (i.e. defi nitely, probably, or po ssibly attributed) is 
 experienced in exactly 1/3 of patients, 3 more patients (for a total of 6) will be 
 treated at that dose level.  If no additional DLT, attributable to the treatment, is  observed at the expanded dose level (i.e. 1/6 with DLT), the dose will be  escalated.  Escalation will te rminate as soon as two or more patients experience 
 any DLT attributable to the study treatmen t, at a given dose level or a treatment 
 related death is obs erved following the 2
nd cycle.  The Phase I trial will be closed 
 when 6 patients have been treated at th e next lower dose level, and at most 1/6 
 patients experience DLT.  If more than 1/6 patients experience DLT, the next 
 lower dose will be expanded.   Once the MTD has been determined, additional accru
 al at the MTD will 
 commence, beginning the phase II porti on of the study (the initial 6 patients 
 treated at the MTD during the dose escalation will be counted in the phase II  portion).   
    
 11.6 This is a Phase I/II study of tandem high-dose therapy cons isting of melphalan 
(cycle 1) an 
d then TMI (cycle 2) for patients with multiple myeloma.   During the 
dose escalation, the melphalan dose will be held constant, and the radiation dose 
will be escalated to find the maximum tolerated dose, which will also be deemed the recommended dose.   
  11.7 This study is expected to accrue a mi
 nimum of 31 evaluable patients, with an 
expected accrual of 53-75 patients. Th e study should be completed by early 2013 
the latest with a projected minimum y early accrual of 6 patients per year.  
 
11.8 Analysis of Clinical Endpoints of  Phase I portion : The design of the Phase I 
 portion of the trial is described above, together with the definition DLT, and 
 MTD. 
 
  The toxicities observed at each dose level will be summarized in terms of type 
(organ affected or laboratory determ
ination such as absolute neutrophil count), 
severity (by NCI Common Toxicity Crite ria (version 3) and nadir or maximum 
values for the laboratory measures), time of onset (i.e. course number), duration, 
and reversibility or outcome.  Tables will be created to summarize these toxicities 
and side effects by dose and by course.  Ba seline information (e.g. the extent of 
prior therapy) and demographic information will be presented, as well, to describe 
the patients treated in  this study.  All responses will  be reported.  Survival and 
time to failure will be summarized both by pooling across dose levels and by dose level, although the primary outcome of the phase II portion will include only the patients accrued at the MTD. 
 
11.9 Study design and sample-size for Phase II portion of study:
  
RB #04064     42     10-6-11 
Version: 12 
  
11.9.1 Sample-size for Phase II portion : For the purpose of this analysis the rate 
response is defined as sum of a near CR (Very Good Partial Response) or 
a CR as described in the response crite ria. To estimate th e response rate a 
two stage minimax design suggested by Simon will be used [ref 2].  It is 
assumed that a true response rate less  than 50% would not warrant further 
study of this regimen.  It is also assumed that a response rate of 68% 
would be considered promising for furt her studies.  In the first stage, 28 
evaluable patients will be entered.  If less than 14 res ponses are observed, 
the accrual will stop with the conclusi on that the regimen is not promising 
for further study.  If 15 or more responses are observed in the first 28 patients, an additional 22  patients will be accrued during the second stage 
of the phase II accrual. 30 or more responses out of 50  patients will be 
considered as evidence warranting furt her study of the regimen providing 
other factors, such as toxicity and survival, also appear fa vorable.  If less 
than 30 responses out of  50 patients are observed, further study of the 
regimen would not be warranted.  The probability of falsely declaring an agent with a 50% response probability as warranting further study is 0.1  
(alpha) and the probability of correctly declaring an agent with a 68% response probability as warranting further study is 90%  (power). As 
evaluation of response takes several m onths, it is likely that accrual will 
exceed the interim stopping point prior to  being able to evaluate the first 
28 patients. If that is the case, cu rtailed sampling will be employed two 
months after the first 28 patients ha ve been treated to estimate the 
probability of passing the required thres hold. If the probability of failing to 
meet the required threshold exceeds 50% under the promising response rate assumption, accrual will cease until additional follow-up is obtained on the 28 patients (up to 6 months may be required for a confirmation of a response). With 50 patients the true  probability of response can be 
estimated with a maximum standard error equal to 7%. 
 11.9.2 Accrual to the Phase II portion:
 Based on the current referral patterns to 
the City of Hope, it was expected th at approximately 20 patients per year 
will be eligible for this study. With a goal of 50 patients treated at the 
MTD. The protocol will need to remain open through 2013. As the majority of relapses are expected to occur within 3 years, and it will take 
approximately 1 year to find the MTD, this study will continue to allow for sufficient follow-up for the secondary goal of analyzing disease progression and survival. 
RB #04064     43     10-6-11 
Version: 12 
 11.9.3 Early Stopping Rules : 
 
Number of Patients Accrued at MTD Number of treatment-related deaths Permitted 
20 <2 
30 <3 
40 <3 
 
11.9.4 Specifically, if there are 2 treatment related deaths in the first 20 patients, 
the study will be stopped. If there are 3 tr eatment related deaths in the first 
40 patients, the study will be stopped.   Due to the follow-up tim
e, if there 
are two treatment related deaths in the first 20 patients, but the treatment related deaths occur when there ar e a total of 30 patients accrued, no 
further accrual will occur, until six months of follow-up are obtained on the 30 patients. If there are no furthe r treatment related deaths, accrual will 
recommence.  Additional safe guards/stopping rules include: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting beyond 28 days, Grade  4 neutropenia associated 
with fever or infection and lasting beyond 3 weeks, or  grade 4 neutropenia lasting beyond 28 days without fever in more than 2 of 20 patients, or more than 3 of 30 patients, or  more than 4 of 40 patients during the second phase  of the study.  
 11.9.5 This stoppin
 g rule provides a 41% proba bility of stopping at 20 patients if 
the true TRM rate is 7%, and provid es a greater than 50% chance of 
stopping prior to completion of accrual. If the true TRM rate is 1.5%, there 
is less than a 4% chance of stopping  at 20 patients, and less than a 10% 
chance of stopping prior to the completion of accrual. 
 
11.9.6 Survival Analysis: If our accrua l goa l is met with no premature 
termination due to significant toxicity  or lack of response, a secondary 
goal of assessing progression-free surv ival (PFS) and overall survival 
(OS) will be carried out. Survival  estimates will be made using the 
product-limit method of Kaplan and Me ier, with 95% confidence limits 
calculated using the logit transf ormation. These estimates will be 
contrasted with the historical rates at the City of Hope of 48.5% PFS and 
74.4% OS at three years, although formal hypothesis testing will not be 
conducted.  
 
12.0 GENDER AND ETHNICITY STATEMENT  
 
The City of Hope has a plan in place to increase minority recruitment to our studies in

13.0 ETHICAL AND REGULATO RY CONSIDERATIONS 
 
This study is to be approved by the Institutiona l Review Board of the City of Hope.  All 
patients will have signed an informe
d consent fo r participation in research activities, and 
will have been given a copy of the Expe rimental Subject's Bill of Rights. 
 
When results of this study are reported in medical journals or at meetings, identification of those taking part will be withheld.  Medica l records of 
 patients will be maintained in 
strictest confidence, according to current le gal requirements.  However, they will be

2/14/06 14.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING 
14.1  Definition of Risk Level 
  
This is a Risk Level 3 study, as defined in the “Guidance, Policy and Procedures for 
Data and Safety Monitoring for In
-House Trials at City of Hope”, 
http://www.infosci.coh.org/gcrc/doc/dsmp.doc  because it is a Phase I/II clinical trial 
where the risks are at least balanced by the potential benefit to subjects and the 
importance of the knowledge that may result. 
 
14.2 Monitoring and Personnel Responsible for Monitoring 
 
The Protocol Management Team (PMT) consisting of the PI, Collaborating Investigator, CRA, protocol nurse, and  statistician is respo 
nsible for monitoring the 
data and safety of this study, including implementation of stopping rules for safety.  
 
Reporting of data to the DSMB during the Phase I portion will occur at each decision 
to escalate a dose, and a Phase I tracki ng log will be subm
itted in addition to the 
toxicity summaries to the DSMB.  During the Phase II portion, reporting of data will 
occur at intervals separated by no more than six months, 10 patients or a treatment related death. This report (the PMT report) will include a summary of accrual, 
adverse events and treatment related mortality.

 Type of Adverse Event When Reported 
● UNEXPECTED  & SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
≥  GRADE 3 
that are possibly, probably or definitely related  to th e st udy 
procedures   Within 5 busin ess days 
(The report will be forwarded to the IRB co ncurrent  with 
th
e DSMB review.  The report and the DSMB review will 
also be forwarded to the CPRMC when the DSMB review is 
complete.) 
● UNEXPECTED  & SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT S  
> GRADE 4  
that are unrelated or unlikely related  to t he study procedures  Within 10 business days  
(The
 report and the DSMB review will be forwarded to the 
IRB and th e C
PRMC when the DSMB review is complete.)  
● EXPECTED  & SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
≥  GRADE 4 
Cancer Therapeutic  Tria ls without  dose escalation:  
thrombocytopenia and non-hematologic events ≥ Grade 4 
Cancer Therapeutic Trials with  dose escalation : neutropenia , 
thrombocytopenia and non-hematologic events  ≥ Grade 4 
Non-Cancer Studies:  All even ts ≥ Gra de 4 Within 10 business days  
(The
 report and the DSMB review will be forwarded to the 
IRB and th e C
PRMC when the DSMB review is complete.) 
 
14.3  Adverse Events 
 
14.3.1. Reporting:  Adverse events must be reported to the COH DSMB, IRB, and 
GCRC (if GCRC supported) according to  definitions and guidelines at 
http://www.infosci.coh.org/gcrc/doc/dsmp.doc  and 
http://resadmin.coh.org/doc/irb3810.doc , which are defined below.  SAEs 
will be monitored by the PMT. Less th an serious adverse events will be 
reported only at the time of protocol continuation reports. In the event that an 
SAE is categorized as an “unacceptable toxicity” or “treatment related 
mortality”, the tables in section 11 will be checked to verify that no toxicity 
based stopping condition has been met.    
 
14.3.2. Adverse Event - An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical experience 
or change of an existing condition that occurs durin g or after tre
atment, 
whether or not it is considered to be related to the protocol intervention. All AEs occurring during this study, whether observed by the physician, nurse, or reported by the patient, will be recorded on the City of Hope National 
Medical Center Adverse Events (COH AER) form 
(http://resadmin.coh.org/doc/irb3820.doc
).  
 
14.3.3 Serious Adverse Event- A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any 
expected or 
unexpected adverse event  (AE, generally equivalent to 
CTCAE grades 3, 4 or 5) that is related or unrelated  to the intervention 
that results in any of the following outcomes: 
 
• Death 
• A life-threatening event 
• In-patient hospitalization (not required  as part of th e treatment) or   
             prolongation of existing h ospitalizatio n 
RB #04064     46     10-6-11 
Version: 12 
 • A persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• A congenital anomaly / birth defect 
• Causes cance r 
• Is an overdose 
 
Certain m e
dical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require hospitalization, may
 also be considered a serious adverse event when 
appropriate medical or surgical intervention is necessary to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. 
 
14.3.4 Unexpected Adverse Event – Any event in which the severity or specificity is 
not consistent  with the risk inform
ation described in the protocol, and the 
event is not anticipated from the subject's disease history or status. 
 
14.3.5. Expected Adverse Event - Any event in which the severity or specificity is 
consistent wi th the risk inform ation described in th
e protocol or is anticipated 
based on the subject's medical history. 
 
14.3.6. Attribution - For reporting purposes, attribution is the assessment of the 
likelihood that an AE is ca used b
y the research agent or protocol intervention.  
The attribution is assigned by the Principal Investigator after considering the 
clinical information, the medical histor y of the subject, and past experience 
with the research agent/intervention.  This is recorded using the Adverse 
Event Report (COH AER) form ( http://resadmin.coh.org/doc/irb3820.doc ) in 
one of 5 categories scored as the following: 5=related, 4=probably related, 
3=possibly related, 2=unlikely related and 1=unrelated.  The attribution is 
subject to change as follow-up information becomes available, and it can be changed by the DSMB or by the IRB in the process of review.

Duration of treatment 46 weeks
Statistical methods The analysis for PoCC and dose-finding will be performed using 
multiple comparison and modelling techniques (MCPMod) whereby several possible dose response models (patterns) will be evaluated, while keeping full control of the type I error at 2.5% (one-sided) to identify the best-fitting model or subset of models. A plausible and diverse range of monotone dose response patterns will be used for this purpose, with placebo mean response assumed to be zero and the mean response at the highest BI 456906 dose assumed to be -10.0 (i.e. a percentage reduction from baseline in body weight of 10%).A mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis will first be carried out. The MMRM will include fixed effects for baseline body weight and baseline by visit interaction as continuous covariates, and treatment, gender, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction as factors. Unstructured covariance will be used to model the relationship between pairs of endpoint measurements taken at different visits on the same patient. Adjusted mean percentage change in body weight at Week 46 for each treatment group and the covariance matrix will be extracted from the MMRM fit and used for the subsequent MCPMod analysis. PoCC will be established if at least one model is statistically significant, rejecting the null hypothesis of a flat dose response relationship for percentage change in body weight jointly over the candidate dose response models, with a contrast test controlled for the family–wise type I error rate at one sided α = 2.5%. If PoCC is 
established, the statistically significant (best fitting) model(s) from the above candidate set will be refitted to the data to generate new estimates for all model parameters from the data. The target dose(s) will be estimated from the best fitting model(s) by incorporating information on the minimum clinically relevant effect and accounting for safety. The primary analysis of percentage change from baseline in body weight at Week 46 will be performed using the full analysis set (FAS), defined as all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study treatment and who have analysable data for at least 
one efficacy endpoint. Patients will be assigned to the randomised 
maintenance dose. The analysis will include all available data without regard to whether patients started the maintenance period with a lower dose than the one randomised to. For patients who discontinued treatment early, a distinction will be made according to whether this is due to a COVID-19 pandemic-related reason or not. Patients who discontinued treatment early due to a pandemic-related reason will have data handled after discontinuation as if they were missing (hypothetical strategy). Patients who discontinued treatment

Footnotes for Flow Charts:
1. Day of Randomisation 
2. Blood sample collection for biobanking is optional and requires a separate informed consent 3. Measurements of vital signs should preceed blood sampling and be assessed at all dosing visits according to 
section 5.2.2 . Vital signs include DBP/SBP measurement, pulse rate, respiration rate, and body temperature
4. Women of childbearing potential only. Xs =serum testing by central laboratory; Xu= onsite urine testing; Serum 
pregnancy testing is done at screening and as a reflex when urine testing is positive. Pregnancy testing at and after 
Visit 2 should be performed prior to administration of trial medication
5. Safety lab include haematology, clinical chemistry, infectious serology, lipids and urinalysis. For details refer to 
Table 5.2.3:1 . All blood samples should be collected before the administration of trial medication. 
6. PCR Test on SARS-CoV-2 to be performed at Visit 1
7. FASTING sample: on these days, blood samples will also include some efficacy parameters including fasting 
glucose, insulin and C-peptide, and fasting lipid battery These visits would preferably be scheduled on mornings
8. Centralized ECG. ECG should be recorded before blood samples are taken. ECG recording may be repeated by 
investigator for medical or quality reasons. ECG at follow up, only in case abnormal at previous visit. For ECG measurement, follow guidelines in Section 5.2.4 .
9. PK and ADA/NAb sampling at trough prior to administration of next dose. In case of systemic hypersensitivity, 
also draw a plasma sample for IgE and ADA as detailed in the Lab Manual (ISF). Also include the evaluation of 
histamine, serum tryptase, and complement components
10. Blood sample for exploratory biomarkers at Visit 2 should be collected before the administration of trial 
medication (pre-dose value)
11. DNA biobanking requires one blood sample (preferably at Visit 2), serum and plama samples are taken at several 
timepoints.
12. PRO should be completed prior to assessment of vital signs and in the pre-specified order (ref to section 6.2.2 )
during respective visits
13. Patient’s material include paper food diary distributed at screening. Once patient is randomised distribute a scale to 
have home weight measurements and e-diary (on their own device or on a provided smartphone).
14. 3 days food diary to be completed before the visit : includes two weekdays and one weekend day15. After the  End Of Study visit (=individual patient’s end of the study) the investigator should report only any 
cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer, trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment 
related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of and only via the BI SAE form.
16. Visit 18 is organised only for the patient to collect his medication for the remaining 2 weeks. There is no need to 
visit the site staff other than pharmacy, and injection can be done at home. If, due to site organisation, the patient comes to the site and reports AEs, these will be recorded. Last drug injection will be on week 45, day 316. 
17. When a patient discontinues treatment, he/she has to complete a End of Treatment visit ; if he/she has reached the 
normal end, the EOT visit and the visit 19 (week 46) will be combined in only one visit, containing all exams due for both visits (but not in duplicate). Patients who discontinue trial treatment prematurely should undergo the End 
of Treatment (EOT) visit 7 days after last drug intake, as well as a follow-up visit 3 weeks later. All efforts should 
be made to keep these patients in the trial, have regular weight measurements as described in section 6.2.2 and have a visit conducted at week 46. E-diary checks and patient counselling is optional at visit 19 for patients who had withdrawn drug prematurely
18. All efforts should be made at least to conduct the week 46 visit for all patients including patients who discontinue 
trial treatment prematurely and have agreed to be contacted. However, if this is not possible, a phone contactshould be made at week 46 to obtain vital status and body weight measured at home.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 20191. INTRODUCTION
1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Obesity is a chronic, complex, heterogeneous disease caused by disruption of physiological 
control of overall adiposity resulting in excessive fat accumulation. Obesity substantially 
increases the risk of metabolic diseases (for example type 2 diabetes mellitus and fatty liver 
disease), cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, myocardial infarction and stroke), musculoskeletal disease (osteoarthritis), Alzheimer disease, depression and some types of cancer (for example, breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, kidney and colon). In addition, obesity can lead to reduced quality of life, employment disparities, lower productivity and social disadvantages. For example, osteoarthritis — a common consequence of obesity — is one of the leading causes of disability and early retirement. Importantly, the World Obesity Federation and other organizations, including the American and Canadian Medical Associations, have declared obesity a chronic progressive disease clearly distinct from being a risk factor for other diseases and suggest that weight loss can improve these outcomes[R20-1944 ].
Obesity was previosly regarded solely as a lifestyle or behavioural disorder caused by 
increased calorie intake or reduced physical activity; however, current evidence suggests that obesity is caused by a disruption of homeostatic control of body weight and a failure to maintain constant body fat mass. Regulation of physiological body weight set point involvesnumerous arrays of central nervous system circuitry and peripheral metabolic feedback signals of either energy abundance or deficit, influenced by a  of genetic, developmental, biological, environmental, behavioural and iatrogenic factors. The abnormal regulation of body weight triggers a biological resistance to weight loss and a predisposition to weight gain. Currently, there are four major FDA-approved medications for chronic weight management: orlistat, phentermine/topiramate extended release (ER), naltrexone sustained release (SR)/bupropion SR and liraglutide, however those medications only provide modest reduction of body weight. Most of these drugs work through CNS pathways that either reduce appetite or enhance satiety, with the exception of orlistat, which decreases the absorption of fat [R20-1943 ]. Considering neurobiological resilience to energy homeostatic perturbations, 
combined with the heterogeneous pathophysiology of human metabolic disorders, targeting 
of multiple signalling pathways (including CNS and peripheral organs) is probably necessary. This will help patients with obesity to achive more significant improvements in weight management and might reverse the progression of these metabolic disorders and related co-morbidities. 
Targeting multiple pathways has become a standard treatment strategy in other 
diseases such as T2DM, hypertension, heart failure. It is anticipated that obesity will prove no 
different, with simultaneous activation of multiple target mechanisms, i.e. anorectic and 
thermogenic pathways, producing enhanced metabolic benefits such as improved glucose 
intolerance and lipid metabolism thereby producing meaningful and sustained clinical outcomes for treating obesity and related co-morbidities.

Mode of action
BI 456906 is a dual agonist of GLP-1 and Glucagon receptors. Targeting both GLP-1 and 
Glucagon signalling pathways is expected to provide synergistic clinical benefit for chronic 
weight management and obesity. Simultaneous dual activation of GLP-1R and GCGR by BI 456906 is anticipated to achieve improved glycaemic control, reduction in body weight and improvement in NASH. BI 456906 leads to full activation of the GLP-1R at the predicted therapeutic exposure, but only to a partial 
activation of the GCGR, which seems sufficient to achieve greater weight loss than GLP-1R 
activation alone, without hyperglycaemia.
In a 4-week study in mice with diet-induced obesity, BI 456906 was able to induce a body 
weight loss greater than liraglutide. BI 456906 dose-dependently increased energy expenditure while the pure GLP-1R agonist liraglutide had no effect even at supra-therapeutic exposure. It is expected that the increased energy expenditure will contribute to a longer lasting negative energy balance than GLP1-R agonism alone, while achieving a favourable benefit/risk profile ( c14085752-05 )

GLP-1R agonists are known to be associated with GI and cardiac side effects. Multiple studies and clinical experience from GLP-1R agonists suggest that GI side effects can be mitigated by dose escalation. Rates of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea appeared to be dose dependent for GLP-  agonists, and the proportion of patients reporting nausea was 20% lower in patients with dose escalation than without dose escalation [ R17-4311 ].
Accordingly, for a number of compounds of this class it has been shown that dose escalation 
steps are able to significantly improve tolerability in clinical practice. Cardiac conduction disorders were described for GLP-1R agonists in clinical trials and in the prescribing information for Saxenda [ R19-1407 ], reported as first-degree atrioventricular 
block, right bundle branch block, or left bundle branch block, as well as QT-prolongation. 
BI 456906 has been studied in healthy volunteers in a single rising dose trial (1404-0001). 
Similar to other GLP-1 agonists, nausea and vomiting were seen with increasing doses up to 1.2 mg and the study was discontinued early due to severe nausea and vomiting in a number of healthy volunteers. BI 456906 has also been studied in otherwise healthy volunteers with obesity or overweight 
in a multiple rising dose trial ( c21168858-06 ) with dose escalation to investigate the safety 
and tolerability of different dose escalation schemes to determine a dose escalation scheme 
that minimizes gastrointestinal adverse events. Data from the completed 6-week MRD trial
(c21168858-06 ) where BI 456906 was administered in 4 different escalation schemas (one 
once-daily dose group and 3 once-weekly dose groups, all with weekly dose escalation) were 
analysed. The most frequent AEs were gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, in participants who received BI 456906 treatment compared to placebo. Most of the reported GI AEs were transient, mild or moderate in intensity. Preliminary data out of the 16-week MRD trial where BI 456906 was administered in three different escalation schemas showed comparable safety profile to the 6-week data. The most frequent AEs were GI disorders, and most of the reported GI AEs were transient, mild or moderate in intensity. Severe AEs of gastrointestinal disorder were reported for 9 out of 45 patients treated with BI 456906. No deaths, SAEs, or protocol specified AESIs, were reported in this trial to date. 
For a more detailed description of the BI 456906 profile, please refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
1.3 RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE TRIAL
BI 456906 is a long acting dual GLP-1R and GCGR agonist being evaluated for the treatment 
of T2DM, chronic weight management for obesity/overweight, and NASH. The action of dual GLP-1R and GCGR agonist likely results from a combination of central and peripheral mechanisms, at multiple target tissues.

∀To continue the assessment of the safety of BI 456906, adjudication of some events 
will be performed in that trial. The progress of the trial will also be assessed at 
regular intervals by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). Further 
details are described in Section 8.7 , the adjudication charter and the DMC charter.
Although rare, a potential for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is under constant surveillance 
by sponsors and regulators. Therefore, this trial requires timely detection, evaluation, and follow-up of laboratory alterations in selected liv er laboratory parameters to ensure patients´ 
safety. Section 5.2.6.1.4 provides guidance for the investigators on how to evaluate and treat 
patients with suspected DILI.
Based on the pharmacological mechanism of BI 456906, the review of the non-clinical and 
clinical data available so far for this compound and considering the clinical and post-marketing data derived from the GLP-1 receptor agonists available on the market, there is no indication that BI 456906 could increase the risk of severe viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2. 
1.4.3 Discussion
BI 456906 was well tolerated in safety pharmacology and toxicology studies and the main
effects seen reflected the intended pharmacology of the compound. Single s.c. doses of 0.3 mg and 0.5 mg, but not 1.2 mg of BI 456906 were well tolerated in a single rising dose trial. In a multiple rising dose trial with weekly dose escalation up to 4.8 mg, as once weekly and twice weekly dose administrations, BI 456906 did not reveal relevant safety signals, although drug-related gastrointestinal and cardiac side effects were reported. All side effects were expected in nature, such as nausea, dyspepsia, decreased appetite, heart rate increase and cardiac conduction disorders, and are in line with other GLP-1 R agonist-based therapies. Most of the reported AEs were transient, and mild or moderate in intensity. To date, one Always serious AE from study 1404.3 occurred. It was reported as‘paroxysmal atrial fibrillation differential diagnosis ventricular tachycardia’. A 24-hour ECG (Holter Monitor) recorded from the subject at baseline (the subject had not received any dose of BI 456906) identified isolated polymorphic ventricular extrasystoles, a ventricular salve (9 beats), isolated supraventricular extrasystoles, and a supraventricular salve (4 beats). The Holter (V6/D5) used for diagnosis of the above events confirmed these findings. Initially, the investigator assessed the event as not serious. However, the event was recently upgraded to serious due to the medical significance, according to the BI Global Pharmacovigilance case processing procedure linked with the new version of the ‘Always Serious Events List’ that was implemented on 04 May 2020 and in which the event Ventricular Tachycardia was included. No deaths, or protocol specified AESIs, were reported.Overall, the potential benefits, coupled with an acceptable safety profile and a well-controlled clinical trial environment support the initiation of the trial.

The overall purpose of this trial is to assess the efficacy on weight loss and maintenance, and tolerability of four different doses of BI 456906 compared to placebo in patients with obesity or overweight (BMI ≥ 27kg/m
2), without type 1 or type 2 diabetes, in order to characterize 
the dose-response relationship within the therapeutic range, and to select the target dose(s) for 
phase III clinical development. The results of this dose-finding study will serve as Proof of Clinical Concept in patients with obesity or overweight.
2.1 MAIN OBJECTIVES, PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ENDPOINTS
2.1.1 Main objectives
This trial will characterize the dose response curve for BI 456906 in patients with BMI ≥ 27 
kg/m
2(without diabetes) by assessing 4 doses and placebo. The response is defined as the 
percentage change from baseline in body weight at Week 46. 
The main trial objectives are to demonstrate a non-flat dose response curve, to evaluate the 
size of the treatment effect (using the difference in mean percentage change between BI 456906 and placebo at Week 46), and to characterise the dose-response relationship. 
The primary treatment comparison will be randomised, without regard to whether patients 
discontinued treatment early (and whether they subsequently received any permitted anti-obesity treatments), or whether patients started the maintenance period with a lower dose than the dose that they were randomised to.
2.1.2 Primary endpoint(s)
The primary endpoint is:
- Percentage change in body weight (%) from baseline to week 46
2.1.3 Secondary endpoint(s)
Secondary endpoints are:
- Weight loss of ≥5% of baseline weight at week 46
- Weight loss of ≥10% of baseline weight at week 46
- Weight loss of ≥ 15% of baseline weight at week 46 
- Absolute change in body weight (kg) from baseline to week 46- Absolute change in waist circumference (cm) from baseline to week 46- Absolute change in systolic blood pressure (mmHg) from baseline to week 46- Absolute change in diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) from baseline to week 46

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN 
This is a 46 week randomised, double-blind, parallel-design, placebo-controlled, multi-
national and multi-centre study with 4 different maintenance doses (ranging from 
0.6mg/week to 4.8mg/week) in patients with obesity or overweight (BMI ≥ 27kg/m2), and 
without diabetes. Patients in all treatment arms including placebo will receive counselling for a reduced-calorie diet with an energy deficit of approximately 500 kcal/day by a dietician, as well as increased physical activity counselling (recommended minimum 150 minutes/week) by a qualified person on a monthly basis.
Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the 4 active dose arms of BI 456906 or 
placebo at a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio.
The different treatment arms and the dose escalation scheme are presented in Table 4.1.4:1 .
There will be a screening period of minimum one week (time needed to obtain all 
examination results), that could be extended up to 12 weeks as needed to check eligibility criteria. The lab criteria “at screening” remain sufficient for checking lab eligibility criteria at randomisation. 
The treatment duration is 46 weeks in total including a dose escalation phase of 20 weeks to 
minimize GI side effects of BI 456906. This is followed by a 26-week maintenance phase, and a 3-week (4 weeks after last dose) follow-up period.
Figure 3.1:1  Dose escalation scheme 
Screening period: Minimum 1 week, and up to 12 weeks maximum
Randomisation period: 
- Dose escalation phase: up to 20 weeks (see section 4.1.4 )
- Maintenance phase: 26 weeks
Follow up: 4 weeks after last drug injection
One interim analysis will be performed during the trial. Please refer to section 7.2.7

3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
A sufficient number of patients will be screened to ensure that an adequate number of 
patients will be randomized.A total of 350 patients in approximately 45 sites, 13 countries will be randomised. More sites may be initiated depending on recruitment rate. To ensure sufficient enrolment of men, recruitment of women will be capped at 70 % and the randomisation will be stratified according to sex.Screening of patients for this trial is generally competitive, i.e. screening for the trial will stop at all sites at the same time once a sufficient number of patients has been screened. The sponsor may require some site or country to stop recruitment in case they dominate the recruitment in a way that might cause variety or quality issues. Investigators will be notified about screening completion and will then not be allowed to screen additional patients for this trial.A log of all patients enrolled into the trial (i.e. who have signed informed consent) will be maintained in the Investigator Site File (ISF) irrespective of whether they have been treated with investigational drug or not.
If a patient is enrolled in error (does not meet all inclusion criteria or meets one or more 
exclusion criteria on the day of enrolment), the sponsor should be contacted immediately.
Re-screening is not allowed. Re-testing (of assessments) should be discussed with Clinical 
Trial Manager (CTM). 
Re-testing: 
If the investigator believes that an ineligible lab test result is the result of an error or extenuating circumstance, then that lab test can be retested once without the patient having to be re-screened. The retest should be carried out as soon as possible so the laboratory test results will be received within the next planned visit windows in order to avoid protocol window violations. 
Patients must have had a stable weight for 3 months before entering the trial. If this criterion
cannot be documented, it is possible to extend the screening period up to 12 weeks to allow checking the weight stability. Documentation upon patients’ interview is acceptable. 
3.3.1 Main diagnosis for trial entry
The main diagnosis for patients to enter the trial is BMI ≥27 kg/m
2without diabetes at 
screening.
Please refer to section 8.3.1 (Source Documents) for the documentation requirements 
pertaining to the in- and exclusion criteria.

Patients may discontinue trial treatment or withdraw consent to trial participation as a whole
(“withdrawal of consent”) with very different implications; please see sections 3.3.4.1 and 
3.3.4.2 below.
Every effort should be made to keep the patients in the trial: if possible on treatment, or at 
least to collect important trial data.Measures to control the withdrawal rate include careful patient selection, appropriate explanation of the trial requirements and procedures prior to trial enrolment, as well as theexplanation of the consequences of withdrawal. Patients should be made aware of potential anticipated GI side effects and investigators should provide guidance on how to avoid or overcome them. 
The decision to discontinue trial treatment or withdraw consent to trial participation and the 
reason must be documented in the patient files and CRF. If applicable, consider the requirements for Adverse Event collection reporting (please see sections 5.2.6.2.1 and 
5.2.6.2 ).

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019Tolerability assessment after 10 weeks 
Tolerability will be assessed after 10 weeks of treatment prior to dosing (visit 7). Patients who cannot tolerate medication in the week after dosing of week 10, will not continue titration to the next step, but will be moved to the next lower dosing available at week 11 and continue with this new scheme for the remaining visits
- Patients of Group D will then follow scheme of group C- Patients of Group C and B will then follow scheme of group A- For patients of group A, there is no lower dose possible. They will be maintained 
with same scheme, and if they again cannot tolerate at next visit they will be discontinued
Flexible dose escalation phase (week 11- week 20)
During this time, the investigator should make every effort to follow every two weeks dose 
escalation however, adjusting dosing scheme based on the patient tolerability of GI AEs will be allowed, in a blinded manner, as per the below:Tolerability will be assessed every two weeks, at every visit (prior to week 13, week 15, week 17, and week 19) and information will be entered in IRT system accordingly. 
- Patients who do not experience or who tolerate GI AEs will follow bi-weekly 
escalation schedule as described in the Table 4.1.4:1 
- Patients who cannot tolerate GI AEs will be maintained on same dose for a third 
week before next escalation. If AEs remain not tolerable despite moving to escalation every 3 weeks, that will trigger discontinuation. Training materials explaining possible options for flexible escalation will be provided to the investigators with details and examples.
Maintenance dosing phase (week 21- week 46)  
No dose adjustments or titrations will be allowed during the maintenance phase. No patients 
will start the maintenance phase at week 21 with any dose which is not one of the planned maintenance doses (0.6, 2.4, 3.6 or 4.8mg), and the dose will not be changed from week 21 until the final study visit at week 46. Patients who cannot tolerate study drug during this period despite of all the efforts taken, will be discontinued from treatment.
Injections of two syringes will occur on a weekly basis (+/- 1 day). Instructions on how to do 
self-injections will be given to patients. The patients will record the exact date and time of injections in their e-diary. If the patient does not feel comfortable giving a self-injection, this has to be discussed with site staff so that injections can be organised locally (depending on local rules, can be done eg by a local nurse, or additional visits to the site can be organized)
Missed dose (delayed or skipped) 
∀If a dose is missed on the planned dosing day, patients should take the planned dose 
within 48 hours. If more time has elapsed since the missed dose, then patients should wait to take the next planned dose. A minimum of 5 days between weekly doses is required. Patients should record the reason for a missed injection into their e-diary
∀Total skipped doses during the trial must not exceed 4 doses (2 during escalation 
phase (0-20 weeks), 2 during maintenance phase (weeks 21-46)), and must not be consecutive 2 doses. Skipping more than 4 doses will be considered as non-

discontinue trial medication. 
∀In case of consecutive 2 skipped doses, the treatment discontinuation should be 
considered (general rule). In some exceptional circumstances (e.g. COVID-19 like pandemic situation), sponsor must be contacted for alternative option. If 2 consecutive doses of study medication are missed, the patient may recommence the study treatment if considered safe as per the investigator’s discretion and the patient does not meet any of the discontinuation criteria”.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, physical visits to the sites may need to be restricted to ensure patient safety. Based on a thorough assessment of the benefits and risks, the investigator may still decide to continue the trial treatment and trial medication may be shipped to the patient’s home if acceptable according to local law and regulations, for more details see section 6.2.2
4.1.5 Blinding and procedures for unblinding
4.1.5.1 Blinding
Patients, investigators, central reviewers, and everyone involved (except as noted below) in
trial conduct or analysis or with any other interest in this double-blind trial will remain blinded with regard to the randomised treatment assignments until after database lock.
The DMC will be provided with unblinded data in order to allow them to review safety and to 
fulfil their tasks as outlined in the data monitoring committee charter. An independent team, not otherwise involved in the conduct of the trial, will provide the unblinded results to the DMC.
The randomisation codes will be provided to bioanalytics during the course of the trial to 
allow for the exclusion from the analyses of pharmacokinetic (PK) and antidrug antibodies (ADA) samples taken from placebo patients. Bioanalytics will not disclose the randomisation code or the results of their measurements until the trial is officially unblinded.
One interim analysis will be performed by an independent statistics and programming team at 
the Sponsor for internal phase III planning purposes after approximately two thirds ofrandomised patients have reached Week 20. Details are given in Section 7.2.7 , including how 
access to unblinded data and results will be controlled.
The access to the randomisation code will be kept restricted until its release for analysis.The ECGs do not represent a risk of unblinding.
4.1.5.2 Unblinding and breaking the code
Emergency unblinding will be available to the investigator via IRT. It must only be used in
an emergency situation when the identity of the trial drug must be known to the investigatorin order to provide appropriate medical treatment or otherwise assure safety of trial

Due to the requirements to report Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(SUSARs), it may be necessary for a representative from BI’s Pharmacovigilance group to access the randomisation code for individual patients during trial conduct. The access to the code will only be given to authorised Pharmacovigilance representatives for processing in the PV database system and not be shared further. 
4.1.6 Packaging, labelling, and re-supply
The investigational medicinal products will be provided by BI or a designated CRO. Syringes 
will be packaged and labelled in accordance with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). Re-supply to the sites will be managed via an IRT system, which will also monitor expiry dates of supplies available at the sites.For details of packaging and the description of the label, refer to the ISF.
4.1.7 Storage conditions
Drug supplies will be kept in their original packaging and in a secure limited access storage 
area according to the recommended storage conditions on the medication label. Atemperature log must be maintained for documentation.If the storage conditions are found to be outside the specified range, the Clinical Research Associate CRA (as provided in the list of contacts) must be contacted immediately.
Pre-filled syringes dispensed to patients at specific visits ( Flow Chart ) should be transported 
in insulated bags with cooling gel packs (or other similar cooling methods) from the site to 
the home.  Patient should store the medication at home according to the recommended storage conditions on the medication label.  Patients will not maintain a temperature log.
4.1.8 Drug accountability
The investigator or designee will receive the investigational drugs delivered by the sponsor
when the following requirements are fulfilled:
∀Approval of the clinical trial protocol by the IRB / ethics committee,
∀Availability of a signed and dated clinical trial contract between the sponsor and the 
investigational site,
∀Approval/notification of the regulatory authority, e.g. competent authority,
∀Availability of the curriculum vitae of the Principal Investigator,
∀Availability of a signed and dated clinical trial protocol,
∀Availability of the proof of a medical license for the Principal Investigator, if applicable 
∀Availability of FDA Form 1572 for USA sites

If applicable, the sponsor or warehouse / drug distribution centre will maintain records of the disposal. 
These records will include dates, quantities, batch / serial numbers, expiry (‘use- by’) dates, 
and the unique code numbers assigned to the investigational medicinal product and trialpatients. The investigator or designee will maintain records that document adequately that the patients were provided the doses specified by the Clinical Trial Protocol (CTP) and reconcile all investigational medicinal products received from the sponsor. At the time of return to the sponsor or appointed CRO, the investigator or designee must verify that all unused or partially used drug supplies have been returned by the clinical trial patient and that no remaining supplies are in the investigator’s possession.
4.2 OTHER TREATMENTS, EMERGENCY PROCEDURES, 
RESTRICTIONS
4.2.1 Other treatments and emergency procedures
4.2.1.1 Diet and physical activity counselling 
During the trial, subjects in all treatment arms including placebo will receive diet and 
physical activity counselling every month. Patients will be given an e-diary in which they will keep tracking their level of activity everyday as well as a paper diary to track their daily dietary compliance. The subject’s dietary compliance and the average daily level of physical activity will be evaluated and recorded every month by site staff into the e-CRF
Diet Counselling
At visit 2 (randomisation) subjects will receive diet counselling by a dietician or equivalent 
qualified delegates according to local standard with an energy deficit of approximately 500 kcal/day compared to the subject’s estimated total energy expenditure (TEE).[ R20-2315 ]
TEE = Basal metabolic rate (BMR) x Physical activity level (PAL) of 1.3 
The hypocaloric diet is to be continued after randomisation and throughout the treatment 
period. The TEE should be re-calculated at regular intervals based on the changes in body weight and daily physical activities during the treatment period. If a BMI ≤ 22 kg/m
2is 
reached the recommended energy intake should be recalculated with no kcal deficit (maintenance diet) for the remainder of the trial. All subjects will receive short dietary guidance materials and will be instructed by dieticians or delegates to keep a food diary. Whether or not the subject is in compliance with the prescribed diet is at the discretion of the dietician after review of the food diary

5.1 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY
5.1.1 Anthropometry 
5.1.1.1 Weight measurement
It is important to minimise variability in body weight measurement. On site, weight 
measurements should be done on the same scale for one patient throughout the course of the trial (mechanical and digital scales are acceptable), and the equipment must be calibrated according to the directions for use and at a minimum once a year. Weight should be recorded with one decimal (kg)In order to get comparable body weight values, shoes, coats/jackets, and any headgear should be taken off, and pockets should be emptied of heavy objects (i.e. keys, coins etc.). Headgear worn for religious reasons are acceptable, but this should be consistently worn for all weight measurement in the trial. Patient should empty the bladder before weight is measured. 
5.1.1.2 Self-measurement of body weight at home
All patients will be provided a scale for use at home during the trial for self- measurement of 
body weight. Patients must use the provided scale for all home weight measurements and 
measure body weight on a weekly basis. The body weight should be measured with an empty 
bladder, without shoes and only wearing light clothing, in fasting state at the same time of the day, preferably morning fasting time, throughout the trial. The measure is then recorded in an eDiary.
5.1.1.3 Height 
Height is measured at screening without shoes in centimetres (one decimal) 
5.1.1.4 Body mass index (BMI)
Body mass index will be calculated within the eCRF from visit 1 (screening) data.
5.1.1.5 Waist measurement
Waist circumference measurements should be made around a patient’s bare midriff, after the 
patient exhales while standing without shoes and with both feet touching the ground and arms hanging freely. The measuring tape should be made of a material that is not easily stretched.The tape should be placed perpendicular to the long axis of the body and horizontal to the floor and applied with sufficient tension to conform to the measurement surface. Waist circumference should be measured against the skin, at the midpoint between the lowest rib and the iliac crest.

The digital ECG recordings will be transmitted to the vendor for central reading. The ECG 
recordings will be centrally evaluated and rated as normal, abnormal, or unable to evaluate,and the results will be reported to the site. The site investigator must review the report. If the ECG is rated as abnormal, the Investigator will have to determine if the abnormal findings areclinically significant.
After the screening visit, the investigator must complete a review of the ECG results from 
central reading to ensure patient has met all the entry criteria for the study. Any pre-existing conditions should be recorded as baseline conditions. At visit 2 eligibility decisions may be made based on the local reading of the screening ECG only exceptionally, if the results of the central ECG have not been received prior to randomisation visit. ECG recorded at the randomization visit should be evaluated by the investigator before the patient receives the first dose. If abnormalities are observed by the investigator in the ECG reading at randomization visit, it is strongly recommended that the investigator wait until the results from central reading are available, and the randomization visit should be rescheduled.
The site investigator will have the responsibility of following up with the patient if there are 
any clinically significant findings in the ECG report.It is strongly recommended to repeat 12-lead ECG recording and/ or a referral to a cardiologist and/or perform additional cardiac tests (ie. Cardiac enzymes) if there is an indication of significant abnormalities or in case of doubts.Clinically relevant abnormal findings will be reported either as baseline condition (if identified at the screening visit) or otherwise as AEs and will be followed up and/or treated as medically appropriate.
After the patient is randomized, if a clinically significant increase in the QT/QTc interval 
from baseline or any other clinically significant quantitative or qualitative change from baseline is identified, the investigator will assess the symptoms (e.g., palpitations, near syncope, and syncope) and decide if the patient will continue in the study. The investigator must also ensure that patient does not meet any criteria for discontinuing study treatment (see section 3.3.4.1 ), such as tachycardia, arrhythmia or conduction disorders. Any new findings 
or deterioration of previous findings observed during the trial will be recorded as AEs/SAEs 
and will be followed up and/or treated as medically appropriate.
All ECGs that are read in the central location will be stored in the vendor’s database, and 
transmitted to the sponsor periodically
5.2.5 Other safety parameters
All cases of malignancies that are detected during the trial will be reported as SAEs. Patients 
with a history of malignancy (except for specific cancers) will be excluded from this trial per the exclusion criteria ( section 3.3.3 )

5.2.5.1 Breast neoplasm 
For all female subjects, information whether any new mammograms have been performed 
since screening must be recorded at the end of the treatment and the follow up visits. If yes, reason and diagnosis should be recorded to the extent possible.

Information whether any new endoscopic examination(s) of the colon have been performed 
since screening must be recorded at the end of the treatment and the follow up visits. If yes, reason and diagnosis should be recorded to the extent possible.
5.2.5.3 Hypoglycemia 
All subjects will at randomisation be instructed in symptom recognition and handling of
hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycemic events will be defined as 
∀The subject reported typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia or required external 
assistance.  
∀The subject’s plasma glucose concentration was <54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L), 
∀The investigator considered the event to be hypoglycaemia event. 
All symptomatic hypoglycaemic events will be recorded as a hypoglycaemic event on the 'adverse event' CRF page. 
5.2.5.4 Mental health questionnaires
The mental health status of subjects will be assessed by C-SSRS and PHQ-9 questionnaires.
The C-SSRS is a semi-structured, investigator-rated interview, developed by clinical experts 
in cooperation with the FDA, assessing both suicidal behaviour and suicidal ideation.  It does not give a global score but provides some categorical and some severity information specifically for behaviour and ideation.
The C-SSRS interview may be administered by any type of physician, psychologist, clinical 
social worker, mental health counsellor, nurse, or research coordinator with C-SSRS training. It has a typical duration of five minutes and causes only a low burden on patients. At a minimum, the interview consists of 2 screening questions related to suicidal ideation and 4 related to suicidal behaviour and may be expanded to up to 17 items in case of positive responses.
The C-SSRS has been widely used in large multinational clinical trials. The C-SSRS will be 
administered at the screening visit (using the “baseline/screening” version) with the aim to exclude subjects with a lifetime history of suicidal ideation and behaviour. After the baseline visit, the assessment “since last visit” will be performed at clinic visits as specified in the Flow Chart . The investigator is to review positive and negative reports for plausibility and

If there is a positive report of suicidal behaviour or suicidal ideation type 4 or 5 after start of trial, the investigator is to immediately interview the patient during the clinic visit and advise the patient to consult with a psychiatrist. If the positive report is confirmed, appropriate actions for the patient’s safety must be initiated. Treatment with study drug should be stopped and patient should be discontinued from the trial. Additionally, all C-SSRS reports of suicidal ideation type 4 or 5 and all reports of suicidal behaviour must be reported as separate SAEs by the investigator. For ‘Self-injurious behaviour, no suicidal intent’ (Type 11) standard AE / SAE reporting rules are to be applied. For each negative report (suicidal ideation type 1, 2 or 3) after start of the trial, the investigator is to decide based on clinical judgment whether it represents an AE as defined in the protocol, and if it is considered an AE then it must be reported accordingly.
The PHQ-9 is the 9-item depression module of the patient health questionnaire, which is a 
self-administered diagnostic tool used for assessment of mental disorders. The questionnaire takes approximately 10 minutes to complete
5.2.6 Assessment of adverse events
5.2.6.1 Definitions of AEs 
5.2.6.1.1 Adverse event
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
The following should also be recorded as an AE in the CRF and BI SAE form (if applicable):
∀Worsening of the underlying disease or of other pre-existing conditions 
∀Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination and laboratory test results, if they 
are judged clinically relevant by the investigator.
If such abnormalities already exist prior to trial inclusion, they will be considered as baseline 
conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only.
5.2.6.1.2 Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE, which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria:
- results in death,- is life-threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe,
- requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019- results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,- is a congenital anomaly / birth defect,- is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based 
on appropriate medical judgement which may jeopardise the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation or development of dependency or abuse. 
5.2.6.1.3 AEs considered “Always Serious”
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs, which by their nature, can always be considered to be “serious” even though they may not have met the criteria of an SAE as defined above.
The latest list of “Always Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC system. A copy of the latest 
list of “Always Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. These events should always be reported as SAEs as described in section 5.2.6.2 .
Adverse Event (AE) coded shall cross referenced against the Always Serious List (ASL). 
Non serious cases will be upgraded to serious. Cardiac related events included in the ASL, shall be fully processed as serious and expedited
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the time since discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as described in 5.2.6.2 , subsections “AE Collection” and “ AE reporting to sponsor and 
timelines”.
5.2.6.1.4 Adverse events of special interest
The term adverse events of special interest (AESI) relates to any specific AE that has been 
identified at the project level as being of particular concern for prospective safety monitoring and safety assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESIs need to be reported to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAEs, please see section 5.2.6.2.2 .
The following are considered as AESIs:
Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury is defined by the following alterations of hepatic laboratory parameters: 
∀an elevation of AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and/or ALT (Alanine 
Aminotransferase) ≥3-fold ULN combined with an elevation of total bilirubin ≥2-fold
ULN measured in the same blood draw sample, or
∀aminotransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥10-fold ULN.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these lab abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the eDC systemIn case of clinical symptoms of hepatic injury (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy, unexplained coagulopathy, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are analysed, if necessary in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of hepatic injury alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed.
5.2.6.1.5 Adverse events require additional data collection 
Some pre-specified AEs critical for the assessment of safety of BI 456906 will require 
additional data collection with separate eCRF page, some of these events will be centrally adjudicated in a blinded fashion by an independent external Clinical Event Committee (CEC). Definitions of the adjudicated endpoint events and the principles of standardised data collection in the centralised CEC adjudication process are outlined in the separate CEC Charter and process guideline.  
Events require adjudications 
∀All death (CV death, non-CV death) 
∀Cardiovascular event (revascularization due to coronary vascular disease, myocardial 
infarction, hospitalization due to unstable angina)  
∀Cerebrovascular disease (Stoke, TIA)
∀Heart failure hospitalisation. 
∀Pancreatitis 
∀Neoplasm 
∀Thyroid mass requires surgery 
Events require additional data collection 
∀Acute gall bladder disease
∀Acute pancreatitis 
∀Thyroid mass 
5.2.6.1.6 Intensity (severity) of AEs
The intensity (severity) of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or symptom(s) that is/are easily tolerated.Moderate: Sufficient discomfort to cause interference with usual activity.Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities.
As GI and cardiac AEs have been shown to be associated with pharmacological doses of
GLP-1R agonists and glucagon, the intensity of such AEs is defined as follows for thisclinical trial:

5.2.6.1.7 Causal relationship of AEs
Medical judgement should be used to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility of a 
causal relationship between the adverse event and the given study treatment, considering all relevant factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de-challenge or re-challenge, confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant history. 
Arguments that may suggest that there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
could be:
∀The event is consistent with the known pharmacology of the drug.
∀The event is known to be caused by or attributed to the drug class.
∀A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
∀Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re-introduced.
∀No medically sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre-
existing or concomitant diseases, or co-medications).
∀The event is typically drug-related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome).
∀An indication of dose-response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is reduced).
Arguments that may suggest that there is no reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
could be:
∀No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre-treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days / weeks 
of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug concerned).
∀Continuation of the event despite the withdrawal of the medication, considering the 
pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half-lives).Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged despite removing the original trigger.
∀Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation (e.g. 
situations where other drugs or underlying diseases appear to provide a more likely explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned).
∀Disappearance of the event even though the trial drug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate CRF(s) by the investigator:• From signing the informed consent onwards until the individual patient’s end of study:
all AEs (serious and non-serious) and all AESIs.
• After the individual patient’s end of study: 
the investigator does not need to actively monitor the patient for new AEs but should only report any occurrence of cancer and trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of by any means of communication, e.g. phone call. Those AEs should be reported on the BI SAE form (see section 5.2.6.2.2 ), but not on the CRF.
Vital Status Data Collection
Patients who discontinue trial medication prematurely, who agree to be contacted further but do not agree to physical visits, should be followed up as described in section 3.3.4.1 , 
withdrawal from trial treatment. From then on until the individual patient’s end of the trial the 
investigator must report all deaths/fatal AEs regardless of relationship, and trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESIs the investigator becomes aware of. 
5.2.6.2.2 AE reporting to the sponsor and timelines
The investigator must report SAEs, AESIs, and non-serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form via fax immediately (within 24 hours ) to the sponsor’s unique entry point (country specific contact details will be provided in the ISF). The same timeline applies if follow-up information becomes available. In specific occasions,the investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the requirement to complete and fax the BI SAE form.
With receipt of any further information to these events, a follow-up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow-up information the same rules and timeline apply as for initial information. All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient’s end of trial must be followed up until they have resolved, have been assessed as “chronic” or “stable”, or no further information can be obtained.
5.2.6.2.3 Pregnancy
In rare cases, pregnancy might occur in a clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled in the 
clinical trial and has taken trial medication, the investigator must report any drug exposure during pregnancy in a trial participant immediately (within 24 hours) by means of Part A of the Pregnancy Monitoring Form to the sponsor’s unique entry point.The outcome of the pregnancy associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy must be followed up and reported to the sponsor’s unique entry point on the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Studies (Part B).The ISF will contain the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Studies (Part A and B).
As pregnancy itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompanying SAE 
and/or AESI, only the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Studies and not the SAE form is to be completed. If there is an SAE and/or AESI associated with the pregnancy an SAE form must be completed in addition.

5.5 BIOBANKING
Participation in biobanking is voluntary and not a prerequisite for participation in the trial.
Biobanking will only occur after a separate biobanking informed consent has been given inaccordance with local ethical and regulatory requirements. No samples will be taken for biobanking from patients at sites in China due to regulatory restrictions.
In order to be able to address future scientific questions, patients will be asked to voluntarily
donate biospecimens for banking. If the patient agrees, banked samples may be used forfuture biomarker research and drug development projects, e.g. to identify patients that aremore likely to benefit from a treatment or experience an AE, or to gain a mechanistic orgenetic understanding of drug effects and thereby better match patients with therapies.Samples will be stored for testing for a period consistent with local regulations.
5.5.1 Methods and timing of sample collection
Detailed instructions on sampling, preparation, processing, shipment and storage are provided 
in the laboratory manual. For sampling timepoints see Flow Chart .
Approximately 48 mL blood will be drawn for DNA, Plasma, and Serum banking.

All measurements performed during this trial are standard measurements and will be 
performed in order to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of BI456906 and to determine pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters in an appropriate way. The scheduled measurements will allow monitoring of changes in vital signs, standard laboratory values, and ECG parameters that might occur as a result of administration of study drug. The safety assessments are standard, are accepted for evaluation of safety and tolerability of an s.c. administered drug and are widely used in clinical trials. The pharmacokinetic parameters and measurements outlined are generally used assessments of drug exposure.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 20196. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
For a detailed overview of the trial procedures and time windows for visits, please refer to the 
Flow Chart .
The trial consists of a screening visit followed by a 46-week treatment period and a follow-up 
visit. The study will last until every randomised patient has completed the last follow-up visit.
After giving his/her Informed Consent, the patient will be screened for inclusion and 
exclusion criteria for the study at visit 1. Visit 2 will be scheduled after visit 1, after results from central laboratory are obtained, as well as ECG central review. The minimum interval between screening and randomization is 1week. The patient will be randomized at visit 2 if all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are fulfilled.During the treatment period, there will be a dose escalation period of 20 weeks followed by a dose maintenance period. Total treatment period is 46 weeks.
Windows of ±1 or ±2 days is allowed to accommodate scheduling problems. If a delay is 
observed for a particular visit, the original calendar schedule should be kept for subsequent visits (delays should not accumulate). If a visit is missed the patient should be instructed to reach out to the investigator as soon as possible. Handling of missed drug injections is described in section 4.1.4 . Investigator should contact the BI monitor to discuss further 
schedule.
Follow up visits have to be organized a minimum of 28 days after last drug injection. 
Patients with obesity are in general at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. In 
exceptional cases, if standard visits at the trial sites are impossible because of COVID-19 related safety risks, trial conduct may need to be adjusted, strictly consistent with local public 
health guidance and regulations.If, in order to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID-19, physical visits should be avoided , the use of remote visits (via phone and/or internet-based means of communication) and local laboratory services for safety and efficacy parameters measurements should be considered if possible. However, study drug shipment to patients might not be possible in all countries to be included. In such situations, picking up trial medication could be done by patient’s delegate or by patient at a sterile pharmacy (e.g. “drive -through” , “isolated” pharmacy).Investigators should complete study procedures according to the protocol to the extent possible. The max. number of missing doses of study medication is defined in section 4.1.4 .
Considering all aspects, the investigator will decide upon each patient’s (continued) 
participation in the planned trials. BI as the sponsor, where required, will support the investigator in their decision finding. It is acknowledged that the investigator may decide to implement protocol deviations where this protects the safety, wellbeing and/or is in the best interest of the patient. All home/remote visits need to be discussed with and approved by the sponsor`s trial team. Local regulatory and legal requirements of the participating country still applyAll COVID-19 related deviations from the original schedule of visits and procedures will be documented and the implications considered for the analysis of the trial data.

6.2.1 Screening and run-in period(s)
Screening Period
Following informed consent, the patient will undergo visit 1/screening assessments as 
indicated in the Flowchart . Once the patient has consented, the patient is considered to be 
enrolled in the trial. The patient should be recorded on the enrolment log and be registered in 
the IRT.The assessments must all fall within the acceptable screening visit window but do not need to be performed on the same day.
Re-testing for certain eligibility criteria can be performed once as outlined in section 3.3 . 
The screening phase can be extended up to a maximum of 12 weeks (from visit 1 to visit 2), 
when needed to allow proper documentation of weight stability. If the patient meets the entrycriteria, visit 2 should occur as soon as possible once it has been confirmed that the patient iseligible to continue.If the patient does not meet the entry criteria, (i.e. fail to meet one or more of the inclusioncriteria, and/or meet one or more of the exclusion criteria) following Visit 1 procedures, they should be registered as a screen failure in IRT.
6.2.2 Treatment period(s)
Before visit 2, patients will have to record their food intake in a 3-days food diary (see 
section 5.1.5 ). 
Patients who meet all the protocol criteria will be randomized at visit 2. After randomization, 
patients will start the treatment period which includes a dose escalation phase, followed by the dose maintenance phase as shown in Figure 3.1: 1 .
Procedures to be completed at each visit can be found in the Flow Chart.
At visits specified in the Flow Chart, patients should be instructed to come in the fasting state 
after at least 10 hours without food intake.  Water intake is allowed. On days when fasting is required, the clinic visit should ideally be scheduled in the mornings, if this is convenient for the patient.

A follow up visit has to be organized after a minimum of 4 weeks after last drug injection as 
outlined in the Flow Chart (FC). 
Procedures to be completed at the follow-up visit can be found in the Flow Chart. The 
sequence of visit procedures will be the same as in the treatment period.
If a patient had withdrew drug prematurely, he should also come for that follow-up visit. In 
addition, the patient will be asked to return to clinic every 4 weeks to measure body weight until the end of the planned treatment period, i.e. week 46. All efforts should be made at least to conduct the week 46 visit for all patients.However, if this is not possible, a phone contact should be made at week 46 to obtain vital status and body weight measured at home on the study scale.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 20197. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF
SAMPLE SIZE
The primary trial objective includes demonstration of PoCC with respect to a non-flat dose 
response curve, characterization of the dose-response relationship within the therapeutic range, and selection of the dose range for phase III development. For this purpose, the primary analysis uses methodology for dose finding employing both multiple comparison procedures and modelling techniques (MCPMod).
7.1 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
The null hypothesis is that there is a flat dose response curve across the placebo and the BI 
456906 dose groups, with regard to the primary endpoint of percentage change in body weight from baseline to Week 46. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a non-flat dose response curve indicating a benefit of BI 456906 over Placebo. 
The MCPMod procedure allows for simultaneous evaluation of different potential dose 
response patterns, whilst protecting the overall probability of Type I error (one sided 2.5%). The pre-specified models and their parameters used for this test are outlined in Section 7.2.2 .
No confirmatory hypothesis testing will be performed in this trial.
7.2 PLANNED ANALYSES
7.2.1 General considerations
Analysis Sets
Statistical analysis will be based on the following analysis sets: 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) is defined as all randomised patients who received at least one 
dose of study treatment and who have analysable data for at least one efficacy endpoint.
The Treated Set (TS) is defined as all randomised patients who received at least one dose of 
study treatment.
The Pharmacokinetic Set (PKS) is defined as all patients in the TS who provided at least one 
BI 456906 concentration which was not excluded due to non-evaluability or an important protocol deviation relevant for PK. 
Important Protocol Deviations
Important protocol deviation (IPD) categories will be defined in the IPD specification 
document. IPDs will be identified no later than in the Report Planning Meeting (RPM).
IPDs may include (but not necessarily be limited to) the following:
∀Violation of inclusion or exclusion criteria
∀Major deviations from scheduled timing of assessments
∀Non-compliance with trial medication

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019∀Treatment dispensing errors
∀Use of prohibited or restricted concomitant medication.
Definition of baseline
In general, unless otherwise specified in the TSAP, the last non-missing measurement on or 
prior to the date of first dose of study treatment will be used as baseline for efficacy and safety variables. 
Definition of on-treatment
For the purposes of on-treatment efficacy analyses, the definition of “on-treatment” will be 
given in the TSAP.
For the purposes of on-treatment safety analyses, an assessment (or AE start date) will be 
considered “on-treatment” if the assessment date (or AE start date) is between the date of first dose and 28 days after the date of last dose of study treatment.
7.2.2 Primary endpoint analyses
The analysis for PoCC and dose-finding will be performed using multiple comparison and 
modelling techniques (MCPMod) [ R10-1424 ] whereby several possible dose response 
models (patterns) will be evaluated, while keeping full control of the type I error at 2.5%
(one-sided) to identify the best-fitting model or subset of models. 
To account for repeated body weight measurements over time and for inclusion of baseline 
covariates in the model, a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis will first be 
carried out. The MMRM will include fixed effects for baseline body weight and baseline by visit interaction as continuous covariates, and treatment, gender, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction as factors. Unstructured covariance will be used to model the relationship between pairs of endpoint measurements taken at different visits on the same patient. The Kenward-Roger approximation will be used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom. The TSAP will specify approaches to be taken to resolve possible non-convergence issues, including if necessary, the selection of a simpler covariance structure.
Covariate-adjusted fixed effect estimates of mean percentage change in body weight at Week 
46 for each treatment group and the covariance matrix will be extracted from the MMRM fit. These will be used for the subsequent MCPMod analysis. 
For the PoCC testing and for the sample size calculation, the basic shape of each of the 
models to be tested must be pre-defined. The following model assumptions and resulting graphs ( Figure 7.2.2: 1 ) have been selected to cover a plausible and diverse range of 
monotone dose response patterns, with placebo mean response assumed to be zero and the 
mean response at the highest BI 456906 dose assumed to be -10.0 (i.e. a percentage reduction from baseline in body weight of 10%):

Figure 7.2.2: 1 Dose response patterns considered for the MCPMod analysis.
PoCC will be established if at least one model is statistically significant, rejecting the null 
hypothesis of a flat dose response relationship for percentage change in body weight jointly over the candidate dose response models, with a contrast test controlled for the family–wise type I error rate at one sided α = 2.5%. 
If PoCC is established, the statistically significant (best fitting) model(s) from the above 
candidate set will be refitted to the data to generate new estimates for all model parameters from the data. The target dose(s) will be estimated from the best fitting model(s) by incorporating information on the minimum clinically relevant effect and accounting for safety. 
The primary analysis of percentage change from baseline in body weight at Week 46 will be 
performed using the FAS and will assign patients to the randomised maintenance dose. It will include all available data without regard to whether patients started the maintenance period

For patients who discontinued treatment early, a distinction will be made according to whether this is due to a COVID-19 pandemic-related reason or not. Patients who discontinued treatment early due to a pandemic-related reason (e.g. direct COVID-19 infection, drug supply issue, site closure, quarantine preventing site access) will have data handled after discontinuation as if they were missing. Patients who discontinued treatment early for any other reason will have all available data included after discontinuation, irrespective of whether such patients subsequently received any permitted anti-obesity treatments.
The above approach to the primary analysis specifies a hypothetical strategy for the 
intercurrent event of pandemic-related early treatment discontinuation, and a treatment policy strategy for the intercurrent event of non-pandemic-related early treatment discontinuation.
The primary endpoint will be summarised descriptively overall, and by pre-specified 
subgroups (to be specified in the TSAP, but which may include e.g. subgroups based on gender, baseline BMI and age at screening).
7.2.3 Secondary endpoint analyses
The responder secondary endpoints (percentage change from baseline < -5.0% and < -10.0%
in body weight at Week 46, respectively) will be summarised descriptively. 
Logistic regression with treatment group and gender as factors and baseline body weight as a 
continuous linear covariate will be used to estimate the odds ratio for each active BI 456906 dose compared with placebo, and to provide covariate-adjusted estimates of the proportion of responders at each BI 456906 dose.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019The analyses of the responder endpoints will be aligned with the treatment policy and hypothetical strategy approaches respectively in Section 7.2.2 for handing early treatment 
discontinuation and missing data. As a first step, multiple imputation will be performed on 
the underlying continuous endpoint to generate multiple imputed datasets, each one containing complete data for every patient. A minimum of 100 imputed datasets will be used for this purpose. The imputation model will assume that a patient with missing data follows a similar trajectory to a patient without missing data in the same treatment group (with similar baseline covariates and observed values). The responder endpoints will be derived from the complete data in each of the imputed datasets, and then analysed using the logistic regression model specified above. Finally, the estimates from the logistic regression model will be combined across the imputed datasets in a way which correctly accounts for the within and between imputation variance. Further technical details of the multiple imputation will be provided in the TSAP.
Continuous secondary endpoints measured repeatedly over time will be summarised 
descriptively and analysed using an MMRM similar to the one specified in Section 7.2.2, except that baseline body weight will be replaced in the model by the baseline value of the relevant endpoint. The model will be used to obtain covariate-adjusted mean estimates of differences between active BI 456906 doses and placebo at the relevant time point. 
MCPMod dose finding analyses will not be performed for any secondary endpoints.

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 20197.2.5 Safety analyses
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA). Standard BI summary tables and listings will be produced. All adverse events with an onset between start of treatment and end of the residual effect period (REP), a period of 28 days after the last dose of trial medication, will be assigned to the on-treatment period for evaluation.
Safety analyses will be performed on the Treated Set (TS), using the actual maintenance 
treatment received. Key safety analyses will also be performed using the randomised maintenance treatment (if this is different for any patient). 
In general, safety analyses will be descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No 
hypothesis testing is planned.
Statistical analysis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment-emergent 
adverse events, i.e. all adverse events occurring between start of treatment and end of the REP.
Frequency, severity, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated by system 
organ class and preferred term after coding according to the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) at database lock.
The adjudicated events specified in Section 5.2.6.1.5 will be summarised descriptively for 
each treatment group.
Laboratory data will be analysed both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. The latter will 
be done via comparison of laboratory data to their reference ranges. Values outside the reference range as well as values defined as clinically relevant will be summarised. Treatment groups will be compared descriptively with regard to distribution parameters as well as with regard to frequency and percentage of patients with abnormal values or clinically relevant abnormal values.
Vital signs, physical examinations and 12-lead ECG observed at screening, baseline, during 
the course of the trial and at the end-of-trial evaluation will be assessed with regard to possible changes compared to findings before start of treatment.

∀A maximum effect size (mean percentage change from baseline in body weight at 
Week 46) in the highest dose group of -10.0%
∀A standard deviation of 7.0% [ R20-0479 ].
Simulations were also performed to investigate departures from the assumed true maximum 
effect stated above, as well as for different scenarios for the true nature of the dose response relationship. The probability of success for each of these scenarios is summarised in Table 
7.5: 1 below. 
A success was defined as meeting all 3 of the following criteria:
1. Null hypothesis of flat dose response was rejected in favour of at least one of the 
alternative candidate models, and  
2. A target dose was selected within the dose range using the following criterion: 
difference in mean between selected dose and placebo < -9.0%, and
3. Proportion of patients in the highest dose group meeting the responder definition 
(percentage change in body weight from baseline < -10.0%) was greater than 35%.

Table 7.5: 1 . For each scenario, 10000 simulations were again used. For simplicity, only the 
average probability of a successful outcome across the different assumptions on functional

8.2 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE
A risk-based approach is used for trial quality management. It is initiated by the assessment 
of critical data and processes for trial subject protection and reliability of the results as well as identification and assessment of associated risks. An Integrated Quality and Risk Management Plan documents the rationale and strategies for risk management during trial conduct including monitoring approaches, vendor management and other processes focusing on areas of greatest risk.Continuous risk review and assessment may lead to adjustments in trial conduct, trial design or monitoring approaches. A quality assurance audit/inspection of this trial may be conducted by the sponsor, sponsor’s 
designees, or by IRB / IEC or by regulatory authorities. The quality assurance auditor will have access to all medical records, the investigator’s trial-related files and correspondence, and the informed consent documentation of this clinical trial.
8.3 RECORDS
CRFs for individual patients will be provided by the sponsor. See section 4.1.5.2 for rules 
about emergency code breaks. For drug accountability, refer to section 4.1.8 .
8.3.1 Source documents
In accordance with regulatory requirements, the investigator should prepare and maintain 
adequate and accurate source documents and trial records that include all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each trial patient. Source data as well as reported data should follow the “ALCOA principles” and be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, 
original and accurate. Changes to the data should be traceable (audit trail).
Data reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source data or the discrepancies must be explained.
The current medical history of the patient may not be sufficient to confirm eligibility for the 
trial and the investigator may need to request previous medical histories and evidence of any diagnostic tests. In this case, the investigator must make at least one documented attempt to retrieve previous medical records. If this fails, a verbal history from the patient, documented in their medical records, would be acceptable.
Copies of source documents necessary for adjudication of events and ECG central reading
will be provided to the corresponding vendors. Before sending or uploading those copies, the investigator must ensure that all patient identifiers (e.g. patient’s name, initials, address, phone number, social security number) have properly been removed or redacted from any copy of the patients’ source documents. The electronic version of the ECG is regarded as source data. Dated and signed printouts will be stored in the participant’s medical file.
For eDiary, the electronic record is the source document.

∀Prior to allocation of a patient to a treatment into a clinical trial, there must be 
documented evidence in the source data (e.g. medical records) that the trial participant meets all inclusion criteria and does not meet any exclusion criteria. The absence of records (either medical records, verbal documented feedback of the patient or testing conducted specific for a protocol) to support inclusion/exclusion criteria does not make the patient eligible for the clinical trial.
8.3.2 Direct access to source data and documents
The investigator /institution will allow site trial-related monitoring, audits, IRB / IEC review 
and regulatory inspections. Direct access must be provided to the CRF and all source documents/data, including progress notes, copies of laboratory and medical test results, which must be available at all times for review by the CRA, auditor and regulatory inspector (e.g. FDA).

001-MCS-40-106 RD-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019Temporary halt of the trial is defined as any unplanned interruption of the trial by the 
sponsor with the intention to resume it.Suspension of the trial is defined as an interruption of the trial based on a Health Authority 
request.The IEC / competent authority in each participating EU member state will be notified about the trial milestones according to the respective laws.A final report of the clinical trial data will be written only after all patients have completed the trial in all countries (EU or non-EU) to incorporate and consider all data in the report.The sponsor will submit to the EU database a summary of the final trial results within one year from the end of a clinical trial as a whole, regardless of the country of the last patient(EU or non-EU).
8.7 ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE OF THE TRIAL
The trial is sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim (BI).
A Coordinating Investigator is responsible to coordinate investigators at the different sites 
participating in this trial. Tasks and responsibilities are defined in a contract. 
An independent external committee (Clinical Event Committee, [CEC]) will be established to 
adjudicate some events, as specified in section 5 , jointly with trial 1404-0043 (BI 456906 
dose finding trial in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)).
Events will be adjudicated by external independent event adjudication committee; both in a 
blinded fashion. Events to be reviewed will be defined in a charter.
Events may either be defined by abnormal laboratory values and/or relevant adverse events or 
both.
For qualifying events, relevant source documents generated from any medical evaluations of 
these events will be requested including for example laboratory values, histological analysis, reports from ultrasound, CT, MRI, scintigraphy, hospital discharge letters, and medical reports from other physicians. All evaluations will be performed in a blinded fashion. 
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established, jointly with trial 1404.43.
Members of the DMC are independent of BI, they are physicians experienced in the treatment of the disease under investigation and a statistician. The DMC will evaluate safety data. The DMC will receive urgent significant safety concerns, and cases of DILI, for immediate evaluation. While DMC members may be unblinded, measures are in place to ensure the blinding for everyone else involved in the trial. Regular DMC meetings will be held at specified intervals. The DMC will recommend continuation, modification or termination of the trial as detailed in the DMC charter. DMC recommendations as well as the final BI decision will be reported to the appropriate Regulatory Authorities (RAs)/Health Authorities (HAs), IRBs/ECs, and to investigators as requested by local law. The tasks and responsibilities of the DMC are specified in a charter.
Relevant documentation on the participating (Principal) Investigators (e.g. their curricula 
vitae) will be filed in the ISF.

10.2 BLOOD PRESSURE MEASUREMENT PROCEDURE
Initially, blood pressure should be taken in both arms. If the pressures differ by more than 10 
mmHg (as in the presence of a subclavian steal syndrome), obtain readings in both arms. The arm with the highest pressure (either systolic or diastolic) should be used for all subsequent measurements.  Blood pressure measurements should be performed on the same arm and, if possible, by thesame person. The same method and device must be used throughout the trial for a patient.After patients have rested quietly, in the seated position for five minutes, three blood pressuremeasurements will be taken two minutes apart and all three results will have to be entered inthe CRF. The seated pulse rate will be taken during the two-minute interval between thesecond and third blood pressure reading.
Blood pressure measurements should be recorded to the nearest 2 mmHg when applicable

points specified in the Flow Chart. Centralized ECG services will be provided by an external vendor. ECGs should be collected according to 
the study-specific recommendations, using the 
standardized equipment provided by the vendor. ECGs may be repeated for quality or safety reasons. Patients must be supine for approximately 5-10 minutes before ECG collection. Patients should remain supine, but awake, during the ECG collection process.
The investigator has the responsibility to 
complete an initial review as soon as the ECG recordings are obtained at the site visit.

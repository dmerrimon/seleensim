2. STUDY RATIONAL 
 
Background:  Chronic  hand dermatitis (also known as hand eczema; CHD) is one of the 
most disabling skin conditions that negatively affect quality of life and work capacity of affected patients. Hands and often wrists present with erythema, edema, scaling and 
fissuring  accompanied by intense pruritus and pain. Thyssen JP et al, reported the point 
prevalence of hand dermatitis (1994- 2007) was around 4%, the 1- year prevalence nearly 
10%, whereas the lifetime prevalence reached 15%.  A high incidence rate is associated 
with female gender, contact allergy, atopic  dermatitis , and wet work environment.ii Hand 
dermatitis is a heterogeneous disease entity, with irritant and allergic contact dermatitis 
and atopic dermatitis (AD) as the main causative factors.  The common denominator of 
CHD subtypes is a skin barrier dysfunction, which not only facilitates cutaneous 
penetration of allergens and irritants but also induces local immune activation.  Currently, 
the management of CHD involves patient education about avoidance of irritants and 
allergens, skin protection measures, and topical (high and mid potency steroids, 
calcineurin inhibitors) or systemic anti -inflammatory therapy (e.g. corticosteroids,

 alitretinoin, cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine). Overall the rate of treatment 
success is poor with great dissatisfaction from patients and providers. While previous 
approaches to CHD have been focused on broad spectrum suppression of immune 
responses, we are interested in a targeted approach to restore proper skin barrier integrity 
and resistance to absorption of environmental allergens/hapten/irritant while also blocking the cytokine mediated inflammation.   
It is our hypothesis that daily application of a topical JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor (Ruxolitinib) will induce clinical improvement of CHD by restoring skin barrier function and reducing skin driven inflammation.  
 
Preliminary study:  The epidermal skin barrier is composed of the stratum corneum (SC), 
which is made up of terminally differentiated keratinocytes surrounded by a complex lipid 
structure and the tight junctions (TJs), which are present just below the SC. TJs are made 
up of a  number of adhesive and scaffolding proteins that control the passage of 
physiologic liquids, water, ions, and solutes through the paracellular pathway. Expression 
of key barrier proteins (e.g. claudin- 1, loricrin, filaggrin and cytokeratin 10) was found t o 
be reduced in biopsies from CHD patients. Notably, in patients treated with oral alitretinoin 
the improved expression of these markers correlated with clinical efficacy, suggesting that 
alitretinoin exhibits a disease‐ modifying activity by skin barrier r epair mechanismiii.   
Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors  block cytokine -mediated signaling via the  Janus  kinase-
signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK -STAT) pathway, which plays an 
important role in immunoregulation and cell growth.  Furthermore, recent studies have 
shown a critical role played by JAK1 signaling in sensory neurons driven chronic itchiv. 
JAK- STATs are heavily expressed in the epidermis and involved in critical epidermal 
barrier pathways.  Studies on epithelial model have shown that JAKs play a role in TJ 
protein expressionv. Consistently, preliminary data generated in our laboratory showed 
that Ruxolitinib was able to rescue IFN ɣ-induced TJ disruption (Fig 1).   
 
Design & Methodology.  This is an investigator -initiated, proof of concept, open study to 
assess efficacy of a topical Ruxolitinib  in subjects with CHD.  The study will be conducted 
at the University of Rochester Medical center, Dermatology Department – Rochester, NY. Fig 1.  In Primary human keratinocytes IFNɣ reduced TransEpithelial Electric resistance (TEER) and this was 
associated to disruption of TJ - Ruxolitinib (Rux) rescued IFN ɣ induced TJ damage.  A) TransEpithelial Electric 
resistance measures TJ integrity: reduced TEER  
reduced barrier integrity. B -D) Keratinocytes were stained with ZO -1 (TJ markers) 120hr post differentiation.

 Qualified and enrolled subjects (see Inclusion/exclusion criteria) will be required to come 
to URMC Dermatology Clinic for at least f ive visits: visit 1 (V1, day 0), start of active 
treatment; visit 2 - 4 weeks treatment; visit 3 – 8 weeks and visit 4 – 12 weeks and end 
of the active study; visit 5 post treatment follow uo, 4 weeks (V 5, 112+/- 3 days post V1).  
To ensure feasibility of enrollment, and in subjects requiring  a washout period, we will 
include a screening visit (up to 28 days +/ - 3 prior to V1).  As part of the screening, 
subjects with possible contact allergy dermatitis (CAD)  will undergo PATCH testing (70 
common allergens, North America series; see exclusion criteria) or they must have 
documentation of test performed 3 years prior screening.  In patient with CHD avoidance 
of the allergens should be the first measure to ensure successful treatment . Subjects with 
known antigen sensitization based on Patch test (with 3 years) that are unable to reduce 
contact with the specific antigen(s) will be excluded.   
We will also exclude patients with active lesions of Atopic Dermatitis and Psoriasis ( see 
exclusion criteria), as they might need additional systemic or topical treatment that could 
indirectly affect hand dermatitis severity during the study.  
Subjects will apply topical Ruxolitinib 1.5% cream twice a day  for 12 weeks  on 
eczematous areas of hands and adjoining clinically normal (perilesional) area. We 
included non- lesional/perilesional skin to evaluate the safety (e.g. irritant or toxic effects) 
of the compound on irritated/atopic  skin, as those subjects have a lower irritancy 
thresholdvi. Also, skin barrier impairment (e.g. increase water loss/TEWL) can be already 
detected in normal appearing skin in atopic subjects and it is thought to allow penetration 
of hapten/allergen/irritant with consequent activation of an inflammatory response. I t is 
our hypothesis that treatment with topical Ruxolitinib , a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor , will 
normalize skin barrier integrity in per ilesion  skin. During the study, subjects will be allowed 
to stay on  bland moisturizer  and anti-histamine  on a stabilized dose  and expected to 
maintain this dose throughout the study.  In addition to clinical and safety outcomes, 
the study design will include exploratory  mechanistic outcomes , in a stepwise tactic. 
During the trial we will collect: 1) non -invasive skin barrier assessment (i.e. TEWL, SC 
integrity score); 2) stratum corneum extract to investigate potential biomarkers and skin microbiome  (stored for fu ture investigation); 3) Patient oriented outcomes. If the data 
gathered from the clinical trial demonstrates the clinical improvement we expect, the mechanistic studies will be extremely relevant to start clarifying  specific target 
downstream to Ruxolitinib efficacy in CHD as well as biomarkers that could eventually be 
investigated in consequent larger clinical trials.

Study procedures & methods  
- Disease status assessment: 1)  Investigator Global Assessment (IGA), which will 
provide information of the overall disease ( 5-point scale: clear, almost clear, mild, 
moderate, severe) and it is the score requested by FDA for clinical study . Data will 
be reported as  and 2) Hand Eczema Severity Index (HECSI)viii, a well- accepted and 
validated scoring system for disease activity . It incorporates both the extent and the 
intensity of the disease. Each hand is divided into five areas: fingertips, fingers (except the tips), palms, back of hands and wrists. Each area will be score for

 extension and intensity of the six following clinical signs: erythema, 
induration/ papulation, vesicles, fissuring, scaling and edema; which are graded on 
the following scale: 0, no skin changes; 1, mild disease; 2, moderate and 3, severe  
(see appendix) . Data will be reported as percent change in HECSI  score from 
baseline to week 4, 8 and 12 .  
The presence or absence of skin irritation (e.g. macular/papular eruption), redness, 
atrophy and telangiectasia will be noted at each study visit.  
- The pruritus  intensity will be assessed using Itch Numerical Rating Scale (NRS ; 
see appendix) . Data will be reported as proportion of participants with a ≥ 2 and 4-
point improvement in Itch Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score  from baseline to 
week 4, 8 and 12.  The NRS  comprised of one item and represents the numbers  0 
(“no itch”) to 10 (“worst imaginable itch”). Subjects are asked to rate the intensity of 
their itch using this  scale.  The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)  measured 
6 disease- specific domains (symptoms and feelings, leisure, daily activities, work 
and school, personal relationships, and treatment) during the last week; individual 
items were summed to generate an overall score.  Data will be reported as change 
from baseline to week 12 in DLQI. The Work P roductivity and Activity 
Impairment -Chronic Hand Dermatitis (WPAI -CHD) questionnaire elicited the 
number of work hours missed, hours worked, and impairment while 
working/performing usual daily activities as a result of chronic hand dermatitis 
during the past 7 days. The sum of work time missed and work impairment while 
work ing yielded the overall work impairment measure. All scores were expressed 
as percentages, with higher scores indicating greater impairmentix. Data will be 
reported as change from baseline to week 12 in work productivity and activity 
impairment index. Will also collect Skin Symptom Questionnaire routinely used by 
the URMC dermatology department  
- Digital pictures: A digital picture will be taken with a dedicated digital camera using 
the Haiku App. The pictures will be labeled with the subject’s study ID and date. 
Pictures will not include identifying information (e.g. facial features, tattoo, etc). 
Pictures will be taken at a distance for easy identification of the anatomical area and closer to better capture clinical changes. Digital photographs will be used to record the location and monitor the size of target lesions.   
- Venous blood sample:  blood will be obtained for safety lab  
- Skin barrier measurements:  Transepidermal water loss/ TEWL,  +/- pH will be 
obtained on treatment area at a perilesional site.   This measurement asses the 
dryness and health of the skin.  For each of the specific measurements, a probe will 
be gently applied on the skin surface for up to 1 minute. We will perform all measurements in a climate -controlled examination room with consistent 
temperature (~23℃ ) and humidity (~50%).   The patient must be very comfortable 
in the room in which they are being tested to ensure that perspiration due to stress

 or acclimatization does not alter the TEWL. TEWL will be assessed using a non-
invasive skin probe that measures skin hydration - or other similar device available 
in the CTU. The URMC department of Dermatology owns the devices and has 
experience with measurements. Stratum Corneum  (SC) integrity: the most 
superficial layers of the skin will be collected by tape stripping using D -squame (D -
squame®, CuDerm, Dallas TX, USA). This is a well -established method used in 
clinical research to gently perturb the skin barrier. The first tape will be discarded to eliminate dirt and remnants of skin products. Each tape will be gently pressed 
against the skin with standardized pressure for 5-10 seconds (sec) using a 
standardized pressurizer (D500–D- squame® pressure instrument, CuDerm )).  All 
subjects will have 20consecutive tapes collected from lesional skin as part of this 
study. TEWL will be measured after each set of 5 tape strippings. These 
measurements should provide data to determine if the treatment has an effect on skin barrier integrity. Dsquame tapes will be collected and stored in -80 C freezer 
(see below) .  Expression of relevant biomarkers can be investigated using RNA or 
protein eluted from the tapes. Dr . De Benedetto’s lab is familiar with the methods 
and analysis  
- Skin swab : will be collected at each visit. Briefly a sterile swab will be rolled on the 
dorsal hand (non- dominant hand) at each visit and stored at -80C for future analysis  
- Study Drug Diary: subjects will be provided  with a prepopulated dated calendar to 
record their twice daily  (AM and PM)  application of study medication as well as the 
time the medication is applied.  Also,  on this diary the subject can indicate if a 
missed dose occurred and there is a blank space they can write in the reason it was missed.  At the END of each day the subject will need to indicate on the same study 
diary their level of hand dermatitis itch throughout the day – 0=no itch and 10=worst 
imaginable itch. Subjects will indicate their level 0- 10 by circling the number that 
best applies to them for that particular d ate.  Detailed instructions are provided on

Prohibited Medications and procedures: use of topical or systemic 
immunosuppression/immunomodulators medications and Phototherapy is not permitted during the study. Hand surgery or other procedures (including but not limited to Cryotherapy, ED&C, skin biopsy) are disallowed during the study. If  medically necessary, 
the investigator will withdraw the patients from the study.  
 
5. RISK, BENEFITS and PROTECTION AGAINST RISKS  
Risks Associated with Digital Picture  
There are no known risks for the digital picture. The image will not include identifying features and will be labeled with study subject ID and date. Pictures will be taken with a 
dedicated camera, stored on a secure server.  Pictures will be taken through the Haiku 
App and stored in the patients EMR in Epic.

Risks Associated with Barrier Assessments There are no known risks for the barrier assessments . 
 Risks Associated with Tape Stripping  
The risks associated with tape stripping, theoretically, include the rare possibility of an allergic reaction to the tape and infection.  Since the tape is removed immediately after application, the risk of reaction is extremely low.  In previous and ongoing studies involving tape stripping, it has been noted that a very mild erythema may develop 
immediately after a series of tape strippings on one localized area of skin, presumably 
due to the mild mechanical disturbance.  The erythema is expected to resolv e within 12 
hours without sequelae.  The risk of skin infection is extremely low since only superficial skin layers are removed.  Subjects will be provided with wound care information and a 
department phone number to contact should they have any concerns.  
 
Risks o f Phlebotomy  
The risks of having blood drawn include some pain when the needle goes in, and a 
small risk of bruising and/or infection at that site. Some people will get lightheaded, nauseous, or faint. Approximately  3 teaspoons of blood will be drawn and is not likely to 
cause lightheadedness, however subjects will be observed after blood draw to be sure they are comfortable with ambulation.   Subjects will be encouraged to drink plenty of 
water prior to the blood draw. Phlebotomy will be performed at the antecubital fossa to minimize pain and bruising. Subjects will be seated during the blood draw to minimize dizziness and any risk of falling. Pressure will be applied to the site after the draw and a band- aid will be applied to minimize the risk of bleeding and infection.   Fasting 
laboratories will be processed at URMC local lab.  We require fasting laboratories as the 
lipid panel can be influenced by food intake and it is routine care to do fasting laboratories of at least 6 hours.  Due to known side effects of systemic class of 
medication we want to screen p atients  for leucopenia, high lipids, liver or kidney 
diseases; normal or non- clinical significant labs at baseline are useful to rule out these 
problems and can be helpful in case we have side effect s during the study . 
The clinical trial team will receive and review the laboratory results between 24- 48 
hours.  
 
 
 
Risks of Ruxolitinib 1.5% cream  
Skin-related side effects of ruxolitinib cream are rare, but have included local irritation, 
pain, itch, redness, acne, and rash. While other side effects are not expected and have 
not been seen in other studies of ruxolitinib cream, there is a potential r isk of side effects

 that have been observed with much higher doses of ruxolitinib when given by mouth. 
These risks include infection, low blood counts, liver inflammation, elevated cholesterol, dizziness, headache, fatigue, insomnia, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. As with any 
treatment, there is a small risk of an allergic reaction, though this has not been 
documented for ruxolitinib cream.  
There is a risk of no change or worsening of disease, as would be true with any change in treatment.  
 FDA approved medication label information, risks include:  
• Patients treated with oral JAK inhibitors for inflammatory conditions are at risk for 
developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death 
• Reported infections include:  
o Active tuberculosis (TB), which may present with pulmonary or 
extrapulmonary disease 
o Invasive fungal infections (eg, candidiasis, pneumocystosis)  
o Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens  
• Avoid use in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections  
• If a serious infection develops, interrupt therapy until infection is controlled 
• Do not resume until the infection is controlled.  
• Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment before initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection  
• Closely monitor for developing signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment  
 
Repro ductive Risks  
Women of childbearing  potential will be counseled to use acceptable birth control 
methods. Women will not be allowed to participate in this study if they are pregnant, 
become pregnant, or are nursing an infant.  
 General Risks 
When participating in any research study there is a possibility for invasion of privacy or breach of confidentiality. As with any research study, there may be additional risks that 
are unknown or unexpected.  The subjects are advised to contact their study team with any questions and/or concerns . At that time the study team will determine whether or 
not any untoward medical occurrence is associated with the study and/or study drug and will be recorded on the Medical History and/or Adverse Event page of the source document.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting An adverse event  (AE) is any observation whether or not considered to be product 
related, that is unfavorable and unintended and that occurs after any use of an investigational medicinal product.  
De Benedetto

 Any observation of abnormality will be documented on the Adverse event form.  The 
Investigator will document the date of occurrence, severity, resolution, and will assess the relationship of the adverse event to the study drug by assigning a causality assessment.
 
Results from laboratory evaluations which are outside of the laboratory reference range will constitute an adverse event only if the Investigator determines that the result is clinically significant.  
Severity will be assessed by the following system:  
• Mild: easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort  
• Moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with every day activities  
• Severe: prevents normal every day activities  
Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
FDA definition: A serious adverse event results in death, is life- threatening, requires 
inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent 
or significant disability / incapacity, results in a congenital anomaly / birth defect. Events 
fitting these descriptions will be considered adverse events if they occur after treatment 
with the study drug.  
As soon as reasonably possible, subjects will contact the Investigator to report any 
unfavorable events. The Investigator will assess the case, determine the need for 
treatment, and consult with Incyte, Inc, particularly in the occurrence of:  
• A serious adverse event.  
• An unusual frequency of non- serious adverse events.  
• Death, even if this does not appear to be related to therapy with the study 
drug.  
The Investigator will notify the URMC Institutional Review Board within approximately 3 
working days if a serious adverse event occurs.  
 
SAE Reporting to Incyte 
The Principal Investigator (PI) must report all Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) to Incyte 
within 24 hours of learning of an event, regardless of the PI’s causality assessment. This notification should be provided on a completed Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form. SAE reporting for each subject begins the day the informed consent is signed by the patient and within 30 days after subject has completed or discontinued from the study or has taken last dose of the study drug, or as described in the protocol.  
SAEs, occurring using Incyte study drug, are reported in accordance with the effective protocol. SAEs occurring with any other commercial drug are reported to the manufacturer of that drug in accordance with regulations and protocol.

14 
 Initial SAEs and/or subsequent follow -up reports should be reported via email to 
SafetyReporting@Incyte.com or fax (+) 1- 866-981-2057. SAE reports should be for a 
single subject. SAE forms should be sent with a cover sheet and any additional 
attachments.  
All adverse event information is reported to Incyte on the Principal Investigator’s/Institution’s Adverse Event Report Form, or a CIOMS -I or MedWatch Form 
FDA 3500A, or on an Adverse Event Report Form which may be provided by Incyte upon request. The Principal Investigator does not provide medical records (e.g., discharge summary) to Incyte, unless specifically requested.  
Reporting of Pregnancy to Incyte an “Initial Pregnancy Report” or equivalent must be 
completed in full and emailed to SafetyReporting@Incyte.com or faxed to (+) 1- 866-981-
2057 within 24 hours of discovery of a pregnancy of a subject who has taken the Incyte product or the pregnancy of a partner for a subject who has taken the Incyte product. The “Follow- up Pregnancy Report Form” or equivalent must be completed and emailed to 
SafetyReporting@Incyte.com or faxed to (+) 1- 866-981-2057 within 30 days after 
delivery, so that Incyte is provided with information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy results in any events that  meet the serious criteria (i.e., 
miscarriage or termination), the SAE reporting process needs to be followed and the timelines associated with a SAE should be followed.  
Causality assessments 
Probable  
              All of the following apply:  
• Reasonable association in time between the administration of the study drug 
and onset and duration of the reported event.  
• Description of the clinical phenomenon should be consistent with, or at least 
plausible, given the known pharmacology and toxicology of the product.  
• There should be no other equally plausible explanation(s) of the case. In 
particular, concurrent use of other products (and possible interactions) or 
concurrent disease should be taken into account in the assessment.  
Possible  
• The causality is one (of other) possible and plausible causes for the described 
event, but the data do not meet the criteria for inclusion in Category A.  
Unknown  
• An association with the study drug cannot be discounted, but other factors 
prevent a conclusion from being drawn.  
Unlikely  
• Sufficient information exists to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the 
product was not likely to be the cause of the event.

 Classification of adverse events  
At the conclusion of the study, Medicinal Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Authorities 
(MeDDRA) terms will be assigned to all adverse events and will be included in the final study report.  
Stopping Criteria  
If more than 5 patients report a greater than moderate local side effect (irritation, worsening of rash, vesicles/bulla etc) or if the clinical dermatological score in the treatment area as assessed by the clinician has worsened by more than 50% from basel ine in more than 5 patients, then all patients will stop medication until further review 
and changes made to the protocol.  If any unanticipated serious adverse effects are noted all subjects will be notified and changes will be made to future protocols and submitted for approval.

vs post evaluation will be analyzed for IGA scores by the Wilcoxon sign- rank test.    
 Data Storage and Confidentiality  
All data from the clinical trial will be securely stored using the REDCap.  Only the minimal necessary data is being collected.  This includes: name, contact information, age, sex, 
MRN, history of allergies, dermatologic diagnosis, history of other medical conditions, current medications and clinical scores. Subjects may be asked to sign an Authorization 
for Release/Disclosure of Medical Health Information form if a chart is not established at the University of Rochester.  Access to this protected health information will be restricted to the principal investigator, sub- investiga tor and study coordinators.   Information 
obtained will be stored in REDcap.  Samples will be assigned unique identifiers and stored 
separately from the key linking the sample to the identifiers.  The electronic key will be stored in REDcap file, accessible only to study personnel.  Any paper documents containing identifiers will be kept in a binder in a locked cabinet accessible only to study 
personnel.   
 Data Monitoring The study will be monitored in compliance with the relevant parts of 21 CFR and according to the ICH GCP Guidelines.  
Case Report Forms will be completed as information becomes available or within five days of a Study Visit.  
 
The Principal Investigator or a Sub- investigator will sign and date the indicated places of 
the Case Report Form.  This signature will indicate that thorough inspection of the data 
therein has been made and will thereby certify the contents of the form.   
 The procedures outlined in the protocol and case report forms will be carefully reviewed by the Sponsor, Investigator and staff prior to Study Initiation to ensure appropriate interpretation and implementation.  No deviations from the protocol shall be made except

 in emergency situations where alternative treatment is necessary for the protection, 
proper care and well -being of subjects.  
 Amendments will be submitted to the IRB for their review and approval prior to implementation.  When an amendment to a protocol substantially alters the study design or increases potential risk to the study subject, the Informed Consent form will be revise d 
and if applicable, subject’s consent to continue participation will again be obtained.  
 
7. SUBJECTS IDENTIFICATION, RECRUITMENT AND CONSENT  
Method of subject identification and recruitment  
Dr. Anna De Benedetto and study team will identify potential subjects  in URMC 
dermatology clinics , screening upcoming clinic schedules  in eRecord for potential 
eligible subjects  with a diagnosis of hand dermatitis as well as referrals from 
dermatologists within URMC dermatology clinics.  The study team may contact the potential eligible subjects via telephone call prior to their clinic visit to discuss the study, field questions and assess interest. If a patient is found to have a history of diagnosed 
hand dermatitis in which they have been treated at URMC dermatology, as well as a 
history of having been seen by Dr. Anna De Benedetto during a prior clinic visit, the potential subject may be contacted via URMC MyChart.  If the potential subject is 
interested in participating in the study they will be offered to have the consent form mailed or emailed to them to READ ONLY with instructions that the consent is for review only.  Prior to the consent being mailed or emailed to the potential subject a study team member will cross out the signature page to eliminate confusion.  The 
potential participant will sign a NEW clean consent upon their clinic and/or study visit 
along with the study team member.  
In the case of clinical subjects, Dr. De Benedetto or other URMC faculties will provide the subject with a contact phone number for the study coordinator who is approved to enroll and consent subjects. While Dr. De Benedetto will be available for questions, consent might be obtained by other study personnel for subjects she sees in her clinical practice. It will be made clear to the potential subjects that their participation is voluntary and their care at the Department of Dermatology will not be affected by their decision to participate in this study.
  
 
Process of consent  
Dr. De Benedetto or other team members (e.g.  coordinator, nurse, co- investigator) will 
meet directly with the subjects in a private suite. The consent form will be discussed with the potential subject. Time allotted to consenting will be dependent on the subjects’ needs, questions, and comprehension of the information in the consent form.  Each 
subject will be encouraged to read the consent form on his/her own and ask any specific questions  as well as have the option to take the consent home to review with family 
and/or friends.  
Subjects will be given a copy of the signed consent.

Subject capacity  
We will not be recruiting subject incapable of giving informed consent . 
Subject/representative comprehension  
The subject’s capacity to comprehend the information in the consent form will be assessed by asking questions about the content and encouraging the subject to describe 
briefly the study procedures.  
Documentation of consent  
The consent will be documented by signing and dating the consent form by both the study 
subject and the person obtaining consent. A copy of the consent form will be provided to the subject.  
Costs to the subject  
Procedures performed during the study will be at no cost to the subject.  
 Payment for participation 
 
Subjects that agree to participate in the study will receive compensation for their time:  $35.00 for the screening visit.  Each complete study visit will be $50.00. For a total of up to $285.00 including if all visits are completed.   
 For this study we use a subject payment system called Advarra Participant Payments. 
The system allows three ways to provide payment. Subjects  can choose: a reloadable 
debit card; direct deposit; or mailed paper checks. The study team will help subject  
create a “subject profile” in the system.  In order to provide payment, the subject  will 
need to enter their name and date of birth into their subject profile which is required to 
set up a subject account and for customer service purposes.   Depending on which 
payment method is chosen , the subject  may also need to enter their email address and 
banking information.  If the subject  already has an Advarra account (because they are in 
another study that uses this system), their existing profile will be used to provide 
payment.    
Payment s received for participation in research is considered taxable income.  If the 
subject  receives $600.00 or more in any one calendar year from UR or its affiliates, the 
University is required to report this information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 
a 1099 (Miscellaneous Income) form.  The subject  will be sent a copy of this form and a 
copy will be sent to the IRS. Depending on the amount the subject is  paid, they may be 
asked to submit a W -9 form, which includes their Social Security Number.  
 Potential benefits to the subjects  
There are no benefits for the individual participant. The investigational medication may temporally improve or worsen the lesion in the target area of application. The nature of this pilot study does not promise benefit for the individual. We hope that thi s research will

PROTOCOL TITLE A Phase 3 Open -label, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Long -term Safety 
and Tolerability of LIQ861 (Treprostinil) in Pulmonary Arterial 
Hypertension WHO Group 1 (PAH) Patients  
PROTOCOL NUMBER  LTI-301 
INVESTIGATIONAL 
PRODUCT  LIQ861 at capsule strengths of 25 µg, 50 µg, 75 µg and 100 µg treprostinil.  
LIQ861 will be administered using the RS00 Model 8 dry powder 
inhalation (DPI) device (Plastiape S.p.A.; Osnago, Italy)  at dose levels of 
25 µg to 150 µg treprostinil QID in individual patients.  D osing at levels 
above 150 µg treprostinil QID will require authorization from the Sponsor . 
STUDY OBJECTIVES  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long -term safety and 
tolerability of LIQ861 in patients with PAH.  
The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the comparative 
bioavailability of treprostinil between two formulations of inhaled therapy . 
STUDY DESIGN & 
DURATION Study LTI -301 is a Phase 3 open- label, multicenter study in patient s with 
PAH to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of LIQ861.  
The study will evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of LIQ861 in 
PAH patient s who have been on stable doses of Tyvaso® for at least 3 
months (“ Tyvaso Transition ”), or who are taking no more than 2 approved 
non-prostacyclin oral PAH therapies (“LIQ861 Add -on”).   
A subset of patients will be enrolled in a one -directional crossover to 
compare bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of treprostinil as they 
transition from Tyvaso to LIQ861.   
At least 100 PAH patient s will be enrolled in the study to evaluate the 
long- term safety and tolerability of LIQ861.     
Dose titration schedules  for Tyvaso Transition  and LIQ861 Add -on 
patient s are described in Appendix 2.   
All patient s will be treated on an outpatient basis until regulatory approval 
of LIQ861.   
Scheduled study visits to the clinic will occur at Screening, Baseline (Day 
1), Week 2, Month 1, Month 2,  Month 4, and every 4 months thereafter 
(Month 8, Month 12, etc.) .  Beginning with Month 6, patients  will be called 
to assess safety  and LIQ861 tolerance every 4 months (Month 6, Month 10, 
etc.)  During this time, dose titration may be ordered at the Investigator’s 
discretion and in accordance with the guidance provided in Appendix 2 .       
Sub- Study - Comparative Bioavailability Assessment  
At least 18 PAH patient s on Tyvaso  will participate in  a comparative 
bioavailability sub -study (“PK sub- study”)  comparing treprostinil 
exposure in a one-directional  crossover design that utilizes the patient ’s 
prescribed Tyvaso dose as the comparator to LIQ861.  A stable dose of 
Tyvaso is defined as remaining  on one  dose administered  QID for at least 
3 months.  
Liquidia Technologies, Inc.   
Protocol LTI -301  Amendment 3 ( 20-Mar-19) 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 of 67 SYNOPSIS  
The d ose titration schedule for Tyvaso Transition  patient s is described in 
Appendix 2.   
Patients participating in this sub -study will have a trough level PK blood 
sample collected prior to self -administering their Tyvaso dose at the 
Investigational site at Baseline (morning dose Day 1) , under the 
supervision of study staff.  Following administration of Tyvaso, blood will 
be collected for PK analysis of treprostinil through 4 hours post -dose and 
the patients will remain in the clinic for safety observations per Investigator 
discretion .  After the 4 hour post -dose blood draw, the patient s will be 
transitioned to LIQ861 for subsequent doses of treprostinil  in accordance  
with their typical dosing regimen.  If the initial LIQ861 dose (based on the 
instructions in Appendix 2 ) is tolerated, patients will take two more doses 
of LIQ861, 4 hours apart, during Day 1.   If the initial LIQ861 dose is not 
tolerated, dose adjustments may be made as needed  during the next two 
doses taken on Day 1.   
On the morning of  Day 2, patients will have a trough level PK blood sample 
collected prior to self -administering their LIQ861 dose at the 
Investigational site , under the supervision of study staff.  This dose should 
be the same as the last tolerated dose taken on Day 1.  Following 
administration of LI Q861, blood will be collected for PK analysis of 
treprostinil through 4 hours post -dose.  After the final PK blood collection 
on Day 2, patient s will continue in the s tudy, with QID dosing of LIQ861,  
following the procedures and visit schedule for all othe r study patients . 
NUMBER OF 
SUBJECTS  A minimum of 100 patients will be enrolled and observed to support 
evaluation of safety and tolerance for LIQ861 use.  Patients will continue 
to receive LIQ861 and t he study will continue until LIQ861 is 
commercially available or the study is terminated by the Sponsor .  Patients 
may withdraw from study participation at any time and the patient’s 
physician may request withdrawal for medical or safety reasons at any 
time. 
The PK sub-study will contain at least 18 patient s with full PK profiles for 
each formulation of inhaled treprostinil , all of whom  will continue in the 
study upon completion of Day 2 PK collections . 
NUMBER OF SITES  Up to 50 sites

SAFETY ANALYSES  The primary endpoint will be the i ncidence of treatment -emergent Adverse 
Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) grouped by MedDRA 
System Organ Class, dose level, time on drug, and relationship to dose 
titration . 
Safety endpoints are as follows:  
• Incidence of treatment -emergent drug/device -related adverse 
events  
• Changes from Baseline to Month 2/Early Termination in clinical 
laboratory, physical exam findings, and vital signs.  
EXPLORATORY 
ANALYSES  For all patient s: 
• Change from Baseline to Week 2 and Months 1, 2, 4 and every 4 
months thereafter in 6MWD  
• Change from Baseline to Week 2 and Months 1, 2, 4 and every 4 
months  thereafter in NYHA Functional Class status  
• Change from Baseline to Week 2 and Months 1, 2, 4 and every 4 
months thereafter in NT -proBNP levels  
• Change from Baseline to Month 2, Month 4, and every 12 months 
thereafter in the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure  Quality of 
Life Questionnaire  
• Time to and reason for discontinuation of LIQ861 
For transitioning from Tyvaso only:  
• Proportion of patients maintaining a sustained treatment transition 
through the end of Month 2.  Sustained treatment transition is 
defined as meeting all of the following conditions:  1) current 
treatment with LIQ861 through at least 2 months beyond transi tion 
from Tyvaso, 2) no interruptions to study treatment totaling more 
than 7 days prior to the end of Month 2, and 3) no treatment with 
any prostacyclin or prostacyclin analogs apart from administration 
of LIQ861.  
• Comparison of LIQ 861 dose achieved at su stained treatment  to 
previous Tyvaso dose  
• Patient satisfaction with the LIQ861 DPI compared to the 
inhalation device from which they are transitioning using a simple 
questionnaire assessing device preference ( Appendix 5 ). 
PHARMACOKINETIC 
ANALYSES  For patient s in the PK sub- study only:  
• Individual pharmacokinetic parameters for treprostinil will be 
summarized by treatment using descriptive statistics.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters such as the maximum observed 
plasma concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (Tmax), the area 
under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time 0 
(predose) to time infinity (AUCinf), AUC from time 0 to time of 
last measurable  plasma concentration (AUClast), the percentage of 
Liquidia Technologies, Inc.   
Protocol LTI -301  Amendment 3 ( 20-Mar-19) 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 11 of 67 SYNOPSIS  
AUC that is extrapolated beyond the last measurable  concentration 
(AUCext), the terminal phase rate constant (λz), the apparent 
systemic clearance (CL/ F), the apparent volume of distribution in 
the terminal phase (Vz/F), mean residence time (MRT), and the 
terminal phase half -life (t½) will be calculated using non -
compartmental analyses.  
• An assessment of comparative bioavailability of treprostinil will 
also be made between LIQ861 and Tyvaso based on dose -
normalized AUCinf calculations for the two treatments.  
STATISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  • Individual and mean plots of plasma concentrations versus time 
after administration of treprostinil will be constructed an d 
displayed for relevant treatment comparisons.  
• Plasma concentrations will be summarized by treatment using 
descriptive statistics (sample size, mean, median, coefficient of 
variation [CV%], standard deviation [SD], minimum, and 
maximum).  Corresponding by- patient  data listings will be 
tabulated.  
• Derived plasma PK parameters will be summarized by treatment 
using descriptive statistics (sample size, arithmetic and geometric 
mean, CV%, SD of the arithmetic mean, median, minimum, and 
maximum).   
• The number and percentage of patient s who experience at least 1 
AE will be presented by severity, relationship to study drug, 
MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC), preferred term, and dose 
level of one or both drugs administered.  Clinically significant vital 
signs findings and changes from Baseline values will be t abulated 
and summarized.  Clinical laboratory results will be tabulated.

1.1. Background & Rationale for LIQ861 Development  
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a complex, multifactorial, progressive, and life -
threatening disease characterized by proliferative and obstructive changes in the pulmonary 
vasculature and involving numerous biochemical pathways and cell types.  The disease is 
chara cterized by elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and right ventricular failure that carries a 
poor prognosis associated with significant morbidity and mortality, having a historical survival 
rate of less than five years.  Endothelial dysfunction is thought  to occur early on, leading to cell 
proliferation and structural changes in the pulmonary vasculature that lead to increased pulmonary 
arterial pressure (PAP) and resultant right ventricular enlargement and dysfunction.  In addition, 
endothelial dysfunctio n results in chronically impaired production of vasoactive mediators, such 
as nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin, along with prolonged overexpression of vasoconstrictors, 
such as endothelin- 1 (Channick, Vosw inckel et al. 2012 ). 
PAH is part of a larger classification for pulmonary hypertension, which is divided into five groups  
based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (designated as WHO Groups 1 through 5) , 
as defined at the 5th World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension in Nice, France  (Simonneau, 
Gatzoulis et al. 2013) .  PAH is used to describe exclusively WHO Group 1.  Pulmonary 
hypertension (PH)  is used to describe the remaining four groups (WHO Groups 2- 5) and also when 
referring to all 5 groups collectively.   
• WHO Group 1 -  PAH: Pulmonary arterial hypertension.   
• WHO Group 2 -  PH: Pulmonary hypertension secondary to l eft heart disease.  
• WHO Group 3 -  PH: Pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung diseases or hypoxemia.  
• WHO Group 4 -  PH: Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.   
• WHO Group 5 -  PH: Pulmonary hypertension with unknown mechanisms.  
PAH initially presents  as exertional dyspnea, lethargy, and fatigue and is often confused for other 
disease states.  As PAH progresses and right ventricular failure develops, exertional chest pain 
(i.e., angina), exertional syncope, and peripheral edema may develop.  Following confirmation of 
diagnosis based on hemodynamic parameters, treatment is recommended to lower pulmonary 
pressures and treat the symptoms of PAH.  Although no cure exists for PAH, treatment of PAH is 
directed at improving hemodynamic measures  (Badesch, Abman et al. 2007) , New York Heart 
Association (NYHA) functional class  (Miller -Davis, Marden et al. 2006) , the six -minute walk 
distance (6MWD)  (Babu, Padmakumar et al. 2016 ), quality of life  (QOL)  (Babu, Padmakumar et 
al. 2016) , and, in some studies, survival .  
The severity of PAH may be classified according to the NYHA heart failure guidelines as follows:  
• NYHA Class I:  Patients with  cardiac disease having  no limitation of activities; ordin ary 
physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain. 
• NYHA Class II:  Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity; 
they are comfortable at  rest, however ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, 
dyspnea, or anginal pain.  
Liquidia Technologies, Inc.   
Protocol LTI -301  Amendment 3 ( 20-Mar-19) 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 18 of 67 • NYHA Class III:  Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of activity; they 
are comfortable at rest , however less than ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, 
palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.  
• NYHA Class IV:  Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical 
activity without discomfort.  Symptoms of heart failure or the anginal syndrome may be present 
even at rest with discomfort increasing if any physical activity is undertaken.  
Treprostinil is a chemically stable tricyclic benzidine prostanoid with vasodilator properties that is 
capable of reducing pulmonary vasoconstriction with minimal effects on systemic blood pressure 
(Channick, Voswinckel et al. 2012) .  Treprostinil has been approved for the treatment of PAH and 
is marketed by the United Therapeutics Corporation under the trade names Orenitram® (extended 
release oral tablets) , Remodulin® (subcutaneous or IV infusion)  and Tyvaso (inhaled via 
ultrasonic, pulsed delivery device).  Tyvaso was shown to be effective in the treatment of PAH , 
with an advantage of the inhaled route of administration being  that it brings the drug very near the 
desired site of action (pulmonary arteries in the lungs)  (McLaughlin, Benza et al. 2010) . 
One of the greatest impediments  to patient treatment satisfaction with Tyvaso is inconvenience.  
Currently, patients on Tyvaso may require more than  36 breaths per day with the use of a bulky 
nebulizer.  The use of a discrete , hand- held dry powder inhaler to deliver treprostinil to the lungs 
would represent a major improvement in convenience and patient satisfaction, thereby improving 
the quality of life for PAH patients.  Thus, Liquidia is pursuing approval of LIQ861, an inhalation 
dry powder formulation of treprostinil that is produced using Liquidia’s PRINT® Technology 
(Particle Replication in Nonwetting Templates), as an alternative to Tyvaso for the treatment of 
patients with PAH (WHO Group 1).  
1.2. Description of LIQ861  
LIQ861 is a capsule containing a dry powder mixture of treprostinil  and excipients (bulk powder) 
designed for inhalation using a dry powder inhalation device.  The bulk powder is generated from 
a treprostinil/excipient matrix from which particles of precise size (1 µm) and shape (“pollen -
shaped”) are created and filled in to a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) capsule (size 3).  
LIQ861 capsules are provided in capsule strengths of 25 µg, 50 µg, 75 µg and 100 µg treprostinil.   
The LIQ861 capsule is intended for use with a handheld monodose  dry powder inhalation device.  
The device chosen for clinical trials is the RS0 0 Model 8 manufactured by Plastiape.  The overall 
design of the RS00 Model 8 device is shown in Figure 1.  
Figure 1.  RS00 Model 8 Dry Powder Inhalation Device  
 
The mouthpiece contains a mesh that aids in particle size reduction and prevents capsule ingestion 
during inhalation.  The inhaler body component contains 2 side buttons, each housing 4 pins for 
piercing a capsule.   A capsule piercing area is located internally, adjacent to the pins.  When a 

Liquidia Technologies, Inc.   
Protocol LTI -301  Amendment 3 ( 20-Mar-19) 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of 67 capsule is inserted in this area, depressing the buttons causes the button pins to pierce the capsule 
ends, thereby preparing the capsule for emptying.  Above the capsule piercing area, there are 2 
tangential air inlets and a circular chamber.  These allow  the capsule to spin when the patient  
inhales through the device.  Capsule spinning creates a centrifugal effect on the powder that 
promotes efficient emptying.  Emitted doses from each capsule are less than the labeled capsule 
strengths of treprostinil, w hich correspond to the amount of powder with which each capsule is 
filled.   
1.3. Development Program  
A first -in-human study was performed at the PPD Phase 1 Clinic  in Austin, TX under a US 
Investigational New Drug ( IND).  Study LTI -101 was a Phase 1, single -center, placebo -controlled, 
double -blinded, randomized study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the LIQ861 formulation 
and to characterize the pharmacokinetics ( PK) of treprostinil as an inhaled dry powder .  Cohorts 
of 8 healthy volunteers  were rando mly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single dose of either 
LIQ861 (n = 6) or placebo (n = 2) at dose level s of 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 µg treprostinil.  
Blood for measurement of treprostinil concentrations was collected through 8 hours post -dose for 
determination of treprostinil noncompartmental PK parameters.   
The median treprostinil Tmax was between 10 and 20 minutes post -dose administration .  Dose 
proportionality was assessed based on Cmax and AUCinf and concluded to be proportional over 
the entire tested dose range of 25 to 150 µg  treprostinil.  The LIQ861 formulation was found to be 
well-tolerated after single- dose administration with no serious or unexpected adverse events.  The 
most commonly reported related adverse events  (AEs)  were cough, throat irritation, inspiratory 
tightness, lightheadedness, and headache; all were described as mild in severity.   There were no 
serious AEs.  
Additional information on the development of the LIQ861 product may be found in the most 
current versi on of the Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.4. Rationale for the Current Study  
Study LTI -301 is a Phase 3 open -label, multicenter study in patient s with PAH to evaluate the 
long-term safety and tolerability of LIQ861 and the comparative bioavailability in patient s 
transitioning from Tyvaso to LIQ861.  
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of LIQ861 
in patients with PAH.  
The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the comparative bioavailabilit y of treprostinil 
between two formulations of inhaled therapy  
3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan 
Study LTI -301 is a Phase 3 open -label, multicenter study in patient s with PAH to evaluate the 
long-term safety and tolerability of LIQ861.  
Liquidia Technologies, Inc.   
Protocol LTI -301  Amendment 3 ( 20-Mar-19) 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 67 The study  will evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of LIQ861 in PAH patient s who have 
been on stable doses o f Tyvaso  (treprostinil) inhalation solution  for at  least 3 months (“ Tyvaso 
Transition ”), or who are taking  no more than 2 approved non -prostacyclin oral PAH therapies  
(“LIQ861 Add- on”).   
A subset of patients will be enrolled in a one -directional crossover to compare the bioavailability 
and pharmacokinetics of treprostinil as they transition from Tyvaso to LIQ 861.   
Figure 2.  Schematic of LTI -301 Study Design  
 
At least 100  PAH patient s will be enrolled in the study  to evaluate the long -term safety and 
tolerability of LIQ861.  All patients will be treated on an outpatient basis until regulatory approval 
of LIQ861.   
Tyvaso Transition patient s will receive training on the use of the dry powder inhalation (DPI) 
device and then administer their first  dose of LIQ861 at the Investiga tional site at the Baseline 
Visit (Day 1) under the supervision of study staff  and will remain in the clinic for safety per 
Investigator discretion.  The initial LIQ861 treprostinil dose will be matched to the comparable  
prescribed Tyvaso dose  at transition  (Appendix 2) ; subsequently, LIQ861 will be maintained on a 
QID dosing schedule for the duration of the study .  During this time, dose titration may be ordered 
at the Investigator’s discretion and in accordance with the Guidance for LIQ861 Dose Selection 
and Titration ( Appendix 2) . 
Add-on patient s will receiv e training on the use of the DPI  and then administer their first dose of 
LIQ861 at the Investigational site at Baseline (Day 1) under the supervision of study staff.  Study 
drug wil l be administered for LIQ861 Add -on patient s initially at 25μg treprostinil in LIQ861 QID 
with timing of  dose titrations chosen at  the Investigator ’s discretion while maintaining a QID 
dosing schedule  (Appendix 2) .  Alterations to the dosing interval (e.g., 3 times a day or 5 times a 
day) must be approved by the Sponsor.  
Scheduled study visits to the clinic will occur at Screening, Baseline (Day 1),  Week 2, Month 1, 
Month 2, Month 4, and every 4 months thereafter  (e.g., Month 8, Month 12, etc.)  until study 
termination or regulatory approval .  During this time, dose titration may be ordered at the 
Investigator’s discretion and in accordance with the Guidance for LIQ861 Dose Selection and 
Titration ( Appendix 2) .

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 of 67 Telephone contact to assess adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, and PAH symptoms 
will be made every 4 months beginning at Month 6 (e.g., Month 6, Month 10, etc.) until the Study 
Termination Visit.  Telephone contact is not necessary during months in which a study visit is 
scheduled.  The Study Termination Visit will occur after regulatory approval  of LIQ861 or after 
the Sponsor decides to terminate the development program .   
Patient s that clinically worsen on open -label LIQ861, as determined by  Investigator’s discretion 
may be withdrawn from the study and rescue therapy initiated per standard of care.   
Sub-Study -  Comparative Bioavailability Assessment  
At least 18 PAH patient s on Tyvaso (s table doses QID for at least 3 months ) will be included in a 
comparative bioavailability sub -study (“PK sub- study”) comparing treprostinil exposure in a one -
directional  crossover design that utilizes the patient ’s prescribed Tyvaso dose as the comparator t o 
LIQ861.   
The d ose titration schedule for these patient s is described in Appendix 2.   
Patients participating in this sub -study will have a trough level PK blood sample collected prior to 
self-administering their Tyvaso dose at the Investigational site at Baseline (morning dose  Day 1) , 
under the supervision of study staff.  Following administration of Tyvaso, blood will be collected 
for PK analysis of treprostinil through 4 hours post -dose and the patients will remain in the clinic 
for safety observations per Investigator discre tion.  After the 4 hour post -dose blood draw, the 
patients will be transitioned to LIQ861 for subsequent doses of treprostinil in accordance with their 
typical dosing regimen.  If the initial LIQ861 dose (based on the instructions in Appendix 2) is 
tolerated, patients will take two more doses of LIQ861, 4 hours apart, during Day 1.  If the initial 
LIQ861 dose is not tolerated, dose adjustments may be made as needed during the next two doses 
taken on Day 1.  
On the morning of Day 2, patients will have a trough level PK blood sample collected prior to self -
administering their LIQ861 dose at the Investigational site , under the supervision of  study staff.  
This dose should be the same as the last tolerated dose taken on Day 1.  Following administration 
of LIQ861, blood will be collected for PK analysis of treprostinil through 4 hours post -dose.  After 
the final PK blood collection on Day 2, patients will continue in the study , with QID dosing of 
LIQ861, following the procedures and visit schedule for all other study patients.  
3.2. Endpoints  
3.2.1. Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint will be the i ncidence of T reatment -Emergent Adv erse Events ( TEAEs) and 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) grouped by MedDRA System Organ Class , dose level, time on 
drug, and relationship to dose titration. 
3.2.2. Safety Endpoints  
Safety endpoints are as follows:

Protocol LTI -301  Amendment 3 ( 20-Mar-19) 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 67 3.2.3. Pharmacokinetic Endpoints  
For patient s in the PK sub- study only:  
• Individual pharmacokinetic parameters for treprostinil will be summarized by treatment 
using descriptive statistics.  Pharmacokinetic parameters such as the maximum observed 
plasma concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (Tmax), the area under the plasma 
concentration versus time curve f rom time 0 (predose) to time infinity (AUCinf), AUC 
from time 0 to time of last measurable plasma concentration (AUClast), the percentage of 
AUC that is extrapolated beyond the last measurable concentration (AUCext), the terminal 
phase rate constant (λz), the apparent systemic clearance (CL/F), the apparent volume of 
distribution in the terminal phase (Vz/F), mean residence time (MRT), and the terminal 
phase half -life (t½) will be calculated using non -compartmental analyses.  
• An assessment of comparative bio availability of treprostinil will also be made between 
LIQ861 and Tyvaso based on dose -normalized AUCinf calculations for the two treatments.  
3.2.4. Exploratory Endpoints  
For all patients:  
• Change from Baseline to Week 2 and Months 1, 2, 4 and every 4 months there after in 
6MWD  
• Change from Baseline to Week 2 and Months 1, 2, 4 and every 4 months thereafter in 
NYHA Functional Class status  
• Change from Baseline to Week 2 and Months 1, 2, 4 and every 4 months thereafter in NT -
proBNP levels  
• Change from Baseline to Month 2, Month 4,  and every 12 months thereafter in the 
Minnesota Living with Heart Failure  (MLWHF)  Quality of Life Questionnaire  
• Time to and reason for discontinuation of LIQ861  
For transitioning from Tyvaso only:  
• Proportion of patients maintaining a sustained treatment transition through the end of 
Month 2.  Sustained treatment transition is defined as meeting the following conditions: 1) 
current treatment with LIQ861 through at least 2 months beyond transition from Tyvaso, 
2) no interruptions to stud y treatment totaling more than 7 days prior to the end of Month 
2, and 3) no treatment with any prostacyclin or prostacyclin analogs apart from 
administration of LIQ861.  
• Comparison of LIQ861 dose achieved at sustained treatment to previous Tyvaso dose  
• Patient satisfaction with the LIQ861 DPI compared to the inhalation device from which 
they are transitioning from using a simple questionnaire to assess device preference  
(Appendix  5).

4.3. Removal of Patient s from Therapy/Premature Discontinuation  
Patient s will be encouraged to complete the study and all assessments.  A patient  will be 
discontinued from the study for the following medical or administrative reasons: 
• Occurrence of a TEAE that represents an unacceptable risk to the patient  and when 
continued participation in the investigational study is not warranted, in judgment of the 
Investigator.  The Investigator must follow the patient  until the AE resolves or 
satisfactorily stabilizes  
• Patient  request  
• Pregnancy

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 67 • Significant non- compliance with study procedures  or dosing regimen  
The Investigator may discontinue individual patient s from the study at any time.  Patient s may 
voluntarily withdraw at any time.   
All patient s withdrawn from the study because of a TEAE will continue to be followed for at least 
4 months after removal from LIQ861 treatment or until the adverse event(s) resolves or stabilizes  
(Section 6.2.7) . 
The Investigator will be responsible for obtaining final clinical assessments on patient s that early 
terminate from the study.  If a patient  is discontinued or withdraws from the study after receiving 
at least one dose of LIQ861  and withdraws/terminates prior to completion of the final assessments, 
then the site will make every effort to conduct a Study  Termination V isit.  
Unscheduled visits may be  conducted at the Investigator’s discretion for patient safety monitoring, 
following up on TEAEs/SAEs, or other reasons that will be documented.  Assessments at 
unscheduled visits will be symptom driven and conducted at the Investigator’s discretion.    
5. TREATMENTS  
5.1. Treatments Administered  
LIQ861 will be self -administered by  the patient s in the study after receiving adequate training by 
qualified study staff .  LIQ861 administration must occur  only in accordance with the procedures 
described in this protocol  and detailed instructions that are supplied for distribution to the study 
patient s. 
5.2. Identity of Investigational Product(s)  
LIQ861 is a capsule containing a pre -loaded amount of a white to off- white dry powder containing 
treprostinil and excipients (bulk powder), which is intended to be inhaled with the use of the RS00 
Model 8 DPI (Figure 1).  The bulk powder , which is manufactured by Liquidia Technologies , 
consists of particles of precise size (1 µm) and shape (“pollen -shaped”) that are created from a 
treprostinil/excipient matrix using Liquidia’s PRINT Technology.   
5.2.1. LIQ861  
The LIQ861 formulation is comprised of treprostinil sodium (drug substance salt) and five 
excipients: trehalose dihydrate, Polysorbate 80, leucine, sodium citrate, and sodium chloride.  The 
mass proportion of the excipients in the pollen- shaped particles greatly exceeds the strength of  
treprostinil in the mixture  (See Investigator’s Brochure) .  As such, the fill weights of bulk powder 
are much greater than the dosage strength of active drug substance.  Four capsule strengths of 
LIQ861 have been manufactured for this study:  
• The 25 μg tre prostinil capsule strength is a capsule that is filled with 5 mg LIQ861 bulk 
powder.  
• The 50 μg treprostinil capsule strength is a capsule that is filled with 10  mg LIQ861 
bulk powder.  
• The 75 μg treprostinil capsule strength is a capsule that is filled with 15  mg LIQ861 
bulk powder.  
Liquidia Technologies, Inc.   
Protocol LTI -301  Amendment 3 ( 20-Mar-19) 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 of 67 • The 100 μg treprostinil capsule strength is a capsule that is filled with 20 mg LIQ861 
bulk powder.  
For dose levels in excess of 100 μg treprostinil, multiple capsules of lower capsule strength may 
be used in immediate succession to achieve the desired dose of treprostinil.  A dose level of 125 µg 
should be delivered with a combination of a 75 µg and a 50 µg capsule, and a dose level of 150 µg 
should be delivered with a combination of two 75 µg capsules . 
5.2.2. Labeling  
Study drug will bear a label that meets applicable laws for an investigational drug, which may 
include, but is not limited to, the following information:  
• Federal law statement  
• Lot number  
• Box number   
• Storage information  
• Capsule Stren gth 
• Expiration date  
• Name of Sponsor  
5.2.3. Storage and Handling  
All study drug will be kept in a locked area with limited access and stored at 15°- 30°C ( 59°-86°F).   
When in the possession of patients, all study drug should be stored in a cool, dry area.  Study drug 
is packaged, per strength, as  four capsules per bottle , with eight bottles and two DPIs per box.   
5.3. Selection of Doses in the Study  
The results of study LT I-101 showed that the observed exposures of treprostinil after inhalation of 
LIQ861 are proportional to administered dose levels consistent with the capsule strengths selected 
for this study.  Mean Cmax and AUCinf values from the LTI -101 study were compare d with mean 
exposure levels reported in published literature and in the Drug Approval Reviews from the FDA.  
Commonalities between the exposures observed in the LTI -101 study and those reported for 
Tyvaso were used to project a Tyvaso Approximate Dose (TAD ) for LIQ861 .  This assessment 
was the basis of the original dose selection guidance (LTI -301 Protocol Amendment 1, 13- Nov-
2017) .   
Review of interim PK data from crossover patients in LTI -301 has shown that the initial TAD for 
LIQ861 may be providing lowe r plasma exposure than originally projected. The estimated 
treprostinil doses delivered from Tyvaso appear to result in plasma exposures that are more 
consistent with the estimated emitted  doses from  LIQ861.  The trend of observed plasma exposures 
from wit hin-patient PK comparisons in interim LTI -301 data review , combined with estimates of 
expected emitted doses from LIQ861 administration, are the basis of revised initial transition dose 
selection guidance provided in Table 2 and the directed dose administrations  for future PK patients 
provided in Table 3 (see Appendix 2).     
If the patient  is not already on Tyvaso , the starting dose will be LIQ861 QID at the 25 µg 
treprostinil capsule strength.  For patient s transitioning from Tyvaso, patient s should start at doses 
recommended in the Guidance for LIQ861 Dose Selection and Titration, Appendix 2.  For all 
patient s, dosing may be titrated per instructions provided in Appendix 2.

Protocol LTI -301  Amendment 3 ( 20-Mar-19) 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 67 5.4. Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient  
Patient s will receive QID administration of study drug on an outpatient basis  until regulatory 
approval of LIQ861 for the treatment of PAH  or until the sponsor decides to amend or terminate 
the study . 
5.5. Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Medications taken withi n 3 months  of screening will be documented in the patient ’s notes and 
electronic case report form (eCRF ).  
Any new or changed concomitant medication (prescriptions and non -prescriptions) , including PGI 
use, will be recorded in the source documents and eCRF  throughout the study , including any 
medication taken between the Screening Visit and initiation of treatment with LIQ861 .  
5.6. Prohibited Therapy  
Patient s may not be treated with LIQ861 if concurrently receiving any  of the following 
medications: 
• CYP2C8 inhibitors  and inducers , listed in Appendix 3  
• Oral administered prostacyclin analogues and agonists, such as treprostinil and selexipag 
5.7. Dose Modification  
When dosing is to exceed 100 μg treprostinil, administration  of LIQ861 capsules  should be 
administered as follows to achieve the target dose:  
To achieve a target dose of 125 µg treprostinil, the subject should administer  one 50 μg  treprostinil 
capsule followed by one 75 μg  treprostinil capsule . 
To achieve a target dose of 150 µg trepros tinil, the subject should administer  one 75 μg  treprostinil 
capsule followed by another 75 μg  treprostinil capsule . 
Based on data from the LTI -101 study, dose levels of up to 150 μg treprostinil in LIQ861 are well -
tolerated.  Authorization from the Sponsor is required prior to dosing at levels above 150 μg 
treprostinil. 
5.8. Treatment Compliance  
Patient s will self -administer the study drug at home.  At each visit, the patient  will receive a 
sufficient and documented quantity of capsules intended to last through the next visit.  Patient s 
should be instructed to return unused study medication at each study  visit for product 
accountability.  Sealed investigational product may be re -dispensed to the same patient .  Any other 
returned study medication should be retained for product accountability.   
5.8.1. Study Drug Accountability  
All study drug will be administered in accordance with the conditions of this protocol.  Only 
authorized site personnel may supply or dispense  study drug.  In rare instances, a courier may be 
used to retrieve drug from a study site and deliver it to a patient.  Study drug orders, records of 
study drug receipt, dispensing, and running inventory will be examined and reconciled throughout 
the study.  Only patient s enrolled in the study may receive study drug, in accordance with all 
applicable regulatory requirements.  Upon the completion of the study, study drug will be

instructions are communicated by Liquidia  or designee.  
6.5. Clinical Laboratory Tests   
All routine samples will be analyzed by a licensed clinical laboratory.  The clinical laboratory tests 
are as follows:  
• Hematology/Coagulation : hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count with differential, 
and red blood cell count  
• Blood Chemistry :  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT; SGPT) and Aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST; SGOT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, sodium, 
potassium, magnesium,  calcium, chloride, and uric acid .  
• Biomarkers :  NT -proBNP  
• Serum  pregnancy test :  βhCG test for females of childbearing potential  
• Urine pregnancy test :  hCG test for females of childbearing potential  (Baseline Visit only)  
Blood for clinical labs should be collected at predose and at 4 hours post -dose on Day 1 and on 
Day 2 for patient s in the PK sub- study.  For all other visits, blood should be collected only at 
predose.  
The Investigator is responsible for determining if out of range laboratory values are clinically 
significant or not.  All clinically significant values will be recorded as AEs in the eCRF and 
followed until stabilization, resolution, or loss to follow up.  Once resolved, the appropriate 
AE/SAE eCRF page(s) will be updated.  
Details on sample collection and processing procedures will be provided in a separate laboratory 
manual.  
6.6. Physical Examinations  
A full physical exam  (PE) will consist of assessments of the  following: skin, ears, nose, throat, 
head, eyes, lungs/chest, heart, abdomen, musculoskeletal, extremities, neurologic, and lymphatic .      
A brief physical exam includes all the body systems of the full PE, except for eyes, 
musculoskeletal , and neurologi c. 
All physical exam findings must be assessed as not clinically significant or clinically significant 
by the Investigator and recorded in the source document and eCRF.  Clinically significant changes 
noted in PE findings should be recorded as an AE. 
6.7. Vital  Signs  
Vital signs will be obtained per site standard of care to include oral temperature  (°F or °C, with 
units indicated ), blood pressure (mmHg) , respiratory rate ( breaths per minute ), and heart rate (beats 
per minute [bpm]).  Blood pressure , respiratory rate, and heart rate will be obtained after the patient  
has been upright  and rested  for at least 5 minutes .

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 of 67 6.8. Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT)  
The 6MWT should be performed as described by the guidelines from the American Thoracic 
Society ( ATS 2002) .  Required equipment, detailed instructions, and a worksheet for data 
collection is provided in Appendix 7.  
6.9. Assessment Windows  
The actual time of the assessments must be recorded .  At the Baseline visit, 6MWT should be 
performed prior to administration of inhaled treprostinil (Tyvaso or LIQ861) , and the actual start 
and end time should be recorded.  At all subsequent visits, 6MWT should be performed between 
15 and 60 minutes after administration of LIQ861, and the actual start and end time should be 
recorded.  
Collection of PK samples should occur  as close to the nominal timepoint as possible .  The 
actual time of PK sample collection  will be recorded.  All other assessments should be scheduled 
around the collection of PK samples at their nominal timepoints.   
6.10. Patient Questionnaires  
For all patient s, the MLWHF  questionnaire  (Rector and Cohn 1992) will be administered  at 
Baseline (Day 1), Visit 5 (Month  2), Visit 6 (Month 4) , and every 12 months thereafter.  
For all Tyvaso Transition patient s, responses to the Inhalation Device User Survey (Appendix  5) 
will be collected  at Baseline (Day 1), Visit 3 (Week 2), Visit 6 (Month 4) , and every 12 months 
thereafter.    
7. ADVERSE EVENTS  
The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the 
definition of an AE or SAE as provided in this protocol.  Only T reatment -Emergent AEs (TEAEs) 
and SAEs (occurring after the first inhalation of LIQ861, or Tyvaso in t he PK sub- study, through 
the appropriate follow -up period) will be recorded in this study.    
Definitions and terminology relevant to IND Safety Reports, as referenced in the U.S. Code of 
Federal Regulations, are addressed below.  
7.1. Definition of a Treatment -Emergent Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related.  All AE s that occur after the time of treatment with the 
investigational product will be considered a Treat ment Emergent AE (TEAE).  
A TEAE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about 
causality.  
A TEAE does  include any:  
• Exacerbatio n of a pre -existing illness.  
• Increase in frequency or intensity of a pre- existing episodic event or condition. 
• Condition detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it may have been 
present prior to the start of the study.  
Liquidia Technologies, Inc.   
Protocol LTI -301  Amendment 3 ( 20-Mar-19) 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 of 67 • Continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at baseline that worsen following the start 
of the study.  
• Events considered by the investigator to be related to study -mandated procedures.  
• Abnormal assessments (e.g., change i n physical examination), if they represen t a clinically 
relevant finding, that were not present at Baseline or worsened during the course of the study.  
• Laboratory test abnormalities, if they represent a clinically relevant finding, symptomatic or 
not, which were not present at Baseline or worsened during the course of the study.  
A TEAE does not  include a/an:  
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); the 
condition that leads to the procedure is an AE.  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurre nce has not occurred (e.g., hospitalization for 
cosmetic elective surgery, social and/or convenience admissions).  
• Overdose of either study drug or concurrent medication without any signs or symptoms.  
• Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing  condition that did not worsen during the 
study is not considered an AE. 
7.1.1. Definition of a Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Suspected adverse reaction means any TEAE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the TE AE.  For the purposes of IN D safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the TEAE.  A suspected 
adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which 
means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
The following examples are the types of evidence that would suggest a causal relationship between 
the drug and the TEAE and would justify the consideration of an event as a suspected adverse 
reaction:   
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated 
with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, throat irritation ).  
• One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, 
but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture) .  
Suspected adverse reactions  are the subset of all adverse events for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the event.  Inherent in this definition, and in the requirement to 
report them, is the need to evaluate the available evidence and render  judgment about the likelihood 
that the drug actually caused the adverse event.  FDA considers the definition of suspected adverse 
reaction and the application of the reasonable possibility  of causality standard to be consistent with 
the concepts and discussion about causality in the International Conference on Harmonization 
(ICH) E2A guidance.  
7.1.2. Definition of an Adverse Reaction  
An adverse reaction means any adverse event caused by a drug.  A dverse reactions are a subset of 
all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event. 
Liquidia Technologies, Inc.   
Protocol LTI -301  Amendment 3 ( 20-Mar-19) 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 67 7.1.3. Definition of Unexpected Adverse Event or Unexpected Suspected Adverse 
Reaction  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpect ed” if it is not listed in the 
Investigator ’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or s everity that has been observed.  For 
example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of g reater severity) 
if the Investigator ’s Brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  
"Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to TEAEs or suspected adverse react ions that 
are mentioned in the I nvestigator ’s Brochure as occu rring with a class of drugs , or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring 
with the particular drug under investigation.  For example, although angioedema is anticipated to 
occur in some patients exposed to drugs in the Angiotensin- Converting Enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor 
class and  angioe dema would be described in the I nvestigator ’s Brochure as a class, the first case 
of angioedema observed with the drug under investigation should be considered unexpected for 
reporting purposes.  
This definition relies entirely on a listing of the adverse events or suspected adverse reactions in 
the Investigator ’s Brochure as the basis for determining if newly acquired information generated 
from clinical trials or reported from other sources is unexpected.  The suspected adverse reactions 
listed in the I nvestigator ’s Brochure (i.e., “expected”) are those observed wit h the investigational 
drug and for which a causal relationship between the event and the drug is suspected or confirmed.   
7.1.4. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A TEAE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serio us” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:   
a. Death.  
b. A life -threatening TEAE.  
• A TEAE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the 
view of either the investigator or sp onsor, its occurrence places the patient at 
immediate risk of death.  It does not include a TEAE or suspected adverse reaction 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.   
c. Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hos pitalization.  
• Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen during the study is not considered a TEAE. 
• Complications that occur during hospitalization are TEAEs.  If a complication 
prolongs hospitalization, the event is an SAE.  
• “Inpatient” hospitalization means the patient  has been formally admitted to a 
hospital for medical reasons.  This may or may not be overnight.  It does not include 
presentation at a casualty or emergency room.  
d. A persistent or significant incap acity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• This is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance 
such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, accidental 
Liquidia Technologies, Inc.   
Protocol LTI -301  Amendment 3 ( 20-Mar-19) 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 67 trauma ( i.e., sprained ankle) that may interfere or prevent everyday life functions 
but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. A congenital anomaly in the offspring of a patient  who received drug.  
f. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient  and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Ex amples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in patient  hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
• Medical and scientific judgment should be used in deciding whether prompt 
reporting is appropriate in this situation.  
Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  An SAE 
is not necessarily severe (e.g., an overnight hospitalization for a diagnostic procedure must be 
reported as an SAE even though the occurrence is not medically serious).  Similarly, a severe AE 
is not necessarily serious (e.g., nausea lasting for several hours may be rated as severe but may not 
be considered serious).  
7.2. Adverse Device Effect and Serious Adverse Device Effect  
An Adverse Device Event (ADE) is defined as any untoward and unintended response to a medical 
device.   In this case, an ADE would refer to any untoward and unintended respons e to the RS00 
Model 8 DPI.  
A Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE) is an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of 
the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event or that might have led to any of these 
consequences if suitable action had not been taken or intervention had not been made or if 
circumstances had been less opportune.  
A device event may also be a SAE if the product involved a participant in the clinical trial.  A test 
article (device) that malfunctioned prior to use in a clinic al research participant would not be a 
SAE for the participant.  However, if the device malfunctioned or broke once use was attempted 
by the participant; it would be reportable as an AE, or as a SAE if serious criteria were met . 
7.2.1. Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
Unanticipated adverse device effect is any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously identified i n nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational 
plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated 
serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of par ticipants.  
All unanticipated adverse devi ce effects must be reported by the Investigator to the Sponsor 
within 3 days from identification or awareness of the event.  Investigators are responsible for 
preparing and submitting complete, accurate, and timely reports to the reviewing IRB of any 
unanticipated adverse device effect occurring during an investigation as soon as possible, but in 
no event , later than 10 working days after they first learn of the effect.  
Liquidia Technologies, Inc.   
Protocol LTI -301  Amendment 3 ( 20-Mar-19) 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 of 67 Any device that is associated with an unantici pated adverse device effect should be collected 
from the patient in accordance with the same procedures as any other used device (i.e., device 
accountability and marked for destruction).  
If the Sponsor determines that an unanticipated adverse device effect , as reported by an 
Investigator, presents an unreasonable risk to the subject, the Sponsor shall terminate all 
investigations or parts of investigations presenting that risk as soon as possible. 
7.3. Severity of TEAEs/SAEs  
The severity (mild, moderate, or seve re) of each TEAE/SAE must be assessed by the Investigator, 
or designee.  The following criteria should be considered when assessing severity:  
• Mild  The symptom is barely noticeable to the patient  and does not 
influence performance or functioning.   
• Moderate  The symptom is of sufficient severity to make the patient  
uncomfortable, and performance of daily activities is 
influenced.  Treatment for the symptom may be needed.  
• Severe  The symptom causes  severe discomfort.  Treatment for the 
symptom may be necessary.  
7.4. Assessment of Relatedness to Study Drug or Device  
The Investigator will assess each TEAE and ADE for causality based on their medical judgment 
and the observed symptoms associated with the e vent.  Each TEAE and ADE will be assessed as 
related or unrelated to study drug based on the following criteria:  
• Unrelated  This category applies to those TEAEs  and ADEs  that the 
Investigator determines are most likely due to extraneous causes 
(disease, environment, etc.) and does not follow a reasonable 
temporal relationship.   
• Related  This category applies to those TEAEs  and ADEs  that the 
Investigator determines are mo st likely due to test drug  or 
device.  
7.5. Method, Frequency, and Time Period for Detecting Adverse Events and 
Serious Adverse Events  
At appropriate intervals (e.g., at every study visit and telephone contact), patient s should be 
assessed for TEAEs and SAEs.  After the patient  has had an opportunity to spontaneously mention 
any problems, the Investigator should inquire about TEAEs by asking a non- leading question such 
as the following:  
1. “How are you feeling?”  
2. “Have you had any medical problems since your last as sessment/visit?”  
3. “Have you taken any new medicines since your last assessment/visit?”  
Liquidia Technologies, Inc.   
Protocol LTI -301  Amendment 3 ( 20-Mar-19) 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 of 67 7.6. Reporting AEs and SAEs  
7.6.1. Reporting Adverse Events  
AEs occurring from when the patient  signs the  Informed Consent Form  (ICF) until the last study 
event will be recorded.  All AEs and SAEs occurring prior to the first inhalation of LIQ861 will 
be recorded in the medical history.  Also, any sign, symptom, or disease present before the first 
inhalation of LIQ861 are considered AEs  only if they have worsened after the first inhalation of 
LIQ861.  
If the investigator detects an AE in a study patient after the last scheduled follow -up visit and 
considers the event related to treatment with LIQ861, the investigator should report it to t he 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor. 
The investigator should report all AEs on the AE page(s) of the eCRF and source documents, 
regardless of seriousness, severity, and causality.  Whenever possible, an AE will be reported using 
a diagnostic term (e.g., “common c old” or “upper respiratory infection” rather than “runny nose, 
cough, mild fever”) and should be described with the attributes described in terms of severity 
(Section 7.3) and relatedness (Section 7.4).  
7.6.2. Timeframes for Reporting SAEs /SADEs  
Prompt notifica tion of the Sponsor regarding SAEs /SADEs  is essential so that ethical and 
regulatory responsibilities and legal obligations can be satisfied.  The Investigator must report 
SAEs /SADEs  according to the following time frames:      
• Death or Life- Threatening Ev ent: 
o Initial notification  must be provided to the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor , or designee , 
within 24 hours  of the Investigational site learning of the death or life -threatening 
event (regardless of causality).   
o Complete SAE /SADE  information (i.e., all SAE /SADE  pages) must be sent to the 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or designee and the Sponsor’s clinical operations lead, 
or designee , within 24 hours  of receipt of the information by the Investigational 
site.  
o Follow -up information must be sent to the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor , or designee , 
within 24 hours  of receipt of the information by the Investigational site.  
• All other SAEs   
o Complete SAE information (i.e., all SAE pages) must be sent to the Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor , or designee , within 24 hours  of receipt of the information by the 
Investigational site . 
o Follow -up information must be sent to the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor , or designee , 
and the Sponsor’s clinical operations lead, or designee , within 24 hours  of receipt 
of the information by the Investigational site.  
7.6.3. SAE /SADE  Information to Report  
At a minimum, initial SAE /SADE  reports must contain the site name and number, patient ID, 
patient demographic information, details of study drug administration, the  serious adverse event 
Liquidia Technologies, Inc.   
Protocol LTI -301  Amendment 3 ( 20-Mar-19) 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 67 term, onset date, severity, relationship to study drug, and a brief narrative of the event.  If the 
patient died, the report should include the cause of death and whether or not the death was related 
to the study drug, as well as any  autopsy findings, if available.  Please note that relationship to 
study drug/causality is very important  and must be included in the initial report as it may impact 
expedited regulatory reporting requirements for the event.   Do not, however, delay reporti ng of an 
SAE in order to obtain additional information.  Additional information may be reported as a 
follow -up report as described in Section 7.6.8. 
Complete SAE /SADE  information should be reported in compliance with the Sponsor’s Safety 
Management Plan for this study.  
There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested.  However, 
it is not acceptable for the Investigator to send ph otocopies of the patient s’ medical records 
in lieu of completion of the appropriate AE/SAE pages .  If medical records are submitted, all 
patient  personal identifiers must be completely and thoroughly redacted prior to submission.  
7.6.4. SAE /SADE  Reporting Contact Information  
Individual sites should report SAEs to NorthAmerica_Medical@parexel.com  based on the 
timeframes given in Section 7.6.2. 
7.6.5. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as 
TEAEs and SAEs  
The Investigator should exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether 
an abnormal l aboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically relevant.  
Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology) or other abnormal 
assessments (e.g., vital signs) that are judged by the Investigator as clinically relevant must be 
recorded in the medical history or as TEAEs or SAEs if they meet the definition of an adverse 
event.  Clinically relevant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are 
detected after the first inhalation of LIQ861, or that are present  before administration of LIQ861 
but worsen after the first inhalation of LIQ861, should be assessed for AE criteria.  
7.6.6. Documenting SAEs /SADEs  
A separate set of SAE pages should be used for each SAE.  However, if at the time of initial 
reporting, multiple SA Es are present that are temporally and/or clinically related, they may be 
reported on the same SAE page.  
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the TEAE 
and/or SAE term.  
7.6.7. Regulatory/Ethics reporting requirement  
The Investigator must comply with the applicable local regulatory requirements related to the 
reporting of SAEs to the Sponsor.  Additionally, the Investigator will be responsible for submitting 
SAE reports to the IRB/EC. 
The Sponsor , or designee , will be responsible for submitting SAE reports to applicable regulatory 
authorities.

Protocol LTI -301  Amendment 3 ( 20-Mar-19) 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44 of 67 7.6.8. Follow -up of TEAEs and SAEs  
All TEAEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit/ contact that are designated as ongoing will 
be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts.  TEAEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, 
until the condition stabilizes, or until the patient  is lost to follow -up.  Once resolved, the 
appropriate TEAE/SAE eC RF page(s) will be updated.  If a patient  dies during participation in the 
study or during a recognized follow -up period, a copy of any post -mortem findings, including 
histopathology, should be obtained, if available, and forwarded to the Sponsor , or desig nee.  New 
or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE Report Form with all 
changes signed and dated by the Investigator , or designee.   
8. STATISTICS  
An integrated statistical and PK analysis plan (SAP) will provide details of pla nned analyses and 
summary documents, such as tables, listings and figures.  An overview of the planned analyses is 
provided here.  However, final analyses may  not be limited to the summaries described herein.  
8.1. Determination of Sample Size  
Safety Study : Appr oximately  130 patient s will be enrolled in the Main Study to ensure that at 
least 100 patient s are evaluated for safety .    
PK Sub- Study:  The PK Sub- Study will enroll at least  18 PAH patient s to evaluate the comparative  
bioavailability of treprostinil from  LIQ861 to treprostinil from Tyvaso .  The number of patient s 
enrolled is sufficient to support such pharmacokinetic analyses.        
8.2. Analysis Populations  
The analysis populations are defined as follows:  
• Safety Population  will include all patient s who receive at least one inhalation of LIQ861 and 
provide at least one  post -Baseline safety assessment.  
• Pharmacokinetic Population (PK Population ) will include all patient s in the PK Sub- Study 
who have not had any adverse events or protocol violations deemed to impact the PK, and have 
sufficient quantifiable samples collected for estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters  from  
Day 1 of the crossover . 
Safety endpoints will be reported for patient s in the Safety Population.  PK analyses will be 
performed on patient s in the PK population.  Inclusion of various populations in specific 
exploratory analyses will be defined in the SAP.   
8.3. Baseline Characteristics and Patient  Disposition  
Overall Baseline and demographic data will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  Patien t 
disposition (e.g., the number of patient s enrolled, completed, and discontinued) will be 
summarized and medical history data will be listed.   
8.4. Hypothesis  
No formal hypothesis tes ting is planned.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 45 of 67 8.5. Exploratory Analys es 
All analyses for the exploratory endpoints described in Section 3.2.4 will be described in the  
SAP.  
8.6. Noncompartmental Pharmacokinetic Analyses (PK s ub-study)  
Treprostinil concentrations will be summarized , by treatment,  using descriptive statistics 
(including sample size ( N), mean, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV%), 
median, minimum, and maximum) for each treatment.  Concentrations below the limit of 
quantification (BLQ) will be treated as zero for the computation of descriptive statistics and for 
construction of mean concentration- time profiles.  Concentrations assigned a value of mis sing will 
be omitted from the calculation of descriptive statistics.  
For pharmacokinetic analysis, treprostinil concentrations below the limit of quantification (BLQ) 
will be assigned a value of zero when they precede quantifiable samples in the initial portion of 
the profile.  Following Cmax, BLQ values embedded between two quantifiable data points will be 
treated as missing when calculating area under the curve.  BLQ values occurring at the end of the 
collection interval (after the last quantifiable conc entration) will be treated as missing data.  When 
consecutive BLQ concentrations follow quantifiable concentrations in the terminal portion of the 
concentration curve, these quantified values will be excluded from the PK analysis by assigning 
them a value of missing, unless otherwise warranted by the concentration- time profile.  
The PK parameters in Table 1 will be estimated by noncompartmental methods from plasma 
sampl es.  Actual elapsed time from dosing will be used to estimate all individual PK parameters.  
The final list of PK parameters reported will be described in the SAP.  
Table 1.  Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
Cmax  Maximum observed plasma concentration  
Tmax  Time of maximum concentration (h), obtained directly 
from the observed concentration versus time data.  
AUClast  Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time

Derived plasma PK descriptive statistics will be tabulated by treatment and repor ted with summary 
statistics.  Descriptive statistics for PK parameters (Cmax, Tmax, AUClast, AUCinf, λ z, t1/2, Vz/F, 
CL/F , Frel ) will include the arithmetic and geometric mean (for Cmax, AUClast, and AUCinf, 
only), CV%, SD of the arithmetic mean, median, m inimum, maximum, and N.   
Relative bioavailability (Frel) will be calculated for all patient s that complete both days  of the PK 
sub-study assessments using the following formula:

9.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
9.1.1. Good Clinical Practice  
The Investigator  will ensure that this study is conducted in full compliance with the principles of 
the “Declaration of Helsinki”, ICH guidelines, or with the laws and regulations of the country in 
which the research is conducted, whichever affords the g reater protection to the study patient .  For 
studies conducted under a United States IND, such as this study, the Investigator will ensure that 
the basic principles of “Good Clinical Practice,” as outlined in 21 CFR 312, subpart D, 
“Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investig ators,” 21 CFR, part 50 and 21 CFR, part 56 are adhered 
to.  The PK sub- study study is also subject to and will be conducted in compliance with 21 CFR, 
part 320, “Retention of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Testing Samples.”  
9.1.2. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) Approval  
This protocol and any accompanying material to be provided to the patient  (such as advertisements, 
patient  information sheets, or descriptions of the study used to obtain informed consent) will be 
reviewed and approved by the governing IRB /EC of the participating center prior to  study 
initiation.   Approval from the IRB /EC should be documented in a letter to the Investigator 
specifying the protocol number, protocol version, documents reviewed, and date on which the 
committee met and granted the approval.  
Any modifications or amendment to documents originally submitted for review must also be 
submitted to the IRB /EC for approval prior to implementation.  Additionally, the IRB/EC must be 
informed of any serious or unexpected AEs, new information that may adversely affect the safety 
of the patient s or the conduct of the study, annual updates and/or requests for re -approval, and 
when the study has been completed.  
9.1.3. Informed Consent  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator or designee to obtain written informed consent from each 
individual participating in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives, 
and potential hazards of the study and prior to undertaking any study -related procedures.  The 
Investi gator , or designee , must utilize an IRB -approved consent form for documenting written 
informed consent.  Each informed consent will be appropriately signed and dated by the patient

Protocol LTI -301  Amendment 3 ( 20-Mar-19) 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 47 of 67 and the person obtaining consent.  A copy of the signed consent form will be provided to the patient  
and the original will be maintained with the patient ’s records . 
9.1.4. Conflicts of Interest  
The Investigator will be paid by the Sponsor of this study for study -related expenses, but will not 
profit from results, whether positive or neg ative, with regard to the product being evaluated.  The 
Investigator will disclose any financial conflicts of interest to the Sponsor, should they arise, as 
required in 21 CFR part 54. 
9.1.5. Confidentiality  
The Investigator must assure that patient s’ anonymity will be strictly maintained and that their 
identities are protected from unauthorized parties.  Only patient  initials and an identification code 
(i.e., not names) should be recorded on any form submitte d to the sponsor and IRB.  The 
Investigator must keep a patient  log showing codes, names, and addresses for all patient s screened 
and for all patient s enrolled in the trial.  
9.1.6. Study Files and Retention of Records  
The Investigator must maintain adequate and a ccurate records to enable the conduct of the study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified.  These documents should 
be classified into 2 separate categories (although not limited to) the following (1) Investigator’s 
study file , and (2) patient  clinical source documents.  
The Investigator’s study file will contain the protocol/amendments, eCRF and query forms, 
IRB/EC approval with correspondence, informed consent, drug records, staff curriculum vitae and 
authorization forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence.  
Patient  clinical source documents can include (although is not limited to) the following:  patient  
hospital/clinic records, physician’s and nurse’s notes, appointment book, original l aboratory 
reports, electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), X -ray, pathology and special 
assessment reports, consultant letters, screening and enrollment log, etc.   
All clinical study documents must be retained by the Investigator until at lea st two years after the 
last approval of a marketing application in an International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) 
region (i.e., United States, Europe, or Japan) and until there are no pending or contemplated 
marketing applications in an ICH region; or, until two years after the IND is discontinued and 
regulatory authorities have been notified.  The Investigator must notify the Sponsor  prior to 
destroying any clinical study records.  
Should the Investigator wish to move study records to another location, arrangements must be 
made to store these in sealed containers so that they can be returned sealed to the Investigator in 
case of a regulatory audit.  Where source documents are required for the continued care of the 
patient , appropriate copies should be ma de for storage outside of the site.  
9.1.7. Case Report Forms  
For each patient  who receives study drug, an eCRF must be completed and signed by the principal 
Investigator or sub- Investigator within a reasonable time period after data collection.  This also 
applies  to records for those patient s who fail to complete the study.  If a patient  withdraws from 
the study, the reason must be noted on the eCRF.  If a patient  is withdrawn from the study because 
Liquidia Technologies, Inc.   
Protocol LTI -301  Amendment 3 ( 20-Mar-19) 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 48 of 67 of a treatment -limiting adverse event, thorough efforts should be  made to clearly document the 
outcome. 
9.1.8. Drug Accountability  
The Investigator , or designee (i.e., pharmacist) , is responsible for ensuring adequate accountability 
of all used and unused study drug.  This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of  
study product (quantity and condition), inventory at the site, distribution to, collection from, use 
by patient , and the destruction or return of unused study medication to the Sponsor.  Dispensing 
records will document quantities received and quantities dispensed to patient s, including lot 
number, date dispensed, patient  identifier number, patient  initials, and the initials of the person 
dispensing the medication.  The Investigator will assure that the study medication and records 
described in this sectio n will be stored in a locked cabinet suitable for storage of pharmaceutical 
products and in accordance with the conditions specified in the Investigator’s Brochure .  
Investigators must also assure that study medication and records will be available for exa mination 
by the study monitor during periodic visits. 
During the study, the investigator will be notified of any expiry dates or retest date extensions of 
study drug supplies.  If an expiry date notification is received during the study, the site must 
comp lete all instructions outlined in the notification, including segregation of expired clinical 
study material for destruction or return to the Sponsor or its designee.  
At study initiation, the monitor will evaluate the site’s standard operating procedure fo r study drug 
disposal/destruction in order to ensure that it complies with study requirements.  Accountability 
records and inventory will be inspected during periodic visits throughout the study.  Drug 
reconciliation may also be performed by a monitor duri ng periodic visits, and the site may return 
used drug kits after reconciliation has been completed.  At the Study Termination Visit, following 
final drug reconciliation by the monitor, the study site will be instructed by the  Sponsor or its 
designee to ret urn all unused study drug supplies, including empty containers. 
9.1.9. Inspections  
The Investigator will provide access to source documents and all study records for this trial to 
appropriately qualified personnel from the Sponsor , or its representatives, and to regulatory 
authority inspectors.  
9.2. Sponsor Responsibilities  
9.2.1. Study Materials and Instructions  
It is the sponsor’s responsibility to ensure that the Investigator is provided with the documents and 
other study materials necessary to conduct the study.  Examples  of those materials include, but are 
not limited to: protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, study drug, eCRF, SAE collection forms, logs, 
etc.  The sponsor will also provide training and oversight through site and medical monitoring.  
9.2.2. Protocol Modifications  
Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to study patient s, will be 
made by Sponsor -initiated amendment.  IRB/EC approval must be obtained before changes can be 
implemented.

9.3.1. Access to Information for Monitoring  
In accordance with International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH E6  
(R2)) guidelines, study monitors must have direct access to the Investigator’s source 
documentation in order to verify the data  recorded in the eCRFs for consistency.  
The monitors, both central and field monitors, are  responsible for routine review of the eCRFs at 
regular intervals throughout the study, to verify adherence to the protocol, and the completeness, 
consistency and accuracy of the data being entered on them.  The monitor s should have access to 
any patient  records needed to verify the entries on the eCRFs.  The Investigator agrees to cooperate 
with the monitor s to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring activities 
are resolved.  
9.3.2. Study Discontinuation  
Both the sponsor and the Investigator reserve the right to terminate the study at any time.  Should 
this be necessary, both parties will arrange discontinuation procedures and notify the appropriate  
regulatory authority(ies)  and IRBs/ECs.  In terminating the study, the S ponsor and the Investigator 
will assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient s’ interests.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 55 of 67 APPENDIX 2 .  GUIDANCE FOR LIQ861 DOSE SELECTION AND TITRATION  
Dose Titration  
Titration to a higher dose of treprostinil in LIQ861 should be governed by patient’s degree of 
symptomatic relief, not to tolerance of PGI 2 side effects .  If there are no symptoms of PGI 2 excess, 
doses of LIQ861 may be increased in 25 µg  treprostinil stren gth increments according to the 
following guidelines  up to the Maximum Allowed Dose of 150 µg  treprostinil strength .   
Dosing in excess of 150 µg treprostinil strength has not been previously studied and should not be 
implemented without consent from the sponsor .   
Selection of Initial Dose in LIQ861 Add -on Patient s 
Start the patient on LIQ861 QID at the 25 µg  treprostinil capsule strength . 
1. After initial administration of LIQ861, supervise the patient’s condition for a minimum post-
dose observation period of 1 hour and discharge at the discretion of the Investigator.  
2. Patients should be called between Day 5 and Day 7 post -dose to assess sympto matic relief 
and tolerance of LIQ861 therapy and a decision should be made whether to maintain the 
patient at the same dose or to increase to  50 µg LIQ861, administered as a single capsule 
QID.   
3. At the Week 2 Visit, or after 2 week s of stable LIQ861 QID a dministration , if the patient is 
experiencing sufficient symptomatic relief AND is tolerating the treatment, that dose should 
be maintained unless symptoms worsen.   
a. If the patient is not  experiencing sufficient symptomatic relief OR is not  tolerating 
the treatment,  LIQ861 may be increased or decreased by 25  µg treprostinil strength 
increment s, respectively . 
4. Additional dosing increases may be implemented at 25  µg increments per week , however 
dose escalations are limited to a maximum of 150 µg as d osing in excess of 150 µg  
treprostinil strength has not been previously studied and should not be implemented without 
consent of the Sponsor .  Prior to any dose titration  the Investigator should contact the patient 
by phone to assess degree of symptomatic relief and tolerance and need/desire to adjust the 
LIQ861 dose.   
Selection of Initial Dose in Tyvaso Transition  Patient s  
If the patient  is transitioning from Tyvaso , determine the appropriate LIQ 861 starting dose from 
Table 2 below:

≥ 108 µg  ≥ 18  150 µg  
1Tyvaso doses up to 54 µg are cons istent with the label.  However , it is understood  that physicians may choose to 
dose in excess of 54 µg and it is important to explore transitioning these patients given that LIQ861 was well 
tolerated up to 150 µg  in healthy volunteers . 
After initial administration of LIQ 861 on Day 1, supervise the patient’s condition for a minimum 
post-dose observation period of 4 hours.   
For the second and third dose on Day 1, titrate LIQ861 dose in increments of 25 µg  treprostinil 
strength based on clinical observations, patient feedba ck, and Investigator discretion.  The patient 
should be observed for a minimum of 1 hour after the second dose of LIQ861 and may be 
discharged at the discretion of the Investigator.  
At the Week 2 Visit, or after 2 week s of QID administration of LIQ861, if the patient is 
experiencing sufficient symptomatic relief AND is tolerating the treatment,  that dose should be 
maintained unless symptoms worsen.   
a. If the patient is not  experiencing sufficient symptomatic relief OR is not  tolerating 
the treatment, LIQ861 may be increased or decreased by 25  µg treprostinil strength 
increments, respectively.  
Additional dosing increases may be implemented at 25  µg increments per week , however dose 
escalations are limited to a maximum of 150 µg, unless agreed to by the Sponsor .  Prior to any 
dose titration  the Investigator should contact the patient by phone to assess degree of symptomatic 
relief and tolerance and need/desire to adjust the LIQ861 dose.   
Tyvaso Transition  Patient s – PK Sub- Study  Procedures  
If the patient  is transitioning from Tyvaso and is enrolled in the PK Sub- Study, the patient’s final 
dose of Tyvaso on Day 1 of the study, and the  starting dose for LIQ861 should be administered as 
described in Table 3.  In the event that a patient’s prescribed Tyvaso dose is not a multiple of 3 
breaths , the dose administered on Day 1 for PK assessments will be selected as described in Table 
3.

criteria.  
Day 1  
1. PK samplings will be collected over a 4 hour period after administration of the final Tyvaso 
dose.  LIQ861 should be administe red at the appropriate starting dose beginning with the 
second dose on Day 1.  
a. If the starting dose of LIQ861 is not tolerated, the next dose of LIQ861 may be 
decreased by 25  µg treprostinil strength.  
b. If the starting dose does not appear to be providing similar efficacy to the patient’s 
Tyvaso treatment, the next dose of LIQ861 may be increased by 25 µg and the 
patient should be observed for at least an hour after the increase prior to discharge 
from the clinic at the Investigator’s discretion.  
Day 2  
1. For the first dose on Day 2, LIQ861 should be administered at the same dose as the  last 
tolerated dose taken on Day 1, and PK samples should be collected over a 4 hour  period.  After 
completion of the PK sampling, the patient may be discharged at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  
2. At the Week 2 Visit, or after 2 week s of QID administration of LIQ861, if the patient is 
experiencing sufficient symptomatic relief AND is tolerating the treatment,  that dose should 
be maintained unless symptoms worsen.   
b. If the patient is not  experiencing sufficient symptomatic relief OR is not  tolerating

Management of Side Effects  
If symptoms of PGI 2 excess are observed, further dose increases of LIQ861 should be avoided 
until these symptoms subside. 
If side effects cannot be tolerated or medically managed, o ne or more of the following strategies 
may be employed:  
• Reduction of LIQ861 in 25 µg  treprostinil strength increments until symptoms subside  
• Discontinuation of LIQ861 
Employment of any of the above strategies for mitigation of non- tolerated side effects sh ould be 
documented in the eCRFs.

Sample Collection and Processing  
• One (1)  3 mL Vacutainer tube containing ( K2) EDTA (lavender -top blood collection tubes, 
13 x 75 mm , BD Vacutainer catalog # 367856 or equivalent) will be collected for PK 
analysis at each of the time points specified in Section 6.4 of the protocol .  Fill tube as 
completely as possible to ensure sufficient sample volume for the required tests . 
• Immediately after the sample is drawn, gently invert the tube 5 to 10 times to  thoroughly 
mix the anticoagulant and place the tube at room temperature.  Samples can be stored at 
room temperature for up to 60 minutes prior to completing the processing  procedure.  
• Centrifuge the sample at room temperature at 2500 to 3000 rpm (approxima tely 650 to 
1450 x g) for 10 to 15 minutes to achieve a clear plasma layer over the red cells .  The speed 
and time may be varied according to the make and model of centrifuge used.   
• Immediately transfer (approximately) equal portions of the plasma to two (2) properly 
labeled polypropylene sample storage tubes (Sarstedt 3.5 mL tubes, P/N 60.549 or 
equivalent), cap and freeze samples at - 20°C  until shipment.  
Note:  Use of gel separation blood collection tubes is not recommended for PK sample analysis, 
as drug may be absorbed by the barrier gel.  
Sample Collection and Processing  
• All sample shipments should be preceded by a phone call or fax prior to their receipt.   All 
HIV positive or other known infectious sample shipments must be preceded by a phone 
call or facsimile prior to their receipt.  
• Detailed sample inventory information must accompany the samples.   Lack of paperwork 
or illegible information will delay sample login and project initiation.   Samples that are 
unclearly or incompletely labeled may be sub ject to additional handling fees.   Submission 
of sample inventory information in electronic form is encouraged.  
• Frozen samples should be shipped via overnight courier with an adequate amount of dry 
ice Monday through Wednesday  to the following: 
ACM Global Laboratory  
Attn: Clinical Trials Specimen Management 
150 Elmgrove Park  
Rochester, NY 14624  
• Notify ACM  by e-mail, facsimile, or telephone that a shipment is leaving your l ocation.   
Upon arrival, the shipment will be unpacked and the contents verifie d and documented.   If 
requested, the individual responsible at the shipment point of origin will be notified of 
sample disposition . 
• Backup samples should be stored frozen at the Investigational site until successful receipt 
of initial shipment is confirme d by ACM.

Evidence of severe hepatic impairment will be assessed by simply documenting the patient’s 
history or presence of ascites and encephalopathy.   A patient will be considered to have severe 
hepatic impairment if the  patient both:  
• has evidence of ascites, AND  
• has been diagnosed with or has evidence of encephalopathy grade of 1 or higher based on 
the West Haven Criteria.  
Any patient fitting this profile should be excluded from the study.  
 
Renal impairment will be assessed by calculating estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using 
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation  (CDER 2010) :  
eGFR =175  × (Serum  Creatinine )−1.154 × (Age)−0.203 × (0.742,𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴𝐹𝐹𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹) × (1.212,𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐹𝐹𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑓𝑓𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴𝑓𝑓𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑓𝑓𝐴𝐴) 
Where Serum Creatinine is measured in mg/dL, Age is measured in years, and eGFR is measured 
in mL/min/1.73m2.  Subjects with eGFR less than 45 will be excluded from the PK sub- study and 
subjects with eGFR of les s than 30 will be excluded altogether.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 63 of 67 APPENDIX 7.  6MWT INSTRUCTIONS AND WORKSHEET  
The following instructions on performing a 6MWT are reproduced from the guidelines published 
by the American Thoracic Society ( ATS 2002) .  A sample data collection worksheet and Borg 
Scale are provided at the end of the instructions ( below ). 
Safety Considerations  
Testing should be performed in a location where a rapid, appropriate response to an emergency is 
possible. The appropriate location of a crash cart should be determined by the physician 
supervising the facility . 
Supplies that must be available include : 
• oxygen,  
• sublingual nitroglycerine,  
• aspirin, and  
• albuterol (metered dose inhaler or n ebulizer).  
A telephone or other means should be in place to enable a call for help.  
The technician should be certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation with a minimum of Basic 
Life Support by an American Health Association–approved cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
course. Advanced cardiac life support certification is desirable. Training, experience, and 
certification in related health care fields (registered nurse, registered respiratory therapist, 
certified pulmonary function technici an, etc.) are also desirable. A certified individual should be 
readily available to respond if needed.  
Physicians are not required to be present during all tests. The physician ordering the test or a 
supervising laboratory physician may decide whether phys ician attendance at a specific test is 
required.  
If a patient is on chronic oxygen therapy, oxygen should be given at their standard rate or as 
directed by a physician or a protocol.  
Reasons for immediately stopping a 6MWT include the following:  
• chest pain,  
• intolerable dyspnea,  
• leg cramps,  
• staggering,  
• diaphoresis, and  
• pale or ashen appearance.  
Technicians must be trained to recognize these problems and the appropriate responses. If a  test 
is stopped for any of these reasons, the patient should sit or lie supine as appropriate depending 
on the severity or the event and the technician's assessment of the severity of the event and the 
risk of syncope. The following should be obtained bas ed on the judg ment of the technician:  
• blood pressure,  
• pulse rate,  
• oxygen saturation, and

Protocol LTI -301  Amendment 3 ( 20-Mar-19) 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 64 of 67 • physician evaluation.  
Oxygen should be administered as appropriate.  
Technical Requirements and Equipment  
The 6MWT should be performed indoors, along a long, flat, st raight, enclosed corridor with a 
hard surface that is seldom traveled.   The walking course must be 30 m in length; a  100-ft 
hallway is, therefore, required. The length of the corridor should be marked every 3 m. The 
turnaround points should be marked with a cone (such as an orange traffic cone). A starting line, 
which marks the beginning and end of each 60 -m lap, should be marked on the floor using 
brightly colored tape.  
The following equipment is required to conduct the assessment:  
• Countdown timer (or stopwatch)  
• Mechanical lap counter  
• Two small cones to mark the turnaround points  
• A chair that can be easily moved along the walking course  
• Worksheets on a clipboard 
• A source of oxygen  
• Sphygmomanometer  
• Telephone  
• Automated electronic defibrillator  
In preparation for the assessment, patients should:  
• Wear comfortable clothing and appropriate shoes for walking,  
• Use their usual walking aids, such as a cane or walker,  
• Continue their usual medical regimen  
• Not have exercised vigorously within 2 hours of the beginning of the test.  
Additionally, a light meal is acceptable before early morning or early afternoon exams.  
Instructions for Conducting the 6MWT  
1. Repeat testing should be performed about the same time of day to minimize intraday 
variability.  
A “warm -up” period before the test should not be performed.  
The patient should sit at rest in a chair, located near the starting position, for at least 10 minutes 
before the test starts. During this time, check for contraindications, measure pulse and blood 
pressure, and make sure that clothing and shoes are appropriate. Compete the Patient Information  
portion of the data collection worksheet ( below ). 
Pulse oximetry is option al. If it is performed, measure and record baseline heart rate and oxygen 
saturation (SpO 2) and follow manufacturer's instructions to maximize the signal and to minimize 
motion artifact. Make sure the readings are stable before recording. Note pulse regularity and 
whether the oximeter signal quality is acceptable.  
Liquidia Technologies, Inc.   
Protocol LTI -301  Amendment 3 ( 20-Mar-19) 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 65 of 67 a. The SpO 2 should not be used for constant monitoring during the exercise. The 
technician must not walk with the patient to observe the SpO 2. If worn during the 
walk, the pulse oximeter must be lightweight (less than 2 pounds), battery 
powered, and held in place (perhaps by a “fanny pack”) so that the patient does 
not have to hold or stabilize it and so that stride is not affected.  
Have the patient stand and rate their baseline dyspnea and overal l fatigue using the Borg scale  
provided below . 
Set the lap counter to zero and the timer to 6 minutes. Assemble all necessary equipment (lap 
counter, timer, clipboard, Borg Scale, worksheet) and move to the starting point. 
Instruct the patient as follows: 
“The object of this test is to walk as far as possible for 6 minutes. You will walk 
back and forth in this hallway. Six minutes is a long time to walk, so you wil l be 
exerting yourself. You will probably get out of breath or become exhausted. You 
are permitted to slow down, to stop, and to rest as necessary. You may lean against 
the wall while resting, but resume walking as soon as you are able.  
You will be walking  back and forth around the cones. You should pivot briskly 
around the cones and continue back the other way without hesitation. Now I'm 
going to show you. Please watch the way I turn without hesitation.”  
Demonstrate by walking one lap yourself. Walk and pi vot around a cone briskly.  
“Are you ready to do that? I am going to use this counter to keep track of the number 
of laps you complete. I will click it each time you turn around at this starting line. 
Remember that the object is to walk AS FAR AS POSSIBLE f or 6 minutes, but 
don't run or jog.  
Start now, or whenever you are ready.”  
Position the patient at the starting line. You should also stand near the starting line during 
the test. Do not walk with the patient. As soon as the patient starts to walk, start the timer.  
Do not talk to anyone during the walk. Use an even tone of voice when using the standard 
phrases of encouragement. Watch the patient. Do not get distracted and lose count of the 
laps. Each time the participant returns to the starting line, click the lap counter once (or 
mark the lap on the worksheet). Let the participant see you do it. Exaggerate the click using 
body language, like using a stopwatch at a race.  
After the first minute, tell the patient the following (in even tones): “You are d oing well. 
You have 5 minutes to go.”  
When the timer shows 4 minutes remaining, tell the patient the following: “Keep up the 
good work. You have 4 minutes to go.”  
When the timer shows 3 minutes remaining, tell the patient the following: “You are doing 
well. You are halfway done.”  
When the timer shows 2 minutes remaining, tell the patient the following: “Keep up the 
good work. You have only 2 minutes left.”  
Liquidia Technologies, Inc.   
Protocol LTI -301  Amendment 3 ( 20-Mar-19) 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 66 of 67 When the timer shows only 1 minute remaining, tell the patient: “You are doing well. You 
have only 1 m inute to go.”  
Do not use other words of encouragement (or body language to speed up).  
If the patient stops walking during the test and needs a rest, say this: “You can lean against 
the wall if you would like; then continue walking whenever you feel able.” Do not stop the 
timer. If the patient stops before the 6 minutes are up and refuses to continue (or you decide 
that they should not continue), wheel the chair over for the patient to sit on, discontinue the 
walk, and note on the worksheet the distance, the  time stopped, and the reason for stopping 
prematurely.  
When the timer is 15 seconds from completion, say this: “In a moment I'm going to tell 
you to stop. When I do, just stop right where you are and I will come to you.”  
When the timer rings (or buzzes), say this: “Stop!” Walk over to the patient. Consider 
taking the chair if they look exhausted. Mark the spot where they stopped by placing a bean 
bag or a piece of tape on the floor.  
When the timer is 15 seconds from completion, say this: “In a moment I'm g oing to tell

bag or a piece of tape on the floor.  
After the test record the postwalk Borg dyspnea and fatigue levels and ask this: “What, if 
anything, kept you from walking farther?”  
If using a pulse oximeter, measure SpO 2 and pulse rate from the oximete r and then remove the 
sensor.  
Record the number of laps from the counter (or tick marks on the worksheet). 
Record the additional distance covered (the number of meters in the final partial lap) using the 
markers on the wall as distance guides. Calculate th e total distance walked, rounding to the 
nearest meter, and record it on the worksheet.  
Congratulate the patient on good effort and offer a drink of water.

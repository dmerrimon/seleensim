The EMPRESS  study is a post market prospective,  non-randomized,  single-arm, multicenter  study, 
designed  to demonstrate  dose response  of the Emprint™  Ablation System using a percutaneous  approach  
in patients with metastatic  or primary lung tumors. 
This document  provides a detailed description of the statistical methods  and procedures to be 
implemented  during the analysis of the study. 
The proposed  methods  and approaches  to the data analysis should be viewed as flexible if the data 
suggest and warrant deviations from this plan. However, any deviations from this analysis plan must be 
substantiated by a sound statistical rationale and documented  in the final clinical study report. This 
statistical analysis plan (SAP) is based on version 2 of the protocol dated February  24, 2015. 
 
 
 
The primary objective  of this post-market clinical study is to demonstrate technical  performance  of a CT- 
guided percutaneous  microwave  ablation system in patients with metastatic  lung tumors or recurrent  
primary lung tumors. 
 
Following CT-guided ablation of the tumor, a CT image will be performed  to evaluate dose response.  The 
ablation zone will then be resected  as part of the standard  surgical procedure  and the tissue specimen  will 
be examined  using histology  to determine  the completeness  of tumor ablation. 
 
 
 
 
This will be a post market prospective,  non-randomized,  single-arm, multicenter  study. 
Ablations  will be carried out using a percutaneous  approach  at a dose (power and time setting) selected 
during procedure  planning.  The procedure  planning  application will be used as an adjunct planning tool. 
While the physician prescribes the dose, the Emprint™  Procedure  Planning  Application overlays the 3- 
dimensional predicted  ablation zone on the patient CT images, facilitating visualization of the predicted  
ablation zone relative to the target tumor. Once the ablation procedure  is complete,  the scheduled  
surgical tumor resection will be performed.  
 
 
 
No formal sample size estimates were conducted  for this post-market, prospective,  non-randomized,  6. Determination of  Sample Size 5. Investigation Plan  4. Study Objectives  3. Introduction

 single-arm, multicenter  study. Up to 30 subjects who are scheduled for resection of metastatic  or 
primary lung tumor(s)  will be enrolled.  Ablations will be carried out using a percutaneous  approach  at a 
dose (power and time setting) selected during procedure  planning.  Up to 10 study sites in the United 
States and Europe will participate in this trial. 
 
 
 
7.1. Study Subjects  
7.1.1. Disposition  of Subjects  
Subject disposition (e.g., number completing the study, number lost-to-follow-up) will be summarized  
with frequency  tables. The following information will be provided  by study site: 
• Number and percentage  of screen failures 
• Number and percentage  of enrolled subjects 
• Number and percentage  of subjects who have completed  the Emprint™  ablation procedure  
• Number and percentage  of subjects who have completed  the Emprint™  ablation procedure  and 
the Primary Endpoint  
• Number and percentage  of subjects who have completed  the Emprint™  ablation procedure  and 
the Secondary  Endpoint  
• Number and percentage  of subjects who have completed  the postoperative evaluation / end of 
study Visit 
• Number and percentage  of subjects who exited the study, overall and by study exit type 
 
7.1.2. Clinical Investigation  Plan (CIP) Deviations  
A CIP deviation  is defined as an event where the Investigator or study personnel  did not conduct 
the study according  to the CIP. Deviations  shall be reported regardless of whether medically justifiable or 
taken to protect the Subject in an emergency.  
 
Except a change that is intended  to eliminate an immediate hazard to a Subject, the protocol will be 
followed as described.  Subject specific deviations and non-Subject specific deviations  will be reported.  
Investigators will also adhere to procedures  for reporting study deviations to their IRB in accordance  with 
their specific IRB reporting policies and procedures.  
 
7.1.3. Analysis Sets  
In general, data analysis will be conducted  on all subjects who are enrolled in the trial and undergo the 
ablation procedure  using the Emprint™  system. 
Intent-To-Treat (ITT): subjects enrolled into the study. 
 
Modified ITT (MITT): ITT subjects who completed  the ablation procedure.  If all ITT subjects completed  
the ablation procedure,  then the ITT population is the same as the MITT population.  
Additional  analysis sub-populations  may be defined per scientific research  need. 7. Statistical  Methods

7.2. General  Methodology  
Descriptive  statistics will be generated  for pre-intervention  demographics,  procedural  characteristics,  and 
follow-up data collected.  Categorical  variables will be analyzed  using frequency,  incidence,  and event 
rate. For continuous  variables collected in the study, data will be summarized  using mean, median, 
standard  deviation, and range. 
 
7.3. Center Pooling 
This is a multi-center clinical study, with standardization of subject enrollment,  data entry and adverse 
event reporting.  All investigational sites will follow the requirements  of a common  protocol,  data 
collection procedures and forms. 30 subjects will be enrolled from up to 10 clinical sites, all the data will 
be pooled for reporting . 
 
7.4. Handling of Missing  Data and Dropouts  
Handling  of dropouts  and missing data will depend on their frequency  and the nature of the outcome  
measure.  
When calculating rates of adverse events, missing and partial dates will be handled as follows. If the 
entire adverse event start date is missing then the procedure  date will be used for the start date. If the 
month and the day of the month are missing but the year is available and the year is the same as the 
year of the procedure  then the procedure  date will be used for the start date. If the year is greater than  
the year of the procedure  then January 1st will be used for the month and day of the start date. If the 
day is missing, but the month and year are available, then  the 1st will be used as the day of the start date  
unless the imputed date would before the procedure  in which case the procedure  date will be used for 
the start date of the adverse event. 
For baseline ca tegorical variables, “unknown” responses will be counted as not having the characteristic  
and will be included in the denominator.  Missing values will not be counted in rate denominators.  
 
7.5. Adjustments  for Multiple  Comparisons  
Not applicable since no statistical test will be performed  on the primary or secondary endpoint.  
 
7.6. Demographic  and Other Baseline  Characteristics  
Continuous  variables will be summarized  with number of subjects (n), mean, standard  deviation,  median, 
and ranges. The frequency  distributions  (counts and percentages)  will be given for categorical  data.

 If the “Evidence  of Complete  Ablation”  is checked No and the “If No, Was Delayed Necrosis 
Achieved”  is checked Yes, it is delayed necrosis 
 If the “Evidence  of Complete  Ablation”  is checked No and the “If No, Was Delayed Necrosis 
Achieved”  is checked No, it is incomplete tumor ablation 
 
The histology data for the H&E assay is from the H&E Sample Analysis – Part 2 of the PATHOLOGY  CRF: 
 If the “Evidence  of Complete  Ablation”  is checked Yes, it is complete  tumor ablation

ABSTRACT
 
 
Background
The
overall
objective
of
our
work
is
to
develop
therapy
for
obesity
and
diabetes
that
is
as
effective
as
gastric
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bypass
surgery
but
without
the
cost
and
safety
concerns.
Gastric
bypass
leads
to
rapid,
sustained
diabetes
remission
in
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
majority
of
patients
who
undergo
this
procedure
and
is
also
highly
effective
therapy
for
obesity.
However
currently
<1%
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
medically-eligible
patients
undergo
this
or
other
bariatric
operations
due
to
cost
and
safety
concerns.
Our
approach
is
based
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on
data
suggesting
that
the
benefit
of
gastric
bypass
is
largely
due
to
anatomical
rearrangement
of
the
intestine
which
leads
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
accelerated
delivery
of
nutrients
to
the
jejunum.
This
rerouting
of
nutrients
stimulates
the
release
of
multiple
neural,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hormonal and enterokine responses that are associated with appetite suppression and improved glucose control.
 
 
In
this
proof-of-concept
pilot
proposal
we
are
asking
the
question:
can
repeated
rapid
delivery
of
a
mixed
meal
directly
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the jejunum promote weight loss and blood glucose control?
 
 
Hypothesis:
Administration
of
intermittent
mixed
meal
bolus
daily
via
jejunal
tube
over
a
2
week
period
leads
to
weight
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
loss and improved glycemic control that is associated with reduced food intake and is sustained for 2 weeks of follow up.
 
Specific Aims:
​
 In obese, ambulatory, adult patients with type 2 diabetes receiving mixed meal (intervention) or electrolyte
 
solution (control) boluses daily via jejunal tube for 14 days, with 14 days follow up and with other oral nutrition permitted
 
throughout, to compare the following:
 
 
Primary aim: weight change immediately following the intervention period between the study groups
 
Secondary aims to compare the following within and between groups: From Day 0 to Day 14: caloric intake (as determined
 
by consumption of provided food), From Day 0 to Day 14: weight change (within group),From Day 0 to Day 28: weight
 
change From Day 0 to Day 14 and also from Day 0 to Day 28: waist and hip measurement, hormones and biochemical
 
measures, physical activity , body composition , symptoms, medication use, average self-monitored blood glucose level

Statistics
​
This
is
a
pilot
study
and
sample
size
estimates
are
not
appropriate.
However
based
on
studies
of
dietary
restriction
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with
a
1250
kcal
diet
for
1
week
we
anticipate
identifying
a
significantly
greater
weight
loss
in
the
intervention
arm
with
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sample size of 10 subjects/group. Fifteen subjects/group will be enrolled to allow for drop-outs.
 
 
Analysis:
Primary
analysis
will
be
to
compare
change
from
baseline
in
outcome
measures
between
the
2
groups
using
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
paired t-test. SC CTSI Biostatistics Department has aided in the study design.

BACKGROUND
​
 AND HYPOTHESES
 
 
More
than
two-thirds
(69%)
of
US
adults
are
overweight,
with
more
than
36%
obese
and
more
than
6%
having
morbid
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
obesity.
[
​

​
]
​
Over
80%
of
type
2
diabetes
is
attributed
to
excess
weight
and
obesity,[
​
2
​
]
​
but
safe,
effective,
low-cost
treatment
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is
not
available.
​
Failure
to
control
obesity
underlies
the
increasing
cost
of
diabetes
care
in
the
US
which
rose
by
41%
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from
2007
to
$245
billion
in
2012.[
​

​
]
Most
of
the
cost
of
care
(62%)
is
provided
by
government
insurance.[
​
3
​
]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmaceutical
therapy
has
proven
disappointing
for
management
of
obesity:
it
is
relatively
ineffective,
associated
with
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
severe side-effects and expensive.
 
 
 
Various
bariatric
surgical
procedures
are
highly
effective
at
inducing
weight
loss
and
lead
to
drug-free
remission
in
40-90%
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
patients.

However
a
recent
US
study
​
[

​
]
of
29,820
Blue
Shield
plan
members
who
underwent
bariatric
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
surgery
(at
a
cost
of
over
$28,000/procedure)
and
a
comparison
group
of
persons
not
undergoing
surgery
but
with
diagnoses
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
closely
associated
with
obesity
found
​
no
reduction
in
overall
health
care
costs
with
surgery
during
a
6-year
follow-up
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
period.
This
was
due
to
high
inpatient
costs
that
were
not
offset
by
a
reduction
in
office
visits
and
prescription
medications.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bariatric
surgery
is
not
available
to
the
vast
majority
of
the
world’s
population
who
might
benefit
from
it,
including
low
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
income
individuals,
the
young,
the
elderly
and
those
with
early
or
mild
disease.
D
​
ue
to
concerns
about
short
and
long
term
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
risk,
surgery
is
generally
limited
to
adults
with
complicated
obesity
and
a
BMI
of
​
>
​
35kg/m2,
or
severe
obesity
with
a
BMI
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
​
>
​
40kg/m

​
Furthermore
many
individuals
elect
not
to
undergo
bariatric
surgery
for
a
variety
of
reasons
that
include
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concerns
about
the
risks,
unwillingness
to
undergo
an
irreversible
procedure
and
the
belief
that
their
obesity
does
not
justify
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the intervention.
 
 
 
There is thus an unmet clinical need for a safe, low-cost alternative to bariatric surgery.
 
 
 
 
 
Background Physiology
 
 
 
Sustained
weight
loss
is
seen
in
the
majority
of
patients
undergoing
gastric
bypass
surgery
(GB).
The
amount
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sustainability
of
the
weight
loss
is
far
superior
to
that
achieved
by
current
pharmacological
and
lifestyle
treatments.[

Contrary
to
earlier
beliefs,
mechanical
restriction
of
food
intake
and
malabsorption
are
now
not
considered
to
be
major
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mediators
of
benefit.
It
is
now
widely
accepted
that
following
GB
there
is
rapid
increase
in
satiety
that
is
likely
mediated
by

several
different
mechanisms,
with
neurohormonal
signaling
and
enterokines
playing
a
central
role.[
​
10
​
]
​
Over
100
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enterokines
(i.e.
enteric
hormones
and
other
factors
such
as
bile
acids
with
systemic
metabolic
effects)
help
regulate
energy
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
balance.
The
enterokine
GLP-1
is
considered
to
be
a
major
contributor
to
benefit.
It
is
normally
secreted
by
intestinal
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
L-cells
in
response
to
nutrient
ingestion,
and
has
multiple
appetite
suppressing
and
glucose-lowering
actions
including
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
promotion
of
insulin
secretion,
inhibition
of
glucagon,
slowing
of
gastric
emptying,
portal-sensor/vagally
mediated
central
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
actions,
and
in
animals
at
least,
promotion
of
pancreatic-beta
cell
regeneration.
In
post-operative
GB
patients,
the
GLP-1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
response
to
oral
glucose
or
a
standard
meal
increases
4-6-fold.[
​
11
​
]
​
A
second
hormone
of
particular
interest
is
PYY
which
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
co-secreted
with
GLP-1
also
in
response
to
nutrients,
promotes
satiety
and
is
markedly
increased
following
GB.[
​
12
​
]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Changes
occur
rapidly:
Dirksen
et
al
reported
that
in
a
post-GB
patient
with
type
2
diabetes
glucose
tolerance
improved
or
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
worsened
on
successive
days
by
feeding
the
patient
by
mouth
or
via
a
gastrostomy
tube
respectively[
​
13
​
]
Falken
et
al
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
showed significant changes in enterokines, glucose tolerance and satiety 3 days post GB.[
​
14
​
]
 
 
 
Studies
in
patients
undergoing
GB
have
identified
a
distinctive
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
synergistic
cascade
of
appetite-suppressing
and
 
 
 
 
 
glucose-lowering
responses
triggered
by
delivery
of
food
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
directly
to
the
jejunum.

a

A
simple
nasojejunal
feeding
tube
(NJT)
is
similar
in
many
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ways
to
gastric
bypass
as
it
also
leads
to
nutrient
bypass
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the foregut and delivery directly to the jejunum. (Fig 3)
 
 
 
In
this
study
we
propose
evaluating
proof
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concept
that
rapid
delivery
of
nutrients
directly
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
jejunum
promotes
weight
loss
and
glucose
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
control
that
is
superior
to
that
seen
when
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
non-nutrient liquid is delivered to the jejunum.
 
 
Proof
of
concept
would
justify
the
development
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
methods
to
allow
direct
delivery
of
bolus
nutrient
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the jejunum that could be an alternative, lower cost, reversible alternative to GB surgery.
 
 
Preliminary Data
 
 
In
late
2012
we
initiated
pioneering
human
proof-of-concept
studies
of
our
hypothesis
that
delivery
of
nutrients
directly
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
the
jejunum
with
standard
NJT
simulates
the
actions
of
GB.
To
our
knowledge
we
are
the
first
investigators
to
use
the

Tube and Non-Nutrient Liquid May Alter Oral Food Intake
 
Rolls and Roe[
​
23
​
] reported in a study of 54 lean and obese women that 
​
the volume of liquid food infused
 
intragastrically affected subsequent energy intake in both lean and obese women. There was a mean decrease
 
in energy intake of a subsequent meal of 13% after a 400-ml preload compared with an iso-energetic 200-ml
 
preload (P=.013). 
​
For this reason a controlled study should include a tube and non-nutrient liquid administration.
 
 
 
How jejunal feeding in this study differs from that used for standard jejunal feeding
 
Jejunal
feeding
is
used
in
ambulatory
and
hospitalized
patients
to
provide
nutrition
when
this
cannot
be
taken
by
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
standard
gastric
route,
or
as
a
choice
by
the
physician
to
minimize
reflux
associated
with
gastric
feeding,
usually
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
semiconscious
or
critically
ill
patients.
In
such
cases
it
is
well
accepted
standard
care
that
the
tube
feeds
should
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
started
slowly
and
often
given
at
a
slow
rate
around
the
clock
in
order
to
achieve
target
caloric
and
nutritional
intake.[

It
is
frequently
reported
that
jejunal
feeds
are
“poorly
tolerated”.
Interpretation
of
the
effect
of
jejunal
feeds
on
weight
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
complicated
by
the
underlying
need
for
the
jejunal
feeds
which
includes
conditions
such
as
pancreatic
cancer,
pancreatitis
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
gastroparesis.
A
key
difference
in
the
approach
proposed
in
this
study
is
the
administration
of
bolus
feeds
at
a
far
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
higher
rate
than
normally
given
during
standard
feeding
protocol
with
the
express
intention
of
inducing
a
satiated
state
at
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
low caloric intake.

How Jejunal Feeding differs from the ketogenic enteric nutrition or “Bride Diet “and other low calorie diets
 
Low
and
very
low
calorie
diets,
if
sustained,
lead
to
weight
loss.
This
is
often
associated
with
a
lack
of
hunger
during
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
low
calorie
intake
period
that
may
be
due
to
the
induction
of
ketosis
and
ghrelin
suppression.[
​
25
​
]
In
general
weight
loss
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
following
caloric
restriction
is
not
sustained
and
short-term
metabolic
gains
dissipate.[
​
16
​
]
This
has
been
attributed
to
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
body’s
attempt
to
regain
its
previous
weight
with
resumption
of
a
non-restricted
intake.
The
superior
sustained
weight
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
loss
seen
with
GB
may
be
due
to
neurohormonal
signaling
of
an
“overfed”
state
during
the
low
calorie
phase
leading
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
defense
of
the
lower
weight
once
the
intervention
is
withdrawn.
We
aim
to
simulate
this
“fed”
response
with
jejunal
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
feeding.
 
 
With
respect
to
the
ketogenic
enteric
nutrition
diet,
this
200-260kcal/day
diet
induces
ketosis
during
a
continuous
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
administration
of
primarily
protein
into
the
stomach.
This
strategy
is
reported
to
minimize
protein
catabolism
during
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
diet.
The
intragastric
continuous
infusion
is
distinct
from
the
jejunal
bolus
approach
we
propose.
The
diet
is
of
interest
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
us
however
as
it
demonstrates
the
safety
and
acceptability
of
ambulatory
tube
use
for
weight
loss.
A
report
by
Cappello

lose
about
3%
of

​
An
average
deficit
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
500 kcal/day should
result
in
an
initial
weight
loss
of
approximately
0.5 kg/week (1 lb/week).[

​
Weight
loss
is
greater
in

those
with

weight.
However,
after
three

months
of

loss,
energy
expenditure
adaptations
occur
which
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
slow the bodyweight response to a given change in energy intake, thereby diminishing ongoing weight loss.[

Recruitment
​
 Information sessions and study materials will be provided to clinic physicians who may refer subjects from within the
 
LA County Healthcare Network to explain the study protocol. IRB approved flyers will be placed in approved recruitment
 
areas. In addition clinic providers will request permission from patients to forward their names and contact information to
 
the study recruiter if they meet eligibility criteria. If the patient agrees to have their name forwarded to the study team then
 
this will be documented in the permanent medical record. The study recruiter will contact potential subjects and describe
 
details of the study using an IRB script. If the potential subject remains interested in participating the PI and CoI will
 
follow-up with further discussion and review of the protocol with the potential subject. Participants will be provided with
 
diabetic education describing the signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia and their management. This will
 
be provided by the study doctor when the protocol is discussed with the potential subject and will be reviewed at each
 
subsequent visit.
 
 
​
Approved illustrations of the proposed intervention as well as the informed consent will be provided to the potential
 
subject and they will be allowed to review this in their own time. All questions will be addressed by the PI and CoI
 
before consent is signed.

stands
on
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
scale-like
device
while
grasping
two
handles
–
one
in
each
hand.
The
device
works
by
sending
a
very
low
voltage
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
electrical
signal
through
the

for up to 2 weeks at a time without need for any adjustment be the wearer.
 
 
Body weight will be measured in the morning on a calibrated scale with the subject wearing light clothing. 
​
Waist
 
circumference will be measured by wrapping a flexible measuring tape around the narrowest point of the
 
midsection. The tape will be kept parallel to the floor. Hip circumference will be measured by wrapping a flexible
 
tape around the hips at the widest diameter of the buttocks. The tape will be kept parallel to the floor. The
 
waist-to-hip ratio will be determined by taking the waist circumference and dividing by the hip circumference.
 
 
Subjects
will
have
a

feeds would only start when the tube is shown to be in the correct position.
 
 
Subjects will be provided with detailed instructions and logs for the following: (See Appendix B: Subject Packet).
 
 
1. Bolus nutrient administration and flushing of tube
 
2. Eating: to eat ad lib from provided meals of known caloric amount
 
3. Daily self-monitoring and tube care
 
 
4. 24 hour contact information
 
5. Need to monitor blood glucose prior to tube bolus
 
6. Use of FitBit activity monitor and daily activity
 
Prior
to
leaving,
the

understanding
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
requirements for the study.
 
 
▪
Day 0-Day 14: (see Table 3)
 
▪
Intervention subjects will take mixed meal via jejunal tube at 10mls/min to satiety or to a maximum volume of
 
200mls 4 times a day. They will also take 200mls electrolyte solution 4 times daily orally.
 
 
▪
Control subjects will take electrolyte solution via jejunal tube at 10mls/min to satiety or to a maximum volume of
 
200mls 4 times a day. They will also take 200mls mixed meal solution 4 times daily orally.
 
▪
If for any reason the tube feed cannot be administered the remainder should be taken orally to ensure
 
recommended daily intake of major nutrients and fluid is achieved.
 
▪
In addition all subjects will take the following daily:  2 10meq potassium chloride tablets, 2 600mg calcium tablets
 
and 1 multivitamin tablet daily and 1/2tsp salt.
 
▪
In addition all subjects will be requested to eat ad lib from provided meals of known caloric amount.
 
 
▪
All subjects may also eat ad lib from very low or calorie “free” foods and drinks throughout the study from a
 
provided list.
 
▪
 Subjects will maintain a log of all food intake will check their daily temperature, tube position and symptoms and
 
will contact the study team for specified symptoms or if they have any concerns they would like addressed.
 
 
▪
As subjects adhering to very low-calorie diets usually have a fall in blood pressure, especially during the first week
 
antihypertensive drugs will be discontinued unless moderate to severe hypertension is present.[
​
33
​

Ver 3.11.14
 
 
▪
Subjects will be requested to be as physically active as they like. Thus they are at liberty to increase, decrease or
 
maintain their usual activity level.
 
▪
 Similarly as most diabetic patients eating very low-calorie diets have marked improvement in hyperglycemia with
 
blood glucose concentrations falling within the first one to two weeks oral hypoglycemic drugs will be
 
discontinued for the first week of therapy. [
​
33
​
] An increase in activity level may also cause a fall in blood glucose
 
levels. To aid in maintaining safe blood glucose levels subjects will be required to report to the study team if their
 
blood glucose is over 250mg/dl on more than 2 consecutive measures or any value over 300mg/dl or  less than
 
70mg/dl on any occasion. Symptoms of hypoglycemia (sweating, weakness, palpitations, confusion) will be
 
reviewed with the participant at each visit. They will be advised to check their blood glucose if possible if such
 
symptoms occur and to take one 15g glucose tablet (to be carried at all times) and repeat this every 15minutes until
 
self-monitored blood glucose is over 80mg/dL or symptoms resolve.

 2 ENTERAL ACCESS SYSTEM (EAS™) 
​
[
​
35-41
​
]
 
 
This system is FDA cleared for placement of enteral feeding tubes without x-ray confirmation. A transmitting stylet is used
 
to place the enteral tube. The tip of the stylet contains an electromagnetic transmitter that generates a real-time signal as the
 
feeding tube is inserted and advanced to the desired placement. The signal from the transmitting stylet is tracked throughout
 
the placement procedure via a lightweight receiver unit (Smart Receiver Unit: SRU) that is placed on the patient’s xiphoid
 
process. A monitor triangulates the signal from the SRU and displays a real-time representation of the feeding tube tip’s
 
passage as it proceeds down the esophagus and into the preferred placement position — gastric, duodenal, or jejunal. (See
 
Fig 6)

Intraoral Anchor (see Fig 7)
 
For the purposes of this study we will secure the tube intraorally rather than through the nasopharynx to the skin.
 
The rationale for this is:
 
a.
To minimize discomfort to the subject due to placement of the tube through the sensitive nasopharynx
 
b.
To eliminate the risk of complications in the nasopharynx such as nose bleed, sinusitis and malposition
 
c.
To improve social acceptability of the study by rendering the tube inapparent to the casual observer.
 
d.
To simplify tube maintenance by avoiding the need for taping or other means of securing the tube externally.
 
To achieve this we will:
 
12
 
 
Ver 3.11.14
 
 
a.
Modify a standard orthodontic molar band on an upper molar with the addition of a metal channel to anchor the
 
tube in the mouth. The channel is welded to the buccal surface of the band.
 
b.
Place standard orthodontic spacers following standard orthodontic procedure on either side of the selected molar
 
c.
Approximately 1 week later place the modified molar band
 
d.
Modify a standard CORPAK enteral feeding tube by cutting off the access port and leaving only an approximately
 
4mm flange
 
e.
Pass the tube through the channel in the alert subject so that the tube passes through the lateral oropharynx and
 
then, by standard placement technique, to the jejunum
 
f.
Fashion an integrated tube cap to close the tube when not in use
 
g.
Provide a syringe with a blunt tapered tip to administer fluids per protocol.
 
 
Fig 7
 
 
This modification of standard placement and anchoring of the tube has been reviewed and evaluated by multidisciplinary
 
study team members comprising a bioengineer, orthodontists, ENT specialist and upper GI surgeon and endoscopist who
 
report:
 
a.
The flange is strong enough to hold the tube at the proximal end of the channel as it is 
​
solvent bonded/glued per
 
the manufacturers 
​
and will not deform or detach thereby rendering the risk of distal displacement extremely low.
 
Per scientific adviser Professor Khoshnevis: “
​
Because the access port is solvent bonded to the tube and both the
 
tube and the access port are made of a reasonably strong polymer material, the chance of the tube ever being
 
released from the oral anchor due to its separation from the access port segment is nearly zero. Using solvent is
 
perhaps the best way of adhering parts made of materials that can be dissolved by the solvent agent as the adhered
 
components become monolithic.”(Personal and email communication).
 
b.
The modified molar band is a minor variant of a standard orthodontic molar band and is very secure and similarly
 
renders the risk of distal displacement of the tube extremely low.
 
c.
The tube position in the oropharynx is lateral to sites triggering the gag reflex and allows for virtually normal
 
speech, swallowing and eating with minimal or no gagging and is virtually undetectable by others.
 
d.
Some discomfort and mild pain (maximum ~4 out of 10) can be expected mostly in the first 4-5days of use. This
 
can be eased with several maneuvers including change of body position and acetaminophen in standard dose.
 
e.
The discomfort and pain can be expected to be minimal after the first 5 days such that the subject is barely aware
 
of the tube’s presence.
 
f.
There is minimal risk of throat or gastrointestinal complications with a 10 French jejunal tube placed in the
 
described manner and for duration of 2 weeks.

ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY AND SAFETY
 
 
Safety of this study plan has been reviewed with the multidisciplinary team and by review of relevant literature.
 
 
Steps taken to minimize potential risks are summarized in table 4.
 
 
The
following
study
team
members,
who
are
all
USC
faculty
members
have
evaluated
aspects
of
this
protocol
related
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
their area of expertise and have concluded that this is a low risk study, with potential benefit outweighing possible harm.
 
 
Specifically:
 
a.
Stability and safety of oral anchor: Orthodontists: Dr Hongsheng Tong DDS and Dr John Pham DDS (resident)
 
b.
Stability of orojejunal tube in anchor: Bioengineer Professor Behrokh Khoshnevis PhD
 
c.
Safety of orojejunal tube in oropharynx: ENT: Dr Uttam Sinha MD

Oropharyngeal Care with Anchor and Tube In-Situ
 
Standard care as used following placement of orthodontic braces will be recommended. Subjects will be advised to brush and floss
 
their teeth after every meal. Complications are not anticipated even in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Acetaminophen liquid
 
may be taken in standard doses if needed to decrease tube discomfort.
 
 
The anchors will be manufactured in-house by Dr Tong using medical-grade orthodontic materials. The anchor will be bonded to the
 
molar using fluoride containing cement to minimize the unlikely possibility of dental decay. The anchors will be placed and
 
removed by the study team orthodontists.
 
It is considered highly unlikely that infection will develop due to use of the tube anywhere along its path. If fever develops for any
 
reason however, whether considered due to the intervention per se or to intercurrent illness, the subject will be removed
 
from the study.
 
 
Very Low Calorie and Low Calorie Tube Feeds
 
Cappello et al [
​
26
​
] reported on the use of a very low calorie nasogastric tube feed diet (200-260 kcal/d) for 10 day periods with no
 
14
 
 
Ver 3.11.14
 
 
serious complications in a group of over 19,000 people. The problems encountered were damage to the external part of the
 
tube (e.g. shaving) 2%, “gastric hypersecretion” (nos) 2%, nausea and vomiting 1%, and intolerance to the nasal tube
 
0.03%. The following were not observed: ulceration or bleeding due to the tube, b
​
reakage of the tube in esophagus or
 
in the
​
 stomach, p
​
erforation or bleeding of the stomach.  Sukkar et al [
​
42
​
] in another similar smaller study reported
 
on 22 
​
patients who received 10 days of 
​
very low calorie nasogastric tube feeds (200-260 kcal/d). Subjects 
​
were monitored
 
for the
​
 
​
following side effects relating to enteral nutrition (abdominal
​
 
​
distension and pain, diarrhea, vomiting, reflux,
 
naso-gastric
​
, 
​
tube obstruction, de-positioning or accidental removal of the
​
 
​
naso-gastric tube, others) and those related to the
 
very low calorie/high protein diet (cardiac arrhythmia, ketosis, hypoglycemia, others). Out of 26 patients enrolled, 3
 
patients (9 %) were withdrawn due to poor compliance and 1 (3 %) for allergy to milk protein. Of the remaining 22 subjects
 
there were no reported major complications or side effects resulting from the enteral nutrition in any patient. In particular,
 
no cardiac arrhythmias were reported, nor diarrhea or cramps. The following were reported: constipation (3/22; 13.6 %),
 
dizziness or headache during the first 2 days [20/22; 90.9 % (only two needed medication)], general weakness (3/22; 13.6
 
%), halitosis (5/22; 22.7 %) controlled by sugarless mint chewing-gum. The naso-gastric tube was blocked in 3 patients and
 
required repositioning.
 
 
 
Enteral Feeding Tube Placement
 
Although
enteral
tube
placement
is
a
common
clinical
practice
and
is
performed
by
lay
individuals
in
the
home
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
environment
when
necessary,
it
has
been
associated
with
serious
complications
including
malposition
into
the
airway,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
perforation
of
the
trachea
and
esophagus
and
pneumothorax.
These
complications
occur
almost
exclusively
during
blind
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
intubation
in
sedated,
unconscious
or
otherwise
poorly
responsive
patients
and
neonates
and
when
the
tube
is
placed
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
through
the
nasopharynx.
In
this
study
we
will
use
the
EAS
​
TM
system
and
CORTRAK
tubes
which
have
demonstrated
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
greater
safety
than
standard
blind
placement
due
to
real
time
visualization
during
placements.
Tubes
will
be
placed
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
following
manufacturer’s
recommended
procedure
to
minimize
risk.
Furthermore
all
subjects
will
be
fully
alert
throughout
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
procedure
and
able
to
interact
with
the
trained
investigator
who
is
placing
the
tube;
tubes
will
be
placed
by
the
oral
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
route
with
a
“swallow
down”
placement
technique
rather
than
a
“push”
technique.
These
precautions
can
be
expected
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
minimize
the
already
very
low
rate
of
complications
that
can
arise
during
tube
placement,
making
a
serious
problem
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
extremely
unlikely.
Aspiration
of
stomach
contents
may
occur
if
the
subject
has
not
fasted
prior
to
tube
placement.
If
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enquiry
the
subject
has
not
fasted
then
the
test
will
be
cancelled.
Blind
intubation
requires
x-ray
confirmation
prior
to
tube
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
use
to
minimize
complications
related
to
tube
misplacement
however
the
EAS
​
TM
system
is
FDA
approved
to
not
require
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
x-ray confirmation of placement thereby avoiding risks associated with radiation. [

Ambulatory
Use
of
Jejunal
Tube
for
14
Days
Nasal
and
oral

for

are
standard
accepted

for
subjects
requiring
nutritional
support
up
to
30
days.
​
The
American
Gastroenterological
Society
recommends
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
consideration
be
given
to
replacing
a
naso

Although
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
not
currently
widely
accepted
as
medical
therapy,
the
ketogenic

Although
the
underlying
physiological
approach
that
we
are
hypothesizing
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
markedly
different
to
this
diet,
it
does
demonstrate
that
use
of
enteral
tubes
for
10
days
is
feasible
and
acceptable
to
many

tube

the

Subjects
in

more
closely

practice.
Some
discomfort
can
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
expected
to
occur
in
the
throat
due
to
the
tube
and
may
be
relieved
by
slight
relocation
of
the
tube
to
relieve
pressure

overall
body
repositioning

to
decrease
after
4-5
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
days
of
use.
Acetaminophen
will

offered
to
subjects
for
use
if
desired.
If
fever
develops
suggestive
of
local
infection
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
then

Inadvertent Dislodgement of the Tube
 
Enteral
feeding
tubes
not
infrequently
become
accidentally
dislodged
in
general
use.
This
is
considered
highly
unlikely
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cause
problems
in
this
study
as
the
tube
will
be
anchored
entirely
intraorally.
Most
displacement
is
due
to
inadvertent
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pulling
on
the
extracorporeal
part
of
the
tube
by
a
sedated
or
otherwise
confused
patient,
or
failure
of
tape
to
maintain
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
position
of
the
tube.
If
the
tube
were
to
slip
through
the
anchor
it
is
anticipated
that
it
would
pass
directly
through
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gastrointestinal
tract.
Per
co-investigator
Dr.
Peter
Crookes
a
tube
that
becomes
dislodged
and
is
swallowed
will
almost
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
certainly
pass
spontaneously
through
the
intestinal
tract
as
long
as
there
are
no
abnormalities
in
the
intestine
such
as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adhesions
or
strictures
and
the
chance
of
the
tube
being
retained
and
requiring
endoscopic
or
surgical
removal
is
so
low
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
it
does
not
need
to
be
mentioned
as
a
risk
to
subjects.
We
will
exclude
all
subjects
with
a
history
of
abdominal
infections
or
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
surgeries or other illnesses that could lead to strictures or adhesions.

The following table and figure from Nazir et al [

] summarizes this information and provides data that the molar
 
band is a very secure system especially in the short term as used in this study.
 
 
 
 
 
Ensuring participants won’t chew through the tube if they have bruxism
 
 
The
tube
anchor
is
located
on
the
upper
posterior
buccal
molar.
The
140cm
tube
immediately
passes
backwards
from
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
anchor
to
the
lateral
oropharynx
where
it
descends
straight
down
into
the
gastrointestinal
tract.
It
is
maintained
in
this
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
position
by
gravity
and
peristalsis.
The
tube
is
thus
unable
to
move
medially
across
the
occlusal
surface
of
the
teeth
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hence bruxism does not pose a risk.

Mouth guards
 
Participants
are
not
required
to
wear
a
mouth
guard
either
while
awake
or
asleep
as
the

is
positioned
well
lateral

posterior occlusal surfaces of the teeth.
 
 
Precautions to be taken to prevent the tube being accidentally swallowed
 
The following precautions will be taken to decrease the chance that the tube will be accidentally swallowed:
 
Participants
will
be
asked
to
monitor
for
any
loosening
of
the
molar
band
daily
and
also
to
monitor
for
any
evidence
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
abrasion
or
wear
on
the
intraoral
portion
of
the
tube.
They
will
do
this
by
checking
that
the
band
is
secure
manually
and
by
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
looking
for
wear
on
the
tube
when
it
is
brought
slightly
forward
to
be
attached
to
the
syringe
for
each
tube
feeding.
They
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
will
be
requested
to
report
any
concerns
in
this
regard
to
the
study
team
as
soon
as
it
is
detected.
They
will
also
be
told
how
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
remove
the
band
or
tube
if
it
should
become
so
loose
or
worn
that
it
could
dislodge
spontaneously.
Furthermore
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
decrease risk of the band becoming dislodged the band will be kept in place for as short a period as possible.
 
 
 
Procedure if the tube is accidentally swallowed and how it will be retrieved.
 
 
The
risk
of
accidental
swallowing
of
the
tube
is
considered
to
be
extremely
remote
due
to
the
precautions
taken
in
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
design
of
the
anchor
and
tube
as
described
above.

the
tube
is
accidentally
swallowed
the
participant

conservative

can
be
expected
within
4–6
days.
Rare
cases
have
been
reported
where
it
has
taken
up
to
4
weeks
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pass
a
foreign
object.
Until
the
tube
has
passed,
the
participant
will
be
asked
to
monitor
their
stools
continuously.
No
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
change
in
eating
behavior
will
be
required
during
this
period.
If
the
tube
is
not
passed
after
about
1
week
then
weekly
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
outpatient
x-ray
examination
will
likely
be
recommended
in
order
to
document,
the
foreign
body’s
passage.
As
the
tube
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
radiopaque its passage can be documented
​
. 
​
(See product insert uploaded at iSTAR #18.2).
 
If
the
tube
does
not
pass
spontaneously
then
it
may
be
retrieved
by
Dr.
Crookes
or
Dr.
Buxbaum
using
upper
or
lower
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
endoscopy.
It
is
unlikely
that
emergency
esophagogastroduodenoscopy
(EGD)
will
be
required
as
this
is
recommended
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
when
the
esophagus
is
completely
occluded
(because
of
the
risk
of
aspiration
and/or
pressure
necrosis),
when
the
ingested
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
object
has
a
sharp
point
or
edge
(because
of
the
risk
of
perforation,
with
ensuing
mediastinitis
or
peritonitis),
and
when
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
battery
has
been
ingested
(because
of
the
risk
of
necrosis
and
fistula
formation)-none
of
which
can
reasonably
be
expected
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
occur
in
this
study.
Similarly
even
an
urgent
but
non-emergency
EGD
(within
12
to
24)
hours
is
unlikely
to
be
required
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as
this
is
recommended
for
non-occluding
esophageal
foreign
bodies
such
as
magnets.
Recovery
of
a
foreign
body
by
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
means
of
colonoscopy
is
not
common
practice
according
to
the
available
data
as
after
the
ileocecal
valve
has
been
passed
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the foreign body is usually excreted without any complications.
 
 
There
is
a
remote
possibility
that
surgery
(including
the
option
of
minimally
invasive
laparoscopic
surgery)
could
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
required
to
remove
the
tube.
This
has
become
progressively
more
unusual
as
endoscopic
retrieval
rates
improve.
The
only
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
absolute
indication
for
surgery
is
reported
to
be
perforation
which
is
highly
unlikely
to
occur
with
the
blunt
soft
tube.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Relative
indications
for
surgery
after
ingestion
of
foreign
bodies
exist
in
the
case
of
complications
that
cannot
be
resolved
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
endoscopically or after unsuccessful attempts at endoscopic recovery.
 
 
 
Data
to
support
claims
that
the
tube
will
almost
certainly
pass
spontaneously
through
the
intestinal
tract
without
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
any intestinal abnormalities
 
A
recent
review
by
Ambe
et
al
[
​
47
​
]summarizes
findings
from
numerous
articles
on
the
topic
of
ingested
foreign
bodies
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adult.
It
has
been
widely
reported
that
the
majority
of
foreign
bodies
in
the
gastrointestinal
tract
will
pass
spontaneously
but
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that
about
10-20%
will
require
non-operative
intervention
and
less
than
1%
will
require
surgery.
In
the
current
study,
in
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
very
unlikely
event
that
the
tube
were
to
be
accidentally
ingested,
the
rate
of
spontaneous
passage
can
be
expected
to
be
far
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
higher than 80%. The reasons for this are as follows:
 
a.
Impaction
most
often
occurs
at
areas
of
acute
angulation
or
physiologic
narrowing.
The
esophagus
is
the
most
frequent
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
site
of
blockage
(50–75%) because
of
physiological
narrowing
at
the
cricopharyngeal
sphincter,
the
aortic
arch
and
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
diaphragmatic
hiatus.
Other
relatively
narrow
and
angled
areas
are
the
duodenum
and
the
entrance
to
the
jejunum
at
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
Ligament
of
Treitz.
In
this
study
the
tube
will
be
placed
by
the
study
team
through
the
esophagus,
the
duodenum
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
17
 
 
Ver 3.11.14
 
 
and
beyond
the
ligament
of
Treitz
so
obstruction
at
these
levels
would
be
extremely
unlikely.
Once
through
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
esophagus, the majority of ingested foreign bodies pass through the alimentary tract uneventfully.
 
 
 
b.
Patients
with
prior
gastrointestinal
tract
surgery
or
congenital
gut
malformations
account
for
a
large
number
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
obstructions.
We
will
reduce
the
risk
of
obstruction
by
the
exclusion
criteria
of
a
history
of
abdominal
infections
or
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
surgeries or other illnesses that could lead to strictures or adhesions.
 
 
c.
The
participant
will
be
excluded
from
the
trial
if
the
tube
cannot
be
passed
through
the
esophagus,
stomach,
duodenum
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and jejunum initially, the commonest sites for impaction.
 
 
 
Daily Activities with Tube In-Situ
 
The
intra-oral
tube
placement
renders
it
inapparent
to
the
casual
observer.
This
allows
the
subject
to
avoid
embarrassment
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or
unwanted
explanations
due
to
tube
use
and
to
continue
with
routine
activities.
The
subject
may
experience
discomfort
or
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
some
anxiety
due
to
tube
placement
and
if
rapid
weight
loss
occurs,
may
experience
increased
fatigue.
As
this
is
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
voluntary
study
the
subject
will
have
made
an
informed
decision
to
have
a
tube
in-situ
for
2
weeks.
Where
possible,
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tube
will
be
placed
during
a
2
week
period
when
the
subject
will
be
able
to
adhere
to
the
study
routine
and
rest
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
appropriately.
Ease
of
mind
will
likely
be
increased
for
the
subject
by
knowing
that
at
any
time
they
desire
they
can
remove
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the tube themselves, withdraw from the study and/or contact the study team.
 
 
Symptoms due to Jejunal Nutrient Administration
 
Subjects
may
experience
dumping
symptoms
of
nausea,
palpitations,
sweating
and
abdominal
pain
during
or
for
about
1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hour
after
jejunal
nutrient
infusion.
The
dose
of
the
nutrient
administered
will
be
selected
by
the
subject
to
achieve
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
comfortable
satiety.
They
will
stop
administering
nutrient
if
they
experience
unpleasant
symptoms.
Symptoms,
if
they
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
occur
are
usually
mild
and
are
transient
and
self-limited.
We
will
exclude
potential
subjects
from
the
study
if
they
have
any
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
known
cardiovascular
disease
(other
than
controlled
hypertension)
to
minimize
potential
risks
to
the
subject
associated
with
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
possible palpitations in association with dumping syndrome.
 
 
Venipuncture
 
This study involves venipuncture of a peripheral vein. This is associated with a small risk of minor bleeding and infection at
 
the puncture site. To minimize this risk, aseptic precautions will be used.
 
 
 
Risk of Hypoglycemia or Hyperglycemia
 
Alteration in diet and physical activity could lead to alterations in blood glucose: both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.
 
To minimize the risk of these complications the following precautions will be made:
 
a.
All participants will have the symptoms and signs of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia reviewed
 
with them as well as recommended management at each visit starting with the recruitment visit
 
when the protocol is reviewed.
 
b.
As most diabetic patients eating very low-calorie diets have marked improvement in
 
hyperglycemia with blood glucose concentrations falling within the first one to two weeks oral
 
hypoglycemic drugs will be discontinued for the first week of therapy. [
​
33
​
] An increase in
 
activity level may also cause a fall in blood glucose levels. To aid in maintaining safe blood
 
glucose levels subjects will be required to report to the study team if their blood glucose is over
 
250mg/dl on more than 2 consecutive measures or any value is over 300mg/dl or  less than
 
70mg/dl on any occasion.
 
 
c.
Information on managing hypoglycemia is provided in the FREE TO GO Study Instructions
 
given to the participant.

Intraoral anchoring makes tube inapparent to observers.  They will be
 
encouraged to take acetaminophen and take other steps to decrease discomfort
 
of tube particularly in first few days of use. They will be shown how to
 
remove the tube themselves at any time if they so desire
 
Back-up in event of distal tube displacement
 
Senior bariatric surgeon on study team
 
Safety of very low calorie diet for 2 weeks in
 
subjects with type 2 diabetes
 
Close monitoring by specialist endocrinologist with adjustment of medication
 
if needed. All subjects can take food and liquid ad lib. Mandatory minimum
 
480 kcal/d; 1.6litres fluid/day; 100% RDA high quality protein; 100% RDA
 
electrolytes, minerals and vitamins.
 
Hyper- and Hypo-glycemia
 
Oral hypoglycemic drugs will be discontinued for the first week of therapy
 
and participants will contact the study team if their glucose levels are less
 
than 70mg/dL or over 250mg/dL.
 
Participants will be educated on the symptoms of hypo- and hyper- glycemia
 
and provided wth instruction and glucose tablets for the management of
 
hypoglycemia.

CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS
 
 
Primary aim: weight change immediately following the intervention period between the study groups
 
Secondary aims: to compare the following within and between groups:
 
 
a.
From Day 0 to Day 14: caloric intake (as determined by consumption of provided food)
 
 
b.
From Day 0 to Day 14: weight change (within group)
 
c.
From Day 0 to Day 28: weight change
 
 
d.
From Day 0 to Day 14 and also from Day 0 to Day 28: waist and hip measurement, hormones and

self-monitored blood glucose level
 
 
 
11.0
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
 
 
Samples will be collected by the PI or IRB approved research assistant from peripheral venipuncture.
 
The investigator will draw 20cc fasting blood at Day 0, 14 and 28 visits into a prepared tube containing aprotinin. This will
 
be kept on ice and centrifuged, separated and aliquoted within 30mins of blood draw. Samples will then be stored at -20
 
degrees centigrade until transferred on ice to collaborator for assay.
 
 
Study Costs: All costs for this study will be paid from study funds. There will be no patient care costs incurred for payment
 
from non-study funds. Costs covered by the study include study visits, supplies, equipment, blood draws, biochemical
 
analysis and subject reimbursement.
 
 
 
12.0
DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING
 
 
Confidentiality of Discussions:
​
 The privacy of the research subject will be protected by having discussions regarding the
 
study and confidential health matters in a private room in the Roybal CHC or by telephone from a private office.
 
Initial and follow-up Case Report Forms (CRF): 
​
All data will be entered on IRB approved clinical medical record forms.
 
All data will be kept in a locked cabinet in Dr Beale’s office when not in use.
 
Data Security and Confidentiality
​
 Data will only be accessible by the primary investigator and co-investigators and research
 
assistants for the purposes of the study. Data will be transcribed from the CRF to a non-network computer, password
 
protected, accessible only by the investigators for the purposes of the study. Each enrolled patient will be assigned a study
 
number and all data will be stored under this study number with no linkage to patient identifiers.  Data will also be stored
 
by Dr. Ionut in her computer protected computer database using a study specific identifier developed specifically for the
 
study. The computer is password protected and is in a room accessible only to the laboratory personnel. All personnel have
 
been HIPAA trained.
 
When the study is completed the data or data set will be maintained in a de-identified form on the PI’s computer. Identifiers
 
will be destroyed at the earliest opportunity consistent with the conduct of the research and/or clinical needs and will be
 
maintained no longer than 2 years after completion of the study.
 
 
Source Documentation and Timeliness of CRF Completion.
​
 The CRF will be completed by the research staff daily. Data
 
will be stored on REDCap.
 
 
Retention of Study Record:
​
 Study data will be retained for 5 years after publication. At this time or in case non-publication,
 
the data will be destroyed.
 
Data Management:
​
 Data will be recorded on clinic record forms and will be entered into a database system for subsequent
 
statistical analysis. Potential data errors will be detected by plotting frequency tables or histograms on outcome and
 
exposure variables and data ranges will be checked to identify potential outliers. The frequency of missing values will be
 
counted for each variable at each of the follow-up time points. Cross-tables will be used to verify the logical validity of
 
related variables.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
 
SC CTSI statisticians have provided assistance with study design. This is a pilot study. As such power studies are not
 
appropriate.  Effect sizes and parameter estimates derived from this study will be used in the design and power calculations
 
21
 
 
Ver 3.11.14
 
 
for future studies The primary aim is to compare weight change from Day 1 to Day 14 (the intervention period)  between
 
the 2 study groups.
 
 
The secondary aims are to compare the following between study groups:
 
 
a.
From Day 1 to Day 14: caloric intake
 
 
b.
From Day 1 to Day 28 (the intervention and follow-up period): Weight change
 
 
c.
From Day 1 to Day 14 and also from Day 1 to Day 28:
 
 
i.
waist and hip measurement,
 
ii.
 hormones and biochemical measures,
 
iii.
physical activity
 
 
iv.
body composition
 
 
v.
symptoms
 
vi.
medication
 
vii.
self-monitored blood glucose
 
Due to the exploratory nature of this study, it is possible that clinically relevant effects will be observed that do not reach
 
statistical significance. Nevertheless, based on the work of Lingvay et al[
​
27
​
] we could consider a 30% difference between
 
sites in weight loss between the groups to be clinically relevant.
 
 
Data will be presented as mean +/- S.E.M. Differences between groups will be analyzed by one-way ANOVA
 
followed by a Student’s t-test for independent samples. A non-parametric test (Wilcoxon Rank) will be performed
 
when appropriate. Change over time will be assessed with ANOVA for repeated measurements. In case of a
 
significant result a post hoc analysis will be performed with the Student’s ttest. All analyses will be performed
 
using SPSS for Windows Version 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).

Helpful Hints
 
1.
You should be able to carry on with your usual daily acitivties while the tube is in place. However you may
 
feel more tired than usual and have some pain or discomfort so you should try to get adequate rest.
 
2.
Some discomfort or pain can be expected when the tube is in place and this does not mean that you have a
 
serious problem or an infection. It will likely occur mostly in the first few days and after that you will likely
 
hardly be aware that the tube is in place. The discomfort or pain will often go away by itself or if you change
 
your position or move the tube a few centimeters. You can take Tylenol liquid to help with this.too. You may
 
find things that  relieve or worsen the discomfort. If you do, please document this in your log.
 
3.
Sometimes the tube gets kinked and you may not be able to give the tube feed. You can try to undo the kink
 
by pulling back on the tube up to about the length of your hand (about 6inches  or 15cms) and trying again.
 
4.
Sometimes the tube gets blocked with tube feed. This can be prevented by flushing the tube after every feed.
 
If you think the tube maybe blocked with feed you can try to unblock it by injecting water. You should not use
 
any other liquid to unblock the tube
 
5.
If you really do not want to have the tube in any more you can pull it out yourself. The tube is 140cm long.
 
All you have to do is gently and smoothly pull the tube out of the mouth.

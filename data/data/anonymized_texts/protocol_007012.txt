A1. Abstract  
The introduction of protease -inhibitor based antiretroviral therapy (PI -ART) has reduced the mortality 
associated with HIV infection (HIV+). Unfortunately, PI -ART use is a major risk factor for insulin 
resistance, an important risk factor for diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD). 
Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUD CA), a naturally occurring bile salt, improves insulin sensitivity in 
insulin resistant people who do not have HIV. We have found that TUDCA markedly ameliorates 
ritonavir -induced insulin resistance in human myotubes and mice. The mechanism(s) responsible for 
these TUDCA -induced metabolic improvements are unclear, but could be related to: 1) TGR5 receptor 
activation, which upregulates cellular factors in muscle, including type 2 deiodinase (which increases 
intracellular triiodothryonine) and PGC -1 that incr ease mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation 
and/or 2) acting as chaperones that reduce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by assisting protein 
folding. Initiation of ritonavir -boosted PI -ART worsens insulin sensitivity in HIV+ people and induces 
markers of ER stress in adipose tissue. We propose to perform a double -blind, randomized, controlled 
trial to determine if TUDCA improves insulin sensitivity in insulin -resistant, HIV+ people receiving PI -
ART and to clarify the molecular mechanisms respons ible for these improvements. We will randomly 
assign 48 insulin -resistant, HIV+ subjects to either placebo or TUDCA (1.75g/day x 30 days) and will 
measure multi -organ insulin sensitivity before and after the intervention by using a multistage 
hyperinsuline mic euglycemic clamp with infusion of stable isotope labeled tracers. To clarify the 
mechanisms responsible for the anticipated improvements in insulin sensitivity, we will examine the 
effect of TUDCA on TGR5 activation (type 2 deiodinase expression) in sk eletal muscle biopsies and on 
ER stress by measuring Grp78 in adipose tissue biopsies taken before and after TUDCA 
administration. The results from this study will determine not only whether TUDCA may be effective for 
treatment of PI -associated insulin res istance but is also expected to identify new pathways by which 
TUDCA exerts insulin sensitizing effects. In addition to improving clinical care of people with HIV, the 
findings of this study may allow development of new drugs for treatment of type 2 diabet es. 
Purpose of Study Protocol  
The overall goals of this proposal are to evaluate whether TUDCA administration improves insulin sensitivity in 
HIV+ people receiving ritonavir -boosted, PI -ART, and to examine the potential cellular mechanisms through 
which TU DCA imparts its metabolic benefits. These findings will reveal novel molecular mechanisms by which 
TUDCA exposure improves insulin resistance in people living with HIV.  Specifically, we will conduct  a double -
blind placebo -controlled trial to examine the e ffect of TUDCA (1.75g x 4 weeks) on multi -organ insulin 
sensitivity, muscle TGR5 signaling, and markers of adipocyte ER stress in 48 insulin -resistant, HIV+ men and 
women  receiving ritonavir -containing PI -ART 
B. Background  
B1. Prior Literature  
HIV infect ion is associated with increased risk of metabolic abnormalities.  HIV+ individuals have a 2 -4 fold 
greater risk for developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM) than the general population (1, 2)  as well as dramatically 
increased rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (3, 4) . Traditional risk factors including insulin resistance (IR)

 are key predictors of CVD events in chronic HIV infection, and are especially important given the greater 
prevalence of T2DM in HIV -infected people (4-7). Protease -inhibitor based antiretroviral therapy (PI -ART) use, 
in particular use of ritonavir (RTV), is an established risk factor for development of IR and T2DM (1, 8, 9) . Several 
PIs impair insulin -mediated stimulation of glucose uptake and suppression of glucose production and reduce 
insulin secretion (10-13). PIs can compete with glucose for binding to the facilitative glucose transporters 
expressed on skeletal myocytes (11). However, other intracellular molecular mechanisms are also likely at play. 
Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are associated with reduced expression of genes critical in adipoc yte 
development and mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC -1) (14-16).  Indeed, we, and others, have reported a reduced 
capacity for fatty acid (FA) oxidation in HIV+ people with IR (17). Reduced lipid oxidation may promote tissue 
lipid accumulation and insulin resistance (17, 18) . High concentrations of some PIs, including ritonavir, atazanavir 
and lopinavir, may also increase ER stress (19-25), which has been linked to development of insulin resistance 
(26-28), but this has yet to be demonstrated in vivo. Thus, the etiology of insulin resistance in treated HIV is likely 
multifactorial.  
Drug and lifestyle intervention are less effective in cART -associat ed insulin resistance . Lifestyle change 
is recommended for obese, HIV+ insulin -resistant people (29, 30) , however Engelson et al found that 7% weight 
loss did not improve IR in obese, HIV+ women (31). While exercise improves IR in HIV+ subjects, long -term 
changes in exercise habits are hard to maintain (32). Metformin and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) improve insulin 
sensitivity in HIV+  subjects (33, 34)  but these drugs are associated with several side effects. Metformin often 
causes diarrhea and worsens subcutaneous fat loss, while TZDs may increase th e risk of myocardial infarction, 
osteoporosis and worsen abdominal adiposity (33, 35 -41). Furthermore, recent data indicates that HIV infected 
people, particularly those receiving PIs, have poorer glycemic responses to anti -diabetic drugs than HIV 
uninfected people (42). New, effective therapies are badly needed.  
Bile acids (BAs) as an alternative therapy to increase insulin sensitivity. Studies conducted in cultured cells 
or in mouse models of obesity suggest that exogenous BAs improve insulin sensitivity (26-28). Members of our 
group performe d a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled trial to examine the effects of the bile acid 
tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) (donated by Bruschettini S.r.l.), which is approved for treatment of 
cholestatic liver disease in Europe, on insulin sensitivit y in HIV uninfected, insulin -resistant subjects (43). Insulin 
sensitivity was measured by using clamp protocols identical to that contained in this proposal. Treatment with 
1.75 g/day of TUDCA for 30 days (a dose and duration identical to that proposed i n this application) increased 
the hepatic insulin sensitivity index (Fig 1A) by 42% (0.86±0.17 vs 1.22±0.16 100/µmol/min x µU/ml, P<0.01) 
and insulin -sensitivity in skeletal muscle (Fig 1B) by 22% (Pre 48±5 vs Post 59±6 µmol/kgFFM/min, P<0.01 (Fig 
1). West ern blot analyses performed on muscle biopsies from these subjects by Dr. Finck’s lab, found that insulin 
receptor substrate -1 (IRS -1) phosphorylation and signaling (p -AKT) also improved (Fig 2), indicating that TUDCA 
administration ameliorates skeletal mu scle insulin resistance at a molecular level. Furthermore, these and other 
studies conducted by Dr. Finck, found no indication that ER stress signaling was activated in skeletal muscle of 
insulin resistant subjects compared to insulin sensitive controls or  that TUDCA reduced ER stress in  
Tauroursodeoxycholic acid for protease -inhibitor associated insulin resistance

these subjects (43). This raises th e possibility that the effects of TUDCA are independent of effects on ER stress 
signaling.  
Molecular actions of bile acids.  The mechanism(s) whereby BAs mediate metabolic improvements are unclear 
but may include [1] activating cell surface receptors that activate intracellular signal transduction cascades (27, 
28, 44 -47), [2] acting as chaperones that reduce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and/or [3] serving as ligands 
for nuclear receptors  that regulate gene transcription. This proposal is designed to address the two former 
mechanisms since, unlike other BAs, TUDCA has not been shown to have high affinity for any members of the 
nuclear receptor superfamily, and thus, this mechanism will not  be evaluated.  
TGR5, which is expressed in muscle, fat and liver, might mediate the metabolic effects of BAs.  Recent 
work has suggested that BAs, including TUDCA, bind and activate the cell surface G -protein -coupled receptor 
TGR5. Several BAs, including TUDCA, exhibit high affinity for TGR5 and knockout of TGR5 abolishes the 
intracellular signaling response to BA s. In C57BL6 mice ( with normal 
TGR5 activity ), activation of TGR5 by BAs increases intracellular 
deiodinization of thyroid hormone by type 2 deiodinase (D2), converting 
tetra-iodothyronine (T4) to the more biologically active tri -iodothyronine 
(T3) which b inds the iodothyronine receptor (TR) (44). This increases 
energy expenditure and fatty acid oxidation by stimulating expression 
of genes encoding fatty acid transport and oxidation (CPT -1) enzymes, 
and promoting mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC -1) (Fig 3). Studies in 
human skeletal muscle cells also showed that these effects were 
translatable to humans as well (44). Our preliminary data show that 
TUDCA administration for 30 days increases expression of D2 in 
skeletal muscle in insulin -resistant, HIV uninfected subjects (see 
Innovation ). Th is proposal will evaluate the effects of TUDCA on 
markers of TGR5 action in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue of HIV+ 
subjects receiving PI -ART, clarifying whether this pathway may have 
therapeutic potential for other insulin resistant states. The proposed

 studies will also use molecular genetic approaches to define whether TGR5 activation is required for the insulin 
sensitizing effects in skeletal myotubes exposed to PIs.  
TUDCA may act as a chemical chaperone to assist with protein folding and reduce ER stress.  During 
periods o f cellular 
stress such as drug 
exposure to PIs, 
chronic viral infection 
(e.g. hepatitis C), or 
obesity, protein 
misfolding may 
occur in the ER and 
induce the unfolded 
protein response 
(UPR), which has 
been linked to the 
development of 
insulin resistance 
(27, 28, 48 -50). The 
UPR activates thr ee 
signaling cascades 
(Fig 4).  
1) Release of the 
chaperone Bip 
(Grp78) into the ER   
to assist protein 
folding  and 
attenuate general protein synthesis by activation of PER - kinase 
(PERK), leading to phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α 
(eIF2α).  
2) Activation of inositol -requiring enzyme 1 (IRE -1), resulting in alternative  splicing the XBP -1 transcript and the 
expression of XBP -1 protein, which in turn induces expression of a wide range of chaperone proteins which 
ameliorate protein misfolding. IRE -1 also activates JNK worsening insulin resistance (27, 51) .  
3) Release of bound activating transcription factor -6 (ATF -6), which induces XBP -1 expression and upregulates 
production of molecular chaperones. Through mechanisms that are still mostly un clear, TUDCA is known to 
reduce ER stress and is thought to act as a chemical chaperone to facilitate proper folding of misfolded proteins 
(28, 52, 53) .  
Besides its critical role in maintaining ER homeostasis, the UPR has an important impact on metabolic regulation 
and insulin signaling. Both defective and excessive activation of ER stress pathways have been linked to JNK 
activation, inflammation, and insu lin resistance in several mouse models (17, 22, 23).  Similarly, interventions 
that reduce ER stress, including TUDCA, improve insulin resistance in animal models (27, 28)  and HIV uninfected

 human subjects (43). Both HIV and PIs may activate the UPR and thereby contribute to metabolic dysfunction 
(19, 24, 54) .  
However, there is also evidence that the ameliorative effects of TUDCA on ER stress are not related to the 
insulin -sensitizing effects of this agent. For example, in Kars et al., we found that skeletal muscle glucose 
disposal and insulin signaling were improved in obese subjects, but found no evidence that ER stress was 
activated in skeletal muscle of th ese subjects or that TUDCA attenuated ER stress in this tissue (43). Our new 
prelim inary data indicate that TUDCA improves insulin -stimulated glucose uptake in ritonavir -treated human 
skeletal myocytes, but we found no evidence that RTV caused ER stress in these cells. This could suggest other 
mechanisms whereby TUDCA elicits its effects . Therefore this proposal will clarify whether markers of ER stress 
are reduced in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue of HIV+ subjects after administration of TUDCA .  
B2. Rationale for Study:  
HIV+ people receiving PI -ART have an increased risk of DM and a blunted response to antidiabetic 
pharmacotherapy. Bile acids improve insulin sensitivity in animals and HIV seronegative humans, upregulate 
mitochondrial biogenesis, increase fatty acid oxidation, and may reduce ER stress, all of which are likely to have 
favorable metabolic effects. This proposal will use state of the art techniques to examine the hypothesis that the 
bile acid TUDCA will improve insulin -stimulated glucose disposal (i.e. insulin -sensitivity in skeletal muscle) in 
HIV+, insulin -resistant subj ects receiving PI -ART. Further, we will clarify the cellular and molecular mechanisms 
by which TUDCA confers its benefits to test two hypotheses focused on the TGR5 and ER stress pathways. The 
mechanistic findings of this proposal will benefit insulin -resistant subjects irrespective of HIV serostatus.  
Study Objectives  
The overall goals of this proposal are to evaluate whether TUDCA administration improves insulin sensitivity in 
HIV+ people receiving ritonavir -boosted, PI -ART, and to examine the potential ce llular mechanisms through 
which TUDCA imparts its metabolic benefits. These findings will reveal novel molecular mechanisms by which 
TUDCA exposure improves insulin resistance in people living with HIV.  Specifically, we will conduct  a double -
blind placebo -controlled trial to examine the effect of TUDCA (1.75g x 4 weeks) on multi -organ insulin sensitivity, 
muscle TGR5 signaling, and markers of adipocyte ER stress in 48 insulin -resistant, HIV+ men and women  
receiving ritonavir -containing PI -ART 
The followin g Specific Aims  will be evaluated:  
1. Determine the effect of TUDCA administration on multi -organ insulin sensitivity.  
We hypothesize that TUDCA will improve in vivo  insulin sensitivity more than placebo in skeletal 
muscle (glucose uptake) (primary endpoint), liver ( suppression of glucose production), and adipose 
tissue ( suppression of lipolysis ), assessed in vivo  by using a two -stage euglycemic -hyperinsulinemic 
clamp  procedure with stable isotope tracer infusion and in the cellular components of the insulin 
signaling cascade (phosphorylation of IRS1 and Akt) and factors that inhibit insulin signaling 
(phosphorylation of JNK) in muscle and adipose tissue obtained by pe rcutaneous biopsy .  
2. Evaluate the effect of TUDCA on TGR5 activation and the role that this plays in the 
insulin sensitizing effects of TUDCA. We hypothesize that TUDCA treatment will increase skeletal 
muscle expression of D2 (primary endpoint), PGC -1α, an d other markers of TGR5 activation. In 
addition, we hypothesize that in vitro knockdown of TGR5 will attenuate the beneficial effects of TUDCA

 on PI -induced insulin resistance.  
3. Determine the effect of TUDCA on endoplasmic reticulum stress in HIV+ men and w omen 
receiving PI -ART. We hypothesize that TUDCA will reduce adipose tissue markers of ER stress and 
inflammation (BIP/Grp78 (primary endpoint), Grp94, pEIF2a/EIF2a, IRE -1, PERK, spliced Xbp1, Chop, 
ATF6, ATF4, and phosphoJNK)  
 
The results from this study  will elucidate new intracellular pathways by which TUDCA exerts insulin 
sensitizing effects among HIV+ men and women receiving PI -ART, who represent a population at very 
high risk for diabetes and CHD.

 D Investigational Agent  
D1. Preclinical Data  
TUDCA improves RTV -induced glucose intolerance in vivo.  The primary endpoint of this application 
is to determine whether TUDCA wil l improve insulin -stimulated glucose disposal in HIV+ subjects treated 
with PI -ART. Ritonavir (RTV) boosted, PI -ART is the most commonly used PI therapy in our local HIV+ 
subjects (55) and is known to impair insulin sensitivity and risk of development of the metabolic syndrome 
(13, 56, 57) . To begin to test the efficacy of TUDCA at ameliorating RTV -induced insulin resistance, wild -
type, lean C57/BL6 mice were fasted 
overnight and then injected 
intraperitoneally TUDCA (500 mg/kg) or 
vehicle, on e hour before receiving 
intraperitoneal RTV (1 mg/kg). This low 
dose of RTV dose, ~10% of that usually 
used in these experiments, was chosen 
because it is expected to achieve plasma 
concentrations similar to that seen with 
clinical use of ritonavir (10).  An 
intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test 
(IPGTT) was performed 1 hour later (Fig 
5A). Glucose AUC was greater in RTV 
(27477±1060 mg/dl x 120min), than the 
vehicle (22100±316, P=0.001), TUDCA 
(22500±928, P=0.001) and RTV+TUDCA 
(22902±372, P=0.001) groups. We also 
examined insulin signaling in fasted mice 
treated with TUDCA and RTV as in the  
IPGTT, but injected with insulin 10 min 
prior to sacrifice (n=2). In this pilot 
experiment, RTV treatment led to 
diminished Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt 
in gastrocnemius muscle, whereas 
TUDCA pretreatment reversed this effect 
of RTV (Fig 5B). These resul ts indicate 
that TUDCA almost completely ameliorates RTV -induced glucose intolerance  and impairments in insulin 
signaling in vivo.  
TUDCA ameliorates RTV -induced insulin resistance in vitro. We examined whether TUDCA would 
reduce insulin resistance induced  by RTV in human skeletal myotubes. Muscle satellite cells were 
isolated from vastus lateralis muscle biopsies obtained from HIV -seronegative subjects and were 
differentiated into myotubes for 10 days by Dr. Chen,  as described previously (58, 59)   On day 11, 
myotubes were then incubated with or without TUDCA (400 µg/ml) for 6 hours . RTV (10 µM) or vehicle 
(DMSO) were then added to the culture media and cells were incubated for ~8 hrs. 3H-2-deoxy glucose

 (2DG ) was measured in the absence (basal) or presence of insulin (1 µg/ml). As shown in Fig 6, RTV 
reduced glucose uptake by ~50%, but this effect was partially reversed with pre -incubation with TUDCA.  
In this pilot study, we specifically chose RTV concentrations were 2 -3x that seen with boosting -doses to 
allow us to better delineate a potential maximum benefit of TUDCA on RTV -induced insulin resistance.   
We also examined the effects of TUDCA on 
ER stress markers in human myocytes that 
had been treated with PIs (Fig 7). At the 
same doses and durations that impair basal 
and insulin stimulated glucose uptake (Fig 
6), RTV did not activate EIF2a 
phosphorylation  or Bip protein abundance 
(Fig 7). Other groups have shown that PIs 
induce ER stress in adipocytes and 
macrophages in vitro (19, 60) . Indeed, 
lopinavir co -induced insulin resistance and 
ER str ess in human adipocytes (19). On the 
other hand, the lack of effect o f RTV on ER 
stress in skeletal myocytes is consistent 
with of the work of several groups showing 
that obesity -related insulin resistance is not 
associated with increased ER stress in skeletal muscle, but is associated with increased ER stress in 
liver and adipocytes (27, 43) .  These findings suggest that the insulin -sensitizing effects of TUDCA may 
be independe nt of its anti -ER stress mode of action.  
Initiation of PI -ART induces ER stress in adipose tissue but not skeletal muscle.  To expand upon 
this point, we determined whether initiation of PI -ART containing ritonavir led to indications of ER stress 
in humans. We performed western -blots for Grp78(Bip), EIF2α and phosphorylated EIF2α (pEIF2α) on 
skeletal muscle and adipose tissue biopsies from 7 HIV+ patients (5M, BMI 26±1kg/m2), naïve to ART, 
with asymptomatic HIV infection,  before,  and 4 months after initiation of PI -ART (6ATV/RTV, 1 DRV/RTV, 
all receiving DF+FTC), which increased HOMA (1.7±0.1 vs 2.4±0.4, P=0.09) in these subjec ts. Although 
insulin resistance was worsened by PI initiation, skeletal muscle abundance of GRP78 and 
phosphorylated EIF2a was not affected by PI administration (Fig 8), which is consistent with our in vitro 
data.

 In contrast, in adipose tissue, Grp78 abu ndance and the PeIF2α: eIF2α ratio increased after 4 months of 
PI-ART (Fig 9). These results suggest that PI -ART induces ER stress in adipocytes but not skeletal 
muscle in vivo in HIV+ humans. Recent work has suggested that dysfunctional adipose tissue, a term 
that encompasses a broad range of metabolic and inflammatory perturbations including ER stress, is 
involved in systemic insulin resistance by affecting circulating concentrations of metabolites, adipokines, 
and pro -inflammatory mediators. We have hypo thesized that administration of TUDCA will reduce 
indications of ER stress in adipose tissue and will determine whether these changes are associated with 
improvements in multi -organ insulin sensitivity.  
 
TUDCA increases expression of deiodinase 2 in skeletal muscle.  Our alternative hypothesis is that 
TUDCA may be improving insulin sensitivity after RTV treatment via 
other mechanisms. Previous work has demonstrated that TUDCA is a 
potent activator of TGR5 signaling in human skeletal myocytes in vitro 
(44). To determine whether marke rs of TGR5 activation were also 
induced in human muscle at therapeutic doses, in collaboration with 
Dr. Abumrad’s laboratory, we performed quantitative RT -PCR to 
quantify D2 mRNA expression in skeletal muscle biopsies from 
subjects treated with TUDCA (1.75 /day, N=9) or placebo (N=9) for 30 
days (Fig 10) (43). A strong trend towards increased expression of D2 
was detected after 30 days of treatment with TUDCA (P=0.057), but 
was unchanged by placebo. These data provide evidence that TUDCA 
may impart its metabolic actions in part by increasing expression of D2 
through TGR5 in skeletal muscle in humans in vivo. Our proposal will 
determine whether use of TUDCA causes similar changes in the 
setting of treated HIV, whether other TGR5 targets are ac tivated by 
TUDCA in skeletal muscle in vivo (PGC1, CPT -1), and will use 
sophisticated in vitro approaches to define whether TGR5 is required 
for the beneficial effects of TUDCA on RTV -induced insulin resistance. These findings could potentially 
have a majo r impact on our understanding of how TUDCA improves insulin sensitivity in humans and 
assist with development of another class of antidiabetic agents.  
In summary , our preliminary data show:  
1. RTV -induced glucose intolerance (and insulin resistance) is improved by treatment with TUDCA in 
mice.  
2. RTV induces insulin resistance, but not ER stress, in human skeletal myocytes and RTV -induced 
insulin resistance is improved by treatment with TUDC A.  
3. Markers of ER stress are increased in adipose tissue, but not skeletal muscle, biopsies of ART -naïve 
HIV+ subjects 4 months after initiation of PI -ART.  
4. Treatment of insulin -resistant, HIV uninfected, human subjects with 1.75 g of TUDCA for 30 da ys 
induces markers of TGR5 activation in skeletal muscle.  
The proposed mechanisms of insulin sensitization by TUDCA are not mutually exclusive and both 
pathways could be involved. TUDCA clearly elicits rapid ameliorative effects on ER stress in response t o 
a variety of stimuli in liver and adipose tissue. However, prolonged (4 week) treatment with TUDCA *

 improves skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in human obese subjects, who did not exhibit an activation of 
the ER stress response in that tissue (43). While the effect on skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity could be 
explained by peripheral effects on hepatic or adipose tissue metabolism or adipokine secretion, these 
effects could also be mediated by activation of TGR5 signaling in skeletal muscle. TUDCA may also have 
both acute and chronic actions or alternatively could be affecting ER stress pathways in a tissue -specific 
manner.  By clarifying the mechanism(s) responsible for improvements in insulin sensitivity with TUDCA, 
this proposal wil l improve the quality of care for people living with HIV, but also benefit those with insulin 
resistance but without HIV.  
 
D.2 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefit  
Natural bile salt s consist of a family of amphipathic steroids produced by cholest erol metabolism  in the 
liver. Bile salts  are classified as primary (synthesized in the liver) or secondary (produced by bacterial 
transformation of bile salts within the gut). In man, primary bile salts consist of cholic acid (CA) and 
chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and the  secondary  bile salts  deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid 
(LCA). Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is an epimer of CDCA and is normally present in small amounts in 
human bile (0 -5% of total pool) however taurine -conjugated UDCA (TUDCA)  represents the phy siologic 
form in which UDCA is secreted in bile. The taurine conjugation makes UDCA slightly more water soluble 
and makes precipitation of TUDCA within the gallbladder improbable  due to the acidic conditions.  
TUDCA has been licensed for the treatment of c holesterol gallstones and for therapy of chronic 
cholestatic liver disease in Europe since 1991  and is used at a dose of 10-20 mg/kg/day depending on 
the indication . Chronic toxicity has been studied in dogs for up to 26 weeks with treatment of up to 400 -
600 mg/kg/day (30 x that of the proposed dose) with no observed toxicity. Rats treated with 2 -20 times 
the proposed dose showed no evidence of carcinogenic effects after 24 months of treatment. (Please 
see appendix ).  
Several recent studies indicate that 1.75g/day of TUDCA as proposed in this application is a safe and 
likely effective dose for insuiln resistance. In a  recent  study 10 obese, insulin -resistant adults received  
1.75 g/day of TUDCA  for 4 weeks with no adverse events. (43) A cohort of subjects with primary biliary 
cirrhosis were treated with 500 -1500 mg/day of TUDCA for 6 months, with diarrhea reported as the only 
side-effect. Several human studies have shown that use of TUDCA is well tolerated in many chronically 
ill popul ations including amyloidosis (61), primary biliary ci rrhosis  (62-65) and liver transplant (66). Most 
experience with TUDCA has been in the use of this agent with liver disease, predominantly primary 
biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Crosignani et al treated 24 subjects with PBC with 500mg, 1000mg, or 1500mg 
of TUDCA per day. (63) All patients showed improvements in liver function tests with the greatest 
improvements seen in the 1000mg and 1500mg doses. The only reported side effect was diarrhea. The 
predominant side effects reported  with TUDCA use in human studies have been diarrhea, headache, 
dyspepsia or abdominal pain. We exclude all patients with prior gallbladder disease or with diarrhea.  
 
 
In summary, TUDCA has been tolerated at similar dose in humans with a variety of chronic  medical 
conditions, with the major side -effects being mild diarrhea. The balance of the clinical information 
suggests that this drug is well tolerated and could have important health benefits for this study 
population. There are no known interactions betw een bile acids and antiretroviral drugs.

  The dose proposed in this study is 1.75 g/day which will correspond to an average dose of 15 -20 
mg/kg/day. We wish to use this dose because this is a dose that has been shown to be effective in 
other human studies  with few side effects. (43)   
Based on available animal and human data, other than the potential for diarrhea, TUDCA appears to be 
very well tolerated even at doses  30-fold greater than that proposed . We therefore believe that this 
agent has shown very limited toxicity in humans but could confer significant cardiometabolic benefit.  
E. Study Design  
E.1  
Specific Aim 1: Determine the effect of TUDCA on multi -organ insulin sensitivity.  
Multi -organ insulin sensitivity will be assessed by performing euglycemic clamps, in conjunction with 
stable isotope labeled tracer infusion (section 4) and tissue biopsies, before and after placebo or TUDCA. 
We have predicted that treatment with TUDCA wil l improve skeletal muscle glucose disposal and insulin 
signaling in HIV+ subject treated with PI -ART.    
1. Subjects.   The study population will consist of two groups of patients (Fig 11):  
Group 1  will consist of 24 subjects with HIV+ receiving RTV boosted PI -ART who have insulin resistance 
as evidenced by the presence of impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or 
HOMA -IR>3.0 who will receive TUDCA 1.75g/day for 30 days.  
Group 2  will consist of a total of 24 subjects with HIV+ receiving RTV boosted PI -ART who have IFG, 
IGT or HOMA>3.0 who will receive matching placebo for 30 days.

Study subjects will be recruited from the resources listed below.  
Washington University ACTU : Dr. Presti provides clinical care at the ACTU. Since establishment in 1987, 
over 1700 enrolled in 263 clinical research projects at the ACTU.  Since 2001, the ACTU has consistently 
enrolled 300 -500 patients per year in HIV/AIDS clinical studies. The PI h as worked with the ACTU for 
>10 years.   
Vanderbilt Comprehensive Care Clinic and Vanderbilt Therapeutics Clinical Trial Unit (VTCRS) : Drs 
Koethe and Hulgan provide care for HIV+ patients at the VUMS -ACTU. They have an excellent 
relationship with local ASO s. The PI has been working with Dr. Hulgan for the last 14 months to begin a 
collaborative relationship of screening patients at the VUMS -ACTU for this protocol. The research team 
at VUMS are famililar with all aspects of the study including adverse events  (both actual and theoretical) 
and the current data. They are experts in the provision of clinical care of HIV+ patients and regularly 
perform metabolic studies within this population.  
AIDS Service Organizations (ASO):  The ACTU has excellent relationships  with ASO’s and acts as 
consultants to them on medical issues and provides speakers on a regular basis. The ACTU has a close 
collaboration with the St.Louis Effort for AIDS (EFA), the largest ASO in the St. Louis Metropolitan area 
and Blacks Assisting Blac ks Against AIDS  (BABAA) the major ASO working with African -American HIV -
infected persons.  
Community Advisory Board (CAB) : The CAB consists of individuals from patient, health care and 
community constituencies serving the target population. Dr. Presti atte nds the monthly meetings, and 
presents current activities to seek input from CAB members about priorities for the community.

 St Louis HIV Primary Care Task Force : Dr. Presti is a member of the St Louis HIV Primary Care task 
Force; a group of physicians who  meet regularly to discuss research studies. In combination they care 
for ~2000 patients with HIV in the St. Louis metropolitan area. Historically 30% of our subjects have been 
referred from this group.   
Study to Understand the Natural History of HIV and AIDS in the Era of Effective Therapy (SUN trial):  Dr. 
Presti is Director of the ‘SUN’ Study.  250 patients are enrolled in this five -year, CDC -funded, longitudinal 
cohort study to evaluate the metabolic effects of HAART. 53% percent are African American an d 26% 
are women. Enrollment in SUN will facilitate co -enrollment in the current proposal.  
 
 
 
3. Screening studies  (Performed at WUSTL and VUMS -ACTU)  
Medical examination . All subjects will be screened with a detailed history and physical examination, 
pregnancy test ( if female ) and CBC, lipid profile, liver panel and resting 12 -lead electrocardiogram. CD4 
T-cell count, and plasma viral load. Oral glucose tolerance test.   After an overnight (12 h) fast, blood 
samples for plasma glucose, and insulin will be obtained immediately before and every 30 min for 2 h 
after ingesting a 75 g oral glucose load. The criteria of the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and 
Classification of Diabetes Mellitus (67) will be used to det ermine diabetes. .Other than these screening 
procedures, a ll other components of the study are performed at WUSTL.  
 Eligible subjects from VUMS -ACTU who are consented and are eligible will be discussed by the research 
team at VUMS -ACTU and the study PI, Dr.  Reeds. If the subject meets eligibility criteria transport will be 
arranged by WUSTL for the patient to undergo body composition, assessment of intramyocellular and 
intrahepatic TG content and the inpatient isotope -infusion protocols at WUSTL. After compl etion of 
baseline inpatient testing they will be kept overnight and transported back to Nashville the following day. 
All eligible subjects will undergo baseline testing within 3 months of screening. Subjects will have their 
study medication dispensed at WU STL and both WUSTL and the VUMS -ACTU will have a staff member 
(Rebecca Basham, RN, not involved in data analysis) unblinded to group assignment for safety. Subjects 
enrolled at VUMS -ACTU will return to VUMS -ACTU every ~7 days for a pill count, vital signs,  and to 
assess for any medication intolerance or other AEs.  
 
Body Composition and assessment of intramyocellular and intrahepatic TG content: Body composition 
will be measured within a week of the isotope infusion protocol.  Total body fat and fat -free ma ss will be 
determined by dual energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Hologic QDR 4500, Waltham, MA) (68).  
Abdominal (subcutaneous and intra -abdominal) adipose tissue mass will be quantified by magnetic 
resonance imaging (69, 70) . Intrahepatic  TG content will be determined by proton MRS ( 3T whole -body 
system; Magneton Vision Scanner; Siemens, Erlanger, Germany)  as previously described  (71). 
Cardiovascular structure  (Performed at WUSTL)  
 
Cardiac echo and tissue Doppler imaging .  Comprehensive rest ing echocardiography  will be 
used to assess cardiac structure and function.  This test is performed using a state -of-the-art 
ultrasound system (Vivid E9 Leadership or Vivid I Portable Cardiovascular Systems, GE 
Healthcare).  Echocardiographic characterization will include ass essments of left ventricular 
(LV) mass, LV size, LV systolic  function , and LV diastolic function. LV mass will be determined 
by two methods: the 2D -derived LV mass indexed to body surface area and the 2D -guided M -
mode -derived cubed method indexed to height2.7 (LVM/Ht2.7), which has been used extensively 
in clinical trials of hypertension (as recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography 
Tauroursodeoxycholic acid for protease -inhibitor associated insulin resistance  
PI: Reeds  
16 
 guidelines for clinical trials) and has been shown to be hig hly reliable and a robust phenotype in 
overweight/obese populations 71-73.  The presence of LVH will be defined as an LVM/Ht2.7 
greater than two standard deviations above the mean (i.e. >47 g/m2.7 for men , >44 g/m2.7 for 
women) 74.  2D -directed echocardiographic measurements  include the LV end -diastolic and 
end-systolic volumes using the method of discs . The LV ejection fraction (LVEF) will be 
calculated  using  the modified Simpson ’s method (LVEF ≥55% considered normal).  LVDD will 
be characterized as follows: 1) PWD -derived t ransmitral indices recorded from the four -chamber 
view at the mitral valve leaflet tips, including the early diastolic (E -wave) and atrial (A -wave) 
velocities, E/A velocity ratio, E -wave deceleration time (DT), and the isovolumic relaxation time 
(IVRT) 75; 2) Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) -derived early diastolic myocardial velocity (E’) 
obtained at the septal and lateral mitral annulus from the apical four -chamber view and the 
averaged  value  75-77.  TDI -derived indices of LV diastolic relaxation (i.e., E’ velocity) are 
relatively load -independent and inversely correlate with the degree of interstitial fibrosis 78-81. 
Consistent with the recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography for clinica l 
studies of patients with hypertension, TDI -derived early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E’) will 
be used as the primary assessment of diastolic function 73.  When dichotomization of LVDD is 
necessary for analysis, an E’ <9.0 cm/s will be considered evidence of impaired LV relaxation.  
Measurements will be reported as the average of values from 3 consecutive cardiac cycles . 
 
5. Isotope -Infusi on Protocols.  
Pre-study dietary intake and physical activity . All subjects will be instructed to abstain from any exercise 
and to ingest a standard weight -maintaining diet for three days before the isotope infusion protocol. Our 
study dietician will give dietary instructions individually to each subject. Each subject will keep a complete 
3-day food log to judge compliance. The diet will contain at least 300 g of carbohydrate/day and the 
relative contributions from protein, carbohydrate, and fat will be app roximately 15%, 55%, and 35% of 
calories, respectively. On the third day of the diet, subjects will be admitted to the IRU at 1600 h and their 
3-day diet records will be reviewed.  If their diet is inappropriate (e.g. inadequate in carbohydrate or 
energy i ntake) the study will be rescheduled. The study’s dietary counselor will provide counseling by 
phone to participants recruited from the Vanderbilt site.  
Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.  Subjects will be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) for 
isotope infusion studies to assess insulin sensitivity in liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (Fig 12).    
At 1800 h on the day of admission, subjects will be given a standard meal (containing 15 kcal/kg FFM), 
which will be consumed by 1900 h.  Subject s will then receive a can of BoostTM. After this meal, subjects 
will fast until completion of the isotope infusion studies the following day.  At 0500h, a catheter will be 
inserted into the antecubital vein of the arm to infuse isotope tracers and another catheter will be placed 
in the contralateral dorsal hand vein. The hand will then be placed in a thermostatically controlled box 
heated to 55C to obtain arterialized blood samples. If a hand vein cannot be cannulated, a radial arterial 
line will be placed.   We have found that a radial artery catheter is well tolerated by study subjects, and 
ensures rapid and secure blood sampling.  We now have inserted hundreds of catheters without any 
complications.

At 0600 h a hyperinsulinemic -euglycemic clamp procedure with isotope infusion will be initiated to 
determine hepatic (glucose production), skeletal muscle (glucose disposal) and adipose tissue (lipolysis) 
insulin sensitivity.  After baseline blood samples are obtained, [6,6 -2H2]glucose (22 µmol/kg prime and 
0.22 µmol.kg-1.min-1 constant infusion) will be infused.  After 90 min (0730 h), a constant infusion of [U -
13C]palmitate ( 6 nmol.kg FFM-1.min-1) will be started to determine the rate of appearance (Ra) of plasma 
palmitate .  At, 0930 h, after the basal period  is completed, a two -stage euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic 
clamp will be initiated and continued for 6.5 h. Euglycemia will be achieved by a variable rate infusion of 
20% dextrose enriched to approximately 2.5% with [6,6 -2H2]glucose to minimize changes in glu cose 
isotopic enrichment.  Adding tracer to the dextrose infusion has been shown to provide more accurate 
measures of glucose Ra (72), by minimizing changes in plasma glu cose enrichment.  During stage 1 of 
the clamp (3.5 h to 6.5 h of isotope infusion), insulin will be infused at a rate of 7 mU.m2.min-1 for 3 h 
(initiated with a two -step priming dose of 30 mU.m2.min-1 for 5 min followed by 15 mU.m2.min-1 for 5 min), 
which will achieve plasma insulin concentrations of ~25 µU/ml. During stage 2 of the clamp (6.5 h to 10 
h of the isotope infusion), insulin will be infused at a rate of 50 mU.m2.min-1 for 3.5 h (initiated with a two -
step priming dose of 200 mU.m2.min-1 for 5 min  followed by 100 mU.m2.min-1 for 5 min), which will achieve 
plasma insulin concentrations of approximately 80 µU/ml. These plasma insulin concentrations provide 
an optimal range for evaluating insulin’s effect on hepatic glucose production and lipolysis (l ow-dose 
insulin infusion) and glucose uptake by skeletal muscle (high -dose insulin infusion).  The infusion of 
[2H2]glucose and [U -13C]palmitate will be decreased by 50% of basal during stage 1 and by 75% during 
stage 2 because of the expected decreases in hepatic glucose production and lipolytic rate. Plasma 
samples will be taken before beginning the infusion to obtain baseline measurements of substrate 
enrichment. Plasma samples will be taken every 10 min during the las t 30 min of the basal period and

 each stage of the insulin clamp to determine glucose and FFA concentrations and kinetics, and insulin 
concentrations. Plasma samples will be obtained every 10 min at the end of the basal period and 
throughout the entire cla mp to monitor plasma glucose concentration.   
At the completion of the clamp, the insulin  will be turned off  . Plasma glucose will be checked every 1 0 
minutes  and the rate of 20% dextrose infusion will be reduced by 50% if B G >100mg/ml. After the 20% 
dextr ose is off PG is checked every 10  min until B G ret urns to baseline . A bolus of 0.3g/kg of dextrose 
will then be given intravenously over one minutes. Bloo samples will be taken every 2 minutes for 8 
minutes total to measure plasma insulin and c -peptide con centrations. In the event of hypoglycemia 
during the clamp (BG<60mg/dl) the insulin will be turned off, 20 grams of glucose will be given 
intravenously and the D20 rate will be titrated to achieve BG>100mg/dl. The study will then be aborted 
and the subject will be fed and observed as described above.  
Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production will be measured by indirect calorimetry at 0900, 
1200 and at 1600 h, for 30 minutes by using a metabolic cart and a ventilated hood system (Parvomedics 
TrueOne2400, Parvome dics, Sandy, UT).  These data will be used to examine energy expenditure and 
substrate oxidation.  
Tissue Biopsy:  Tissue will be obtained from subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue and the vastus 
lateralis  muscle 60 min after starting the glucose tracer inf usion (basal stage of the clamp procedure).  
Muscle and fat biopsies will also be obtained 60 min after starting stage 2 of the clamp procedure to 
determine the effect of insulin infusion on insulin signaling and adipocyte markers.  The biopsy sites will 
be cleaned and draped in a sterile manner. After anesthetizing the area with lidocaine, adipose tissue 
will obtained aspirated through a liposuction cannula, ~200 mg of muscle will be obtained by using a 6 
mm Bergstrom needle inserted through a small (0.5 c m) skin incision. All tissue samples will be 
immediately rinsed with ice -cold saline.   Adipose tissue samples will be divided into 2 aliquots: 1) 
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent determination of cell factors and q uantitative PCR 
2) ) p laced in formalin for subsequent microscopy and immunohistochemistry analys es The PI has 
performed several hundred of these procedures and they are well tolerated by subjects.  
 Analysis of Samples.  All analytical procedures required for this proposal are routinely performed in Dr. 
Klein’s, Dr. Finck’s, and Dr. Abumrad’s laboratories, the CRU Core Laboratory, the Nutrition and Obesity 
Research Core (NORC) and the Adipocyte Core Biology Laboratories.  Screening laboratory specimens 
obtained from participants who complete the screening visit at the Vanderbilt site will be processed by 
LabCorp using commercially available assays  (Birmingham, AL)”.  
Plasma glucose and palmitate, kinetics :  The resources of the NORC will be used for sample analysis. 
The lab has str eamlined methods to process plasma to recover these substrates and derivatize them for 
GC/MS analyses (69, 70, 73 -75). Steele’s steady state equation (76) will be used to calculate sub strate 
kinetics.  
Molecular correlates of insulin sensitivity: We have hypothesized that TUDCA administration will 
improve insulin sensitivity in HIV+ subjects receiving ART. To evaluate molecular indicators of this, the 
phosphorylation status of several pr oteins that are downstream of the insulin receptor signaling cascade 
will be assessed, including phosphoserine473 and total Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) and total, 
phosphotyrosine, and phosphoserine IRS -1 by immunoblotting. These endpoints will be assessed d uring 
baseline conditions and during stage 2 of the clamp in skeletal muscle biopsies and quantified as

 described just above. Briefly, total cellular proteins will be extracted by mechanical disruption using a 
Tissue -Lyzer in lysis buffer containing protea se and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein concentration will be 
determined and proteins electrophoresed under denaturing conditions. Western blot results will be 
visualized and band intensity quantified using the Licor Odyssey system provided by the NORC. The  
intensity of the phosphorylated forms of the proteins are corrected for total content of that protein and 
normalized to the baseline value. Dr. Finck’s laboratory performs these analyses routinely (77-80) 
including  in the prior TUDCA study (43).  
Measurement of serum bile acid concentration: Plasma bile acids will be measured using high -
performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (81) 
Other assays: Plasma insulin, CRP, adiponectin, leptin, TNF α and IL -6 will be measured by the CRU 
Core laboratory using commercially available assays (Linco, St Charles, MO).  
Specific Aim 2:  Determine the effect of TUDCA on markers of TGR5 activation.  
A major strength of this proposal is the systematic and rigorous examination of the molecular 
mechanisms that are likely to be responsible for the metabolic effects of TUDCA. Our leading hypothe sis 
is that TUDCA enhances insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle by activating the G -protein coupled cell 
surface receptor TGR5.  This hypothesis will be tested by examining the mRNA expression and protein 
abundance of  TGR5 targets in subjects before and a fter treatment with TUDCA (or placebo). We will 
then determine the requirement for TGR5 signaling for the response to TUDCA by using siRNA -based 
TGR5 silencing.  
In vivo studies: We will evaluate markers of TGR5 activation (PGC -1, several genes encoding f atty acid 
oxidation enzymes, enzymes involved in electron transport, and type 2 deiodinase) in adipose and 
skeletal muscle tissue samples taken before and after administration of TUDCA at the levels of protein 
abundance and mRNA expression. Protein  will be  isolated in the presence of protease and phosphatase 
inhibitors as described in Aim 1. The protein content and/or phosphorylation status will be performed by 
using western blotting. The antibodies above are all commercially available and have been used 
previously by Dr. Finck’s lab (43, 74, 77 -80, 82 -84). Total RNA  will be isolated from tissue biopsies using 
RNAzol Bee as we have described numerous times previously (43, 74, 77 -80, 82 -84). Quantitative RT -
PCR will be performed by using reagents from Applied Biosystems and the ABI 7500 provided by the 
NORC Adipocyte Biology Core. Muscle mitochondrial DNA content will also be determined by back -
extracting total DNA during RNA extracti on and measuring the DNA for the mitochondrial gene, Cox1, 
and normalizing to nuclear DNA content by measuring RPLP0 DNA, which is encoded in the nucleus. 
Primer sets have been validated to specifically detect mRNAs of interest. We predict that TUDCA 
treatment will lead to increased expression and protein abundance of markers of TGR5 activation in 
human skeletal muscle.  
In vitro studies: If our preliminary data hold true and the analyses described just above show that TUDCA 
administration activates multiple  markers of TGR5 activation, cell biological approaches will be used to 
determine whether TGR5 is required for the ameliorative effects of TUDCA on insulin signaling and 
glucose uptake. Human skeletal satellite cells will be isolated and differentiated int o myocytes in culture 
as described in the preliminary data. TGR5, which is well expressed in skeletal muscle cells (44), will 
then be knocked down by using siRNAs purchased from Sigma. We do not consider this to be a significant

20 
 technical hurdle as this technique is used frequently and successfully by Dr. Finck and Dr. Chen (78, 82 -
86) and Sigma will continue to provide  oligonucleotide siRNA candidates until successful knockdown is 
achieved. After identifying efficient siRNAs to knockdown TGR5, differentiated myocytes will be treated 
with siRNAs to TGR5 (or scrambled siRNA control) for 72 h, myocytes will be treated with  RTV (or vehicle) 
with or without pre -treatment with TUDCA as described in preliminary studies. Endpoints will include 
assessment of protein and mRNA markers of TGR5 activation and ER stress. Subsequent studies will 
include insulin stimulation to assess ph osphorylation of insulin signaling cascade proteins and uptake of 
2-deoxyglucose (as described in preliminary studies). We predict that knockdown of TGR5 will abolish 
the activation of D2 and other proteins under the control of this signaling pathway. In a ddition, if TGR5 
activation is important to the insulin -sensitizing effects of TUDCA, loss of TGR5 may also attenuate the 
ability of TUDCA to increase insulin sensitivity in these skeletal myotubes.  
Specific Aim 3 Determine the effect of TUDCA on ER stress .  
Alternatively or in addition, we have hypothesized that TUDCA may improve insulin signaling by reducing 
ER stress, possibly in a cell type -specific manner. To test this hypothesis, we will evaluate markers of 
ER stress in tissue biopsy samples taken bef ore and after administration of TUDCA. We will also evaluate 
the direct effects of TUDCA and RTV on these endpoints in adipocytes in culture to begin to dissect the 
molecular mechanisms involved.  
The proposed methods will examine all three major pathways of the UPR; specifically we will assess 1) 
activation of PERK by measuring protein abundance of PERK, pEIF2a, EIF2a, and ATF4, 2) ATF6 
activation by measuring the protein abundance of ATF6 and 3) Xbp1 splicing by measuring spliced Xbp1 
content. We will als o assess downstream targets of these pathways by measuring protein content of 
BIP/Grp78 and activation of the JNK pro -inflammatory pathway by measuring phosphoJNK.  
In vivo studies: ER stress markers will be quantified in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle  of study 
subjects. Protein and RNA will be isolated as described above and markers evaluated by using western 
blotting and qRT -PCR. We will assess various markers by protein abundance or phosphorylation status 
(BIP/Grp78, Grp94, pEIF2a/EIF2a, IRE -1, PERK,  spliced Xbp1, Chop, ATF6, ATF4, and phosphoJNK ).  
The splicing of Xbp1, which is increased by ER stress will be assessed by using SYBR chemistry 
quantitative reverse transcriptase -PCR (Applied Biosystems).  Relative abundance calculated using the 
delta -Ct method (2 -ΔCt) with a housekeeping gene (RPLP0). Total RNA will be extracted from frozen 
muscle and adipose biopsy samples as described (87). Adipose tissue samples taken before and after 
the intervention will be analyzed for macrophage and inflammatory gene expression (IL -6 and TNF -α 
expression, F4/80, CD68, EMR1,CD11b, MIP -1a, CCL3 -R) to determine if administration of TUDCA 
affects markers of adipose tissue inflammation. We predict that treatment with TUDCA will reduce signs 
of ER stress in adipose tissue, but not skeletal muscle, of study subjects treated with PI -ART.  
In vitro studies: If, as predicted, TUDCA reduces ER stress in adipose tissue above,  the effects could be 
direct effects of TUDCA as a chemical chaperone in adipocytes or could be secondary to systemic 
improvements in insulin sensitivity and metabolism. To address this issue, the human adipocyte cell line 
(Lisa -2; provided by the NORC ABC ) will be cultured and differentiated in vitro. Adipocytes will then be 
treated with RTV and/or TUDCA as described for the human skeletal myocytes in prelim studies. 
Endpoints will include markers of ER stress, insulin signaling, and 2 -DG uptake. Based on preliminary 
studies and published work showing that PI -ART activates ER stress in adipocytes (19, 88, 89)  we predict 
Tauroursodeoxycholic acid for protease -inhibitor associated insulin resistance  
PI: Reeds  
21 
 that treatment of adipocytes with RTV will activate the ER stress response and  impair insulin signaling 
and glucose uptake and that TUDCA will attenuate or reverse these effects of RTV.  
Finally, it is also possible that the ability of TUDCA to ameliorate ER stress could be blocked by loss of 
TGR5 signaling. Though this would seem t o be a more unlikely possibility, the mechanism whereby 
TUDCA ameliorates ER stress is not known, and could involve TGR5 signaling. To test this ideas, TGR5 
will be knocked down by using siRNA (as described for myocytes) and the ability of TUDCA to amelior ate 
ER stress and improve insulin responsiveness in adipocytes will be examined. These mechanistic studies 
would provide a significant conceptual advance for the field by establishing the mechanism whereby 
these effects occur.    
E 2.C  
Randomization.  Participants will be randomized to TUDCA or placebo. A computer -based randomization 
scheme will be established, as used in our prior research protocols (90) and group assignment will be 
stratified by race and gender. The study statistician, Dr. Schechtman, who wi ll be unblinded to group 
assignment, will provide ongoing oversight to ensure groups are well matched on key characteristics 
(age, BMI, race, gender). Capsules containing TUDCA and matching placebo will be made by our 
research pharmacy, as has been perform ed in our other placebo -controlled studies (90). The PI, subjects 
and research technicians will be blinded with respect to group assignment. The coordinator will also be 
unblinded to group assignment. In the event of an adverse event the coordinator will inform the team and 
subject of group assignment.  Melisa Moore RN and Rebecca Basham RN will be unblinded to ensure 
that group assignment is known in the case a subject require s urgent medical care.  
Sample Size and statistical power: All power computations are based on two -sided tests at the 0.05 
level of significance for the primary outcomes  of change of 1) insulin -stimulated glucose disposal ( SA#1 ), 
2) type 2 deiodinase expres sion in skeletal muscle ( SA#2 ) and 3) Grp78 expression in adipose tissue 
(SA#3 ) after the intervention.  
Significance of primary outcomes:  Change in insulin -stimulated glucose disappearance is clinically 
relevant as a predictor of diabetes risk and is high ly reproducible in our hands, improving statistical power 
(91). D2 and Grp78 expression are robust markers of TGR5 activation and ER stress, respectively, and 
will therefore clarify the mechanisms through which TUDCA may act to improve insulin sensitivity.  
Estimates of change in the primary outcomes : The estimates for the anticipated changes in the primary 
endpoints of glucose disposal and D2 expression are based on the prior study conducted in obese, insulin 
resistant subjects. In this study, glucose rate of disappearance improved by 30±23% and D2 e xpression 
in muscle increased 2.4±2.5 fold (Fig 10) after the TUDCA intervention (43). The estimate for the change 
in Grp78 expression following initiation of TUDCA is based on improvements seen in animal studies with 
use of TUDCA (52, 53)  and in humans after undergoing gastric bypass (92). Based on these findings we 
estimate a 50±25% change in Grp78 in the TUDCA group with no change in the placebo group.  
G  
G1. Statistical analysis :  Preliminary analyses will include analysis of variance and chi square tests that 
focus on ensuring that the groups are similar at baseline.  The primary analytic approach will be analysis 
of covariance in which the dependent variable will be the post in tervention value of the outcome measure 
Tauroursodeoxycholic acid for protease -inhibitor associated insulin resistance  
PI: Reeds  
22 
 and the independent variables will be the study group and the baseline value of the outcome.  This will 
allow us to test hypotheses about the equality of post intervention values after adjusting for the baseline 
value.  In these analyses, we will be specifically interested in the statistical contrasts that compare the 
groups with and without TUDCA.  The appropriateness of all analysis of variance and covariance models 
will be evaluated using regression residuals.  If normality or homoscedasticity requirements are violated, 
data transformations will be explored and, if appropriate transformations cannot be found, analyses may 
be done semi -parametrically using the ranks of the data.  
G2. Power Estimates for each primary endpoint:  We have conservatively estimated the improvements 
in our primary endpoints. We plan to include 24 subjects in each group and conservatively estimate a 
33% drop -out rate.  These drop -out rates are greater than those seen in our prior studies in HIV + people 
using longer duration interventions that have high drop -out rates such as exercise (10% drop -out) or yoga 
(15% drop -out) (32, 93) .  
The above data have the following implications with respect to statistical power (see Table).  The 
anticipated treatment induced improvement in the glucose disappearance rate of 30 + 23% implies that 
a sample size of only 16 yields a power of 0.95 (SA#1).  The expectation that TUDCA will increase D2 
expression in muscle by 2.4 + 2.5 yields a power of 0.8 5 with 16 subjects per group (SA#2) .  Finally  the 
expected change of 50 + 25% in Grp78 in the TUDCA group implies that only 7 subjects per group are 
needed to achieve a power of 0.93 (SA#3) . In summary, our sample size selection implies that the power 
associated with the glucose disappearance rate (SA#1) and Grp78 (SA#3) will exceed 0.9 while the 
power associated with D2 expression will be 0.85.

H. Protection of human subjects.  
H1. Risk to subjects.    Blood and tissue samples will be collected from all subjects.  The specimens will 
be obtained solely for research purposes.  Study samples and data sheets will be coded with an 
identification number for each subject.  All of the data from individual subjects will be maintained 
confidentially and their names and identities will not be disclosed in any published document. The PI, 
coordinator and Dr. Presti are covered by a certificate of confidentially carried by the ACTU.  
Potential risks of the study include: 1) t he risks of catheter insertion and blood drawing include discomfort, 
bleeding or infection at the site of insertion; 2) t he infusion of hormones may cause changes in blood 
glucose and may cause nausea, however, blood  glucose is monitored throughout the study; 3)  biopsies 
of muscle and adipose tissue can cause pain, bleeding, and infection ; 4) magn etic resonance 
spectroscopy  and MRI can be harmful for people with metal implants in their bodies, and may cause 
discomfort in people with claustrophobia; (those with implants or history of claustrophobia will be 
excluded ); 5) if an arterial line is placed, a blood clot can occur at the site  of the catheter insertion and 
could decrease blood flow to the hand causing tissue damage (however, the risk of this is extremely small 
because only a small size catheter is used and it is kept in for a short period of time; furthermore, before 
catheter p lacement, the hand i s examined to ensure adequate blood flow);  6) the risks of infusing stable 
isotope tracers include the possibility of pyrogen response or infection; however, all solutions will be 
tested for pyrogens and sterility before infusion and wi ll be administered under strict aseptic conditions; 
there are no known short - or long -term risks associated with the infusion of the isotopes themselves; 7) 
the effect of TUDCA on ART absorption and handling is not known therefore we will enrol only subjec ts 
with controlled HIV and will monitor CD4 counts and viral load upon completion of this brief study. These 
results will be reviewed by the DSMB to ensure patient safety.   
Adequacy of protection against risks.   All experimental procedures will be explain ed in writing and orally 
to the subject by the principal investigator, co -investigator, or the research coordinator. Written informed 
consent will be obtained after all questions have been answered and the risks and benefits of participation 
in the study h ave been described. The objectives of the project, all of the requirements for participation, 
and any possible discomforts and risks will be clearly explained to each subject orally and in writing in 
lay terms that he/she is able to comprehend. The subject  must sign a consent form, approved by the 
Washington University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board, before participating in any aspect

 of the study.  To secure data transfer between WUMS and VUMS, a Secure File Transfer system will be 
used to t ransmit any PHI or study -related data.  An original copy of each consent will be kept on file at the 
primary site with an additional signed consent at VUMS. At each site all data will be kept within a secure 
server and will be deidentified at the closure of  the study.  
H2 Compliance Program : During the  intervention , subjects will be seen weekly by a member of the 
research team who will take weight, measure blood pressure and pulse, review any problems and  verify 
compliance by using a pill count. Should the need for medical evaluation arise, they will be seen by the 
PI,Dr. Presti, Dr Hulgan, Dr. Koethe all  of who m are certified in Internal Medicine.  
 Should the need for medical attention arise all the resources of a large teaching hospital at each 
site are a vailable for subject evaluation and treatment. Complete physical examinations will be performed 
to screen out subjects who may be at potential risk.  Subjects will be carefully monitored by the medical 
staff associated with the study for the duration of th e study.  
Potential benefits of the proposed research to the subjects and others.   Potential benefits to the subjects 
participating in the study include information regarding their medical health, and screening for diabetes.  
Benefits to society include a better understanding of the factors responsible for insulin resistance in HIV  
and the mechanisms through which bile acids may improve these outcomes .  
Importance of the knowledge to be gained.  This study will provide important information regarding the 
causes of insulin resistance in HIV and will test the efficacy of a new modality. The risks associated with 
this research are minimal relative to the clinical implications of this study, which could lead to better 
therapies for preventing and treating the met abolic complications of PI -ART. 
H3 Data and safety monitoring.  Data from the study will be monitored on a continuous basis by the PI, 
co-investigators, study research nurse, and research coordinator.  The PI, study research nurse, research 
coordinator, and  postdoctoral research fellow will meet weekly to review any study issues. The PI, study 
research nurse, and research coordinator will review all serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events 
(AEs), and laboratory values.  Dr. Hulgan, the study research nurse and coordinator at VUMS will also 
discuss weekly eligible or enrolled subjects. In the event of an SAE or reportable event, Dr Hulgan or 
Koethe will contact Dr. Reeds within 24 hours. The Washington University Human Res earch Protection 
Office (HRPO) will be notified as a reportable event within 10 days of knowledge of the event.  Follow -up 
will be performed as additional information becomes available.  In addition, all laboratory values outside 
of normal range which plac e the participant at risk are discussed with the study participant and 
appropriate arrangements will be made for treatment, if necessary.  Data from the study will be monitored 
on a continuous basis by the PI, co -investigators, research coordinator, and re search study nurse.  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board, consisting of Shelby Sullivan, M.D. (Gastroenterologist), David 
Alpers. (Gastroenterologist), and David Clifford, M.D. (Infectious Diseases), will be available for 
discussion at any time with the PI to review any safety issues. All data will be treated confidentially and 
the subjects' names and identities will not be disclosed in any published reports. The subjects will be 
informed orally and in writing that they are free to withdraw from the study at  any time with no bias or 
prejudice. The data obtained from this study will be kept confidential and no subjects will be identified in 
any written publications. Patients are assigned a study specific identifying number upon entry to the 
study, after which all medical information is referenced by this number.  Clinic records are maintained in 
locked file cabinets within a locked room.

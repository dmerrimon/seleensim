2, Study Synopsis  -Based on pre -clinical data suggesting that the activation and 
expansion of CMV pp -65-specific T cells can be enhanced 
through modification of the RNA encoding pp65 with a full -
length LAMP fusion protein, influenza virus matrix M1 was 
replaced with full -length LAMP protein.  
-Saline skin prep was removed and all subjects randomized to 
receive DCs will receive Td skin prep based on clinical data 
showing prolonged survival.  
-To serve as a true control, GM -CSF was removed from the 
PBMC arm.  
-Reference to Nature paper was added.  
-The primary objective was modified to evaluate the impact of 
Td on overall survival.  
-The secondary objectives were modified to evaluate 
progression -free survival and immunologic effects of short 
versus full -length LAMP.  
-Modifications were made to clarify inclusion criteria and 
timing of eligibility assessments.  
-Since manufacturing processes are different among the arms, 
the study design was changed to “single -blind”.    
-Randomization was changed to “prior to leukapheresis” to 
allow for adequate manufacturing time for each arm.  
-MRI/MRS imaging of inguinal lymph nodes replaced 
SPECT/CT imaging as the method to assess the impact of DC 
vaccination and unpulsed PBMC vaccination at inguinal 
draining lymph nodes.  
-Immune monitoring time points were expanded to include 
collection around MRI/MRS.

CONFIDENTIAL  20170801  1, Study Synopsis  
8.1, Inclusion 
Criteria  
 - Inclusion criterion #2 revised to provide clarification of 
the histopathologic diagnosis eligible for participation in 
this clinical trial. Variants of Glioblastoma WHO Grade 
IV are eligible for  enroll ment . 
- Inclusion criterion #3 revised to remove Cytomegalovirus 
(CMV) seropositive status as a requirement for 
participation in this trial.  Serology testing remains in the 
protocol and will be used to stratify randomization. During 
the first year of study enroll ment, we observed an 
unexpectedly low frequency of CMV seropositivity 
(patients with circulating antibodies to CMV) in the GBM 
patient population.  While not used as eligibility in Phase I 
trials (Mitchell et al., Nature 2015 and Batich et al., Clin 
Can Re s 2017), CMV seropositivity was included as an 
inclusion criterion for this Phase II trial to ensure similar 
immunologic exposure to the CMV virus across enrolled 
subjects on the vaccine and control arms.  Based on 
published reports of the CMV exposure for  individuals 
older than 50 years old, a frequency of 60 -90% 
seropositivity would have been expected.   Thus far, we 
have detected circulating CMV antibodies in only 33% of 
our clinic/inpatient GBM patients which is unexpectedly 
low for older individuals, a nd suggests, a possible false 
negative rate in patients, possibly secondary to 
immunosuppression.  Supportive of this notion, a 
publication in OncoImmunology from a virology group at 
Karolinska Institute noted “Discordant humoral and 
cellular immune respon ses to Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in 
glioblastoma patients whose tumors are positive for 
CMV” (Rahbar et al., OncoImmunology 2015).  In the 
conclusion of this paper the authors noted, “In GBM 
patients, HCMV activity is higher than in healthy controls 
and serolo gy is a poor test to define previous or active 
HCMV infection in these patients.”  We plan to analyze 
retrospectively whether CMV seropositivity impacts on 
immunologic response and clinical outcomes to 
vaccination.

9.1 Overview, 
10.5 At 
Progression  - Blood samples for immunologic monitoring will be obtained 
at progression if feasible.  
9.8 DC or PBMC 
Vaccination  - Provision added to allow participants to received generated 
vaccines when they no longer meet protocol requirement 
other than progression. They will be replaced for purpose of 
study endpoints if they do not meet criteria of an evaluable 
subject.  
10.7 Schedule of 
Study 
Assessments  - Footnotes updated for consistency with protocol 
requirements.  
13.1 Dose -
limiting Toxicity  - Stopping rules revised to continuously monitor vaccine -
related toxicity  at an acceptable toxicity rate of 1 patient in 
7.  
15.2 Sample Size 
Justification for 
Vaccine 
Comparison  - Section revised to state that Interim analysis will occur after 
40 observed deaths. This correspond to a trial “information 
fraction” of 52% . Interim analysis was initially planned at 24 
months. However, due to accrual rate, these numbers events 
were not observed at 24 months.  
20181108  Synopsis and 9.1, 
Overview  - Statement added to clarify that the subgroup of patients who 
were disqualified prior to receiving the 1st vaccine, may be 
allowed to receive vaccines that are already generated. They 
will not count toward the study endpoints but will be 
monitored for toxicities.  
20190415  Synopsis and 8.1 
Inclusion Criteria  - Inclusion criteria language related to completion of radiation 
therapy was modified to remove target dose of radiation, to 
clarify that the intent is to include patients who complete 
standard dose therapy with allowance for routine clinical 
management decisions such as dose modification to allow 
safe standard -of-care radiation delivery and chemotherapy 
treatment.  
9.4, Radiation 
Therapy  - Revised for internal consistency.

timeframe was added to limit/avoid treatment 
interruption/delay.  
9.8 - Clarified that missed vaccines during Cycles 1 -8 may be 
given with subsequent cycles of Temozolomide (or monthly 
for patients off Temozolomide) until patients receive a total 
of 10 vaccines if there is no tumor progression.  
10.3, 
Chemoradiation  - Revised for internal consistency.  
10.7 - Footnote related to radiation therapy update for internal 
consistency.

toxicity and primary and secondary endpoints.  
18.1, Appendix 
A: Radiation 
Therapy  
 - Revised for internal consistency.  
201906 21 13.1 Dose -
Limiting Toxicity  - Section revised to allow for a longer period of clinical 
management (changed from 48 hours to 4 weeks) of 
potential drug -related Grade III neurologic toxicity to more 
closely align with immunotherapy trials for other cancers as 
well as standard clinical ma nagement guidelines.   Immune -
related neuro toxicities are a recognized potential adverse 
event of immunotherapy. Symptoms may present throughout 
the course of treatment and involve the peripheral and 
central nervous system and usually respond well to stero ids, 
if started early. Management of patients with immune -
related adverse events includes treatment with a 4 -week 
steroid taper.   Resumption of therapy can occur if  a 
neurotoxic AE is improved to Grade II or lower within 4 
weeks of clinical management.  However, if  Grade III  
neurologic toxicity is observed again with subsequent study 
vaccines , a DLT will be declared and the patient will not 
receive additional study vaccines.  
- Surgical intervention to reverse neurological toxicity will 
not constitute DLT if the toxicity is reversed within 4 weeks. 
Immune response may induce inflammation of CNS tissue. 
Surgical intervention may be required for decompression 
and removal of necrotic tissue to reduce cerebral edema.  
 13.2 Stopping 
Rules  - Section title added for clarity. Language related to stopping 
rules are unchanged . 
20190820  Title Page  - UF key personnel updated for accuracy.

CONFIDENTIAL  13.1 Dose -
Limiting Toxicity  - NCI CTCAE for AE grading revised from Version 4.0 to 
Version 5.0 per FDA’s recommendation.  
- The definition of drug -related has been revised for clarity 
per FDA’s recommendation.  
- In consultation with FDA following agency review of 
protocol version 20190621, the dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) 
definition, criteria and management have been modified to 
address FDA  recommendations related to potential toxicities 
that may result from a longer period of clinical management.  
Specifically, the protocol has been revised to include a two-
stage management plan for declaring a possible DLT: 1) a 7 
day period for improvement of neurologic symptoms after 
medical intervention to grade 2 or better an d 2) a 21 -day 
period for return to baseline or improvement to grade I or 
better.  
- In consultation with FDA following agency review of 
protocol version 20190621, criteria for resumption of 
treatment has been modified to allow continued  treatment 
only if neurotoxicity is improved to grade 1 or better or to 
patient’s baseline status . 
13.3 Adverse 
Events  
18.1 Appendix A  - CTCAE version updated to 5.0 for internal consistency.  
20191101  Title Page  - Updated sponsor for IND 16530 to Immunomic

15.1 Study 
Design Overview  
 - Sections revised to increase total enrollment number to 
reach the study target of 120 evaluable subjects . The study 
target of 120 evaluable patients ( defined as having received 
at least one study vaccine) as described in section 15.2 
Sample Size Justification for Vaccine Comparison remained 
unchanged. However, total enrollment number is required to 
achieve this goal due to screen -failures, subject  withdrawals 
prior to vaccination and early progression or AEs that 
preclude vaccination. Based on the enrollmen t and 
withdrawal numbers since study activation, we expect that 
up to 175 patients will be need to achieve the study goal of 
120 evaluable patients.

patients will be done by initial assessment of disease status 
by the treating neuro -oncolo gist/study investigators, upon 
review of surveillance brain MRI during routine clinic visit 
followed by study vaccine administration or chemo cycle 
initiation. Clinical assessment of disease status will be 
followed by formal measurements of enhancing lesions fo r

15.3.2 Secondary 
Biological 
Objectives   
 - The planned interim analysis was designed to halt enrollment 
early if results demonstrated unlikely benefit and was 
anticipated after 2 years of enrollment with anticipated 40 
events (deaths) to power the analysis. To date after more than 
four years of enr ollment and a total of 132 patients enrolled 
on the study, we have just crossed the threshold of events for 
an interim analysis and anticipate enrollment for only an 
additional 10 -12 months. The factors that have contributed to 
such a long interval before reaching threshold of events are 
slower monthly accrual than original projected but also 
potentially longer overall survival in the treated population of 
GBM patients than modeled in the interim analysis plan. 
Additionally, the immunotherapy treatment has been well 
tolerated in patients with only 2   Grade 3 or greater AEs 
associated with immunotherapy treatment amongst all treated 
subjects. Therefore, the study team and sponsor have 
determined that completion of enrollment on the study is the 
appropriate re search plan for study completion and will forgo 
the interim analysis.

 STUDY SYNOP SIS  
 
Title  ATTAC -II:  A Phase II Randomized, Blinded, and Placebo -controlled Trial of CMV RN A-
Pulsed Dendritic Cells with Tetanus -Diphtheria Toxoid V accine in Patients with Newly -
Diagnosed Glioblastoma   
Study Drug s: Autologous  dendritic cells  (DCs) derived from PBMC loaded with RNA encoding the human 
cytomegalovirus  (CMV)  matrix protein  pp65 as a fusion protein with the short targeting 
peptide from lysosomal membrane associated protein (pp65 -shLAMP) plus GM -CSF and 
tetanus -diphtheria (Td) vaccine as adjuvants; autologous DCs derived from PBMC loaded 
with pp65 RNA as a fusion protein with full-length LAMP protein (pp65 -flLAMP) plus GM -
CSF and Td as adjuvants; or autologous unpulsed PBMCs administered as a control vaccin e. 
Rationale:  CMV antigens have been identified in glioblastoma (GBM) and may make excellent anti -
tumor immunotherapeutic targets.  Vaccination and adoptive T -cell strategies targeting CMV  
in humans in other contexts have been safe and effective. Our prior studies examining patients 
with GBM have demonstrated the feasibility, safety, immunogenicity, and potential clinical 
efficacy of this approach  (Mitchell and Batich et al., Nature 2015) . Temozolomide (TMZ) has 
recently shown modest efficacy, but is not curative, in some patients with newly diagnosed 
GBM and is now routinely  given to these patients during and after radiation therapy (RT). 
Therapeutic TMZ induces a profound lymphopenia, however, that may inhibit anti -tumor 
vaccination. We have demonstrated, however, that repeated vaccination during recovery from 
cycles of lymphodepletive temozolomide can induce potent humoral and cellular 
immunologic responses.  
 
Granulocyte macrophage -colony stimulating factor  (GM-CSF) is a powerful adjuvant capable 
of stimulating macrophage function, inducing proliferation and maturation of DCs, and is able 
to enhance T -lymphocyte stimulatory function .  Intradermal administration of GM -CSF 
enhances the immunization efficacy at the site of administration in a dose dependent fashion.   
Significant anti -tumor immunity has been demonstrated in preclinical murine studies in which 
irradiated, stably transfected tumor cell lines secreting  GM-CSF has protected against 
subsequent tumor challenge, especially against intracerebral tumors.  
 
Tetanus toxoid  (Td) is a routinely used vaccine in the normal human population that we have 
shown in pilot studies may function as a potent adjuvant to enhance DC trafficking to vaccine -
site draining lymph nodes (VDLNs). Our previous studies have shown that successful DC 
migration to VDLNs may be a requisite for clinical activity of RNA -pulsed DCs  and 
administration of Td prior to vaccination may improve the effectiveness of DC vaccines in 
patients with GBM.  
Primary 
Objective:  1. To determine whether the addition of pp65 -LAMP mRNA DC vaccine plus GM -CSF and 
Td to dose -intensified TMZ treatment is worthy of investigation in a large phase III study  
based on impact on overall survival . 
Secondary 
Objectives:  1. Evaluate the impact of CMV pp65 -LAMP RNA -pulsed DC vaccines on progression -free 
survival in patients with newly -diagnosed GBM .  
2. Determine the immunologic effects of vaccination with pp65 RNA fusion constructs 
incorporating full -length LAMP vs short LAMP sequences . 
Inclusion

To be assessed prior to initiation of adjuvant TMZ : 
• Patient did not start RT and TMZ within 7 weeks of surgery.  
• Progression of disease as defined by modified RANO criteria . 
• More than 45 days after completion of RT and TMZ . 
Study Design:  The eligibility criteria for this trial will be similar to those used in the RTOG 0525 study 
(Aldape 2009 ).  Prior to the initiation of TMZ and external beam RT, patients will sign consent 
and undergo leukapheresis for PBMCs  in accordance with SOP -UFBTIP -131.  
 
Up to 200 newly diagnosed  WHO Grade IV glioma  patients will be enrolled in the study. 
Eligible patients will be randomized, undergo leukapher esis and receive “standard -of-care” 
radiotherapy concurrent with TMZ under the assumption that approximately 120 patients will 
be vaccinated according to treatment arm in this placebo -controlled, single -blinded, 
randomized Phase II study.  
 
Prior to leukapheresis , patients will be r andomized  to receive one of three  treatment regimens 
with dose-intensified TMZ treatment at 100 mg/m2/day for 21 days  with an allocation ratio of 
1:1:1 into  one of three  arms to receive:  
 
1)  pp65 -shLAMP  mRNA DCs with GM -CSF 150 µg (Td skin prep)  
2)  pp65 -flLAMP  mRNA DCs with GM -CSF 150 µg (Td skin prep)  
3)  Unpulsed PBMCs  (saline  skin prep)  
 
Randomization will be stratified by : 
- Age 69 years old and younger, who will receive dose -intensified adjuvant 
temozolomide; or 70 years old and older who will receive standard dose adjuvant 
temozolomide.   
- Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) class (III, IV, or V)  
- CMV seronegative or seropositive  
 
Within 7 weeks of surgery, p atients will undergo standard RT with concurrent TMZ at a target 
dose of 75 mg/m2/day.   
 
ATTAC -II   Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy  
Version: 20241007  Page 33 of 121 
CONFIDENTIAL  Patients will receive the initial cycle of TMZ 4 (+/- 1) weeks after completing RT. Study drugs  
will be given intradermally at day 22 -24 after the first TMZ cycle and divided equally between  
both inguinal regions  in accordance with SOP -UFBTIP -128. All patients will receive Td 
booster (5 Lf) with vaccine #1 regardless of booster history.  Vaccine #2 and #3 will occur at 
2 week intervals.  
 
All patients will undergo repeat leukapheresis 2 to 4 weeks after vaccine #3 for PBMCs to 
generate additional DC vaccines and for immunologic monitoring with specific assessment of 
baseline antigen -specific cellular and humoral immune responses .  TMZ cycle 2 will occur 24 
hours to 1 week after repeat leukapheresis.  Patient s may undergo additional leukapheresis if 
needed to generate up to 10 DC vaccines.  
 
Patients will then be vaccinated monthly in conjunction with subsequent TMZ cycles every 
5(+/- 1) weeks for a total of 6 to 12 cycles after RT as per guidelines defined in recent phase 
III clinical trial evaluating TMZ regimens in patients with GBM (RTOG  0525).  Vaccines will 
be given on day 22 -24 of each TMZ cycle.  Patients will continue with monthly vaccinations 
until a total of 10 vaccines have been administered or until tumor progression (whichever 
comes first).   
 
All patients will undergo vaccine site pretreatment with Td (1 Lf) or saline (depending on 
randomization arm) 6 -24 hours prior to Vaccine # 3, #6, and # 9.  At vaccine #3, patients at the 
UF site will undergo MRI/MRS imaging of inguinal vacci ne-site draining lymph nodes before 
vaccine site pretreatment, 48hrs post vaccination, and 5 to 7 d ays post vaccination (optional) . 
 
Patients who have been enrolled in the study and become ineligible to receive study treatment 
for reasons other than progression may be allowed to receive vaccines that have been 
generated  at the discretion of the PI as outlined in section 9.8 , DC or PBMC Vaccination.  
 
Blood for immune monitoring will be collected during initial leukapheresis, prior to vaccines 
1-3, during MRI/MRS imaging time points surrounding vaccine #3, during the second 
leukapheresis, prior to vaccine 4, 7, 10, and at progression  if feasible .  Peripheral blood will 
be processed in accordance with SOP -UFBTIP -126.   Urine samples will be collected at 
MRI/MRS imaging time points surrounding vaccine #3 and transferred to th e UFBTIP 
laboratory for nMR analysis.  
 
Up to twelve cycles of TMZ may be given if the patient demonstrates continued improvement 
or stability on radiologic scan, decreased corticosteroid requirement, improvement in 
performance status, or improvement in neurologic function.  
 
Patients will be imaged  bimonthly during TMZ cycles and every 3  months after the 12th TMZ 
cycle (or 1 year post surgery if TMZ discontinued prior to 12 cycles)  without receiving any 
other prescribed antitumor therapy unless progression occurs . 
 
The primary measure of response will be by serial measures of the product of the two largest 
cross -sectional diameters.  The modified RANO criteria  (Ellingson, Wen, Cloughesy 2017) 
will be used for assessment of pseudoprogression , progression or response.

CONFIDENTIAL   
Tumor progression will need to be documented histologically, unless there are clinical 
contraindications, to exclude inflammatory responses presenting as radiographic or clinical 
changes, which could indicate potentially toxic or therapeutic responses and not tumor 
progression. As this is not a research procedure, consent for biopsy will be obtained 
separately. If tissue is obtained, it will be used to confirm tumor progression histologically 
and evaluate cellular infiltration and CMV antigen expression at the tumor site.   
 
If histopathology confirms treatment effect vs tumor progression patient may resume study 
treatment at the discretion of the PI in consultation with the treating physician, if  the 
PI believes that it is safe to continue therapy and that patients may benefit from the ongoing 
treatment regimen  as described in section 11.11 Confirmation of Tumor Progression by 
Histopathology.  
 
Patients will be followed until death due to any cause. MRI and clinical evaluation for 
assessment of disease progression will be conducted bi -monthly for the first 12 months and 
then every 3 months thereafter.

 ABSTRACT  
 
Despite aggressive, computer -guided surgery, high -dose focused radiation, and toxic, multi -
mechanistic chemotherapy, malignant gliomas (MGs) remain almost universally fatal.  Moreover, 
these inherently non -specific conventional treatments incapacitate patients as a result of damage 
to surrounding normal brain and systemic tissues (Imperato, Paleologos et al. 1990 ).  The inherent 
biologic specificity of immunotherapy, however, offers the prospect of targeting neoplastic cells 
more precisely.  DCs are endowed with an extraordinary ability to activate CD4+ and CD8+ T-
cells(Banchereau and Steinman 1998 ; Steinman 2001 ), and DCs loaded with antigens derived from 
tumor cells have the potential to induce potent anti -tumor immunity.  Unfortunately, the inherent 
genetic instability of tumor cells severely limits the number of conserved, homogeneously -
expressed, and immunogenic tumor -specific antigens.  
 
The discovery that MGs, but not surrounding normal brain tissue, serve as a refuge for CMV 
reactivation (Cobbs, Harkins et al. 2002 ) provide an unparalleled opportunity to subvert, as tumor -
specific antigens, the highly immunogenic viral proteins expressed by human CMV.  The 
immunologic responses to CMV have been well -characterized and the immunodominant viral 
protein pp65 is highly -conserved.  Finally, CMV -specific immunotherapy has been previously 
shown in humans to be safe and efficacious in combating CMV related disease within the central 
nervous system (CNS) (Bigger, Tanigawa et al. 1999 ), and antitumor immunotherapy targeting 
viral proteins in human CNS tumors associated with Epstein -Barr virus (EBV), another 
Herpesvirus , have been curative (Emanuel 1991 ; Papadopoulos, Ladanyi et al. 1994 ; Emanuel, 
Lucas et al. 1997 ; Rooney, Smith et al. 1998 ; Lucas and Barrett 1999 ; Liu, Savoldo et al. 2002 ).  
Similarly, vaccinations directed against the highly immunogenic antigens of human papilloma 
virus have recently been shown to reduce the incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in a 
prospective, randomized, double -blind trial (Koutsky, Ault et al. 2002 ). 
 
Chemotherapeutic agents frequently used in cancer therapy, however, often induce a profound 
lymphopenia that may inhibit even the most potent anti -tumor immune responses.  TMZ , a 
methylating chemotherapeutic agent, has recently shown efficacy in some patients with newly 
diagnosed GBM (Stupp, Mason et al. 2005 ) and is now routinely given to these patients during and 
after RT .  Therapeutic TMZ , however, also induces a profound lymphopenia.  
 
Human CMV  antigens have been shown by a number of laboratories to be expressed in a high 
proportion (>90%) of malignant gliomas. We have recently completed a phase I /II clinical trial 
exploring the safety, immunogenicity, and potential clinical efficacy of autologous pp65 RNA -
pulsed DC vaccines in patients with newly -diagnosed GBM.  This trial explored the capacity to 
enhance DC migration to VDLNs using inflammatory skin preparations administered prior to pp65 
RNA -loaded DC vaccines in a randomized pilot tr ial design (n=12 patients).  The results of these 
studies demonstrated the capacity to safely expand CMV -specific cellular and humoral immunity 
in patients with  GBM using autologous  pp65  RNA -pulsed DC vaccines and demonstrated a strong 
correlation with successful DC migration to VDLNs and clinical outcomes (R=0.73, P=0.007; 
Pearson correlation coefficient) .  Strikingly, patients randomized to receive a tetanus toxoid 
booster as an inflammatory stimulus at the vaccine -site showed an increased migration of DC s to 
VDLNs (P=0.04) and a corresponding increased progression -free and overall survival (P=0.01 
Logrank analysis) .  These results suggested that successful DC trafficking in vivo  is associated

Version: 20241007  Page 37 of 121 
CONFIDENTIAL  with improved outcomes in patients with GBM receiving pp65 RNA -pulsed DC vaccines and that 
inflammatory stimuli that enhance DC migration improve the efficacy of this treatment modality.  
In support of this hypothesis, we found increased levels of chemokin es that facilitate DC migration 
in patients randomized to the tetanus group.  Additionally, we have corroborated these findings 
using a transgenic mouse model employing GFP+ mice to evaluate DC migration.  Pp65 RNA -
pulsed DCs are a novel and promising ther apeutic modality for patients with GBM, and our studies 
indicate that DC migration to VDLNs constitutes a major biological axis for potential clinical 
intervention in order to enhance the efficacy of this treatment strategy.   
 
Studies within our laboratory have demonstrated that the activation and expansion of CMV pp65 -
specific T cells can be enhanced through modification of the RNA encoding pp65 with a full -
length LAMP fusion protein.  The fusion of antigenic proteins to LAMP c hannels antigens 
synthesized within the cytosol into the class II presentation pathway leading to enhanced CD4+ T 
cell activation and CTL induction. In the previous ATTAC trial, the CMV pp65 RNA construct 
encoded for a short peptide signal sequence from th e LAMP protein which has been shown to 
channel proteins into the lysosomal processing pathway.  We compared short LAMP signal 
sequence fusions of CMV pp65 to fusions with the full -length LAMP protein and found full -length 
LAMP led to superior T cell expans ion.  
 
In this trial, we will evaluate  in a randomized, single -blinded phase 2 clinical trial whether th e 
clinical efficacy of pp65 RNA -pulsed DCs is worthy of investigation in a definitive phase III 
clinical trial .  We will also examine whether immunologic responses to the full -length LAMP and 
short sequence LAMP fusion constructs differ significantly in vaccinated patients.  
  
 HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES

survival . 
▪ Secondary hypotheses are that:  
o There is a relationship  between CMV pp65 -LAMP RNA -pulsed DC 
vaccines and progression -free survival in vaccinated patients .

 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
6.1 Disease and Current Therapy  
Malignant primary brain tumors are more common than Hodgkin’s disease and account for more 
human deaths than melanoma or than cancer of the bladder or kidney. Despite aggressive, 
computer -guided tumor resection (Kelly 1992 ), high -dose external beam RT or brachytherapy, and 
multi -mechanistic chemotherapy delivered at toxic doses, most patients with malignant primary 
brain tumors live <15 months from the time of diagnosis, and patients with recurrent tumors 
usually survive <12 weeks (Walker, Alexander et al. 1978 ; Walker, Green et al. 1980 ; Shapiro 
1986 ; Salford, Brun et al. 1988 ; Dinapoli, Brown et al. 1993 ; Stupp, Mason et al. 2005 ). The 
estimated cost of treatment for each patient with a malignant brain tumor is between $30,000 and 
several hundred thousand dollars annually. Thus, the annual treatment cost alone for these patients, 
not mentioning the lost earning potential of afflicted individuals, is greater than the entire annual 
budget of the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke. In fact, conventional therapy 
for patients with malignant brain tumor is the most expensive medical therapy per quality -adjusted 
life-year saved currently provided in the United States (Pickard, Bailey et al. 1990 ; Ekman and 
Westphal 2005 ). Moreover, the non -specific nature of conventional therapy for brain tumors often 
results in incapacitating damage  to surrounding normal brain and systemic tissues (Imperato, 
Paleologos et al. 1990 ; Hall and Fodstad 1992 ). Thus, in order to be more effective, therapeutic 
strategies will have to precisely target tumor cells while minimizing collateral damage to 
neighboring eloquent cerebral cortex. The rationale for employing the immune system to target 
brain tumors is base d on the premise that the inherent biologic specificity of immunologic 
reactivity could meet the clear need for more specific and precise therapy.  
6.2 Dendritic Cell Immunotherapy  
DCs are potent immunostimulatory cells that continuously sample the antigenic environment of 
the host and specifically activate CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and B -cells (Banchereau and Steinman 
1998 ; Steinman 2001 ). They are at the crossroads of many of the elegant networks of the immune 
system, and DCs represent the most promising contemporary biologic entity for realizing the 
promise of immunotherapy. Potent immune responses and encouraging clinical results have b een 
seen in Phase I and II human clinical trials in systemic cancers (Hsu, Benike et al. 1996 ; Murphy, 
Tjoa et al. 1996 ; Nestle, Alijagic et al. 1998 ; Salgaller, Lodge et al. 1998 ; Salgaller, Tjoa et al.

CONFIDENTIAL  1998 ; Tjoa, Simmons et al. 1998 ; Fujii, Shimizu et al. 1999 ; Holtl, Rieser et al. 1999 ; Lim and 
Bailey -Wood 1999 ; Morse, Deng et al. 1999 ; Thurner, Haendle et al. 1999 ; Lodge, Jones et al. 
2000 ; Murphy, Tjoa et al. 2000 ; Rieser, Ramoner et al. 2000 ; Schuler -Thurner, Dieckmann et al. 
2000 ; Heiser, Coleman et al. 2002 ; Su, Dannull et al. 2003 ). 
 
Numerous animal studies (Liau, Black et al. 1999 ; Yu, Wheeler et al. 2001 ), including many of our 
own(Ashley, Faiola et al. 1997 ; Heimberger, Crotty et al. 2000 ; Heimberger, Archer et al. 2002 ), 
and a few clinical studies (Yu, Wheeler et al. 2001 ; Liau, Prins et al. 2005 ) have demonstrated 
potent antitumor responses using DC -based immunotherapy against MGs.  
 
Adjuvants frequently used with vaccination include Freund’s incomplete adjuvant, bacilli 
Calmette -Guerin, QS -21, and diphtheria toxoid.  Supplemental cytokines have been used as well 
for the adjuvant immunological effects (Rosenberg, Yang et al. 1998 ). GM -CSF has been 
commonly used, as it is commercially available and well tolerated. GM -CSF is capable of 
stimulating macrophage function, inducing proliferation and maturation of dendritic cells, and is 
able to enhance T -lymphocyte stimulatory function.  Intradermal administration of GM -CSF 
enhances  the immunization efficacy at the site of administration in a dose dependent fashion at an 
optimal dose of 125 g (Kremer, Stevens et al. 2000 ).  Significant anti -tumor immunity has been 
demonstrated in preclinical murine studies in which irradiated, stably transfected tumor cell lines 
secreting GM -CSF have protected against subsequent tumor challenge, especially against 
intracerebral tumors (Sampson, Ashley et al. 1997 ; Mach, Gillessen et al. 2000 ).  Furthermore, the 
potency of GM -CSF has been demonstrated in a Phase I clinical trial in melanoma patients 
vaccinated with irradiated autologous melanoma cells engineered to secrete GM -CSF(Soiffer, 
Lynch et al. 1998 ).  The immunization sites were intensely infiltrated with T lymphocytes, 
dendritic cells, macrophages, and eosinophils in 100% of evaluable patients.  Extensive tumor 
destruction was seen in 11 of 16 patients.  Both cytotoxic T cells and antibody responses  were 
associated with this tumor destruction. Hence, GM -CSF has an extensive track record both as a 
growth factor and an adjuvant, is commercially available and has an acceptable toxicity profile. 
The experience on the ACTIVATE study supports the use of GM -CSF and sets the  precedent for 
this phase I  study.  
 
Td is a routinely used vaccine in the normal human population that we have shown in pilot studies 
may function as a potent adjuvant to enhance DC trafficking to VDLNs. Our previous studies have 
shown that successful DC migration to VDLNs may be a requisite  for clinical activity of RNA -
pulsed DCs and administration of Td prior to vaccination may improve the effectiveness of DC 
vaccines in patients with GBM.  
 
6.2.1 Pre-Clinical Results against Intracerebral Tumors  
In our laboratories and those of others, systemic immunization using DCs co -cultured with 
uncharacterized tumor homogenate (Heimberger, Crotty et al. 2000 ), whole tumor RNA (Ashley, 
Faiola et al. 1997 ), unidentified peptides eluted from tumor cells by gentle acid washing (Liau, 
Black et al. 1999 ), or a distinct peptide encompassing the tumor -specific EGFRvIII 
mutation (Heimberger, Archer et al. 2002 ) have been shown to induce humoral and cell mediated 
systemic immune responses and to prolong the survival of rodents with brain tumors.

CONFIDENTIAL  In prior preclinical studies (Heimberger, Crotty et al. 2000 ), inbred VM/Dk mice received three or 
four weekly intraperitoneal injections of autologous bone marrow -derived DCs transiently co -
cultured with tumor homogenate. The homogenate was derived from a syngeneic murine 
astrocytoma cell line derived  from a spontaneously occurring astrocytoma in the inbred VM/Dk 
mouse strain. Splenocytes from mice immunized in this way were able, in vitro , to lyse the 
astrocytoma cell line that was used to generate the tumor homogenate. They were also able to lyse 
other astrocytoma cell lines derived from the same inbred mouse strain, but they had no effect 
against syngeneic fibroblasts. Similarly, these i mmunized mice also demonstrated a significantly 
increased antibody titer against the astrocytoma cell line used to generate the homogenate. In 
addition, mice immunized with DCs transiently co -cultured with tumor homogenate that were 
subsequently challenged with a lethal dose of this astrocytoma cell line intracerebrally were found 
to have a median survival >160% longer  than those immunized with DCs cultured without tumor 
homogenate ( P=0.016). In addition, 50% of the mice treated with the tumor homogenate -
supplemented DCs survived long -term without any evidence of tumor growth and also survived a 
rechallenge of tumor cel ls indicating that a sustained anti -tumor immune response had been 
established. These findings are especially significant in light of the fact that the astrocytoma cell 
line used is known to secrete the immunosuppressive agent transforming growth factor - (TGF -
) which is secreted by most human gliomas (Kuppner, Hamou et al. 1988 ; Wahl, Hunt et al. 1988 ; 
Zuber, Kuppner et al. 1988 ; Bodmer, Strommer et al. 1989 ; Maxwell, Galanopoulos et al. 1992 ). 
 
In another repor t (Ashley, Faiola et al. 1997 ), C57BL/6 mice received three weekly intraperitoneal 
injections  of autologous bone -marrow derived DCs co -cultured with tumor homogenate or whole 
tumor RNA derived from the poorly immunogenic B16F10 melanoma cell line.  Standard in vitro  
cytotoxicity assays again revealed that splenocytes harvested from mice immunized with DCs 
transiently co -cultured with either tumor -derived homogenate or whole tumor RNA were able to 
lyse B16F10 melanoma cells but not unrelated tumor cells from the same major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) background. In this experiment, mice immuniz ed with autologous bone -marrow 
derived DCs co -cultured with tumor homogenate or whole tumor RNA increased median survival 
by >233% ( P=0.0006) and 48% ( P=0.0001), respectively, relative to mice immunized with DCs 
co-cultured with tumor homogenate or whole tumor RNA derived from an unrelated tumor with 
the same MHC background. In addition, 8/13 (61.5%) in the specific homogenate group and 4/10 
(40%) in the specific RNA group survived beyond the endpoint of the study without evidence of 
tumor. Immunization of mice with pre -existing tumors with specif ic tumor homogenate also 
demonstrated the potency of this immunization approach by increasing survival by 62.5% relative 
to controls. In these mice an inflammatory infiltrate composed of mononuclear cells and 
polymorphonuclear leukocytes was identified onl y in mice treated with DCs co -cultured with 
tumor homogenate that matched the intracerebral tumor challenge.  
 
In a r eport from (Liau, Black et al. 1999 ), the survival of tumor -bearing rats injected 
subcutaneously with autologous bone marrow -derive DCs co -cultured with peptides eluted from 
tumor cells with a gentle acid wash was significantly prolonged compared to tumor -bearing rats 
receiving equivalent nu mbers of DCs co -cultured with peptides acid -eluted from normal astrocytes 
(P< 0.05).  Median survivals in these groups were 35 and 22 days respectively. In addition, three 
of the twelve rats (25%) treated with DCs co -cultured with acid -eluted tumor peptides remained 
alive at the end of the experiment. In addition, immunohistochemic al analysis of five animals from 
each group in this experiment documented an increased peritumoral and intratumoral infiltration

CONFIDENTIAL  of CD8+T -cells, and to a lesser extent CD4+ T-cells and macrophages, in the group treated with 
DCs co -cultured with peptides acid -eluted from tumor cells when compared to controls.  
 
6.2.2 Prior Experience in Patients with Intracerebral Tumors  
The occurrence of human DCs in the peripheral blood is low (0.15% of circulating mononuclear 
cells), and procedures to isolate circulating DCs are cumbersome, relying on negative selection 
techniques to deplete the mononuclear cell fraction of contaminatin g monocytes and lymphocytes.  
Furthermore, brain tumor patients are characteristically imm unosuppressed either from the use of 
steroids or due to the fact that malignant brain tumors secrete immunosuppressive agents like TGF -
.  We have been using a simple  method described previously (Romani, Reider et al. 1996 ), to 
generate human DCs by culturing peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) in media 
supplemented with GM -CSF and interleukin -4 (IL-4).  We have compared the ability to generate 
DCs from  patients with malignant brain tumors and patients undergoing craniotomy for non -tumor 
related procedures.  The phenotype of DCs from both tumor and normal populations were identical 
and were characterized as being highly positive for HLA -ABC and HLA -DR, the co -stimulatory 
molecules CD80 and C D86, and the DC/monocyte marker CD11c, but negative for the monoc yte 
marker CD14.  The cells were negative for the B and natural killer ( NK) cell lineage markers, 
CD19 and CD56, respectively, which is consistent with published DC phenotypes.  
 
DC immunotherapy in patients with MGs  has been evaluated only in a few studies.  In the 
published study by Yu et al. (Yu, Wheeler et al. 2001 ), patients received biweekly intradermal 
injections of peripheral blood derived DCs pulsed with uncharacterized peptides eluted from the 
surface of autologous glioma cells by gentle acid washings.  All patients were required to complete 
a course of RT and were off steroids at the time of immunization.  Toxicity was minimal and 
included only mild fever and lymphadenopathy.  There was no clinical or radiographic evidence 
of autoimmune encephalomyelitis in any patient and no serious adverse events occurre d.  The 
immunization resulted in enhanced cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity in 4/7 patients and both 
cytotoxic and memory T -cells were found to have infiltrated the patient’s tumors whom underwent 
reoperation after immunization.  Although this study was performed in a selected population of 
patients, the median survival of 455 days in the treated group compared very favorably with an 
institutional control group where median survival was only 257 days.  Similarly, when immunized 
patients were compared to Curran’s recursive partition analysis, which controls for know n 
prognostic factors, the results still appeared quite favorable.  Unfortunately, no clinical responses 
were seen and any antigen -specific immune response could not be characterized because t he 
immunizing antigens were not characterized.  
 
A study by Kikuchi et al. (2001) used autologous DCs fused with autologous tumor cells as an 
immunogen in an 8 patient trial.  The immunization schedule consisted of 3 to 7 vaccinations 3 
weeks apart given intradermally.  All vaccinations were well tolerated.  
 
In another  Phase I/II trial , tumor lysate pulsed DCs  were given to ten patients who received 
immunizations every 3 weeks for a minimum of one and a maximum of 10 immunizations.  There 
were only two minor clinical responses seen.  Of 5 patients evaluated by enzyme -linked 
immunospot (ELISPOT ) before and after vaccination T -cells reactive against tumor lysate -pulsed 
DCs were increased in two patients(Yamanaka R, Abe T et al., 2003). In a more recently published 
study, patients with GBM were treated with 1  x 106 to 1 x 107 DCs pulsed with acid eluted 
ATTAC -II   Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy

CONFIDENTIAL  autologous tumor peptides. There was no evidence of 
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT ) or serious adverse 
events. One patient had an objective clinical response 
documented by magnetic resonance imaging, and six 
patients developed measurable systemic antitumor 
CTL responses.  
 
Kikuchi et al. (Kikuchi, Akasaki et al. 2004 ) 
investigated the safety and clinical response to 
immunotherapy using fusions of DCs and glioma 
cells combined with recombinant human IL -12 for 
the treatment of MG. Fifteen patients with MG 
participated in this study. Cultured autologous glioma 
cells were established from surgical specimens in 
each case. Fusion cells were prepared from DCs and 
glioma cells using polyethylene glycol. All patients 
received fusion cell s intradermally on day 1. IL -12 
was injected subcutaneously at the same site on days 
3 and 7. No serious adverse effects were observed. In 
four patients, magnetic resonance imaging showed a 
greater than 50% reduction in tumor size. One patient had a mixe d response.  
 
In a Phase I/II clinical trial (BB IND 9944) at Duke University, patients with newly -diagnosed 
MGs were  vaccinated with mature DCs loaded with a peptide spanning the fusion junction of 
EGFRvIII conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (PEPvIII -KLH)  (500 mcg/immunization), 
mixed with GM -CSF (approx imately 1 50 mcg/immunization) .  EGFRvIII is a tumor specific 
antigen, which is expressed on approximately 47% of all MGs .  The vaccination protocol consist 
of 3 vaccines 2 weeks apart of PEPvIII -
KLH loaded, mature DCs beginning 2 
weeks following completion of post -
resection RT.  19 patients were  enrolled 
with 16 completing vaccination with no 
adverse events.  No patient showed a 
positive delayed -type hypersensitivity 
reaction to KLH or PEPvIII before 
vaccination and of the evaluable patients 
after vaccination, 14/15 (93.3%) patients 
reacted to KLH and 11/15 (73.3 %) reacted 
to PEPvIII.  In vitro  proliferation in 
response to PEPvIII was seen in 11/12 
(92%) and to KLH in 9/12 (75%) of patients 
tested.  Two patients, one  with anaplastic 
astrocytoma and one with GBM with 
residual radiographic disease after 
resection, and radiation, had a nearly 
complete radiographic response (Fig. 1 ).

weeks  with a median overall time to progression of 10.4 months comparing favorably with a 
historical unvaccinated cohort (EGFRvIII positive and gross total resection) that had a median 
TTP of 7.1 months (n=39) .  For patients with GBM, the median survival time was 20.0 months 
which compares favorably with recently published trials evaluating newly -diagnosed patients with 
GBM treated with GLIADEL® (13.9 months) (Westphal, Hilt et al. 2003 ); radiation and  concurrent

antibodies performed at Duke University (18.3 months) (Boskovitz, Wikstrand et al. 2004 ) (Fig. 
2). 
 
6.2.3 RNA Transfected DCs  
The use of RNA to encode tumor antigens for DCs was pioneered at Duke University in Dr. 
Gilboa’s laboratory, but the ability of RNA -loaded DCs to stimulate potent antitumor immunity 
has been independently confirmed in murine and human systems (Boczkowski, Nair et al. 1996 ; 
Van Tendeloo, Ponsaerts et al. 2001 ; Ponsaerts, Van den Bosch et al. 2002 ; Ponsaerts, Van 
Tendeloo et al. 2002 ; Van Meirvenne, Straetman et al. 2002 ; Morse, Nair et al. 2003 ). In fact, there 
is accumulating evidence that RNA transfection represents a superior method for loading antigens 
onto DCs (Strobel, Berchtold et al. 2000 ; Van Tendeloo, Ponsaerts et al. 2001 ). This novel and 
innovative approach to DC antigen loading has multiple conceptual advantages over other forms 
of antigen delivery as well. RNA -based antigen loading does not require knowledge of major MHC 
restriction, and responses are not restricted to s ingle MHC haplotypes or to a narrow B - or T-cell 
repertoire. This diversity increases the likelihood of inducing effective and sustained antitumor 
immune responses by simultaneous activation of both CTLs and helper T -cells(Sercarz, Lehmann 
et al. 1993 ; Kundig, Bachmann et al. 1996 ; Kim, Trivedi et al. 1998 ). Furthermore, in direct 
comparisons, RNA -loaded DCs have been found to be better stimulators of antigen -specific T -
cells than other approaches (Strobel, Berchtold et al. 2000 ). Finally, RNA also carries a significant 
safety advantage, not possessed by other nucleic acid or viral vectors, in that it cannot be integrated 
permanently into the host genome.  In addition to the preliminary data we present below, 
Kobayashi et al. (Kobayashi, Yamanaka et al. 2003 ) have demonstrated that tumor mRNA -loaded 
DCs can elicit a specific CD8+ CTL response against autologous tumor cells in patients with MG. 
6.3 Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis  
DCs, however, have been shown to be quite capable of initiating significant autoimmune responses 
in murine models, and there has been one incident of a spontaneous generalized vitiligo that 
occurred after a second intravenous infusion of DCs in a patient w ith melanoma . Although our 
group and others have demonstrated that DCs loaded with unselected tumor -derived antigens 
induce potent, specific, and clinically effective immune responses against brain tumors in rodent 
models without the induction of autoimmune reactivity (Ashley, Faiola et al. 1997 ; Liau, Black et 
al. 1999 ; Heimberger, Crotty et al. 2000 ; Heimberger, Archer et al. 2002 ), and although no 
autoimmune reactions have been identified in human DC trials in patients with MGs (Yu, Wheeler 
et al. 2001 ; Kikuchi, Akasaki et al. 2004 ; Liau, Prins et al. 2005 ), immunization in preclinical 
studies has only been effective when given before tumor challenge or in the context of very small 
established tumors. These data suggest that for DC -based immunotherapy to be effective in the 
context of large human tumors, a v ery strong and sustained antitumor immune response will be 
required (Ochsenbein, Klenerman et al. 1999 ). In animal models, when such responses have been 
ATTAC -II   Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy  
Version: 20241007  Page 44 of 121 
CONFIDENTIAL  generated against tumor -associated antigens that are shared with host cells, severe and clinically 
significant autoimmune disease has occasionally resulted (Ludewig, Ochsenbein et al. 2000 ). 
 
Despite the fact, that no clinical or radiological evidence of experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced by the DC -based immunization  therapies in any of the 
preclinical experiments or the clinical trials outlined above, it must be acknowledged that one 
potential complication of DC -based immunotherapy, especially once optimized, is the induction 
of clinically significant autoimmunity. I n fact, many published manuscripts have demonstrated the 
induction of clinically significant autoimmunity , including EAE, in preclinical studies employing 
DC-based or other immunization strategies (Borrow, Cornell et al. 1995 ; Dittel, Visintin et al. 1999 ; 
Bourquin, Iglesias et al. 2000 ; Ludewig, Ochsenbein et al. 2000 ). Although this may even be a 
desirable outcome for nonessential tissues, such as the prostate, when infiltrated by tumor, an 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis could be a lethal consequence of any non -specific active 
immunotherapy approach for primary intracere bral tumors where the target antigens are ill -defined 
and not tumor -specific.  
 
In light of the documented expression of normal and fetal brain antigens on human glioma cell 
lines (Wahlstrom, Linder et al. 1973 ), and brain tumor tissue (Siris 1936 ; Slagel, Wilson et al. 1969 ; 
Wickremesinghe and Yates 1971 ), active, specific immunization strategies, including DC -based 
approaches, with uncharacterized brain tumor antigens that are not tumor -specific posses s the 
theoretical risk of inducing an uncontrolled autoimmune response against normal CNS antigens. 
Such a response would be similar to EAE, which is an acute or chronic, autoimmune, inflammatory 
demyelinating disease mediated primarily by antigen -specific CD4+ T-cells.  Myelin basic protein 
is the most common known antigenic trigger, but myelin proteolipid protein (Waksman, Porter et 
al. 1954 ; Wikstrand and Bigner 1979 ), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (Tuohy, Lu et al. 
1988 ), glial fibrillary acidic protein, and S -100(Linington, Berger et al. 1993 ), are also sufficient 
antigens for the induction of EAE.  
 
The susceptibility of humans to the induction of EAE was discovered accidentally when patients 
were immunized against rabies with spinal cords from rabbits that were infected with the rabies 
virus (Pasteur 1885 ; Remlinger 1904 ; Remlinger 1905 ; Stuart and Krikorian 1930 ; Wekerle, 
Kojima et al. 1994 ).  The toxic component found in these immunizations was subsequently proven 
to be related to encephalitogenic components contained within the spinal cord preparation and not 
the virus (Stuart and Krikorian 1928 ). EAE has also been induced in monkeys after repeated 
injections of homogenized CNS tissue (Rivers and Schwentker 1935 ).  It was not until the use of 
strong adjuvants such as complete Freund’s adjuvant  (CFA ), that EAE could be easily and 
reproducibly created in animals in this manner (Kabat, Wolf et al. 1947 ).  Since that time, it has 
been shown that EAE can be readily induced in the various species of rats, guinea pigs, mice, 
sheep, and monkeys after a single injection of CFA and either autologous or heterologous CNS 
tissue homogenate (Bigner, Pitts et al. 1981 ). 
 
Given the range of protocols that routinely use immunization with CNS tissue for the production 
of lethal EAE in non -human primates (Bigner, Pitts et al. 1981 ), and the documented susceptibility 
of humans to EAE, the induction of such autoimmune responses is a legitimate concern.  Some 
apprehension regarding EAE is also warranted on the basis of previous active, specific 
immunotherapy trials in humans with brain  tumors.  Although no cases of EAE were reported in 
some human studies (Ommaya 1976 ; Albright, Seab et al. 1977 ; Mahaley, Bigner et al. 1983 ; 
ATTAC -II   Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy  
Version: 20241007  Page 45 of 121 
CONFIDENTIAL  Bullard, Thomas et al. 1985 ), and protocols have been developed for safe active, specific 
immunotherapy with glioma -derived cells in primates (Wikstrand and Bigner 1981 ), careful review 
of several other studies (Bloom, Peckham et al. 1973 ) and(Trouillas and Lapras 1970 ; Trouillas 
1973 ) reveal one possible case of EAE within each study.  Thus, the risk of EAE, or other similar 
and potentially lethal autoimmune responses, may severely limit the efficacy of active, non-
specific  immunotherapy for malignant brain tumors.  Thus targeting tumor -specific antigens, such 
as the more recently discovered viral antigens associated with CMV  that are present within MGs, 
would enhance the safety of early trials in this field.  
 
6.4 Presence of CMV  in Malignant Astrocytomas  
Human CMV  is an endemic -Herpesvirus that does not usually cause significant clinical 
disease (Vancikova and Dvorak 2001 ).  During primary maternal infection, however, human CMV  
can cause severe encephalitis in fetuses and lead to congenital brain defects.  Human CMV  disease 
is also a significant problem in immunocompromised adults such as organ transplant recipients or 
patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Vancikova and Dvorak 2001 ).  
Herpesviruses have also been implicated in a number of human malignancies including lymphoma, 
nasopharyngeal cancer, cervical cancer, and Kaposi’s sarcoma (Rafferty 1973 ; Kadow, Regueiro -
Ren et al. 2002 ).  Recently, expression of proteins unique to human CMV  has been reported within 
a large proportion of malignant tumors including colorectal carcinoma, prostate cancer, and 
malignant astrocytomas (Cobbs, Harkins et al. 2002 ; Harkins, Volk et al. 2002 ; Samanta, Harkins 
et al. 2003 ). Universal detection of the human CMV  immunodominant protein pp65, immediate 
early gene 1 protein (IE1), and several other early antigens was demonstrated using 
immunohistochemistry (IHC ) in Grade II -IV astrocytomas (Cobbs, Harkins et al. 2002 ).  Presence 
of the virus in these samples was confirmed with in situ  hybridization (ISH), polymerase chain 
reactions (PCR) for human CMV -specific glycoprotein B (UL55), electron microscopic detection 
of intact virions (Cobbs, Harkins et al. 2002 ).  Human CMV  antigens were not detected in 
surrounding normal brain samples, meningiomas, or brains affected by ischemia, Alzheimer’s 
disease, paraneoplastic encephalitis, or Cryptococcal  cerebritis.  
 
The reliable detection of CMV with MGs requires sensitive detection modalities, but these results 
have now been confirmed by nine independent laboratories (Cobbs, Harkins et al. 2002 ; Mitchell, 
Xie et al. 2008 ; Scheurer, Bondy et al. 2008 ; Soderberg -Naucler 2008 ; Dziurzynski, Wei et al. 
2011 ; Lucas, Bao et al. 2011 ; Sampson and Mitchell 2011 ; Soroceanu, Matlaf et al. 2011 ; 
Dziurzynski, Chang et al. 2012 ; Ranganathan, Clark et al. 2012 ). This finding  offers an 
unparalleled opportunity to leverage immunotherapeutic approaches to target the highly 
immunogenic viral antigens expressed by CMV as tumor -specific targets.

A 
biologically plausible explanation for this unexpected specificity was also provided when it was 
subsequently shown that the EGFR is also the cellular receptor for CMV because the EGFR is 
often dramatically up -regulated in MGs, but is essentially not expressed in normal brain (Wang, 
Huong et al. 2003 ).  Interestingly, astrocytic cell lines are some of the few cell lines that support 
CMV propagation in vitro (Poland, Costello et al. 1990 ).  The presence of CMV antigens in 
malignant astrocytomas has been confirmed in independent tissue samples from our laboratory as 
well.  It is not known whether CMV plays a role in the pathogenesis of MG, or whether tumor 
growth simply provides an environm ent supportive of local reactivation of the virus.  Detection of 
CMV  antigen s in MG  specimens has been independently confirmed in our laboratory by IHC, ISH, 
PCR, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR).    
6.5  Immunotherapy of CMV  
The presence of highly -immunogenic human CMV  antigens within MGs affords a unique 
opportunity to target these tumors immunologically.  There is a vast amount of experience with 
both the safety and efficacy of immunotherapy targeting human CMV (Vancikova and Dvorak 
2001 ), and the presence of this virus within brain tumors may allow this experience to be leveraged 
toward the effective eradication of MG expressing human CMV  antigens.  Adoptive T -cell therapy 
has been used to safely and successfully protect against CMV  reactivation in myelodepleted bone 
marrow transplant (BMT ) patients (Riddell and Greenberg 1995 ; Walter, Greenberg et al. 1995 ; 
Paar and Pollard 1996 ; Dazzi and Goldman 1998 ).  In addition, T -cell mediated immunotherapy 
has proven highly effective in the treatment of CMV -associated disease within the CNS (Bigger, 
Tanigawa et al. 1999 ) and in the treatment of acute CMV  infections (Walter, Greenberg et al. 1995 ; 
Numazaki, Ikehata et al. 1997 ).  Tumors associated with other human Herpesviruses , such as 
Epstein -Barr virus -associated lymphoma, including tumors within the CNS, have also been 
effectively treated and even large tumors have been cured by immunotherapy (Emanuel 1991 ; 
Papadopoulos, Ladanyi et al. 1994 ; Emanuel, Lucas et al. 1997 ; Rooney, Smith et al. 1998 ; Lucas 
and Barrett 1999 ; Liu, Savoldo et al. 2002 ).  More recently, a vaccine directed against the potent 
viral antigens of human papilloma virus has also been shown to reduce the incidence of human  
 
Expression of CMV antigens in primary GBM tumors by Western blot analysis. Single cell 
digest were prepared from freshly resected GBM specimens and washed with 2X in PBS to remove 
red cells and debri. Tumor cells were harvested and lysates prepared in the presence of proteinase 
inhibitors and Western blot analysis performed using  IE1-specific MAb (810, Chemicon) and pp65 
MAb (sc 71229, Santa Cruz). CMV - and VSV -infected fibroblast lysates were used as positive and 
negative control samples respectively. Due to abundance of CMV proteins in laboratory strain virus 
infected lysates, 1/40 the amount of lysate was loaded for positive control lanes. Detection of IE1 
has been observed in 14/22 (63.6%) analyzed GBM samples and pp65 detection was positive in 
19/22 (86 .3%) tumors analyzed by WB.  gB envelope protein was detected in 16/16 (100%) tumors 
chosen based on positivity for pp65 (not shown).  Normal brain lysates derived from autopsy 
specimens were negative in 5/5 cases (median age 64) not shown (0%), p<0.0001.

The potential for non -specific targeting of normal tissues is thought to be minimal in seropositive 
patients.  After initial infection, CMV  establishes lifelong latency in the infected individual, with 
cells of the myeloid lineage constituting a major reservoir for persistence of the virus.  Virus can 
be detected within myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow, with a small portion of these cells 
demonstrating viral DNA replication without  any detectable gene expression (Kondo and 
Mocarski 1995 ; Prosch, Docke et al. 1999 ).  Also a small proportion (typically 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 
10,000) of peripheral blood monocytes can be found to contain CMV DNA, while detection of 
viral RNA (gene expression) is not detected (Sissons, Sinclair et al. 1991 ; Larsson, Soderberg -
Naucler et al. 1998 ; Reeves, MacAry et al. 2005 ).   
 
Vaccination specifically against CMV (Gonczol, Ianacone et al. 1989 ; Plotkin, Higgins et al. 1994 ; 
Britt, Fay et al. 1995 ; BenMohamed, Krishnan et al. 2002 ; Pepperl -Klindworth, Frankenberg et al. 
2002 ) has effectively reduced the risk of viral infection and transmission to fetuses in animal 
models (Minamishima 1977 ; Morello, Ye et al. 2002 ; Cicin -Sain, Brune et al. 2003 ) and in clinical 
trials (Sachs, Simmons et al. 1984 ; Gonczol, Ianacone et al. 1989 ; Plotkin, Higgins et al. 1994 ; 
Adler, Shaw et al. 1995 ; Adler, Hempfling et al. 1998 ; Drulak, Malinoski et al. 2000 ). Human 
clinical trials have also demonstrated some benefit of administering neutralizing antibodies in the 
treatment of human CMV  infection (Ohizumi, Suzuki et al. 1994 ; Falagas, Snydman et al. 1997 ; 
Hammond 1999 ; Tzakis 2001 ), highlighting the importance of the development of vaccination 
strategies that elicit both cellular and humoral immune responses.  DCs strongly activate both T -
cell and B -cell responses in vivo (Steinman 2001 ), and DCs pulsed in vitro  with CMV  antigens 
have been shown to be potent inducers of CMV -specific CTL responses in several studies (Cho, 
Han et al. 2001 ; Kleihauer, Grigoleit et al. 2001 ; Szmania, Galloway et al. 2001 ; Peggs, Verfuerth 
et al. 2002 ; Raftery, Schwab et al. 2002 ), in addition to our own work which is outlined below.  
 
6.6 Targeting CMV  in Patients with Malignant Gliomas  
6.6.1 DCs Electroporated with pp65 -LAMP mRNA  
In preparation for the clinical trial outlined in this protocol , we wanted to demonstrate  that DCs 
generated from patients with GBM, when loaded with  CMV  pp65 -LAMP mRNA, could be used 
to generate antigen -specific autologous T -cells.  These in vitro  assays showed that after 15 days of 
co-culture with pp65  RNA -loaded DCs, the number of CD8+/pp65/A2 tetramer+ cells increased 
from <1% at baseline to 42.8% of all lymphocytes  after 15 days while the absolute number of 
positive cells increased from 1.5x105 to 1.17x107 (78-fold expansion).   Further experiments 
demonstrated the ability to exp and CD8+/HLA -A2 tetramer+ T cells from patients with GBM by 
2.51 + 0.83 logs (n=5, range 1.73 -3.74) with a purity of 54.0  + 24.9% (n=5, range 35.9 -88.4).  
 
To establish that T -cells stimulated with pp65 -LAMP mRNA transfected mature DCs reacted in 
an antigen specific manner against CMV  pp65, we assayed for specific IFN - release by ELISPOT.  
DCs that had been previously been transfected with pp65 -LAMP mRNA, matured and frozen,

autologous T -cells.  At the end of 14 days , the effector T -
cells were incubated with target DCs transfected with 
CMV  pp65 -LAMP mRNA, CEA LAMP mRNA, pp65 
peptide mix (138 peptides, 15 mers with 11 amino acid 
overlaps), HIV pol peptide mix , or untransfected DCs at 
different effector to target ratios in nitrocellulose wells 
coated with anti -IFN- MAb.  Effector T -cells generated 
by in vitro  stimulation with CMV  pp65 -LAMP transfected 
DCs secreted IFN - only in response to pp65 transfected 
targets, ( Fig. 4).  Cytokine flow cytometry  (CFC) also 
demonstrated specific response to CMV  pp65 peptide after 
a clinical scale expansion of cells from a patient with 
GBM.  Briefly , cells were incubated for 6 hours with 
mixed overlapping CMV  pp65 peptides (138 peptides, 15 
mers with 11 amino acid overlaps) and brefel din A 
(10ug/ mL) before fixation and permeabilization.   Samples 
were labeled with CD4 (or CD8) -FITC, CD69 -PE, CD3 -
PE/Cy5.5, and IFN --APC (along with appropriate isotype controls).  Flow cytometry  analysis of 
pre and post expansion indicated th at after expansion CD8+/CD69+/CD3+/ IFN -+ increased from 
3.28% to 52.47% while CD4+/CD69+/CD3+/ IFN -+ increased from 0.43% to 78.08%.  It is also 
worth noting that in this particular patient sample there was greater percent of CD8 T -cells 
secreting IFN - (57.84%) than were CMV -pp65 tetramer positive (21.9%).   Finally, to verify that 
these effector cells were capable of killing malignant astrocytes as well, HLA -A-2+ U251MG cells 
were 51Cr-labelled and either pulsed with an HLA -A2 specific pp65 peptide (NLVPMVATV)  
(PEP -CMV ) or the control HIV p17 77-85 
peptide ( SLYNTVATL ) (PEP -HIV) 
(Anaspec), or infected with CMV .  As 
expected, CMV  infection significantly 
reduced MHC class I expression on 
U251MG target cells  with mean 
fluorescent intensity of HLA -A2 staining 
decreasing from 827.5 in uninfected cells 
to 593.9 10 day s after infection.  Still 
effector cells were able to specifically kill 
the malignant astrocytes infected with  
CMV  as well as peptide -pulsed MG targets 
(Fig. 5).  These responses were dependent 
on CD8+ T -cells and HLA -A2.  Another 
CLT assay demonstrated that T -cells 
stimulated by DCs transfected with CMV  
pp65 -LAMP RNA and cultured for 14 days 
show high specific response against  CMV  
pp65 peptide pulsed target cells.  Specific 
killing was demonstrated by utilizing the

6.6.2 Recognition of Human 
CMV  antigens by TILs  
We have recently gathered evidence that recognition of 
human CMV antigens may occur at a significant level in 
patients  with GBM even without vaccination.  PBLs and 
tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were isolated from 
patients and briefly expanded in a non -specific fashion in 
vitro  with CD3/CD28 beads (Dynal) and IL -2. 
Tetramer analysis of an HLA -A.2+ TIL sample revealed a 
frequency of 10.26% pp65/A2 tetramer+ cells  among the 
TILs isolated (Fig. 6).  PBLs from the same patient, 
cultured in an identical fashion, had a starting frequency of 
0.99% pp65/A2 tetramer+ cells, but this number instead 
actually declined during the same culture period to 0.46%.  In an ELISPOT assay, these same 
TILs, when exposed to autologous tumor, HLA -A2 matched irrelevant tumor, or T2 cells loaded 
with HLA -A2 restricted CMV  peptide epitope, also demonstrated CMV -specific secretion of IFN -
 (Fig. 7).  Incidentally, this patient’s tumor stained very strongly for  CMV  antigens in our IHC 
assay.  
 
TIL recognition of pp65 in an HLA -A2-negative patient was also confirmed using cytokine 
florescent cytometry (CFC) after stimulation with CMV  pp65 or HIV p17 peptide mix (BD)  that 
stimulates both CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells.  This patient’s TILs consisted almost entirely of CD8+ 
T-cells and 41.12% of the T -cells became CD69+/IFN -+ after exposure to CMV  pp65 peptide 
mix, indicating a strong reaction to CMV -specific 
peptides (Fig. 8). HIV peptide stimulation did not 
stimulate cytokine production above background 
(0.87%).

6.7 ATTAC and ATTAC -GM Clinical Trial s 
A Phase I/II clinical trial of autologous pp65 RNA loaded DCs was initiated at our center (ATTAC 
Protocol - FDA -IND-BB-12839; Duke IRB Protocol 8108; PI: Duane A. Mitchell).   Twenty -four 
patients with newly -diagnosed GBM who underwent gross total resection (>95%) followed by 
standard external beam radiation (60Gy) and concurrent TMZ (75 mg/m2/day) for 6 weeks 
followed by adjuvant monthly TMZ were enrolled into two cohorts.  Cohort 1 , referred to as the 
ATTAC trial  (n=13 patients)  received standard -dose TMZ (150 -200 mg/m2 x 5 days per cycle) 
and were randomized to receive different inflammatory skin preparation s (unpulsed mature DCs 
or Td booster)  prior to intradermal vaccination with pp65 RNA -loaded DCs.  At the vaccine 4, 
patients received Indium -111 labeled DCs and migration to VDLNs was monitored by SPECT/CT 
imaging.  
Cohort 2 (n=11 patients) , referred to the ATTAC -GM trial,  received dose -intensified TMZ and 
pp65 RNA -pulsed DCs mixed with GM -CSF 
(150ug).  SPECT/CT imaging of DCs was also 
conducted at the fourth vaccine to evaluate the 
impact of GM -CSF on DC migration.  
Leukapheresis harvested post -surgical resection 
and prior to initiation of TMZ was used to generate 
DCs and pp65 RNA electroporated autologous DCs 
(2x107 DCs i.d.) were administered every two 
weeks for first three doses after first TMZ cycle and 
monthly t hereafter on day 2 2-24 of each cycle.  
Patients  in both trials  were monitored by MRI 
(every two months) for tumor progression and 
blood collected monthly for immunologic 
monitoring.  Treatment was well tolerated with no 
vaccine related adverse events on coho rt 1 
(ATTAC) .  A single patient on cohort 2  (ATTAC 
GM)  experience d a Grade 3 hypersensitivity 
reaction that was attributed to GM -CSF.  This 
patient received additional DC vaccines without the 
inclusion of GM -CSF without incident.  
Expansion of CMV -specific T cells was observed 
by tetramer responses in 4 of 13 patients on cohort 
1 after the third vaccine. Subsequent immune  Fig. 9: CFC showing that TILs from an HLA -A2 - patient with GBM recognize CMV .  TILs were

VDLNs (measured at vaccine 4) and clinical outcomes in cohort 1  and patients randomized to

6.8 T Cell Homeostatic Proliferation  
Homeostatic proliferation is a mechanism by which the body maintains normal physiologic levels 
of circulating lymphocytes.  Within the normal host, homeostatic proliferation involves the 
relatively slow replication of naïve and memory T -cells along with th e generation of new 
lymphocytes from the bone marrow to maintain normal numbers of T -cells (and other 
lymphocytes).  
 
Under conditions that induce profound lymphopenia, however, such as during non -myeloablative 
chemotherapy, naïve and memory T -cells enter a rapid proliferative state in order to replenish the 
drastically diminished lymphocyte numbers.  During physiologic h ematopoietic recovery, new T -
cells must be regenerated from the bone marrow or by division of the few remaining T -cells in the 
peripheral lymphoid organs or circulation and is a prolonged process that may take weeks to 
months to recover normal T -cell count s.  Following a period of lymphopenia, there is a 
spontaneous repopulation of the host’s T -cells to re -establish the T -cell repertoire (Cho, Rao et al. 
2000 ). Tanchot et al. (Tanchot, Rosado et al. 1997 ) propose that T -cells remaining after 
lymphodepletion compete for a finite amount of cytokine and antigenic stimulation.  Adoptively 
transferred lymphocytes when transplanted into lymphopenic hosts, also undergo rapid 
proliferation and differentiation into  effector and memory cells and can provide enhanced 
protection against tumor outgrowth in experimental animals (Wrzesinski and Restifo 2005 ).  
Furthermore, populations of tumor -specific lymphocytes when transferred into lymphopenic 
melanoma patients have been shown to be capable of eradicating disseminated malignant disease 
and maintaining high levels of tumor -specific memory T -cells in the ci rculation of treated 
patients (Dudley, Wunderlich et al. 2002 ; Dudley, Wunderlich et al. 2005 ; Hughes, Yu et al. 2005 ; 
Zhou, Dudley et al. 2005 ).  These studies indicate that homeostatic proliferation may be leveraged 
to augment anti -tumor immunity by using T -cells educated to be reactive against tumor either 
through ex vivo  expansion or possibly DC vaccination in vivo . 
 
Recently it has also been demonstrated that depletion of the host’s native lymphocyte pool with 
subsequent vaccination during endogenous homeostatic T -cell reconstitution enhanced the 
protection of mice bearing established extracranial tumors (Asavaroengchai, Kotera et al. 2002 ).  
Similarly, adoptive reconstitution with tumor -reactive T -cells after intentional non -myeloablative 
lymphodepletion allowed for a marked preferential expansion and maintenance of tumor -specific 
transferred T -cells resulting in dramatic clinical responses , along with some autoimmune toxicity, 
in patients with advanced malignant melanoma (Dudley, Wunderlich et al. 2002 ).  Later studies 
have also indicated that ex vivo  manipulation of the adoptively transferred cells, for example by 
ATTAC -II   Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy  
Version: 20241007  Page 52 of 121 
CONFIDENTIAL  depletion of T regs, further enhances the reconstitution of the host with tumor antigen -specific T -
cells(Antony, Piccirillo et al. 2005 ).  These approaches take advantage of still undefined 
homeostatic forces that provide an environment conducive to T -cell proliferation during recovery 
from lymphopenia.  We propose to use  tetanus prior to  DC vaccination in patients with treatment -
induced lymphopenia in order to determine whether this addition increases total uptake at 48 hours  
compared to those patients that received PBMCs with or without tetanus . 
 
Our previous studies have demonstrated  the safety of DC vaccination targeting the EGFRvIII 
mutation in patients with MGs, and we expect the targeting of CMV  antigens to be well tolerated.  
There is considerable clinical experience with T -cell based immunotherapy targeting CMV  in bone 
marrow and organ transplant patients and these studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy 
of immunotherapy against CMV , even in CNS -involved disease.  Lymphopenia will be induced in 
our patient population using standard  doses of TMZ , an alkylating agent used routinely in the 
treatment of MGs at our institution and abroad as outlined below.  We, therefore, expect that DC  
+ GM -CSF pretreated with or without Td should be safe and highly efficacious in patients with 
MGs.  
 
Lymphodepletion may be advantageous in patients with GBMs for several reasons.  First, 
lymphodepletion will eliminate the defective T -cells that are well -described in patients with 
GBM (Brooks, Netsky et al. 1972 ).  Second, lymphodepletion will eliminate T regs, an inhibitory 
subset shown by us to be significantly upregulated in patients with GBMs (Fig. 11) and, in fact 
TMZ  may preferentially deplete these suppressive cells (Su, Sohn et al. 2004 ).  By transferring 
tumor -specific T -cells into such an environment, especially in the context of tumor -specific 
vaccination, the tumor -specific T -cells may have a selective advantage.  It has also been shown in 
lymphopenic hosts, that proliferating T -cells differentiate directly into memory T -cells capable of 
rapid and intense response to antigen re -
exposure (Tanchot, Rosado et al. 1997 ).  Grossman 
and Paul propose that T -cells respond to 
lymphopenia by tuning their activation threshold 
down to a level at which T -cells are driven to 
proliferate, even in the absence of foreign 
antigens (Grossman and Paul 2000 ).  Also in line 
with our thinking,  others (Dudley, Wunderlich et 
al. 2002 ; Hu, Poehlein et al. 2002 ) propose that, if 
tumor antigens are present during this 
repopulation, the population of T -cell could be 
skewed to create a tumor antigen -targeted 
response.  Homeostatic proliferation can then be 
augmented with autologous transfer of antigen -
specific activated T -cells to skew the reconstituted

cell repertoire that preferentially targets tumor

that transferred T -cells can expand dramatically in 
the host to the point where they constitute up to

6.9 Treatment -Induced Lymphopenia from TMZ  
TMZ , a methylating agent with good blood -brain barrier penetration , has recently been shown to 
increase survival by a small, but statistically significant, 2.5 months in a subset of patients with 
newly -diagnosed GBM if given in conjunction with RT following initial resection of the 
tumor (Stupp, Dietrich et al. 2002 ; Hegi, Diserens et al. 2005 ; Stupp, Mason et al. 2005 ).  
Leukopenia is essentially the only known human toxicity of TMZ .  Although initially counter -
intuitive, this TMZ -induced leukopenia may actually be advantageous in treating patients with 
immunotherapy due to the subsequent homeostatic proliferation it induces.  In this protocol 
patients will receive standard of care doses of TMZ  concurrent with RT following initial resection 
of the tumor.  We believe that the myelosuppression induced by therapeutic TMZ  treatment, if 
carefully timed before  vaccination or adop tive reconstitution with CMV -specific T -cells, will 
actually enhance the proliferation and maintenance of these tumor -specific T -cells through the 
natural forces that drive T -cell homeostatic proliferative recovery.  In addition, TMZ  has also been 
shown to preferentially deplete T regs(Su, Sohn et al. 2004 ).  Thus, this combination strategy will 
uniquely exploit the toxicity of one effective therapy for GBMs, TMZ , to enhance another already 
promising therapy, immunotherapy.   In preparation for this protocol, we have evaluated , in animal 
models, TMZ  and sublethal whole body irradiation (WBI), as a positive control, as methods for 
induction of treatment -induced lymphopenia in order to determine the ability of TMZ -induced 
lymphodepletion to enhance active and adoptive immunotherapy.  These studies were initially 
performed in a murine T -cell receptor transgenic model in which the antigen -specific T -cells can 
be foll owed in vivo  in mice receiving adoptive transfer.  In this model system, we found that ALT 
coupled with DC vaccination (DC  + ALT) is a potent mechanism for inducing antigen -specific T -
cell expansion after TMZ  treatment.  TMZ  was found to be an effective agent for inducing 
homeostatic proliferation of transferred CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells and for enhancing DC  or peptide 
vaccinations with or without ALT  (Fig. 12) .

 STUDY RATIONALE  
 
We have demonstrated in murine models that DCs loaded with tumor -specific antigens in the form 
of peptides or RNA can induce potent and specific humoral and cell -mediated immune responses 
that are effective against murine intracerebral ( i.c.) tumors, including a syngeneic murine 
astrocytoma, without inducing autoimmunity (Heimberger, Crotty et al. 2000 ; Heimberger, Archer 
et al. 2002 ; Heimberger 2003 ; Mitchell, Cui et al. 2011 ).  Our previous clinical experience has also 
shown that DC vaccines in combination with standard of care radiation therapy and chemotherapy 
are capable of generating potent, tumor -specific immune responses and clinical radiographic 
responses in patients with MGs.  We and others have also shown that antigens derived from CMV 
are contained within MGs and may serve as potent and specific immunotherap y targets.  
Vaccination and adoptive T -cell strategies targeting CMV in humans in other contexts, including 
the targeting of lesions within the CNS, have been safe and effective.  We have also shown that 
DCs generated from patients with GBM and loaded with pp65 -LAMP mRNA are capable of 
generating CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells that produce IFN - and kill malignant astrocytes infected with 
CMV in an antigen -specific fashion.  We have found that TILs isolated from these patients are 
significantly enriched for T -cells that specifically recognize CMV antigens, suggesting that this  
 
Fig. 1 2: Homeostatic lymphodepletion induced by temozolomide enhances antigen -specific immune responses.   
Untreated mice or mice receiving non -myeloablative high -dose temozolomide treatment (5 days x 60 mg/kg) were 
administered a mixture of OVA -specific and normal lymphocytes intravenously and received either no vaccine, 
vaccination with DCs transfected with  OVA RNA, or OVA peptide vaccination in complete Freund’s adjuvant.  The 
peripheral blood of treated animals was collected and analyzed 6 days after vaccination for the expansion of OVA -
specific T -cells in the circulation using αCD8 monoclonal antibodies a nd a specific tetramer.  As shown above, mice 
treated with temozolomide prior to ALT demonstrated markedly increased T -cell expansion after vaccination 
compared to untreated hosts receiving ALT.

CONFIDENTIAL  response may be important in the biology of these tumors . We have recently demonstrated that 
fusion of the immunodominant antigen CMVpp65 to full -length LAMP targeting protein enhances 
activation and expansion of CMV -specific T cells in vitro .  TMZ  has recently shown efficacy in 
some patients with newly -diagnosed GBM and is now frequently given to these patients during 
initial RT.  Therapeutic TMZ  induces a profound lymphopenia , however, that may inhibit anti -
tumor vaccination.  With these observations in m ind, we are now proposing to determine the 
immunologic and clinical effects of CMV -specific vaccination after therapeutic TMZ -induced 
lymphodepletion with GM-CSF and with  Td skin preparations  in patients with newly -diagnosed 
GBM . 
 
Td is a routinely used vaccine in the normal human population that we have shown in pilot studies 
may function as a potent adjuvant to enhance DC trafficking to VDLNs. Our previous studies have 
shown that successful DC migration to VDLNs may be a requisite  for clinical activity of RNA -
pulsed DCs and administration of Td prior to vaccination may improve the effectiveness of DC 
vaccines in patients with GBM.  
 
Adjuvants frequently used with vaccination include Freund’s incomplete adjuvant, bacilli 
Calmette -Guerin, QS -21, and diphtheria toxoid.  Supplemental cytokines have been used as well 
for the adjuvant immunological effects (Rosenberg, Yang et al. 1998 ). GM -CSF has been 
commonly used, as it is commercially available and well tolerated.  GM -CSF is capable of 
stimulating macrophage function, inducing proliferation and maturation of dendritic cells, and is 
able to enhance T -lymphocyte stimulatory function.  Intradermal administration of GM -CSF 
enhances the immunization efficacy at the site of administration in a dose  dependent fashion at an 
optimal dose of 125 g(Kremer, Stevens et al. 2000 ).  Significant anti -tumor immunity has been 
demonstrated in preclinical murine studies in which irradiated, stably transfected tumor cell lines 
secreting GM -CSF have protected against subsequent tumor challenge, especially against 
intracerebral tumors (Sampson, Ashley et al. 1997 ; Mach, Gillessen et al. 2000 ).  Furthermore, the 
potency of GM -CSF has been demonstrated in a Phase I clinical trial in melanoma patients 
vaccinated with irradiated autologous melanoma cells engineered to secrete GM -CSF(Soiffer, 
Lynch et al. 1998 ).  The immunization sites were intensely infiltrated with T lymphocytes, 
dendritic cells, macrophages, and eosinophils in 100% of evaluable patients.  Extensive tumor 
destruction was seen in 11 of 16 patients.  Both cytotoxic T cells and antibody responses  were 
associated with this tumor destruction. Hence, GM -CSF has an extensive track record both as a 
growth factor and an adjuvant, is commercially available and has an acceptable toxicity profile. 
The experience on the ACTIVATE study supports the use of GM -CSF and sets the precedent for 
this study.

 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
9.1 Overview  
The eligibility criteria for this trial will be similar to those used in the RTOG 0525 study (Aldape 
2009 ).  Prior to the initiation of TMZ and external beam RT, patients will sign consent and undergo 
leukapheresis for PBMCs in accordance with SOP -UFBTIP -131.  
Up to 200 newly diagnosed  WHO Grade IV glioma  patients will be enrolled in the study. Eligible 
patients will be randomized, undergo leukapheresis and receive “standard -of-care” radiotherapy 
concurrent with TMZ under the assumption that approximately 120 patients will be vaccinated 
according to treatm ent arm  in this placebo controlled, single blinded, randomized Phase II study.  
 
Prior to leukapheresis, patients will be randomized to receive one of three treatment regimens with 
dose-intensified TMZ treatment at 100 mg/m2/day for 21 days with an allocation ratio of 1:1:1 into 
one of three arms to receive:  
 
1)  pp65 -shLAMP mRNA DCs with GM -CSF 150 µg (Td skin prep)  
2)  pp65 -flLAMP mRNA DCs with GM -CSF 150 µg (Td skin prep)  
3)  Unpulsed PBMCs (saline skin prep)  
 
Randomization will be stratified by ; 
- Age 69 years old and younger, who will receive dose -intensified adjuvant temozolomide; 
or 70 years old and older who will receive standard dose adjuvant temozolomide.   
- Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) class (III, IV, or V).  
To determine RPA class, Performance Status (PS)  will be determined from KPS conversion 
using the ECOG comparison scale  for patients ≤  50 years ; a Mini -Mental State 
Examination will be performed at enrollment for patient s ≥ 50 years .  
- CMV seronegative or seropositive

CONFIDENTIAL  Within 7 weeks of surgery, p atients will undergo standard RT with concurrent TMZ at a target 
dose of 75 mg/m2/day.   
 
Patients will receive the initial cycle of TMZ 4 (+/ - 1) weeks after completing RT. Study drugs 
will be given intradermally at day 22 -24 after the first TMZ cycle and divided equally between 
both inguinal regions  in accordance with SOP -UFBTIP -128. All patients will receive Td booster 
(5 Lf) with vaccine #1 regardless of booster history.  Vaccine #2 and #3 will occur at 2 week 
intervals.  
 
All patients will undergo repeat leukapheresis 2 to 4 weeks after vaccine #3  for PBMCs to generate 
additional DC vaccines and for immunologic monitoring with specific assessment of baseline 
antigen -specific cellular and humoral immune responses.  TMZ cycle 2 will occur 24 hours to 1 
week after repeat leukapheresis.  Patients may undergo additional leukapheresis , if needed , to 
generate up to 10 DC vaccines  as outlined in section 9.6. , Removal of PBMCs by Leuka pheresis . 
 
Patients will then be vaccinated monthly in conjunction with subsequent TMZ cycles every 5(+/ - 
1) weeks for a total of 6 to 12 cycles after RT as per guidelines defined in recent phase III clinical 
trial evaluating TMZ regimens in patients with GBM (RTOG 0 525).  Vaccines will be given on 
day 22 -24 of each TMZ cycle.  Patients will continue with monthly vaccinations until a total of 10 
vaccines have been administered or until tumor progression (whichever comes first).   
 
All patients will undergo vaccine site pretreatment with Td (1 Lf) or saline (depending on 
randomization arm) 6 -24 hours prior to Vaccine #3, #6, and #9.  At vaccine #3, patients at the UF 
site will undergo MRI/MRS  imaging of inguinal vaccine -site draining lymph nodes before vaccine 
site pretreatment, 48  hrs post vaccination, and 5 to 7 days post vaccination (optional) . Peripheral 
blood and urine samples will be collected at these time points for soluble biomarker analysis.  
 
Patients who have been enrolled in the study and become ineligible to receive study treatment for 
reasons other than progression may be allowed to receive vaccines that have been generated for 
them at the discretion of the PI as outlined in section 9.8 DC or PBMC Vaccination.   
 
Blood for immune monitoring will be collected during initial leukapheresis, prior to vaccines 1 -3, 
during MRI/MRS  imaging time points surrounding vaccine #3, during the second leukapheresis, 
prior to vaccine 4, 7, 10, and at progression  if feasible .  Peripheral blood will be processed in 
accordance with SOP -UFBTIP -126.   Urine samples will be collected at MRI/MRS  imaging time 
points surrounding vaccine #3 and transferred to the UFBTIP laboratory for  nMR  analysis.  
 
Up to twelve cycles of TMZ may be given if the patient demonstrates continued improvement or 
stability on radiologic scan, decreased corticosteroid requirement, improvement in performance 
status, or improvement in neurologic function.  
 
Patients will be imaged bimonthly during TMZ cycles and every 3  months after the 12th TMZ 
cycle (or 1 year post surgery if TMZ discontinued prior to 12 cycles) without receiving any other 
prescribed antitumor therapy unless progression occurs.

CONFIDENTIAL  The primary measure of response will be by serial measures of the product of the two largest 
cross -sectional diameters.  The modified RANO criteria (Ellingson, Wen, Cloughesy  2017) will 
be used for assessment of pseudoprogression , progression or response .  
 
Tumor progression should be documented histologically, unless there are clinical 
contraindications, to exclude inflammatory responses presenting as radiographic or clinical 
changes, which could indicate potentially toxic or therapeutic responses and not tumor 
progression. As this is not a research procedure, consent for biopsy will be obtained separately. If 
tissue is obtained, it will be used to confirm tumor progression histologically and evaluate cellular 
infiltration and CMV antigen expression at the tu mor site.  
If histopathology confirms treatment effect vs tumor progression , the patient may resume study 
treatment at the discretion of the PI in consultation with the treating physician, if  the PI  believes 
that it is safe to continue therapy and that  the patient may benefit from the ongoing treatment 
regimen  as described in section 11.11 Confirmation of Tumor Progression by Histopathology.  
 
Patients will be followed until death due to any cause. MRI and clinical evaluation for assessment 
of disease progression will be conducted bi -monthly for the first 12 months and then every 3 
months thereafter.  
 
9.2 Registration Procedures  
To register a patient to this  study, patient demographic data will be entered into the UFHCC 
OnCore database by the participating site coo rdinator after subject consent ha s been  obtained and 
documented .  The Oncore database will assign a study ID to the patient after eligibility is 
confirmed and a n “On Study ” Date is entered in Oncore.  Patients who signed consent but are  
deemed not eligible to participate , will be assigned a failed -screening ID by the Coordinating 
Center Project Coordinator.   
 
For patient s enrolled at an outside participating site who will receive study treatment at the 
University of Florida, the ATTAC Registration Form will be submitted to the Protocol 
Coordinating Center along with  applicable supporting documentation.   Once the patient has been 
entered in the UFHCC database and the registrat ion form has been  received, the Protocol 
Coordinating Center will confirm  eligibility and randomize eligible  patient s. The patient’s 
assigned study ID will be forward ed to the participating site coordinator by email.  
 
9.3   Randomization Procedures  
Patient s will be randomized  by the designated  site personnel where study treatment will be 
administered  in accordance with SOP -UFBTIP -140.01. 
 
9.4 Radiation Therapy  
Standard external beam RT will be administered concomitant ly with TMZ (Appendix A) 
according to standard guidelines  which were adopted from the RTOG 0525 protocol  and per the 
recommendation of the treating Radiation Oncologist .  Institutional practices for administration of 
external beam RT for patients with GBM may be followed.  
 
Patients enrolled in the study will  be encouraged to receive Radiation Therapy (and concomitant 
chemotherapy) at their participating  study  site. However, to limit travel  and finance -related  burden

standard chemo -radiation with their local treating oncologist .  
 
9.5 Temozol omide Therapy  
TMZ will be administered concomitant ly with standard external beam RT .  
 
Management of chemotherapy will be done by the  patient ’s treating neuro -oncologist in 
accordance with institutional practice s. 
 
Post RT, patients will receive Adjuvant cycles of  doses -intensified TMZ . Dose intensified TMZ  
will be administered orally once per day for 21 consecutive days (days 1 -21) of a 35 (+/ - 7) days 
cycle at 100 mg/m2/day.  Cycle #1 will last up to  12 weeks to allow time to administer 3 bi -weekly 
vaccine s and repeat leukapheresis .  Based on TMZ -associated  adverse event s during the previous 
cycles, d ose reduction of dose-intense  TMZ may be done at the discretion of the  site treating neuro -
oncologist .  Patients who experienced significant hematologic toxicity will not receive dose -
intense temozolomide.  Patients who experienced hematologic toxicity grade ≥ 3 due to 
Temozolomide during their chemo -radiation treatment will r eceive standard dose Temozolomide 
at 150 -200 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive day s of a 35 (+/7) days cycle. For these patients , one dose 
reduction to 100 mg/m2/day for 5 days will be allowed based on AE on previous cycle.  
 
Appendix B, C and D are  provided as guideline s for dose modifications  and chemo management .  
 
Patients age 70 and above, will receive standard dose Temozolomide at 150 -200 mg/m2/day for 5 
consecutive day s of a 35 (+/7) days cycle.  For these subjects,  one dose reduction to 100 mg/m2/day 
for 5 days will be allowed based on AE on previous cycle.  
 
In the event that  chemo adjuvant cycle is delayed past the timeframe provided in Appendix C and 
D, the treatment with Temozolomide may resume when toxicity has resolved (or returned within 
treatment limits) if patient has not experienced tumor progression at the discretion of the  PI in 
consultation with the treating physician, if  the PI  believes that it is safe to continue therapy and 
that the patient may benefit from  additional chemo cycles. Study vaccines will be given at day 22 -
24 of each cycle when chemo is restart ed. 
 
9.6 Removal of PBMCs by Leukapheresis  
Prior to the initiation of TMZ and external beam RT and again 2 to 4 weeks after vaccine #3, 
subjects will undergo leukapheresis in accordance with SOP -UFBTIP -131. Intravenous access 
will be obtained by placing two large gauge catheters into the antecubital veins bilaterally or by 
using a dialysis -type central venous catheter that will allow for large volume apheresis. In addition 
to research protocol consent, additional surgical/procedural consent will be obtained for placement 
of the central venous cathet er by the surgeon/proceduralist. Placement of this special catheter may 
require use of fluoroscopy. The procedure will be conducted using the COBE®Spectra ™ Apheresis 
System (or equivalent).  A sample of each leukapheresis product will be used for immunologic 
monitoring.  
 
Subjects may und ergo additional leukapheresis , if needed , to generate up to 10 DC vaccines.  
Additional leukapheresis procedures may be performed at anytime at the discretion of the PI to

should be scheduled no earlier than 1 week following DC vaccination and prior to the following 
TMZ cycle.  After the leuk apheresis, TMZ cycle may occur as scheduled.   
 
9.6.1 PBMC Generation , Storage , and Testing  
PBMC s will be extracted  from leukapheresis by density centrifugation  in the UF cGMP facility .  
The cells are washed and processed according to BR-UFBTIP -1001  and BR -UFBTIP -1001 -C 
for PBMC to be used as a clinical product . The PBMCs are then stored until needed in liquid 
nitrogen. After freezing and prior to release  of PBMC as a clinical product , an aliquot of 
cryopreserved cells  will be thawed and sent for QA/QC release testing according to SOP -
UFBTIP -122. Testing will include sterility, aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures, fungal 
cultures,  mycoplasma  and endotoxin testing.

Dendritic Cells will be manufactured according to BR-UFBTIP -1002  or BR -UFBTIP -1002 -C 
from either fresh or frozen PBMC . Immature DCs will be generated from adherent cells of the 
PBMCs under the culture condition that contains GM -CSF and IL -4 for 7 days.   At the end of the 
7 day incubation, the cells are then harvested and electroporated with pp65 -shLAMP mRNA or 
pp65 -flLAMP mRNA per randomization assignment. The DCs are placed in a flask with A IM V 
media containing  HABS + GM-CSF + IL-4+ TNF -α + IL -6 + IL -1β and incubated at 37OC in 5% 
CO 2 for 18 -24 hours for maturation.   The antigen loaded mature DCs are harvested , washed , and 
then stored until needed in a liquid nitrogen freezer.   After freezing and prior to release, an aliquot 
of cells will be thawed and sent for QA/QC release testing according to SOP -UFBTIP -
122. Testing will include sterility, aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures, fungal cultures, and 
endotoxin testing.   Production of PBMC product will be in accordan ce with BR -UFBTIP -1001 -
C. 
 
9.6.3 Preparation of DCs or PBMCs for Vaccination  
For each vaccination, DCs or PBMCs will be rapidly thawed at 37oC, washed with PBS and 
counted. The cell concentration will be adjusted to 2x107 cells per 400µL of preservative free 
saline containing 150 µg of GM -CSF for DC vaccines and saline only for PBMC vaccines  and 
loaded into a 1 mL tuberculin syringe with a n appropriately sized needle  in accordance with SOP -
UFBTIP -1124 . 
 
9.7 Tetanus and Diphtheria Toxoid Booster  and site pre-
treatment  
At time of first vaccination , all patients , regardless of  tetanus vaccination history , will receive  a 
Td booster (5 Lf) intramuscularly into the deltoid  muscle .   
 
Subjects  will undergo  vaccine  site pretreatment  with a  one-fifth dose of Td (1 Lf) (treatment arms 
1 and 2) or saline (arm  3) intradermally 6 -24 hours prior  to Vaccine  #3, #6, and #9, alternating site 
for each pretreatment

CONFIDENTIAL  9.8 DC or PBMC Vaccination  
On day 22-24 of the first TMZ  cycle, all patient groups will receive their first intradermal 
immunization  in accordance with SOP -UFBTIP -128 (per randomization assignment).  The 2  
subsequent  immunizations will be given every 2 (+/- 1) weeks for a total of three doses .  Each 
immunization will be divided equally between  both inguinal regions  with a total volume of 200 
µL per side .  Vaccines target dose is 2 x 10 ^7 cells. If less cells (DCs or PBMCs) are available at 
time of vaccination, injection may proceed with available cells and patients will be informed of 
the lower dose.   Patients will be monitored for thirty minutes to one hour post -immunization for 
the development of any adverse effects.  The immunization procedures will be supervised by a 
nurse or physician tha t has completed an Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) course.  A 
cardiac resuscitation cart will be available in the immediate vicinity when performing these 
immunizations in case of severe allergic reactions.   
 
After vaccine  #3, patients will undergo a  repeat leukapheresis for PBMCs and immunologic 
monitoring .  
 
Subsequently, patients will be immunized on day 22-24 of every cycle of TMZ . 
 
Monthly vaccinations will continue until a total of 10 vaccines have been administered or until 
tumor progression  (whichever comes first) .  Missed vaccines during cycles 1 -8 may be given with 
subsequent cycles of Temozolomide (or monthly for patients off Temozolomide) if there is no 
tumor progression until patients receive a total of 10 vaccines.   
 
Patients who experience d toxicity during temozolomide adjuvant cycles for whom it is deemed 
not safe to  resume chemo cycles may continue to receive monthly study vaccines at the discretion 
of the  PI in consultation with the treating physician, if  the PI  believes that it is safe to continue 
therapy and that patients may benefit from the study treatment. Vaccination with investigational 
product may be given  until the patient  receive s a total of 10 vaccines or until progression , 
whichever comes first .   
 
Patients who can no longer receive Temozolomide and start  other  anti -cancer therap ies before  
experiencing  disease progression will not receive additional study vaccines.  
 
Patients who have been enrolled in the study but are no longer eligible to receive study treatment  
for reasons other than progression are allowed to receive vaccines that have been generated for 
them at the discretion of the PI. They will be replaced for purposes of study endpoint if they do 
not meet criteria of an evaluable subject (received standard XRT/TMZ and received at least one 
DC vaccine).  Such subjects would include: subjects who do not complete standard radiation 
treatment with concomitant TMZ, h ave prolonged interruption of treatment beyond allowable 
study guidelines. These patients will be included in the intent to treat analysis but excluded from 
the evaluable subjects analysis if disqualified prior to receiving first vaccine. Such subjects may  
receive QA/QC qualified DC vaccines according to study schedule with or without TMZ at 
discretion of the PI and in consultation with the treating neuro -oncologist   (i.e. subjects removed 
for intolerance of TMZ treatment may discontinue or reduce TMZ dose as clinical management 
would dictate).

CONFIDENTIAL  Given absence of curative treatment for GBM, release of vaccines to patient s who have consented 
to the study but are unable to meet study requirements (most often chemotherapy intolerance) is 
deemed in best interest of the enrolled subjects and best utilization of cGMP manufactured 
autologous products. While these patients may be excluded from primary endpoint analysis of 
evaluable subjects, all toxicity monitoring and DLT stopping rules will apply to any subjects 
receiving DC vaccinat ion. 
 
9.9 MRI/MRS Imaging of DC Migration  
All p atients  will undergo vaccine site pre -treatment with Td (1Lf ) (Martin -Fontecha, Sebastiani et 
al. 2003 ) or saline 6-24 hours prior to Vaccine #3, #6, and #9 . 
 
At vaccine # 3, patients at the University of Florida site will undergo MRI/MRS  imaging  before 
vaccine site pretreatment, 48hrs post vaccination , and 5 to 7 days post vaccination  (optional)  to 
evaluate impact of DC vaccination and unpulsed PBMC vaccination at inguinal draining lymph 
nodes.  MRI/MRS imaging 5 to 7 days post vaccination may be performed when feasible for 
patients. Regions of interest will be analyzed in a blinded fashion by qualified radiologists within 
the Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy (AMRIS) facility  and UF Health 
Department of Radiology .  Peripheral blood and urine will be collected at these time points for 
soluble  biomarker analysis. These correlative studies are designed to determine whether changes 
in VDLNs can be assessed by MR I/MRS  and correlation between changes  and clinical outcome.

 RESPONSE EVALUATION  
 
The modified RANO provides clinical guidelines for continuing therapy  beyond  suspected 
radiographic progression if the treating physician believes there may be a therapeutic benefit and 
provide s criteria for defining progression and early drug failure while also allowing for the 
possibility of pseudoprogression ( PsP) and pseudoresponse ( PsR). An update to the  RANO 
criteria proposes  strategies to establish a general framework for response assessment in neuro -
oncology that is agnostic to the mechanism of action of the particular therapy (anti -angiogenic, 
immunotherapy ...) to address the challenges associated with interpretation of radiographic 
changes in patients with glioblastoma in clinical trials.  The modified RANO proposes to use the 
post-radiation time point as the baseline  for response evaluation and to consider only 
objectively defined, measurable enhancing disease in the definition of response and progression 
(i.e. exclusion of qualitative assessed T2/FLAIR changes)  
 
11.1 General Methodology for Determining Tumor Measurements  
Newly diagnosed GBM patients will initially undergo a pre -entry MRI scan for initial diagnosis 
prior to entry in the study and prior to therapy. The post -operative scan will determine  residual 
enhancing disease which may be used as a covariate in survival analyses . Patients will then start 
on standard therapy , Temozolomide  with concurrent radiation therapy (RT). The Post-RT 
scan  will be required and used as the baseline scan  for which response will be determined.  
Following the first cycles of adjuvant thera py, patients will receive additional  required MRI 
scans.  
 
All radiographic responses will be based on MRI scans of the brain obtained with and without 
contrast. Tumor size will be based on the product of the maximal diameters in 2 different  planes. 
Response will be assessed as a percentage change in tumor size from baseline. Tumor 
measurements in the follow -up scans will be compared to those of the post-RT scan to document 
response.  
 
Definition of Measurable Disease, Non -Measurable Disease, and Target Lesions  
Measurable disease should be defined as contrast enhancing lesions with a minimum size of  both  
perpendicular measurements greater than or equal to 10mm (if the largest diameter is greater than 
10mm but the perpendicular diameter is less than 10mm, this would constitute  non-measurable 
disease ).  Up to a total of five target measurable lesions should be defined and ranked from largest 
to smallest . 
 
Algorithm for identifying measurable and target lesions :

CONFIDENTIAL   
 
11.2 Complete Response  (CR)  
Requires all of the following:  
1. Disappearance of all enhancing measurable and non -measurable disease sustained for at 
least 4 weeks. The first scan exhibiting disappearance of all enhancing measurable and 
non-measurable disease is considered “preliminary CR”. If the second scan exhibits 
measurable enhancing disease with respect to the “preliminary CR” scan, then the 
response is not sustained, noted as pseudoresponse, PsR, and is now considered 
“preliminary PD” (note : confirmed PD requires at least two sequ ential increases in tumor 
volume ). If the second scan continues to exhibit disappearance of enhancing disease or 
emergence of non -measurable disease (less than 10mm bidimensional product), it is 
considered a durable CR  and the patient should continue on therapy until confirmed PD 
is observed.  
2. Patients must be off corticosteroids (or on physiologic replacement doses only).  
3. Stable or impr oved clinical assessments.  
Note: Patients with non -measurable disease only at baseline cannot have CR; the best response 
possible is stable disease (SD).

CONFIDENTIAL  11.3 Partial Response  (PR)  
 Requires  all of the following:  
1. ≥50% decrease in sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable 
enhancing lesions compared with baseline, sustained for at least 4 weeks. The first scan 
exhibiting ≥50% decrease in sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all 
measurable enhancing lesions compared with baseline is considered “preliminary PR”. If 
the second scan exhibits PD with respect to the “preliminary PR” scan, then the respon se 
is not sustained, noted as pseudoresponse, PsR, and is now considered “preliminary PD” 
(note confirmed PD requires at least two sequential increases in tumor volume). If the 
second scan exhibits SD, PR, or CR, it is considered a  durable PR  and the patient should 
continue on therapy until confirmed PD is observed.  
2. Steroid dose should be the same or lower compared with baseline scan.  
3. Stable or improved clinical assessments.  
Note: Patients with non -measurable disease only at baseline cannot have PR; the best response possible is stable 
disease (SD).  
 
11.4 Stable Disease  (SD)  
 Requires  all of the following:  
1. Does not qualify for complete response , partial response , or progressive disease . Note 
this also applies to patients that demonstrate PsR when the confirmation scan does not 
show PD or PsP when the confirmation scan does not show PR/CR.  
In the event that corticosteroid dose was increased (for new symptoms/signs) without confirmation 
of disease progression on neuroimaging, and subsequent follow -up imaging shows that the steroid 
increase was required because of disease progression, the last  scan considered to show stable 
disease will be the scan obtained when the corticosteroid dose was equivalent to the baseline dose.  
 
11.5 Progressive Disease  
 Defined by any of the following:  
1. At least two sequential scans separated by at ≥4 weeks both exhibiting ≥25% increase in 
sum of products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions. The first scan 
exhibiting ≥25% increase in sum of products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing 
lesions should be compared to the smallest tumor measurement obtained either at 
baseline (if no decrease) or best response (on stable or increasing steroid dose) and is 
noted as “preliminary PD.” If the second scan at least 4 weeks later exhibits  a subsequent 
≥25% increase in sum of products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions 
relative to the “preliminary PD” scan, it is considered “confirmed PD” and the patient 
should discontinue therapy. If the second scan at least 4 weeks later exhi bits SD or 
PR/CR, this scan showing “preliminary PD” is noted as “pseudoprogression”, PsP, and 
the patient should continue on therapy until a second increase in tumor size relative to the 
PsP scan is observed. Note that any new  measurable  (>10mm x 10mm) enhancing 
lesions should  not be immediately considered PD, but instead should be added to the sum 
ATTAC -II   Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy  
Version: 20241007  Page 73 of 121 
CONFIDENTIAL  of bidimensional products or total volume representing the entire enhancing tumor 
burden.  
2. In the case where the baseline or best response demonstrates no measurable enhancing 
disease (visible or not visible), then any new  measurable  (>10mm x 10mm) enhancing 
lesions are considered PD  after  confirmed by a subsequent scan ≥4 weeks exhibiting 
≥25% increase in sum of products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions 
relative to the scan first illustrating new measurable disease. The first scan exhibiting new 
measurable disease is noted as “preliminary PD.” If the second scan at least 4 weeks later 
exhibits a subsequent ≥25% increase in sum of product s of perpendicular diameters of 
enhancing lesions relative to the “preliminary PD” scan it is considered “confirmed PD” 
and the patient should discontinue therapy. If the second scan at least 4 weeks later 
exhibits SD, CR, PR, or becomes non -measurable, th is scan showing “preliminary PD” is 
noted as “pseudoprogression”, PsP, and the patient should continue on therapy until a 
second increase in tumor size relative to the “preliminary PD”, or PsP, scan is observed. 
Note that any new  measurable (>10mm x 10mm) enhancing lesions on the subsequent 
scan following the preliminary PD scan should  not be immediately considered confirmed 
PD, but instead should be added to the sum of bidimensional products or total volume 
representing the entire enhancing tumor burden.  
3. Clear clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from tumor (e.g. 
seizures, medication adverse effects, therapy complications, stroke, infection) or 
attributable to changes in steroid dose.  
4. Failure to return for evaluation as a result of death or deteriorating condition.  
11.6 Symptomatic Deterioration & Reporting Clinical Status  
Patients with global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time, and not either related to study treatment or 
other medical conditions, should be reported as PD due t o “symptomatic deterioration.” Every 
effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of 
treatment due to symptomatic deterioration.  
Neurological exam data should be provided to the study designated neuro -radiologists as “stable, 
improved, declined” in case report forms. Clinical status should be recorded as “declined” if the 
neurological exam is worse, otherwise the clinical status sho uld be set to “improved” or “stable”. 
In the event that necessary clinical data is not available, clinical status should be recorded as “not 
available” and that particular time point can only be reviewed for PD (otherwise “non -evaluable”). 
Neurological dat a must be within ±7 days of the time -point response date, otherwise the data is 
considered “not available”.  
 
11.7 Steroid Use and Dose  
Steroid use should be derived from the concomitant medications on the case report forms and 
recorded as “Yes”, “No”, or “not available”. A value of “No” should be assigned if, at the time -
point, the subject is not on steroids or on physiologic replacement doses only (<2 mg 
dexamethasone or equivalent per day).  
Average steroid dose no greater than 2 mg change from baseline should be abstracted to “stable”. 
If outside this range the steroid dose should be abstracted to “increased” or “decreased” 
accordingly. Steroid data should be within ±5 days of the time -point response date, otherwise the 
data is considered “not available”.

CONFIDENTIAL   
11.8 Overall Objective Status  
The overall objective status for an evaluation should be determined by combining the patient’s 
radiographic response on target lesions, new disease, neurological status, and steroid dose/usage 
as defined in the table  below  for patients with  measurable  (>10mm x 10mm) disease. Note that 
patients with possible PsP or pseudoresponse should be given the Objective Status of “Preliminary 
Progression” or “Preliminary Response”, respectively. Once PsP, pseudoresponse, or true 
progression/response are confirmed,  the Objective Status can be changed accordingly.

CONFIDENTIAL  11.9 Detailed Modified Radiographic Response Assessment  
 
The diagram below indicates the modififed RANO treatment algorithm for the assessment of 
modified radiographic response in newly diagnosed glioblastoma:  
 
 
 
Preliminary Radiographic Progression  
If the lesion size has increased ≥25% sum of bidirectional product between MRI Scan 1 and N, 
these patients should be categorized as “preliminary radiographic progression”. If the 
investigator believes the patient can safely continue on therapy, then they should continue to 
treat and acquire a follow -up confirmatory scan [MRI(N  + 1)] at the next scan interval (8 
weeks ± 4 we eks from MRI Scan (N) or no less than 4 weeks minimum duration between 
preliminary PD and confirmed PD scans) to verify tumor growth an d progression. For patients 
with gross -total resection (GTR) and no measurable enhancing disease,  preliminary  radiographic 
progression is defined as a transition from  no measurable disease  to non-measureable  (but 
present ) disease (<10mm x 10mm ) or measurable disease  (>10mm x 10mm ). If the investigator 
feels it is safe to keep the patient on, a confirmatory scan at MRI(N  + 1) should be obtained to 
verify tumor progression.  
Confirmed Progression  
If the patient has an increase ≥25% sum of bidirectional product between MRI Scan N a nd N  + 1, 
this is “Confirmed Progression”,  the patient should stop therapy  and the date of radiographic 
progression is the date of suspected progression, MRI(N). If the patient has SD/PR/CR on 
MRI(N  + 1) with respect to MRI(N), PsP is confirmed and the patient should continue on 
therapy. Patients will then continue on therapy and  receive additional follow -up MRI scans 
[MRI(M)]. If the lesion size has increased ≥25% sum of bidirectional product on MRI(M) 
relative to the smaller of Nadir or MRI(N  + 1), then the patient has “Confirmed Progression”,  the 
patient should stop therapy  and the date of radiographic progression is the new date, MRI(M). 
For patients with no measurable disease at the Post -RT baseline, “Confirmed Progression” will 
be defined as a transition from  non-measurable  (but present ) disease  (<10mm x  <10mm ) on 
MRI(N) to  measurable disease  (>10mm x 10mm ) on MRI(N  + 1). For patients with confirmed 
PsP and no measurable disease at Nadir, “Confirmed Progression” should be defined as a 
transition from  no measurable disease  to measurable disease  (>10mm x 10mm ). In all cases, 
patients with confirmed progression should stop therapy.  

ATTAC -II   Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy  
Version: 20241007  Page 77 of 121 
CONFIDENTIAL  Preliminary Radiographic Response  
If a measurable lesion has decreased ≥50% sum of bidirectional product between MRI(1) and 
MRI(N), these patients should be categorized as “preliminary radiographic responders” and will 
be monitored for an additional time point and/or treatment cycle. After  an additional cycle of 
therapy (8 wee ks ± 4 w eeks from MRI(N)), patients will receive a confirmatory MRI( N + 1 ). 
Confirmed Radiographic Response  
If the lesion(s) have increased ≥25% sum of bidirectional product between MRI Scan N and 
N + 1, (indicating radiographic progression from MRI(N)), this is considered an “unsustained 
radiographic response” or “pseudoresponse”. These patients should be categorized as 
“preliminary radiographic progression”. If the investigator believes the patient can safely 
continue on therapy, then they should continue to treat and acquire a follow -up confirmatory 
scan [MRI(M)] at the next scan interval (8 wee ks ± 4 we eks from MRI Scan (N+1) or no less 
than 4 weeks minimum duration between preliminary PD and confirmed PD scans) to verify 
tumor growth and progression. If the patient has an increase ≥25% sum of bidirectional product 
between MRI Scan N +1 and M , this is “Confirmed Progression”,  the patient should stop therapy  
and the date of radiographic progression is the date of suspected progression, MRI(N +1). If th e 
patient has SD/PR/CR on MRI(M ) with respect to MRI(N +1), PsP is confirmed and the patient 
should continue on therapy. Patients will then continue on therapy and receive additional follow -
up MRI scans  [MRI(M)].  
Alternatively, if the lesion has not increased from MRI(N), this is considered a “durable 
radiographic response,” the patient will continue on therapy, and the date 
of preliminary  radiographic progression is the time point of an increase ≥25% sum of 
bidirectional product (from Nadir) during the remainder of the study. The investigator can then 
decide whether to continue safely on therapy until progression has been confirmed and at the 
subsequent time point stop therapy if they feel the patient cannot safely continue therapy.  
Stable Disease  
If the lesion size has not increased or decreased beyond the set thresholds between Scan 1 and N, 
the patient is considered “stable.” Such patients will continue on therapy, and the date 
of preliminary  progression is the time point of an increase ≥25% sum of bidirectional product 
(from Nadir) during the remainder of the study. Upon preliminary progression the investigator 
can choose to either continue therapy and confirm progression or discontinue thera py. For cases 
with significant neurologic decline at the time of imaging progression as determined from 
MRI(N), a confirmatory scan at time point MRI( N + 1)  may not be possible or necessary. For 
these cases, it is appropriate to define MRI(N) as the progre ssion time point.  
 
11.10   Clinical Judgement  
Treatment effects, necrosis, vasogenic edema and true tumor progression may appear similar on 
post contrast brain MRI. There is a continued effort to develop new tools and method to 
characterize these different outcomes. However, differentiating treatment effects from true 
progression in patients with high -grade glioma remains an ongoing challenge.  
Consequently, we propose to  provide some allowance for  clinical judgement when  deciding 
whether to discontinue DC vaccination when  there is a reasonable doubt  regarding  disease 
progression  versus treatment effects.  
ATTAC -II   Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy  
Version: 20241007  Page 78 of 121 
CONFIDENTIAL    
In the event of radiographic changes  that meet modified RANO criteria for  disease progression 
in clinically stable or improved patients,  vaccination treatment  may be continued at the discretion 
of the  PI in consultation with the treating physician, if  the PI believes that it is safe to continue 
therapy and that patients may benefit from the ongoing treatment regimen.   Subsequent 
evaluation by radiographic imaging, clinical evaluation, and/or surgery/biopsy that declares true 
tumor progression will result in  establishing the date of tumor progression at the time when the 
patient first met modified RANO criteria for documented tumor progression.   Therefore, it will 
not be deemed a protocol deviation for patients to have received subsequent DC vaccines during 
the interval of assessment for resolving tumor progression.  Given the primary endpoint of 
overall survival for this phase 2 study and above described difficulties in radiographic 
assessment in this patient population, an allowance for clinical judgement on  treatment 
discontinuation is warranted.   
 
11.11  Confirmation of Tumor Progression by Histopathology  
Due to the challenge of recognizing treatment effect from tumor progression, histological 
confirmation of tumor progression should be obtained when clinically indicated to avoid premature 
termination of effective treatment or continuing ineffective treatme nt.  
Tissue obtained by biopsy or resection will be used to confirm tumor progression histologically. 
If tumor progression is confirmed , ongoing treatment will be stopped and best of available care at 
the time of confirmed progression will be discussed wit h the patient.  
If obtained in sufficient quantity, available tissue will be used to evaluate cellular infiltration and 
CMV antigen expression at the tumor site.  
In the event that histopathology reveals inflammatory response, indicating toxic or therapeutic 
responses and not tumor progression, the patient may resume ongoing treatment at the discretion 
of the PI in consultation with the treating physician after the patient has recovered from the effect 
of biopsy/surgery.  
 
 IMMUNOLOGICAL RESPONSE EVALUATIONS  
 
Immunological response evaluations for baseline values will be conducted on PBMCs collected at 
the time of the initial leukapheresis sample.   Immunologic response evaluations will also be 
performed from  peripheral blood obtained prior to select  vaccination s.  The primary comparison 
for immunologic endpoints will be baseline response (pre -leukapheresis  or P1 ) compared to 
response post vaccine #3 (post -leukapheresis  or P2 ).  Our previous studies demonstrated a 
significant increase in immunologic responses in vaccinated patients that peaked after the third 
vaccine in most subjects.  A comparison of pre -therapy lymphocyte function to additional vaccine 
time points may be conducted on an exploratory basis. Arms 1 and 2 (pp65 -shLAMP RNA -pulsed 
DCs and pp65 -flLAMP RNA -pulsed DCs) will be analyzed separately for immunologic endpoint 
comparisons.  Studies examining DNA vaccines using full -length LAMP1 fusion antigens 
compared to truncated versions of the LAMP protein have demonstrated that increased antigen 
expression , secretion of LAMP fusion proteins, enhanced antibody titers, increased cytokine 
release by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, improved central memory T cell differentiation, and enhanced

CONFIDENTIAL  polyfunctional T cell responses, all were dependent on full -length LAMP1 fusion 
antigens(Godinho, Matassoli et al. 2014).  Truncated LAMP fusions that did not contain the 
luminal domain of LAMP were much less efficient in this wide spectrum of immunologic analyses.  
As a primary biologic analysis and secondary endpoint of this study, we will compare the 
immunologic responses in patients vaccinated with CMV pp65 -flLAMP RNA -pulsed DCs (Arm 
1) to patients vaccinated with CMV pp65 -shLAMP RNA -pulsed DCs  (Arm 2)  across this spectrum 
of responses.   
 
12.1 ELISPOT Assay  
The ELISPOT assay, our primary assay to detect cellular immune responses is a sensitive detection 
assay for evaluation of antigen -specific cytokine producing T -cells.  The IFN - ELISPOT allows 
for the direct visualization of human  -interferon cytokine release from a single cell, which has 
been widely reported to be an indicator of activation of an antigen -specific immune response.  
 
On the day of testing, PBMCs will be thawed quickly, washed, resuspended in R -10 medium and 
cell counts and viability measured PBMCs (250,000/well) will be stimulated overnight with 
synthetic peptides consisting of a peptide cocktail derived from human CMV  proteins.  Single -use 
aliquots of the peptide pools will be resuspended to a final concentration of 1 μg/mL for each 
peptide.  Each assay will include PBMC cultured with no peptide or PHA (2.5 μg/mL, 0.25 ug/mL) 
and positive and negative control PBMC for each antigen if available.  PBMC are added to 
duplicate wells of 96 -well ELISPOT assay plates coated with mouse IgG1 anti -human IFN -  
monoclonal antibody (MAb) will be incubated overnight at 37°C, 5% CO 2, washed with 
PBS/Tween 20, incubated with biotinylated mouse IgG1 anti -human IFN -  MAb for 1 hour at 
room temperature, washed with PBS, incubated with avidin -peroxidase complex for 1 hour at room 
temperature, washed, incubated with substrate (3 -amino -9-ethylcarbazole) for 4 min at room 
temperature and spo t development stopped by distilled water rinse.  Plates will be dried and 
shipped to Zellnet Consulting (New York, NY) for spot enumeration by automated analysis with 
a Zeiss KS ELISPOT system.  Results will be expressed as the mean spot -forming cells (SFC )/106 
PBMC after subtraction of counts from cells cultured with no peptide.  
 
12.2 Polyfunctional T cell Responses, T cell Phenotype, and Other 
Type of Immune Cell Phenotype   
The laboratory of UFBTIP will conduct a flow cytometric analysis that aims to quickly detect the 
activation of T cells through CD69 and exhaustion via PD -1. A 13 -color assay will be used to 
monitor the polyfunctional immune response of patients' CD4 and CD8 cells. The analysis will 
also include an examination of the phenotypic distribution of T cells that respond to the assay, 
including naive, effector, centra l memory, effector memory, and terminal effector cells. 
Additionally, the same panel will be used t o analyze regulatory T cells (identified as 
CD3+CD4+CD25+FoxP3+), natural killer cells (CD56+), natural killer T cells (CD56+CD3+), 
invariant natural killer T cells (CD56+CD3+TCR -va24+), and cell viability (measured through the 
Live/Dead Fixable Blue Viabi lity Assay) (as seen in Figure 13).

containing ACD.  PBMC will be separated by density gradient centrifugation on ficoll -Hypaque  
and then cryopreserved until the day of immune monitoring operation..  
 
    
12.3 Multiplex Cytokine Quantification  
The UFBTIP laboratory will perform a Multiplex cytokine analysis to detect multiple cytokines 
secreted by lymphocytes. This analysis will use a multiplex kit on the Meso Scale Discovery 
platform to simultaneously examine Type 0,1,2, and 3 cytokines (IFN -g, IL -1b, IL -2, IL -4, IL -6, 
IL-8, IL -10, IL12p70, IL -13, and TNF -a) secreted by T cells. Prior to select vaccinations, 
peripheral blood will be dr awn into vacutainer tubes containing silicone and micronized silica 
particales (SST) to isolate patient serum. This serum will be cryopreserved until the day of the 
Multiplex cytokine assay.

 SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING  
 
13.1 Dose -limiting Toxicity  
DLTs will be evaluated according to NCI CTC AE (Version 5.0) criteria.   
 
A DLT will be defined as a possibly, probably or definitely drug -related : 
- Grade IV toxicity  (with the exception of grade IV cerebral edema ) or any non -neurologic 
toxicity ≥ Grade III toxicity of any duration.  
- Grade III neurologic toxicity if not improved to Grade ≤ II within 7 days of clinical 
management will be declared a DLT . 
Neurotoxicity that improves to Grade II within 7 days will be allowed an additional 21 -day 
management period to resolve to a Grade I or return to patient baseline. If the event does 
not improve  to a Grade I or return to patient’s baseline within 21 days of management,  it 
will then be declared a DLT  
 
Immune -related neuro toxicities  are a recognized adverse event  associated with  immunotherapy. 
Symptoms  may present throughout the course of  treatment  and involve the peripheral and central 
nervous system , and usually respond well to steroids, if started early. Early  recognition of 
neurological toxicity is critical for the initiation of clinical management or surgical intervention  to 
prevent or potentially reverse neurological sequelae.  If neurological toxicity improved to ≤ Grade 
I within 28 days  of clinical  management, patient may resume treatment . 
 
Non-neurologic Grade III and a ny Grade IV toxicity or any life -threatening event  not 
attributable to a concomitant medication, co -morbid event, or disease progression, even if 
reversible, will be considered a DLT.  If biopsy cannot be obtained, any new radiographic or 
clinical changes not attributable to tumor progression that produce  a non-neurologic Grade III or 
any Grade IV or life -threatening toxicity will be considered at DLT.  Life -threatening events, as 
described above, even if considered a Grade III  toxicity, will still be considered a DLT even if 
reversible and in such cases no further vaccinations will be given.  
 
If a neurologic Grade III NCI CTC toxicity  is seen that is not attributable to a concomitant 
medication, co -morbid event, or disease progression that has been documented radiographically 
or clinically, the next immunization for that patient will be withheld for up to 2 months or until the 
NCI CTC toxicity improves to a Grade  ≤ I or until the KPS score returns to within 10 points of 
ATTAC -II   Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy  
Version: 20241007  Page 82 of 121 
CONFIDENTIAL  baseline.  Grade III neurologic toxicities will be declared irreversible if they cannot be reversed 
within 4  weeks  of clinical management .  If the event has not improved to a Grade ≤ II within 7 
days of clinical management  (then to ≤ Grade I or baseline within 21 days) , a DLT will be declared 
for that patient and no further vaccinations or study -related procedures will be performed.  If the 
event is reversed, but Grade III NCI CTC neurologic toxicity is again seen with subsequent 
vaccinations, all further vaccinations and study -related procedures will be withheld and a DLT 
will be declared.  Medical therapy or surgical intervention, may be used to reverse any toxicity if 
necessary . 
 
In the case of hypersensitivity reactions, treatment measures deemed medically appropriate will 
be initiated and the PI notified of the event.  Although not considered a DLT, any patient with ≥ 
Grade II urticaria will not receive further vaccines and will be withdrawn from the study.     
 
Cerebral edema toxicity exception:  
Cerebral edema normally presents in glioblastoma patient s as part of the disease  process  and can 
be exacerbated by standard of care chemotherapy and radiation. Furthermore, an  effective anti -
tumor immune response may involve inflammatory response and edema in infiltrative tumor cells.  
 
Therefore, we propose that worsening cerebral edema (noted by MRI) that is not associated with 
changes in neurological symptoms will not constitute a DLT, but worsening cerebral edema in 
association with Grade 3 or greater other neurologic toxicities will be managed with above outlined 
criteria (improvement to < Grade 2 within 7 days and to Grade 1 or baseline within 21 days or will 
be declared a DLT).   Radiographic improvement of cerebral edema will be noted, but since NCI 
CTCAE v5.0 guidelines do not allo w for an improvement in cerebral edema Grade < 3, the CTC AE 
grading criteria for cerebral edema will be exempted from DLT assessment.  
Grade III or greater toxicities associated with DC -based immunotherapy have been rare.  Adoptive 
T cell therapy using tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes and high -dose IL -2 in patients with melanoma 
and treatment with anti -CLTA -4 monoclonal antibody blockade ha ve been the immunotherapy 
regimens most often associated with treatment related toxicities.  To take the most conservative 
approach to assessing possible toxicities associated with this treatment, we will be vigilant for any 
similar toxicity associated wit h this therapy, in addition to autoimmune toxicity specific to the 
CNS. Possible immune -mediated disorders that have been observed in patients who have received 
immunotherapy in early phase trials have involved the skin (vitiligo and cutaneous 
leukocytocla stic vasculitis), the thyroid gland (autoimmune thyroiditis), the liver (autoimmune 
hepatitis) and the pituitary (hypophysitis). Abnormal lab results, which may be immune -mediated, 
include elevations of serum lipase and amylase and liver function tests. If  a patient has an AE that 
is thought to be possibly related to autoimmune antibodies (eg, thyroiditis, hepatitis, 
thrombocytopenia) the PI will send a blood sample for appropriate autoimmune antibody testing. 
If specific autoantibodies are present, the ser um sample taken for storage at baseline will be tested 
for the presence of those autoantibodies. Further immunotherapy treatment in that patient will be 
held until the etiology of the event is established.  
 
 
13.2 Stopping Rules  
 
ATTAC -II   Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy  
Version: 20241007  Page 83 of 121 
CONFIDENTIAL  To continuously monitor vaccine -related toxicity, we will use a one -sided Pocock -type sequential 
boundary (Ivanova et al. 2005) to repeatedly test whether a maximum acceptable DLT rate 
T=14.3% (1 patient in 7) has been exceeded. The sequential boundary wil l consist of the minimum 
cumulative number of patients experiencing DLTs per concurrent number of patients enrolled that 
would result in a rejection of the null hypothesis T≤14.3% and halting of the trial. The sequential 
boundary will be adjusted so that t he overall probability of stopping the trial across the accrual of 
all 80 patients in the two treatment arms of the trial (i.e. the overall Type 1 error rate) is 0.05 when 
T=14.3%. If the trial runs to completion without being halted for excessive toxicity , insight into 
the magnitude of the true DLT rate can be gained by noting that the sequential boundary 
established for T=14.3% has a >80% overall chance of stopping the trial if in fact T is actually 
greater than 27.1%. The sequential boundary for T=14.3% and stopping probability 0.05 is 
displayed in the following table:

N = Number of patients enrolled  
PB = Pocock boundary, the minimum cumulative number of patients  
     experiencing vaccine -related toxicity that should stop the trial  
     when the concurrent number of patients enrolled in the trial is N  
 
The safety monitoring rule described for vaccine -related toxicity was derived using methods 
described by Ivanova et al. (Ivanova A, BF Qaqish, and MJ Schell, 2005. Continuous toxicity 
monitoring in phase II trials in oncology. Biometrics 61: 540 -545). Poco ck boundaries were 
calculated using an online calculator maintained by one of the authors at the UNC Lineberger 
Comprehensive Cancer Center website:  
(http://cancer.unc.edu/biostatistics/program/ivanova/ContinuosMonitoringForToxicity.aspx).  
 
 
13.3 Adverse Event s 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with use of a drug, whether or not 
considered drug related . For this protocol, the definition of AE also includes worsening of any pre -
existing medical condition. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended or worsening 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associ ated with 
the use of the study drug, whether or not related to use of the study drug. Abnormal laboratory 
findings without clinical significance  (based on the PI’s judgment) should not be recorded as AEs. 
But laboratory value changes that require therapy or adjustment in prior therapy are considered 
adverse events.  Elective and semi -elective surgery in asymptomatic patients should not be 
recorded as AEs.  
ATTAC -II   Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy  
Version: 20241007  Page 84 of 121 
CONFIDENTIAL   
An adverse drug reaction is any adve rse event caused by a drug.  A  suspected adverse reaction  
means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse 
event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, "reasonable possibility" means there is evidence 
to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and th e adverse event.  
 
AE collection will begin at the time of administration of vaccine #1  and continue until 30 days 
after the last dose of study drug.  Grade 2 suspected adverse reactions and a ll Grade 3 or greater 
AEs must be recorded in the subject’s research record and entered into the OnCore  eCRF within 
72 hours of PI discovery/notification of the event .  Any Grade 3 or greater adverse events 
associated with leukapheresis will also be recorded.   AEs must also be reported to the Coordinating 
Center as described in 13.3.    
 
AEs will be assessed according to the CTCAE version 5.0 (term and grade)  and documented .  If 
CTCAE  term does not exist, the PI should select the most appropriate CTC category and indicate 
“other”.  If CTCAE  grading does not exist for an AE, the severity of the AE will be graded as (1)  
mild, (2) moderate , (3) severe , (4) life-threatening, or (5) fatal.  
 
Attribution of AEs will be assigned by the PI as follows:  
▪ Definite:  The AE is clearly related to the study drug  
▪ Probabl e:  The AE is likely related to the study drug  
▪ Possible:  The AE may be related to the study drug  
▪ Unlikely:  The AE is doubtfully related to the study drug  
▪ Unrelated:  The AE is clearly NOT related to the study drug  
 
An adverse event is considered a Serious Adverse Event if it results in any of t he following 
outcome s: 1) fatal or life threatening; 2) inpatient hospitalization or a prolongation of existing 
hospitalization; 3) a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption 
in the patient's body function/structure, physical activities and/or quality of life ; 4) congenital 
anomaly or a birth defect and/or; 5) medically significant such that it may jeopardize the subject, 
and may require medi cal or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
 
An unexpected adverse event  or unexpected suspected adverse reaction is a n adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction that is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed  or is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the IND application (if there is no 
investigator brochure) . 
 
A summary of all Grade 3 or greater adverse events (not just those considered related to the 
vaccine) will be maintained.  Events will be categorized by organ system, relationship to treatment, 
grade or severity, and outcome .  The Protocol Chair will periodically review the adverse event  
summary with the intention of identifying any trends or patterns in toxicity.  If any such trends are 
identified, depending on their severity , frequency , and timing with respect to treatment , the 
Protocol Chair may request that the events be evaluated by a convened data safety monitoring 
board .

CONFIDENTIAL  13.4 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  Reporting  
All adverse events grade 2 or greater where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
(possible, probable or definite) between the AE and investigational drug or study participation and 
all serious adverse events (regardless of causality) occurrin g at participating sites during the AE 
reporting periods require expedited reporting  to the Coordinating Center.  
 
Adverse events meeting the definition of an SAE  and any grade 2 or greater AEs where there is a 
possible, probable or definite relationship between the AE and investigational drug  must be 
reported to the Coordinating Center within 24 hours of the investigator’s discovery.      Initial 
notification may be via  e-mail.  A formal written initial report using UFBTIP Serious Adverse 
(SAE) Report  must be sent to the Coordinating Center per the reporting timeframes outlined 
above.   SAE s and AE  requirings expedited reporting  must be entered into the OnCore eCRF  as 
soon as possible but no later than 72 hours after discovery.    
   
All other AEs grade 3 or greater will be documented in the OnCore database for Protocol Chair 
review during the investigation.  
 
The Protocol Chair will promptly review  expedited  investigator reports  and communicate the AE 
assessment to the reporting investigator  and IND sponsor s, as applicable .  If the AE meets FDA 
reporting requirements  as described in 13.3.2 , site PIs and IND sponsors will be notified and  the 
IND sponsor s will be responsible for reporting  to FDA under the IND s regardless of which site 
initially reported the AE .   
 
If a death occurs within 30 days of DC vaccine administration, that is not attributable to progressive 
disease or other obvious non -study related cause (i.e. motor vehicle accident), enrollment of new 
subjects will be suspended until review by the Protocol  Chair  and IND Sponsor  has been completed 
and the FDA notified.   If attribution of death is determined by the Protocol Chair , IND Sponsor  or 
FDA to be possibly, probably or definitely related to trial drug, continued treatment of all enrolled 
subjects with  trial drug will be suspended until the review is completed and recommendations for 
study continuation have been issued and approved by FDA.   Any death attributed to trial drug, 
regardless of the timeline with respect to last treatment, will result in susp ension of enrollment and 
suspension of continued treatment for enrolled subjects until review by FDA is complete , and 
recommendations for study continuation issued and approved.   The IRB and DSMB will be 
notified of subject deaths per local policy.   Deaths  or life -threatening adverse events will be 
reported to FDA by the IND sponsor s as soon as possible but no later than 7 calendar days after 
the sponsor's initial receipt of the information (21 CFR 312.32).

13.4.3   Adverse Event Reporting to the FDA  
Safety reporting will be in accordance with FDA requirement s.  It is the responsibility  of the IND 
sponsor  to report to the FDA  in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32  as follows:  
 
• Report any unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reactions associated with use 
of the drug by telephone or fax  as soon as possible but  no later than 7 calendar days  after 
initial receipt of the information.   
• Report any serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions if there is evidence to suggest 
a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event , as well as results from animal 
studies that suggest significant clinical risk within 15 calendar days  after receipt of this 
information.   
 
A summary of Grade II (related) and Grade III toxicities, all IND safety reports and subject deaths 
during participation in the investigation will be submitted  by the sponsor  with the IND annual 
report.  
 
13.4.4  Adverse Event Reporting to Sites  
The Coordinating Center  will notify site PIs  of any adverse events associated with the use of the 
investigational vaccine that is both serious and unexpected  within 15 calendar  days  of the 
notificat ion of the event.   These reports should be submitted to the IRB of record in accordance 
with local policy.   Any changes to the protocol and/or consent will be initiated  by the Coordinating 
Center and distributed to participating sites  for review by the IRB .

CONFIDENTIAL  13.5 Potential Risks  
13.5.1  Allergic Reactions to DC Immunization  
Injection of antigen presenting cells may result in an allergic reaction, which could include redness 
and swelling at the injection site, itching, hives, low blood pressure, difficulty breathing, or in the 
most extreme circumstances, death.  In addition, i f the immune system becomes overly activated, 
potential discomforts may include pain, redness and swelling at the injection site.   
 
13.5.2  Cerebral Edema  
Cerebral edema may be secondary to the disease process itself, the surgical procedure, necrosis 
from previous radiation, or inflammation due to immune infiltration of the brain or destruction of 
tumor cells.  Symptoms may include, but are not limited to, s evere headache, confusion, lethargy, 
unresponsiveness, coma, or focal neurological deficits.  Patients will be monitored throughout the 
course of the study and those patients with any signs or symptoms of cerebral edema may need 
their steroid doses increas ed, treatment with an osmotic diuretic, or surgical decompression.  
Edema that fails to respond to aggressive therapy may lead to permanent neurological impairment.  
The probability of this risk can be predicted to some degree based upon tumor size, locati on, pre -
operative neurological impairment, and post -operative course prior to DC injections. Patients will 
be monitored throughout the course of the study.  
 
13.5.3  Infection  
The DC  or PBMC  injections may include the risk of infection due to potential contamination in 
the laboratory.  This may result in localized redness, swelling, or induration at the injection site.  
In the most extreme situation, this may lead to systemic bacterial/fungal sepsis and possibly death.  
The probability of this risk is relatively low, g iven the small injection volume and the fact that the 
DCs and PBMCs  will be strictly tested for sterility.  The risk of infection due to potential 
contamination of the DCs  and PBMCs  in the laboratory will be minimized by biosafety quality 
assurance and testing.  All cell cultures will be handled in a core tissue culture facility dedicated 
to the processing of human cells.  Following injections, patients will be monitored throughout the 
course of the study for any signs and symptoms of infection. If an active infection is suspected, 
patients will b e cultured and treated with appropriate antibiotics.  
 
13.5.4  Delayed Autoimmune Diseases  
It is possible that delayed autoimmune disease(s) may develop as a result of injection with DCs or 
PBMCs .  This means that the immune system may be stimulated to attack natural tissue in the 
body.  Animal studies have reported the development of autoimmunity in the context of 
vaccination and recovery from lymphopenia.  However, our current experience with DC  and 
PBMC vaccination in glioma patients has not demonstrated evidence of autoimmunity in treated 
patients.  It therefore, is unknown what the risk of d elayed autoimmune disease is for this study.   
 
13.5.5  Phlebotomy  
Drawing blood or inserting an intravenous catheter into an arm vein may result in bruising or 
swelling in the area of the insertion, bleeding at the site of the needle puncture, light headedness, 
fainting and very rarely, local infection, which may be seve re.  
 
ATTAC -II   Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy  
Version: 20241007  Page 88 of 121 
CONFIDENTIAL  13.5.6  Leukapheresis  
As with any donation of blood, a variety of minor reactions may occur with leukaph eresis, which 
include fainting, dizziness, or nausea.  Uncommon but serious complications may also result, 
which include bleeding, infection, an adverse reaction to the anticoagulant or replacement fluids, 
hypocalcemia, hypotension, shock, convulsions, air emboli, heart failure, or the inability to 
transfuse blood back into the patient.  These risks are reduced by the fact that the procedure will 
be performed by qualified staf f at a specialized clinical hemapheresis unit.  Patients will be 
carefully monitored throughout the procedure by trained nursing and medical staff.  Calcium 
gluconate (2 mg PO) may be given to minimize the risks of hypocalcemia, fluid supplementation 
may be given to minimize hypotension, and blood will be routinely screened for infectious disease 
in accordance with institutional practices  to minimize the risk of transmitting infection.  
 
13.5.7  Central Venous Catheter  
Some patient may require placement of a dialysis -type central venous catheter for the 
leukapheresis procedure. Separate operative/procedural consent will be obtained from the 
surgeon/proceduralist placing the central line. The surgeon/proceduralist may use  fluoroscopy to 
place the central venous catheter and ensure that it is in a satisfactory position. Fluoroscopy 
involves low dose radiation and is low risk.  Risk of central line placement include (but not limited 
to): bruising, bleeding, injury to the ves sel which may be permanent, possible injury to adjacent 
structures/organs, pneumothorax, infection and postoperative pain/discomfort. Removal of the 
central line is low risk but does include possible thrombosis or stenosis of the vessel. This may 
prevent future use of this vessel for additional leukapheresis.  
 
13.5.8  MRI  
The risks and/or discomforts associated with the performance of MRI  include the anxiety produced 
from being in a tight, enclosed space (claustrophobia).  In addition, the machine operates using a 
large and powerful magnet.  The magnetism of the machine attracts certain metals: therefore, 
people with these metals in their b odies (specifically pacemakers, infusion pumps, metal aneurysm 
clips, metal prostheses, joints, rods or plates) will  imaged by CT scan . Patients will also be checked 
to make sure that they  do not bring any metal objects into the MRI facility.  Dental fillings are less 
affected by the magnetic fields generated and are therefore permitted.  It will be asked that patients 
let the physicians conducting this study know of any metal in their bodi es other than dental fillings.   
 
13.5.9  GM-CSF  
Injection of GM -CSF may increase the risk of infection, lower platelets, or cause fluid retention.  
GM-CSF also may result in an allergic reaction, which could include redness and swelling at the 
injection site, itching, hives, flushing, syncope, low blood  pressure, difficulty breathing, or in the 
most extreme circumstances, death.  In addition, if the immune system becomes overly activated, 
potential discomforts may include pain, redness and swelling at the injection site . 
 
13.5.10  Td 
The following adverse events have been identified during post -approval use of MassBiologics’ 
Td.  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not 
always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to 
vaccination.  The following adverse events were included because of seriousness or frequency of 
reporting: injection site reactions, including pain, tenderness, erythema, induration, pruritis, 
ATTAC -II   Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy  
Version: 20241007  Page 89 of 121 
CONFIDENTIAL  swelling and warmth; peripheral edema, pyrexia, malaise ; dizziness, headache, convulsions , 
myalgia, musculoskeletal stiffness or pain, arthralgia ; rash; nausea; and cellulitis.  
 
13.5.11  Allergic Reactions to Contrast Agents  
During the MRI, patients will be given a contrast agent.  The agent is given routinely to obtain 
enhanced MRI scans of the brain.  The agent is administered through the vein and requires the 
placement of an IV catheter.  The catheter placement is similar to drawing blood except that the 
catheter remains in the vein during the time the agent is actively delivered.  The risks of a blood 
draw and insertion of a catheter are similar.  There have b een a few, rare cases of allergies to the 
agent used in MRI contrast enhanced scans. Patients with any known severe allergies to contrast 
agents will be excluded from the study.  Patients with mild allergies (i.e., rash only) will be 
pretreated with Tyleno l and Benadryl prior to injection of the contrast agent.  
 
13.5.12  Temozolomide  
TMZ  has been well tolerated by both adults and children with the most common toxicity being 
mild myelosuppression.  Other, less likely, potential toxicities include nausea and vomiting, 
constipation, headache, alopecia, rash, burning sensation of skin, esopha gitis, pain, diarrhea, 
lethargy, hepatotoxicity, anorexia, fatigue and hyperglycemia.  Hypersensitivity reactions have not 
yet been noted with TMZ .  As in the case with many anti -cancer drugs, TMZ  may be carcinogenic.  
Rats given TMZ have developed brea st cancer.  The significance of this finding for human is not 
presently known. TMZ  therapy will be followed but given as standard of care. If toxicities occur, 
the Princip al Investigator and primary physician will titrate therapy based on standard clinical 
guidelines . 
 
13.5.13  Confidentiality  
Participation in research may result in a loss of privacy if confidentiality is breached .  Only 
designated  members of the study team will have access to individually identifiable private 
information.  Data collected from clinical records  or patients  will be recorded in OnCORE that 
uses Gatorlink authentication .  Clinical records containing PHI will be maintained as source 
documentation and stored in secure, limited access, locked offices.   Records will be  made  
available to individuals involved with the stud y, the clinical staff administering the study, and 
regulatory representatives such as the IRB, FDA, OHRP and funding agency. Any publications 
resulting from this study will not include patient identifying data.

14.1.1  Data Monitoring Plan  
Adverse events meeting the definition of an SAE and any grade 2 or greater AEs where there is a 
possible, probable or definite relationship between the AE and investigational drug must be 
reported to the Coordinating Center within 24 hours of the investigator’s discovery.   These will be 
assessed by the Protocol Chair and reported to the IRB, DSMB, FD A and other participating 
investigators as outlined in the protocol.  
 
ATTAC -II   Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy  
Version: 20241007  Page 90 of 121 
CONFIDENTIAL  The UFHCC SRMC conducts initial review of IITs and determines the level of risk which 
corresponds with DISC review requirements.   The UFHCC DISC will conduct monitoring and 
audit activities as outlined in the DISC Charter.   The results of such activities will be provided to 
the PI, IND sponsor and IRB.  
 
The UF study team will conduct annual QA self -assessments that include review of regulatory 
documentation (e.g., IRB documentation, FDA IND records, IND Sponsor -Investigator 
responsibilities), recruitment procedures, informed consent process/form documenta tion, subject 
selection, AE and SAE reporting, CRF and source documents.  
 
The Coordinating Center will periodically review data entry and source documents uploaded into 
OnCore or other electronic source, and notify sites of missing, incomplete or inconsistent data as 
applicable.  
 
Orlando Health  Cancer Institute  site data will be monitored by the coordinating center lead 
coordinator and regulatory manager by reviewing source documents uploaded in the study 
database (UF OnCore).  
 
Duke will manufacture their own IP under their own IND and will perform site -specific monitoring 
that will be reported to the Coordinating Center/Protocol Chair as described in the protocol.  
 
14.1.2  Data Safety Monitoring Board  
Oversight and monitoring of study related activities such as the safety of research participants, 
appropriateness of the study, and integrity of the data, will be provided by the University of Florida 
Health Cancer Center  DSMB, now called the  Data Integrity and Safety Committee  (UFHCC 
DISC ), in accordance with established policies, procedures and timeframes .  DISC reports  and 
correspondence  will be provided to participating investigators for  review and  submission to local  
oversight committees  as required .. All reports generated by Duke  pertaining to study conduct , will 
be sent to the University of Florida PI and Protocol Chair.  DSMB reports should be submitted to 
the IRB per local policy.  
 
14.2 Audits  
An IRB or other local oversight group may conduct audits to evaluate compliance with the protocol 
and the principles of GCP. The PI will provide the auditor(s) with direct access to all relevant 
documents and to allocate his/her time and the time of the study team to the auditor(s) in order to 
discuss findings and any relevant issues.  
 
Audits are designed to protect the rights and well -being of human research subjects. Audits may 
be routine or directed (for cause). Routine audits are selected based upon risk metrics generally 
geared towards high subject enrollment, studies with limited o versight or monitoring, Investigator 
initiated Investigational Drugs or Devices, federally -funded studies, high degree of risk (based 
upon adverse events, type of study, or vulnerable populations ), Phase I studies, or studies that 
involve Medicare populati ons.  Directed audits occur at the directive of the IRB or an authorized 
Institutional Official.  
 
ATTAC -II   Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy  
Version: 20241007  Page 91 of 121 
CONFIDENTIAL  Audits examine research studies/clinical trials methodology, processes and systems to assess 
whether the research is conducted according to the protocol approved by the IRB. The primary 
purpose of the audit/review is to verify that the standards for safety  of human subjects in clinical 
trials and the quality of data produced by the clinical trial research are met. The audit/review will 
serve as a quality assurance measure, internal to the institution. Additional goals of such audits are 
to detect both rando m and systemic errors occurring during the conduct of clinical research and to 
emphasize “best practices” in the research/clinical trials environment.  
 
Duke University and the University of Florida have an auditing mechanism in place and each 
institution will be responsible for auditing their respective data.  Additionally, Duke University 
will send copies of all audit findings to the University of Florid a who, based on these findings, can 
request additional documentation or conduct an on -site visit.  
 
14.3 Data Management and Processing  
14.3.1  Study Documentation  
Study documentation includes but is not limited to source documents, case report forms, 
screening/enrollment, delegation of authority and monitoring logs  (as applicable) , appointment 
schedules, correspondence with sponsors or regulatory bodies/committees, and regulatory 
documents that can be found in the “Regulatory Binder”  (electronic or hard copy) , which includes 
but is not limited to signed protocol , amendments,  and investigator’s brochure (as applicable),  
approved and signed informed consent forms,  IRB submission documents, approvals and 
correspondence, CVs for investigators and sub -investigators,  FDA Form 1572,  financial disclosure 
forms,  laboratory certifications  and reference ranges , and clinical supplies receipts and distribution 
records.  
 
Source documents are original records that contain source data, which is all information in original 
records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the 
reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. Source do cuments include but are not limited to hospital 
records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation 
checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or 
transcriptions ce rtified after verification as being accurate copies, microfiches, photographic 
negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at 
the laboratories and at medico -technical departments involved in the clinical  trial. When possible, 
the original record should be retained as the source document. However, a photocopy is acceptable 
provided that it is a clear, legible, and an exact duplication of the original document.  
 
14.3.2  Site Activation  
A site is considered activated when the site has received official written d ocumentation from the 
Protocol Coordinating Center that the site has been approved to begin enrollment.  At a minimum, 
each participating  clinical site must have the following documentation  on file at UF prior to study 
activation : 
• IRB approval of the study in the form of a letter or other official document from the 
participating institution’s IRB  of record .  Th is documentation must show the version 
of the protocol approved by the IRB.  
• IRB approval of an informed consent form. The consent must include a statement that 
data will be shared with UF, including the UFHCC , the DS MB (if applicable), and the 
ATTAC -II   Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy  
Version: 20241007  Page 92 of 121 
CONFIDENTIAL  UF study team.  
• Protocol signature page signed and dated by the investigator at each participating site.  
 
The applicable IND sponsor is responsible for obtaining and maintaining signed  and dated  FDA 
Form 1572, and the CVs, applicable licenses and FDFs of all investigators  listed on the 1572 . 
 
The Coordinating Center  is responsible for disseminating study  updates, protocol and/or 
investigator brochure amendments, reportable adverse events,  and informed consent modifications 
to all participating sites .  Protocol/consent modifications and IB updates will be forwarded 
electronically to participating  sites within 4 weeks of UF IRB approval.  Activated participating 
sites are expected to submit protocol/consent/IB modifications to their local IRBs within 4 weeks 
of receipt unless otherwise noted.  Documentation of IRB approval should be provided to the 
Coordinating Center within 2 weeks of receipt of approval.   The Coordinating Center should 
review all revised consent forms prior to submission to the IRB.  
 
Documentation of participating sites’ IRB approval of annual continuing reviews, protoc ol 
amendments or revisions, SAE reports, and any protocol violations/deviations/exceptions must be 
on file at UF.   
 
The investigator or a designee from each in stitution must participate in conference call s, as 
scheduled,  to update and provide information regarding the progress of the trial.  
 
14.3.3  Case Report Forms  
Electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will be utilized for this trial.  Only the PI and key study 
personnel  listed on the study delegation log  are permitted to make entries, changes, or corrections 
in the case report forms.   Source documents that support data entry should be available for 
monitoring or audit.   The Coordinating Center will periodically review data  entry  and notify sites 
of missing, incomplete or inconsistent data.  
 
14.3.4  Data Management Procedures and Data Verification  
Users of the electronic CRF will have access based on their delegated specific roles on the study.  
Completeness of entered data will be checked and cross -referenced to verify accuracy. Missing or 
implausible data will be highlighted for the PI requiring appropriate responses (i.e. confirmation

 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS  
 
15.1 Study Design  Overview  
The primary goal of this randomized phase II study is to determine whether the addition of pp65 -
LAMP mRNA DC vaccination in adult patients with newly -diagnosed GBM receiving dose -
intensified TMZ will be a treatment worthy of investigation in a large phase III study.  A secondary 
ATTAC -II   Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy  
Version: 20241007  Page 93 of 121 
CONFIDENTIAL  objective will be examination of the immunologic responses induced by full -length vs short LAMP 
sequences.  
 
Although this randomized phase II study is comparative, it will not be definitive as the assessment 
will be conducted with a large false -positive rate.  We have included a concurrently followed 
control arm in the trial design in lieu of a historical contro l group to ensure that appropriate 
comparisons can be made without concern that the patients receiving standard treatment differ in 
prognostic factors or standards of care (Rubinstein, 2009; Ratain and Sargent, 2009; Rubinstein et 
al., 2005).  
 
We will randomize eligible  patients , after enrollment , to one of 3 study arms in which they will 
receive 21 -day TMZ concurrently with one of the following treatments:  
 
Arm #  Vaccine  Skin Preparation  
1 pp65 -shLAMP mRNA DCs with GM -CSF  Tetanus  
2 pp65 -flLAMP mRNA DCs with GM -CSF  Tetanus  
3 PBMCs  Saline  
 
Randomization will be stratified by : 
- Age 69 years old and younger; or 70 years old and older  
- RPA Class (III, IV, or V)  
- CMV seronegative or seropositive  
 
We will use a permuted block randomization scheme with a 1:1:1 study arm allocation ratio. and a 
block size  of 6 within each stratum.

Approximately 200 patients will be enrolled in the study , randomized  and receive  “standard -of-
care” radiotherapy concurrent with TMZ under the assumption that approximately 120 patients 
will be vaccinated according  to treatment  arm. 
 
A Data Sharing Agreement has been established with Immunomic Therapeutics , Inc.  and the 
University of Florida.   A Limited Data Set will be sent to evaluate immunogenicity and clinical 
efficacy of the vaccine products used within this  clinical trial  (for patients treated at the UF site 
ATTAC -II   Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy  
Version: 20241007  Page 94 of 121 
CONFIDENTIAL  only)  in which Immunomic Therapeutics , Inc.  has scientific and potential commercial interest.  
Data will be provided with in 6 months of study completion .  Applicable  patient identifiers will be 
removed before sending the limited data set.   A separate data sharing agreement may be established 
by Immunomic Therapeutics, Inc. with Duke University.  
  
15.2 Sample Size Justification for Vaccine Comparison  
The primary focus of this trial will be to assess the worthiness of pp65 -LAMP mRNA DC vaccine 
for further investigation by comparing overall survival (OS) between the active treatment group 
(Arms 1 and 2 combined) and the control group (Arm 3).  Because this test for efficacy will be 
made within the framework of a phase II trial, we have constrained sample size requirements to 
yield adequate power to detect a clinically releva nt improvement in OS at the expense of the false 
positive rate (α -level or Type I error rate).  Adopting guidelines proposed by Ratain and Sargent 
(2009) and Rubinstein et al (2005), our proposed sample size of 40 + 40 = 80 patients in the 
treatment group and 40 patients in the control group will allow detection of a clinically relevant 
improvement in the median OS time of the treatment group with 90% power at a one -sided α -level 
of 0.2.  
 
In determining the effect size that can be detected by our proposed sample size, we considered 
using as a control reference level the median OS estimate of 14.6 months (95% CI: 13.2 to 16.8) 
reported by Stupp et al (2005) for patients receiving radiotherap y plus TMZ (RT+TMZ) for newly -
diagnosed GBM (40% of patients in the Stupp trial were grossly resected).  In the Stupp trial , 
randomization  occurred prior to any post -surgical treatment, and the timing of  randomization in 
our study will be similar. However,  in our study, patients will not begin to experience potential 
differential effects due to treatment until after their first vaccination, which will occur 
approximately 15 weeks after randomization. To determine an appropriate control reference level 
for median OS for an index day 15 weeks after randomization , we carefully transferred the 
coordinates of multiple points along the Stupp RT+TMZ OS curve into a statistical software 
package . We determined that median OS relative to a starting time 15 weeks after  the Stupp index 
day would be 13.8 months.  We also observed that RT+TMZ OS times appeared to approximately 
follow a Weibull distribution with a shape parameter = 1. 20, indicating a slightly accelerating 
baseline hazard function.  Upon examining in a similar manner the RT+TMZ OS curve reported 
in the paper by Gilbert et al (2013), we also observed approximately Weibull -distributed OS times 
with shape parameter = 1.16.  
 
We therefore used 13. 8 months as the median OS reference level for our control group and 
assumed Weibull -distributed OS times with a common shape parameter value for both the 
treatment and control groups.  This is equivalent to assuming Weibull -distributed OS times with 
proport ional hazards between the treatment and control groups.  
 
Using methods adapted from Wu and Xiong (2014), we calculated improvement in median OS (or 
equivalently, the largest treatment vs. control hazard ratio less than 1) that could be detected by a 
log rank test with 90% power at 1 -sided α=0.20, for selected We ibull shape parameter values 
ranging from 1.00 (equivalent to exponential survival with constant hazard) to 1.25 (accelerating 
hazard).  We assumed 120 patients would be randomized and proceed to vaccination at a uniform 
rate over a 3 -year accrual period . These patients would then be followed after the end of accrual 
for one additional year.  As summarized in the following table, 77 deaths (expected by follow -up 
ATTAC -II   Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy  
Version: 20241007  Page 95 of 121 
CONFIDENTIAL  times ranging from 45.1 to 48 .9 months, depending on the degree of hazard acceleration  assumed ) 
will allow a treatment vs. control hazard ratio of 0.6 to be detected with sufficient power.  
Equivalently, improvement in median OS ranging from 7.0 to 9.2 months (again, depending on 
the degree of hazard acceleration  assumed ) can be detected with sufficient power.  
 
Improvement in median overall survival (Surv50) that can be detected at 90% power and a 
one-sided alpha -level of 0.20, for possible Weibull shape parameters characterizing the 
degree of hazard acceleration:

15.3 Analytic Methods  
15.3.1   Primary Objective and Secondary Clinical Objectives  
We will use Kaplan -Meier survival curves and the log rank test to characterize and compare PFS 
and OS in patients who received pp65 -LAMP mRNA DC vaccine (Arms 1 and 2) and in control 
patients (Arm 3).  PFS is defined as the time between first vaccination  and first documentation of 
either disease progression/recurrence, or death without prior progression/recurrence.  Patients 
remaining alive without disease progression will have PFS censored at last follow -up.  OS will be 
defined as the time between first va ccination  and death, and will be censored at the last follow -up 
if death has not occurred.  We will also perform a stratified analysis incorporating the three  
stratification variables (age, RPA class, and CMV sero -status) using Cox proportional hazards 
regression. The index day for all of our primary comparisons will be the time of the first 
vaccination. Because patients who fail to proceed to the first vaccina tion because of GBM 
recurrence or for other reasons cannot experience differential effects due to treatment arm 
membership, we will not perform an intent -to-treat analysis that includ es these patients. We will 
perform an intent -to-treat analysis of OS and PFS that includes patients who begin the vaccination 
sequence but who do not receive at least three vaccinations because of recurrence or other reasons. 
OS and PFS times for adequately vaccinated patients  who are  lost to follow -up will be considered 
right -censored at the time of loss and will be included in all of our survival comparisons.  
 
All subjects who receive at least one dose of DC vaccine will be considered evaluable for purposes 
of safety and toxicity.  
 
All subjects who complete  chemoRT  and receive  dose-intense adjuvant TMZ and  at least 3 DC 
vaccines will be considered evaluable for purposes of the primary and secondary endpoints.  
 
ATTAC -II   Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy  
Version: 20241007  Page 96 of 121 
CONFIDENTIAL  The impact of pp65 -LAMP mRNA DC vaccine on PFS and OS in patients with gross total 
resection will also be explored using the log rank test and Kaplan -Meier curves, although our trial 
design may not necessarily achieve sufficient power to detect a clinicall y meaningful effect within 
this patient subgroup.  
 
15.3.2  Secondary Biological Objectives   
We will estimate within -patient changes in immune response (ELISPOT, cytokines array , flow 
cytometric analysis and NK cell activity) from baseline to vaccine #3 and compare these changes 
between treatment and control groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. To assess the effect of 
these changes in immune response on OS and PFS subsequent to vaccine #3, we will conduct a 
landmark analysis within the framework of Cox proportional hazards models of post -baseline OS 
and PFS. These models will incorporate Indica tors for treatment arm, change in immune response 
parameters from baseline to vaccine #3, interaction between treatment arm and immune response 
changes, and potential confounders.

 APPENDICES  
 
18.1 Appendix A : Radiation Therapy  
The total targeted RT dose will be at the discretion of the treating Radiation Oncologist.  Optimally, 
one treatment of 1.8 -2.0 Gy/fraction will be given daily 5 days per week for a total targeted dose 
of 59.4 -60.0 Gy over < 7 weeks.  3D conformal and intensity -modulated RT is permitted.   All 
portals should be treated during each treatment session. Doses are specified as the target dose that 
shall be to the center of the target volume.  
 
The gross target volume (GTV) for both the initial volume (GTV1) and the conedown volume 
(GTV2) should be based on the postoperative CT/MRI (and preferably the MRI; the preoperative 
scans may be used if postoperative scans are not available). This initial target volume (GTV1) 
should include the contrast -enhancing lesion (and should include the surgical resection cavity) and 
surrounding edema (if it exists) demonstrated on CT/MRI plus a 2.0 -cm margin (this 2.0 -cm 
margin -extended volume will be considered the  initial planning target volume, or PTV1). The 
initial target volume will be treated to 46 Gy at 2Gy/fraction or 45 -50.4 Gy at 1.8Gy/fraction. If 
no surrounding edema is present, the initial planning target volume (PTV1) should include the 
contrast -enhancing lesion (and should include the surgical resection cavity) plus a 2.5 -cm margin. 
Please note that clinical judgment may be used to modify PTV 1 to exclude sensitive structures 
such as the optic chiasm, non -cranial contents, or anatomic regions in the brai n where natural 
barriers would likely preclude microscopic tumor extension, such as the cerebellum, the 
contralateral hemisphere, directly across from the tentorium cerebri, the ventricles, etc. After 46 
Gy, the tumor volume (GTV2) for the conedown treatme nt should include the contrast -enhancing 
lesion (without edema) on the pre -surgery CT/MRI scan plus a 1.5 -2-cm margin (PTV2). Treat to 
14 Gy at 2Gy/fraction or 14.4 -9.0 Gy at 1.8Gy/fraction to a total of 60.0 or 59.4Gy, respectively . 
 
Dose is prescribed to the isodose line such that at least 95% of the target volume receives he 
prescribed dose.  
 
The optic apparatus should be limited to a maximum of 54Gy and no more than 5% of the volume 
of the brainstem should receive >54Gy.  
 
Radiation will be delayed or interrupted if the platelet count is < 20,000. Radiation will not begin 
or resume until the platelet count is ≥ 20,000. Hematologic toxicities should be rated on a scale of 
0-5 as defined in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
5.0. 
 
If radiotherapy has to be temporarily interrupted for technical or medical reasons unrelated to the 
temozolomide administration, then treatment with daily temozolomide should continue. If 
radiotherapy has to be permanently interrupted then treatment with d aily temozolomide should 
stop.

CONFIDENTIAL  18.2 Appendix B : Temozolomide Therapy during Radiation  
TMZ should be administered continuously from day 1 of radiotherapy to the last day of radiation 
at a daily oral dose of 75 mg/m2 for a maximum of 49 days. The drug will be administered orally 
1 hour before each session of radiotherapy during weekdays (Monday through Friday).  During 
weekends without radiotherapy (Saturday and Sunday), the drug will be taken in the morning.   
The dose will be determined using the body surface area (BSA) calculated at the beginning of the 
concomitant treatment. The BSA will be calculated from the  height obtained at the pretreatment 
visit and the we ight obtained at the visit immediately before the first day of treatment. Capsules of 
TMZ are available in 5, 20, 100, 140, 180 and 250 mg. The daily dose will be rounded to the 
nearest 5 mg.  Patients will be instructed to swallow the capsules whole, in rapid succession, 
without chewing them. If vomiting occurs during the course of treatment, no re -dosing of the 
patient is allowed before the next scheduled dose. The capsules should be taken on an empty 
stomach, therefore a minimum of 2 hours aft er a meal and with no food ingestion for 1 hour after 
TMZ administration.  Antiemetic prophylaxis is usually not required for the continuous daily 
dosing schedule. However, prophylaxis with a 5 -HT3 antagonist is recommended prior to 
administration of the f irst few TMZ doses and should be administered orally 30 to 60 minutes 
before TMZ treatment.  
 
No dose reduction should be made, but delay or discontinuation of TMZ administration should be 
decided weekly according to hematologic and non -hematologic AEs.  If one or more of the 
following are observed:  
• ANC < 1.0 x 109/ L  
• Platelet count < 75 x 109/L  
• Grade 3 non -hematologic AE (except for alopecia, nausea and vomiting if controlled by 
maximal antiemetic therapy, and fatigue  if controlled by pharmacologic or non -
pharmacologic therapy ) 
then treatment with concomitant TMZ will be withheld until all of the following conditions are 
met: 
• ANC ≥ 1.0 x 109/L  
• Platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L  
• Grade ≤ 1 non -hematologic AE (except for alopecia, nausea and vomiting if controlled by 
maximal antiemetic therapy, and fatigue if controlled by pharmacologic or non -
pharmacologic therapy)  
 
In case of hematologic AE as defined above, a CBC should be performed at least twice weekly. In 
case of non -hematologic AE, the patient should be assessed at least weekly with relevant 
laboratory test(s). As soon as all of the above conditions are met, the  administration of TMZ will 
resume at the same dose as used initially.  
If one or more of the following are observed:  
• ANC < 0.5 x 109/L (Grade 4)  
• Platelet count < 10 x 109/L (Grade 4)  
• Grade 3 or 4 non -hematologic AE (except for alopecia, nausea and vomiting if controlled 
by maximal antiemetic therapy, and fatigue if controlled by pharmacologic or non -
pharmacologic therapy)  
then treatment with concomitant TMZ should be stopped .

TMZ will be administered orally once per day for 21 consecutive days (days 1 -21) of a 35 (+/ - 7) 
day cycle. The starting dose for the first cycle will be 75 mg/m2/day, with a single dose escalation 
to 100 mg/m2/day in subsequent cycles if no adverse events > grade 2 are noted.  
 
Twelve cycles of TMZ may be given if the patient demonstrates continued improvement on MR 
scan, decreased corticosteroid requirement, improvement in performance status, or improvement 
in neurologic function.  
 
Dosing Modifications  
Dosing is based on adverse events (AEs) during the prior treatment cycle. If multiple AEs are seen, 
the dose administered should be based on the dose reduction required for the most severe grade of 
any single AE as shown in Table 2.

First cycle  
TMZ will be started at a dose of 75 mg/m2/day.  
 
Second cycle  
The dose of TMZ will be determined according to (1) non -hematologic AE during the preceding 
treatment cycle, as well as (2) the nadir (lowest/worst) ANC and platelet counts.  
 
Cycles 3 -12 
Any dose reductions of TMZ will be determined according to (1) non -hematologic AE during the 
preceding cycle, as well as (2) the nadir (lowest/worst) ANC and platelet counts.  No dose 
escalation should be attempted. The same dose reductions as for the second cycle should be 
applied.  If the dose was reduced or delayed for adverse events, there will be no dose escalation.  
 
Delay  
On day 1 of each cycle (within the prior 72 hours), ANC ≥ 1 x 10/L, platelet count ≥ 100 x 10/L 
and all grade 3 or 4 non -hematologic AEs (except for alopecia, nausea, and vomiting  if controlled 
by maximal antiemetic therapy ) must have resolved (to grade ≤ 1).  
 
If AEs persists, treatment should be delayed by 1 week for up to 4 consecutive weeks. If, after 4 
weeks of delay, all AEs have still not resolved: then any further adjuvant treatment with TMZ 
should be stopped.

CONFIDENTIAL  Dose escalation  
If, during the first cycle, all non -hematologic AEs observed were grade ≤ 2 (except for alopecia, 
nausea and vomiting  if controlled by maximal antiemetic therapy ) and with platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L 
and ANC ≥ 1 x109/L: then the TMZ dose should be escalated to dose level +1 and this dose should 
be used as the maintenance  dose for subsequent cycles. If treatment after cycle 1 has to be delayed 
by any length of time because of ongoing hematologic AEs >2 and/or non-hematologic AEs of 
grade > 2 (except for alopecia , nausea and vomiting if controlled by maximal antiemetic therapy) , 
then no escalation is possible.   If the dose was not escalated at cycle 2, then the dose should not be 
escalated in further cycles (3 -12).  
 
Dose reductions  
If any non -hematologic AE observed was grade > 2 (except for alopecia, nausea and vomiting  if 
controlled by maximal antiemetic therapy ) and/or if platelets < 100 x 109/L and/or ANC < 1 x 
109/L, then the dose should be reduced by one dose level.  For patients who would require dose 
reductions to a dose level < 35 mg/m2/day (dose level -2), TMZ will be stopped.   Also, if any of 
the same non -hematologic grade 3 AE recurs (except for alopecia, nausea and vomiting  if 
controlled by maximal antiemetic therapy ) after reduction for that AE, then TMZ will be stopped.   
If any treatment -related non -hematologic AE observed was grade 4 (except for alopecia, nausea 
and vomiting  if controlled by maximal antiemetic therapy ) then adjuvant TMZ treatment should 
be stopped.  Please see Tables 3 -6 for a summary of dose modification or discontinuation.  
 
The reason(s) for dose reduction and/or delay must be documented in the CRF.

If dose -intensified TMZ is delayed for more than 4 weeks or stopped due to any hematologic or 
non-hematologic AEs that were not grade 4, and less than 6 cycles of TMZ have been achieved, 
once the AEs have resolved to ≤ grade 1 but not more than 8 weeks aft er the previous dose -
intensified TMZ cycle, TMZ can be restarted at the standard Stupp protocol dosing schedule at 
150mg/m2 orally daily for 5 days on a 28+/ -14 days cycle to achieve a maximal total of 12 cycles

or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not post -menopausal.  
Post-menopause is defined as:  
- Amenorrhea that has lasted for ≥ 12 consecutive months without another cause, or  
 
For the purposes of the proposed study, medically acceptable forms of contraceptive methods  
include the following:  
 
• Surgical sterilization at least 6 months before Study Drug administration  
• Implants  
• Levonorgestrel (LNG) and Copper T IUDs  
• Sexual abstinence  
• Injectable hormone depos  
• Oral contraceptive pill  
• Hormone patch  
• Vaginal ring  
• Condom  
 
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) and 
withdrawal are NOT acceptable methods of contraception.

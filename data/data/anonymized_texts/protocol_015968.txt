11 Statistical  
Considerations  The primary endpoint will be evaluated in both the AFX and proximally fixated device 
groups.   The relative performance of the two groups will be evaluated through one -
sided tests for non- inferiority and superiority.  Combining the superiority and non -
infer iority trials into a single closed testing procedure allows for maintenance of a 
controlled Type 1 error rate.    An 8% margin will be used for the non- inferiority test.   If 
the non- inferiority null hypothesis is rejected, the null hypothesis for superiorit y will 
be investigated.     
Hypotheses for Non- Inferiority: 
Null Hypothesis:            𝐻𝐻10:𝜇𝜇𝐴𝐴−𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵≤−8%  (AFX is inferior with respect to the 
primary endpoint)  
Alternative:                    𝐻𝐻11:𝜇𝜇𝐴𝐴−𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵>−8% (Statistical evidence of non -
inferiority)  
 
Hypotheses for Superiority:  
Null Hypothesis:   𝐻𝐻 20:𝜇𝜇𝐴𝐴−𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵≤0 (The two device groups have equal effect)  
Alternative:       𝐻𝐻21:𝜇𝜇𝐴𝐴−𝜇𝜇𝐵𝐵>0 (Statistical evidence of superiority)  
 
The original trial size was selected to provide 80% power for the superiority test.  The 
original  sample size required , for non -inferiority testing , is relatively smaller; thus, 
the power of the non -inferiority test approaches 100%  with the revised sample size . 
Suggested  
Schedule of 
Tests  Patient eligibility will be assessed by the Investigator per institutional standard of care 
pre-procedural imaging. Blood work and physical exam will also be collected as per 
routine  schedule at each institution.  
Following Institutional R eview board approval and patient written informed consent, 
the patient will be screened for eligibility. Subjects will be followed procedurally and 
to hospital discharge and per institutional standard of care thereafter through to 5 years (total follow -up commitment).

12 4 TRIAL OVERVIEW  
4.1 OBJECTIVE  
The objective of this post -market trial is to evaluate Endologix AFX endovascular AAA system 
with anatomical  fixation against other approved Endovascular systems with proximal  fixation.  
Multiple U.S clinical centers will be involved in the trial to includ e a broad range of experience.  
Imaging data will be evaluated by an independent Core L ab. 
4.2 BACKGROUND  
Since the pioneering work of Dr. Parodi and Dr. Volodos  in the late 1980s and early 1990s , 
there have been few pivotal moments in the history of endovascular repair of AAA (EVAR).  
The EVAR -1/2, DREAM, OVER and ACE trials have demonstrated early  benefits of EVAR 
over open surgical repair but each of these studies included patients with prior ge neration 
endografts; many of which are rarely or never implanted today. The gradual evolution of EVAR 
practices has since expanded the use of the technique in a growing number of aortic  anatomies 
outside the boundaries tested in clinical trials. Such pract ices have recently been questioned, 
reversing in some instances the utilization of EVAR as the technique of choice in AAA repair.  
Unfortunately, current evidence on so- called “hostile” v ersus “friendly” anatomies is limited to 
the retrospective analyses o f the single -center cohorts treated with multiple generations of 
devices. In the age of increasing patient awareness and fiscal scrutiny over therapeutic 
outcomes, new prospective data on EVAR outcomes in the contemporary patie nt populations is 
long overdue.  
The evolution of EVAR technology has led to two distinct device concepts currently available in clinical practice. One concept incorporates the bifurcated component positioned high in the 
aneurysm sac and tubular limb components extended distally into i liac arteries. Such endograft 
systems rely on penetrating hooks and barbs for proximal fixation within the aorta. The majority 
of device manufacturers adopted this concept, producing devices with different proximal stent configurations (suprarenal versus infrarenal), stent designs, and graft materials. The alternative 
concept, developed by Endologix, relies on the bifurcated endograft component positioned directly on the native aortic bifurcation, with the proximal component extending cranially into 
the aor tic neck. Fixation of the endograft on the aortic bifurcation (anatomic fixation) and the 
associated freedom to optimize the proximal configuration without constraints of the fixation 
elements, results in a system that most closely resembles the anatomy of  the native aorta and 
the seal zones extended by the pressure of the native blood flow (ActiveSeal™), with potential advantages of optimized hemodynamics, migration resistance, and aneurysm exclusion.  
The purpose of the LEOPARD trial is to evaluate the out comes of contemporary EVAR in a 
real-world population using two distinct endograft concepts ( proximal  versus  anatomic 
fixation). The multicenter, Level 1 randomized evidence generated by LEOPARD will serve as 
modern reference for future therapy development s, the way earlier trials serve that purpose 
today. In addition, the LEOPARD trial will provide insight into the performance of the device 
design in a broad range of patient anatomies, guidance on EVAR strategy and clinical 
presentations, leading to the definitive choices in the years to come.

13 4.3 INITIAL  TRIAL  GOVERNANCE  
The initial governance of the trial will be provided by a Steering Committee  (SC)  comprised of 
physicians  experienced in EVAR and considered thought leaders in the field. The purpose of 
the Steering Committee  is to provide scientific direction and oversight to the  start-up of the  
LEOPARD Trial involving Endologix’s EVAR System, AFX. Essential responsibilities of the 
SC incl ude trial design and protocol review and to provide guidance and advice to the 
Investigators for patient selection and  timely enrollment.  
Details of the SC are available in the Steering Committee Charter and are kept on file.   
4.4 TRIAL DEVICE  
The devices used in this trial are endovascular stent grafts approved by the FDA to treat 
abdominal aortic aneurysms. All devices are commercially available in the U.S. and, for the 
purposes of this trial , include the  latest iteration of the following devices:  
1. Endologix AFX® System  (Test device)  
2. Cook Zenith® System  (Comparator  device)  
3. Gore Excluder System  (Comparator  device)  
4. Medtronic Endurant System  (Comparator  device)  
The description, specifications and indications/instructions for use may be found in their respective In structions for Use. It is noted the AFX
® System is anatomically fixated distally 
while the remaining three devices are fixated proximally within the aorta using penetrating 
barbs or hooks.  
This trial will allow for use of iterative changes to all devices indicated above.  
4.5 TRIAL DESIGN  
The LEOPARD trial is a prospective, randomized, multi -center trial, intended to evaluate the 
outcomes of contemporary EVAR (Endovascular Aneurysm Repair) in a real -world population.  
The trial is designed to compare the anatomically stabilized AFX Endograft System to a 
reference group of proximally fixated EVAR  devices. Patients will be ran domized between the 
two groups.  
Randomization will be 1:1. Each I nvestigator will select one comparator device of their choice 
before enrolling the first patient  and this device will serve as the comparator device for that 
Investigator throughout the course of enrollment . The trial will sequentially evaluate non-
inferiority and superiority hypotheses.

Figure 1: Randomization Scheme  
 
All subjects undergoing EVA R with either the AFX System or the reference group of other 
EVAR devices will be followed procedurally to discharge, at 1, 6  (standard of care follow -up, 
no specific trial visit is  require d), 12 months and annually through to 5 years (total follow -up 
commitment).  
After this protocol and the patient I nformed Consent Form (ICF)  are reviewed and approved 
by the local Institutional Review Board ( IRB), potential subjects having infrarenal AAA will 
be offered participation in the trial . This will be accomplished through the patient’s reading 
of the informed consent form and discussion of the trial with the patient by the Investigator  
and site personnel. Agreement to participate an d to attend all protocol required  follow -up visit s 
will be documented with the patient’s signature on the informed consent form.  
4.6 ENROLLMENT CLOSE  
Total enrollment for the trial is up to 800 patients. When the sponsor has been notified that the 
necessary number of patients has been enrolled, the sites will be notified to discontinue 
enrollment. However, all consented patients will still be allowed to receive the treatment for their trial arm. This may result in a small number of additional patients in the trial. All such 
patients will be included in trial analysis.  
5 TRIAL  POPULATION AND PROCEDURES  
Up to 80 sites with experience in EVAR and up to 800 subjects will participate in this trial. Each 
participating Investigator will be required to be certified on both the AFX system and their choice 
of comparator  device. Any Investigator wishing to employ percutaneous endovascular repair 
(PEVAR) must also p rovide documentation of certification on the procedure using the particular 
device. Following completion of the ICF , the Investigator  will commence patient screening and 
enrollment . Certification must be completed in accordance with each manufacturer’s  certification 
process.

5.3 PATIENT ASSESSMENT AND SCREENING  
Patients will be consecutively assessed for inclusion in the trial by the Investigator according to 
standard of care. A log of all these assessments will be maintained . This will include information 
on any patients deemed unable to participate and the reasons for such.  
5.4 ENROLLMENT CRITER IA 
Patients who fulfill all eligibility criteria and sign the ICF will be considered as a trial candidate. 
The r andomization process will be i nitiated to determine the primary trial device for each trial  
candidate. A trial candidate  is considered an enrolled  subject  in the trial only upon the insertion 
of the delivery system for the associated primary trial device . Any other adjective procedures 
before insertion of the delivery system for the primary device will be captured  for all trial 
candidates.  
5.5 PATIENT INFORMED CONSENT  
Written informed consent , documented on the ICF  in accordance with Good Clinical Practice 
standards and trial  center regulations, shall be obtained from each patient. The Investigator  will 
retain a copy of the signed informed consent document in each patient’s record and provide a 
copy to the patient. There is no incremental risk and data will be collected anonym ously.  
5.6 ENROLLMENT AND RANDOMIZATION  
Patient enrollment into this trial  is based on the site evaluation of patient conformance with the 
protocol -specified selection criteria (see §5.1) , and the Investigator’s  assessment of suitability 
for treatment with either the AFX- System  or the comparator device.  Blood work and physical 
exam will also be collected as per standard of care at each institution.

16 Once consented and assessed for inclusion in the tr ial, the Investigator will el ect to randomize 
the patient by entering required information into the EDC. Upon entering this information,  the 
patient will be randomized to receive the AFX® System or the comparator device. The 
randomization result will be generated and accessible to the site prior  to the scheduled procedure 
date.  
Enrollment in the trial  only occurs upon advancement of the trial  device into the subject’s 
vasculature.   
5.7 IMPLANTATION PROCEDURE  
The EVAR  procedure is  performed according to the  device IFU to which the patient has been 
randomized and the institutional standard of care. Patient sedation , vascular access and 
procedural techniques  will be handled at the discretion of the Investigator .  
5.8 FOLLOW -UP REQUIREMENTS  
Subjects will be followed procedurally and to hospital discharge and at 1, 6  (standard of care 
follow -up; no specific trial visit is required ), 12 months and annually through five years (total 
follow -up commitment).   
Table 2 outlines a  suggested follow -up schedule which may be altered to meet standard of care 
at individual sites.  
If a subject undergoes conversion to open surgical repair, the subject will continue follow -up 
for 30- days post -conversion, at which point the subject will exit. If the subject has not been 
discharged from the conversion hospitalization within 30- days, the date of discharge will be the 
date of trial  exit.

failure results in a serious complication, or residual Type I and Type III E ndoleaks which occur 
and cannot be resolved during the index procedure.  
 
8 ELECTRONIC CASE REPORT FORMS  
The trial will utilize an e lectronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ) system for data collection. All site 
staff will be trained on correct eCRF completion prior to site activation . Only trained personnel 
will receive access and be able to enter data in the eCRF. All eCRF pages will be electronically 
signed by the I nvestigator at each site. Each subject will be anonymized and given a specific trial 
number in the eCRF.  
 
9 DATA MANAGEMENT  
The data required for the trial will be entered by the investigation sites into eCRF. Detailed edit 
checks will ensure a high -quality standard of the data entered in the database. Additionally, data 
management will review the collected data and issue possi ble queries. Queries should be resolved 
by the investigation site on an ongoing basis. When all trial data is complete, the database will be 
locked, and data analyzed.

19 10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Primary analyses will be based on modified Intention -to-Treat (mITT)  populations. An 
Intent ion-to-Treat (ITT) analysis population consists of all randomized subjects. While the 
intent of the trial is to implant all randomized subjects, some randomized subjects will not 
undergo implantation  due to unforeseen issues. If this were to occur in a substantial number of 
subjects, it is possible that the results may be biased towards non -inferiority as the groups would 
become increasingly similar. Thus , a mITT population is defined, which consists of all 
randomized subjects that subsequently underwent EVAR. All endpoints in this trial , unless 
otherwise specifically noted, will be evaluated against the mITT analysis population. 
Randomization will be centralized using permuted block design. A randomization schedule will 
be generated with a random number generator in the SAS System®.  Sites/I nvestigators will be 
blinded to block size.  Due to the use of a large number of sites with  a relatively small number 
of patients within specific sites, stratification by institution will not be performed. The intent is 
to allocate similar numbers of subjects between the two treatment groups across the total number 
of sites, to provide maximum power. Additionally, s tratification using risk factors will not be 
performed.  
Additional information is available in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  Statistical analyses 
will be performed using SAS System®, Version 9.4 or later.   
For additional information on the randomization process, refer to §5.6.  
10.2 STATISTICAL METHODS  
All non-imaging -driven variables  in the composite endpoint will be evaluated to 1 year (day 
365 post -implant), whereas imaging- driven variables will be evaluated to a 1- year window (day 
365 +/ - 60 days). The day of implantation will be set as day 0.  Early events are defined as those 
occurring from the date of the procedure up to 30 calendar days post -operatively. Late events 
are defined as those occurring from after 30 calendar days post -operatively (from day 31 
forward).  
The null hypotheses for both non- inferiority and superiority will be evaluated with one- sided 
alpha level s of 0.05.  
If the non- inferiority null hypothesis is rejected, the null hypothesis for superiority will be 
investigated.  
Hypotheses for Non -Inferiority:  
Null Hypothesis:           H10:μA−μB≤−8% (AFX is inferior with respect to the primary 
endpoint)  
Alternative:                   H11:μA−μB>−8% (Statistical evidence of non -inferiority)

20 Hypotheses for Superiority:  
Null Hypothesis:        H2 0:μA−μB≤0 (The two device groups have equal effect)  
Alternative:                  H21:μA−μB>0 (Statistical evidence of superiority)  
Data for the primary endpoint will be presented as point estimates for both the treatment (AFX 
device) and control (proximally fixated devices), along with a 95% confidence int erval for the 
difference.  The lower bound of a one sided 95% confidence interval is used to evaluate the non-inferiority and superiority null hypotheses.  
 
Quantitative parameters will be described using the following summary descriptive statistics: 
numbe r of non- missing values, mean, standard deviation, median, first and third quartiles, and 
minimum and maximum values.  
 
Qualitative parameters will be described overall using frequencies and percentages. 
Percentages will be calculated on the number of non- missing observations.  In all cases, the 
number of missing values will be specified.  
 
Kaplan -Meier estimates will be generated for the composite endpoint components across the 
duration of the trial . 
 
Sample Size Determination:  
Given an alpha error rate of 0.05, a desired power of 90%, and assuming a success rate (in terms of the primary endpoint) of 86% for AFX with a n 8% advantage over the control 
group, the sample size required to demonstrate non- inferiority is 154 subjects in total.  In 
order to have enough power to evaluate all hypotheses the sample size for this trial was 
driven by the evaluation of superiority.  In this case, an alpha error rate of 0.05, power of 80%, success rate of 86% for AFX, and a relative 8% advantage in AFX’s favor requires 566 patients.  A  7% advantage in AFX’s favor requires 724 patients. An approximate drop-
out rate of 10%/1- year indicates 804 patients should be enrolled to provide 724 patients at 1 
year.   The original protocol thus called for enrollment of up to 800 subjects. The enrollment 
was completed  at 455 subjects after an unplanned analysis supported that the superiority 
evaluation was futile. With a total of 455 subjects enrolled, 410 are assumed to reach the 1 -
year endpoint after 10% dropout. This sample size results in 99% power for the non-
inferiority test under original assumptions, and thus the trial is considered adequately 
powered for evaluating non -inferiority. The sample size has been determined with PASS 
version 12.0.2.

ISTRIBUTION OF THE PATIENTS

21 10.2.2  HANDLING MISSING VALUES  
In order to provide unbiased and informative findings, no replacement of missing values is 
planned for any parameters. In all applicable cases, reported analysis will mention the number 
of missing values for each outcome in the m ITT population.  
10.2.3  DATA  ANALYS IS 
In the original analyses, the ARC endpoint has been evaluated  by site reported events only.  
Now that  Corelab data is available,  it will be considered during the future evaluation s of the 
data.  
In future analyses, the data presented will utilize CoreLa b findings in addition to site -reported 
findings.  The analyses will defer to CoreLab  results when the site and CoreLab  disagree. In 
the absence of CoreLab -reviewed data, events will be assessed by the site. In addition to this, 
the clinical data and evalua tion of the patients will be considered when reviewing data, and 
the clinical history of the patient as well as the review of the independent adjudicator m ay 
overrule site and Corelab findings.  
 
11  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
The safety of the device will be monitor ed throughout the trial by assessment of serious adverse 
events (SAE), adverse device effects (ADE) serious adverse device effects (SADE ), and major 
adverse events (MAE) , or events that may potentially meet a n endpoint . All SAE s will be 
recorded  in the eCRF system and will be assessed by the Sponsor . Additionally, applicable events 
will be assessed by   the internal Complaint Handling Department in order to comply with adverse 
event  reporting. Non-serious adverse events with no device relationship that do not meet a trial 
endpoint, will not  be evaluated in this trial ( definition according to ISO 14155:2011(E)).  
 
Independent  adjudication will occur for  all ADEs , MAEs and SADEs reported by the sites within 
this trial. For any adjudicated events, the adjudicator  or designee  will be required to complete the 
eCRF data capture form.  
11.1 ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS1 
11.1.1  UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECT (UADE)  
UADE  is any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or 
death caused by or associated with a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity or degree of incidence. Additionally, an unanticipated adverse 
event includes any other unanticipat ed serious problem associated with a device that relates 
to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects ( US 21 CFR 812.3).

12 DEFINITIONS  
12.1 DEFINITIONS  ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPOSITE PRIMARY ENDPOINT ARC  
  
The primary trial endpoint is an assessment at one year, where survival is in the absence of 
Aneurysm Related Complications (ARC). ARC is a composite of the most relevant EVAR 
related outcomes and include:  
• Aneurysm Rupture : bleeding or leaking of blood from the aneurysm subsequent to the 
index procedure.  
• Conversion to Open Surgical Repair (OSR) : open surgical repair of the abdominal 
aortic aneurysm due to unsuccessful delivery or deployment of the stent graft, due to complications or other clinical situations that precluded  successful endovascular 
treatment, or at any time following initial successful endovascular treatment for any reason. Excludes post -mortem explant of the trial device.  
• Endoleaks : clear evidence of contrast within the aneurysm sac  
- Endoleak Type I a – C ontrast material in the aneurysm sac adjacent to the 
proximal seal zone and/or between the endograft and the inner wall of the proximal attachment site.  
- Endoleak Type I b – Contrast material in the aneurysm sac adjacent to the 
distal seal zone and/or between the endograft and the inner wall of the distal 
attachment site.  
- Endoleak Type II  – Contrast material along the posterior sac wall with 
visualization of lumbar artery or the inferior mesenteric artery

28 16 MONITOR ING  
The eCRF will not  be considered as source document.  Source data verification will be performed 
by means of intermittent on- site and/or off -site monitoring. Details will be outlined in the 
monitoring plan  (CMP). Considering the COVID -19 public health em ergency, the monitoring 
plan has been updated accordingly to include changes to the original plan that could become 
necessary due to the extraordinary situation. The Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical products 
During the COVID -19 Public Health Emergency : Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and 
Institutional  Review Boards  has been reviewed and used to identify and outline the most suitable 
changes.  
16.1 PROTOCOL  DEVIATION 
 
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, International 
Conference on Harmonization, or  Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) requirements. The 
noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site 
staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the site and 
implemented promptly.   
 
These practices are consistent with ICH GCP:  
 
• 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, Sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2 and 4.5.3  
• 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control , Section 5.1.1 
• 5.20 Noncompliance , Sections 5.20.1 and 5.20.2  
 
It is the responsibility of the site investigator to use continuous vigilance to identify and report deviations within 5 working days of identification of the protocol deviation, or within 5 working 
days of the scheduled protocol -required activity.  All deviations must be addressed in study 
source documents.  Protocol deviations must be sent to the reviewing Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) per their policies. The site investigator is responsible for knowing and adhering to 
the reviewing IRB requir ements.  Considering the COVID -19 public health emergency, the 
monitoring plan has been updated accordingly to include changes to the identification of protocol deviations related to delayed or missed follow -up visits as well as delayed or missed 
images.  
17 TRIAL  TERMINATION 
The trial can be terminated or suspended prematurely at a specific investigation site or in total

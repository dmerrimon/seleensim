Protocol Title: A Phase 2 study of Lisocabtagene Maraleucel (JCAR017) as Second -Line Therapy in A dult 
Patients with Aggressive B -cell NHL ( TRANSCEND -PILO T-017006 )
Sponsor: Juno Therapeutics, Inc. , a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene Corporation
Study Rationale: 
Outcomes are poor and additional options are needed for patients w ho have failed front -line therapy and are not 
eligible for hematopo ietic stem cell transplantation (HS CT). Data from Juno Study 017001 demonstrate that 
treatment with JCAR017 in subjects with aggressive B -cell non -Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who have failed 2 or 
more lines of therapy results in encouraging efficacy outcomes and has an acceptable safety profile. The purpose 
of this study is to evaluate the use of JCAR017 in subjects who have failed one previous line of therapy for 
aggressive B -cell NHL and are not eligible for HSCT . 
Study Objectives:
Primary:
To assess the antitumor activity ( overall response rate, ORR ) ofJCAR017 in adult subjects with aggressive 
B-cell NHL who are ineligible for HSCT
Secondary:
To evaluate the safety of JCAR017
To assess the complete response (CR) rate and durability of antitumor activity of JCAR017
To estimate the progressi on-free survival (PFS) , event -free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) of 
subjects treated with JCAR017
To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of JCAR017 in this subject population 
To assess health -related quality of life (HRQoL) and healt h economics and outcomes research (HEOR) 
Exploratory:
To assess immune responses to JCAR017
To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of JCAR017
To assess CAR T subset expansion and persistence
To assess the effect of JCAR017 attributes on safety, PK, and antitumor activity
To assess the effect of tumor and tumor microenvironment on JCAR017 PK and clinical response
Study Design:
This is an open -label, multicenter, Phase 2 study to determine the antitumor activity, PK, and safety of JCAR017
in subjects who have relapsed from, or are refractory to, a single line of immunochemotherapy for aggressive B -
cell NHL and are ineligible for HSCT (as defined in the eligibility criteria ). Subjects will be treated with 
lymphodep leting chemotherapy and JCAR017 .
Upon enro llment, subjects will undergo leukapheresis to enable JCAR017 product generation. A baseline tumor 
biopsy ( either a histo rical sample, or if not available, a fresh tumor sample )will be obtained. While JCAR017 is 
being manufactured, if required to control disease, subjects may receive salvage low -dose chemotherapy or one 
cycle of non -curative standard of care antitumor therapy.
Upon successful JCAR017 product generation, subjects will enter the treatment phase.  Treatment includes 
lymphodepleting chemothera py with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (flu/cy) followed by JCAR017 at a dose 
of 100×106CAR+ T cells administered intravenously (IV) 2 to 7 days after completion of lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy.  
I
f a subject has achieved a CR to JCAR017 and subsequent ly progressed, they may receive retreatment only if 
doses are available and remanufacturing is not required . Details regarding retreatment are provided in the 
protocol.

After treatment with JCAR017 , subjects will enter post -treatment follow -up, and will be followed on this study 
for 2 years for safety, PK and biomarkers, disease status, HRQoL, and survival, as described in more detail in the 
assessments sections below.  Assessments for long -term saf ety, overall survival, and HRQoL will continue even 
after disease progression.  After completion of 2 years of assessments in this protocol, long -term follow -up 
(LTFU) for survival, long -term toxicity, and viral vector safety will continue under a separate protocol for up to 
15 years after JCAR017 treatment .
Toxicity will be evaluated on an ongoing basis by the Sponsor and reviewed at regularly scheduled Investigator 
Safety calls.  Additionally, safety monitoring boundaries based on the incidence of Grade 3 or above, JCAR017 -
related, treatment -emergent neurological toxicity and prolonged Grade 4 and Grade 5 individual safety events 
will be established using a Bayesian framework as described in “Safety Assessments,” below.

7.Histological confirmation of diagnosis at last relapse. Enough tumor material must be available for central 
confirmatio n of diagnosis, otherwise a new tumor biopsy is mandated. NOTE: if subsequen t therapies are 
given after last relapse with SD/PD as best response, the tissue from that last relapse will be considered 
adequate to participate in the trial.
8.ECOG performance status of 0 , 1, or 2
9.Adequate vascular access for leukapheresis procedure (eit her peripheral line or surgically -placed line)
10.Females of childbearing potential (FCBP*) subjects must:
a.Either commit to true abstinence** from heterosexual contact (which must be reviewed on a monthly

lymphodepleting chemotherapy. 
c.There are insufficient exposure data to provide any recommendation concerning the duration of 
contraception and the abstaining from breastfeeding following treatment with JCAR017. Any decision 
regarding contraception and breastfeeding after JCAR017 infusion should be discussed with the treating 
physician.
Note: Highly effective methods are defined as those that result in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per 
year) when u sed consistently and correctly. The following are examples of highly effective and 
additional effective methods of contraception:
Intrauterine device (IUD)
Hormonal (birth control pill, injections, implants)

point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 3) has not been naturally 
postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 
12 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).
** True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. In 
contrast, periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.
13.Subjects must agree to not donate blood, organs, sperm or semen, and egg cells for usage in other individuals 
for at least 1 year following lymphodepletion chemotherapy. There are insufficient exposure da ta to provide

15.Venous thrombosis or embolism not managed on a stable regimen of anticoagulation
Investigational Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration:
TheJCAR017 investigational drug product is comprised of autologous CD8+ and CD4+ T cells that express a 
CD19 -specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that are provided as frozen cell suspensions for IV 
administration.  The JCAR017 investigational drug product is provided as 2 individually formulated CD8+ and 
CD4+ T cell suspensions in media containing dimeth yl sulfoxide (DMSO) for direct IV administration in equal 
CAR T -cell quantities into the subject. 
JCAR017 at a dose of 1 00×106CAR+ T cells (5 0×106CD8+ CAR+ T cells and 5 0×106CD4+ CAR+ T cells), 
will be given IV in a single -dose schedule on Day 1 (between 2 and 7 days following the completion of 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy) of a 28 -day cycle.  If a subject has achieved a CR to JCAR017 and subsequently 
progressed , they  may  receive retreatment only if doses are available and remanufacturing is not required .
Duration of Study and Subject Participation:
The duration of study for each subject is approximately 2 years, and the estimated total time from first subject 
first visit for all subjects to complete the study is approximately 4years . 
Efficacy Assessments:
Treatment response will be assessed at approximately Day 29 and Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24. Assessment 
will occur via radiographic tumor evaluation by diagnostic qu ality CT scans (chest, neck, abdomen, and pelvis) 
and PET scans. Assessment of bone marrow involvement by lymphoma will be by PET scan only; bone marrow 
aspirates and biopsies will not be required for assessment of disease response. Disease response will be 
determined according to the “Recommendations for Initial Evaluation, Staging, and Response Assessment of 
Hodgkin and Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma: The Lugano Classification,” as well as other pertinent clinical data as 
appropriate. For subjects with suspected or confirmed CNS involvement, repeat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
assessments by flow cytometr y will be performed. 
Safety Assessments: 
AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities (type, frequency, and severity) will be collected.  AESIs may include but 
are not limited to infusion reaction, prolonged cytopenia, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurological toxicity, 
macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) , Grade ≥ 3 infection, 
hypogammaglobulinemia, autoimmune disorder, and se cond primary malignanc y.  Safety monitoring boundaries 
based on the incidence of Grade 3 or above, JCAR017 -related, treatment -emergent neurological toxicity and 
prolonged Grade 4 and Grade 5 individual safety events will be established using a Bayesian fra mework to help 
detect safety s ignals during the study.  If the safety boundaries are crossed, enrollment will be paused and an ad 
hoc DSMB meeting will be held to review the data.  Enrollment will remain paused pending the DSMB’s 
recommendations.
Pharmaco kinetic and Biomarker Assessments :
Samples will be taken for PK and biomarker assessments at specified time points throughout the study.  A tumor 
biopsy (in subjects with accessible disease) w ill be obtained pretreatment, anytime from Day 8 to 17 , and at 
disease progression .Collection of tissue from latest archived tumor biopsy (block or slides) will be collected. If

archival sample is before most recent relapse, a new tumor biopsy is mandated to confirm diagnosis for subjects 
with accessible disease.
Asse ssment of JCAR017 PK will be determined by quantitative PCR ( qPCR )to detect the JCAR017 transgene .
Flow cytometry analy sis will be performed as an exploratory endpoint to characterize the expansion and 
persistence ofCD4+ and CD8+ CAR T cell subsets .
Immune responses to JCAR017 will be assessed. 
Biomarke r assessments will include profiling of CAR and endogenous T cells from blood, tumo r and tumor 
microenvironment characterization, enumeration of immune cell subsets, and assessment of cytokines and 
chemokines associated with CRS , neurological toxicity, and immune cell function.  Peripheral blood and 
lymphoma biopsies will be collected for these evaluations, as well as bone marrow biopsy/aspirate and CSF 
samples if clinically indicated .
HRQoL and HEOR A ssessments :
Quality-of-life outcomes will be assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatmen t of Cancer 
(EORTC) QLQ -C30, the FACT -Lym subscale, and the EuroQol instrument EQ -5D-5L, which will be collected at 
specified time points throug hout the study. Information on hospitalizations will be collected throughout the study 
and used to assess health economics and outcomes. 
Statistical Methods:
AEs/SAEs, AESIs, laboratory abnormalities, and PK information will be described and summarized based on the 
JCAR017 -treated Analysis Set .  Results will be presented using descriptive statistics.
Efficacy information will be summarized. Aprimary  efficacy analys isof ORR will be based on the JCAR017-
treated Efficacy Analysis Set using IRC assessment s of disease status. Th isprimary efficacy analysis will test the 
null hy pothesis of ORR ≤p0% against the alternative hypothesis that the ORR >p0% at a 1 -sided 0.025 level of 
significance.  A retrospective patient -level real -world cohort is being planned to generate a comparable 
external/synthetic control, which will be used to provide a null hypothesis p0 %for testing the primary endpoint 
of ORR. The final analyses will be carried out after all subjects have completed or discontinued the study due to 
anyreason. No formal hypothesis testing will be performed at the final analysis.
Justification for Sample Size: 
A sample size of approximate ly62subjects in the JCAR017 -treated Efficacy Analysis Set provides at least 85% 
power to reject the null hypothesi s ofoverall response rate less than 5
0% assuming the target response rate of 
70% using an exact binomial test with 1 -sided significance level 0.025. The assumption of the null hy pothesis of 
50% ORR used to size the study is supported by the results of a meta -analysis of available literature across 12 
studies of subjects receiving second -line treatment. EAST v6.4.1 is used to calculate the sample size and power.

1.1. B
-cell Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma
It is estimated that approximately 72,000 new cases of non- Hodgkin lympho ma (NHL) will be 
diagnosed and approximately  20,000 pati ents will  die of their disease in the United States in 
2019 ( Siegel 2019 ). NHL is the seventh most commo n cancer in the US, accounting for 4. 2% of 
new cancers and 3. 3% of all cancer -related deaths (SEER 2019 ).In the US, about 80 to 85% of 
NHL cases are categorized as B -cell lymphom as and 15 to 20% are categorized as T/natural 
killer (NK) -cell lymphomas (NCCN 2019 ). The most commo n types of  aggressive B- cell NHL 
are diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and mant le cell lympho ma (MCL). With current 
treatm ents, rel apsed or refractory  (R/R) aggre ssive B -cell NHL has poor outcomes, and the 
efficacy  of salvage opti ons are diminished in the era of rituximab -containing regimens (Wilson 
2013) . As such, there remains a need to develop new therapies for R/R B -cell NHL.
Historically, fi rst-line treatment for patients with high -stage aggressive B -cell NHL, including 
DLBCL, primary mediast inal B -cell lymphom a (PMBCL ), and follicular lympho ma Grade 3B , 
has been six or eight cy cles of rituximab wit h cyclophosphamide, doxorubi cin, vincrist ine,and 
prednisone (R -CHOP), with reduced
-intensity dosing regimens recommended for the infirm or 
very elderly populati on > 80 years of age (NCCN 2019 ).  Recent ly, data have been reported that 
support more intens ive therapy  for PMBCL in the upfront setting (NCCN 2019 ), and ongoing 
studi es are evaluat ing augmented R -CHOP regimens for improvement of outcomes in high -risk 
subtypes of aggressive B -cell NHL.
Approximately  one-third of  DLBC L patients will be refractory  to or relapse after R -CHOP 
within five years of diagnosis ( Cunningham 2013 ).  Pati ents at high risk of rel apse to R -CHOP 
include those with a high internat ional prognostic index [IPI] score (Ziepert 2010 , Cunningham 
2013) , activated B -cell [ABC] or non -germinal center B -cell [non -GCB] cell of origin (Fu 2008 , 
Culpin 2013 ), and doubl e
-hit DLBCL, now referred to as high -grade B -cell lympho ma with 
MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements (Friedberg 2012 , Morgan 2013) .  In these 
high-risk groups, 50% or less o f patients are disease -free at two y ears (Ziepert 2010 , Culpin 
2013, Mo rgan 2013 ).  Overall survival (OS) for all DLBCL pat ients approaches 75% at five 
years (Cunningham 2013 ); however, in high -risk pati ents, i t may be as l ow as 25% -30% 
(doubl e-hit and non -GCB) to 50% (IPI 3 -5) at five years (Ziepert 2010 , Culpin 2013 , Morgan 
2013 ).
For those patients who are refractory  or relapse fo llowing front -line therapy and are eligible for 
hematopoiet ic stem cell transplant (HSCT), various high -dose, pl atinum -based salvage 
chemotherapy regimens are recommended (NCCN 2019 ). It is estimated that 35 to 50% of R/R 
patients are not suitable for high -dose chemotherapy ,for reasons including (but not limited to) 
comorbidi ties, poor performance status, or age, and thus not eligible for HSCT . These pat ients
may be treated with a plat inum and/or gemcitabine -based regimen such as rituximab, 
gemcitabine and oxaliplat in (R -GemOx ),which may  be combined wi th involved-field radi ation 
therapy (El Gnaoui  2007 ), or preferen tially be enrolled in clinical trials testing the activit y of 
novel drugs or combinat ions of agents . The effectiveness of co mbinat ion and single agent 
therapi es is limited to a minorit y of those treated .Recent ly, the FDA approved Yescarta ™
(axicabtagene ciloleucel), an ant i-CD19 CAR T cell product, to treat adult patients with DLBCL 
who have not responded to or who have relapsed after at least two prior lines of therapy.

Confident ial and Propri etary 24 Protocol 017006 Amendment 6: 16Aug 2021Therefore, there is significant unmet need for patients who are ineligible for tran splant following 
front -line therapy.
In order to provide a basis for sizing thistrial of second -line therapy in this pat ient populat ion, 
the Sponsor performed a meta -analysis (based on fixed and rando m effects models) on data from 
12published studies of second
-line therapy recommended by the NCCN guidelines for pati ents 
with R/R aggressive large B -cell NHL (Table 1). Of note, the patient popul ation in these studies 
included a mixture of diagnoses, numbers and t ypes of prior lines of therapies, and pat ient 
perform ance status, and did not exact ly match the populat ion to be enrolled in the current study .
This m eta-analysis shows an ORR of 46% (95% CI 0.43, 0.50) using the fixed -effect m odel and 
52% (95% CI 0.44, 0.59) using the rando m
-effects model . Addit ionally , the published m edian 
PFS ranged fro m 3 to 7 months, showing low durabilit y of response.  Taken together, these data 
show a high unmet need in R/R aggressive B -cell NHL pati ents who are not eligible for HSCT.
A retrospective patient-level real -world data cohort is being planned to generate a comparable 
external/synt heticcontrol , which will be used to provide anull hypoth esis for testing the primary  
endpo int of ORR. Generation o f this external  control  will be discussed in detail in a separate
real-world evidence study Statistical Analysis Plan.

Confident ial and Propri etary 27 Protocol 017006 Amendment 6: 16Aug 20211.2. CD19 as a Therapeutic Target
CD19 i s a 95 -kDa glycoprotein present on B -cells fro m early  devel opment until  different iation 
into plasma cells (Stam enkovic 1988
). It is a m ember of the immunoglobulin superfamily  and a 
component of a B cell surface signal transduct ion complex that posit ively regulates signal 
transduction through the B -cell receptor (Stamenkovic 1988, Brent jens 2011 ).
CD19 i s an attractive therapeut ic target because it is expressed by most B -cell malignancies, 
including B -cell NHL (Li 1993 , Li 1996 , Davila 2012 ). Importantly, the CD19 ant igen is not 
expressed on hematopoiet ic stem cells or on any normal t issue apart from those of the B cell 
lineage .
1.3. CD19 -Targeted Chimeric Antigen Receptors
CD19 -specific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are single chain variable fragments (scFv) 
fused to a transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic signaling domains. Expressio n of the 
CD19 -directed CAR in autologous T ce lls is achieved by  ex vivo transfect ion using a 
recombinant retroviral or lent iviral vector. The CAR is expressed on the T cell surface and 
redirects the transfected T cells to CD19- expressing lympho ma cells, leading to CD19 -specific 
tumor cell recognit ion, lysis, cy tokine secret ion and T cell pro liferat ion (Sadel ain 2013 ). In 
clinical studies, CD19 -targeted CARs have demo nstrated encouraging activit y in adult and 
pediatric subjects wi th R/R B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and B -cell NHL (Turtl e 
2016a , Gardner 2017, Neelapu 2017 , Schuster 2017, Maude 2018, Park 2018) . Promising results 
have been reported for different CD19 -directed CARs in the treatment of adult (Turtl e 2016b , 
Neelapu 2017 , Schus ter 2017 )and pediatric (Park 2016 )CD19 -positive lympho id malignancies.
Three CD19 -directed CAR T therapies have been approved by  the US Food and Drug 
Administrati on (FDA): 
Tisagenlecleucel , approved for the treatm ent of patients up to age 25 y ears wi th 
B-cell precursor ALL that is refractory  or in second or l ater rel apse and for adult 
patients wi th relapsed or refractory  (R/R) large B -cell lympho ma after 2or more lines 
of systemic therapy  including diffuse large B -cell lympho ma (DLBCL) not otherwise 
specified (NOS) , high-grade B -cell lympho ma, and DLBCL arising fro m follicular 
lympho ma(Kymriah ™United States Product Insert [USPI], 2018 ).
Axicabtagene cilo leucel , approve dto treat adult patients with relapsed or refractory  
large B -cell lymphom a after 2or more lines of systemic therapy, including DLBCL 
NOS, PMBCL, high grade B -cell lymphom a, and DLBCL arising fro m follicular 
lympho ma(Yescart a USPI, 2019 ).
Lisocabtagene maraleucel, approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed 
or refractory  large B -cell lympho ma after 2or more lines of systemic therapy , 
including diffuse large B -cell lympho ma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified (incl uding 
DLBCL arising fro m indolent lympho ma), high -grade B -cell lympho ma, primary 
mediastinal large B -cell lymphom a, and fo llicular lympho ma grade 3B ( Brey anzi®

The final JCAR017 investigational drug product includes 2 individually formulated CD8+ CAR 
+ and CD4+ T CAR+ cell suspensio ns in media containing dimethyl sulfo xide (DMSO) that are 
thawed and infused separately. JCAR017 is administered by  intravenous (IV) infusio n
.
The CD19 -specific CAR and truncated human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRt) are 
introduced into autol ogous CD8+ and CD4+ T cells ex vivo using a replication -incompetent, 
self-inact ivating lentiviral vector.  The CD19 -specific CAR includes an scFv bi nding domain 
derived fro m a murine CD19 -specific m onoclonal antibody  (mAb; FMC63) and the 4- 1BB and 
CD3ζ chain signaling domains. The EGFRt protein is expressed as a separate cell surface 
protein for purposes of cell tracking.

available pharmaco logy, toxi cology, clinical studi es, and adverse event (AE) profile of 
JCAR017.
1.5. Clinical Experience with JCAR017
Study  017001 i s an open -label, m ulticenter, Phase 1 study to determine the ant itumor activit y, 
pharmacokinet ics (PK), and safet y ofJCAR017 in adult subjects wi th R/R DLBCL NOS (de 
novo and transformed from indo lent lympho ma), high -grade B -cell lympho ma with MYC and 
BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements with DLB CL his tology, PMBCL, fo llicular lympho ma 
Grade 3B , and MCL. Two di sease -specific cohorts are being enro lled: the DLBCL cohort and 
the MCL cohort. Subjects in the DLBCL cohort must have been treated with an anthracycline 
and ri tuximab (or other CD20- targeted ag ent) and have R/Rdisease after at least 2 lines of 
therapy  or af ter auto logous -HSCT.
As of 12 April2019, 255 subjects with DLBCL have undergone lymphodeplet ion chemotherapy  
with low-dose fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day for 3 days) + cycl ophosphamide (300 mg/m2/day for 
3days) (fl u/cy), were treated with JCAR017 at Dose Level 1 (5 0×106JCAR017 cells) ,Dose 
Level 2 (1
00×106JCAR017 cells), or Dose Level 3 (150×106JCAR017 cells) and were evaluable 
for efficacy . The best response was a CR in 53% of subjects in t he efficacy analysis set treated 
at any  dose regimen wit h efficacy data . Overall, in a total  of 268
treated subjects , 42% of 
subjects experienced cytokine rel ease syndrome ( CRS ), and 6 subject s (2%) had Grade ≥3 CRS
(none Grade 5) . Neurotoxicit y was observed in 30% of subjects , 
including 10% wi th Grade ≥ 3 
neurotoxi city(none Grade 5) (Abramson 2019 ).

Confident ial and Propri etary 29 Protocol 017006 Amendment 6: 16Aug 20212. STUDY PURPOSE AND RA
TIONALE
Data from Juno Study  017001 dem onstrat e that treatment with JCAR017 in subjects with 
aggressive B -cell NHL who have failed 2 or more lines of therapy  resul ts in encouraging 
efficacy  resul ts and an acceptable safet y profile. Outcom es of  patients who have failed front -line 
therapy  are poor, and addit ional opti ons are needed. The purpose of this study  is to evaluate the 
use of JCAR017 in subjects who have failed 1 previous line of therapy for aggressive B -cell 
NHL and are not eligible for HSCT .
2.1. Rationale for JCAR017 Dose Level
As noted in Secti on1.5,JCAR017 at flat doses of 5 0×106CAR+ T cells and 1 00×106CAR+ T 
cells has resulted in durable responses and has demo nstrated an acceptab le safet y profile in the 
third-or greater line treatment of R/R aggressive DLBCL. Addit ionally, as of 07 Jul 2017, a 
trend toward improved ORR at 3 months was observed in pat ients treated at Dose Level 2 
(100×106JCAR017 cells) com pared to Dose Level 1: 63% (12/19; 95% CI 38, 84) vs 40% 
(12/30; 95% CI 23, 59).  See the JCAR017 IB for more inform ation.
Based on these results, the dose of 1 00×106CAR+ T cells has been chosen for development in 
the second -line setting. Depending on available data from ongoing studies at this dose at the 
time of co mmencement of subject treatment, the Sponsor may decide to limit enrollment to 
ensure an adequate safet y profile of this dose in the second
-line setting.
2.2. Rationale for Study Des ign
The purpose of this Phase 2 study  is to eval uate the efficacy  and safet y ofJCAR017 in adult 
subjects wi th aggressive B- NHL who have failed front -line therapy and are not eligible for 
HSCT. There is no approved standard of care for this populat ion. A non- rando mized design was 
chosen because of the lack of effective therapies in this populat ion (see Secti on1.1), leading to 
concerns about compari ng against an ineffective therapy  given the promising preliminary 
efficacy  resul ts in thi rd-line subjects (see Secti on1.5). Similarly, enrollment to a rando mized 
study  versus some assigned treatment is likely  to be difficul t, given the l ack of efficacy  of 
currently -used regimens and the number of clinical studi es ongo ing in this populat ion.
2.3. Rationale for Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy
As noted in Secti on1.5, preliminary data available fro m subjects wi th R/R NHL in Study  
017001 suggest that the low- intensit y lymphodepl eting chem otherapy  regimen used, 
cyclophosphamide (300 m g/m2/day × 3 day s) combined with fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day × 
3days), in combinat ion withJCAR017 has adequate safet y and good anti -tumor activity in 
subjects wi th R/R NHL. This lymphodepleting chemotherapy  regimen was selected to limit 
toxicity and retain ant itumor activit y, as well as to optimize cellular expansio n and ant itumor 
activit y after treatm ent wi th JCAR017 .
2.4. Rationale for Endpoint s
The efficacy endpo ints to be assessed in this study  are standard endpoints for the assessment of 
aggressive B -cell NHL. Disease response will be determined according to the

.
The safet y assessments are also standard assessments.
2.5. Risk/Benefit Summary
As di scussed in Section1.1, options for treatment of R/Rsubjects are limited. Transplant -
ineligible subjects have especially  limited treatm ent opti ons as they  are not eligible for the most 
commo nly used second -line t reatment (HSCT). Administration of JCAR017 has resulted in 
durable responses in subjects with R/R aggressive DLBCL in Study 017001, suggest ing that 
earlier treatment of subjects with JCAR017 could also provi de benefit.
Major saf ety findings wit hJCAR017 include severe cy tokine rel ease syndrom e (sCRS ), which 
has been associated in so me studies wit h higher dose levels o f CAR+ T -cell therapy . CRS i s 
characterized by  high fever, fat igue, nausea, headache, dyspnea, tachycardia, rigors, hypotensio n, 
hypoxia, my algia/arthral gia, and anorexia, severe (Grade ≥ 3) neurotoxicit y, and hematological 
disorders, including neutropenia, thrombocy topenia, and anemia (s ee the JCAR017 IB for more 
details) . In Study 017001, these toxicit ies have generally  been f ound to be m anageable. A 
management algorithm for the assessment and treatment of signs of CRS is shown in 
Appendix F. Guidance regarding m anagement of other safet y events is provided in Section7.
Overall, considering the poor prognosis in subjects for whom HSCT is not an option, and the 
potenti al for go od responses with JCAR017 , the benefit/risk is considered positive in this 
popul ation.

4.1. Overall St udy Design
This is an open -label, mult icenter, Phase 2 study to determine the antitumor activit y, PK, and 
safet y ofJCAR017 in subjects who have relapsed from, or are refractory  to, f ront-line 
immunochemotherapy  for aggressive B -cell NHL and are ineligible for transplant. Subjects will 
be treated with lymphodepleting chemotherapy and JCAR017 .
A schemat ic of treatm ent for each subject is provided in Figure 1. Upon enrollment, subjects 
will undergo leukapheresis to enable
JCAR017 product generati on. A baseline tumor biopsy
(either a histori cal sample, or if not available, a fresh tumor sample) will be obtained. While
JCAR017 is being manufactured, if required to control disease, subjects may receive salvage
low-dose chemotherapy  or one cycle of non-curat ive standard of care antitumor therapy  as 
described in Secti on8.2.2 .
Upon successful JCAR017 product generation, subjects will enter the treatment phase.  
Treatment includes lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy with flu/cy followed by JCAR017
administered IV 2 to 7 day s after com pletion of  lymphodepl eting chemotherapy.
If a subject has achieved a CR to JCAR017 and subsequent ly progressed, they may receive 
retreatm entonly if doses are available and rem anufacturing is not required (see Secti on8.2.8 ).
After administration of JCAR017 , subjects will enter post -treatm ent follow-up, and will be 
followed on this study  for 2 y ears for safet y, PK and bio markers, disease status, HRQoL, and 
survival, as described in more detail in Section8.  After complet ion of 2 y ears of assessments in 
this protocol , long-term follow-up (LTFU) for survival, lo ng-term toxici ty, and viral  vector 
safet y will cont inue under a separate protocol for up to 15 years.
Toxicit y will be evaluated on an ongoing basis by  the Sponsor and reviewed at regularly 
scheduled Investigator Safety  calls.  Addi tionally, safety monitoring boundaries based on the 
incidence of Grade 3 or above ,JCAR017 -related, treatm ent-emergent neurological toxicit y and 
prolonged Grade 4 and Grade 5 individual safet y events will be established using a Bayesian 
framework (Thall 1994 , Yao 2013 ),as described in Secti on10.4 and the Statistical Analysis 
Plan.If the safet y boundaries are crossed, enrollment will be paused and ad hoc Data Safety  
Moni toring Board ( DSMB)meetings will be held to review the data. The study  will remain 
paused for enrollment pending the DSMB recommendat ions.

course of the study  to eval uate safet y, protocol  conduct, and sci entific validit y and integrit y of 
the trial.Subject sa fety will be evaluated, and the DSMB will provide advice to the Sponsor and 
study  Invest igator s,as specified in the DSMB Charter. Following DSMB meet ings, the Sponsor 
will provide a DSMB review summary to the study Invest igators for submissio n to the sit e’s 
Institutional Review Board ( IRB) within 10 working days of receipt of the statement.
4.4.2. Independent Review Committee
An IRC will be established to determine response and progression status, as described in more 
detail in Section8.3.1 .
4.5. Suspension or Early Termination of the Study
The study  can be suspended or terminated at any  time by the Sponsor, the Food and Drug 
Administrati on (FDA ), at the recommendat ion of the DSMB, or at the recommendat ion of an 
IRB. Circumstances that may warrant suspensio n or terminat ion include, but are not limited to:
Determinat ion of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects
Dem onstrati on of  efficacy  that woul d warrant stopping
Determinat ion of fut ility
Determinat ion that the primary  endpoint has been met

6.1. Lym phodepleting Chemotherapy
The l ast dose of lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy must be administered between 2 days and 7 
days before JCAR017 administration.
Subjects will be treated with fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day for 3 day s) plus cycl ophosphamide 
(300 mg/m2/day for 3 days) pri or to treatm ent wi th JCAR017 . Fludarabine dose should be 
reduced based on renal funct ion (Secti on8.2.5.2 ). See Secti on8.2.5.2 for the recommended 
schedule of administration and for the assessments that will be performed during 
lymphodepl eting chemotherapy. Refer to the mo st recent package inserts for further details on 
administration of these agents. 
For subjects receiving retreatment, the dose of lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy may be reduced 
after di scussio n with the Sponsor.
6.2. Investigational Treatment: JCAR017
The lisocabt agene maraleucel (JCAR017) invest igational drug product is comprised of 
autol ogous CD8+ and CD4+ T cells that express a CD19 -specific CAR and a truncated 
epidermal  growth factor receptor (EGFRt) that are provided as frozen cell suspensions for IV 
administr ation. TheJCAR017 invest igational drug product is provided as 2 individually 
formulated CD8+ and CD4+ T cell suspensio ns in media containing DMSO for direct 
IVadministration in equal cellular quant ities into the subject.
The CD19 -specific CAR and EGFRt are introduced into autologous CD8+ and CD4+ T cells ex 
vivo using a replicat ion
-incompetent, self -inact ivating lent iviral vector. The CD19 -specific CAR 
consists of an scFv binding do main derived fro m a murine CD19 -specific monoclonal  antibody  
(mAb; FMC63) and the 4 -1BB and CD3ζ chain signaling domains. The EGFRt protein is 
expressed as a separate cell surface protein for purposes of cell tracking.
See the JCAR017 Product Manual for details of packaging and labeling, produc t tracking and 
accountabilit y, and product disposal and destruction.
6.2.1. Dose and Schedule
The dose of JCAR017 will be 100×106CAR+ T cells. JCAR017 will be administered after 
lymphodepl eting chemotherapy, described in Section6.1. Subjects must meet the criteria for 
treatm ent specified in Section8.2.5.3 .  Retreatment with JCAR017 will be allo wed in subjects 
who have achieved a CR and subsequent ly progress. See Secti on8.2.8 for more informat ion.
6.2.2. JCAR017 Preparation, Cell Thawing, and Administration
Each JCAR017 dose consists of CD8+ CAR+ T cells and CD4+ CAR+ T cells, administered 
separately  via IV. The subjec t must be continuously  monitored during each IV administration of 
JCAR017 . Assessments performed on the day  of administrati on are described in Section8.2.5.4 .
Each T -cell suspensio n (CD8+ cells or CD4+ cells) must be thawed and the labeled dose vo lume 
administered into the subject within 2 hours from removal fro m shipping container or liquid

6.2.3. Nonconforming Product 
6.2.3.1. Protocol Product Deviation Plan 
The JCAR017 Protocol Product Deviat ion Plan (PPDP) addresses the use of nonconforming 
investigat ional product in global clinical trials. The JCAR017 PPDP defines an assessment and 
decisio n
-making process that permit s release to the Invest igator and clinical site of drug product 
that does not meet the specificat ion for certain non -safet y related attributes (nonconforming 
JCAR017). In this process, the Medical Monitor and the Primary Invest igator at the clinical site 
agree that the healt h of the subject and the risk/benefit profile is acceptable for the subject to 
receive treatm ent wi th the nonconforming invest igational product. Development Qualit y 
Assurance then assesses the recommendat ion and is ult imately responsible for the drug product 
lot disposi tion. The JCAR017 PPDP is a standalo ne docum ent.
6.2.3.2. Exception Use of Noncon forming Product
Once a decisio n is made for the except ion use of nonconforming JCAR017, country -specific 
requi rements will be fo llowed for the rel ease of a nonconforming JCAR017 product to treat a 
subject enrolled in a JCAR017 clinical trial.  For example, approval  from local health authori ties 
and/or IRBs/ECs will be obtained where required.  Any subject will need to provide consent 
prior to receiving the nonconforming JCAR017 product. While subjects treated with 
nonconforming product will be fo llowed as p er the Tabl e of Events ( Appendix A) listed in the 
protocol , thei r data will be excluded from the primary  safet y/efficacy  evaluable analysis. Their 
data will be analyzed separately ( Section10). 
Subjects treated with nonconforming product will be replaced for the purposes of study  
enrollment of per protocol evaluable subjects.
6.3. Avoidance of Bias
This is an open -label, single -armed study . In order to reduce the chance of bias in efficacy 
evaluat ions, which could be used to support a registration in this populat ion, an IRC will be used 
to assess efficacy (see Secti on8.3.1 ).
Invest igators invo lved in the study must declare any relevant financial interests (see 
Secti on11.2.1 ).
6.3.1. Assignment of Subjects to Treatment Groups
All subjects will be assigned the same treatment.

Monitoring
Acut e infusio n reactions may occur with administration of 
JCAR017 . Guidelines for the 
treatm ent of acute T cell infusio n reactions are provided in Section7.7.
Prophylactic treatment/measures are strongly recommended for subjects at risk for tumor lysis 
syndro me (TLS), per institutional or clinical standards. Supportive care for the management of 
CRS i s detailed in Appendix F.In so me cases, tocilizumab, an ant i-IL-6receptor antibody , may 
be required to treat toxicit ies such as severe cy tokine release syndrom e. Please refer to currently  
approved RoActemra® prescribing informat ion. As a JCAR017 Investigator, it is important to 
understand that the JCAR017 Management Guidelines for Cytokine Release Syndrome and 
Neurotoxi city and the recommended use of tocilizumab is different from the CRS management 
algorithms for the approved CAR T- cell products. The Sponsor requires that all JCAR017 sites 
must have at least 2 doses of tocilizumab available prior to infusion for each subject in the init ial 
30-day post -JCAR017 infu sion period. If a site utilizes m ore than one pharmacy  facility, 2 doses 
of tocilizumab per subject are required in each pharmacy  facility. It is recommended to resupply 
in case tocilizumab is given.
The preferred dose to intervene in subjects with sCRS is 8 mg/kg. Other anti -IL-6 antagonist
shoul d be considered in the event of sCRS not responding to tocilizumab. Dosing of any other 
anti-IL-6 agent should be per the product’s prescribing information.
Prophylactic treatment measures for neurological toxicit ies are detailed in Appendix F.
The use of red blood cells and platelet transfusio ns, and/or colony -stimulat ing factors is 
permitted per inst itutional or clinical standards.
The use of prophylact ic or empiric ant i-infectiv e agents (eg, trimethoprim/sulf amethoxazo le for 
pneumocyst is pneumonia [P JP] prophylaxis, broad spectrum ant ibiotics, antifungals, or antiviral 
agents for febrile neutropenia) is permitted per institut ional standards.
Hospitalization may be required after treatm ent with JCAR017 to manage any  
treatm ent-associ ated toxi cities. Subjects who do not have adequate support outside of the 
hospi tal or do not have reliable transportation to th e clinic for scheduled evaluat ion or 
emergencies shoul d be considered for h ospitalizat ion for at leastthe first 7 days fo llowing
JCAR017 treatm ent.

A summary  of management of potential treatment toxicit y is provided below. See the JCAR017
IB for a complete discussio n of potenti al risks associ ated wi th JCAR017 .Cytokine rel ease 
syndro me (CRS) and neurologic toxicit ies (NT) are associated with CAR T -cell therapies. 
C
elgenehas developed specific toxicit y management guidelines (TMG) for CRS and NT 
associ ated wi th Celgene cellular products based on current clinical experi ence across the clinical 
development programs ( Appendix F). These recommendat ions are based on the CRS revised 
grading system ( Lee, 2014 ) and the CTCAE and need to be used for grading of CRS and NT to 
guide management in thistrial. 
If available and adopted as per site standard practice, CRS and NT grading according to the 
American Societ y for Transplantation and Ce llular Therapy  (ASTCT) Consensus Grading 
System  (Lee, 2019 ) shoul d also be recorded in the CRF to inform future modificat ions of the 
management guidelines.
7.1. Cytokine Release Syndrome
Administrati on of  CAR T cells, such as JCAR0 17, is associated with CRS. CRS is characterized 
by high fever, fat igue, nausea, headache, dyspnea, tachycardia, rigors, hypotension, hypoxia, 
myalgia/arthralgia, and anorexia. Clinical symptoms and severit y of CRS are highly  variable
(Lee 2014
), and management can be co mplicated by  concurrent condi tions.  Wi th JCAR017 , 
CRS usually occurs within two weeks after infusio n (Abramson 2017 ).
Fever, especially  high f ever ( ≥38.5°C or ≥101.3 °F), is a commo nly-observed 
hallmark of CRS, and many  features of CRS mimic infection. Hence, infect ion must 
be considered in all subjects presenting wit h CRS symptoms and appropriate cultures 
must be obtained and empiric ant ibiotic therapy initiated per inst itution standard of 
care.
Less commo n symptom s associ ated wi th CRS include cardiac dysfunct ion, adul t 
respi ratory  distress syndrome, renal and/or hepatic failure, coagulopathies, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation, and capillary  leak syndrom e. 
Neurol ogical toxicity has been observed concurrently  with CRS.
CRS has been reported in a few cases to be associated with findings of macrophage a ctivati on 
syndro me/hemophagocy tic lymphohist iocytosis (MAS/HLH), and the physio logy of  the 
syndro mes may over lap.
Please refer to Appendix Ffor adetailed descript ion of CRS, grading, and treatment 
recommendat ions.If available and adopted as per site standard practice, CRS and neurological 
toxicity (NT) grading according to the American Societ y for Transpl antati on and Cellular 
Therapy  (ASTCT) Consensus Grading System ( Lee, 2019 ) should also be recorded in the CRF to 
inform  future m odificat ions of the management guidelines.

The possibilit y of CRS shoul d be considered for all subjects wi th fever fo llowing JCAR017
infusio n. Subjects should be monitored closely for hemodynamic instabilit y and changing 
neuro logic status.
7.3. Cytopenias
Severe (Grade ≥ 3) cytopeni as, including anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and 
thrombocy topenia, can occur with both JCAR017 and lymphodepleting chemotherapy , and 
delayed recovery  has been observed.  Complete blood counts (CBCs) should be monitored after
JCAR017 infusio nuntil count recovery .  Foll ow insti tutional guidelines in the event of Grade ≥
3 
cytopeni as.
7.4. Infections
Life-threatening and fatal infect ions have been observed.  Severe infect ions may include 
bacteri al, fungal  (including pneumo cystis jirovecii), and viral infect ions (eg, cytomegalovirus, 
Hepati tis B vi rus, respi ratory  viruses, and oth er viruses).  A high index of suspicio n is warranted 
in the event of prolonged or recurrent cy topeni as, especially  in conjunct ion with 
hypogammaglo bulinemia, severe lymphopenia, and/or recent use of corticosteroids.  Viral 
reactivat ion and other serious op portunist ic infections should be considered in these settings, and 
prophylact ic, pre -empt ive, or symptomat ic treatment with ant imicrobial, ant ifungal, ant i-
pneumocyst ic, and/or antiviral therapies should be considered per institutional guidelines.
7.5. Neurologic Toxicities
CAR T -cell therapy is associated with unique neurologic toxicit ies. Neurol ogic symptoms may 
include altered mental status, aphasia, altered level of consciousness, and seizures or seizure -like 
activit y.With JCAR017, to date, the start of neu rologi c symptom s has been noted between 3 to 
23 day s (median 10 days) (Abramson 2017 )after CAR T cell infusio n and in severe cases may  
requi re admissio n to the intensive care unit (ICU) for frequent monitoring, respiratory  support, or 
intubation for airway protecti on. The symptom s are variable generally occur as CRS is resolving 
or after CRS resolut ion.
Please refer Appendix Ffor a detailed description of neuro logic toxi cities, grading, and treatm ent 
recommendat ions.Note: Tocilizumab is not recommended for the treatm ent of neurologic 
toxicities, unless CRS or MAS/HLH is also present.
7.6. Macrophage Activation Syndrome
Macrophage activation syndro me (MAS) is a serious disorder potentially associated with 
uncontrolled activation and proliferation of CAR T cells and subsequent activat ion of 
macrophages (see the JCAR017 IB for further background about MAS) . 
Macrophage act ivation syndro me is typically characteri zed by  high -grade, non -remitt ing fever, 
cytopeni as, and hepatospl enomegaly. Laboratory abnormalit ies found in MAS include elevated 
inflammatory  cytokine l evels, serum  ferritin, so luble IL -2 receptor (sCD25), triglyce rides, and 
decreased circulat ing NK cells. Other findings include variable levels o f transaminases, signs of

definit ive diagnostic criteria for MAS; it is t ypically diagnosed using published criteria for 
hemophagocy tic lymphohist iocytosis ( Schulert, 2015
). While there is considerable overlap in
clinical manifestations and laboratory  findings between MAS and CRS, other distinguishing 
MAS physical findings such as hepatospleno megaly and lymphadenopathy  are not comm on in 
adult subjects treated wi th activated T cell therapies.
Subjects treated with JCAR017 shoul d be m onitored for MAS, and cy tokine -directed therapy  
shoul d be considered as clinically  indicated.
7.7. Infusion Reactions
Administrati on of JCAR017 may cause infusio n reactions, including fever, rigors, rash, urticaria, 
dyspnea, hypotension, and/or nausea. To minimize the risk of infusio n reactions, all subjects 
shoul d be pre -medicated wi th acetaminophen and diphenhydramine. Mild infusio n reactions 
shoul d be managed expectant ly wit h ant ipyretics, ant ihistamines, and ant i-emet ics. 
Corti costeroi ds shoul d be avoi ded because o f the potenti al impact on efficacy of infused
JCAR017 cells. Rigors m ay be treated wi th meperidine.
The fo llowing gui delines shoul d be f ollowed for infusio n reactions:
Grade 1: administer symptomat ic treatment; continue JCAR01 7administration of 
both CD8+ and CD4+ components at the same dose and rate
Grade 2: stop administration of JCAR017 ; administer symptomatic treatment; resume
JCAR017 administrati on of  both CD8+ and CD4+ components at a reduced rate only 
after sym ptoms reso lve
Grade 3: stop administration of JCAR017 , administer symptomatic treatment, and 
resum eJCAR017 administration o f both CD8+ and CD4+ components at a reduced 
rate of administration only  after symptom s reso lve. If Grade 3 reaction recurs, 
discontinue JCAR 017; no further CD8+ or CD4+ components of JCAR017 shoul d be 
administered
Grade 4: discontinue administration of JCAR017 and administer symptomat ic 
treatm ent as necessary; no further CD8+ or CD4+ components of JCAR017 shoul d be 
administered
7.8. Tumor Lysis Syn drome
Both the lymphodeplet ing chem otherapy  empl oyed in this protocol and JCAR017 therapy  have 
caused TLS in adult B-NHL subjects wi th high disease burden. Subjects should be closely 
monitored for l aboratory  evidence of TLS (hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, 
and hypocalcemia ; see Appendix G) and subjects at high risk for developing TLS, such as those 
with high disease burden and high cell turnover, should receive prophylact ic treatment , including 
administration of allopurino l
, rasburicase or equivalent as per inst itutional guidelines, and 
hydrat ion,as per standard clinical practice.

-cell Aplasia
B-cell aplasia is an expected potential o ff-tumor, on -target toxi city. Prolonged B-cell aplasia has 
been observed in other CD19 -directed CAR T cell programs ( Davila, 2014; Grupp, 2013 ). Serum 
immunogl obulin levels will be obtained fro m all subjects prior to and at various time points 
following JCAR017 infusio n. Hy pogammaglo bulinemic subjects ( serum  IgG < 500 m g/dL) 
shoul d be considered for intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapy  per inst itutional 
guidelines .
7.10. GVHD
The likelihood of GVHD occurring with CAR T cell therapy is low, and while it remains a 
theoreti cal risk it does not apply  to pati ents enrolled in this protocol (exclusio n criterion #1 2). 
See the JCAR017 IB for further details.
7.11. Uncontrolled T Cell Proliferation
JCAR017 could theoreti cally proliferate out of control. If uncontrolled JCAR017 proliferation 
occurs, subjects may be tre ated with high -dose steroi ds (eg , methylpredniso lone 1 to 3 g /day, 
tapered over 1 week ) or lymphodeplet ing doses of cy clophosphamide (1 to 3 g/m2IV). If an 
Invest igator suspects uncontrolled JCAR017 proliferation, the Sponsor must be contacted 
immediately .
7.12. Replication -Competent Lentivi rus, Clonality, and Insertional 
Oncogenesis
Lentiviral vectors used in gene transfer are engineered to be replicat ion
-defect ive; however, 
generat ion of replication -competent lent iviruses (RCL) during manufacturing is st ill a 
possibilit y. Modern vector pro duction systems have been improved to reduce the risk of RCL 
generat ion. To date, there have been no reports of RCL generated during lentiviral vector 
manufacturing, which may be due, at least in part, to the use of self -inact ivating vectors such as 
the lentiviral vector used in the production of JCAR017 (Rothe 2013).
Concerns for possible vector integration into the host genome have arisen due to preclinical 
studi es that have shown retrovirus -mediated malignant transformat ionin mice (Li 2002 , Modlich 
2005) and monkeys (Donahue 1992 ), and a single clinical study  reporting development of 
leukemia in subjects with X- linked severe combined i mmunodeficiency (SCID) who received 
retroviral -modified CD34+ hematopoiet ic stem cells (Hacein -Bey-Abina 2003 ), including one 
subject who died (Couzin 2005 ). Of note, no instances of RCL generati on during production or 
lentivirus -mediated malignant transformat ion in animals or subjects have been reported to date.
Data has recent ly been published on the integration sites o f retroviral and lent iviral vectors used 
for T cell modificat ion in clinical trials (Wang 2009 , Scholler 2012 , McGarrit y 2013) . No 
clonali ty of integrati on si tes was observed. In addition, there did not appear to be enrichment of 
integrat ion sites near genes invo lved in clo nal expansio n or persistence.
Per the FDA Reco mbinant DNA Advisory Co mmittee guidelines (FDA 2000 ), all subjects will 
be followed in this study  for RCL and vector sequences for up to 15 years fo llowing JCAR017

unexpected pattern of JCAR017 expansio n and/or a new SPM arises. 
Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of interest and must be reported as 
serious adverse events. This includes any  new malignancies, r egardless of causal relationship to 
JCAR017, occurring throughout the subject’s ent ire participation in the study . 
If a subject 
develops a new malignancy, the Sponsor will request a tumor sample and blood samples ( see the 
017006 laboratory  manual  for details) for causalit y analysis related to use of integrating vector to 
determine if insertional oncogenesis is suspected.
7.13. Risks Associated with Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy
Subjects will receive fludarabine and cyclophosphamide prior to treatment with JCAR017 to 
facilitate lymphodeplet ion and CAR T cell engraft ment. Refer to the package inserts for specific 
details surrounding the risks of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.

A Schedule of Evaluat ions is provi ded in Appendix A. Specific visits are described in 
Secti on8.2and descript ions of study  assessments are presented in Section8.3.
8.1. Schedule of Evaluations
This study  will occur in 3 parts: pre -treatm ent, treatm ent, and post -treatment. 
Pre-treatm ent includes screening, leukapheresis, and pre -treatm ent eval uation and beg ins wit h 
assessing subject eligibilit y for study  enro llment. If eligible, the subject will undergo 
leukapheresis as soon as possible, fo llowed by  pre-treatm ent evaluation prior to lymphodeplet ing 
chemotherapy and JCAR017 administration.  If needed, subjec ts may receive treatm ent between 
leukapheresis and lymphodeplet ion as described in Secti on8.2.2 .
All subjects will receive lymphodeplet ing chemothe rapy prior to JCAR017 . All subjects will be 
assessed for response at 
approximately Day 29.
Post-treatm ent includes safet y and disease fo llow-up visits at approximately 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 
and 24 m onths after receiving JCAR017 . The Month 24 visit will be the EOS vi sit.
8.2. Study Visits
8.2.1. Screening (approximately 1 -2 weeks prior to leukapheresis) 
The screening process begins when the subject signs the IRB- approved informed consent 
docum ent and continues unt il the subject is determined to be eligible and the subj ect is enro lled, 
or until screen failure is determined. If a subject has had a screening procedure as standard of 
care wi thin 30 days of consent, it may  be used to evaluate study  eligibilit y.
The fo llowing assessments will be performed during screening:
Obtain informed consent (obtained any t ime before study -related procedures are 
perform ed).
Assess eligibilit y per inclusio n/exclusio n criteria. All inclusio n/exclusio n criteria 
must be met for subjects to continue in the study .
Obtain medical history , incl uding: disease di agnosis and history , HSCT history , 
chemotherapy, radiat ion and surgical history . If applicable, report/record history  of 
toxicities related to prior treatments and allergies.
ECOG performance status assessment (see Appendix E)
Physical examinat ion (see Secti on8.3.2 )
12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
Measure diffusing capacit y of the lung for carbon mo noxide ( DLCO )

8.2.2. Optional Bridging Therapy for Disease Control Prior to Lymphodepleting 
Chemotherapy 
Subjects m ay undergo an opti onal cycle of salvage low -dose chemotherapy  (eg, vincrist ine, 
rituximab, cycl ophosphamide ≤ 300 m g/m2) or non -curative standard of care chemotherapy  for 
disease control  prior to leukapheresis and/or while JCAR017 is being manufactured (ie, between 
leukapheresis and lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy). Examples of acceptable regimens inc lude:
Bendamust ine plus rituximab (BR)
Rituximab, cy clophosphamide, etoposi de, procarbazine, and prednisone (R -CEPP)
Rituximab, cy clophosphamide, epi rubicin, and prednisone (R -CEOP)
Rituximab, gem citabine, cisplat in, and dexamethasone (R -GDP)
Rituximab andlenalido mide
Other regimens may be acceptable after discussio n with the Sponsor.
Any selected regimen should be administered per inst itutional guidelines. Chemotherapy given 
after leukapheresis to m aintain disease control must be stopped ≥ 7 day s prior to 
lymphodepl eting chemotherapy, and the washout periods noted in the exclusio n criteria (see 
Secti on8.2.3 ) must be m et. The use of therapeutic agents with litt le/no evidence in the scient ific 
literature for DLBCL should be discussed wit h the Sponsor. If clinically indicated, l ocal 
radiation is allowed to a single lesio n or subset of lesio ns if other un -irradiated PET -posit ive 
lympho ma lesions are present.
If bridging ant icancer treatment is given, subjects must continue to meet eligibilit y criteria 
pertaining to adequate organ funct ion, active infectio ns, pregnancy , and washout of pri or therapy  
prior to lymphodeplet ion. If the subject has not had any cardiotoxic medicat ions or radiotherapy  
in which fields include the heart, screening assessments of cardiac function (MUGA/ECHO) do

8.2.3. Leukapheresis (Approximately 4 Weeks Prior to JCAR017
Administration)
Following enro llment on the study , a leukapheresis collect ion will be performed on each subject 
to obtain a sufficient quant ity of PBMCs for the production of the JCAR017 invest igational 
product. (See Table 4for washout periods prior to leukapheresis.) Should a technical issue arise 
during the procedure or in the immediate processing of the product such that it cannot be used 
forJCAR017 producti on, the subject m ay have subsequent procedure(s) performed (see

Subject eligibilit y criteria must be confi rmed pri or to starti ng the first cy cle of lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy. Low-dose chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy given after leukapheresis to 
maintain disease control must be stopped ≥ 7 days prior to lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy.
Lymphodepleting chemotherapy will be withheld if calculated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft 
and Gault ;Appendix C) is ≤ 30 mL/min or radi oisotope gl omerul ar fil tration rate (GFR) is

8.2.5.2. Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy (Approximately 5 Days Prior to JCAR017 )
Upon notificat ion from the Sponsor that JCAR017 will be available, lymphodeplet ing 
chemotherapy should be init iated so as to finish 2 to 7 days prior to JCAR017 administrati on. 
Subjects will receive 3 days of fludarabine (30 mg/m2, unless dose is adjusted as described 
below ) and cy clophosphamide (300 mg/m2).
The fo llowing assessments will be performed on each day before administration of 
lymphodepl eting chemotherapy:
Vital signs
Local  laboratory  assessments:
Chemistries
ECOG performance status (see Appendix E)
Record all AE/SAEs and conco mitant medicat ions (before, during, and afte r 
administration)
Antiemetic therapy may be given prior to lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy per inst itutional 
practi ce. Mesna may  be used for subjects with a history  of hemorrhagic cyst itis per institutional 
practi ce.
The recommended order and timing of admin istratio n is as fo llows:
1.The IV hy dration is 1 L of 0.9% NaCl given at 500 mL/hr starting 2 hours prior to 
cy
clophosphamide 
2.Fludarabine 30 mg/m2IV over 30 minutes 
If creat inine clearance 50 to 70 mL/min: reduce by 20% each daily dose of 
fludarabine
If creatinine clearance 30 to 49 mL/min: reduce by 40% each daily dose of 
fludarabine
Fludarabine should not be administered to subjects with CrCl <30 mL/min.
Creatinine clearance (est imated glo merular filtration rate [eGFR] by Cockcroft -Gault, 
refer to Appendix C) is requi red wi thin approximately 48 hours of lymphodeplet ing 
chemotherapy to assess the need to adjust the dose of fludarabine. Indirect cal culation 
of creatinine clearance should be performed using the Cockcroft Gault formula 
(Appendix C). Direct m easurement of creatinine clearance is also acceptable.

Confident ial and Propri etary 58 Protocol 017006 Amendment 6: 16Aug 20218.2.5.3. Criteria for JCAR017 Treatment
Subjects should not experience a significant worsening in clinical status com pared to init ial 
eligibilit y criteria that woul d, in the opinio n of the treating physician, increase the risk of adverse 
events associated with JCAR017 infusio n. Subjects who meet at least one of the fo llowing 
criteria on the day  of scheduled JCAR017 infus ion shoul d have JCAR017 administrati on 
delayed:
Suspected or active systemic infection
Onset of fever ≥ 38°C/100.4°F, not related to underlying disease
Presence of progressive radiographic abnormalit ies on chest x -ray, or requi rement for 
supplemental  oxyge
n to keep saturation greater than 91% 
Cardi ac arrhy thmia not controlled with medical management
Hypotensi on requi ring vasopressor support
New -onset or worsening o f other non -hematol ogic organ dy sfunct ion ≥Grade 3
Taking any of the prohibited medicat ions as described in Section6.6
Progressive vascular tumor invasion, thrombosis, or embo lism
Venous thrombosis or embo lism not m anaged on a stabl e regimen of ant icoagulation
Subjects with active infect ion must have JCAR017 infusio n postponed unt il the act ive infect ion 
has resolved (subjects with suspected/active infection must have negat ive culture for at least 24 
hours on appropriate antibiot ics or negative rapid viral panel).  Subjects with organ toxicit ies 
may not receive JCAR017 until the organ toxicit ies have recovered to ≤ Grade 2. In case of 
delayed infusio n, lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy may need to be repe ated after discussio n with 
the Sponsor (see Section 6.1).
In the event that a subject experiences any of the above, the Sponsor must be contacted and 
discussio n regarding delay of treatment must occur.
8.2.5.4. JCAR017 Administration —Day 1 (2 to 7 Days after Completion of Last Dose of 
Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy)
JCAR017 may be delivered in an outpatient setting at the Invest igator’s discretion. This setting 
isnot recommended for the fo llowing subjects:
Subjects who do not have adequate caregiver support
Subjects who are staying greater than 60 minutes from the clinical trial site at the time 
of treatm ent.
Subjects with disease characteristics that, in the Inve stigators’ clinical judgement, 
puts the subject at higher risk of disease -related complicat ions (eg, TLS)
Subjects with a psychosocial condit ion that puts them at risk for not following 
instructi ons
If changes to the JCAR017 manufacturing process are made, the Sponsor may mandate that 
subjects are treated in an inpatient setting unt il safety is confirmed.

disease response. Upon documentation of disease progression or treatment with addit ional 
anticancer therapies, radiographic tumor evaluat ion is no longer required. (Note, PET and CT
scans will be read locally and will also be sent to a central imaging laboratory  for assessment by  
an IRC ). Disease response will be determined according to the “Reco mmendat ions for Initial 
Evaluat ion, Staging, and Response Assessment of Hodgkin and Non -Hodgkin Lympho ma: The 
Lugano Classificat ion” (Cheson 2014 ) as described in Appendix B, as well as other pertinent 
clinical data as appropriate. Details regarding the IRC are available in the IRC charter.
Treatment decisio ns will be performed using assessment of response as per the Invest igator.
8.3.1.1. Pseudoprogression
If a subject demonstrates early  tumor progressi on (defined as occurring prior to/at 3 month safter 
JCAR017 infusio
n), the Invest igator is responsible for evaluat ing wheth er the subject is 
experiencing a possible pseudoprogression (ie, tumor flare, which is a local inflammatory  
reacti on indicating early  tumor response at si tes of  disease such as lymph nodes) (Cheson 2016 ).
8.3.2. Physical Examination
Physical examinat ions must include at a minimum neuro logical, cardi ovascular, pulmo nary, and 
lymph node examinat ions.  In addit ion, symptom -directed exams should be performed. 
The neuro logical exam  should include, at minimum, a physical exam to assess cranial  nerves, 
motor and sensory  skills, coordinat ion and balance.
8.3.3. Mini Mental State Examinations /Immune Effector Cell -Associated 
Encephalopathy Score s
The MMSE (see Appendix D) may be administered by  an appropri ately trained provider (eg, 
physician, nurse); a neurologist is not required.   Efforts shoul d be made to have the same 
provi der perform  the MMSE on a given subject to maintain consistency  of assessment. If 
subjects develop neuro logic symptom s suspici ous of  and/or di agnosed as neurologic toxicit y, 
subjects will have daily  MMSE exams unt il resolutio n of symptoms, unless the subject is 
medically incapacitated an d/or m edically unable to complete the MMSE. If ICE scores are taken 
per institutional practice, those scores should be recorded as well .
8.3.4. Vital Signs
Vital signs include temperature, respiratory  rate, heart rate, blood pressure, and SaO 2by pulse 
oximetry .
8.3.5. Tumor Biopsy
Fresh tumor biopsies should be collected at the indicated times in subjects with accessible tumor. 
Addit ionally , if a subject develops a new or recurrent neoplasm after treatm ent wi th JCAR017 ,

Immune responses to JCAR017 will be eval uated wi th an ant i
-therapeut ic ant ibody  (ATA) assay 
(plasma) to detect the presence of serum antibodi es that bind to the extracellular region of 
JCAR017 . In addit ion, cellular immunogenicit y may be evaluated by  testing PBMCs from  
subjects for the presence of anti-JCAR017 cytotoxic T cells.
8.3.9.2. Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Assessment of JCAR017 PK in blood will be determined by qPCR to detect the JCAR017
transgene (see below) and m ay also be assessed by f low cy tometry to enum erate the number and 
immunophenoty pe of JCAR017 cells .
8.3.9.3. Viral Vector Sequence Testing
Details regarding sample collection and processing are provided in the 017006 laboratory 
manual. The presence of vector sequences will be determined by evaluat ion of blood samples by 
qPCR. At any  time point ≥ 12 months after JCAR017 infusio n, if persistence vector sequence is 
detected in ≥ 1% of cells in two consecutive blood samples, the pattern for vector integration 
sites will be analyzed. If the integrati on pattern suggests a predominant integration site , a repeat 
analysis will be conducted within 3 months and further studi es including insert ion site analysis 
will be performed .
If a subject develops a second primary malignancy, the Sponsor will request a sample o f the 
neopl astic ti ssue for causalit y analy sis related to use of integrating vector to determine if 
inserti onal oncogenesis is suspected (see thelaboratory  manual), and an unscheduled peripheral 
blood draw for RCL and viral vector sequence testing (see also Section 8.2.12 ).
8.3.9.4. Biomarker Assessments
Biomarker assessments will be performed to evaluate JCAR017 , tum or, and immune system 
characterist ics that m ay be associ ated wi thJCAR017 efficacy and safet y. The assessments will 
include assessment of cy tokines and chem okines associ ated wi th CRS , neurol ogical toxicity,and 
immune cell funct ion and tum or and tum or microenvironment characterizat ion. 
Immunophenoty pic, molecular, and/or funct ionalevaluat ion ofJCAR017 and enumerat ion of 
immune cell subsets may also be performed.
Cytokines and chemokines will be measured in plasma and may also be measured in CSF as 
markers of immune act ivation.Potential correlations between cytokine/chemokine pro ducti on 
and efficacy  and severi ty of CRS and neurotoxi city will be assessed.
Immunoregul atory  pathways operati ve in the tum or microenvironment may  influence the fate 
and function of adoptively transferred JCAR017 T cells. Assessment of specific cellular 
elements wi thin the tum or and the tum or microenvironment will be performed on biopsy samples 
collected from lymph nodes, and other tumor sites (if accessible), to correlate the presence of 
these factors with response, duration of response and/or JCAR017 persistence and funct ion. This 
will include evaluat ion ofJCAR017 infiltration and prevalence, markers of JCAR017 phenoty pe 
and function, and locat ion ofJCAR017 relative to CD19+ tumor cells.
Flow cy tometryand/or m ass cy tometrymay be used to determine the phenoty pe of JCAR017

Molecular profiling assessments, including single nucleotide po lymo rphism (SNP), ATACseq, 
AbSeq, targeted mutational analysis, who le exo me/geno me sequencing, and/or gen e expression 
analysis (eg, RNA -Seq) m ay be conducted on JCAR017 cells, PBMCs and tumor cells in order 
to identify markers or signatures associated with clinical outcomes. Samples will be obtained 
pre-treatm ent, or isol ated fro m peripheral  blood, bone m arrow aspi rates, or lymph node biopsies 
post-treatm ent as available.
8.3.9.5. RCL Testing
Replication -competent lent ivirus testing will be performed geno mic DNA obtained by  a 
peripheral  blood draw , and, if posit ive, confirmed on PBMC if available . Details regarding 
sample collect ion and processing are provided in the 017006 laboratory  manual. Testing for 
RCL will ut ilize a PCR -based assay .
Samples for RCL testing will be collected at the time points 
specified in Appendix A.
If all samples co llected within the first y ear after the final dose of JCAR017 are negative, 
subsequent samples will be collected and archived. However, if any o f the sam ples are posit ive, 
the test will be repeated to confirm the result. If the repeat test is also posit ive, further analysis 
of the RCL will be undertaken in order to ascertain the nature of the RCL and potential effects. 
Subjects with detectable RCL are exp ected to continue to have blood samples co llected and 
tested until RCL is undetectable. Any confirmed posit ive result fro m RCL testing will be 
reported as an SAE within 24 hours of the Invest igator being notified, and as an adverse 
experience in the form o f an Investi gational New Drug applicati on (IND) safet y report. Relevant 
healt h authorit ies will be notified of the detected RCL in accordance with local guidelines.
Samples will  be archived wi th appropri ate safeguards to ensure long- term stabili ty and an 
efficient system for the prompt linkage and retrieval of the stored samples with the subject’s 
study  records and the production lot records. Archived samples will be destroyed as outlined in 
the separate LTFU protocol.
If a subject develops a second primary malignancy, the Sponsor will request a sample o f the 
neopl astic ti ssue (see 017001 l aboratory  manual), and an unscheduled peripheral blood draw for 
RCL and viral vector sequence testing (see also Section 8.2.12 ).
8.3.9.6. CSF Examination
CSF samples will be analyzed locally for cell count and different ial cytology (see Secti on8.3.8 ),

8.3.10.1. EORTC QLQ -C30
The EORTC QLQ -C30 i s a 30 -item scale co mposed of both mult i-item scales and single -item 
measures. All o f the scales and single -item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A higher 
scale score represents a higher level o f well-being and better abilit y of daily functioning. A 
10-point change in the scoring is consider ed to be a m eaningful change in HRQoL. Thus, a high 
score for a funct ional scale represents a high/healt hy level  of functioning; a high score for the 
global heal th status/HRQoL represents a high HRQoL, but a high score for a symptom scale/item 
represents a high l evel of  symptom atic problem.
8.3.10.2. FACT -Lym
The Funct ional Assessment of Cancer Treatment -Lympho ma (FACT -Lym) consists of the 
FACT -General scale and a 15 -item lymphom a
-specific addit ional concerns subscale (LYM). 
This scale addresses symptoms an d functional limitations that are important to lympho ma 
patients. Only the LYM subscale will be administered in this study . The LYM i tems are scored 
on a 0 (“Not at all”) to 4 (“Very  much”) response scale. Items are aggregated to a single score on 
a 0-60 scale.
8.3.10.3. EQ-5D-5L
EQ-5D is a standardized measure of healt h status developed by  the EuroQol  Group in order to 
provi de a simple, generic measure of healt h for clinical and econo mic appraisal. The EQ -5D- 5L 
consists of the EQ -5D- 5L descript ive system and the EQ Visual A nalogue scale (EQ VAS). The 
descript ive system co mprises dimensio ns (mobilit y, self-care, usual act ivities, pain/disco mfort, 
anxiet y/depressi on). Each dimensio n has 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate 
probl ems, severe problems, extreme proble ms).
8.3.10.4. Hospital Resource Utilization
Hospital resource utilization will be assessed based on the numbers of ICU inpat ient days and 
non-ICU inpat ient days. Dates of and reasons for admissio n and discharge to the hospital and to

Hospitaliza tion/prolongation of 
hospitalization
Note: complications and/or 
prolonged admissions for 
routine treatment or 
procedure do require SAE 
reportingThis classification does not apply for the following hospitalizations:
Admissions for social or situational rea sons (eg, no place to stay, live too far 
away  to come for hospital visits) in the absence of any clinical AE
Admissions at the discretion of the investigator for administration of 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy or JCAR017 
Admissions for elective or pre -plan ned treatment for a pre -existing condition 
that is unrelated to the condition under study and has not worsened since 
providing informed consent
Admissions for routine treatment (eg, platelet transfusion) or monitoring of the 
conditio n under study not assoc iated with any  deterioration in condition
Admissions for routine procedures (eg, bone marrow aspiration) associated 
with the disease under study 
Emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in 
admission, unless fulfilling other serio usness criteria above
9.2. Grading and Intensity of Adverse Events
AEs, wi th the excepti on of  cytokine release syndrome (CRS), will be graded using the NCI 
CTCAE, Version 4.03 (http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.ht ml). CRS will be graded according 
to the grading scale adapted fro m Lee, 2014 (Lee 2014) , whi ch is provi ded in Appendix F.
The reported verbat im term should be the most descript ive medical diagnosis , even if it does not 
match the CTCAE term used for assigning severit y.  
AE severit y and seri ousness will  be asse ssed independent ly. ‘Severit y’ refers to the intensit y of 
an AE, while ‘serious’ is a regulatory  defini tion and serves as a gui de to the sponsor for defining 
regul atory  reporting obligations.
9.3. Relationship to Study Drug
The assessment of the relationship o f an AE/SAE to lymphodepleting chemotherapy and
JCAR017 (related or not rel ated) is a clinical decisio n based on all available informat ion and the 
following considerations:
Related: Ther e is a reasonable possibility and/or evidence to suggest a causal rela tionship 
between study drug and the AE/SAE and no other more likely alternative cause 
(concomitant drugs, therapies, disease complications, etc.) is suspected.
Not related: Ther e is no reasonable possibility and/or evidence to suggest a causal relationshi p 
between study drug and the AE/SAE and another more likely alternative cause 
(concomitant drugs or therapies, disease complications, etc.) is suspected.
9.4. Recording Adverse Events 
AEs/SAEs are recorded on the CRF in accordance with the reporting criteria for different time 
periods as defined in Section9.5.  Each AE/SAE is to be evaluated for:

Outcom e
Seriousness (see Section9.1.2 )
Causal relat ionship wi th lymphodepl eting chemotherap y orJCAR017 (see 
Secti on9.3)
9.4.1. Recording a Diagnosis Versus Signs and Symptoms
Whenever possible, a unifying diagnosis should be reported as opposed to a list ing of individual 
symptoms. However, symptoms should be grouped into a diagnosis only if each sign or 
symptom  is a m edically confirmed component of that diagnosis as evidenced by current standard 
medical textbooks.  If any  aspect of a sign or symptom  does not fi t into a classic pattern of the 
diagnosis, the individual symptom should be reported as a separate AE/SAE.
One except ion to reporting a diagnosis as opposed to symptoms is the event of CRS.  If a subject 
experiences an event of CRS, a di agnosis of CRS and any  grade changes for the event of CRS 
shoul d be reported as an AE.  Individual signs and symptoms of CRS and grade changes for 
those signs and symptoms should be entered as CRS Symptoms in the CRF. 
When manifestations o f neuro logical t
oxicities appear in the presence of CRS or alone, those 
manifestations should be reported as separate AEs.
9.4.2. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments
Any laboratory  abnorm ality (eg, clinical chemistry or hematology ) or other abnormal assessment 
findings (eg, ECG or vital signs) that meets any o f the following cri teria shoul d be recorded as an 
AE or SAE:
Requi res m edical  or surgi cal interventi on (incl uding transfusio ns or growth factors)
Leads to product discont inuat ion, del ay, or inter ruption
Associ ated wi th clinical signs and/or symptoms
Otherwi se clinically  significant as determined by the Invest igator
The clinical diagnosis, rather than the laboratory  resul tor CTCAE term , shoul d be reported by  
the Invest igator (eg, anemia versus low hematocri t, neutropenia v ersus neutrophil count 
decreased ). 
9.4.3. Recording Serious Adverse Events
The fo llowing shoul d be considered when recording SAEs:
Death i s an outcome of an event.  The event that resulted in death should be recorded 
in the CRF and reported on the SAE Report Form.
For hospitalizations for surgical or diagnostic procedures, the illness leading to the 
surgi cal or di agnosti c procedure shoul d be recorded as the SAE, not the procedure 
itself.

criteria, itwill be reported as an individual SAE. 
When reporting terms rel ated to 
disease progressi on, specific manifestations of the progression (eg, “malignant pleural

reported, rather than the general term “disease progressio n.”
9.4.4. Death Reports
Death i s an expected outcome during this study  due to the nature of the disease being treated. All 
deaths must be reported on the Death CRF. Deaths du e to progressive disease will not be 
reported as an SAE unless considered related to a study  drug.  Any  AEs leading to death from 
the time the subject provides informed consent through 90 days after the JCAR017 infusio n 
shoul d be reported as an SAE accordi ng to Table 8.
Deaths that occur more than 90 day s after JCAR017 infusio n will  be captured on the Death CRF 
and reported as an SAE only if cons idered rel ated to any  study  procedure or JCAR017 .

9.4.6. Pregnancy
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies (including elevated βhCG or posit ive pregnancy test in 
a female subject of childbearing potential regardless of disease state ) occurring at any time after 
recei pt of JCAR017 must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning o f its 
occurrence. The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or posit ive pregnancy test must be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safet y immediately  by email , phone or facsimile, or other appropriate method,

10.3.3. Secondary Endpoints
The secondary  endpoints of the study  are:
1.The CR rate, defined as the proportion of subjects with a best overall response of CR. 
The CR rate will be assessed as described for the ORR in Section10.3.2 .
2.DOR from the first response following JCAR017 treatm ent (see Section 3for the 
definition of this endpo int).  DOR will be evaluated for subjects who achieve a response .  
DORwill also be evaluated for subjects who se overall best response is a CR .
If a subject does not have an event for the DOR analysis, the subject will be censored at 
the date of the last adequate disease assessments on or prior to the earliest censoring 
event. The censoring reasons can include ongo ing fo llow-up, di scontinuati on or 
completion of the study , receipt of another an ticancer treatment. 
Kaplan -Meier (KM) m ethodol ogy will be used to analyze DOR and DOR for subjects 
whose best overall response is a CR .
3.PFS, EFS, and OS following JCAR017 treatm ent (see Secti on3for definit ions of these 
endpo ints).
If a subject does not have an event for the PFS and EFS analysis, the subject will be 
censored at the date of the last adequate disease assessments on or prior to the earliest 
censoring event. The censoring reason can include ongoing fo llow-up, di scontinuati on or 
completion of the study , receipt of another anticancer treatment (for PFS only ).For 
assessment of OS, data fro m surviving subjects will be cens ored at the l ast time that the 
subject is known to be alive.
Kaplan -Meier (KM) m ethodol ogy will be used to analyze PFS , EFS, and OS.

(AUC) and other relevant PK parameter s of JCAR017 (including CD3+, CD4+, and 
CD8+ CAR -T expressing subsets) in blood
The PK parameters will be analyzed based on the PK analysis set.
The PK profile of JCAR017 cells in blood will be characterized, including C max, Tmax, 
AUC, and other relevant P K parameters.  Expansio n of JCAR017 in the blood will be

for the fo llowing ty pe of events: TEAEs, SAEs, Grade 3 or higher AEs, treatm ent-related AEs 
(lymphodepleting chemotherapy, protocol -mandated procedures, or JCAR017), and AEs leading 
to death. AESIs , including TEAEs of CRS, neuro logical toxicit y, infusio n react ion, MAS, TLS, 
Grade ≥ 3 infect ion, prolonged cy topen ia, as well as post -JCAR017 AEs of 
hypogammaglo bulinemia, autoimmune disorder, and second primary malignanc y,will also be 
summarized. Details of the definit ion and analysis of the AESIs are provided in the SAP.
Reporting of AEs will be based on the Medica l Dicti onary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) 
and CTCAE versio n 4.03 unless otherwise specified in the pro tocol  (eg, grading of CRS [see 
Appendix F). TEAEs will be summarized by system organ class (SOC), preferred term, and 
severit y. A subject who reports mult iple occurrence of TEAEs within the same SOC and 
preferred term is counted only once using the maximum severit y grade for summaries.
COVID -
19 AEs, identified by  the COVID -19 SMQ wi th subsequent m edical review for internal 
adjudicat ion, will be summarized by  preferred term  and toxi city grade. A list ing of COVID -19 
AEs will be provided.
10.3.6.2. Laboratory Data
All laboratory  data will be listed. The focus of laboratory  data summarizat ion (including 
hematol ogy, serum  chemistry ) will  be on treatm ent em ergent l aboratory  abnorm alities. A 
treatm ent-emergent laboratory abnormalit y is defined as an abnormalit y that, com pared to 
baseline, worsens by at least one grade within 90 days after JCAR017 administration . Local 
laboratory reference ranges will be utilized for this study .  Any abnormalit y occurring after the 
initiation of another ant icancer treatment will not be considered a treatment -emergent l aboratory  
abnorm ality. The baseline value is defined as the last available recorded value on or prior to the 
date of the first dose of invest igational product.
If baseline data are missing, then any  graded abnormali ty (ie, an abnormalit y that is Grade ≥ 1 in
severit y) will be considered treatment -emergent. Hem atological and serum biochemistry  data 
will be graded according to CTCAE Version 4.03, when applicable. Grade 0 includes all non -
missing values that do not meet the criteria for an abnormalit y of at least Grade 1. Grade 5 will 
not be used. Some laboratory  tests have criteria for both increased and decreased levels;
analyses for each direction (ie , increased, decreased) will be presented separately .

In the JCAR017 -
treated Analysi s Set, safet y subgroup analyses will be performed on the same 
variables as specified in Secti on10.3.4 . Subgroup analyses will be performed for key safety 
summaries and will only be performed if there are at least five subjects in each subgroup. Some 
grouping of classes will be considered if there are too few subjects in so me subgroups. Other 
subgroup analyses will also be performed if deemed appro priate.
10.4. Safety Monitoring Boundaries
Safety monitoring boundaries based on Bay esian fram ework (Thall 1994 , Yao 2013 )have been 
included to help detect safet y signals that may occur in the study .  These boundaries are non -
binding and the fo llowing toxi city events occurr ingwithin 30 days of a JCAR017 cell product 
infusio n will be considered as safet y events of interest f or monitoring:
A Grade 3 or above, JCAR017 -related, treatm ent-emergent neurological toxicit y
Prolonged Grade 4 and Grade 5 individual safet y events
Whenever the safet y boundaries are crossed, enrollment will be paused and ad hoc DSMB and 
SC m eetings will be held to review the data. The study will remain paused for enrollment 
pending the DSMB and SC’s reco mmendat ions.
More informat ion is available in the Statist ical Analysis Plan.
10.5. Sample Size Considerations
A sample size o f approximately  62subjects in the JCAR017 -treated Efficacy Analysis Set
provi des at l east 8 5% power to reject the null hypothesis of overall response rate l ess than 50% 
assuming the target response rate of 70% using an exact bino mial test with 1
-sided si gnificance 
level 0.025. EAST v6.4.1 is used to calculate the sample size and power.
The assumpt ionof the null  hypothesis of 50% ORR issupported by  the li terature and m eta-
analysis presented in Section1.1.  This meta -analysis shows an ORR of 46% (95% CI: 0.43, 
0.50) using the fixed -effect m odel and 52% (95% CI: 0.44, 0.59) using the random -effects 
model. Of note, the pati ent popul ation in thes e studi es included a mixture of diagnoses, numbers 
and t ypes of prior lines of therapy, and patient performance status, and did not exactly match the 
popul ation to be enrolled in the current study . A retrospective patient-level real -world data 
cohort is being planned to generate a comparable external/synt heticcontrol from a real -world 
evidence (RWE) study , which will  be used to provide a null hypothesis for testing the primary  
endpo int of ORR. Generation o f this external control  will be discussed in detail in a separate 
RWE Statistical Analysis Plan. Table 9shows the power to reject the null hypothesis of a 
response rate ≤ p0% (a potential range of est imates f rom the retrospective patient -level real -
world cohort) assuming the target response rate (pa) of 70% using an exact bino mial test with 1-

Confident ial and Propri etary 97 Protocol 017006 Amendment 6: 16Aug 2021Schedule of Evaluations Footnotes:
a) Serum pregnancy test must be done within 48 hours prior to lymphodepleting 
conditioning chemotherapy. 
b) If a previous tumor biopsy was performed since relapse or since determination of 
refractory disease, a tumor biopsy will not be required if adequat e tissue is available 
for analysis from the archived sample (see the 017006 laboratory manual for details).  
For subjects with accessible tumor that receive anticancer treatment for disease control 
while JCAR017 is being produced, abiopsy must be performed after completion of the 
intervening anticancer treatment and as close as possible to the start of 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy (recommended within 7 -14 days prior to start).
c) Not required if done at the study site for screening within 6 weeks and no 
intervening antitumor therapy has been administered. Must be done within 6 weeks 
prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy (see Section 8.2.4 ). If required, 
recommended within 14 days prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy. For 
subjects that receive anticancer treatment for disease control while JCAR017 is being 
produced, these assessments must be performed after completio n of the intervening 
anticancer treatment and as close as possible to the start of lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy (recommended within 7 -14 days prior to start).
d) If clinically indicated .
e) Required only for subjects with suspected or confirmed CNS involve ment, or as 
clinically indicated .
f) All evaluations and lab assessments must be done prior to administration of 
lymphodepleting conditioning chemotherapy or JCAR017 .
g) To be done on each day of lymphodepleting conditioning chemotherapy .
h) Weight only .
i) Measured within approximately 5 minutes (±  5 minutes) before and 15 minutes 
(± 5 minutes) after infusion, then approximately every 15 minutes thereafter for the 
first hour and hourly (±  15 minutes) for the next 2 hours. Continue to monitor vital 
signs af ter this point until stable and as clinically indicated .
j) Include r outine neurological exam .
k) Obtained anytime from Day 8 to 17; not required for subjects receiving retreatment .
l) PET and CT scan may be performed Day 22 to Day 29.
m) Not done for su bjects who have progression/relapse or received subsequent 
anticancer treatment. 
n) Not required if CR previously documented. o) If more than 1% of cells in test samples collected at the Day 365 visit or later test 
positive for vector sequences, the patt ern of vector integration sites will be analyzed. If 
a predominant integration site is detected, then the subject will be asked to provide 
another blood draw 3 months later for follow -up testing.
p) If a subject receives lymphodepleting therapy but not JCAR017 , all AE/SAEs 
should be recorded/reported for 30 days following the last dose of lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy. For subjects starting a subsequent non -chemotherapy -containing 
anticancer therapy (eg, checkpoint inhibitors, IMIDs) prior to 90 days following final
JCAR017 administration, all AE/SAEs will be collected after initiation of the 
subsequent therapy for 90 days following final JCAR017 infusion or 30 days following 
subsequent therapy, whichever is longer. For subjects starting a subsequent 
chemotherapy -containing anticancer therapy prior to 90 days following final JCAR017
administration, only AEs and SAEs related to JCAR017 and/or protocol -mandated 
procedures must be recorded/reported after initiation of subsequent therapy.
q) Starting from 91 days after JCAR017 treatment until EOS visit .
r) If any of the following clinical conditions are observed, an SAE should be reported 
unless the event can be definitely attributed to an alternative cause: second primar y 
malignancies; new onset or exacerbation of a pre -existing neurologic disorder; new 
onset of a rheumatologic or other autoimmune disorder; new onset of a hematologic 
disorder; rare and unexpected disorders with an unknown etiology (eg, Guillain -Barré, 
Stevens -Johnson syndro me).
s) Not required if B -cell recovery documented without recent administration of IVIG .
t) Prior to dose, it must be confirmed that the subject meets criteria for JCAR017
treatment as described in Section 8.2.5.4 .
u) Not required for subjects who have received subsequent anticancer treatment .
v) To be performed only for subjects with a first response ( CR or PR) documented at
the 3-month evaluation .
w) Pregnancy test and contraceptive counseling for females of childbearing potential.
x) If subjects develop neurologic symptoms suspicious of and/or diagnosed as 
neurologic toxicity, subjects will have daily MMSE exams (see Appendix E) until 
resolution of symptoms, unless the subject is medically incapacitated and/or medically 
unable to complete the MMSE. If ICEscores are taken per institutional practice, those 
scores should be recorded as well.

aA sc ore of 3 in many patients indicates a good prognosis with standard treatment, especially if at the time of 
an interim scan. However, in trials involving PET where deescalation is investigated, it may be preferable to 
consider a score of 3 as inadequate res ponse (to avoid undertreatment). 
Measured dominant lesions: Up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal lesions 
selected to be clearly measurable in two diameters. Nodes should preferably be from disparate regions of the 
body and should include, where applicable, mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas. Non -nodal lesions include 
those in solid organs (eg, liver, spleen, kidneys, and lungs), GI involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those noted 
on palpation. Nonmeasured lesions: Any dise ase not selected as measured, dominant disease and truly 
assessable disease should be considered not measured. These sites include any nodes, nodal masses, and 
extranodal sites not selected as dominant or measurable or that do not meet the requirements for measurability 
but are still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, which is any site of suspected disease 
that would be difficult to follow quantitatively with measurement, including pleural effusions, ascites, bone 
lesions, leptomening eal disease, abdominal masses, and other lesions that cannot be confirmed and followed 
by imaging. In Waldeyer’s ring or in extranodal sites (eg, GI tract, liver, bone marrow), FDG uptake may be

normal physiologic uptake (eg, with marrow activation as a result of chemotherapy or myeloid growth 
factors).

CYTOKINE RELEASE SYN DROME AND NEUROLOGIC 
TOXICITIES (V3.0 2)
1. MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITIES ASSOCIATED WITH JCAR017
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicit ies (NT) are associated with chimeric 
antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies. Celgene has developed the toxicit y manage ment 
guidelines (TMG) for CRS and NT associated with Celgene cellular products based on current 
clinical experience across the clinical development programs. These recommendat ions are based 
on the CRS revised grading system ( Lee, 2014 ) and the Commo n Toxi city Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) and need to be used for grading of CRS and NT to guide management in this 
trial.
If available and adopted as per site standard practice, CRS and NT grading according to the 
American So ciety for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy  (ASTCT) Consensus Grading 
System  (Lee, 2019 ) shoul d also be recorded in the case report form (CRF) to inform future 
modificati ons of  the m anagement gui delines.
2. CYTOKINE RELEA
SE SYNDROME
Administrati on of  cellular products such as CAR -expressing T cells can be associated with 
cytokine -associ ated toxici ty due to systemic production and release of various cy tokines into the 
circulat ion. Cy tokine -associ ated toxici ty, also known as CRS, is a toxi city that occurs as a result 
of immune act ivation (Lee, 2014; Gardner 2017 ).
2.1 Pathophysiology of Cytokine Release Syndrome
The hallmark of CRS is immune act ivation result ing in elevated inflammatory  cytokines. 
Cytokine release syndrome clinically  manifests when large numbers of lymphocy tes (B cells, T 
cells, and/or natural killer cells) and/or myelo id cells (macrophages, dendrit ic cells, and 
monocy tes) beco me act ivated and rel ease inflammatory  cytokines. Cy tokine release syndrome 
has cl assically been associated with therapeutic monoclonal ant ibody  (mAb) infusio ns, m ost 
notably  anti-CD3 (OKT3), anti -CD52 (al emtuzumab), ant i-CD20 (ri tuximab), and the CD28 
super -agoni st, TGN1412. Cytokine release syndrome is also frequent ly observed fo llowing 
administration of bi -specific T cell engaging antibodies for leukemia, and adoptive cellular 
immunotherapies for cancer, most notably CAR T cells. Incidence, time to onset and severit y of 
CRS due to CAR T cells is at least partially  dependent on the infused cell dose and tumor 
burden/ant igen densit y, presumably  due to m ore rapi d and higher l evels of CAR T cell 
activat ion. Onset of CRS symptoms ty pically occurs day s to occasi onally  weeks after t he CAR T 
cell infusio n, usually preceding maximal in vivo T cell expansio n. Cy tokine rel ease syndrome i s 
associ ated wi th elevated interferon gamma (IFNγ), interleukin (IL) -6, and tumor necrosis alpha 
(TNF -α) levels, and increases in IL -2, granul ocyte macro phage co lony-stimulating factor (GM-
CSF), IL -10, IL -8, IL -5, and fractal kine al though the pattern of elevated cy tokines varies am ong 
subjects ( Davila 2014; Hay 2017). IL -6 has been ident ified as a central mediator of toxicit y in 
CRS. IL -6 is a pl eiotropi c cytokine wi th anti-inflammatory  and proinflammatory  properti es. 
High levels of IL -6, present in the context of CRS, likely init iates a proinflammatory  IL-6-
mediated signaling cascade.

Confident ial and Propri etary 109 Protocol 017006 Amendment 6: 16Aug 20212.2 Clinical Presentation of Cytokine Re lease Syndrome
Cytokine release syndrome is characterized by high fever, fat igue, nausea, headache, dyspnea, 
tachy cardi a, rigors, hy potensi on, hypoxia, myalgia/arthralgia, and anorexia. Clinical symptoms 
and severit y of CRS are highly  variable ( Lee 2014 ), and management can be co mplicated by  
concurrent condit ions. In non -Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subjects treated with JCAR017, CRS 
usually occurs within two weeks after infusio n (Abram son 2017
).
Fever, especially  high f ever ( ≥38.5°C or ≥101.3 °F), is a commo nly-observed 
hallmark of CRS, and many  features of CRS mimic infection. Hence, infect ion must 
be considered in all subjects presenting wit h CRS symptoms, and appropriate cultures 
must be obtai ned and empiric ant ibiotic therapy initiated per inst itution standard of 
care.
Less commo n symptom s associ ated wi th CRS include cardiac dysfunct ion, adul t 
respi ratory  distress syndrome, renal and/or hepatic failure, coagulopathies, 
disseminated intravascul ar coagulati on, and capillary  leak syndrom e. 
Neurol ogic toxi city has been observed concurrent ly with CRS; refer to Section 4.
CRS has been reported in some cases to be associ ated wi th findings of macrophage 
activat ion syndrom e (MAS)/hemophagocy tic lymphohist iocytosis (HLH), and the 
physio logy of  the syndromes may  overlap ; refer to Section 3of this appendix .
2.3 Clinical Management of Cytokine Release Syndrome
Across vari ous CD19 CAR T cell products, early manifestations of CRS can predict more severe 
toxicity for both CRS and NT.
Subjects with B -cell acute lymphoblast ic leukemia (ALL) and high burden of disease are at high 
risk of developing CRS ( Frey 2017 ). Subjects wi th NHL who have high baseline tumor burden 
(measured by  the sum of product of the perpendicular diameters [SPD] or high serum lactate 
dehydrogenase [LDH; ≥500 U/L] prior to the start of lymphodepletion) also have a higher ris k 
for developing CRS and/or neurotoxicit y (Siddiqi  2017 ).
High baseline levels of other commo nly measured inflammatory  markers, such as ferrit in and C -
reactive protein (CRP), were also associated with CRS. 
It should be note d that, although useful for ident ifying subjects at higher risk for developing 
CRS, CRP, ferrit in, and serum cytokine levels should not be used for CRS clinical 
management/treatment decisio ns in the absence of other clinical signs and symptoms o f CRS; for 
example, a subject with an elevated CRP but no conco mitant symptom s may  not requi re 
intervent ion (Park 2017 ). Thus, cl ose observat ion of these subjects is strongly reco mmended.
A modificat ion of the CTCAE CRS grading scale has been established to better reflect CAR T 
cell-associ ated CRS, as detailed in Table 10(Lee 2014
).

Detailed CRS management guidelines are shown in Figure 1. Treatment should be individualized 
for each subject’s clinical needs. This guidance emphasizes the importance of early  intervent ion 
for Grade 2 CRS, or i n the setting of a rapid onset or rapid progression of CRS symptoms, to 
prevent the development of severe (Grade 3 or greater) CRS and neurotoxicit y.

HISTIOCYTOSIS
Macrophage activation syndro me (MAS) or HLH is a rare, potentially fatal immune -mediated 
disease, which is caused by impaired natural killer and cytotoxic T -cell funct ion. This syndro me 
has a wi de range of causes, symptoms, and outcomes, but all lead to a hy perinflammatory  
response (with so me characterist ics that overlap with CRS and organ damage ( Ramos-Casals, 
2014). Cases of MAS/HLH have been described in patients treated with CAR T -cell therapies 
(Neelapu, 2017 ).
3.1 Pathophysiology of Macrophage Activation Syndrome/Hemophagocytic 
Lymp hohistiocytosis
Macrophage activation syndro me/hemophagocy tic lymphohist iocytosis is divided into primary  
(genet ic) and secondary (react ive) forms. Secondary MAS/HLH is subclassified as viral, 
autoimmune, or tumor related. MAS/HLH has both infect ious and n on-infect ious tri ggers 
(Ramos-Casals, 2014
). Viral infect ion is the most frequent trigger, either due to primary 
infect ion or after reactivation in immunosuppressed patients. Bacterial and fungal infections can 
also tri gger MAS/HLH. Macrophage activat ion like syndro me (MALS) is a dist inct entit y that 
leads to early  death in sept ic patients and must be carefully ruled out in patients who are prone to 
develop severe infect ions, including patients fo llowing CAR T -cell therapy  (Karakike, 2019). 
Patients wi th hematol ogical malignancies, in part icular lympho ma, have a higher risk of 
developing MAS/HLH.
3.2 Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis of Macrophage Activation 
Syndrome/Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis
The presentation of secondary MAS/HLH is heterogeneous and characterized by  a panoply of 
clinical signs and symptoms. The clinical syndro me can be acute or subacute with non -specific 
symptoms appearing over few days to 4 week(s) ( Ramos-Casals, 2014 ). The cardinal features are 
continuous high fever ( ≥ 38.5°C) and enlarged lymphohematopoiet ic organs 
(spleno/hepatom egaly, occasi onally acco mpanied by adenopathy ). Pulmo nary, neurol ogic, 
cutaneous and gastrointestinal invo lvement may  also be present.
Laboratory  markers associated with MAS/HLH include pancy topenia, hyperferri tinemia, 
hypo fibrinogenemia and raised D -dimer l evels, hypertri glyceri demia, and abnorm alities in liver 
funct ion.
Detection of any ongo ing infect ion act ing as a trigger for MAS/HLH is crit ical ( Figure 1). 
Standard tests should be used to screen for infect ions caused by the most commo n viruses such 
as herpes, cy tomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein -Barr vi rus (EBV). Other infect ious agents (eg, 
mycobacteria, parasites, and fungi, particularly Candida and Mucor) should be ruled out 
according to specific clinical or epidemio logical  features ( Ramos -Casals, 2014; Lehmber g, 
2015). 
Bone m arrow i s the preferred anatomical site for investigation o f suspected MAS/HLH. Bone 
marrow aspirate can be negat ive at the init ial stage of MAS/HLH and should be repeated during 
the clinical course if there is a high suspicio n of MAS/HLH.

criteria below is fulfilled: 
1. A molecular di agnosis consistent with MAS/HLH 
2. Diagnostic cri teria for MAS/HLH fulfilled (five out of the eight criteria below): 
• High persistent fever ( ≥ 38.5°C) 
• Splenomegaly 
• Cytopeni as (affect ing 2 of 3 lineages in the peripheral blood): Hemoglobin 
<
90g/L, platelets < 100 × 109/L, neutrophils < 1.0×109/L 
• Triglycerides ≥ 3.0 mmo l/L (ie, 265 m g/dL) or fibrinogen ≤ 1.5 g/L 
• Hem ophagocy tosis in bone marrow, spleen and/or lymph nodes 
• Low or absent NK -cell act ivity (according to l ocal laboratory  reference) 
• Ferri tin ≥ 500 ng/mL 
• Soluble CD25 (i e, sol uble IL -2 receptor) ≥ 2,400 U/mL 
3.3 Clinical Management of Macrophage Activation Syndrome/Hemophagocytic 
Lymphohistiocytosis
Effect ive treatment of MAS/HLH requires mult iple simultaneous approaches ( Ramos-Casals, 
2014; Lehmberg, 2015 ).
1. Supportive care is essent ia
l because of frequent life -threatening severe manifestations at 
presentation.
2. The eliminat ion of tri ggers (parti cularly  infection) is crucial to remove the stimuli that 
initiate the abnormal immune system act ivation. Appropriate broad- spectrum ant iviral, 
antibacterial, ant ifungal prophylaxis and treatment must be init iated.
3. Suppression o f the inflammatory  response and cell proliferation by immunosuppressive 
and cy totoxi c drugs, respectively , is necessary . First line treatm ent includes IL -6-blockade with 
tocilizumab. Glucocortico ids are also indicated for the init ial treatment of MAS/HLH, 
irrespect ive of the cause (CRS Grade 4 treatment recommendations shoul d be fo llowed). IL -
1 
blockade wit h anakinra is suggested as second line treatment or in case of rapidly progressing 
clinical course. Ant i-IL-6 ant ibody  siltuximab might be considered as well as second line 
therapy . The use o f cyclosporin, cy clophosphamide, etoposi de and/or intrathecal methotrexate is 
not generally indicated in pat ients who develop MAS/HLH after CAR T -cell therapy, but may 
have to be emplo yed in refractory  cases. 
Newer em erging treatm ents include emapalumab ( anti IFN-gamma ant ibody ), which has been 
approved by  FDA f or the treatm ent of primary  refractory  or recurrent MAS/HLH ( Benedetti , 
2019).

Confident ial and Propri etary 115 Protocol 017006 Amendment 6: 16Aug 20214. NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES 
CAR T cell therapy is associated with unique neurologic toxicities. Neurol ogic symptoms may 
include altered mental status, aphasia, altered level of consciousness, and seizures or seizure -like 
activit y. With JCAR017, to date, the start of neurologic symptoms has been noted between 3 to 
23 day s (median 10 days) (Abramson 2017 ) after CAR T cell infusio n and in severe cases may  
requi re admissio n to the intensive care unit (ICU) for frequent monitoring, respiratory  support, or 
intubation for airway protecti on. The symptom s are variabl e and generally  occur as CRS i s 
resolving or after CRS resolut ion.
4.1 Pathophysiology of Neurologic Toxicities
The pathogenesis o f neurotoxi city is poorly  defined. Analysis of a subset of subjects treated with 
JCAR017 (study  017001 –TRANSCEND NHL001) wit h NHL who have high baseline tumor 
burden (m easured by the sum o f product of the perpendicular diameters or high serum LDH 
(
≥500 U/L) prior to the start of lymphodeplet ion) also have a higher risk for developing 
neurotoxi city (Siddiqi 2017 ). In addi tion, severe neurotoxicit y has also been reported in subjects 
with B-cell ALL and higher disease burden at the time of CD19 directed CAR T cell infusio n 
(Park 2017; Gust 2017).
Peak l evels of IL- 6, IFN-γ, ferrit in, and CRP are significant ly higher in subjects who develop any  
grade or Grade 3 or higher neurotoxicit y (Turtl e 2016 ; Heipel 2017 ). Protein levels in the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are usually elevated in patients wi th neurotoxi city, com pared wi th 
baseline measurements, suggesting disruption o f the blood -brain barrier. Other organ dysfunction 
(hepat ic and renal), as well as hypoxemia, and infection, might also contribute to the 
encephalopathy  (Neelapu 2018). In another study , it has been reported that evidence for 
cytokine -mediated endothelial act ivation causes coagulopathy , capillary leak, and blood
-brain 
barrier di srupti on all owing transi t of high concentrations o f systemic cytokines into the CSF 
(Gust 2017 ).
4.2 Clinical Management of Neurologic Toxicities
The optimal management of CAR T cell -induced neurotoxicit y is unknown at this t ime. These 
management guidelines represent the current state of knowl edge and addit ional inform ation will 
be provided to Investigators as it beco mes available. Management should also be guided as per 
institutional or standard clinical pract ice, and as determined by the Investigator or treating 
physician and/or cons ulting neuro logist. A thorough neurologic evaluat ion, including 
electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computer tomography  (CT) 
scan of the brain and diagnostic lumbar puncture and frequent monitoring of cognit ive function 
(eg, min i mental  status exams or handwrit ing tests) should be considered.
Treatable causes of neurologic dysfunct ion, such as infect ion or hemorrhage should be ruled out. 
Commo n manifestations of neurotoxicit y (eg, confusi on, seizure, aphasia), can also be seen wi th 
infect ion, electroly te imbalances , metabo lic acidosis, uremia , concomitant m edicat ion use (eg, 
narcoti cs), and other m edical condit ions. Other causes for such symptoms should be considered.
Magnet ic resonance imaging and CT scans of the brain are usuall y negat ive for any  anatomical 
pathol ogy that woul d account for the neurotoxicit y symptom s observed in subjects treated with 
CAR T cell  therapy , although rare cases of reversible T2/fluid attenuated inversio n recovery

Confident ial and Propri etary 116 Protocol 017006 Amendment 6: 16Aug 2021(FLAIR) MRI hyperintensit y involving th
e thalami, dorsal pons, and medulla, and cerebral 
edem a have been reported ( Neelapu 2018 ).
For subjects who have neuro logic toxi city in the presence of CRS , the CRS should be managed 
following the guidelines provided in Figure 1.
Neurotoxi city should be evaluated following the guidelines provided in Figure 2. For concurrent 
CRS and neurotoxicit y, the m ost aggressive intervent ion recommended by eit her guideline 
shoul d be empl oyed (if the recommendations for steroid doses differ, use the highest dose and/or 
frequency ). For subjects with Grade 4 neurotoxicit y with cerebral edema, high -dose 
corticosteroi ds, hypervent ilation and hyperosmo lar therapy  has been 
recommended (Neelapu 2018).
Note: Tocilizumab is not recommended for the treatment of neurotoxicit y related to CAR T cell 
therapy, unless CRS or MAS/HLH is also present. Results fro m 2 studi es, one of preempt ive use 
of tocilizumab shortly  after ant i
-CD19 CAR T cell therapy  in relapsed/refractory  NHL subjects 
(Locke 2017 ), and the other mandatory use of tocilizumab at first fever [> 38.5 °C] in pediatric 
ALL pat ients treated with anti- CD19 CAR T cells ( Gardner 2017), dem onstrated that early  
tocilizumab use eit her increased overall neurotoxicit y and Grade ≥ 3 neurotoxi city rates (85% vs 
62% overall; 35% vs 26% Grade ≥ 3) or provided no improvement in neurotoxicit y rates, 
respectively . These findings support the hypothesis that tocilizumab does not improve and may 
worsen i solated neurotoxicit y (Locke 2017 ).

Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
Statistical Methods
Details regarding the p ooled efficacy analysis of overall response rate (ORR) have been 
removed throughout the protocol
This analysis will still be performed. However, the details of the analysis will be presented in a 
separate statistical analysis plan ( SAP), and the results of the analysis will be presented in a 
different document than the 017006 Clinical Study Report ( CSR), since the analysis will ut ilize 
pooled data from  017006 and BCM -001 Cohort 2.

Endpoint , Section 10.5 Sam ple Si ze Consi derati ons 
Specified efficacy information for subjects enrolled in Study 017006 will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics without formal hypothesis testing 
Hypothesis testing for the primary efficacy endpo int of ORR will be perform ed on the pool ed 
analysis set only .Descript ive statistics of ORR will be provided for 017006 it self wit hout 
hypothesis testing. 
Revised sect ions: Protocol  Synopsi s, Secti on 10.1 General Considerations, Section 10.3.2

Timing of Analyses
Study 017006 p rimary analysis will betriggered when last enrolled subject treated with 
JCAR017 has been followed for at least 1 postbaseline assessment instead of 6 months
The primary  efficacy  analysis is onoverall response rate, which does not require 6 months of 
follow up to determine. Al l patients will be fo llowed for efficacy for 2 y ears or until death, 
disease progressi on, or wi thdrawal from  study , and the results summarized at the time of final 
analysis.
Revised sect ions: Secti on 10.6.1 Primary  Analysis
Sample Size
Increase in total sample size from at least 56 to approximately 62 JCAR017 -treated 
subjects on the 017006 study
The hypothesis -testing pool ed analysis will be based on a sample size of 80 patients fro m Study  
017006 and BCM -001 Cohort 2. This change to th e Study  017006 sample size allows flexibilit y 
in the number of patients included fro m each study.

Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
Study Assessments
Added guidance that if subjects develop neurologic toxicity, daily Mini Mental Status 
Exam ( MMSE )evaluations should be conducted until resolution of symptoms 
Following the publicat ion of the American Societ y for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy 
(ASTCT )Consensus Grading for Cy tokine Release Syndrome and Neurological Toxicit y 
Associ ated wi th Immune Effector Cells in 2018, discrepancies in neurotoxicit y assessment 
emerged between current JCA R017 protocol s and the new ASTCT guidelines.  In order to 
adequately  capture all  factors requi red to assess neurotoxicit y per the new ASTCT 
guidelines, daily MMSE assessments throughout the duration of neurotoxicit y events are now 
requi red. 
Also i nclud edinformat ion on collect ion of grading according to American Societ y for 
Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) Consensus Grading System .

Evaluat ions
Study Population
Revised exclusion criteria regarding tumor invasion of vessels and deep venous 
thrombosis ( DVT )/pulmonary embolism ( PE)following recommendation from data 
safety moni toring committee 
The exclusio n criteria that are being modified were originally  added in consultat ion with the 
JCAR017 Data Safet y Moni toring Board (DSMB) after review of an Urgent Safety Measure 
regarding the death of a subject in study  JCAR017 -BCM -001, a global Phase 1/2 study o f 
JCAR017 in relapsing/refractory  third-line aggressive B -cell lymphom a. Addi tional details 
regarding the fatal case on JCAR017 -BCM -001 suggested that the medical history  of DVT 
and PE, the therapeutic ant icoagulati on, and the vas cular invasio n by tum or, were not related 
to the cause of death fro m candida sepsis and respiratory  failure fro m candida pneumonia 
seen at autopsy . The subsequent rem oval of these cri teria was supported by  the same DSMB 
based on an analysis o f subjects wi th a m edical history  of DVT/PE and/or anticoagulat ion 
use in the 017001 (TRANSCEND NHL 001) study showing there was no increase of 
bleeding events or fatal events related to DVT, PE, or anticoagulat ion in pat ients on 
therapeuti c ant icoagulation or a medical history  of DVT/PE, respecti vely. Thus, the 
exclusio n criterihave been revised to only exclude patients with venous thrombosis or 
embo lism not m anaged on a stabl e regimen of ant icoagulat ion or pati ents wi th progressive 
vascular tumor invasio n, thrombosis, or embo lism.

1. OVERALL SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
Amendment 1 of Protocol 017006 was prepared to incorporate changes  
, further clarify various elements of the study, and correct errors identified 
after finalization . 
The following changes were made : 
• Revised inclusion criterion #5 to enroll subjects who are considered to be transplant 
ineligible (TNE) ; to define TNE criteria  based on age, performance status and co -
morbidities ; and to clarify that these subjects must also have adequate organ function (as 
previously defined in inclusion criterion #9, which has now been deleted and combined with #5). 
• Added that a retrospective chart review is being planned to generate a comparable historical control for statistical efficacy evaluation . 
• Added criteria for administering lisocabtagene maraleucel.  
The following additional changes were also made in this amendment: 
• The primary objective was updated to reflect the change in the eligibilit y criteria regarding 
TNE subjects.  
• The International Nonproprietary Name (INN), lisocabtagene maraleucel, was added.  
• Removed ‘autologous’ from hematopoietic stem cell transplant to align with the change to 
the eligibility criteria and to update background information.  
• Moved language regarding confirmation of diagnosis at relapse from inclusion criterion #7 to inclusion criterion #3 to clarify that histological confirmation of disease should occur at 
relapse, which is separate from the requirement for enough tumor material for later central confirmation. 
• Added to inclusion criterion #8 that subjects who have ECOG performance status of 2 are allowed on study to align with the change to the eligibility criteria regarding TNE subjects.  
• Added to exclusion criterion #3 that although previous treatment with CD19- targeted therapy 
is excluded, prior lisocabtagene maraleucel treatment in this protocol is allowed for the subjects who will be receiving retreatment to clarify that subjects eligible for retreatment will not be excluded because of previous treatment with lisocabtagene maraleucel in this protocol. 
• Revised exclusion criterion #5 and added a new exclusion criterion #6 to clarify that subjects who have a history of or active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection at the time of screening are excluded to clarify that not only subjects with active HIV are excluded, but also subjects who have had a history of HIV. 
• Added examples of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents that are not considered lymphotoxic and an additional example of lymphotoxic chemotherapeutic agents for clarity.

• Removed the anticipated number of study sites at which subjects will be enrolled to allow 
flexibility in the number of sites at which subjects may be enrolled.  
• Added that the estimated total time for all subjects to complete the study is approximately 3 years to allow flexibility in the amount of time it will take for all subjects to complete the 
study.  
• Added that the first treatment response will be done at approximately  Day 29 to align with 
the previously defined window for the first response assessment. 
• Removed that subjects can receive additional cycles of treatment and removed ‘post last dose’ throughout the protocol since only one cycle of treatment will be allowed (unless the subje ct meets the criteria for retreatment as previously defined in the body of the protocol 
[added to the synopsis for clarity]) to revise the treatment regimen to evaluate one cycle of treatment in this patient population.  
• Removed only from the study design description the null hypothesis and the target response rate because a retrospective chart review is being planned to generate a comparable historical control. 
• Revised justification for sample size to ensure sufficient sample size for analysis of TNE subjects and to allow analysis of this study independent of BCM-001, if needed. 
• Revised the language regarding the studies over which the DSMB has oversight to provide a more detailed description. 
• Added the recent FDA approval of Yescarta™, a drug similar to lis ocabtagene maraleucel, to 
the background information for this study to update the background information. 
• Clarified that the meta -analysis performed was used to provide a basis for the sizing of this 
study.  
• Revised the purpose of this study to evaluate the use of JCAR017 lisocabtagene maraleucel in subjects who have failed 1 previous line of therapy for aggressive B- cell NHL and are not 
eligible for HSCT to align with the change to the eligibility criteria regarding TNE subjects.  
• Added a new endpoint, duration of CR, for the secondary objective of assessing the rate of CR and durability of antitumor activity to analyze duration of CR in this patient population. 
• Language regarding subject discontinuation from further study treatment was revised to clarify tha t discontinuation from study treatment refers to situations in which a subject does 
not receive the full dose of JCAR017 and that progressive disease is not a reason for discontinuation of JCAR017 treatment. 
• Removed the plan name, Juno’s Protocol Product Deviation Plan (PPDP), while the description of the process is still maintained to  allow patients to receive lisocabtagene 
maraleucel even if certain product specifications are not met  
.  
• Guidelines for the management of CRS and neurotoxicity were updated to align management guidelines across all ongoing lisocabtagene maraleucel protocols.

• Revised the example of high -dose steroids that could be used to manage uncontrolled T cell 
proliferation for correction. 
• For clarity, revis ed language that Investigators must  rather than should contact the Sponsor 
immediately if an unexpected pattern of lisocabtagene maraleucel expansion and/or a new 
malignancy arises.  
• Added that PET/CT scans will need to be repeated following the administra tion of optional 
bridging chemotherapy to obtain appropriate disease measurements prior to study treatment. 
• For correction, removed having no intervening anticancer treatment as a parameter of adequate tissue being available from a previous archived tumor biopsy that was performed since the last relapse or since determination of refractory disease.  
• For patient safety, added that subjects who have high baseline tumor burden ( as measured by 
the sum of product of the perpendicular diameters [SPD]) or high ser um lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH; ≥ 500 U/L prior to the start of lymphodepletion) have a higher risk for developing neurotoxicity and should be closely monitored.  
• Removed that archived samples will be destroyed as outlined in the LTFU protocol because this is not applicable to this protocol. 
• Clarified that exacerbation of rheumatologic or other autoimmune disorder should be considered in serious adverse event (SAE) reporting. 
• The causal relationship with protocol-mandated procedures was removed from the list of items to be evaluated for each AE.  Investigators will record AEs resulting from protocol-mandated procedures per the reporting periods specified in Table 10 of the protocol; therefore, the relationship of these AEs to protocol- mandated procedures will  already be 
defined. 
• Revised language regarding reporting disease progression as an SAE to clarify how to report disease progression when it meets any of the seriousness criteria.  
• Removed that reporting pregnancies ensure subject safety to clarify that reporting the pregnancies will not ensure subject safety. 
• Revised ‘dose’ to ‘infusion’ in the definition of the Lisocabtagene Maraleucel -Treated 
Analysis Set  for clarity.  
• Added a new analysis set for lisocabtagene maraleucel -treated TNE  subjects to allow 
analysis in alignment with the newly revised eligibility criteria for TNE subjects.  
• Corrected verb tense to align with the fact that there is only one primary endpoint for this study.  
• Revised the primary efficacy analysis set to be newly  added Lisocabtagene Maraleucel -
Treated TNE Analysis Set to allow analysis in alignment with the newly revised eligibility criteria for TNE subjects.

• Removed that PK parameters will be estimated from the individual concentration -time 
profiles using a noncompartmental analysis approach to clarify that a noncompartmental 
analysis approach will not be used. 
• For correction, r evised the definition of a treatment- emergent laboratory abnormality as one 
that, compared to baseline, worsens by at least one grade within 90 days after the final cycle of investigational product lisocabtagene maraleucel, not after lymphodepleting chemotherapy.  
• Added that the primary analysis is planned after at least 56 TNE subjects have received lisocabtagene maraleucel and removed the B CM-001 study to clarify when the primary 
analysis will be performed based on the revised eligibility criteria and allow analysis of this study independent of BCM-001, if needed. 
• Added footnote c to tumor biopsy in the screening assessments to clarify that a tumor biopsy may not be required for eligibility.  
• Added the Study ID. 
• Updated the statistician name and contact information. 
Other minor clarifications and administrative changes were also made.

 1. AMENDMENT RATIONALE  
Amendment 3  
The protocol dated 12 October 2018 was amended to update the medical monitor contact information, as 
well as provide an update to the stats section.  
Amendment 2  
Amendment 2 dated 12 Sep 2018 of the protocol A -101-WART -301 has been amended to include subje cts ≥ 
1 years of age and to clarify the application procedures for younger subjects randomized to the study.  This 
change in inclusion criteria is at the request of the FDA following a review of the pediatric plan for this 
program.  
Amendment 1  
The protocol  dated 09 July 2018 has been amended to change the patient instruction sheet, to provide 
updated information on how to return the used applicators to the site for final accountability.  The rationale for this change is to simplify the instructions provided for any product which may remain in the applicator 
after it is applied at home, by removing the need to express any remaining product and the need to use a 
sharps container for disposal.  The protocol was also amended to clarify that cantharidin has a 28 day wash 
out window prior to joining the study, and that the concomitant use of cantharidin is prohibited while on study .   
Lastly, the study title has been updated throughout the document to include the branded study name, THWART.

 Study Design:   
This is a phase 3 , multicenter, randomized vehicle controlled, double blind parallel group study  to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of A -101 45 % vs Vehicle in subjects with common warts . Investig ators 
will be required to identify at least 1 and up to 6 clearly identifiable c ommon warts for treatment with 
A-101 study medication.  All  identified common warts  will be treated twice a week for up to 8 weeks  
(maximum of 16 treatment applications) . Subje cts will be followed for 12 weeks after  Visit 9.         
 
Approximately 500 subject s will be randomized to one of 2  treatment arms in a 1: 1 ratio .  Of the 500 
subjects randomized, approximately 100 subjects will be between 1 and 17years of age .  The duration 
of study participation is anticipated to be up to a maximum of 15 8 days per subject.   
 Safety will be evaluated based on clinical laboratory studies (hematology and clinical chemistry), vital 
signs, assessment of local skin reactions (LSRs), assessment of adverse events (AEs), physical exams, 
and concomitant medication review.   
 
Efficacy will be evaluated based on assessment of each identified common wart  according to the 
Physician  Wart  Assessment (P WA)scale .  The Investigator should NOT refer to any other assessments or 
previous assessments  to assist with this evaluation.  
 
Sites  will be required to take standardized color photographs to assist with the documentation of the 
appearance and location of each identified common wart  throughout the study.  These photographs 
are not to be used when performing the PWA.   
 
Number of Patie nts to be Enrolled:  
 Approximately 500 subjects will be randomized to the study.   
Number of Study Sites:  
 
This study will be conducted in the US only at approximately 25 treatment centers.

 Criteria for Evaluation  
Efficacy:  
The investigator will evaluate the severity of the identified  Wart s using the Physician  Wart  
Assessment ( PWA ) scale . 
 
Safety:  
Safety will be evaluated by following adverse events,  clinical laboratory exams, vital signs, 
concomitant medications, as well as through the assessment of local skin reactions, skin examinations 
and general physical exams.   
 
Study Drug Administration  
 
Study drug medication will be applied to each identified common wart  which meets  the requirements 
for retreatment  twice a week for up to 8 weeks  (maximum of 16 applications) .   At Visit 2, subjects 
who are 18 years of age or older will apply the A -101 study medication in the presence of the treating 
physician or a  member of the investigational site staff  who is a trained healthcare professional.   The 
second weekly application of the A -101 study medication will be applied by the subject at home.  
Subjects between the ages of 1 and 17 years of age will have their A -101 study medication applied in 
the offic e by a parent or legal guardian in the presence of the treating physician or a member of the 
investigational site staff.  The second weekly A -101 study medication application will be applied at 
home by a parent or a legal guardian.     
 
Study medication mu st be applied to each identified common wart  for approximately 15  seconds. The 
treated wart must remain undisturbed for an additional approximately 15 seconds.  This treatment 
cycle must be repeated up to 3 times to  the common wart .   If severe erythema an d edema develop, 
then the treatment cycle should be discontinued for that specific treatment application.

 The first sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint will be an analysis based upon the 
PP population.  This analysis will use the same CMH model described for the primary 
analysis.  A second sensitivity analysis will be c onducted for the primary endpoint using 
the same CMH model for the ITT population that includes the imputation of missing 
PWA data using a fully conditionally specified (FCS) regression- based Multiple 
Imputation (MI) procedure. To assess the impact of miss ing data imputation on the 
primary analysis results a tipping point analysis will be conducted.  This analysis will shift the treatment coefficient in the regression model used in the MI procedure to impose a worse mean maximum PWA for the A -101 45% arm and a better mean 
maximum PWA for the vehicle arm.  Details of this tipping point analysis will be specified in the SAP.  In addition, a model similar to the primary analysis model but stratified instead by Study Center will be performed as a sensitivity ana lysis including a

 5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Summary  
Warts are benign proliferations of the skin and mucosa that are caused by infection of keratinocytes by 
subtypes of the human papilloma virus (HPV) family.  Cutaneous HPV subtypes are a subset of this large 
group of the DNA papillomavirus family that is ca pable of infecting humans and causing cutaneous lesions. 
HPVs are ubiquitous in the environment and infection occurs most commonly through direct contact with 
individuals who harbor the virus clinically (evident  lesions) or sub- clinically, indirectly through exposure to 
contaminated surfaces, or even by autoinoculation of virus from individual lesions to adjacent uninfected 
skin. Cutaneous manifestations of HPV infection include common warts (verruca vulgaris), palmar and 
plantar warts, mosa ic warts, flat warts, and butcher’s warts. Common warts are generally small, rounded, 
hyperkeratotic, exophytic dome -shaped papules or nodules and are typically associated with HPV subtypes 
1, 2 or 4 though other subtypes are reported. Lesions are most com monly located on the fingers (including 
periungual and subungual regions), dorsal surfaces of the hands, and sites prone to trauma ( e.g., knees, 
elbows), but commonly occur at virtually any other anatomical location, potentially spreading by 
autoinoculation from the finger/hand lesions . 
In immunocompetent individuals, many common cutaneous warts (up to 2/3rds in some reports) may spontaneously resolve in less than 2 years. However, they often persist for many years, may be large and/or cosmetically unsightl y (e.g., face, hands), spread to distant anatomical regions by autoinoculation, be painful 
and/or prone to trauma, and, importantly, provide a significant reservoir of HPV infection in the community, placing (especially immunocompromised) individuals at ri sk for significant morbidity . 
There are currently no specific antiviral therapies available to treat cutaneous HPV infection and there is no 
FDA -approved topical treatment for cutaneous common warts. Existing therapies, many of which are off -
label uses of drugs approved for other indications, and many of which have never undergone the drug 
approval process, are  of unproven safety and/or efficacy, and are generally directed towards either the direct 
physical destruction of the lesions with locally destructive or ablative modalities such as cryotherapy, 
electrosurgery, curettage, application of acids ( e.g., salicylic acid, trichloroacetic acid); locally cytotoxic 
therapies, such as topical podophyllin, cantharidin, topical or intralesional 5- fluorouracil, or bleomycin; 
topical immunomodulatory or immunotherapy ( e.g., topical imiquimod, intralesional candida antigen, 
topical squaric acid dibutyl ester) or lesion removal. Several of these therapies are also available as over -the-
counter (OTC) wart therapies in l esser exposures than used in the office setting ( e.g., topical salicylic acid 
preparations, home freezing kits). Systemic therapy with agents such as cimetidine, and even local occlusion with duct tape have also been anecdotally reported to be effective in  some cases. While these methods may 
achieve cure in some cases, many require multiple visits to a physician’s office, and may require providers 
with specialized training and the use of expensive equipment. Such procedures can be painful, may require 
anest hesia and/or analgesia, and they can be complicated by adverse cosmetic outcomes including scarring 
at the treatment site, as well as the typical post- surgical risks of bleeding and infection. No one therapy is

 consistently effective in all cases and, in f act, there is great variability among practitioners in the methods 
employed using each of these techniques with great variability of the  results . 
Hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) is a compound that is ubiquitous in the environment. It is the simplest peroxide 
and a potent oxidizing agent commonly used in innumerable household goods including chlorine -free 
bleaches, general -purpose cleaning products, and disinfectants. Additionally, H 2O2 has been employed as the 
oxidizing component in hair dyes, and has been used in oral hygiene products and tooth- whitening systems 
for many years. In industry, it is employed in the treatment of wastewater. In high concentrations, it is used 
in bleaching paper, pulp, and textiles. Clinically, in addition to its use as an oral topical agent noted above, 
H2O2 is widely employed at low concentrations ( e.g., 3%-6%) as a wound irrigant and topical 
antiseptic/disinfectant, and has been in use medicinally since its introduction into clinical practice by 
Richardson in 1858.  ( Schumb, 1955)  (Chan, 200 8) (Richardson, 1866) (Richardson, 1891) (Watt, 2004) 
(Zonios, 2007) . 
H2O2 is an important oxidizing agent in biological systems. The local deleterious effects of reactive oxygen 
species on the skin are mitigated by the presence of a complex antioxidant defense system that includes, enzymes such as catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, thioredoxin reductase, lipoamine, 
lipid peroxidase and others, as well as non- enzymatic components including ascorbic acid, urates and uric 
acid, tocopherol, glutathione, ubiquinones, ubiquinol and other water -soluble groups.  The local application 
of supra -physi ologic concentrations of H
2O2 may overwhelm the antioxidant defense systems in the skin, 
allowing H 2O2 to act not only through its direct oxidation of organic tissues, generation of reactive oxygen 
species, and local lipid peroxidation, but also by the generation of local concentrations of O 2 that are toxic to 
the abnormal lesional (seborrheic keratosis) cells . 
 
An investigator -initiated, single -site, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, parallel -group proof -of-concept trial: 
“A randomized, double -blind, vehic le-controlled, parallel group study of hydrogen peroxide solution in 
adult subjects with common warts of the hand (WART -01), was conducted utilizing once weekly 
applications (maximum of four applications) of A -101 (hydrogen peroxide) 40% topical solution or placebo 
(vehicle) topical solution to investigate the potential utility of a 40% hydrogen peroxide topical solution for 
the treatment of common warts on the hands. A total of 15 subjects received 4 study medication 
applications. One subject achieved complete clearance of the Target Wart during the investigation, and data 
from this pilot study demonstrated a statistically significant trend towards clearing warts in the A -101 40% 
group when compared with the vehicle. It was the Investigator’s opinion that “ 1 or 2 additional treatments 
may clear the warts as most A -101 40% treated warts were “Near Clear” at the end of the four -week study”. 
The administration of A -101 40% over four applications one week apart showed no untoward effects and the 
treatment was well tolerated by all subjects. The data and clinical observations suggest that a larger study 
allowing greater than four drug applications and evaluating additional doses of A -101 topical solution are  
warranted .

 5.2. Study Rationale  
Aclaris has conducted three ( 3) Phase 2 studies to determine the dose response and dose f requency of 
A-101 (H2O2) Topical Solution in patients with common warts. The three studies conducted are 
identified below and they represent data collected from 406 subjects .

    • Study A -101-WART -201: A Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle -Controlled,  Parallel-  
Group, Study of A -101 Solution in Subjects with Common Warts  (n=90).  
• Study A -101-WART -202: A Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle -Controlled, Parallel 
Group Study of A -101 Topical Solution Applied Once a Week in Subjects with Common 
Warts  (n=157).  
• Study A -101-WART -203: A Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle -Controlled,  Parallel 
Group Study of A -101 Topical Solution Applied Twice a Week in Subjects with 
Common Warts  (n=159).  
 
The results from Study A -101-WART -201 evaluated two concentrations of A-101 (H2O2) 
Topical Solution: 40% and 45% (w/w) compared with vehicle. The 45% (w/w) concentrations 
demonstrated clinically and statistically significant results in clearing warts  while the 40% 
concentration had no effect when compared with vehicle. Therefore, A -101 40% topical 
solution was judged to be an ineffective concentration and not evaluated in further Phase 2  
studies.  
 
The results from Study A -101-WART -202, which evaluated a 45% (w/w) concentration of A -
101 (H2O2) Topical Solution when treating a single target wart and up to 3 additional warts 
showed that the 45% concentration applied once weekly resulted in a clinicall y and 
statistically significant clearing of warts at the end of the treatment period (Day 56) and at the 
end of a 12 -week post- treatment follow- up (Day 134).  
 
The results from Study A -101-WART -203, which evaluated a 45% concentration of A -101 
(H2O2) Topica l Solution administered twice weekly to a single target wart and up to 5 
additional warts showed that the 45% (w/w) concentrations resulted in clinically and 
statistically significant clearing of the target wart and all treated warts at the end of the 
treatment period (Day 56) and at the end of a 12 -week, post- treatment follow- up (Day 134). 
The results from Study WART- 203 were clinically and statistically significant clearance of warts 
at the end of the treatment period (Day 56) and at the end of a 12 -week post -treatment 
follow -up (Day 134), with consistently earlier and stronger results than the data from Study 
WART -202 which incorporated a once weekly dose regimen.  
 
A-101 (H 2O2) 45% (w/w) Topical Solution administered once weekly and twice weekly was well  
tolerated. Treatment emergent adverse events were predominantly mild and unrelated to 
study medication.   Local Skin Reactions (LSRs) were predominantly mild and transient. The 
LSRs of pruritus and stinging reported by subjects, and crusting, edema, erythem a, and scaling 
reported by the investigator following treatment generally resolved by Visit 13 (Day 134). 
There were no clinically significant changes during the study in laboratory evaluations or vital 
signs.

If a subject is to be withdrawn from the study, the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. CRA or designee must be 
informed within 24 hours  of the decision to remove the subject from the study.   
 
The study may be discontinued at the discretion of Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  Some examples of reasons 
for discontinuation are the occurrence of the following:   
• Increased frequency, severity or duration of known AEs  
• Medical, regulatory or ethical reasons affecting the continued performance of the study  
• Difficulties in the recruitment of subjects  
8.4. Withdrawal Procedures  
If a subject withdraws from the study prior to Visit 13, the reason for and the date of withdrawal 
from the study must be recorded on the eCRF.  If the reason for withdrawal is an adverse event  
or a clinically significant abnormal laboratory test result, monitoring of the subject will continue until the event  has resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a local health 
care professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is made . 
8.5. Subject Replacement  
Subjects that are determined to be scr een failures may be rescreened for the study and if 
determined to be eligible for the study they may be randomized using the same subject identifier.  A screen failure is a subject that signs an informed consent form for participation in the study but is determined not to be eligible for the study prior to the subject being randomized to the study.   
8.6. Subject Identifier (SI)  
The investigator or designee will assign a unique five -digit subject identifier (SI) to each subject 
at Visit 1 . 
The SI format will be NN -NNN where the first 2 digits are the investigational center site number 
(using leading zeroes , as appropriate). The final 3 digits are the subject number and must be 
assigned in ascending numerical order, without omitting or repeating any number, starti ng with 
001 at each investigational center. For example, the SI for the second subject that signs an informed consent at site number 04 would be 04- 002. 
The subject will be identified using the SI in all study documentation for the duration of the study .

    4Vital signs [including temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure, height and weight (Visit 1 only)] will be measur ed by a qualified staff member at 
Visit 1, Visit 9 and Visit 13.   
5Prior medications/the rapies will be collected for a time -period of 1 4 days prior to Visit 2.  Refer to Section  11 for a list of permitted and restricted concomitant 
medi cations.    
6A complete blood count (including hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet count, red blood cell count  and morphology , white blood cell count and differential 
(absolute and %) including basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils and a clinical chemistry panel including albumin, alkaline 
phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), bicarbonate, calciu m, chloride, creatinine, glucose, 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), phosphorus,  potassium, sodium, total bilirubin, total protein, and uric acid.   
7The treating investigator will identify at least  1 and up to 6 common warts located on the trunk  or extremities  that meet the inclusion criteria outlined in 
Section 7.    
8 The investigat or will use the Physician  Wart Assessment (PWA)  scale  to assess each identified common wart .  The investigator must assess the identified 
common warts  prior to application of the study medication at Visit 2- Visit 9.  In order to be eligible for randomization at Visit 2, each common wart must have a 
PWA grade ≥ 2.   
9 The investigator will measure the dimensions  (longest axis and thickness  of the common wart ) at Visit 1 and prior to randomization at Visit 2.  In order for the 
subject to be randomized at Visit 2 the identified common warts  must have the specific dimensions  outlined in Section  12.1.    The investigator will be required 
to measure the longest axis of each common wart  at Visits 2 -13. 
10 At Visits 1, Visit 2, 4, 6, and 9 (prior to study medication application),  and Visit 10- 13, a qualified inves tigational center staff member will take a photograph 
of each identified common wart  using the Aclaris supplied camera.  All photographs will be sent to a central imaging laboratory.   
11At a sub -set of investigational sites (up to 3 sites), subjects rando mized at these sites will have additional standardized photographs taken of their common 
warts  at the following time -points:  V2- 10 minutes post application, 1- hour post application and 24 hours post application.    
12Subjects will be randomized at Visit 2 prior to application of study medication.  Investigational study staff will re -confirm subject eligibility prior to 
randomization.   
13 The investigator and subject will assess each identified common wart  for local sk in reactions associated with irritation  at Visits 2 -13.  At Visit 2 -Visit 9 , the 
investigator  and subject  will assess  each identified common wart  for LSRs prior to the application of the study medication .  Refer to Section  13.1 for the 
complete list of Local Skin Reaction signs and symptoms.  
14 During in -office visits, subjects 18 years of age and older will appl y their A -101 study medication in the pr esence of the treating physician or a member of the 
investigational study  staff  that has been trained on the protocol .  Subjects ages 1 to 17 will have their A -101 study medication applied by a parent/legal 
guardian in front of the treating physician or a member of the investigational study staff during in- office visits.  If the identified common wart  meets the criteria

    for re -treatment as  defined in  Section  10.6  the lesion will be re -treated at Visits 3 -9.  Following application of study medication, subjects must NOT 
wash/submerge t he treated wart  for at least 6 hours and they must NOT apply any topical products to the treated common warts  for at least 6 hours.  
Parents/legal guardians of children must ensure that the child does not put the treated area in their mouth, or eyes, until  completely dry after the application. 
If the treated area is not completely dry 10 minutes after the application, the area should be blotted dry.15All subjects will receive their second weekly 
treatment of the A -101 study medication at home  on Days 4, 11,  18, 25, 25, 32, 39, 46, 5 3 as determined by the PWA assessment performed during the in-
office visit .  Subjects ages 1 to 17 will have their A -101 study medication applied by a parent or legal guardian.  All subjects will need to document the 
application o f A-101 study medication in a subject diary.  The second weekly treatment will depend on the PWA performed during the in- office visit that week.  
If the identified common wart  meets the criteria for re -treatment during the in- office  visit, then the subject/parent/guardian will perform the second weekly 
treatment at home.   
16All concomitant therapies including (topical and oral) prescription medications, over the counter medications and natural sup plements and non- drug 
therapies including chiropractic, physical therapy, and energy- based therapy must be documented in the subject CRF.  Subjects must not apply any topical 
products ( e.g., moisturizers, sunscreen, etc.) to the  identified common wart  within 12 hours prior to any study visit.   
17The reporting period for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) begins when the subject signs the informed consent  and continues through Visit 11.  Refer to Section 
Section  14.1.2   for instructions on the reporting of SAEs.  Non -serious clinical adverse events will be collected following the application of the study medication 
at Visit 2  and through Visit 11. Non -serious adverse events that occur between the tim e of consent and study medication application will be documented as 
medical history.   All safety reporting (AEs and SAEs) will conclude at Visit 11 (approximately 28 days after last study medication application) except for 
clinical adverse events related to local skin reactions.

    The investigational center staff member m ust compl y with the study medication storage 
conditions outlined in Section  10.1  
During Visit 2 -Visit 9 (if the identified common wart  meets the criteria for  retreatment) , the 
investigational study staff will select the appropriate study medication applicator for treatment of 
a specific subject. Subjects ages 18 years of age and older will apply the appropriately labeled A -
101 study medication to the identified common wart  in the presence of the treating investigator 
or investigational staff that has been trained on the protocol.   The second weekly application of the A -101 study medication will be applied by the subject at home  (Days 4, 11, 18, 25, 32, 39, 
46, and 53) .  The second weekly treatment will be determined by the PWA assessment 
performed during the in- office visit. If the identified common wart meets the criteria for 
retreatment, then the subject will apply the A -101 study medication at home. 
Subjects between the ages of 1 and 17 years of age will have their A -101 study medication 
applied in the office by a parent or legal guardian in the presence of the treating physician or a member of the investigational site staff  during Visit 2 -Visit 9 .  The second weekly A -101 study 
medication application will be applied at home by a parent or a legal guardian  (Days 4, 11, 18, 
25, 32, 39, 46, and 53) .  The second weekly treatment will be determined by the PWA 
assessment performed during the in -office visi t. If the wart meets the criteria for retreatment, 
then the subject will apply the A -101 study medication at home. 
Retreatment Criteria:  
 
At Visit 3-9, if the  identified common wart  has a PWA grade of >0  then the subject will receive re-
treatment with the A-101 study medication treatment .  However , treatment with the A -101 study 
medication should not be applied if any  of the following criteria apply to the identified common wart : 
• The common wart  has a pre-treatment LSR grade of 3 (severe) for any sign or sy mptom AND 
the grade has increased compared to the previous visit.  
• The common wart  is, in the investigator’s opinion, not appropriate for a retreatment (the 
investigator must note the reason on the subject’s Comments CRF page).  
• The common wart , in the Investigator’s opinion, cannot be visualized so the Investigator cannot 
assess the PWA.  
 If the identified common wart  meets the criteria for re -treatment during the in -office visit  (PWA>0), 
then the subject/parent/legal guardian should treat the common wart  at home on the protocol defined 
at home treatment days ( Days 4, 11, 18, 25, 32, 39, 46, 5 3.  A window of +1 day is allowed ).  If the 
subject is unable to tolerate treatment the day of an at home treatment visit due to severe skin 
irritation, then the treatment should be held and the investigational site should be notified.     
 
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.    
Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 
Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019  
 40  
    Subject s whose identified common wart (s) is assessed at a particular visit (V3 -V9) to be a PWA=0 will not 
have the that common wart re -treated at that visit (or retreated at the second at home application that 
week).   
10.6. Preparing the Study Medication for Application  
To perform a study medication treatment for  the identified common wart  a staff member will 
select the appropriate study medication applicator  from the identified subject’s kit. The following 
instructions  outline the procedure for application of the stud y medication to the identified 
common wart .  During each in- office treatment visit, the Investigational Study Staff will be 
responsible for reviewing the following instructions with the subject/parent/legal guardian and 
ensure that they understand how to properly prepare the applicator and apply the A -101 study 
medication.  
• For the in -office treatment applications, the Investigational Study Staff member will p repare the 
A-101 study medication applicator for all subjects, regardless of age by : 
o Washing their  hands prior to, and after completing the study medication treatments  
o Wear nitrile or vinyl examination gloves during the treatment; latex gloves are 
prohibited 
o Visually inspect the applicator for damage:  
 If the applicator appears damaged  do not use it for the treatment, contact the 
study monitor for disposal instructions and select an unused applicator with the next highest number for the treatment  
If the applicator is intact, proceed with the applicator preparation process  as outlined in Figure  1.

45%.  
2. Hold the  applicator so that the applicator cap is pointing up. 
3. Crush the ampule in the applicator by applying pressure to the center of the barrel of the 
applicator.  
4. Remove the sleeve.  
5. Tap the barrel of the applicator to ensure the solution is free of the crushed ampule. 
6. Gently remove the cap by twisting while pulling away from the applicator.  
7. Express a single drop of A -101 45% so that the tip of the applicator becomes wet.  
8. Apply the solution to the identified  wart s in a circular motion . 
 
All subjects will be supplied with treatment application instruction sheets at the completion of each in -office visit.

    10.7. Applying Study Medication   
All subjects that a re between the ages of 1 and 17 will have their A -101 study medication applied by a 
parent/legal guardian . Parents/legal guardians of children must ensure that the child does not put the 
treated area in their mouth, or eyes, until completely dry after the application. If the treated area is not 
completely dry 10 minutes after the application, the area should be blotted dry.  For in -office visits, the 
subject’s parent or legal guardian will apply the A -101 study medication in front of a member of the 
investig ational study staff to ensure there is a clear understanding regarding how the study medication 
should be handled.   
 
Subjects 18 years of age and older will apply their A -101 study medication to his/her identified common 
warts  in the presence of the treating physician or member of the investigational staff during in -office 
visits.  The second weekly application will be performed at home.   
 
The following instructions will be used by all subjects/parents/legal guardians applying A -101 study 
medication to all identified common warts :    
• Do not apply the study medications to eyes, nose, mouth, mucous membranes, or open wounds  
• Wear nitrile or vinyl examination gloves during the treatment; latex gloves are prohibited (All 
subjects will be supplied with nitrile  or vinyl examination gloves to be used for at home 
applications)  
• Thoroughly cleanse the common wart  by firmly rubbing with a swab/wipe wetted with 70% 
isopropyl alcohol  
• Using firm pressure  and with the tip of the applicator held over the wart , squeez e in the middle 
of the applicator  to apply one drop of study medication onto the common wart .  Using the 
smaller side of the applicator tip,  move the applicator around in a circular motion to fully 
saturate the lesion.  Apply the study medication for approximat ely 15 seconds.   
• Minimize exposure to the surrounding normal skin  
• During the treatment process remove excess study medication from the surrounding skin using 
a clean absorbent wipe . 
• Ensure the i dentified common wart  is fully saturated  with study medicatio n at the end of the 
~15 second application  
• Allow the treated wart to remain undisturbed for ~ 15 seconds  
• After ~ 15 seconds repeat the ~15  second application process  
• Repeat the application/waiting cycle until the study med ication has been applied to each 
identified Wart up to  3 times.  
• If severe erythema and edema develop, then the treatment cycle should be discontinued for 
that specific treatment application . 
• Absorb any remaining A -101 study medication and dry the common wart  and the surrounding 
skin without wiping or   rubbing.

    10.8. Dose Modification  
If a subject refuses to have a study medication treatment the investigator must report the visit 
number, visit date, and state the reason the subject refused to allow treatment in the subject’s  
CRF . 
If the subject’s refusal is associated with an AE, the investigator must also report the event on the appropriate CRF . 
10.9. Breaking the Blind  
The blind may be broken ONLY in the event of a medical emergency, in which knowledge of the study medic ation identity is critical to the management of the subject’s course of treatment.  
Before breaking the blind , the investigator should determine that the information is necessary.  In 
many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not study medicat ion-related, the 
problem may be effectively managed by assuming that the subject is receiving an active study medication without the need for unblinding.  
If deemed necessary to break the blind for a study subject, attempt to contact the Medical Monitor to obtain permission to break the blind of a particular subject.  If it is not possible to contact the Medical Monitor beforehand, contact her/him as soon as possible after breaking the blind for a subject.

12.1. Common  Wart Identification  
At Visit 1, the investigator will identify at le ast one 1 and up to 6 common warts  for treatment 
and evaluation.  
At Visit 1, each identified common w art must:  
• Have a longest axis that is ≥3  mm and  ≤8 mm 
• Have a thickness  ≤3mm  
• Be a discrete  lesion , i.e. each wart meeting the entry criteria must be clearly 
separated from other warts  
• Be present for at least 4 weeks  
• Not be a periungual, subungual, genital , anal, mosaic, plantar, flat or filiform  wart  
• Not be in an intertriginous fold  
• Not be covered wi th hair which, in the Investigator’s opinion, would interfere with the 
study medication treatments or the study evaluations  
Not be in an area that may be occluded ( e.g., by clothing or footwear or in a  skin fold).  
Record the location of each identified common wart  on the body charts in the CRFs indicating 
landmarks and distances to assist with confirming the location of the identified common wart  at 
subsequent visits .

    12.2. Standardized Photography  
At Visits 1, 2 , 4, 6, 9- 13 a qualified inve stigational center staff member will take standardized 
color photographs of  each identified common wart .  
Subjects at a sub -set of investigational sites (up to 3) will have additional standardized 
photographs taken of their each ident ified common wart at the following time -points:  
• V2:  10 minutes post application 
• V2:  1 -hour post application 
• V2:  24- hour post application 
The photographs are to document the appearance and location of the each identified common 
wart.  The subject’s ident ity will not be revealed in the study photographs . 
At Visit 2, the photographs must be taken prior to the study medication application.  
Care must be taken to ensure the same lighting, background, subject positioning relative to the camera and camera settin gs are used for each photograph.  
Sites will be provided with photography e quipment  and s upplies  necessary for obtaining the 
common wart  photographs.  D etailed instructions for obtaining and managing the photographs 
will be documented i n the study specific Photography Manual and provided to the site at the 
study initiation visit.

12.3. Physician’s Wart Assessment (PWA)  
The Physician’s Wart Assessment (PWA) is the Investigator’s assessment of the severity of each 
identified common wart  at a pa rticular time point. The Investigator should NOT refer to any other 
assessments to assist with this evaluation. This evaluation IS NOT a comparison with the PWA  
performed  at any other  visit.  
  At every study visit, the Investigator will assess each identified common wart  and report the one 
integer that best describes the common wart  severity using the following scale. At any visit where a 
study medication treatment is performed, the PWA must be completed prior to the treatment 
visit.  
Physician’s  Wart  Assessment  
Grade  Descri ptor 
0 Clear: No  visible wart.   No further treatment is indicated  
  
1 Near  Clear:  a visible wart  that is less than 3  mm in maximal diameter (or length)  
2 A visible wart  ≥ 3 mm and < 6 mm in maximal diameter (or length)  
3 A visible wart ≥ 6 mm in maximal diameter (or length)  
The physician is encouraged to use a ruler or caliper and to feel the wart or skin area to help his/her assessment.  
At Visit 1 for the subject to be enrolled and at Visit 2 for the subject to be randomized each identified 
wart must have a PWA grade ≥ 2. 
At Visits 3 -9, identified common warts  must have a PWA > 0 to be retreated. If the Investigator 
cannot assess the PWA for a common wart  (e.g., the common wart  cannot be visualized because of 
an LSR such as edema, scabbing, etc.) she/he must report the reason in the subject’s CRFs. The 
identified common wart  must not be retreated at that visit, and the subject should be seen at the next 
scheduled visit.  All at home treatment visits will be based on the PWA score during the in -office 
visit.   
Refer to Appendix  2 for the PWA Site Manual.   
12.4. Subject Instructions  
An investigational center staff member will dispense a Subject Instruction Sheet to each subject at Visit 1  (Refer to  Appendix  1). 
Throu ghout the study, the subjects should:

Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019  
 49  
    • Continue their routine cleansing regimen except they should avoid vigorous scrubbing of the 
identified common warts  (e.g., loofah, back brushes, scrubbing straps, abrasive washcloths, 
sponges and cleansing pads, etc.)  
• Continue their routine cosmetics and skin care products  
• Avoid exposing the identified common warts  to excessive natural or artificial ultraviolet radiation 
(e.g., sunlight, tanning beds) and use sunscreen on the common warts , if excessive exposure 
cannot b e avoided  
• Avoid activities that might irritate the common warts . 
• Avoid the use of self -tanning lotions and spray tans near the common warts . 
• Bring the subject instruction sheet  and subject diary  with them to each visit.  
• Follow all instructions for the proper application of the A -101 study medication when 
applying product at home. 
On study visit days, the subjects should:  
• Wear loose fitting clothing to the visit (Note: clothing that comes in contact with the study 
medication may be bleached)  
• Starting wit h Visit 2, not apply any topical products to the identified common wart  within 12 hours  
prior to the visit (Note: routine cleansing products are allowed)  
• After the completion of any study visit where a study medication treatment was performed DO 
NOT:  
o Wash/ submerge the treated common wart  for at least 6 hours  
o Apply any topical products to the treated common wart  for at least 6 hours . 
12.5. Parents/legal guardians of children must ensure that the child does not 
put the treated area in their mouth, or eyes, until completely dry after the application. If the treated area is not completely dry 10 minutes after the 
application, the area should be blotted dry. Other Study Supplies  
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. will provide:  
• An appropriate ruler, or other instrument, for meas uring of all common wart  dimensions ;  
• Supplies and instructions for collecting, labeling, shipping and result reporting for the clinical 
laboratory tests from ACM Laboratories ;

    13. ASSESMENT OF SAFETY 
In addition to reporting adverse events throughout the study the investigator, a designated and 
appropriately trained staff member or the subject, will perform the following safety assessments according to the schedules noted below . 
13.1. Local Skin Reactions (LSRs)  
The LSR assessment is the Investigator’s assessment of the signs and the subject’s assessment of the 
symptoms associated with irritation at the identified common wart  site ( i.e., the common wart  and the skin 
immediately surrounding the common wart  exposed to study medication). The Investigator may refer to 
previous photographs to assist with these assessments only AFTER the PWA has been performed.  
The Local Skin Reaction signs to be assessed are:  
• Erythema  
• Edema  
• Erosion  
• Ulceration  
• Vesicles/bullae  
• Excoriations  
• Scabbing  
The Local Skin Reaction symptoms to be assessed (by the Subject) are:  
• Stinging/burning  
• Pruritus (itch)  
At Visits 2 -13, the Investigator will evaluate the LSR signs  at the each identified common wart site  as 
follows:  
• At visits where a study medication treatment or retreatment is  performed:  
o Perform an LSR assessment prior to any study medication  application  
and 
At Visits 2 -13, the Subject will assess the LSR symptoms at the identi fied common wart site as follows:  
• At visits where a study medication treatment or retreatment is performed:  
o Perform an LSR assessment prior to any study medication application  
 
At visits where NO study medication treatment is  performed:

Local Skin Reactions  
Grade  Descriptor  
0 None ; No signs or symptoms present.  
1 Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention 
not indicated.  
2 Moderate ; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated.  
3 Severe  or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; disabling; limiting 
self-care of activities of daily living.  
13.2. Vital Signs 
Vital signs will be measured by a qualified staff member at Visit 1, Visit 9 and Visit 13 . The following 
items will be measured:  
• Body temperature ; 
• Heart  rate; 
• Respiration rate ; 
• Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) after the subject sits quietly for at least 5 minutes ; 
• Height (at Visit 1 only) ; 
• Weight (at Visit 1 only ); 
Any measure that is, in the opinion of the investigator, abnormal AND clinically significant  (CS 
must be recorded as history if found prior to the first study medication treatment or as an AE if 
found after the first study medication treatment begins . 
13.3. Clinical Laboratory Sampling  
Non-fasting blood samples for clinical laboratory analysis will be collected by a qualified staff 
member at Visit 1  and Visit 13. Approximately 7.5 mL of blood wil l be collected for each 
chemistry sample  and 3 ml of blood will be collected for each complete blood count (CBC). 
These blood samples will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis.  Refer to the study specific laboratory manual for instructions regarding handling of the blood samples and shi pping 
instructions. 
The following tests, at a minimum, will be conducted:  
 
Chemistry Panel  Complete Blood Count  
Albumin  Hematocrit

Sodium   
Total bilirubin   
Total protein   
Uric acid   
The results of the clinical laboratory tests will be reported on the central laboratory’s standard 
reports. These laboratory results will be sent to the investigator via fax.  The investigator must 
review all laboratory reports in a timely manner and note NC S or C S to define the clinical 
relevance of any result that is outside the normal range for the laboratory. The investigator must date and initial every laboratory report . 
The investigator must review the Visit 1 laboratory results for all the measured a nalytes for each 
subject prior to Visit 2. The subject must not be randomized at Visit 2 if any of the Visit 1 results are outside normal range for the laboratory AND, in the opinion of the investigator, C S. 
The investigator must report all laboratory results that are BOTH outside the normal range for the laboratory AND, in the opinion of the investigator, C S as medical history if found prior to the 
first study medication treatment or as an AE if found after the first study medication treatment begins . 
13.4. Demo graphics and Medical History  
At Visit 1, the investigator or designee will collect demographic information including date of birth, sex at birth , race and, if appropriate, ethnicity for each subject.

    At Visit 1, the investigator must determine each subject ’s Fitzpatrick skin type and document 
appropriately on the subject’s CRF.  
Table  4: Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scoring System  
Skin Type 
Classification  Description  
Type I  always burns, never tans (pale white; blond or red hair; 
blue eyes; freckles)  
Type II  usually burns, tans minimally (white; fair; blond or red 
hair; blue, green, or hazel eyes)  
Type III  sometimes mild burn, tans uniformly (cream white; fair 
with any hair or eye color)  
Type IV  burns minimally, always  tans well (moderate brown)  
Type V  very rarely burns, tans very easily (dark brown)  
Type VI  Never burns, never tans (deeply pigmented dark brown to 
darkest brown)  
(Fitzpatrick, TB, 1988 ) 
Medical history information will be recorded including all medical conditions and disease states that, at 
Visit 1:  
• Are ongoing 
• Require concomitant therapy  
Are, in the opinion of  the investigator, relevant to the subject’s study participation .

    14. ADVERSE EVENTS  
14.1. Definitions 
14.1.1. Adverse Events (AEs)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient that develops or worsens 
in severity during the conduct of a clinical st udy of a pharmaceutical product and does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug.  An adverse event can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study, or significant worsening of the disease under 
study (or any concurrent disease), whether or not considered related to the study drug.  
Accordingly, an adverse event could include any of the following : 
• intercurrent illnesses ; 
• physical injuries ; 
• events possibly related to concomitant medication ; 
• significant worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease under 
study or other pre -existing conditions.  (N
OTE: A condition, recorded as pre -existing, 
that is intermittently symptomatic [e.g., headache] and which occurs during the study 
should be recorded as an adverse event ); 
• Drug interactions; 
• Events occurring during diagnostic procedures or any washout phase of the study;  
• laboratory or diagnostic test abnorma lities occurring after the start of the study (i.e., 
after screening and once confirmed by repeat testing) that results in the withdrawal of the patient from the study, requires medical treatment or further diagnostic work -up, 
or is considered by the study  investigator to be clinically significant.  N
OTE: 
Abnormal laboratory test results at the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the study or receiving study treatment are not considered adverse events, but 
will be recorded to monitor data  from patients who do not meet screening criteria . 
Worsening of any of the identified common wart assessments should be reported as an 
AE ONLY if the use of the study medication is interrupted or discontinued or if therapy 
is required to manage the event . 
The investigator must, for any common wart  related AE, question the subject in detail 
to determine if there are any confounding factors ( e.g., irritation by clothing or activity, 
sunburn) for any such AE . 
The investigator should, when certain, report a diag nosis rather than the signs, symptoms or 
clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values associated with the AE. Otherwise, signs, symptoms or abnormal laboratory values may be used to describe the AE . 
Any C S abnormality discovered prior to the first study medication treatment should be 
reported as medical history, not as an AE . 
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.    
Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 
Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019  
 56  
    14.1.2. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
A Serious Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death ; 
• Is life threatening ; 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization ; 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or  
• Is an important medical event . 
 
The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the su bject was at risk of death at the time of 
event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.  
 
Inpatient hospitalization is considered to have occurred if the subject is admitted to the hospital on an in -
patient basis, even if released the same day. Prolongation of hospitalization is defined as an additional 
night stay in the hospital . Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre- existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE . 
 Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, result in death or 
hospitalization, but are clearly of major clinical significance and may jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the SAE definition above. These should also usually 
be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home 
for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization . 
 
14.1.3. Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The investigator must start reporting non- serious AEs starting with the subject’s first study 
medication tr eatment continuing until Visit 11 . Non -serious adverse events that occur between 
the time the subject was con sented and the first application of study medication will be reported 
as medical history . 
Reporting for SAEs begins after the subject signs the informed consent and continues until Visit 
11 (regardless of relationship to study medication).  If a subject  experiences a SAE after Visit 11 
that is deemed by the investigator to be related to study medication, the investigator must report this to the Sponsor using the study specific SAE report form . 
14.1.4. Severity  
The investigator must define the severity of each AE us ing the following definitions as a 
guideline. The investigator will consider the range of the possible severity of the event and identify the severity that is the most appropriate according to her/his medical judgment.  
Mild  – Awareness of signs or symptom,  but easily tolerated  
Moderate  – Discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity  
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.    
Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 
Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019  
 57  
    Severe – Incapacitating with inability to perform usual activity . 
14.1.5. Relationship to Study Medication 
The investigator will determine if there is a reasonable causal relationship between the study 
medication and an AE or not. The investigator will use her/his best medical judgment and consider all relevant factors ( e.g., temporal relationship, location of the event, the subject’s 
relevant medical history, concomitant therapies and concurrent conditions) to determine the relationship of the AE to the study medication. The investigator will define the relationship of an AE to the study medication by selecting one of the following categories . 
Related  – There is a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the study 
medication and the AE.  
Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship 
between the study medication and the AE . 
The term “reasonab le causal relationship” means there are facts or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship (International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E2A . 
14.2. Reporting Procedures  
14.2.1. Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events  
At each post enrollment visit, the investigator or designee will question the subject to elicit AEs using a non- directive question such as “Has there been any change in your health since the 
previous study visit?”   
The Investigator/designee will monitor t he subject for at least 20 minutes after the Treatment 
Completion Time at any visit during which a study medication treatment is performed to elicit AEs in a similar manner . 
If appropriate, based on the subject’s response to non- directed questioning regarding AEs, the 
investigator or designee will follow -up with directed questions and appropriate evaluations . 
Any AE noted during the reporting period must be reported in the source documents and on the appropriate AE CRF . 
AEs that are defined as “Not Related” to the study medications will be followed until they are resolved or until the subject’s last study visit. AEs that are defined as “Related” to the study 
medications will be followed until they are resolved or, if not resolved after the subject’s last 
study visit, until in the opinion of the investigator, the AE reaches a clinically stable outcome 
with or without sequelae . 
14.2.2. Procedure for Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Upon becoming aware of a SAE occurring during the AE reporting period, whether or not re lated 
to the study medications, the investigator must:  
1. 
Take the appropriate medical action to ensure the subject’s safety  
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.    
Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 
Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019  
 58  
    2. Immediately inform  Aclaris of the SAE:  
Serious Adverse Event Facsimile:  484 -324-2359  
 
3. Within 24- hours of becoming aware of the event, a SAE report form, an AE CRF and any other 
relevant information ( e.g., concomitant medication CRF, medical history CRF, laboratory test 
results) must be faxed to the SAE Fax line listed above. 
4. Monitor and document the progre ss of the SAE until it resolves or, if not resolved after the subject’s 
last study visit, until in the opinion of the investigator the AE reaches a clinically stable outcome 
with or without sequelae AND the investigator and Drug Safety Monitor  agree that t he SAE is 
satisfactorily resolved.  
5. Inform the Drug Safety Monitor  of SAE updates by telephone followed by an SAE form update sent 
by fax or by e -mail.  
Comply with the appropriate regulatory requirements and Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. instructions 
regarding  reporting of the SAE to the responsible Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics 
Committee (EC) . 
14.2.3. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event  
Any patient who experiences an adverse event may be withdrawn from study drug at any time at the discretion of the invest igator.  If a patient is withdrawn wholly or in part because of an 
adverse event, both the adverse events page and termination page of the CRF will be completed at that time.  The patient will be monitored until the event has resolved or stabilized, until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is made, or until the 
patient is referred to the care of a local health care professional.  The investigator must inform 
the medical monitor as soon as possible of all patients who a re being considered for withdrawal 
due to adverse events.  Additional reports must be provided when requested .

    15. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Sample Size and Power Considerations  
 Based on efficacy results from study A -101-WART -203 with the same active study medication 
and treatment plan specified in the current protocol for a comparable patient population and 
indication, an overall per -wart clearance rate of at least 26% for Active compared with 9% for 
Vehicle is anticipated.  Assuming a distribution of  treated warts per subject comparable to the 
Phase 2 study results, statistical modeling provided a forecast of an advantage in subject responder rates  (all treated warts with PWA= 0) for Active over Vehicle groups of at least 11 
percentage points.  This le ads to a required sample size for the current study of approximately 
500 subjects to provide greater than 90% power to achieve statistical significance in the primary efficacy analysis . This projection tak es into account the impact  of the anticipated  subje ct dropout 
rate on power for the primary efficacy analysis, based on the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population 
and planned missing data imputation procedures.  
Additionally, a simulation was conducted in a manner that accounted for the distribution of 
multiple warts, the treatment effect in clearance between the different warts and the correlation in wart clearance among multiple warts.  Specific details of the s imulation are described in the 
SAP.  Results of this simulation indicate that data from 500 subjects (250 per group) will provide 
97% power to demonstrate the superiority of 45% A -101 topical solution over vehicle for the 
primary endpoint.  
15.2. Analysis of Popu lations 
The populations used for analyses will be defined as follows:  
• Intent -to-Treat Population (ITT): The ITT population includes all randomized subjects.  
• Per-Protocol Population (PP):  The PP Population includes all subjects who received at 
least one application of study medication and have no major protocol violations. 
• Safety Population: The Safety population includes all subjects who received at least one application of study medication. 
15.3. Statistical Analysis of Efficacy  
The ITT population will be used for primary and secondary efficacy analyses and summaries.  
The ITT population is defined as all subjects randomized to the study and analyzed as 
randomized.  The Per -Protocol (PP) population will be used for sensitivity analyses for the 
primary efficacy analysis an d all secondary efficacy analyses included in the hierarchical testing 
procedure.   Details on all analyses discussed below will be provided in the study Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).  
The primary efficacy analysis will be a treatment compari son of A -101 45% compared to 
Vehicle at Visit 10 (Day 60).  It will be based on the proportion of subjects who achieve 
complete clearance (PWA=0) of all identified common warts.  A Cochran Mantel Haenszel 
(CMH) test stratified by the baseline number of tre ated warts will be used to perform the primary 
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.    
Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 
Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019  
 60  
    efficacy comparison between treatment groups, with 2- tail alpha set at 0.05.  The analysis will be 
based on the ITT population.  Any identified common wart for a randomized subject that has 
missing data at the  endpoint visit will be treated as not Clear for the purpose of the primary 
efficacy analysis.   
The first sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint will be an analysis based upon the PP 
population.  This analysis will use the same CMH model described for the primary analysis.   A 
second  sensitivity analysis will be conducted  for the primary endpoint using the same CMH 
model  for the ITT  population that includes  the imputation of missing PWA data using a fully 
conditionally specified (FCS) regression -based Multiple Imputation (MI) procedure . To assess 
the impact of missing data imputation on the primary analysis results a tipping point analysis will 
be conducted.  This analysis will shift the treatment coefficient in the regression model use d in 
the MI procedure to impose a worse mean maximum PWA for the A -101 45% arm and a better 
mean maximum PWA for the vehicle arm.   Details of this tipping point analysis will be specified 
in the SAP.  In addition, a model similar to the primary analysis mo del but stratified instead by 
Study Center will be performed as a sensitivity analysis including a Breslow -Day test to evaluate 
heterogeneity across sites.   
Four  secondary efficacy analyses will be performed and tested in a hierarchical Fixed -Sequence ste p-
down method  to control alpha among secondary efficacy variables .  The predefined order of the tests is 
specified to be the order of these analyses as presented below.  All analyses will be conducted at the 
same alpha level ( 2-tail alpha = 0.05).  The res ults of the second analysis will only be reported if the first 
analysis reaches statistical significance at alpha = 0.05.  The results of the third analysis will only be 
reported if the first and second analyses reach statistical significance, each at alph a = 0.05.  The results 
of the fourth analysis will only be reported if the first, second and third analyses reach statistical 
significance , each at alpha = 0.05.  Each of the analys es will focus on the outcome of identified common 
warts at specified time p oints.   
The first secondary analysis will evaluate the effectiveness of A -101 45% compared to Vehicle at Visit 13 
(Day 137).  It will be based on the proportion of subjects who achieve complete clearance (PWA=0) of all 
identified common warts.  A Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test identical to the primary efficacy 
analysis model and stratified by the number of treated warts at baseline will be used to perform the 
comparison between treatment groups, with 2 -tail alpha set at 0.05.  Any randomized subject wi th 
missing data at the Day 137 visit will be treated as not Clear for the purpose of this secondary efficacy 
analysis. Sensitivity analyses specified for the primary efficacy analysis will also be performed for this 
efficacy time point, including missing d ata imputation impact analyses, the tipping point analysis, and  
the site heterogeneity analysis.       
The second  secondary efficacy analysis will be based on a comparison between A -101 45% and 
Vehicle of the mean per -subject percent of treated warts that are Clear  (PWA=0)  at Visit 13 (Day 
137), using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with 2- tail alpha set at 0.05. 
The third secondary efficacy analysis will be a comparison between A -101 45% and Vehicle of 
the proportion of subjects with a single wa rt at baseline, whose wart is Clear (PWA=0)  at Visit 
10, using a CMH test stratified by investigator site, with 2 -tail alpha set at 0.05 .

Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 
Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019  
 61  
    The fourth  secondary efficacy analysis will a comparison between A -101 45% and Vehicle s 
with respect to the median time to achieve onset  of Clearance (PWA=0)  for all treated warts .  It 
will be conducted as a comparison of median time for a subject to first achieve C learance 
(PWA=0) of all treated warts , using a log rank test  with 2 -tail alpha set at 0.05 .  This will be a  
Kaplan -Meier time -to-event analysis  providing  standard survivor functions and comparisons of 
time-to-event curves using the log rank test , where time -to-event  curves will be compared with 
two-tail alpha = 0.05, and median time to event will be presented f or each treatment group. For 
each subject t he time to achieve onset of complete treated wart Clearance will be calculated from 
the date of randomization to the earliest visit date when all treated warts are clear.  In the event a 
subject does not attain co mplete wart Clearance, that subject’s time -to-event data will be treated 
as censored for the Kaplan -Meier analysis.    
15.4. Statistical Analysis of Safety Data  
Descriptive statistics will be calculated on the safety parameters using the Safety  Population and using 
actual treatment received . The proportion of subjects with treatment -emergent adverse events will be 
tabulated and presented by treatment and Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
System Organ Class. Vital signs, LSR sco res and clinically relevant abnormal laboratory results will also be 
tabulated and presented by study medication. No inferential testing will be performed.  
 
 Safety summaries by study medication group will include listings by study medication of adverse ev ents 
incidences within each MedDRA System Organ Class, and changes from  pre-application values in vital 
signs. Adverse event summaries will be presented by  study medication showing the proportion of 
subjects experiencing adverse events, both  overall and by  MedDRA System Organ Class.   The version of 
MedDRA to be used for the analysis of this study will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

    16. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
16.1. Protocol Amendments 
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opinion of a written amendment by the IRB /EC, except when necessary to 
eliminate immediate safety concerns to the  study subjects  or when the change involves only 
logistics or administration.  The principal investigator and the sponsor will sign the protocol amendment . 
16.2. Protocol Violations 
A protocol violation  is defined as any divergence from the protocol -specif ic inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, subject is administered a prohibited medication , and/or GCP guidelines .  Protocol 
violations will be identified and recorded, by study center personnel, on the CRF . 
As a matter of policy, sponsor/CRO will not grant exceptions  to protocol -specific entry criteria 
to allow patients to enter a study.  If under extraordinary circumstances such action is considered ethically, medically, and scientifically justified for a particular patient, prior approval from sponsor/CRO and the responsible IRB/IEC, in accordance with the Sponsor/CROs Standard 
Operating Procedure (SOP), is required before the patient will be allowed to enter the study.  If 
investigative center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol eligib ility criteria 
was entered in a study (a protocol violation), they must immediately inform sponsor/CRO.  Such 
subjects  will be discontinued from the study, except in a rare instance following review and 
written approval by sponsor/CRO and the responsible I RB/IEC, according to the applicable SOP . 
16.3. Training  
For each investigational center, there will be an initiation visit prior to enrolling any study 
subjects . 
It is strongly recommended that all investigators, other evaluators, study nurses, study coordinator s or other applicable personnel attend this visit.  During this visit, participants will be 
trained to the protocol, study specific procedures, and the CRFs.  Those unable to attend the initiation visit must receive on -site training from an appropriately trained individual prior to 
participating in any of the procedures and evaluations in this study . 
Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) and other applicable personnel will be trained prior to study initiation to familiarize CRAs with the disease, the Standard  Operating Procedures (SOPs), 
the protocol and other study specific items.  Team organization, communication and operational issues will also be discussed . 
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. will provide an investigational center file to each center . 
16.4. Monitoring  
The conduct of the study will be closely monitored by the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. study 
monitor /CRO to verify adherence to ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, applicable SOPs, the protocol, other written instructions and regulatory guidelines . 
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.    
Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 
Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019  
 63  
    The investigator will allow the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. representatives designee and/or and 
any regulatory agency to have direct access to all study records, CRFs, corresponding subject 
medical records, study medication dispensing records and study medic ation storage area, and any 
other documents considered source documentation.  The investigator also agrees to assist the representative, if required . 
16.5. Data Management  
Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically designed for this study.  The data  
collected on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management system (CDMS) that meets the technical requirements described in US 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 11.  The 
CDMS will be fully validated to ensure that it meets the scientific , regulatory, and logistical 
requirements of the study before it is used to capture data from this study.  Before using the 
CDMS, all users will receive training on the system and study specific training.  After they are trained, users will be provided wit h individual system access rights . 
The handling of data, including data quality assurance, will comply with regulatory guidelines, including ICH and GCP, and the sponsor/CRO SOPs and working instructions.  Data 
management and control processes specific to this study will be described in a data management 
plan.    At the end of the study, the database will be locked and the data will be released for  
reporting and statistical analysis . 
16.6. Quality Assurance  
The study is conducted under the sponsorship of Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. in compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements as well as applicable ICH guidelines, Helsinki Declaration, and in respect of the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. and/or sub- contractor SOPs for study 
conduct and monitoring . 
Audits ma y be carried out by the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. or Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.’s 
representatives and inspections may be performed by regulatory authorities or IRB/ECs before, 
during or after the study.  The investigator will provide the auditing/inspecti ng group direct 
access to all study records ( e.g., CRFs, subject medical records, study medication dispensing 
records) and the investigational center study facilities. The investigator and study staff will be 
available and will assist the auditing/inspecting groups as appropriate . 
16.7. Record Retention  
All pertinent data, samples, photographs, correspondence, original or amended protocol, reports and all other material relating to the study will be maintained securely in Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc./CRO /investigator archives for the legally required duration for archiving . 
The investigator should maintain the essential study documents as specified in ICH GCP, and in compliance with all regulatory requirements. The investigator should ensure these documents are protected from accidental destruction or disposal . 
If the Investigator needs to re -assign responsibility for maintaining these documents ( e.g., due to 
retirement) it must be transferred to a person willing to accept this responsibility.  The 
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.    
Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 
Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019  
 64  
    investi gator must notify Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc., in writing, of the name and address of the 
new individual . 
If the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigative site for any or 
all of the documents, special arrangements must be  made between the Investigator and the 
Sponsor to store these in sealed containers in an off -site storage location so that they can be 
returned to the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit.  Where source documents are required for the continued care of the patient, appropriate copies will be made for off -site storage .  
No trial document should be destroyed without prior written agreement between the Sponsor and the Investigator. Should the Investigator wish to assign the trial records to another party or move them to another location, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor in writing of the new responsible person and/or the new location.

 To define an appropriate NI -0501 therapeutic dose regimen for 
HLH.  
 To assess the immunogenicity of NI -0501.  
Study Population:   Primary HLH patients . 
 Patients can be naïve to HLH treatment  (first line  patients ), or may 
have already rec eived conventional HLH therapy  (second line  
patients ) without having obtain ed a satisfact ory response according 
to the treating physician or having shown signs of intolerance to it .

Study Drug : 
 
Dosing Regimen  & Frequency of 
of Administration:  
  NI-0501 is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
directed against human IFNγ.  
 NI-0501 will be administered by IV infusion over a period of one 
hour at an initial dose of 1 mg/kg.  
 Infusions will be performed  every 3 days  until S tudy Day 15 
(SD15)  (infusion #6), and twice per week thereafter . 
 NI-0501 dose increase  to 3 mg/kg will be possible according to 
pre-defined criteria guided  by clinical and laboratory respons e in 
each patient  (see Table 4, protocol  section  5.2.2 ) at any time during 
the study .  
 After a minimum of two infusions at 3 mg/kg if , upon re -
assessment , the same clinical and laboratory criteria qualifying the 
patient to receive 3 mg/kg of NI -0501 are found to still apply,  the 
dose of NI-0501 may be increased to 6 mg/kg for up to  four 
infusions , with a regular monitoring of the clinical and laboratory 
HLH parameters .  
 Based on the evolution  of these parameters , the dose of NI-0501 
may either i) be decreased back to 3 mg/kg , or ii) remain at 6 
mg/kg for additional infusions  (or be increased above 6 mg/kg) , if 
PK and PD evidence  indicates excessively high IFN  production 
and, consequently, fast NI -0501 elimination (see Appendix B ). 
 Dose increase may occur any time during the study, if the clinical 
and laboratory criteria in Table 4 are met .   
Treatment Duration:   NI-0501 administration is foreseen for 8 weeks . After this  time 
period,  the conditioning regimen in preparation for  Hematopoietic 
Stem Cell T ransplantation  (HSCT) might be initiated . 
 The anticipated duration of treatment can be shortened, although 
not to less than 4 weeks, if the patient’s condition an d donor 
availability allow  the performance of  a transplant . 
 In the event that an appropriate donor has not been identified by 
Week 8 or in case of the need to delay the schedule for

0501, NI -0501 treatment can be continued, upon the request of the 
Investigator , in the context of the long-term follow -up study NI-
0501 -05, provided that a favorable  benefit/risk has been 
established  for the patient . 
Background Therapy & 
Concomitant Medication:   NI-0501 will be administered on a background of dexamethasone , 
which can be tapered depending on patient condition .  
 Patients will receive prophylactic treatment for Pneumocystis 
jiroveci , fungal  and Herpes Zoster  virus infection  from the day 
before initiat ion of NI -0501 treatment until the end of the study .  
 Cyclosporin A (CsA) can be continued if already being 
administered to the patient prior to screening . CsA can be 
withdrawn at any time, upon judgment of the Investigator. C sA is 
not to be introduced de novo  during the course of the study once 
NI-0501 administration has started.  
 If the patient is receiving intrathecal methotrexate and 
glucocorticoids  at the time of NI -0501 treatment initiation, this 
treatment will be continued as required.  
 IV immunoglobu lins (IVIG) are only allowed as replacement  
treatment in case of a documented immunoglobulin deficiency .  
 Analgesic treatment, transfusion of blood products, electrolyte and 
glucose infusions, antibiotics, anti -fungal and anti -viral treatment 
and general s upportive care are allowed.  
 Vaccination with a live or attenuated (including BCG)  vaccine 
must  be avoided during the whole study including the 4 week 
follow -up period.  
 Additional HLH treatments may be allowed in case of unsustained 
or limited HLH improveme nt once  the maximum NI -0501 dose 
level  is achieved.  
- Unsustained HLH Improvement: Patients who are unable to 
maintain at least 50% improvement from baseline for 3 HLH 
parameters (see Table 1). At least two consecutive measurements 
must document the loss of HLH improvement.  
- Limited HLH Improvement: Less than 50% change from baseline 
in a minimum of 3 HLH clinical and laboratory criteria . 
Etoposide should be administered as additional HLH treatment, 
unless clear evidence of lack of response or intolerance to t he 
drug is derived from previous medical history.   
In this circumstance, the Investigator may propose an alternative 
agent which requires to be approved by t he Data Monitoring 
Committee .   
Sample Size:   Sample size is estimated for the pivotal cohort of th e study, i.e. 
patients receiving NI -0501 in second line.  
 A minimum of 28 evaluable second line patients will be enrolled in 
the study. Sample size calculation is based on the primary efficacy 
endpoint of “Overall Response Rate”. Assuming an Overall 
Respons e Rate of 70%, the study will have 90% power to show a 
significant improvement above 40% using a n exact binomial  test at 
a one-sided significance level of 2.5%.

Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL Number of Sites and 
Recruitment Duration:   It is estimated that in the US  approximately 8 sites will participate 
in this study. The time needed  to complete enrolment  of the 
required number of second line patient s, in this rare population, is 
estimated to be approximately  1 year.  
 A twin protocol is actively recruiting in European countries. The 
recru itment will be competitive across all US and European sites.   
Study Duration and Study 
End Definition:    After the treatment period, or, in any case, at treatment 
discontinuation, patients will enter a follow -up period of 4 weeks 
(short -term follow -up). 
 End of the study is defined as last patient last visit.  
 A separate long -term follow -up study (NI -0501 -05) will enroll  all 
patients who will have received at least one dose of NI -0501  and 
signed informed consent .  
Study Safety Monitoring   
and Stopping Rule s:  An independent  Data Monitoring Committee (DM C) composed of 
relevant Experts (pediatric onco -hematologists, pediatric immun e 
deficiency/infectious disease specialists, a bio -statistician and a 
specialist in ethics) will oversee the study conduct, reviewi ng data 
generated both in the US and in Europe.  
 The main DMC responsibility is to review all safety and relevant 
efficacy data as they are generated on an on -going basis , with the 
objective of determining the benefit/risk profile of NI -0501 
treatment for HLH patients  and ensuring that no patient is exposed 
to unnecessary risks.  
 The DMC can recommend treatment discontinuation for individual 
patients as well as temporarily or permanently stopping the entire 
study. Predefined stopping rules will guide the DMC ’s review 
process.  
 Patients withdrawn from the study will receive rescue therapy, 
according to the standard of care at the site.  
 A patient, his/her representative or the Investigator can decide at 
any time to withdraw  a patient  from the study. This decisi on will 
have no impact on the patient’s care.   
Efficacy Endpoints : Evolution of clinical signs (fever, splenomegaly, CNS symptoms) and 
laboratory parameters (CBC, fibrinogen, ferritin, sCD25 levels), which 
characterize the disease, will be used to assess the achievement of 
response and time to response . 
Primary efficacy endpoint:  
 Overall Response Rate, i.e. achievement of either Complete or 
Partial Response or HLH Improvement , at End of Treatment  
(EoT) , as defined in Table 1. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints:  
 Time to Response  any time during the study  
 Durability of Response, i.e.  maintenance of response achieved any 
time during the study until EoT and beyond (including data 
collected in the long -term follow -up study NI -0501 -05). 
 Number of patients able to redu ce glucocorticoid s by 50%  or more 
of baseline dose .

Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL  Number of patients able to proceed to HSCT , when deemed 
indicated . 
 Survival at Week 8 (or EoT) and at the end of the study Long -
term survival (in particular D+30 and D+100 post -HSCT survival) 
will be as sessed in the context of long-term study NI -0501 -05. 
 Serum  concentration of NI -0501 to determine NI -0501 
pharmacokinetic ( PK) profile . 
 Determination of pharmacodynamic (PD)  effects  (levels of 
circulating total IFNγ and  markers of its neutralization, namel y 
CXCL9 and CXCL10 ). 
 Determination of other biomarkers, e.g. sCD25, IL -10.  
Safety Endpoints :  
 
  Safety parameters to be collected and assessed:  
- Incidence, severity, causality and outcomes of Adverse Events 
(serious and non -serious), with particular atten tion being paid to 
infections . 
- Evolution of laboratory parameters such as complete blood cell 
count (CBC), with a focus on red cells (hemoglobin), 
neutrophils and platelets, liver tests, renal function tests and 
coagulation . 
- Number of patients withdrawn fo r safety reasons . 
 Other parameters:  
- Level (if any) of circulating antibodies against NI -0501 to 
determine immunogenicity (ADA) . 
Statistical Analysis:   The primary endpoint Overall Response Rate will be evaluated 
using the exact binomial test at the one -sided 0.025 level.   
 Time to Response, durability of Response and Survival time will 
be presented using Kaplan -Meier curves with medians calculated if 
available. 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the 
median for each of these endpoints.  
 Additiona l endpoints based on binary outcomes including number 
of patients who reduce glucocorticoid s by 50% or more, and 
number of patients able to proceed to HSCT  will be converted to 
proportions and associated 95% confidence intervals calculated.  
 Statistical si gnificance in terms of p -values will only be obtained 
for the primary endpoint. All other endpoints will be viewed as 
supportive for the primary endpoint and as a consequence no 
formal hierarchy of endpoints will be declared.

Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL Table 1 : Definition of response  
Overall Response Rate  
Complete Response  Complete Response is adjudicated if : 
- No fever = body temperature < 37.5 C 
- Normal spleen size as measured by 3D abdominal ultrasound  
- No cytopenia = Absolute Neutrophil Counts  1.0x109/L and platelet count  
100x109/L absence of G -CSF and transfusion support must be documented for at 
least 4 days to report no cytopenia  
- No hyperferritinemia = serum level is  < 2000 g/L   
- No evidence of coagulopathy , i.e. normal D -Dimer and/or normal ( > 150 mg/dL) 
fibrinogen levels  
- No neurological  and CSF abnormalities attribut ed to HLH  
- No sustained worsening of sCD25 ( as indicated by at least two consecutive 
measurements that are > 2 -fold higher than baseline)  
Partial Response  Partial Response is ad judicated if : 
- At least 3  of the  HLH clinical and laboratory abnormalities  (including CNS 
abnormalities) meet  the above mentioned  criteria  for “ Complete Response”. In 
the case of “reactivated patients” who enter the study with 3 abnormal HLH 
features , at le ast 2 criteria should meet the definition given  
- There is n o progression of other aspects of HLH disease pathology ( e.g., 
jaundice, liver size, oedema , CNS clinical alterations ) 
HLH improvement  - Improvement (>50% change from baseline ) of at least 3 HLH clinical and 
laboratory abnormalities  (including CNS involvement).  In the case of “reactivated 
patients” who enter the study with 2 abnormal HLH features , a change from 
baseline greater than  50% for both will define  HLH as improved . 
Limited Improvement/ Lack of Improvement/No Response  
- Less than  50% change from baseline of 3 or more of the above mentioned HLH clinical and laboratory 
abnormalities  in the case of “reactivated patients” who enter the study with 2 abnormal HLH features , less 
than 50% change from baseline in both will be sufficient to define limited improvement  
and 
- No apparent improvement in other aspects of disease pathology  
Reactivation  
- Deterioration of two or more HLH d clinical and laboratory criteria with the following specifications:  
1. numer ical laboratory values* must become abnormal and worsen by more than 30% compared to the 
previous evaluation, on two sequential assessments performed with an interval of minimum 1 day and 
maximum 1 week  
2. deterioration of clinical criteria must be confirmed by consistent observations of worsening over three 
consecutive days  
- The development of new or recurrent CNS symptoms counts as a single criterion for reactivation.  
* The following laboratory parameters  are specifically considered for determination of reactivation:  
- platelets  
- neutrophils  
- fibrinogen  
- ferritin  
- soluble CD25 (sCD25; i.e. soluble IL -2 receptor) . 
The assessment of NK function, red blood cells/hemoglobin and triglyceride levels cannot be considered for the 
determination of reactivation .

Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL PART I   
1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
1.1 NI-0501 
1.1.1 Description and mode of action 
NI-0501 is a fully human IgG1 anti-interferon gamma (IFNγ) monoclonal antibody (mAb) which binds 
and neutralizes IFNγ. NI-0501 binds to soluble and receptor (IFNγR1)-bound forms of IFNγ.  
Since NI-0501 is a human IgG1, it retains the characteristics of this immunoglobulin isotype, including 
the capacity to engage Fcγ receptors and bind complement.  
IFNγ is one of the most potent and pleiotropic cytokines of the immune system. It is critical for innate  
and adaptive immunity  against viral and intracellular bacterial infections.  
After binding to its receptor, IFNγ acts to produce a variety of physiological and cellular responses. 
Numerous studies over the last 20 years have associated IFN  with the pathogenesis and the maintenance 
of inflammatory diseases1-3. 
IFNγ is produced predominantly by natural killer ( NK) and natural killer T ( NKT ) cells, as part of the 
innate immune response, and by CD4  Th1 and CD8  cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) effector T cells, once 
antigen -specific immunity develops. 
1.1.2 Preclinical Data  
1.1.2.1  Non-clinical Pharmacology 
NI-0501 has shown similar binding affinity and blocking activity for IFNγ from non-human species, 
including Rhesus and Cynomolgus monkeys, but not from dogs, cats, pigs, rabb its, rats or mice.  
Due to NI-0501 capacity to bind free and IFNγR1-bound IFNγ, studies were performed to investigate the 
potential of NI-0501 to mediate ADCC and CDC activities, in the presence of target. A lack of ADCC 
activity was demonstrated and no induction of CDC activity was observed.  
1.1.2.2  Toxicology 
Binding and functional data demonstrated Rhesus  or Cynomolgus  monkeys to be relevant species to 
evaluate the safety of NI-0501. No off-target toxicity was attributed to the drug when administered to 
Cynomolgus  monkeys in 13 weekly doses of up to 200 mg/kg. An enhanced susceptibility to infections 
due to the pharmacological effect of the drug was observed at all dose levels (10 to 200 mg/kg/week) in 
animals originally harboring gastrointestinal pathogens ( Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter ) prior to 
NI-0501 administration. In a study where Cynomolgus  monkeys were not initially found to be harboring 
gastrointestinal pathogens, weekly administrations of NI-0501 for 8 consecutive weeks at doses up to 30 
mg/kg were well tolerated, without the need for antibiotic prophylaxis.  
Results from a human tissue cross-reactivity study, involving a panel of 35 different human tissues, 
demonstrated that NI-0501 did not cross-react with any of the human samples tested. 
1.1.2.3  Safety pharmacology 
There were no abnormal findings in ECGs taken periodically during treatment and recovery periods in 
the 8 week and 13 week repeated dose toxicology studies in Cynomologus  monkeys, where animals were 
exposed to doses up to 200 mg/kg of NI-0501 weekly. No abnormal findings were observed in the 
Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 20 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL histopathological investigations of the hearts and lungs in these animals compared to untreated animals. 
Histopathological analysis of kidneys from these animals revealed no abnormal findings and the periodic 
urinalysis readings were also normal, indicating no abnormal effects on renal function. There were no 
histopathological findings in brains in both studies. Furthermore, no abnormal behavior of the animals 
was observed throughout the study periods, suggesting no effects on CNS.  
1.1.3 Clinical Data 
A Phase 1 randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled single ascending dose study in 20 healthy adult 
volunteers investigating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profiles of single intravenous (IV) 
administrations of NI-0501 took place between September 2011 and April 2012 . During this study 6 
subjects  received placebo , while 3, 3, 4, and 4 subjects (in total 14 subjects) received NI -0501  doses of  
0.01, 0.1, 1, and 3 mg/kg , respectively . 
The PK analysis of NI-0501 revealed the expected profile for an IgG1 with a long half-life (around 22 
days), a slow clearance (≤ 0.007 L/h) and a low volume of distribution (< 6 L on average). 
A total of 41 adverse events (AEs) were observed after start of drug infusion in 14 out of 20 subjects 
(70%), 10 of which were reported by 4 subjects having received placebo. Thirty-six (87.8%) AEs were of 
mild intensity and 5 (12.2%) were of moderate intensity. No severe or life-threatening AEs were 
reported. Twenty-three AEs (56.1%) in 10 of the 14 subjects who experienced an AE were reported as 
drug-related (at least with a reasonable possibility). Most AEs were singular occurrences and no trend in 
relation to increasing NI-0501 dosage was observed. 
All NI-0501 infusions were uneventful. 
Among the AEs reported during the 24 hours post infusion, chills (1 in the 1 mg/kg cohort), myalgia (1 in 
the 3 mg/kg cohort) and pyrexia (3 in the 1 mg/kg cohort) were reported. These symptoms were assessed 
as mild, except one assessed as moderate (temperature increase up to 38.4°C [101.1°F], treated by 
paracetamol administration) and were concomitant to transient laboratory changes (CRP and neutrophil 
elevation) and some slight cytokine variations. These observations at the higher doses of NI-0501 
administration suggest an attempt by the immune system to adjust to a new homeostasis upon IFNγ 
abrogation. They appear to be consistent with the mild flu-like symptoms reported with another IFNγ 
neutralizing antibody (Fontolizumab), after its first administration in Crohn’s disease patients4;5. 
Commonly reported infections such as upper respiratory tract infections were observed after 
administration of NI-0501, with a similar incidence reported in subjects who had received placebo.  
A Herpes Zoster (HZ)  infection was also reported in one subject (male, aged 26), 14 days after his 
infusion of 3 mg/kg of NI-0501. This event was assessed as related to the NI-0501 infusion and 
considered as serious (medically significant) in the context of a Phase I study in healthy volunteers 
(HVs). Its intensity was moderate and its course normal under antiviral therapy. The subject recovered 
with no sequelae.  
The occurrence of an HZ infection in a subject who has received a dose of NI-0501 intended to fully 
neutralize IFNγ can be attributed to the expected pharmacological effect of the drug. An increased 
susceptibility to HZ infections in patients having developed auto-antibodies against IFNγ6 or having 
receiv ed ustekinumab ( a mAb which decreases IFNγ production by inhibiting the p40 subunit of IL-12 ) 
has been described in the literature. HZ infection is reported in the ustekinumab USPI with a frequency 
rate less than 1% in controlled clinical studies. However, the subject who suffer ed from the HZ infection 
also exhibited unexplained elevated serum IgE levels prior to inclusion in, and during, the study. A non-
detectable subtle defect in the immune system linked to the elevated IgE levels may have increased the 
susceptibility of this subject to the pharmacological effect of NI-0501. 
Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 21 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL A blood sample was taken pre-infusion and at Week 8 for anti-drug antibody (ADA) detection. All 
samples were reported as negative for the presence of anti- NI-0501 antibodies. As in a few subjects NI-
0501 levels were still detectable at Week 8, additional samples at follow-up monthly visits were taken . 
The presence of ADA was found in one subject (having received 1 mg/kg) at Week 28, not affecting PK.  
In conclusion, the infusion of NI-0501 was well tolerated and the effects observed during the 8 week 
monitoring after drug infusion did not reveal any serious or unexpected off-target safety or 
immunogenicity concerns. Therefore, neither the clinical features and laboratory results, nor the PK 
profile and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects observed after administration of NI-0501 in HVs prevent 
moving NI-0501 into the next development phase. 
At the cut-off date of January 31st 2016, seventeen patients with confirmed or suspected primary HLH 
have been enrolled in the present NI-0501-04 study (8 in US, 9 in EU). Two patients received NI -0501 as 
a first-line treatment and 1 5 patients received NI -0501 as a second -line treatment because of an

1.2 HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS (HLH) 
HLH is a syndrome characterized by a severe impairment or absence of cytotoxic function by NK and 
CD8+ T cells with striking activation of the immune system. 
HLH comprises primary (genetic/familial) HLH and secondary HLH, both clinically described by a 
dysregulation of the immune system leading to a profound hypercytokinemia with deleterious 
consequences on various tissues and organs7. 
Primary HLH is a heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder. Primary HLH is mostly seen in infancy 
and early childhood with an estimated prevalence in Europe of 1/50,000 live births8. The disease is 
invariably fatal with a median survival of less than 2 months after onset of symptoms, if untreated9;10.  
 The impaired cytotoxic function present in HLH leads to hypercytokinemia and hemophagocytosis. 
These in turn cause all the typical symptoms of HLH11-13. 
 Prolonged fever 
 Splenomegaly 
 Cytopenia 
 Hyperferritinemia 
 Hypertriglyceridemia 
 Hypofibrinogenemia 
 Lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, bone marrow hypoplasia, meningeal infiltrate. 
Among the cytokines elevated in HLH patients are: IFNγ, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF) α, IL-8, macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-
stimulating factor (GM-CSF).  
HLH can also occur during the course of an infection, a rheumatic or a neoplastic disease and in this case 
it is referred to as secondary HLH. Secondary HLH presents with the same signs and symptoms of 
primary forms and can be equally severe. The current treatment of secondary HLH is aimed at addressing 
the cause of the underlying disease. This is certainly the case for HLH caused by infections such as 
Leishmaniasis. Of note, the presence of certain infections, in particular viral infections such as those due 
to CMV or EBV, is very often the trigger for the manifestation of primary forms of HLH. This 
Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 22 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL observation is also supported by the evidence that in animal models of primary HLH14-17, infection with 
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is required for the development of the disease.  
When HLH manifests during a neoplastic disease, in particular an hematological malignancy, often the 
severity of the patient condition requires the immediate treatment of HLH, prior to specifically addressing 
the underlying disease.   
The presence of signs and symptoms of HLH in patients suffering from a rheumatic disease, such as 
systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE), is often referred 
to by rheumatologists as Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) and can precede the appearance of the 
rheumatic disease itself. The majority of patients with MAS have impaired NK and perforin functional 
tests and a significant number of patients show polymorphisms or heterozygous mutations in PRF1 and 
UNC13D. Although it is an extremely severe and life threatening condition, usually it resolves when an 
adequate treatment is initiated, consisting in most cases of corticosteroids and cyclosporine. However, in 
approximately 15%18 of patients developing MAS, the disease can be difficult to control and the use of 
etoposide may be considered.   
While primary HLH is recognized as predominantly a childhood disease, HLH is a condition that can be 
found in adults, and increased awareness indicates this may happen more often than recognized in the 
past. In the majority of adult patients the disease develops during malignancies (mainly non-Hodgkin 
lymphomas), infections, auto-inflammatory or autoimmune diseases and iatrogenic immune deficiencies. 
There are currently no approved drugs for the treatment of HLH. However, experts in the field have 
established guidelines for the management HLH patients19-21.  
The management of primary HLH patients currently comprises of the following steps19:  
 Induction therapy of 8 weeks with a combination of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive 
drugs (e.g. etoposide, CsA, alemtuzumab, anti-thymocyte globulin ); 
 Maintenance therapy up to transplantation; 
 Transplantation for all patients with an identified genetic deficiency and eventually in very severe 
HLH cases with no disease-associated mutations. 
The main goal of induction therapy is to suppress the life-threatening inflammatory process that 
characterizes HLH, enabling transplantation in those patients who require it22. Transplantation is the only 
curative treatment for HLH associated with high penetrance genetic mutations20. 
Despite the adoption of such guidelines the overall mortality rate for primary HLH remains around 40 to 
50%20;23. 
The need to use, during the induction period, drugs associated with severe short and long term-safety 
issues further contributes to the already high mortality. This constitutes a strong argument for the 
development of a targeted treatment ensuring efficacy with less toxicity. 
1.3 STUDY RATIONALE 
During the last years, growing evidence of the pivotal role of IFNγ in the development of HLH has been 
generated7;14;15;24-26. 
The mutations of genes which characterize primary forms of HLH all affect proteins involved in the same 
process, ultimately impairing cytotoxic activity. Perforin mutations were the first identified in HLH 
patients.  
Perforin knocked out (KO) mice are considered a relevant model for the human disease. In fact, these 
mice, once infected with LCMV, develop all the diagnostic and many of the clinical and laboratory 
Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 23 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL characteristic features of the human disease, and they die if untreated. For these reasons, perforin KO 
mice have been used to study the pathophysiology of HLH. The HLH-like pathology that they develop is 
dependent on CD8+ T cells and IFNγ produced in response to antigen stimulation. 
It was demonstrated that when the high circulating levels of IFNγ are neutralized, with the administration 
of an anti-IFN  antibody, not only are the clinical and laboratory abnormalities reverted, but also survival 
rate is dramatically improved. On the contrary, the ablation of any other cytokine had no impact on 
survival14;15. 
Two models of secondary HLH have been investigated in the context of the NI-0501 development 
program. In one model, repeated administration of CpG ( causing TLR9  stimulation ) has been used to 
mimic a chronic severe hyperstimulation in healthy mice  (i.e. with normal genetics of the cytotoxic 
pathway) as a mode l of HLH secondary to infection . Although these mice do not necessar ily die, they 
develop typical clinica l and laboratory features of  HLH. When IFN γ is neutralized, with the 
administration of an anti -IFNγ antibody, clinical and laboratory features of the disease  are rever ted. 
Interestingly , in this model  it has been demons trated that administration of the anti -IFNγ antibody le ads 
to full neutralization of I FNγ effects also in relevant target tissues , such as liver an d spl een (manuscript in 
preparation ). 
To study the physiopathology of secondary HLH occurring in the context of rheumatic diseases, an 
animal model has been generated using IL-6 transgenic mice expressing high levels of IL-6, similarly to 
what occurs in patients with sJIA, the rheumatic disease most frequently associated with secondary forms 
of HLH. When triggered with Toll Like Receptor (TLR) ligands, these mice die with many of the features 
of the human disease27. In these mice, when IFNγ is neutralized with the administration of an anti-IFNγ 
antibody, survival is markedly improved and laboratory parameters reverted (Prencipe G et al, manuscript 
in preparation). 
Further strengthening the importance of IFNγ in HLH are the high concentrations of circulating IFNγ 
levels in primary HLH patients7;25.  In a series of 71 patients monitored from HLH diagnosis to treatment 
and follow-up, IFNγ levels were above the upper limit of normal (17.3 pg/mL) in all patients, and in 
particular 53.5% had levels above 1000 pg/mL. It was also reported that IFNγ levels rise early and 
quickly, and can fall from > 5000 pg/mL to normal in 48 hours upon effective treatment of HLH. 
More recently, in an observational study in patients with secondary forms of HLH, high levels of IFNγ 
were demonstrated both in patients with HLH secondary to infections and in patients with HLH occurring 
in the context of sJIA. The levels of CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11, three chemokines that are known to 
be induced by IFNγ, were also significantly elevated. Noteworthy, levels of IFN , and of the three IFN  
chemokines, were found to be significantly correlated with laboratory parameters of disease severity, 
such as ferritin, platelet count and transaminases (Bracaglia et al., manuscript submitted) 
As hypercytokinemia and organ infiltration by activated lymphocytes and histiocytes are responsible for 
all HLH symptoms and are dependent on CD8+ T cells hyperactivity and high IFNγ levels, the 
neutralization of IFNγ constitute s a rational therapeutic approach. In fact, no agents specifically targeting 
CD8+ T cells are available at the moment, and targeting individual cytokines downstream of IFNγ would 
not necessarily be feasible.  
Therefore, based on the data from animal models of primary and secondary HLH and from the 
observation made in patients with both primary and secondary HLH, confirming the critical role played 
by IFNγ in the pathogenesis of this disease, the neutralization of IFNγ offers a robust rationale  to 
develop a targeted therapy for HLH, which must be effective with no or limited toxicity.

3 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 OVERALL DESIGN 
This is an open-label, single arm, international, multicenter Phase 2/3 study.  
The study, initially designed as a pilot Phase 2 study, with the target of enrolling 10 evaluable patients 
with primary HLH, based on a positive benefit risk profile observed in the first 10 evaluable patients and 
in consideration of:  
i) the rare nature of the disease ;  
ii) the lack of valuable therapeutic options especially for patients having failed previous HLH 
therapies or being unable to continue due to toxicity ;  
iii) the significant number of requests for compassionate use of NI-0501 for HLH patients ;  
has been amended to become a Phase 2/3 continuing enrolment of both first and second line patients. 
Patients who receive NI-0501 after having failed conventional HLH therapy or having shown intolerance 
to it represent the pivotal cohort of the study, to demonstrate the efficacy of NI-0501 as second line 
treatment of primary HLH. 
Treatment-naïve patients will be enrolled for collection of efficacy and safety data in the first line setting . 
The study is divided in three parts: screening, treatment and follow-up. The study design is summarized 
in Figure 1 . 
If not already hospitalized, patients will be admitted to the unit the day before the first administration of 
the study drug (study day minus one, SD-1).   
Discharge from the hospital cannot occur before SD15. After SD15, in case the patient condition allows , 
the Investigator at the site can discharge a patient from the hospital provided the following condition has 
been met: 
- no active infections requiring IV antimicrobial therapy are present.

3.2 SCREENING PERIOD 
Screening will be carried out within 1 week prior to first administration of NI-0501 (SD0) to enable 
confirmation of patient eligibility and following the signature of the Informed Consent Form. 
In the event that a patient’s medical condition warrants rapid treatment initiation, and to avoid 
unnecessary repetition of recent interventions, results of tests which have been performed as part of the 
normal patient’s care at the site not more than 12 days prior to first NI-0501 infusion, can be considered 
for screening purposes (inclusion/exclusion criteria checks), with the agreement of both the Sponsor and 
the Investigator. 
Samples for infection screening need to be collected for analysis according to the protocol requirements; 
however availability of the results is not required prior to initiation of NI-0501 treatment provided that 
there are no clinical findings suggestive for the presence of any of the infections which represent 
exclusion criteria.  
3.3 TREATMENT PERIOD 
NI-0501 will be administered for 8 weeks as induction treatment of HLH. 
The treatment period will be divided in 2 separate periods: Treatment Period 1 and 2 (please refer to 
Figure 1) .  
If, according to the judgment of the treating physician, a patient’s condition and donor availability allow 
the performance of transplantation, NI-0501 treatment can be shortened, although not less than 4 weeks.  
Based on the current knowledge, no wash-out period is required between the last administration of NI-
0501 and the start of conditioning. 
In the event that an appropriate donor has not been identified by W eek 8 or in case of the need to delay 
the schedule of transplantation for reasons unrelated to the administration of NI-0501, NI-0501 treatment 
can be continued beyond this time upon the request of the Investigator, provided a favorable benefit/risk 
has been established for that patient.

Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL 3.4 FOLLOW-UP PERIOD 
All patients who have received at least one dose of NI-0501 will be monitored for 4 weeks after the last 
administration of NI-0501 within the context of the NI-0501-04 protocol, independently of the duration 
of treatment with NI-0501.  
In the event that the NI-0501 concentration is still measurable after the 4 week follow-up period (i.e. 
short-term follow-up), NI-0501 monitoring will continue until a measurable concentration of NI-0501 is 
no longer detectable. This monitoring should occur, whenever possible, in the context of the long-term 
follow-up study, NI-0501- 05.  
Patients for whom the Investigator has requested a prolongation of NI-0501 treatment beyond Week 8 
will directly enter the NI-0501-05 study without having to complete the 4 week short-term follow-up.  
3.5 STUDY END 
The end of the study is defined as the last visit of the last patient. 
The last visit of a patient should occur, at the latest, 4 weeks after the last administration of NI-0501 , 
except for patients continuing NI -0501 treatment beyond Week 8 (see paragraph below ). 
In case of an ongoing serious adverse event (SAE), the patient will continue to be monitored until 
resolution or until the outcome of the event is known and stable, beyond the defined study end as 
necessary. In the event that additional NI-0501 concentration monitoring is not performed in the context 
of the NI-0501-05 study, this monitoring will continue beyond the 4 week follow-up period, until a 
measurable concentration of NI-0501 is no longer detectable. This measurement should occur not less 
than every two weeks. 
In this study, no further treatment beyond Week 8 is planned. However, in the event that an appropriate 
donor has not been identified by Week 8 or in case of the need to delay the schedule of transplantation for 
reasons unrelated to the administration of NI-0501, NI-0501 treatment can be continued beyond this time 
upon the request of the Investigator, in the context of the NI-0501-05 study, providing a favorable 
benefit/risk has been established. For these patients,  end of study NI-0501 -04 is defined as the patient’s  
last visit (i.e. three days after the last infusion administered in the context of NI -0501 -04 study ). 
3.6 LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP STUDY (NI-0501-05) 
All patients having received at least one dose of NI-0501 in the pilot study will be asked to be part of the 
long-term follow-up study (NI-0501-05), to allow long-term safety surveillance, and, when relevant, 
investigation of the impact of NI-0501 treatment on survival and post-HSCT outcome measures. 
This study will also allow monitoring o f patients who have been considered for a treatment extension.

Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL 5.2 RATIONALE FOR DOSE SELECTION 
5.2.1 Initial dose (see Appendix A) 
Data from in vitro  experiments investigating the binding kinetics of NI-0501 to human IFNγ and the 
functional inhibition of human IFNγ by NI-0501 have been used for predicting the concentrations of NI-
0501 expected to inhibit (e.g. 99%) the effect of circulating IFNγ concentrations.  
These predictions were based on: 
 the calculated neutralizing concentrations of NI-0501  
 the PK parameters of NI-0501 in healthy volunteers  
 the PK information from recombinant IFNγ in humans.   
Simulations were performed regarding the dose that would inhibit the effect of circulating and newly 
formed IFNγ by up to 99% over a period of 3 days in HLH patients.  
Based on these simulations, the starting dose in HLH patients is 1 mg/kg. This dose is predicted to inhibit 
for 3 days at least 99% of IFNγ effect in patients with baseline IFNγ concentrations lower or equal to 
3400 pg/mL. This dose is mainly driven by the estimated production of IFNγ which is expected to impact 
the clearance of NI-0501 (due to target-mediated drug disposition) and varies considerably between 
patients as already indicated by the wide range of baseline IFNγ concentrations observed in these 
patients. 
5.2.2 Subsequent doses (see Appendices A and B) 
Due to the expected target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) effect and to the high inter-individual 
variability of IFNγ concentrations in HLH patients, doses subsequent to the initial one can be increased to 
3 mg/kg, if required, based on clinical and laboratory criteria (see Table 4).  
After a minimum of two infusions at 3 mg/kg, if upon re-assessment the same clinical and laboratory 
criteria are found to still apply, the dose of NI-0501 may be increased to 6 mg/kg for up to four infusions, 
with a regular monitoring of the clinical and laboratory HLH parameters.  
If clinical and laboratory response criteria are no longer applicable, the dose of NI-0501 will be decreased 
back to 3 mg/kg, 
On the other hand, if criteria still apply, based on careful benefit/risk assessment, the Investigator may 
propose either 
i) to continue treatment at 6 mg/kg for additional infusions  
        or  
ii) to increase NI-0501 dose above 6 mg/kg if PK and PD evidence indicates extremely high IFN  levels 
and, consequently, fast NI-0501 elimination. 
However, the Investigator ’s propos al of either continuing 6 mg/kg infusions or increasing the dose above 
6 mg/kg has to be discussed and approved by the DMC, after thorough assessment of all available data , 
including PK and PD. 
Appendix A “NI-0501 dose justification in HLH patients” provides a detailed descriptions of the 
rationale supporting the initial and subsequent NI-0501 doses in HLH patients. 
Appendix B “Decision making process on dose increase” includes a detailed description of the clinical 
criteria and the process to guide decision on dosing increase by the Investigator.

Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 31 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL 5.3 DOSING REGIMEN  
NI-0501 will be administered by IV infusion over a period of one hour, at a starting dose of 1 mg/kg.   
Infusions will be performed every 3 days for the first NI-0501 six infusions (until SD15). Dose increases 
are possible at any time during the study (see 5.2.2 above ). 
From SD15 during Treatment Period 2, the administration of NI-0501 will occur on a twice-a-week 
schedule. Elongation of the dosing interval to 1 week can occur after 4 weeks of treatment, if the patient 
has achieved Complete Response and maintained it for at least one week. 
5.4 IMP HANDLING 
5.4.1 Packaging and Labeling 
NI-0501 will be supplied to study sites in glass vials containing a either 2 and/or 10 ml solution at a 
concentration of 5mg/ml. Labeling and packaging will be prepared to meet local regulatory requirements. 
5.4.2 IMP Supply 
NI-0501 will be supplied to the study sites as open-label supplies. 
5.4.3 IMP Receipt and Storage 
The NI-0501 vials will be transported with temperature deviation alarms (TempTale 4 or equivalent 
device), in order to ensure consistent temperatures during transit. When the study drug is received at the 
site, the Investigator or Pharmacist will check for accurate delivery and absence of temperature deviation 
alarms. 
The study drug should be stored between 2 - 8°C (36 - 46°F). All vials must be stored in a secure locked 
location in a temperature-controlled refrigerator or cold room. Any deviations from the recommended 
storage conditions should be immediately reported to the Sponsor and responsible study monitor or 
contract research organization (CRO). Affected vials should not be used and should be quarantined until 
the Sponsor has authorized their use, return or destruction. 
Documentation of the storage conditions of the study drug must be maintained for the duration of the 
time the study drug is stored at the site, until such time as it is used, disposed of, or returned to 
NovImmune or designee. 
Regular inspections of the NI-0501 vials are required, as detailed in the IMP manual ’s directions for the 
Preparation and Administration of Individual Doses of Study Drug NI-0501. 
5.4.4 IMP Preparation, Administration, Accountability and Destruction 
5.4.4.1  Preparation  
The study drug must be prepared only by a Pharmacist or other appropriately qualified staff member, 
specifically authorized by the Investigator/Pharmacist and appropriately licensed to perform the task. 
The specific dose to be administered for an individual infusion is determined as detailed in Section 5.3 . 
As NI-0501 is dosed in mg/kg, the weight of the patient must be taken within 24 hours of the preparation 
of the study drug for administration.  
Full instructions for the preparation, including dilution steps, and method for administration of NI-0501 
are available in the IMP manual’s directions for the Preparation and Administration of Individual Doses 
of Study Drug NI-0501. 
Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 32 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL 5.4.4.2  Administration 
The patient should receive the designated volume of the infusion material through an infusion pump over 
1 hour (or more depending on the volume to infuse). A 0.2 μm filter has to be added to all infusion lines.  
It is recommended that an intravenous central line remains in place to ensure venous access during the 
treatment period. Since no data is available on the compatibility of NI-0501 with other intravenous 
substances or additives, other medications/substances should not be added to the infusion material or 
infused simultaneously through the same intravenous line. If the same intravenous line is used for 
subsequent infusions of other drugs, the line should be flushed with saline before and after infusion of 
NI-0501. 
The infusion of NI-0501 will be administered under the direct supervision of the Investigator (or 
delegate). It must be performed in the morning, preferably always at the same time, with a maximal 
tolerated difference in onset of infusion of not more than 3 hours compared to the initial infusion. Details 
of the infusion administered must be recorded in the patient’s Medical Notes (source documents) and 
CRF with: 
 The date of administration 
 The time (start and finish) of administration 
 The volume administered 
 Any incidence of adverse effects or general illness experienced by the patient. 
Any other event(s) judged relevant by the site personnel. 
5.4.4.3  Accountability 
When the study drug is received at the site, the Investigator or Pharmacist (or appropriate designee) 
should acknowledge its receipt by signing (or initialing) and dating the documentation. Documentation 
should be returned to NovImmune (or its designee) and a copy retained in the Investigator’s file. 
The dispensing of the study drug shall be carefully recorded on Drug Accountability Forms and an 
accurate accounting must be available for verification by the Monitor at each monitoring visit. 
The used (or unused) infusion material should be sent back to the Pharmacist at the end of the infusion, if 
possible, for later inventory. If this is not possible, accountability should be made at the bed-side before 
discarding the material. 
Drug accountability records shall include: 
 Confirmation of the study drug’s delivery to the study site 
 The inventory at the study site 
 The use of study drug by each patient  
 The return to the Sponsor or alternative disposition of unused products. 
The records should include dates, quantities, expiration dates, if applicable, and bat ch number and patient 
number.  
Unused study drug must not be discarded or used for any purpose other than the present study. Study 
drug that has been dispensed to a patient and returned unused must not be re-dispensed to a different 
patient. 
5.4.4.4  Destruction, Return and Disposal  
Periodically during the study and at the conclusion of participation of the study by the site, the clinical 
research associate (CRA) will monitor and collect the Drug Accountability Forms, before making 
arrangements for study drug return or authorization of destruction by the study site.

Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL 6 PATIENT BACKGROUND TREATMENT AND CARE 
6.1 BACKGROUND THERAPY WITH DEXAMETHASONE 
In treatment-naïve patients, NI-0501 will be administered on a background of 10 mg/m2 of 
dexamethasone. In patient receiving NI-0501 as second line HLH treatment, dexamethasone has to be 
administered at the dose of at least 5mg/m2, or at the same dose administered prior to screening if higher . 
Patients are required to have received dexamethasone from SD-1. 
Dexamethasone can be tapered depending on patient condition, according to the judgment of the treating 
physician. The tapering scheme can be selected by the treating physician, provided that the 
dexamethasone dose, at each step, is not more than halved and frequency of change is not more than 
weekly.  
In the event of disease worsening after tapering of dexamethasone, the dose of dexamethasone can be 
increased and maintained until a satisfactory response is achieved according to the treating physician.  
6.2 PROPHYLACTIC TREATME NT  
As recommended in HLH treatment guidelines, patients will receive prophylactic treatment for 
Pneumocystis jiroveci  and fungal infections. In addition, prophylaxis for HZ virus infection will be 
performed to mitigate the potential risk associated to NI-0501 administration (see Benefit/Risk 
Management, Section 9.5). In the unlikely event that a patient, previously vaccinated for TB, shows  a 
Purified Protein Derivative  (PPD)  test result ≥ 5mm and a negative IFNγ -release assay , the patients  will 
receive  TB prophylaxis.  
Patients will therefore receive prophylactic treatments starting from the day prior to initiation of NI-0501 
treatment (i.e. SD-1) until the end of the study: 
 For Pneumocystis jiroveci  prevention, according to Institution Guidelines/ Recommendations 
(e.g. 750 mg/m2/day sulfamethoxazole with 150 mg/m2/day trimethoprim given orally in 
equally divided doses twice a day, on 3 consecutive days per week ). 
 For fungal infection prevention, according to Institution Guidelines/Recommendations (e.g. 
Fluconazole 12 mg/kg daily with a maximum of 400 mg daily dose). 
 For HZ virus prevention, according to Institution Guidelines/Recommendations (e.g. 
Acyclovir 200 mg four times daily for children over two years, for children under two years 
100 mg four times daily). 
 For TB, if required (see above) according to Institution Guidelines/Recommendations (e.g. 
Isoniazid).  
These treatments will be given orally, whenever possible, otherwise intravenously. 
In the event that NI-0501 concentrations remain at therapeutic levels after the end of the study, it is 
strongly recommended that the prophylaxis against HZ virus be maintained, regardless of the 
participation of the patient in the NI-0501-05 study.  
Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 34 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL 6.3 CONCOMITANT THERAPY 
6.3.1 Cyclosporin A 
CsA can be continued, if already administered prior to screening. C sA can be withdrawn at any time, 
upon the judgment of the Investigator.  CsA is not to be introduced de novo  during the course of the 
study, once NI-0501 administration has started. As it is recommended in other HLH protocols, CsA 
concentrations should be monitored at least weekly to maintain trough levels of 150-200 ng/ml. 
6.3.2 Intra thecal Methotrexate and Glucocorticoids 
For patients receiving intrathecal methotrexate and glucocorticoids at the time of NI-0501 treatment 
initiation, this treatment should be continued as required. If the appearance of CNS symptoms occurs 
before the initiation of NI-0501 treatment, therapy with intrathecal methotrexate and glucocorticoids must 
be initiated prior to the first administration of NI-0501.  
6.3.3 Other possible concomitant therapies 
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) will not be administered at the dose expected to produce an 
immunomodulator effect (i.e. 2 g/kg) throughout the study. However, if deemed justified by the treating 
physician, in case of a documented immunoglobulin deficiency justifying replacement, IVIG c an be 
given at a dose of 0.5 g/kg, every 4 weeks or more frequently in order to maintain adequate IgG levels . 
Any infusion within the previous 4 weeks prior to screening, as well as any infusion during NI-0501 
treatment, should be documented in the CRF (dose, date of administration). 
Analgesic treatment, transfusion of blood products, electrolyte and glucose infusions, antibiotics, anti-
fungal and anti-viral treatment and general supportive care (e.g. gastro-protective agents, anti-
hypertensive etc.) are permitted within the study.  
Use of any additional prescription drugs or over-the-counter medication (including herbal and 
homeopathic preparations), with the exception of multi-vitamins, requires approval from the Investigator. 
Contraception guidance: See Inclusion Criteria, Section 4.1.1, point 6. 
6.3.4 Not allowed concomitant therapies 
As long as NI-0501 is being administered, concomitant use of etoposide, T-cell depleting agents, or any 
other biologic drug is generally not allowed, except for the followings: 
- G-CSF, in case of prolonged neutropenia  
- Rituximab, in case of documented EBV infection 
- additional HLH treatments, in case of unsustained or limited HLH improvement (as defined 
below) at the maximum NI-0501 dose level . Etoposide should be administered, unless a clear 
evidence of lack of response or intolerance to the drug is derived from previous medical history.  
In this circumstance, the Investigator may propose an alternative agent which requires to be 
approved by the Data Monitoring Committee. 
The definitions below apply: 
- Unsustained HLH Improvement:  
Patients who are unable to maintain at least 50% improvement from baseline in 3 HLH 
parameters (see Table 1 ). At least two consecutive measurements must document the loss of 
HLH improvement. 
 
 
Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 35 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL - Limited HLH Improvement:  
Less than 50% change from baseline in a minimum of 3 HLH clinical and laboratory 
criteria. 
Vaccination with a live or attenuated-live (including BCG) vaccine will be avoided during the whole 
study including the 4-week follow-up period. In the event that NI-0501 concentrations remain at 
therapeutic levels after the end of the study, the period with no vaccinations should be extended until 
measurable concentration of NI-0501 are no longer detectable.  
6.4 EMERGENCY TREATMENT 
Severe allergic reactions such as anaphylactic shock require prompt IV treatment with adrenaline and 
antihistamines. Oxygen shall be supplied through a face mask. Patients must have an appropriately sized 
IV line that allows rapid infusion of colloid volume substitution. In case of an anaphylactic reaction 
patients shall be transferred as soon as possible to the intensive care unit of the hospital.  
Following the first administration of NI-0501 and before leaving their reference center, each patient 
(and/or patient’s legal representative) will be given a card to carry at all times in case of any emergency. 
The card gives details of the name of the drug, name of the responsible physician, and the address and 
telephone number of the study site; this card will be collected by the Investigator from the patient after 
the end of the study. 
6.5 RESCUE THERAPY 
Patients withdrawn from the study due to a safety issue or for lack of efficacy (i.e. worsening of HLH or 
no response to NI-0501; see Section 10.1.3 ) will be managed according to the standard of care at the site.  
7 ENDPOINTS 
7.1 SAFETY ENDPOINTS 
Safety and tolerability of multiple IV infusions of NI-0501 will be assessed as follows: 
 Incidence, severity, causality and outcomes of AEs (serious and non-serious), with particular 
attention being paid to infections 
 Evolution of laboratory parameters such as complete blood cell count (CBC), with focus on red cells 
(hemoglobin), neutrophils and platelets, liver tests, renal function tests and coagulation 
 Number of patients withdrawn for safety reasons 
 Level (if any) of circulating antibodies against NI-0501 to determine immunogenicity; i.e. the 
development of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). 
7.2 EFFICACY ENDPOINTS 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
 Overall Response Rate, i.e. achievement of either Complete or Partial Response or HLH 
Improvement, at End of Treatment (EoT). 
Criteria for the definition of Overall Response Rate are reported in Table 1.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints :

7.3 PHAR MACOKINETIC ENDPOINTS 
All PK data will be summarized using appropriate graphical and tabular presentations. Descriptive non-
compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis (NCA) will be applied: C max (concentration corresponding to 
Tmax), T max (time of maximum observed concentration), C EOI (concentration at the end of infusion), C trough 
(concentration just before administration), AUC  (area under curve of a dosing interval), AUC last (area 
under curve from the time of dosing to the last measurable concentration), λz (first order rate constant 
associated with the terminal (log-linear) portion of the curve, estimated via linear regression of time 
versus log concentration), t ½ (plasma half-life), CL (systemic drug clearance), Vss (volume of distribution 
at steady state). Individual and mean PK parameters will be tabulated. Exploratory compartmental 
pharmacokinetic analysis and population pharmacokinetic analysis will be undertaken to investigate 
linear and non-linear (TMDD) kinetics. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis will also be 
undertaken. 
7.4 PHARMACODYNAMIC ENDPOINTS 
Determination of PD parameters will include, but will not be limited to, the following: 
 Levels of circulating free IFN  at predose , and of total IFNγ (free + bound) at any subsequent 
time-point 
 Markers of IFNγ neutralization, namely CXCL-9, CXCL-10, CXCL-11  
 Others biomarkers (e.g. sCD25, IL-10)  
8 OUTLINE OF STUDY PRO CEDUR ES 
Patients will be recruited from specialized study sites, with an intensive care unit. 
For a detailed description of the schedule of visits and assessments, please refer to the Schedule of 
Assessment Table 2 (Screening and Treatment Period 1) and Table 3 (Treatment Period 2 and Follow-up 
Period). 
The informed consent form must be signed by the patient or his/her legally authorized representative 
prior to any study-related procedures, with the assent of patients who are deemed suitable to provide it.  
Some procedures are not to be done systematically but only if clinically relevant.  
For example: 
 ECG is only mandatory at screening, after first infusion, after last infusion and at the end of the 
study, but can also be done at any other time point, if relevant,  
 Brain MRI should be done in case of neurological symptoms occurrence, 
 Lumbar puncture for CSF analysis is done (providing that coagulation function allows) only at 
screening but should be repeat ed during the study course if the initial analysis at screening was 
abnormal or in case of occurrence of neurological symptoms,  
 Search for pathogens during the study should be done if there is any suspicion of infection,  
Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 37 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL  Chest X-ray during the study should be done more frequently than indicated in case of clinical 
suspicion of a pulmonary infection. 
Analysis done on blood samples will favor as much as possible the use of micro-sampling techniques.  
In case of a need for prioritization of blood analysis, laboratory safety parameters (which would have 
been done as normal disease monitoring) will be prioritized. For details on blood sampling, please refer 
to Appendix C. 
For safety laboratory and search for pathogens, the planned schedule of assessment is in accordance with 
recommendations for the monitoring of disease evolution and potential for infection in these severely sick 
patients (HLH-2004 protocol of the Histiocyte Societyiii). This has been agreed by the study ’s Scientific 
Steering Committee (SSC) .  
The additional amounts of blood which will be drawn for study mandatory specific assessments represent 
only 24.5 mL for PK assessments and 1.5 mL for immunogenicity monitoring. A maximum of 29 ml of 
blood  are required for PD assessments and will be only taken if the amount of blood required is 
acceptable in the context of the EMA guidelineiv and US pediatric recommendationsv. 
The following situations will not be considered as protocol deviations: 
- Missing data if not occurring at 2 consecutive time-points,  
- Missing urinalysis, except for the test to be performed at Screening (or SD0), EoT and EoS,  
- Vital signs measured within no more than 1 minute before or after the planned time-point when 
measured every 5, 10 or 15 minutes, within no more than 10 minutes before or after the planned time-
point when measured every hour or 2 hours, and within no more than 15 minutes before or after the 
planned time-point when measured every 4 or 8 hours, 
- Infusion start delayed by no more than 3 hours,  
- Physical examination prior to each infusion performed in the late afternoon of the previous day 
instead of the morning of the infusion (the data will be captured on the infusion day of the eCRF), 
- Assessments performed within no more than 48h before or after the planned time-point during the 
Follow-up Period. 
8.1 SCREENING 
Patients will be screened for eligibility prior to enrolment in to the study. The Investigator must keep a log 
of the patients screened for the study and reasons for non-eligibility. 
Screening evaluations should be completed within 1 week prior to the first administration of study drug 
(SD0) as detailed below.  In the event that a patient’s medical condition warrants rapid treatment  
initiation , and to avoid unnecessary repetition of recent interventions, results of tests which have been

8.9 STUDY COMPLETION VISIT (4 TH WEEK AFTER THE LAST NI-0501 INFUSION) OR 
WITHDR AWAL VISIT 
Patients will attend a final study completion visit, four weeks after the last NI-0501 administration. In 
case a patient enters the NI-0501-05 study while still receiving NI-0501, the study completion visit is 
replaced by the EoT visit under the NI-0501-04 study. 
The same assessment procedures should also be followed by the Investigator for any patient who is 
withdrawn prematurely from the study as soon as possible after the decision to withdraw is made. For 
patients who withdraw from the study as a result of their own decision or the decision of their 
parent/guardian, the Investigator should contact the patient (or parent/guardian) and ask them to attend a 
withdrawal visit as soon as possible. Withdrawal ( WD) visits should be scheduled within 30 days of 
termination whenever possible. 
Patients who are withdrawn due to a SAE should be follow ed-up until the resolution of the event or until 
the outcome of the event is known and stable. 
The following assessments will be performed at the Study Completion Visit or WD visit: 
Clinical assessments:  
  Vital signs (blood pressure, oxygen saturation heart and 
respir atory rate ) and temperature

8.10 ASSESSMENTS IN CASE OF UNPLANNED (UNSCH EDULED)  VISITS 
Unplanned visits may occur should the patient need to be assess ed or treat ed for any clinical condition 
that arises during the study. This may include the evaluation and follow-up of AEs, SAEs or laboratory 
tests. The following assessments (as detailed in the Schedule of Assessments ) should always be 
performed at minimum , but additional assessments may be added according to the clinical judgment of 
the Investigator. 
Clinical assessments:  
  Vital signs (blood pressure, heart and respiratory rat e and oxygen 
saturation) and temperature  
 Physical examination, includin g spleen and liver size ( in cm from

Additional PK/PD samples may be required to better characterize the PK/PD profile and/or for safety 
reasons.  
The number of additional samples taken will depend on the weight and health status of the patient. 
Sampling schedule will be proposed by the Sponsor and discussed with the site.  
9 SAFETY MONITORING 
9.1 STUDY SCIENTIFIC OVERSIGHT 
A Scientific S teering Committee (SSC) composed of international experts in primary and secondary HLH 
has been involved in the preparation of study design and protocol writing. 
This SSC has also been consulted for the composition of the DMC, the selection of its members and the 
elaboration of the DMC Charter (see Section 9.5.1 ).  
The SSC will continue to play an advisory role throughout the course of the study and will perform 
evaluations of the results for the Sponsor as well as for the DMC. Please refer to Appendix D for full 
details of membership of the SSC. 
The DMC, composed of relevant experts (2 pediatric onco-hematologists, 2 pediatric immunodeficiency/ 
infectious disease specialists, a bio-statistician and a specialist in ethics), will oversee the study conduct 
and evaluate safety and relevant efficacy parameters. See Section 9.5.1  for further details of the DMC.  
9.2 DESCRIPTION OF SAFETY PARAMETERS 
Evaluation of NI-0501 tolerability and safety will be based on the following parameters: 
Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 49 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL  Adverse events (AEs), with special attention being paid to events potentially related to the 
infusion of NI-0501 (events occurring during the infusions and within 24 hours post infusion) 
and to the occurrence of infections 
 Laboratory parameters :  
- Complete blood count (CBC), 
- Coagulation tests (activated partial thromboplastin, prothrombin time), d-Dimer and 
fibrinogen 
- Biochemistry: glucose and electrolytes, ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 
γGT, LDH, triglycerides, bilirubin, albumin, creatinine and urea. 
- Urinalysis 
 Vital signs: temperature, heart and respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation 
 Physical examination with particular attention paid to: 
- weight evolution, occurrence of edema or ascites 
- occurrence of skin rashes, jaundice, purpura, bleeding 
- signs of infections (e.g. tonsillitis, lymphadenopathies, cough and/or dyspnea),  
- neurological examination  
- liver and spleen size 
 Immunogenicity: development of anti- NI-0501antibodies  
9.3 RECORDING AND REPORTING SAFETY PARAMETERS 
The Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies issued in December 2012 will be 
followed.  
9.3.1 Adverse events 
Adverse events (AEs) are defined as any undesirable experience occurring to a subject during the study, 
whether or not considered related to the investigational product. All AEs reported spontaneously by the 
patients or his/her relatives or observed by the Investigator or his staff during the clinical study from the 
signature of the ICF up to and including the end-of-study visit will be reported on the AE data collection 
form.  
Medical conditions present at screening should be recorded in the medical history section of the e CRF . 
An AE which occurs between start of screening visit and start of first IMP administration will be 
considered as a pre-treatment AE.  
Any AE that occurs after the start of the first IMP administration will be considered as a Treatment 
Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE). 
However, if a pre-existing medical condition recorded in the medical history worsens (clinically 
significant change in intensity or frequency), it must be recorded as an AE in the eCRF and, depending 
on the time of its occurrence, will be considered as a pre-treatment AE or a TEAE. If a medical condition 
recorded as a pre-treatment AE worsens post IMP administration, it will be recorded in the eCRF as a 
separate TEAE.  
For all AEs, the following will be assessed and recorded: intensity, relationship to IMP, action taken 
regarding IMP, any treatment received and outcome to date.  
Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 50 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL Intensity of adverse events will be graded on a three-points scale (mild, moderate, severe) using the 
modified WHO (World Health Organization) toxicity scale (Grade 3 and 4 are considered to be the 
severe grade). If AE severity is not mentioned in the scale, assessment will be made using the following 
definitions: 
 Mild: Discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal activity 
 Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity 
 Severe: Inability to work or perform normal daily activity. 
For a given AE, the assessment of its intensity should reflect the highest grade (on the 3 points scale 
mentioned above) reported during its course (except when the intensity of a pre-treatment AE increases 
after treatment initiation, as indicated above).  
AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each episode. 
The relationship of adverse events to the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) will be assessed by the 
Investigator using a “Yes/No” classification. A “Yes” relationship infers that there is a reasonable 
suspected causal relationship to the trial medication and the adverse event can also be called suspected 
adverse reaction. The expression “reasonable causal relationship” is meant to convey that there are facts, 
evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. In this study NI-0501 is the only IMP.  
9.3.2 Serious Adverse Events 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it. 
 results in death (note: death is an outcome, not an event); 
 is life-threatening; (note: the term "life-threatening" refers to an event in which the patient 
was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe); 
 requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongs an existing hospitalization; 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may 
be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient 
or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
For the purposes of this study, the following will not be considered as SAEs: 
 Elective hospitalizations or surgical procedures that are a result of a patient’s pre-existing 
condition(s) which have not worsened since receiving IMP. Such events should still be 
recorded as adverse events in the eCRF; 
 Hospitalization as requested per protocol for NI-0501infusion and study visits. 
Any serious adverse event (SAE) that occurs during the course of the study, irrespective of the treatment 
received by the subject and regardless of causality to the study drug, must be communicated by the 
Investigator to NovImmune, by fax or elec tronic transmission, within 24 hours of awareness. 
For the initial SAE report, the Investigator should report all available case details concerning the patient 
and the event, using the NovImmune SAE reporting standard form (see Appendix E).  
 
 
Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 51 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL NovImmune contact information for SAE reporting: 
 
Relevant follow-up information on SAEs should be forwarded to NovImmune as soon as it becomes 
available. In addition, the Investigator must be available to answer without delay any request for follow-
up information or questions NovImmune may have regarding the SAE. 
All SAEs will be recorded on the appropriate page of the e CRF . They will be reviewed, evaluated and 
followed through to resolution by a study physician. 
If either the Sponsor or Investigator believes that the event is serious, the event must be considered 
serious and evaluated by the Sponsor for expedited reporting (21 CFR 312.32(a) and 312.32(c)(1)).  
9.3.3 SUSAR reporting 
Unexpected adverse reactions are all untoward and unintended responses to an investigational product 
related to any dose administered. 
These reactions are SUSARs if the following two conditions are met: 
1) the event must be serious (see Section 9.3.2 ); 
2) there must be a certain degree of probability that the event is a harmful and an undesirable reaction to 
the medicinal product under investigation, regardless of the administered dose. 
Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), the Sponsor (directly or through a delegated third party) is required to notify 
FDA and all participating Investigators in an IND safety report (i.e. 7- or 15-day expedited report) of 
potentially serious risks from clinical trials or any other source as soon as possible, but no later than 15 
calendar days after the Sponsor receives the safety information and determines that the information 
qualifies for reporting. 
US Investigators are required to promptly report to the IRB  all unanticipated problems involving risk to 
human subjects or others, including adverse events that should be considered unanticipated problems (21 
CFR 312.66), such as IND safety reports. 
NovImmune will also report all SUSARs to the EMA's EudraVigilance database within 15 days, as well 
as to the relevant National Competent Authorities when required. Fatal and life-threatening suspected 
SUSARs will be reported within 7 calendar days, with another 8 days for completion of the report.  
9.3.4 Managing Abnormal Laboratory Test Values  
All safety laboratory tests (hematology and blood biochemistry), for each visit time-point, should be 
captured in the database from the local laboratory and should not be reported as AEs unless specific 
treatment is given for the abnormality (e.g. a blood transfusion is given for a low hemoglobin) or a 
laboratory abnormality leads to further investigation and the diagnosis of a new clinical event (e.g. a high 
white cell count is found to be due to incident al leukemia). In this event the clinical diagnosis should be 
reported on the AE form, not the laboratory abnormality leading to the diagnosis. Clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory test value can be qualified as important medical events (see Section 9.3.2) and 
should then follow the process described in this section.

Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL 9.4 FOLLOW-UP OF SAFETY PARAMET ERS  
9.4.1 Treatment and Follow-up of Adverse Events 
Adverse events, especially those for which the relationship to the study drug has been assessed as ‘Yes’ , 
should be followed-up until the event has returned to baseline status or has stabilized. If a clear 
explanation is established, it should be recorded on the CRF. 
All SAEs must be followed-up until the event has either resolved or reached a stable clinical outcome. 
9.4.2 Follow-up of Abnormal Laboratory Test Values 
In the event of unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test values, the tests should be 
repeated immediately and followed-up until the values have returned to within normal range and/or an 
adequate explanation of the abnormality has been found. If a clear explanation is established, it should be 
recorded on the eCRF. 
9.4.3 Pregnancy 
In the event that a pregnancy occurs during the trial course, it must be reported to NovImmune within 24 
hours of awareness. This includes pregnancies occurring in partners of male enrolled patients. All 
information pertaining to the pregnancy should be reported using the NovImmune Pregnancy form (see 
Appendix F). Pregnancies should be followed until conclusion to obtain outcome information. 
Occurrence of a pregnancy in a study participant will preclude any further IMP administration and the 
patient will be withdrawn.  
On withdrawal the assessments presented in the Schedule of Assessments are to be performed (see 
Section 8.9). 
9.5 BENEFIT/RISK MANAGEM ENT  
9.5.1 Safety Surveillance Management 
The main responsibility of the DMC is to review all safety and relevant efficacy data as they are 
generated to ensure that no patient is exposed to unnecessary risk and to continuously assess the 
benefit/risk profile of NI-0501.  
The DMC can recommend treatment discontinuation for individual patients as well as to halt the entire 
study temporarily or permanently. Predefined stopping rules will guide the DMC review process. For 
more details, see stopping rules in Section 10. 
9.5.2 General Benefit/Risk Considerations  
9.5.2.1  Potential benefits 
On the basis of the data available to date28, NI-0501 adm inistration has shown the potential to improve or 
resolve relevant clinical and laboratory abnormalities of HLH, including CNS signs and symptoms when 
present , allowing most of the patients to  proceed to HSCT (9 out of 15 patients who have  completed the 
study with 3 additional patient ready for HSCT pending donor availability).  Three patients underwent 
HSCT only after 4 weeks of NI -0501 treatment . The response to NI -0501 seems  independent of:  
- the presence and typ e of causative mutations  
- the presence and type of an infectious trigger  
- the line of treatment, although data obtained in patients in first line are still limited .  
For m ore details refer to the latest Investigator’s Brochure (pres ently version 5.0, dated 20 January 2016) .  
9.5.2.2  Risks analysis 
 Risks related to NI-0501 
Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 53 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL NI-0501 is a monoclonal antibody of IgG1. 
Upon the administration of mAbs, which are proteins, acute infusion reactions can occur. These may 
happen during the infusion or in the subsequent hours (usually within the first 24 hours)29. 
These reactions are either IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylactic reactions), or 
anaphylactoid reactions not mediated by IgE. True anaphylactic reactions usually do not occur upon 
initial infusion and require a certain sensitization. In contrast, the pathophysiology of anaphylactoid 
reactions appears to be secondary to the release of cytokines consequent to a mAb binding to circulating 
antigen-expressing cells. However, the clinical manifestations of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid 
reactions overlap, and both may lead to life-threatening conditions, involving cardiovascular, respiratory, 
central nervous, gastro-intestinal, and cutaneous systems. The management of anaphylactic and 
anaphylactoid reactions involves immediate administration of oxygen, epinephrine, vasopressors, 
bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and/or antihistamines.  
After 14 single infusions to HVs up to and including the dose of 3 mg/kg and more than 380 infusions 
administered to HLH patients (either in the context of the NI-0501-04 and NI-0501-05 studies or in 
patients who received NI-0501 in compassionate use) up to and including the dose of 10 mg/kg, no 
significant infusion related reaction has been observed. Only transient erythematous rashes localized to 
the extremities (feet and/or hands) resolving spontaneously have been observed in a few patients during 
the first infusions of NI-0501 in the NI-0501-04 study. On a few occasions, administration of NI-0501 
has been performed through a peripheral venous access and all infusions were uneventful.   
When administered to humans, most mAb therapeutics elicit some level of antibody response (anti-drug 
antibodies or ADAs) against the therapeutic product, as early as after the first exposure. No sign of 
immunogenicity has been reported in the NI-0501 study in HVs. The presence of ADA will be assessed 
throughout this study as per regulatory recommendations. The full analysis is planned to be performed at 
the end of the NI-0501-04 study.  Data accumulated so far (in particular PK profiles and a negative ADA 
search performed in the only patient who developed hemolytic anemia during conditioning) have not led 
to suspect the presence of ADA.  
 Risks related to the target 
The impact on the immune defense  caused by the neutralization of IFNγ is known from patien ts with 
inborn errors of the IL -12/23 -IFN-γ circuit, particularly patients with complete or partial IFNγ receptor 
(R) deficiency, and subjects developing neutralizing auto anti-IFNγ antibodies . 
Patients with IFNγ R deficiency are prone to develop mycobacterial infections and, although to a lesser 
extent, Salmonella  infections30;31. 
The mean age of the first environmental mycobacterial infection is 3.1 and 13.4 years in patients with 
complete and partial deficiency, respectively32. No systematic prophylaxis is recommended in these 
patients. 
If an infection occurs, appropriate antibiotherapy based on sensitivity of isolated species is prescribed. 
Individuals with anti-IFNγ auto-antibodies are also susceptible to develop mycobacterial infections (for 
the vast majority atypical mycobacterial infections), but also opportunistic infections (e.g. by 
Histoplasma Capsulatum, Salmonella , Herpes Zoster  virus infections)6.Toxicological studies carried out 
with NI -0501 have shown an increased susceptibility  of the monkeys having received NI -0501  to enteral 
pathogen  infections when the pathogen is present  into the intestinal tract  prior to NI -0501 administration . 
Presence of  infections due to  Shigella , Salmonella and Campylobacter  is part of the exclusion criteria.  
NI-0501 has been administered to 14 HVs in a single ascending dose study, which confirmed the absence 
of off-target toxicity. A reactivation of HZ virus, at a dose of 3 mg/kg , observed in one healthy volunteer , 
may have be en due to the pharmacodynamics effect of the drug (see Clinical Information, Section 1.1.3 ). 
Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 54 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL It is difficult to draw a firm conclusion from one case, but it seems prudent, in the context of this study, to 
include HZ virus prophylaxis for all patients.  
Preliminary data on infections reported in 17 patients enrolled in the NI-0501-04 stud y allow the 
following conclusions to be drawn:  
- Active infections, in particular EBV or CMV infections, which are often the trigger of the HLH initial 
episode or reactivation/worsening, were present  at the first administration of NI-0501. During NI-0501 
administration these infections resolved with appropriate antimicrobial treatment and while achieving 
control of HLH. 
- Patients develop ed infections during the course of NI-0501 treatment. However in the presence of a 
satisfactory control of HLH, and upon appropriate anti-microbial treatment, infections resolved.   
- None of the bacterial, viral or fungal infections reported were due to pathogens known to be favored by 
IFNγ neutralization. 
- The severity and duration of neutropenia, a hallmark of HLH as well as a potential consequence of 
previous HLH treatments, seemed to contribute significantly to the development of infections.  
A long and profound generalized immune suppression caused by HLH treatments administered prior to 
the initiation of NI-0501 constitutes a higher risk for infection development.  
- The patients who have received NI-0501 treatment as first line HLH therapy, no infection was reported 
during the NI-0501-04 study. 
- Systematic search for tuberculosis was negative and no atypical mycobacteria were detected in any of 
the patients. Stool/blood cultures were negative for Salmonella , Shigella  or Campylobacter  in all patients. 
For m ore details refer to the lat est Investigator’s Brochure (presently version 5.0, dated 20 January 2016) .  
 Risk related to the study population 
Most of the patients are expected to be children of a young age affected by a life-threatening disease and 
are expected to have already received HLH treatments; therefore they carry variable degree of toxicities 
caused by those treatments. The data collected to date show that administration of NI-0501 does not 
aggravate these toxicities while showing, in general, a favorable impact on disease activity.  
All information collected with regards to disease stage and previous treatments are taken into account for 
the analysis of adverse events.  
Toxicities of concomitant treatments, authorized or recommended during the administration of NI-0501, 
may also potentially expose the patients to adverse events; however their benefits are expected to 
outweigh their risks. No safety concern related to the concomitant administration of NI-0501 with other 
treatments (e.g., antimicrobial agents, anti-hypertensive drugs) has been reported so far. Corticosteroids 
have already been administered with IFNγ therapy in Crohn’s Disease without any particular safety 
concerns4. Of interest, tapering of glucocorticoids had no impact on safety and tolerability of NI-0501 
infusions and has shown benefit for patients with steroids-related hypertension and generalized 
immunosuppression. 
Treatment-naïve patients are not exposed to risks associated with the drugs used conventionally to treat 
HLH (e.g., generalized immune suppression).  
As the risk that NI-0501 will not be able to control the disease may exist, the possibility to receive 
additional HLH therapy to NI-0501 or to receive rescue therapy upon discontinuation of NI-0501 is 
foreseen. Risks associated with the administration of other therapies after having received NI-0501 seems 
to be very low, since no particular safety concerns related to the administration of NI-0501 were observed 
in pati ents receiving NI-0501 as second line therapy. Furthermore, t wo primary HLH patients have 
Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 55 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL received other HLH therapies (e.g., etoposide and alemtuzumab) after NI-0501 discontinuation with no 
particular safety concern. For one of them, NI-0501 was re-initiated in Compassionate Use as the patient 
continued to worsen after the reintroduction of etoposide and the independent DMC judged the benefit 
risk profile of NI-0501 positive for this particular patient. Both these patients underwent HSCT.  
9.5.2.3  Risk minimization measures 
In view of the expected benefits, the above listed risks are considered to be manageable in this patient 
population, if adequate minimization measures are put in place. An overview of specific measures to 
minimize the subject’s risk is provided below: 
 Study designed with HLH experts forming the SSC 
 Patients are hospitalized in specialized centers for the treatment of HLH, and therefore with 
all necessary emergency assistance equipment 
 Inclusion/exclusion criteria: patients with malformations or severely altered functions (either 
due to the disease stage or to a concomitant disease), as well as patients with evidence of 
patent or latent TB infections  or active mycobacteria , Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter  
or Leishmania  infections, will not be included in the study (for details see Section 4.1)  
 Infusion Related Reaction (IRR) monitoring: patients will be very closely monitored during 
the study drug infusions and for up to 24 hours following them to immediately identify if the 
subject is experiencing any IRRs. Each of the specialized centers will have physicians 
adequately trained in IRR management (please see NI-0501-04 Study Specific Risk 
Management Plan for further details). 
 Recommendations on prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci , fungal infections and HZ virus 
for all patients and Tuberculosis for a defined subpopulation (see section 6.2)  in the protocol 
to avoid occurrence of these infections  
 Close monitoring of potential infections through careful physical examination, laboratory 
parameters, active search for EBV, CMV, Adenovirus es, detection of tuberculosis  
 Study safety surveillance by a Data Monitoring Committee 
The Development Risk Management Plan address es risks, identify signals for early detection of safety 
concerns and propose mitigating actions. It will be part of the study documentation shared with 
Investigators and any relevant third party involved in the study. 
Stopping rules have been also developed to ensure individual patient safety and determine whether the 
study should be put on hold or terminated prematurely.  
10 STOPPING RULES 
10.1 AT PATIENT LEVEL 
10.1.1  Decision to slow down or stop NI-0501 infusion due to systemic reaction 
During the infusion of NI-0501, any significant change compared to pre-infusion values in vital signs, 
such as those listed below, should trigger appropriate immediate care:  
 Sudden and sustained increase or paradoxical decrease of heart rate (duration of more than 1 
minute) compared to pre-infusion value 
 Respiratory rate abnormality (significant change compared to measure prior to infusion)  
 Blood pressure drop or peak compared to the value prior to infusion for at least 2 consecutive 
measurements  
Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 56 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL  Significant skin modifications (change in color or abundant sweating) 
 Sustained (an episode of more than 3 minutes duration or more than 3 episodes of shorter 
duration i.e. 1 minute) oxygen desaturation (below 90%). 
The decision to slow down the infusion will be taken by the physician in the event of any of the above 
mentioned occurrences. 
The decision to stop the infusion will be based on the evolution of patient status after appropriate 
symptomatic measures, e.g. oxygenation, and upon physician’s own medical judgment.  
All changes in infusion rate will be recorded in the eCRF: each time with a rate modification as well as 
end of the premature or delayed termination of the infusion.  
10.1.2  Local reaction to NI-0501 infusion  
Unless related to a hypersensitivity reaction, a local infusion issue such as catheter displacement, 
obstruction or product extravasation, will trigger the infusion of the remaining quantity through a new 
venous access as soon as possible. All information related to the incident will be recorded accurately. 
This includes reasons, volume of IMP potentially lost (in order to calculate the quantity of drug infused) , 
time at which the infusion stopped, time at which the infusion was resumed and time of end of the 
infusion.  
To avoid this type of incident, it is preferable for a central venous access to be used : this will improve 
patient’s comfort and ensure a reliable drug administration in particular in infants and toddlers or in case 
of foreseen difficulties with peripheral venous access.  
10.1.3  Decision to Discontinue Treatment 
An Investigator can decide at any time during the study to discontinue the treatment for an individual 
patient based on his/her own medical judgment, taking into account the individual benefit risk ratio for 
his/her patient. In addition, the patient (or their legal representative) can decide at any time to withdraw 
from the study.  
In any case the decision to withdraw or be withdrawn will have no impact on the patient’s care and 
further treatments administered to him/her after withdrawal. The management of these patients is 
described in Section 10.3. 
10.1.3.1  Treatment Discontinuation for a Safety Reason 
Some situations may trigger an immediate decision to permanently discontinue treatment. A patient 
should be discontinued from study treatment if a SAE occurring after NI-0501 administration is: 
1. Considered by the Investigator to be related to NI-0501 (with guidance from the DMC if needed ) 
AND  
2. is a life-threatening event. 
All other AEs will be judged by the DMC on a case- by-case basis taking into account the disease 
evolution (such as signs of improvement in HLH) and the possibility of managing the AE and ensuring 
that no patient is exposed to unnecessary risks. 
10.1.3.2  Treatment Discontinuation for Lack of Efficacy 
A patient should be withdrawn from the NI-0501-04 study if, after having added an additional therapy 
concomitantly to NI-0501, no response or lack of improvement is observed.  
However, at the request of the investigator, the DMC can agree to maintain the patient in the study if , 
after having determined a favorable benefit/risk for NI-0501 in this patient through a thorough review of 
Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 57 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL patient’s data, it is considered that loss of neutralization of IFN γ could expose patient to the risk of HLH 
worsening. The DMC may propose continuing the administration of NI-0501 under certain conditions 
which have to be accepted and implemented by the Investigator at the site. 
10.2 AT STUDY LEVEL 
10.2.1  Recruitment Suspension 
Recruitment may be temporary suspended in the following situations: 
 Any occurrence of death or life-threatening SAE related to the drug  
 At the DMC’s own request as an outcome of their regular study review 
Patients already enrolled in the study should continue receiving NI-0501 as per protocol unless decided 
otherwise by the Investigator. 
The suspension will allow the DMC to analyze the data already generated and to formulate 
recommendations. 
After re-evaluation of benefit/risk profile, the DMC may recommend any of the following:  
 To resume recruitment without any change 
 To implement minimization measures that may require protocol amendment 
 To implement conditions for study termination: e.g. next occurrence of a particular serious drug 
reaction  
10.2.2  Study Termination 
Occurrence of two deaths suggesting a reasonably possible relationship with continuous exposure to NI-
0501 and occurring in similar conditions will trigger the decision to terminate the study. 
This process will involve both the DMC and the Investigator s. The management of patients already 
enrolled in the study will also be part of the DMC recommendations. 
 
10.3 MANAGEMENT OF TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION 
All patients who are withdrawn from the study will be treated according to the standard care at the site. 
They should be assessed as indicated in Section 8.9. 
11 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYTICAL PLAN 
Full details of all statistical issues and planned statistical analyses will be specified in a separate 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to the locking of the study database. This 
section contains an overview of the planned methods of analysis. 
11.1 SAMPLE SIZE  
11.1.1  Sample Size 
Sample size estimation has been done for the pivotal cohort of the study, i.e. patients receiving NI-0501 
in second line. 
A minimum of 28 patients treated with NI-0501 in second line will be enrolled in the study. Sample size 
calculation is based on the primary efficacy endpoint of “Overall Response Rate”. Assuming an Overall 
Response Rate of 70%, the study will have 90% power to show a significant improvement above 40% 
using an exact binomial test33 at a one-sided significance level of 2.5%. Due to the rarity of primary 
Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 58 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL HLH, the recruitment is competitive across all EU and US sites in order to gather data in a reasonable 
timeframe.  
11.2 ANALYSIS SETS   
All analysis sets will be defined prior to final database closure. In addition to the analysis sets listed 
below, further exploratory analyses may be performed using other subgroups of patients. 
11.2.1  Safety Analysis Set 
The safety analysis set will include all patients who receive any part of an infusion of study drug. 
11.2.2  Intent- to-Treat Analysis Set 
The intent- to-treat (ITT) analysis set will include all patients who receive any part of an infusion of study 
drug. 
11.2.3  Per-Protocol Analysis Set 
The per-protocol analysis set will consist of all ITT patients who complete the study without violations of 
the study protocol. Details of the analysis will be defined in the SAP prior to locking of the fina l 
database. 
11.3 STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL METHODS 
For measurements of continuous endpoints, summary statistics will include n, mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimum and maximum values. For binary data (proportions of patients showing a defined 
response for example) numbers and percentages will be tabulated. For time to event data, Kaplan-Meier 
plots will be provided together with the median should this be available. Finally 95% confidence intervals 
will be calculated for suitable summary statistics associated with endpoints of interest. 
All efficacy analyses will be undertaken on both the ITT and PP analysis sets although the primary 
efficacy analyses will focus on the subgroup of second line patients. All safety analyses will be conducted 
on the safety set. 
11.3.1  Efficacy Data 
The analysis of the primary endpoint, Overall Response Rate will utilize an exact binomial test to 
evaluate the null hypothesis that the response rate is at most 40%. This test will be undertaken at the one-
sided 0.025 level.  
Time to Response, Durability of Response, and Survival time will be presented using Kaplan-Meier 
curves with medians calculated if available. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals will be calculated 
for the median for each of these endpoints.  
For maintenance of response achieved any time during study until EoT and beyond (including data 
collected in the long-term follow-up study NI-0501-05) different follow-up periods will be considered, 
firstly censoring at i) EoT and ii) the day prior to starting conditioning; and secondly by taking the 
complete follow-up period beyond HSCT. 
Additional endpoints based on binary outcomes including number of patients who reduce glucocorticoids 
by 50% or more, and number of patients able to proceed to HSCT will be converted to proportions and 
associated 95% confidence intervals calculated. 
Statistical significance in terms of p-values will only be obtained for the primary endpoint in both the ITT 
and PP analysis sets. All other endpoints will be viewed as supportive for the primary endpoint and as a 
consequence no formal hierarchy of endpoints will be declared. 
Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 59 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL 11.3.2  Safety Data 
All data relating to safety will be listed and summarized using descriptive statistics.  
AEs will be coded and tabulated by body system, and by individual events within each body system. AEs 
will also be tabulated by severity and relationship to the study medication. Summaries will also be 
produced of SAEs and AEs leading to withdrawal from the study. 
For each clinical laboratory test, individual patient values will be listed and summarized and change from 
pre-treatment baseline values calculated and summarized. Any values outside the standard reference 
range will be flagged. Summaries of marked abnormalities and shift tables will be tabulated for each 
laboratory test. 
In addition, other exploratory analyses of safety data, including summaries for different subsets of 
patients, may be conducted. 
11.3.3  Pharmacodynamic Data 
All PD data will be summarized using appropriate graphical and tabular presentations. 
Exploratory statistical models will be fitted, and correlation analyses undertaken, to investigate the 
relationships between PD data and other biomarkers and the clinical measures of response. ROC curves 
may be used to summarize any relationships that are found. 
In addition, other exploratory analyses of pharmacodynamic endpoints, including summaries for different 
subsets of patients, may be conducted. 
11.3.4  Immunogenicity Data 
The numbers of patients with anti-drug antibodies present at each assessment point will be summarized. 
11.3.5  Missing Data 
No imputations of missing data will be performed.  However, the following rules will be applied to 
ensure that all patients can be included in the final analysis: 
 Patients who are withdrawn from the study prior to Week 8 because of safety concerns or poor 
efficacy will be classified as non-responders from the time of their withdrawal in all analyses of 
response status, and their data will be censored at time of withdrawal in all time- to-event 
analyses. For continuous endpoints in such patients, all analyses for time points beyond the point 
of withdrawal will exclude missing data for these patients.  
 Patients who do not reach Week 8 because of early transplant will be classified as responders 
beyond their time of withdrawal in all analyses of response status, and their data will be censored 
at time of withdrawal.  
11.4 REPLACEMENT POLICY 
11.4.1  For Patients 
Any patient withdrawn from the study for reasons other than safety or efficacy concerns will be replaced. 
11.4.2  For Centers 
A center may be replaced for the following administrative reasons: excessively slow recruitment, poor 
protocol adherence.

12 ETHICAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS 
12.1 GOOD CLINICAL PRACTI CE 
The procedures set out in this study protocol pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and documentation of 
this study are designed to ensure that NovImmune, its authorized representative, and investigator abide 
by Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as described in International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) 
Guideline E6 and in accordance with the general ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of 
Helsinki. The study will receive approval from an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) prior to commencement and where applicable by law also from National Competent 
Authorities. The Investigator will conduct all aspects of this study in accordance with applicable national, 
state, and local laws of the pertinent regulatory authorities. 
12.2 RESPONSIBILITIES 
Investigator 
The Investigator should ensure that all persons assisting with the trial are appropriately qualified and 
adequately informed about the protocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study-related duties 
and functions. The Investigator should maintain a list of sub-investigators and other appropriately 
qualified persons to whom he or she has delegated significant study-related duties. 
The Investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all patients (or their legally authorized 
representative) who sign an informed consent document and are screened for entry into the study. 
Patients who fail screening must have the reason(s) recorded in their source documents and the study-
screening log. 
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigators’ staff, must be available during monitoring 
visits, audits and inspections to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject s’ records 
(e.g. medical/hospital records, office charts, hospital charts, and study related charts) for source data and 
other type of verification. The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of CRFs and 
queries. 
12.3 CONSENT 
Before being admitted to the clinical study, the patient must consent to participate after the nature, scope, 
and possible consequences of the clinical study have been explained in a form understandable to him or 
her. An informed consent document that includes both information about the study and the consent form 
will be prepared and given to the patient. This document will contain all ICH, GCP, and locally required 
regulatory elements (whichever is more stringent). The document must be in a language understandable 
to the patient and must specify who informed the patient, and when the informed consent was obtained.  
Information to patients will be split into a Patient Information Sheet that provides detailed information 
about the trial and its benefits and risks, and the Informed Consent Form that summarizes the content of 
the Patient Information Sheet and is used to obtain the dated signature from the patient as evidence of the 
patient’s agreement to partake in the study. 
If applicable, since minors are involved in the trial, assent must be obtained from the minor and informed 
consent from at least one of the parents or as mandated by local rules (individual or judicial or other body 
authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective patient to the patient’s participation 
in the procedures involved in the research). The language used in the Assent Form is adapted to the 
Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 61 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL maturity level of the minor involved in the trial. Since minors of different age groups are likely to be 
entered into the trial different versions of the Assent Form will be provided. The modalities for obtaining 
informed consent from the parents and Assent from the minor will be defined at the site initiation visit 
and documented in the clinical trial center Trial Master File (TMF). 
After reading and understanding the informed consent document, the patient (or their legally authorized 
representative) must give consent in writing. The written informed consent will be obtained prior to 
conducting any study-related procedures or tests. The patient’s consent (or the consent of the patient’s 
legally authorized representative) must be confirmed at the time of consent by the personally dated 
signature of the person conducting the informed consent discussions. A copy of the signed consent 
document must be given to the patient or their legally authorized representative. The Investigator will 
retain the original signed consent document. The Investigator will not undertake any measures 
specifically required only for the clinical study until valid consent has been obtained. 
If an amended protocol impacts the content of the informed consent document, the consent document 
must be revised. Patients already participating in the study when the amended protocol is implemented 
must be re-consented with the revised version of the informed consent document. A copy of the revised 
informed consent document must be given to the patient or their legally authorized representative. The 
Investigator will retain the original signed updated consent document in the study files. 
12.4 CONFIDENTIALITY AND DATA PRIVACY 
NovImmune affirms the patient's right to protection against invasion of privacy and to be in compliance 
with ICH and other local regulations (whichever is more stringent). NovImmune requires the Investigator 
to permit NovImmune representatives and when necessary, representatives from regulatory authorities, to 
review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in accordance with local laws (any copies of 
patients’ records must be dul y anonymiz ed to protect patients’ confidentiality). 
Should direct access to medical records require a waiver or authorization separate from the patient’s 
statement of informed consent, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain such permission in 
writing from the appropriate individual. 
12.5 PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS 
Substantial amendments will be submitted to the IRB/IEC for written approval and where applicable to 
National Competent Authorities. Written approval must be obtained before implementation of the

Based on the evidence accumulated during the past years, it can be concluded that the over-production of 
IFNγ in HLH patients has a pivotal pathogenic role in this disease. Based on the key role played by IFN  
in the HLH, the investigation of the use of an anti-IFN  mAb in HLH is deemed justified. 
NI-0501 is a fully human anti-IFNγ monoclonal antibody (mAb) which binds and neutralizes IFNγ. The 
dose of NI-0501 required for reaching and maintaining over time a certain percentage of inhibition of 
IFNγ depends on the amount of IFNγ produced, circulating as well as present in tissues. The NI-0501 
concentrations that inhibit the effect of IFNγ and the doses that reach and maintain these NI-
0501concentrations have been predicted. 
 
 
Figure 2 :  Schematic representation of the interaction between IFNγ, NI-0501 and CXCL9 
Figure 1 schematically represents the intended interaction between IFNγ and NI-0501. In HLH patients, 
the production of IFNγ (red) is exacerbated and leads to high circulating concentrations of free IFNγ. NI-
0501 (blue) can be administered to these patients with the goal to bind to free IFNγ and reduce its 
concentration and consequently its damaging effects. The binding of NI-0501 to IFNγ leads to the 
production of an IFNγ- NI-0501 complex (violet) which is in equilibrium with the free moieties. To 
confirm the neutralization of IFNγ by NI-0501, the decrease in serum concentration of CXCL-9 (green), 
one of the cytokines specifically produced through the activation of the IFNγ receptor, can be monitored. 
All the components described above (i.e. free IFNγ, free NI-0501, IFNγ- NI-0501 complex and CXCL-9) 
have their own intrinsic clearance and their concentrations correspond to an equilibrium between 
production and elimination. Furthermore, for NI-0501, the formation of the complex corresponds to an 
additional target mediated clearance proportional to the IFNγ production. In HLH patients receiving NI-
0501, serum concentrations of free NI-0501, total IFNγ (i.e. free IFNγ + IFNγ- NI-0501 complex) and 
CXCL-9 have been measured.  
Data from in vitro experiments investigating the binding of NI-0501 to human IFNγ and the functional 
inhibition of human IFNγ by NI-0501 have been used for predicting the concentrations of NI-0501 that 
inhibit (e.g., 99%) the effect of circulating IFNγ concentrations. The results indicate that these NI-0501 
concentrations highly depend on the IFNγ concentrations themselves.  
Based on the calculated neutralizing concentrations of NI-0501 (e.g., for 99% inhibition of the effect of a 
baseline IFNγ concentration of 0.1 nM, 3400 pg/mL), on the PK parameters of NI-0501 in Healthy 
Volunteers and on the PK information from recombinant IFNγ in human, predictions were performed 
Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 70 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL regarding the dose that would inhibit in the majority of patients the effect of circulating and newly 
formed IFNγ over a period of 3 days (i.e. dosing interval). Based on these predictions, the starting dose in 
HLH patients was determined to be 1 mg/kg. This dose, predicted to inhibit for 3 days at least 99% of 
IFNγ effect in patients with baseline IFNγ concentrations lower or equal to 3400 pg/mL, was mainly 
driven by the estimated production of IFNγ which impacts the clearance of NI-0501 and varies 
considerably between patients as already indicated by the wide range of baseline IFNγ concentrations 
observed in HLH patients. 
The originally planned dosing strategy foresaw that, after the initial administration of NI-0501 at 1 
mg/kg, the dose could have been adapted depending on PK and clinical response (fever and 
thrombocytopenia), with clinical response overriding PK, in case of a favorable response to treatment.  
The rationale for choosing the initial interval of administration of 3 days for the pilot Phase 2 study, at 
least until steady state has been achieved, was based on the expected need to adjust in a short period of 
time and in an informed manner the dose of NI-0501.  
The selection of an interval of administration of 3 days has allowed: 
- Having a fast initial assessment of the patient’s PK (concentration measured at the end of NI-0501 
infusion, 24 h and 48 h post infusion), confirming, after the first dose, whether the assumptions used in 
the mathematical Models were correct. The PK samples mentioned above have been analyzed so far in 
a timely manner, so that the results were available for an informed decision on the selection of the 
subsequent dose to be administered (provided no safety concerns and no worsening were observed); 
- The possibility to rapidly adjust the dose of NI-0501 depending on PK and clinical response; 
- Overcoming the expected effect of TMDD of IFNγ turnover on the bioavailability of NI-0501 in HLH 
patients; 
- To avoid in patient with high clearance due to TMDD to have high peak and trough fluctuations which 
would have been the case with longer dosing intervals. 
- To satisfy the request of the Scientific Steering Committee of the study to ensure a fast and safe dose 
finding process in this fragile and severe patient population, in parallel to the close laboratory and 
clinical monitoring of patients. 
Data gathered so far in the Phase 2 study have shown that an initial dose regimen of 1 mg/kg every 3 days 
was appropriate to obtain a rapid onset of NI-0501 effects on HLH parameters in the majority of the 
patients treated so far. However, it has also been observed that in patients having a high production of 
IFNγ, evidenced by high circulating total IFNγ concentrations, a higher dose of NI-0501 was required,  
demonstrating the presence of  a target mediated drug disposition (TMDD) with NI -0501 . This 
phenomenon has shown to induce a pronounced increased clearance of NI -0501 due to  the high 
production of IFNγ. The presence of TMDD, while requiring the administration  of NI -0501 doses higher 
than 1 mg/kg, prevent s NI-0501 accumulation to occur . 
Based on experience gained from the first 16 evaluable primary HLH patients treated with NI-0501, and 
the excellent safety and tolerability profile of NI-0501, the possibility that a dose increase could be 
required at different times during treatment has been confirmed and therefore a standardized approach to 
guide dose changes has been introduced through this amendment. 
From the available data it has also been possible to estimate  the total production of IFNγ in HLH patients.  
In fact, it is not possible to estimate the total amount of a given cytokine produced in the body simply 
based on its free circulating concentrations. However, once an anti-IFNγ antibody is administered, it 
moves from the circulation to tissues and organs where it binds to IFNγ, and then returns into circulation. 
It is at this point that the amount of IFNγ bound to the antibody and present in blood reflects the total 
production of IFNγ. This is what we measure as “Total IFNγ” ( Finkelman and Morris, 1999 ). Applying 
this principle, from a preliminary analysis of the data from the Phase 2 study, it can be concluded that the 
production rate of IFNγ is extremely high in patients with HLH, as demonstr ated by the elevated 
concentrations of total IFNγ detected in the vast majority of the HLH patients receiving NI -0501

main source of the produced IFNγ.  
A significant INFγ production was present in all patients in whom a dose increase was applied during the 
ongoing Phase 2 study. Importantly, it was also demonstrated that the production of IFNγ can vary during 
the course of the disease, particularly influenced by the presence of infections, as proven by the high 
inter- and intra-patient variability of IFNγ levels (from 1 to 10,000 pM) shown in the patients treated so 
far with NI-050 1  (Figure 2).

Concentrations before day 3 are omitted because there are not yet at steady state. 
All this taken together, in protocol Version 5 of study NI-0501-04, after the initial administration of 1 
mg/kg of NI-0501, dose adjustments can be applied. In particular, a dose increase to 3 mg/kg (and, if 
needed, to 6 mg/kg) will be possible according to pre -defined criteria guided by clinical and laboratory 
response in each patient (see Table 4 and Appendix B).  
Infusions will be performed every 3 days until SD15 (infusion #6), and twice per week thereafter. 
Elongation of the dosing interval to 1 week can occur only after the first 4 weeks of treatment, if the 
patient has achieved and maintained Complete Response for at least 1 week. Dose increases to 3 and 6 
mg/kg are possible at any time during the study. More than 4 administrations at 6 mg/kg, or the 
introduction of a dose higher than 6 mg/kg may be proposed by the Investigator based on a positive 
benefit/risk assessment. However, the implementation of the above has to be discussed and approved by 
the Data Monitoring Committee after thorough assessment of available data, including PK and PD.

Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL Predictions to guide the initial and subsequent NI-0501 doses in HLH patients 
 The original calculation of the first NI-0501 dose in HLH patients was based on: 
 The affinity of NI-0501 for human IFNγ (Report NI-0501-MIF-01) 
 Inhibition of human IFNγ-induced STAT-1 induction by NI-0501 (Report NI-0501-
PHARMACO-01) 
 NI-0501 population pharmacokinetic parameters estimated in Healthy Volunteers (SAD study 
NI-0501-03) (Modeling and Simulation support to NI-0501: PK analysis of study NI-0501-003) 
(Draft Report available) 
 Literature information on the in vivo PK of recombinant IFNγ in human 
(http://www.drugs.com/pro/actimmune.html ) 
The data from the in vitro  experiments have been used for predicting the NI-0501 concentrations that 
inhibit up to 90 or 99% the effect of high IFNγ concentrations (i.e. 0.1 and 0.01 nM) (Fig. 3, Table 1 ).

- Two levels of IFNγ (0.1 and 0.01 nM) are simulated with two levels of inhibition each (99%, i.e. EFF1F = 
0.01 and 90%, i.e. EFF2F = 0.1).

Based on the predicted IFNγ-neutralizing concentrations of NI-0501 (Table 1), on PK parameters of NI-
0501 in healthy volunteers and on PK parameters from recombinant IFNγ in human, calculations were 
performed to predict the doses that inhibit the effect of circulating and newly formed IFNγ up to 99% 
over a period of 3 days (dosing interval) in HLH patients ( Table 6 ).

Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 75 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL Based on the predicted ‘IFNγ-neutralizing’ doses of NI-0501 presented in Table 6 , the proposed starting 
dose in HLH patients was 1 mg/kg. During the Phase 2 study (Study NI-0501-04 Protocol Version 4), due 
to the uncertainty in the predictions, especially from the target mediated drug disposition effect of IFN γ 
turnover on the clearance of NI-0501 in HLH patients, subsequent doses could be adapted based on NI-
0501 concentrations measured at the end of the infusion (C end infusion ) and at subsequent time-points (e.g., 
24h (C 24h)/48h (C 48h) after administration and on clinical response. The observed concentrations and their 
ratios were compared to predicted concentrations and ratios obtained from the population PK model of 
NI-0501 in Healthy Volunteers after allometric scaling and assuming linear (i.e. without TMDD see 
Figure 4 and 5 top graphs) or non-linear (i.e. with TMDD see 4 and 5 bottom graphs) kinetics. If the 
observed concentrations and ratios were markedly low and below predicted reference values (see Figure 
4, and 5, and Table 3), marked TMDD could be assumed and a dose increase could be recommended. 
Figure 6 shows the predictions of NI-0501 concentration-time profiles after the first administration of 1 
mg/kg NI-0501 in HLH patients. 
Prior to the initiation of the NI-0501-04 study, it was established that during treatment with NI-0501, the 
minimal NI-0501 concentration to be achieved should have been the one required to neutralize 0.1 nmol 
of INFγ for 3 days, while the initial maximal concentration (“ceiling”) should have not exceeded an 
arbitrary concentration corresponding to the median maximal concentration reached in Healthy 
Volunteers following the single administration of the NI-0501 at the highest dose tested (3 mg/kg). The 
experience gathered during the conduct of the Phase 2 study has allowed to determine that, in the 
presence of a high INFγ production, there is fast clearance of NI-0501 (TMDD) and NI-0501 dose 
increases greater than 3 mg/kg are required.  
So far, during the conduct of the study, as well as in patients receiving NI-0501 in Compassionate Use, 
the safety and tolerability profile of NI-0501 was very good. In particular, to date, in no circumstances an 
increase in the NI-0501 dose was associated with the occurrence of safety concerns. No SAEs related to 
NI-0501 and no increased severity or frequency of non-serious AEs was reported.  All infusions were 
uneventful.  
Taking all these data together, it can be concluded that, applying the dosing strategy proposed for the 
continuation of the Phase 2 study as a Phase 2/3 study, HLH patients will be exposed to NI-0501 
concentrations already achieved during the Phase 2 study, a t which  no safety concern has emerged to date 
and well w ithin the exposure achieved during the toxicology studies, with a safety margin of approx. 7.5 
as to Cmax . In particular, as the administration of more than 4 NI -0501 doses at 6 mg/kg can only occur 
after a review of the PK and PD data, the possibility tha t an accumulation of NI -0501 occurs is to be 
excluded.

Method 
The PK model used in the simulations below is a two compartment model with linear elimination 
assuming allometric scaling based on body weight (BW) to which an additional non-linear (TMDD) 
elimination pathway characterized by a VMAX and a KM has been added.  
Parameters used in the simulations are from a population pharmacokinetic analysis of study NI-0501-03 
and assuming allometric scaling. VMAX is the IFNγ concentration (0.1 nM) multiplied by the 
recombinant IFNγ clearance (1.2 L/h/kg) divided by the number of binding sites (1 for model 1 or 1.58 
for model 2, Table 4) per antibody. KM is assumed to be equal to KD. 
CL  = 0.00737*(BW/70)+0.75 L/h  
V1  = 3.03*((BW/70)+1) L 
Q  = 0.0218*(BW/70)+0.75 L/h  
V2  = 2.98*(BW/70)+1 L 
VMAX = 0.12*BW nmol/h (model 1) or 0.076*BW nmol/h (model 2) 
KM  = 0.0014 nM (considered to be approximately the same for both 
                models 1 and 2 and other VMAX values) 
 
The VMAX value of 0.076 nmol/h/kg from model 2 is considered to be pivotal for the dose of 1 mg/kg 
NI-0501. At higher VMAX, the dose of 1 mg/kg NI-0501 is predicted not to optimally neutralize the 
effect of IFNγ 0.1 nM. 
On the graphs: 
The pink lines represent the median NI-0501 maximum concentration observed in study NI-0501-03 
(SAD study) for the highest dose tested 3 mg/kg (78508 ng/mL or 533.85 nM).The red lines represent 
total NI-0501 concentration (40 ng/mL or 0.272 nM) that inhibits 99% of IFNγ (free concentration of 
3400 pg/mL or 0.1 nM) in blood. The orange lines indicate the reference values on day 2 for model 2 
with VMAX=0.076 nmol/h/kg.

Interim (up to December 2, 2015) PK-PD data from studies NI-0501-04 and NI-0501-05 in HLH patients 
and in Compassionate Use patients receiving NI-0501 have been analysed in order to explore the 
structural and quantitative relationships between NI-0501, total IFNγ (free + complex with NI-0501) and 
CXCL-9 a chemonokine specifically induced by IFNγ.  
The results of this PK-PD exploratory analysis indicated that: 
- CXCL-9 concentration is a good surrogate of IFNγ activity. In patients treated with NI-0501, CXCL- 9 
concentrations depend on the total IFNγ concentration (free + complex with NI-0501) and free 
concentration of NI-0501. 
- Total IFNγ concentration at steady-state is an expression of IFNγ production: the higher the total 
concentration of IFNγ in serum, the higher the IFNγ production. 
- Total IFNγ concentration/production in HLH patients shows a high inter- and intra-individual 
variability. 
- The kinetics of NI-0501 in HLH patients show target mediated disposition: 
o At total IFNγ concentration lower than 300 pM the kinetics of NI-0501 is rather linear. 
o At total IFNγ concentration higher than 300 pM the clearance of NI-0501 increases to become 
proportional to the total IFNγ concentration/ production. 
- The higher the total concentration of IFNγ in serum: 
o The higher the concentration of NI-0501 to neutralize IFNγ (evidenced by a higher CXCL9 
concentration to inhibit). 
o The higher the dose of NI-0501 to reach the neutralizing concentration of IFNγ (evidenced by a 
higher target mediated clearance of NI-0501). 
Study NI- 0501 -04 NI-0501 in Primary HLH Page 80 of 96 
Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL Although the PK/PD analysis performed so far was based on interim data, and for this reason it should be 
considered exploratory, the derived information is deemed enough explanatory to guide the selection of a 
safe and efficacious dosing algorithm of NI-0501 in HLH, allowing to perform explorative simulations  to 
anticipate the exposure to be expected if the proposed new dosing strategy would be applied.  
These quantitative findings have been used to evaluate an amended dosing strategy of NI-0501 in HLH 
patients. The goal of the adapted dosing strategy is to allow dose increases based on clinical judgment 
only in patients who deteriorate or have no clinical improvement after the first administration(s) of NI-
0501 at 1 mg/kg/3days.  
To evaluate the impact of these dose increases on concentration levels, simulations have been performed. 
In these simulations, a time aggressive scheme consisting of increasing the dose from 1 to 3 mg/kg on 
day 3 and, if necessary, to 6 mg/kg on day 6 have been simulated. The doses were assumed to be given 
every 3 days till day 15 and afterwards bi-weekly (intervals of 4 and 3 days). Since patients with 
insufficient response are potentially patients with significant levels of total IFNγ productions, simulations 
have been performed with different clearance levels based on the estimated correlation that exists 
between NI-0501 clearance and total IFNγ and for various plausible levels of total IFNγ concentrations as 
observed in study NI-0501-04 and NI-0501-05 (see Figure 7 below).

Protocol NI-0501 -04-US-P-IND#111015 Version 5.1 – March 24, 2016 CONFIDENTIAL Figure 7:    Simulated NI-0501 serum concentrations as a function of time for different dosing and 
total IFNγ concentration scenarios. Doses are administered every 3 days till day 15 and bi-weekly 
afterwards. Dose regimens are: 1 mg/kg from day 0 (1 mg/kg); 1 mg/kg on day 0 followed by 3 
mg/kg from day 3 on (3 mg/kg); 1 mg/kg on day 0 followed by 3 mg/kg on day 3 and followed by 6 
mg/kg from day 6 on (6 mg/kg). Simulations are performed using PK parameters from patients 
assuming total IFNγ concentrations of 1000 pM (A), 3000 pM (B) and 10000 pM (C). The blue 
shaded area represents the interval between the highest (i.e. mean of the 3 highest values in the 
database) peak and trough NI-0501 concentrations observed so far in studies NI-0501-04 and NI-
0501-05 in HLH patients and in Compassionate Use patients. 
 
Although patients receiving 3 and 6 mg/kg will have significantly higher concentrations , as observed in 
study NI-0501-04 and NI-0501-05, patients who usually require higher doses are patients with increased 
clearance due to high circulating IFNγ. Patients who will probably be subject to a dose increase to 3 
mg/kg are most likely patients with a total IFNγ concentration around 1000 pM and patients who will 
require a dose increase to 6 mg/kg are most likely patients with total IFNγ concentration higher than 3000 
pM. 
Predictions for the proposed NI-0501 dose increase to 6 mg/kg as allowed in Version 5 of the NI-0501 
study protocol are represented in Figure 8 below.

dose increase  to 6 mg/kg allowed in Version 5 of the NI-0501-04 study protocol and for a constant 
total IFNγ concentration of 1000 pM. The simulated dosing regimen is: 1 mg/kg on day 0; 3 mg/kg 
on days 3 and 6; 6 mg/kg on days 9, 12, 15 and 18, followed by 3 mg/kg on day 21 and then bi-
weekly (e.g., days 24, 28, 31, 35). The blue shaded area represents the interval between the highest 
(i.e. mean of the 3 highest values in the database) peak and trough NI-0501 concentrations  
observed so far in studies NI-0501-04 and NI-0501-05 in HLH patients and in Compassionate Use 
patients.  
 
  
In conclusion, since dose increases will most probably occur in patients with increased clearance due to a 
high production of IFNγ, the exposure will be less than dose proportional and is predicted to remain 
within (or close to) the concentration range that has already been observed in study NI-0501-04 and NI-
0501-05 .

This document has the objective of: 
1. guiding the Investigator on the clinical and laboratory parameters for the assessment on 
whether NI-0501 dose has to be increased 
2. giving a clear overview of the decision making process for dose increase during the study. 
Figure 1 gives an example  of the flow for assessing a potential NI-0501 dose increase occurring at the 
start of the study.  
 
Figure 1 – Flow -chart of the decision making process on dose increase  
 
 
Please note : 
- Dose increase may occur any time during the study, if the clinical and laboratory criteria reported 
on SD6 are met.  
- When NI -0501 dose  is increased to 6 mg/kg, a maximum of four infusions at this dose levels will 
be administered. Thereafter, reassessment needs  to occur by the Investigator and the DMC, in 
order to establish the appropriate regimen  for continuation of NI -0501 t reatment (see below)

MANAGEMENT OF THE PATIENTS AFTER NI -0501 DOSE  INCREAS E TO  6 mg/kg 
After the patient has received four infusions at the dose of 6 mg/kg with a regular monitoring of the 
clinical and laboratory HLH parameters, a thorough assessment has to be made by the Investigator with 
regard to: 
- clinical and laboratory response criteria presented in Table 4 and Figure 1 
- PK and PD data available  
 
If clinical and laboratory response criteria are no longer applicable, the dose of NI-0501 will be decreased 
back to 3 mg/kg. 
On the other hand, if criteria still apply, based on careful benefit/risk assessment, the Investigator may 
propose either 
i) to continue treatment at 6 mg/kg for additional infusions  
        or  
ii) to increase NI-0501 dose above 6 mg/kg, if PK and PD evidence indicates extremely high IFN  levels 
and, consequently, fast NI-0501 elimination. 
However, the Investigator ’s propos al of either continuing 6 mg/kg infusions or increasing the dose above 
6 mg/kg has to be discussed and approved by the DMC, after thorough assessment of all available data , 
including PK and PD.

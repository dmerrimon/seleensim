1.1 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.2 Background  Information  
Transgender  men (TM) are at high -risk for acquiring  HIV. Growing  research  on TM 
clearly demonstrates  increased HIV risk and burden,  although  not as much  risk in  comparison to 
transgender  women  among  whom  risk and vulnerability  to HIV/STIs  has been  better  described,  but 
considerably higher than the general US population. A recent  review was among the first  to 
systematically estimate HIV risk  and burden  in TM in the US.  In this review,  there was a high 
prevalence  of HIV (3.2%;  lab confirmed)  and high rates of  HIV-risk behaviors,  such as  sex work  
(13.1%) and unprotected sexual  intercourse (24.5%),  which have been strongly  associated with  
HIV acquisition(1).  Although the prevalence of  HIV is lower  in TM as  compared  to transgender  
women,  having mainly  female sexual partners might  partially explain  the comparatively  lower  HIV 
prevalence  among  TM. Previously  undescribed  HIV risk behaviors  and contextual  factorspoint  
to the immediate  need  for the development  and testing  of HIV prevention  interventions  
among  YTM.  More specifically,  the overall  estimate for STI diagnoses for  TM was 28.7%.  Co- 
morbid  infection with bacterial  STIs increases the risk of  transmission and acquisition of HIV(2,  3), 
and it has been  well established  that STIs play an important  role in HIV infections  among  cisgender  
YMSM(4).  Further,  prevalence  of drug use was high with 38.1%  of TM reporting  illicit 
drug use. 
Importantly,  in our community -based  sample  of 565 TM in NYC,  HIV prevalence  among  TM 
who have  sex with cisgender  men only was 11.8%  as compared  to 3.5%  for TM who have  sex with 
cisgender men and other  partners,  and 2.1% for TM who have sex with cisgender women  only.  
These data  suggest  the potential for alarmingly high rates  of HIV in TM who  have sex  with 
cisgender men  in urban settings,  which  has not  been  previously described  and speaks directly  to 
the public health significance of  the proposed  research.  
Stigma  and discrimination  have  contributed  to disparities  in access  to healthcare  
services  for TM.  Studies  show  TM experience a high burden of discrimination in multiple settings,  
including  healthcare settings(5,  6). In a large study of  TM adults,  33% of  the sample delayed  
needed medical care  when sick  or injured,  and 39% delayed routine  preventive  care.  Stigma and  
discrimination  among  TM make  it less likely  for them  to seek  sexual  healthcare(7).  Low knowledge  
of PrEP(1),  low rates  of PrEP  access(8),  and low uptake  of PrEP(9)  among  TM suggests  the strong  
need  for the development  of health  prevention  interventions  delivered  outside  of traditional

 healthcare  settings.  
Despite  biomedical  advances  in HIV prevention,  there  remains  a dearth  of evidence - 
based,  sexual  health  HIV prevention  interventions  for TM. More  than four decades  into the HIV 
epidemic,  the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) compendium  of 
evidence - based interventions  (EBIs) for  HIV prevention has no evidence -based interventions  for  
YTM . This  underscores  the need  for behavioral HIV/STI prevention interventions targeted  to YTM  
to avert  new infections given their  increased risk in  comparison to the general  population.  
Therefore,  there is a critical  need  to develop  and test  the efficacy  of HIV prevention interventions  
for YTM,  especially those under  18 years of  age. We comprehensively looked at the existing EBIs  
and considered adaptation of  those developed for adolescent  females,  those with  family based - 
approaches,  those designed to target  racial/ethnic groups,  or those developed for MSM;  however,  
we decided  on using  the MyPEEPS  intervention  framework  because  we have  preliminary  data 
suggesting  that YTM  find the intervention  to be very usable.  Specific  areas  that are needed  for 
developing  this intervention  for YTM  have  been  identified  that can be achieved  through  Aim 1 of 
this proposed  study.  
MyPEEPS  (Male  Youth  Pursuing  Empowerment,  Education,  and Prevention  around  
Sexuality)  is, to our knowledge,  the only theoretically -driven  intervention  in the published  
literature  which  has been  tested  in YMSM  under  age 18 years  and developed  with strong  
formative  work  among  a diverse  group  of YMSM.  MyPEEPS  (R34MH079707 ; PI: Garofalo)  was 
originally  developed  as a manualized  curriculum  consisting  of 6 interactive  group  sessions  (2 hours  
each),  delivered twice weekly for 3 weeks.  MyPEEPS  was developed and tested among  diverse  
YMSM  ages  16-20 years, including  Black, Latino, and  White  YMSM. The MyPEEPS  intervention   
targets  social -cognitive  and cognitive -behavioral factors  based  on best  practices for  behavior  
change,  emotion  regulation,  and HIV intervention  (e.g., knowledge, self -efficacy,  and behavioral  
skills) within  YMSM -specific  social  contexts.  The MyPEEPS  scenarios include, for  example,  those  
involving emotionally  activating and cognitively complex  situations  involving for  partner -specific  
factors  (e.g.,  older  partners),  experiences  of social  stigmatization (e.g.,  by race  and/or  sexual  
orientation),  and sexualized  contexts  (e.g.,  online  sexual  partner  interaction,  under  the influence  of 
alcohol  or drugs) and  specifically  address  emotional  regulation  and minority  stress which  are 
salient  issues facing adolescents at  risk for acquiring HIV.  Building  on this work,  our study team  
translated  the MyPEEPS  intervention  onto a mobile  platform  for a slightly  younger  age group,  ages  
13-18 years,  with content  delivered through YMSM avatars (e.g.,  caricature  or graphic identity)  
whose  profiles  and problems  are based  on the formative  research  of the original  pilot trial and who 
manage their sexual health against  a backdrop of  personal,  family -based,  and relational  
challenges.  We are now  testing MyPEEPS Mobile in a national  randomized trial  of 761 cisgender  
YMSM  (U01MD011279; MPIs: Schnall  and Garofalo)  with interim  analysis  (n=350) supporting  
preliminary efficacy  (see Preliminary  Studies).  
 
Benefits  of mHealth  in HIV prevention  interventions.  As part of  a comprehensive  strategy  
across the  continuum of  HIV prevention and  care,  behavioral  interventions  remain an important  
tool in the fight  against  HIV(10).  While many HIV prevention interventions have been delivered  
face-to-face,  the emergence of  eHealth as a platform  for health behavior change provides new  
opportunities  for developing  HIV prevention  strategies(11).  eHealth  is a generic  term that applies  to 
an increasingly  large  number  of electronically  delivered  interventions and  can include  web-based  
tools including videos,  games,  chat rooms,  and social  networking sites  as well  as text/SMS  and e - 
mail messaging  (12). Schnall  et al. conducted  a review  of eHealth  HIV prevention  interventions  in

 MSM  and found preliminary  evidence that  eHealth (e.g., SMS,  web-based education  modules)  
improves HIV  prevention behaviors  in MSM  but has not  been  widely developed  for or tested  in 
adolescents(13).  Studies  have  also shown  that eHealth  HIV prevention  interventions  developed  for 
adult  MSM(14 -17) are appealing  because  of their privacy  feature  and convenience  of use(18).  
Therefore,  delivery  of MyPEEPS  using  mobile  technology  has the potential  to remove  many  
of the barriers  to engagement  in YTM  and improve  scalability (19). We will adopt  recent  
recommendations  for planning of  scale  up of  efficacious mHealth  HIV prevention interventions,  
including formation of  a scale -up working  group,  which  will meet  regularly to formulate  
recommendations  for future scale up should the  intervention proveefficacious.  
In summary , this application  proposes  to intervene  on a population,  YTM,  among  whom  evidence  
of HIV risk is emerging  and increasingly  well-documented,  at an age (15-25 years)  of increasing  
vulnerability  by building on our existing MyPEEPS mobile intervention and developing an  
intervention  specific  to the needs  of YTM.  The proposed  mHealth  approach  is well-suited  to both 
reach  this relatively hidden population and,  if efficacious,  scale  widely.  
 
1.3 Specific  Aims  
 
 
1) Using  qualitative  methodology,  expert  feedback,  and usability  assessments,  develop  
MyPEEPS  Mobile  for YTM.  
2) Conduct  a pilot randomized  controlled trial  to examine  the feasibility,  acceptability,  and 
preliminary  efficacy  of the revised  MyPEEPS  Mobile  App in a sample  of 80 YTM  (15-25 years)  
and refine the  study methods  for a future  efficacy  trial. 
3) Assess  predisposing,  enabling,  and reinforcing  factors  for MyPEEPS  Mobile  among  YTM  
through  theoretically -guided  in-depth  interviews.  
 
1.4 Preliminary  Research  
 
a) Development  and Pilot  Testing  of the MyPEEPS  Intervention  (R34MH079707;  PI: 
Garofalo) . MyPEEPS  is a social and  behavioral  theory -driven  HIV prevention intervention  
for diverse  YMSM, developed by members  of our research  team,  (Garofalo [MPI],  Kuhns  
[Co-I]), using  a multi -stage, mixed -method  approach.  MyPEEPS  was based on  the Social - 
Personal  Framework  (Figure  1) (20) and added  important  psychosocial  and contextual  risk 
factors  to YMSM  risk-taking. The  MyPEEPS  pilot study  evaluated  the initial  efficacy,  
feasibility,  and acceptability in an  ethnically  diverse sample (N=101),  including MSM under  
age 18 years,  using a randomized controlled  design with an active,  time-matched  control  
group.  There  were  no significant  differences  between arms  with regard  to demographic  
characteristics.  Sexual  risk and social  cognitive  outcomes were assessed  at baseline,  6-, 
and 12-weeks post -intervention.  Over the entire follow -up period,  intervention  participants  
were  less likely  than controls  to engage  in any sexual  behavior  while  under  the influence  of 
substances  (p<.05),  and a decreasing trend  in unprotected anal sex while  under  the 
influence of  substances  was also  observed in this group (p = .08), which is an important  
risk factor  for acquiring  HIV(21).  Thus,  the MyPEEPS  intervention,  a 6-session  behavioral  
intervention  tailored  to YMSM  ages  16-20 years,  was shown  to be feasible,  acceptable,  and 
demonstrated evidence of  preliminary efficacy in reducing sexual risk,  specifically sexual  
risk while under the influence of  substances(22).

 b) The MyPEEPS  Mobile  Trial  (U01MD011279;  MPIs:  Schnall  and Garofalo).  Our current  
trial of 700 YMSM has  shown promising preliminary results.  First,  we have successfully  
reached  our recruitment  goals.  Second,  we conducted  an interim  analysis  for the purposes  
of report  to our Data and Safety Monitoring Board and evaluated the preliminary outcomes  
in the first half (N=350)  of our study  sample  from baseline  to 3-month  follow -up. Higher  self- 
efficacy for  HIV prevention behaviors  (p<.001) and more  recent  HIV tests in the  past 3 
months  (p=0.02)  were  reported  by the intervention  group  compared  to control.  The number  
of condomless  anal sex acts was lower  among  the intervention  group  for both insertive  anal 
sex acts (p=0.03)  and receptive  anal sex acts (p=0.0001).  These preliminary findings  were  
reported  to our Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  and are very promising  for supporting  the 
use of this intervention  for reducing  HIV risk behaviors  in YTM.  Finally,  and of great  
relevance  to this proposed  study,  over 800 YTM  screened  into our study  because  of their 
interest, sexual risk,  and behavioral vulnerability but  were ineligible based  on birth sex  
criteria.  We will use the list of transgender  men who we screened  as part of their larger  
efficacy  trial, as part  of our recruitment efforts for  the proposed R34 study.  Further,  we 
published  the findings  from our formative  work  in several  peer-reviewed  publications  and 
presentations(23 -27). 
c) In preparation  for this application,  we conducted  formative  focus  groups  with YTM.  
We conducted 6 focus  group sessions with  49 YTM from  4 sites (8 Birmingham, AL,  17 
Chicago, IL,  12 New  York, 11 Seattle,  WA).  In our sample of  49 YTM, 25 had  ever had  sex 
with a cisgender guy  and 11 had  sex with a transgender female  (e.g.,  sex designated  male  
at birth).  Over half  (27 of 49) feared disclosing  their status as a YTM to a doctor  or 
healthcare  provider,  demonstrating a key barrier to health seeking.  Only 24  (49%) had  
been  tested for HIV in  their lifetime.  Prior  to the focus group session,  all participants  
completed  all the MyPEEPS Mobile  activities  on their mobile phones  (e.g.,  the modules  
designed  for the cisgender YMSM in  our current  trial).  Findings from  the focus  group  
sessions  demonstrated the  perceived usefulness  of the intervention for  YTM,  but also   
highlighted  important  limitations . One participant  stated,  “But yes, it was super  realisticand  
just made  it less scary just  knowing  that you could  honestly  talk to someone  like that  
where  it’s totally  protected  and private.”  Another  youth  described  the usefulness  of the App 
and said,  “I wished I had found  out about  that sooner,  because  I had a STD scare  about  a 
year ago,  and I had to learn about  it in my doctor’s office  with my father there, which was  
absolutely  terrifying.”  We conducted a follow -up survey  after the participants used  the App  
to assess feasibility and acceptability; 82%  (N=40) agreed that  “Using  MyPEEPS willmake  
it easier  to make safer  decisions  about  their sexual  health” and “MyPEEPS gave them  
information and skills  needed to avoid  situations that  make  them uncomfortable and  put 
their sexual  health  at risk of HIV and other  STIs.”  However  salient,  limitations  to the current  
App content  highlighted the need for the  specific tailoring we propose herein,  targeting  
mechanisms  of risk specific  to YTM.  The specific  areas  that needed  to be addressed  were:  
1) content  related to family planning,  2) sex while transitioning,  3) body  parts,  4) body  type,  
5) gender  inclusivity,  6) addition  of TM and  gender  non-binary avatars,  7) social challenges  
such  as stigma,  violence,  mis-gendering,  and transphobia,  8) sexual/relational  power  
dynamics,  and 
9) educating their partners on  their gender identity.

 2.1 STUDY  DESIGN  
 
We propose to develop a mobile intervention for YTM  building on MyPEEPS Mobile, which was  
originally  developed  for very young  sexual  minority  men.  Central  to this intervention  is the premise  
that it will be  delivered  to youth  during  a developmental  period  that precedes  or coincides  with 
sexual  debut,  an important  time for intervention,  prior to or concurrent  with initiation of  high-risk 
behaviors.  Given both  the gap in  HIV prevention  science and the  lack of  current  targeted  
interventions,  and building upon  our multidisciplinary team’s  extensive experience in  HIV 
prevention,  mHealth,  behavioral  interventions,  randomized controlled trials,  and transgender  
health,  we propose  the following  specific  aims:  1) Using  qualitative  methodology,  expert  feedback,  
and usability  assessments,  develop  MyPEEPS Mobile  for YTM, 2)  Conduct a pilot randomized  
controlled  trial to examine  the feasibility,  acceptability,  and preliminary  efficacy  of the revised  
MyPEEPS  Mobile App  in a sample of 80 YTM (15 -25 years) and refine  the study methods  for a 
future  efficacy  trial, and  3) Assess  predisposing, enabling,  and reinforcing  factors  for MyPEEPS  
Mobile  among  YTM  through  theoretically -guided  in-depth  interviews. The  proposed  MyPEEPS  
intervention for YTM  is a novel  and evidence -driven intervention using mobile  technology  to deliver  
HIV prevention information to high-risk youth.  This will  be the  first study to develop and  pilot a 
scaled -up, mobile HIV  prevention  intervention designed  by, and piloted for,  a diverse group of  YTM.  
The final product  of this study will be the  basis for  an R01  application to conduct  a large - scale  
efficacy  study  for this population.  The proposed  MyPEEPS Mobile  intervention  for YTM  is a novel  
and evidence -driven intervention  using mobile technology to deliver HIV prevention information  
specifically developed  for YTM.  Consequently,  we are confident  that the proposed intervention  will 
be of high impact  intervention for  improving  HIV prevention behaviors in YTM  and have long -term 
implications for overall improvement  in the public’s  health.  
 
2.2 Theoretical  Framework  
 
Theoretical  Framework.  The Social -Personal  Framework  (Figure  1) was the theoretical  
framework  that guided  the two prior NIH-funded  MyPEEPS  studies.  The framework  has been  used  
broadly for  HIV prevention  in YMSM,  and young  women at  high-risk for  HIV and we  now propose  
to use an enhanced  model  for guiding  our development  of MyPEEPS  Mobile  for YTM.  We updated  
Figure  1. Social -Personal  Framework  of HIV and Substance  Use Risk the model  based  on our formativefocus  
groups  with YTM (described below  and 
highlighted  in yellow in  Figure  1). The  
barriers to sexual  health promotion  for 
YTM that are presented in the pilot  data 
below  are now included  (highlighted  in 
Figure 1)  in the theoretical framework for  
adapting  the MyPEEPS  intervention  for 
transmasculine  young  people. This 
framework  highlights the  role of  broader  
factors including:  psychological  well- 
being/emotional  regulation,  peer and  
partner relationships,  sexual  context

 minority  stress).  This model  guided the  development  of the content  for MyPEEPS Mobile. The  model  
provides clear direction for  HIV prevention programming related  to each of  these  constructs which are  
described in Table  3: developing  positive  peer norms,  encouraging  associations with  non-risk-taking  
peers and adults,  reducing psychological distress,  improving emotion regulation,  teaching assertive  
partner communication and safer sex behaviors  (e.g.,  condom  use), and developing a healthy personal  
identity.  
For example,  the current  MyPEEPS Mobile has content  related to sexual  minority stress and is  
presented  with 4 ways to manage stigma (see Table  3, activity 17).  In MyPEEPS Mobile for YTM, we  
will update  the content  to provide  information  on dealing  with stigma specific to YTM and  coping with  
victimization and violence.  Guided  by this framework,  we plan to update the  sexual  context  content  to 
specifically  focus on  discussions  of sexual consent,  which  was a noteworthy  issue amongst  the YTM in  
our focus group  sessions.  As a final example,  our current  MyPEEPS  
Mobile  has extensive information on substance use (see Table 3,  activity 7 “Goin’  Downhill  Fast).  For 
MyPEEPS  Mobile  for YTM, we  will include  additional  information  about the  interaction  between  
substance use and  gender affirming therapy.  Each activity will be reviewed,  and we will seek user - 
informed input  from a diverse group of  YTM  for adaptation as described in the  research plan for Aim  1 
below.  
 
3.1 STUDY  POPULATION  
 
3.2 Inclusion  Criteria  for All Aims  
 
3.2.1  To participate  in any aspect  of the study,  participants  must  be: 1) between  15 and 25 years  
of age; 2) female sex  assigned at  birth;  3) identify  as a transgender  man or  along the  transmasculine  
spectrum  (including a transmasculine non -binary gender;  e.g., male,  trans male,  transmasculine gender  
non-binary);  4) understand  and read English;  5) live within  the US;  6) own a smartphone;  7) self -report  
condomless receptive  anal or  vaginal penile  sex with either  a cisgender  male  or transgender  woman  
(e.g.,  individual  designated  or assigned  male  at birth)  in the past year;  and 8) self-report  HIV-negative  or 
unknown status.  Note:  Despite being uncommonly reported  in the  epidemiological  literature on sexual  
risk among TM,  and after careful  consideration,  we decided to include  having  had condomless receptive  
anal or vaginal  sex witha  transgender  woman  based on  the following  considerations:  (1) the anatomical  
mechanics of  receptive penile  intercourse being the  highest  risk sexual  act for HIV  transmission;  (2) the  
high HIV prevalence  among transgender  women,  making  that population  high risk sexual  partners; and  
(3) our focus  groups with  YTM reported  that penile sex with a transgender woman  was not  uncommon  
among the  proposed target  population.  The eligibility criteria  was expanded  to include  transmasculine  
gender nonbinary  individuals (1)  approximately 30%  of transgender  individuals  identify as  nonbinary or  
gender diverse(28), (2) at this age  youth  identify across  the spectrum  and are  fluid in  their identity (3)  
nonbinary individuals  experience  similar  barriers  to healthcare  and exclusion  from HIV prevention  
interventions.(29,  30). 
 
3.2.2  Inclusion  of Children  
Participants  will include  children  ages  15-17, thus children  will be well represented.  The investigative  team  has 
extensive  experience  conducting  research  with youth  in the proposed  age range.  Involvement  of children  in this 
study  will be in compliance  with all applicable  subparts  of 45 CFR Part 46 as well as other  pertinent  Federal  and 
State  laws/regulations.  This project  meets  standards  for inclusion  of children.  
 
3.3 Exclusion  Criteria  for All Aims  
Protocol  Number:  AAAT8624  
Version  1.5 
11/09 /2023  
21  
  
Participant  exclusion  criteria  for all  Aims. Youth are  ineligible  to participate  in the trial  if: 1) they are 
HIV positive;  2) they are  unable to provide informed  consent  due to severe  mental  or physical  illness  or 
substance intoxication  at the time of enrollment;  3) they are concurrently enrolled in another HIV  
prevention study. Note: Given that  (a) 72% of our current  same -age sample of  YMSM age 15 -18 
reported condomless anal  sex in the past  year and  (b) >800  YTM screened  ineligible in  our current  
protocol based on  birth-assigned  sex alone,  but reported considerable  behavioral risk,  we believe  that 
even with  this stringent  inclusion/exclusion  criteria we  will be able to successfully  recruit  our proposed  
sample in  the timeline  proposed.  Although  these criteria  may require  us to screen a larger number  of 
participants,  we will still be able  to reach  the recruitment  goals,  and this  is important for  assessing the  
feasibility of  this inclusion  criteria for a larger R01 trial.  
 
3.4 Recruitment  Procedures  
 
3.4.1  Recruitment  Targets  
 
To address all  study  aims,  we will recruit  a total of 105 participants.  For the heuristic evaluation,  we will 
recruit 5 informaticians.  For the usability testing,  RCT,  and in -depth  semi -structured interviews, we will  
recruit 100high -risk racially diverse YTM in the U.S. using community informed advertisements and  
messages  through  electronic  methods  (e.g.,  Twitch,  Cameo, TikTok,  Instagram, Twitter,  Facebook,  
Snapchat  partnering with YouTube and Instagram influencers) that  we have successfully used to recruit  
diverse YMSM across  several prior NIH -funded projects  using social  ecological frameworks.  We will use 
these electronic methods to target  high HIV  prevalence geographic contexts  (known as “hot  spots”)  and 
EHE jurisdictions.  Per the RFA,  we will  recruit  at least  50% of our study participants from  the EHE  
priority  jurisdictions.  Since 41% of  people acquiring HIV  annually in  the U.S.  live outside of  EHE priority  
jurisdictions and are  often understudied,  we will  recruit 50% of  our participants  from across the  broader  
U.S (non -EHE priority jurisdictions).  Additionally,  RFA-IA-21-018 calls for  research to include 50%  racial  
minorities,  which is integrated into our  recruitment  strategy (30% Black Non -Hispanic and 30% Latinx  (all 
races)  YTM).  Deliberately  including YTM of color is  critical , as it is estimated  that 50% of Black MSM  will 
acquire  HIV in their lifetimes compared to 1 in 11 White MSM.(31)  
 
3.4.2  Targeted Online National Campaign Led by the Study  Team  
 
In our own campaigns,  we will use  race- and age-specific as  well as population -based  advertising  
strategies,  including psychographic - and geo -targeting  (in-depth,  publicly available  consumer data  such  
as interests;  bulk upload  by region,  city, zip code,  or Designated Market  Areas (DMA))  to advertise  only 
to potentially eligible individuals.  an especially strong  following among YMSM. We will also consumer - 
centered  marketing  strategies advertise  through  Twitter,  Snapchat,  TikTok, Cameo,  Twitch  and partner  
with YouTube and Instagram influencers  to serve as ‘study ambassadors.’  We will also advertise through  
popular  dating sites (Grindr,  Scruff,  Grizzly,  Hornet, etc.)  to recruit  study participants who are 18+ years.  
We will target  our recruitment  advertising to YMSM of  color.(32) Sample  ads from our  past studies  which  
were developed  by our  staff with our community -based  participants  and have been  successfully used  to 
recruit Black  and Latino  YMSM are  in Table  1.

This ad  for the mLab  App trial 
features  two YMSM  sitting  
outside a coffee  shop having  
breakfast,  while one  is 
attending  to their dog,  the 
other one is taking a picture of  
their food for Instagram.  This 
ad affirms  the idea  that YMSM  
can in  be healthy,  happy  
relationships  partaking in  
activities  that in interest  them.  
Our study  staff develops  
relatable  LGBTQ  study  
advertisements so potential  
participants  can see 
themselves represented  and 
know  that this study  is looking  
to enroll  individuals like them.   
Our study staff  has developed  
creatives to represent  
Black/African  American YMSM  
and highlight the opportunityfor  
interested  volunteers  to 
participate in the mLab  App 
trial, which  has been widely  
advertised across  social  media  
platforms as a way to 
‘participate  in LGBTQ  
research.’  Over the years, our  
study  staff has learned that 
potential  participants  are very 
interested in giving back to the 
LGBTQ  community  and are 
looking for ways to activelyhelp  
in addressing  health issuesthat  
most  concern their  peers.  In developing  ads for social  
media campaigns,  we 
intentionally combine common  
interests  of YMSM  into one 
impactful  image to grab the  
attention  of recruits  for the 
mLab App trial.  The ad  below  
depicts a Latino YMSM bench  
pressing at  the gym,  whose  
phone received a notification  
about  a ‘match’  in an LGBTQ  
dating  app. Although  
advertising platforms  limit 
targeting to age, gender,  and 
geographic  location,  our ads 
showcase  real-world  behaviors  
that YMSM  are participating in  
to find eligible  men who are 
having sex  with men, that is, 
letting social  media  users know  
who we  are looking for.

3.4.3  Targeted Online National  Campaign Led  by Commando  LLC 
 
Additionally,  we will work with  our partner,  Commando LLC  to develop,  launch,  and execute  a national  
ad campaign.  Commando  has experience  with running successful advertising  campaigns  and will be  
working with  us to develop  social  media strategy  (including  creatives and  content  such as  In-Feed  
Videos, Reels, Facebook/Instagram Lives,  Stories),  providing  technical  support (landing  page  
assistance),  and analytics reporting (DMA  analysis that  provide powerful insights,  such as which  DMAs  
have higher  conversion rates,  engagement,  and return  on ads spends).  They  will be advertising  on top

 LGBTQ  dating  applications  (e.g.,  Grindr,  Growlr,  Adam4Adam, Scruff,  Jackd,)  with whom  they’ve  been  
very successful  in reaching YMSM for  other  studies.  
3.4.4  Recruitment  Limitations,  Anticipated  Problems  and Alternative  Solutions  Consistent  with 
multi -prong approaches  designed  to reduce  recruitment bias,  we will employ  the 
aforementioned  recruitment  methods. We will ward  off potential  recruitment problems by carefully  
monitoring each  approach to prevent  recruitment  problems.  This will involve weekly  review of  recruitment  
data with staff  to assess efforts and reports provided by  Commando LLC.  In this way,  the recruitment  
process will be  a dynamic  process  involving  actionable,  data-driven  insights  to help us improve  targeting,  
segmentation, and personalization  to improve the  recruitment  experience  for YTM.  
 
3.5 Screening  Procedures  
 
3.5.1  Eligibility  Screening  Procedures  
 
Potential  participants  will be electronically  screened  through  REDCap(33)  for eligibility  using  the full 
screening  instrument.  If a potential  participant  is screened  and eligible  and willing  to participate,  
then they  will voluntarily  provide  e-assent/consent.  If it is determined  during  enrollment  that a person is  
concurrently enrolled  in another  HIV prevention  study,  they will be deemed  ineligible.  
 
3.5.2  Verification of  Identity  and Initial Screening  Criteria  
 
We will use the following procedures to verify  the race,  sex, and age of  participants,  and ensure that  
participants are discrete,  not duplicated,  and to document the country of  residence,  for example,  
individuals living in the  U.S. or its territories):  1) Prior to signing  the electronic assent/consent  form for  
trial participation,  participants  are asked to do a confirmatory screening visit  via videoconferencing  
during their  baseline  phone call to confirm race,  sex, and age.  If participants become  ineligible,  we let 
them know that,  unfortunately,  we cannot  continue with  the visit  because eligibility has  changed;  2) To 
cross -check  age, participants  are asked  their date of birth;  3) Participants  are required  to show  any form 
of photo  ID during  the initial video  conference so we can  verify identity. If a participant  does not  have  a 
government  or school issued ID, we will  ask them to furnish a report  card/transcript  with their legal  
name,  age, and sex;  4) We will use 2 methods to verify  participants’  residence:  a) We will ask 
participants  to share  a form of ID which includes  an address,  and b)  we will cross -check the  address  on 
the ID with the IP address that  we collect  through REDCap  software.  If there  is a discrepancy,  we will  
review  with the study  participant  to better  understand if  there is a rationale (e.g.,  participant  is in 
college,).  Using procedures previously piloted,  we will  determine  co-enrollment.  
 
3.6 Informed  Assent  and Consent  
 
At the enrollment  visit we will collect  written informed  e-consent  (18 to 25 year  olds;  assent  for 15 to 17 
year olds) (see Appendix A) for study trial  participation,  which will  detail  purpose of  trial, study  
procedures, compensation for  contributed time, risks,  benefits, site contact information,  confidentiality  
and voluntary participation.  The consent  process  also details  the trial and  study compensation.  YMSM  
will then be  randomized to the intervention arm (MyPEEPS Mobile)  or control  (delayed intervention) arm.

21  
 4.1 STUDY  PROCEDURES  
 
4.2 Enrollment  Procedures  
 
When a participant  screens eligible,  a study team member  will schedule  a visit through  a 
videoconference call  using Zoom.  These procedures ensure the  integrity and success  of the study  
because:  1) We are able to eliminate  fraud  by verifying  participants’  identities  via videoconference,  fraud  
being a potential  problem  in online  research,(34,  35) and 2)  We establish  rapport  with our study  
participants  and have seen very  high retention rates related to this rapport  building between our  staff 
and study participants,  which will be augmented by electronic retention  strategies in this  study.  
 
4.3 Locator  Form/Contact  Information  
 
At enrollment,  participants will  be asked to provide contact  information  to contact  them  throughout  the 
duration of  study for  follow -up assessments. This information will  be captured  in REDCap  may be updated  
during follow -up assessment  and/or whenever  the participant  needs to update their  contact  information  on 
file. We will collect  each participant’s  cell phone  number,  email address,  as well as encourage  them to 
share  their social  media handles  (e.g., Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter  Facebook, WhatsApp, and/or  Skype  
usernames).  Participants will  be asked if  it is okay to mention  the name of  the project  and method(s)  of 
study  communication  preferred when receiving automated reminders (e.g.,  text messaging,  email,  phone  
call, leave  voicemail).  Study  staff will not send  messages or  leave voicemail messages unless  expressly  
permitted to do  so by the participant.  If permission is  given to leave  voice messages,  site staff  will assure  
participants that  messages left will  not include any  protected health information  or information related to 
study participation.  If permission is given to send text messages and/or if study staff is unable to get in 
contact through email, staff will send text messages using an IRB -approved messaging script to cont act 
participants throughout the duration of the study. Contact  information will  be maintained using the  same 
confidential  data management  practices used for all  study  data.  
 
4.4 Specific  Aim 1 Procedures.  
 
 
 
MyPEEPS  was built on considerable formative  work with multi -racial  and ethnic groups  
(R34MH079707; PI: Garofalo and U01MD011279;  MPIs: Schnall  and Garofalo). Findings from  the 
U01 have  been peer -reviewed  and published.(27,  36-40) In preparation  for this  R34,  we conducted  
extensive preliminary work to identify the common themes,  concerns,  and HIV risk  and protective  
factors  in YTM to expand  MyPEEPS and  ensure  its acceptability  for this group , particularly  for YTM  
who are  multi -racial  or come  from communities  of color . This will be done  using  the focus  group  data 
collected from 49 YTM  in our preliminary work  for this application,  and through the feedback  by our  
Expert  Review  Panel and usability  testing  with YTM . 
Expert  Review  Panel.  The goal of this panel  is to reach  censuses  on common  concerns,  risk, and 
protective  factors  for YTM.  
Procedures. The expert  and youth advisory panels  provided feedback remotely by  reviewing the  
curriculum and  providing written  comments.  Specific  Aim 1: Using  qualitative  methodology,  expert  feedback,  and usability  assessments,  
develop  MyPEEPS  Mobile  for YTM.

 Development  of mobile  delivery  technology. Following  the expert panel  sessions  and building  on our 
findings  from our  formative focus groups,  we will  develop mock -ups of a MyPEEPS Mobile App with  our

 partners  at One Cow  Standing,  a software development  company  (see Letter  of Support).  The mockup  
will have partial  functionality of  the system and enable us to test the design.  MyPEEPS  Mobile  for YTM  
will be novel,  innovative,  scientifically sound,  scalable,  translatable,  and likely to have a strong public  
health impact,  as detailed in  the Innovation section.  Dr. Radix will  oversee all  updates to the content  of 
the MyPEEPS  Mobile App, with  support from  MPIs  Drs. 
Schnall  and Garofalo.  The final  product  of this work will be a Beta version of the app for usability testing.  
Refinement  of the MyPEEPS  Mobile. Following  the development  of MyPEEPS  Mobile  for YTM,  we will 
conduct usability testing.  Usability  Testing.  The goal  of usability testing is to improve the design  and 
increase  the likelihood  of technology acceptance.  We will evaluate the user interface and system  
functions  of the MyPEEPS  Mobile App and  assess whether they are consistent  with the  end-users’  
needs. We will conduct  two types  of usability  assessments: A)  Heuristic Evaluation  and B) End-User  
Usability  Testing . 
 
Heuristic  Evaluation.  Sample: Five informaticians  with training  in human -computer interaction and who  
have  published  in the field of informatics  will be recruited  as usability  experts.  Nielsen  recommends  using  
three to five evaluators  since one  gains little  additional  information  by using  larger numbers(41).  We will 
recruit them through  direct  contact  with the  Informatics Departments at  Columbia University and Weill  
Cornell  Medical  College,  both of which have  a large cadre of  informatics  researchers.  Dr. Schnall will  
send  a message  to potential  evaluators  via email  using  the MyPEEPS  Heuristic  Email  Recruitment  Script.  
Procedures:  The heuristic  evaluator  will be consented  using  the Heuristic  Evaluation  Consent  form.  Once  
consented,the  heuristic evaluators will  assess a web-based  Beta version of the MyPEEPS Mobile  App 
remotely via Zoom software.  Evaluator screen movements  and audio will  be recorded via Zoom.  
Identifiable  characteristics,  such  as facial  features  and names,  will not be recorded.  Similar  to procedures  
that we have  used  in ourprior  work(42 -44), each  evaluator will be asked  to evaluate the  system using  
the Heuristic Evaluation Checklist  and to think -aloud while performing the usability  testing(45).  
Participants will be asked  to say aloud what  they are  thinking,  seeing,  and trying to do while  they are 
performing  the tasks  required for  the scenarios.  When a user finds  errors  or the researchers find  critical  
incidents that  are characterized by  comments,  silence,  or looks  of puzzlement,  the researcher  will record  
the users’  activities.  
Recording the users’ interactions and  vocalizations provides  additional  feedback  that can highlight  
problems that  would not  be identified  with static screen shots(46).  Each  evaluator will  walk through the  
use case scenarios (see “MyPEEPS  Heuristic UseCaseScenarios  Procedure 11.16”) and  a study  team  
member will  navigate  through the app  per evaluator instructions  to complete the  assigned tasks.  Once  
the walkthrough is complete,  the evaluator will  fill out the Qualtrics survey titled,  “Heuristic Evaluation  
Survey.”  After  the heuristic  evaluation,  participants  will be asked  to rate the prototype’s  perceived  ease  of 
use and perceived potential  usefulness using  a standardized instrument. Instrument:  Nielsen(47)  
proposed a list of ten recommended  heuristics for a usable interface design.  Each heuristic  will be 
evaluated  by one or more items,  and the  overall  severity  of the identified  heuristic violations  will be 
rated.(48)  Evaluators  will also complete  the Health  Information  Technology  (IT) Usability Evaluation  
Scale  (Health -ITUES)  to rate usability.  This tool varies  from most  traditional  measurement  scales  in that it 
is designed  to support  customization  at the item level to match  the specific  task/expectation  and health  IT 
system  while retaining standardization at  the construct  level. The Health -ITUES supports evaluation  of 
three  levels  of task/expectation:  user-system,  user-system -task,  and user-system - taskenvironment.  
Schnall  (MPI) has published on  the usefulness of  the Health -ITUES for  evaluating the usability  of mHealth  
technology(53).  Data  Analysis:  The frequencies  of usability issues  will be calculated according  to the 
heuristic principles adapted from  Nielsen’s checklist.  
Mean severity scores will  be calculated  for each heuristic  principle.  Evaluators’  comments  about  usability

 problems on  the evaluation  form and the  recording  will be grouped  and content  analyzed  according  to 
the usability factors of  Nielsen’s  heuristics.(49) Recordings  will be kept until data analysis is  complete  
and findings  have  been  disseminated.  Heuristic  evaluators  will be compensated  a $150  Amazon  gift code  
for their  time and will  receive  the gift  code  via email  using  the Heuristic  Evaluator / Usability  
Compensation  Email  Template.  
Usability  Testing  with YTM.  We will conduct usability  testing  with YTM  to identify  violations  of 
usability principles and  any potential obstacles  to their effective use and content  of intervention  
adaptation of MyPEEPS  Mobile  with members  of our  advisory board  of transmasculine  youth.  
This is an  iterative process  that involves  testing the  system and  then using the  results to change  
it to better  meet  users' needs.  Sample:  We will recruit  20 YTM (15-25 years  old) who will  
participate  remotely in  the formative  evaluation of the prototype  user interface  screens. The 
rationale for 20 participants  is based on past  usability  research,  which has indicated  that 95% of  
usability problems  can be identified  with 20 users(50).  These  youth  will serve  as community  
voices,  specifically  youth  as advisors.  We will purposely  sample  our usability  testing  participants  
to ensure  diversity  regarding  race,  ethnicity,  and age. We will be recruiting by reaching  out to 
participants  in our REDCap  database who  previously  expressed interest  in the  study  or 
participants  who are  enrolled in another  one of  our studies.  When  we reach out  to these  
participants in  REDCap, we  will be using  the MyPEEPS Participant Outreach  Script.  We will also 
be using flyers for  recruitment,  once approved by the IRB.  Participants will  be screened for  
eligibility using the  Usability  Screener  in REDCap.  Procedures:  We are reques ting a waiver  of  
documenta tion of conse nt for online  screening procedures . The screening  information will only  be kept 
electronically in  REDCap,  which  is a secure, CUMC  approved  system. If participants  screen  eligibl e,  
study  staff will go through  the informed  consent  process with participants. If  participants  consent   
to participate,  they will complete  the Assent/Consent form  for Usability Testing. Participants  will 
complete a brief demographic background  and computer usage  survey.  
Participants will use a web-based beta version of  the MyPEEPS Mobile  with screen movements and 
audio recorded via Zoom software.  Identifiable characteristics,  such as facial  features and names,  will 
not be recorded.  After  the usability  evaluation,  participants will  be asked to rate the prototype’s  
perceived  ease of use and perceived potential usefulness using a standardized instrument. Instrument:  
We will measure self -reported  ease of  use and usability  with the Health Information  Technology (IT)  
Usability  Evaluation Scale (Health -ITUES)(51,  52). Data  Analy sis: The analysis  will be based on the  
recordings of  user sessions,  transcriptions,  notes,  and the  user surveys,  and mean task  performance  
time will  be calculated.  Dr. Schnall will search  for critical incidents which  will be characterized  by 
comments,  silence,  and repetitive actions.  Dr. Schnall  will review  these  incidents in detail using Zoom  
software.  The incidents will be identified,  and the  users’  written comments summarized. Content  
analysis,  a technique  for making replicative  and valid inferences  from data,  will be performed by  the 
research assistant  under  Schnall’s  supervision.  The comments will be categorized  according to the 
positive  characteristics,  negative  characteristics,  and recommendations  made  by the end- users.  Results  
from the standardized surveys will  be analyzed  using SAS 9.4  (SAS Institute,  Cary NC)  to calculate  the 
descriptive statistics to complement  the findings from  the usability assessment.  Using the findings  from 
these  activities,  we will  refine MyPEEPS  for use in Aim 2.  Recordings will  be kept  until data analysis is 
complete and findings  have  been  disseminated.  Participants  will be compensated  for their time  in the  
form of  a $40 Amazon  gift code  and will receive the  gift code  via email using the  Heuristic Evaluator  / 
Usability  Compensation  Email  Template.

Overview.  We will conduct  a 6-month  randomized controlled  pilot study  with 80 YTM. The goals  of the 
pilot study are to:  a) Gain direct  feedback from participants  about  whether and to what  degree the  
MyPEEPS  Mobile  App worked as  intended; b) Assess  the acceptability  of MyPEEPS  Mobile dosing  and 
content for  YTM;  and c) Observe  the flow of procedures,  including assessment  at baseline,  retention  
efforts,  data management,  and follow -up assessments.  The recruitment  plan,  screening,  and 
consent/assent processes are described in  the Protection of  Human Subjects and Clinical  Trials  
Information  sections.  Our primary  outcome for  this study  will be: change  in number  of condomless  
receptive  anal or vaginal  sex acts with  sex partners  assigned  male at birth . Sampling Approach  to 
Successfully  Enroll YTM  in this Project.  We will recruit  80 participants  from an  online  national  sample  
and ensure  that at least half of our sample  is from racial/ethnic  minority  groups.  Using  active  and passive  
recruitment  methods,  the on -site project  coordinators will  oversee and participate in recruitment  efforts.  
The study staff  hired for this project,  on-site coordinator,  and the peer -to-peer networking  efforts will be  
used to recruit  study participants.  Our pilot study will comprise a convenience  sample through active  
online  recruitment  through  Instagram,  Twitter,  Snapchat, and Facebook  advertisements.  We will use 
psychographic targeting (in -depth,  publicly  available consumer data such as interests,  city) to advertise  
only to potentially  eligible individuals.  We have  successfully used  this approach to recruit  our sample of  
YMSM  in the MyPEEPS project.  Through our advertisements, and  as previously mentioned,  we have  
screened  
>800  YTM who would  be eligible for the proposed MyPEEPS study,  and we will plan to recruit them  as 
well as others into the proposed study.  We are confident  in our ability  to enroll  the proposed  target  
sample . 
Sample  Size and Power  Calculation. This study  plan is to enroll  80 participants  with 1:1 random  
assignment  to the intervention arm  and the control  arm (i.e.,  40 in each  arm).  Compared  to a large - 
scale randomized trial,  we do not expect  that this pilot trial will have  power to detect  many  of the  
 
effects  that would  be of scientific  or have  policy  significance.  This is consistent  with the aims  of this 
pilot grant  mechanism,  where budgetary limitations necessitate small  sample  sizes.  Group means  
on continuous  variables typically  begin  to stabilize  by 20 -30 subjects.  Thus,  a sample size  of 40 
participants  per group  should  provide  relatively  stable  group  means  for the intervention  and control  
conditions, even with some sample  attrition.  
Potential  Problems/Alternative  Solutions  Regarding  Recruitment.  Consistent  with the multi - 
prong recruitment  approach designed  to reduce  recruitment  bias(54,  55), our team will carefully  
monitor each  approach to prevent  recruitment  problems.  This will involve  weekly review of  
recruitment  data with staff to assess  efforts.  In this way, recruitment  will be a dynamic  process  and 
will reach the proposed diverse group of  YTM.  
Eligibility  Screening  and Informed  Assent/Consent.  See Protection  of Human  Subjects.   
Study  Enrollment.  A baseline visit  will be conducted involving a behavioral  assessment  and will  
last approximately 1.5 -2 hours.  YTM will  then be randomized to the intervention or  delayed  
intervention arm.  An enrollment  project  will be created in REDCap  to collect  and manage  data for  
enrolled  participants.  The longitudinal study module,  automatic survey invitations,  and secure file  
upload capabilities  can be used  in conjunction  with customizable  reports  to ensure  streamlined  
operations  and efficient  data management.  Eligible volunteers  will be scheduled for a one-time Specific  Aim 2: Conduct  a pilot randomized  controlled  trial to examine the feasibility,  
acceptability,  and preliminary  efficacy  of the MyPEEPS  Mobile  App for YTM  in a sample  of 80 
YTM  (15-25 years)  and refine  the study  methods  for a future  efficacy  trial.

 face-to-face video call  (e.g.,  Zoom),  with a study team  member to enroll.  The enrollment  visit is 
conducted via video  to validate  identification  and age (view identification documents)  and build  
rapport to support  retention over time.  Study  staff will create a record  for the volunteer,  and 
REDCap will send the  volunteer a customized interview assessment  via e-mail beginning  with the  
consent/assent  process with electronic signature  capability.  The longitudinal  module  of REDCap  
will automate follow -up data collection  by generating  a unique study  visit schedule  for every  
participant, anchored to their enrollment date.  Paired with automated  survey invitations,  
participants  will be automatically invited  via e -mail to complete follow -up surveys based  on their  
unique study visit  schedule.  These invitations  include up  to 5 automated  reminders sent  in pre- 
defined  intervals.  Staff monitor  the completion of  follow -up survey data at  3 and 6 months,  which  
include the  primary  and secondary  outcome assessments,  via the  reports,  which  query  the 
completion status  in real time.

BottomLine  
Overview  User is  presented with  chronology of  how 
their BottomLine  changed  
throughout  the app and  encouraged  to 
continue to stick to their goals  for sexual  
safety.  Summary  
Randomization  to Intervention  and Control  (Delayed  Intervention)  Arms.  Using  the 
randomization module  in REDCap  and the  approach described  below,  there will be  
random  or minimally  biased assignment  of subjects  to study  arms. We will use block 
randomization  with randomly permutated blocks(56) to reduce opportunities for  
selection bias.  The advantage  of the permutated  block design is that  treatment  
assignment  is pre-determined  before the trial begins and then  assignment  remains 
static  throughout  the course  of the trial(57).  Blinding and  random assignment  will be 
maintained through continuous  supervision  by key members of  the research team.  All 
staff and participants  will be kept  blinded to outcome measurements during data  
collection(58).  This technique  will maintain complete  randomness of  the assignment  of 
a subject  to a group.  Participants  will be randomized  based on the use of  a password 
protected computer - generated random numbers at  baseline to avoid  the possibility of  
study staff  subverting  randomization as has  been noted  in previous studies(59).  
Following completion  of the informed assent/consent  and baseline  assessment,  
participants will be randomly assigned  to one of the two  trial arms using  the 
randomization module  in REDCap(57).  This willminimize the biased assignment  of 
study  subjects(60).  
Intervention  Delivery.  If the study  participant  is randomized  to the intervention  arm, they will have  
access  to the MyPEEPS  Mobile  App for the  next three months. Participants randomized  to the 
control  (delayed intervention) arm  will be given access to MyPEEPS Mobile at  the 3 -month study  
visit. Through our dashboard,  we can monitor when participants  login to MyPEEPS Mobile,  time 
spent  on each  activity,  and whether  they are actively  using  the intervention  or just logged  in. 
Participants  will have  3 months  to complete  the 4 MyPEEPS  Mobile  modules,  which  includes  25 
embedded mobile  activities (See  Table  3). 
Participants  in the intervention  group will  be able to access  the MyPEEPS  intervention from  
baseline until the end  of month  3 and the control  arm (delayed intervention)  will have  access  to the 
MyPEEPS  App from months  4-6 (see Figure  2). Overview of  data collection  time points.  We  
will conduct  simultaneous assessments for  both study  arms at  baseline,  3 months,  and 6 months . 
The delayed  intervention  design is essentially  a 
cross -over design  in which  data are collected  in 
parallel  from both study  arms through the  primary  
endpoint  - 3-months  post-randomization  (Figure  2). 
The arms  are then crossed over, which  has multiple  
benefits,  including:  1) for ethical reasons per  our 
Figure  2. Assessment  Time  Points  and Intervention  Delivery  for 
Each  Study Arm  experience  with HIV prevention  interventions  with 
transgender  populations,  the delayed  intervention  
group receives the potential  benefit  of the

 intervention  at the point  of cross -over;  2) at the 6-month  follow -up, it provides for a test of the 
durability  of the intervention  effect  in the  intervention group  (i.e., 3 -months post -intervention, pre - 
post);  3) it provides an additional  secondary test  of the intervention  effect  in the delayed  
intervention  arm (pre-post);  and 4) it provides  additional  time points  (and power)  in the intervention  
group  to test moderators  of the trajectory  of sexual  risk over time.  We successfully  used  this study  
design in an NIH-funded R34  study (61). 
MyPEEPS  avatars  represent  “regular  guys”  like the study  participants  who will walk the participants  
through the curriculum.  Following the selection of  an avatar,  the study participant  will navigate  
through each of  the study  activities.  Participants do not  need to complete an  activity in a single  
sitting but  can stop and come  back to complete  the activities at  any time during  the time  frame  
before the  3-month  follow -up. Study staff will  have access  to a dashboard to monitor  module  
completion.  In addition,  participants will  receive  weekly text  messages and/or e -mails  (participants  
will select) to remind them to complete the  MyPEEPS module.  If 2 weeks have passed and a 
participant  has not  completed any  modules,  then the app will send out  notification reminders  to 
remind them to complete their  modules.  
 
4.6 Specific  Aim 3 Procedures.  
 
Overview.  Post-intervention,  we will conduct  individual,  in-depth,  semi -structured  interviews  with 
participants who completed  the intervention.  
Sample.  We will purposively  select  participants  to represent  a diverse  set of experiences  (e.g.,  
participants  who completed  App Use, high vs. low sexual  activity).  Although  we will continue  to 
recruit  participants until  reaching thematic saturation,  we anticipate  conducting  about  20 
interviews  
Procedures.  The in-depth  interviews  will be 45-60 minutes  in length.  Following  completion  of the 
informed consent  process,  all interviews  will be audio -recorded.  The interview  guide will  be 
informed  by the predisposing, reinforcing, and Enabling  Constructs  in Evaluation  (PRECEDE)  
portion  of the  PRECEDE -PROCEED  Model of health  program planning  and evaluation(62).  In 
addition to the evaluation  of public  health programs, this framework has been  applied to the 
evaluation  of health  information  technology  and has been  proposed  by several  authors  as a 
strategy  for assessing predisposing,  enabling,  and 
reinforcing factors  for use and acceptance of  health  
information  technology  tools(63 -65). Structured  
interview  questions are  listed in  Table 4 .

27  
 Ensuring Rigor.  The team will adhere to qualitative  research processes  to ensure the  credibility,  
confirmability, dependability,  and transferability of  the qualitative data  from these analyses.(66)  
To support  the credibility of  the data,  we will  conduct peer debriefing  and triangulate findings  
across multiple  data sources  (surveys,  interview data).  In addition,  we will use “member  checks,”  
i.e., sharing  of initial  data interpretations  with participants  to ensure  accurate  interpretations.  
Triangulation  of findings, along with  reflexivity,  will enhance  the confirmability  of the 
interpretations.  The investigators will carefully record an  audit  trail and keep extensive field  notes  
to facilitate  transferability of study  findings into  other  contexts.  Table  
Data Analysis.  All in-depth interviews will  be transcribed verbatim and  then coded.  Recordings  
will be kept  until data  analysis is  complete  and findings  have been  disseminated.  The 
development  and application  of a coding  scheme is  an integral  component  of the data  analysis  
process. It enables the systematic  examination and interpretation of the data  related to the primary  
analytic  foci. The coding  scheme  is conceptualized  as a multilevel  structure.  At the highest  level are 
the primary analytic foci  coded as  headings.  Specific  aspects or  dimensions of the headings  are 
assigned  core codes.  Specific  aspects  or dimensions  of the core codes  are assigned  sub-codes.  
We will use NVivo ™ (QSR  International, Victoria,  Australia), a software  program  for qualitative  
analysis,  to facilitate  the analysis.  The following  7 steps  will be used  to develop  the coding  scheme:  
Step 1: Identify the  principal  issues discussed  by participants;  Step 2: Construct  definitions  of the 
primary analytic themes;  Step 3: Develop and apply core  codes and sub -codes to the initial  set of 
interviews; Step 4: Develop a provisional  coding  scheme;  Step 5: Test and refine  the provisional  
coding scheme;  Step 6: Reconcile coding differences and  construct  an updated and  final coding  
scheme;  Step 7: Apply  the coding  scheme  to the full data set and assess  inter-coder  reliability.  
After all transcripts have  been coded,  we will extract  and examine  the content  of text segments  
linked to core codes and sub - codes relevant  to understanding barriers and facilitators to the  use of  
the MyPEEPS App.  Based on the coded data,  we will  propose ways in which certain themes are 
analytically  related. A careful  examination of  the coded text  will reveal  the associations among  
these themes and may  lead to more  refined data searches.  Once we establish patterns of  
relationships  among  themes  and issues,  we will identify  participants’  accounts  that support  or refute  
these  patterns.  Identifying and accounting  for cases that  deviate from  an interpretative pattern  
enables us to test and confirm the pattern’s validity and  robustness.  
Triangulation  of Findings.  We will examine  changes  in HIV risk behaviors  and its relationship  to 
factors  including but  not limited to changes in substance use,  alcohol  use, stigma,  victimization.  
We will triangulate  the findings  from our quantitative  outcome  measures  (Aim 2) with the findings  
from our  qualitative data (Aim  3) to better understand participants’ decisions for their  HIV risk 
behaviors.  
Anticipated  Problems  and Alternative  Study  Design  Considerations.  The study  team  thought  
very carefully about  alternative  design considerations.  (1) We carefully  considered a more  
traditional  RCT design  and control  group.  However,  in prior HIV prevention  interventions  projects  
targeting transgender populations  we received considerable negative pushback  from the 
community  regarding this  approach(67).  (2) We carefully considered less  stringent  sexual  risk 
inclusion criteria,  but firmly  believe that  we can recruit  the proposed  sample  using condomless  
sex as our outcome  variable.  (3) If needed  for recruitment  to maximize  participants who  report  
condomless sex,  we can expand  the age range to 25 years based  on age range of  the original  
MyPEEPS  trial. 
Summary.  The final product  of this study  will be the basis  for an R01 application  to conduct  a 
large -scale  efficacy  study  for this population.  The proposed  MyPEEPS  Mobile  intervention  for 
YTM is a novel  and evidence -driven intervention using  mobile technology to deliver  HIV 
Protocol  Number:  AAAT8624  
Version  1.5 
11/09 /2023   
 prevention information specifically developed  for YTM.  Consequently, we are confident that  
proposed intervention  will be of  high impact  intervention  for improving  HIV prevention behaviors  
in YTM and  have long -term implications for overall  improvement  in the public’s health.  
 
5.1 DATA  COLLECTION  AND  SITE  MONITORING  
 
5.2 Development  of Protocol  and Case  Report  Forms  
 
The Protocol  Team  in collaboration  is responsible  for the development  of this protocol  as well as 
the Case Report  Forms  (CRFs)  needed to collect  the information required to implement  this 
protocol.  
 
5.3 Data  Records  
 
Participant -related  study information will  be identified through  a Participant  ID (PID)  on all  
participant  CRF and Computer  Assisted  Self Interviewing  (CASI)  files. Participant  names  or other  
personally -identifying information will  not be used  on any  study documents  and will be  redacted  
from interview  transcripts.  Participant names and their  PID will be stored separately  from other  
study information in REDCap or secure University servers, accessible only to designated  study  
staff, site  monitors,  and representatives from  the NIH. PIDs will not be entered into  the 
MyPEEPS Mobile app;  instead,  a unique  username will  be assigned to each  participant  when  
they create  an account  for the MyPEEPS Mobile app.  These unique  usernames will  be provided  
by the study team.  Original  source  documents for  individual  participants will be maintained at  
the respective study site  and will  be accessible only to the study staff.  Data  from original  source  
documents will be transcribed  on CRFs  as applicable.  
 
5.4 Data  Collection  
 
 
5.4.1  CASI  Data  
 
Data  collected  using  a web-based  CASI  method  will be on a portable  computer,  tablet,  or mobile  
phone (what  the participant  chooses)  via an internet -based  application.  All survey data will  be 
collected using REDCap.  Data will remain confidential.  The participant’s  unique PID  # will be  
used in  order to link the  responses to the participant.  
 
5.4.2  Zoom  Platform  Description  
 
Zoom will be used to schedule videoconference  with participants  remotely for  screening  and 
enrollment  procedures.  Zoom  is compatible  on PCs,  tablets,  and smartphones;  as well as 
maintains the  option to conduct  an audio conference  without  the video component.  Zoom  is 
responsible  for keeping all  patient  information  secure and report  any breaches of  protected  
health  information  (PHI).  
 
End-to-end encryption . Zoom  encrypts  all presentation  content  at the application  layer  using  the 
Advanced  Encryption  Standard  (AES)  256-bit algorithm.  Zoom  end-to-end (E2E)  chat encryption  
28 
Protocol  Number:  AAAT8624  
Version  1.5 
11/09 /2023   
 allows for  a secured  communication where  only the  intended recipient  can read  the secured  
message.  Zoom  uses public  and private  keys to encrypt  the chat session  with Advance  
Encryption  Standard (AES256),  and session keys are generated with device  unique hardware ID 
to avoid  data being read  from other  devices.  This ensures  that the session  cannot  be 
eavesdropped  or tampered with.  
 
Cloud  Control  Infrastructure . A distributed  network of  low-latency  multimedia routers  (software)  
resides  on Zoom’s  communications  infrastructure.  With these  low-latency  multimedia  routers,  all 
session data  originating from the  host’s  device  and arriving  at the participants’ devices is  
dynamically switched — never stored  persistently through the Zoom  communications  
infrastructure.  Zoom’s  communications  infrastructure  for real-time video,  audio,  and data 
communications  resides on  Zoom  dedicated servers,  which  are housed in  SSAE 16 SOC2  
compliant  datacenters  on opposite sides of  the US. Zoom sessions are completely temporary  
and operate analogously  to the popular mobile  conversation over the  public mobile  network.  In 
addition to unique security  benefits,  Zoom’s  communications infrastructure  also enables  an 
extremely scalable and  highly available meeting infrastructure unrestricted by the limitations of  
physical  data centers.  
 
The Zoom client  communicates with  the multimedia  router  to establish  a reliable  and secure  
connection.  At the time of instantiation,  the Zoom client  will determine the best  method for  
communication,  attempting  to connect  automatically  using  udp and tcp port 8801,  8802  and 8804  
or HTTPS  (port 443/TLS).  
 
5.4 Data  Submission  
 
 
5.4.1  CASI  Data  Transmission  
 
Only authorized users  will be able to access and  open the survey  through REDCap.  To ensure  
data privacy,  as soon as  data is  entered  (in real -time),  it will be  encrypted during  transmission  to 
REDCap.  The data will routinely be  downloaded  and stored  in a secure  database  on University  
servers.  
 
5.4.2  Retention  Data  
 
The study  will use a Health  Insurance  Portability  and Accountability  Act (HIPAA) -compliant  web- 
based platform entitled REDCap,  which aids  studies with  various aspects of  participant  
recruitment,  study implementation,  and retention.  The application has the ability to securely  
manage  participant  information  across  multiple  studies  and customers  simultaneously,  stratifying  
participant  information  by study  and site. REDCap  provides  study  staff the ability  to conduct  data 
entry for  longitudinal participant  tracking  from screening  to study completion  and to use secure  
messaging,  study  calendar  management,  secure  photo  uploads.  The ability  to designate  specific  
roles with  certain levels  of access to every  REDCap user  allows  for greater  control  around  
permissions  and accessibility  to participant  information.  Users  can even  be limited  to a reporting  
only role,  which allows  for study oversight  through real  time aggregate reporting,  but no access  
to PHI.

5.5 Data  Quality  Control  and Quality  Assurance  
 
Investigators  receiving  federal  funding  must  adhere  to the Code  of Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  to 
protect  research participants and  produce reliable study  information.  The study  coordinators will  
monitor  data entry  and will have  an internal  quality  assurance  plan that will identify  problems  and 
correct  errors  in research  study  records.  
 
5.6 Study  Site Monitoring  and Record  Availability  
 
Site monitors  under  contract  to the National  Institute  of Allergy  and Infectious  Diseases  (NIAID)  will 
visit participating  clinical  research  sites to review  participants  records,  including  consent  forms,  
CRFs,  medical  records  (e.g.,  physicians’  progress  notes,  nurses’  notes,  individuals’  hospital  charts),  
and laboratory  records  to ensure  protection  of study  participants,  compliance  with the IRB approved  
protocol/amendments,  and accuracy  and completeness  of records.  The monitors  will inspect  sites’  
regulatory  files to ensure  that local regulatory  requirements,  in addition  to U.S. Federal  regulations,  
are being  followed.   They  will also inspect   sites’  pharmacies  to review  product  storage  and 
management.  
 
6.1 PARTICIPANT  TRACKING  & CLINICAL  MANAGEMNT  
 
6.2 Retention  Efforts  
 
Study staff  will track retention,  which will  be reviewed weekly  by the PIs.  As has  been successful  
in previous  studies with this  population,  including the MyPEEPS  Mobile efficacy trial,  we will: 1) 
obtain,  at baseline,  participants’  email addresses,  phone  numbers,  social media handles,  as well 
as the addresses  and contact  information  of people  participants  believe  could  help us locate  them  
in the future;  2) allow  for any time  of day, and all days of the week, for participants to complete  
online assessment  visits;  3) provide participants  with numerous  methods for  contacting  study  
staff,  including  providing study  phone numbers,  email  addresses,  and social media handles  and 
if agreed to by the participant,  having them  program our  site numbers into their mobile phone  
during the enrollment  visit; 4) routinely  verify participants’  locator information at  every contact  
point;  5) if correspondence  is returned indicating  a participant  no longer  has a given  email  
address,  study staff will telephone  to obtain  their new email  address;  6) if the phone  number  is 
disconnected,  we will contact  them  via their social media  accounts  and/or individuals  listed  in 
participants’  records ; and 7) if participants are not responsive after 5 email correspondence 
attempts and /or have given permission to message them via phone number, we will attempt to 
make contact using participants’ phone numbers using IRB -approved scripts . We will make every  
effort  to maintain contact  with participants, even if they move  or discontinue  the intervention,  for 
those  still willing  to complete  follow -up assessment  visits.  Given the older study  population 
proposed in this trial,  we are confident  we will retain at  least 80% of the study  population for this 
study  proposed in this  trial, we are confident  we will retain  at least  80% of the study  population  
for this study.  
 
6.3 Intervening  on “Social  Harm”  
 
All sites have  specific policies governing  the treatment  of human participants.  These policies  
Protocol  Number:  AAAT8624  
Version  1.5 
11/09 /2023  
31  
 specify that  medical  and psychological  assistance will  be available  in the immediate  environment  
in the  event  a participant  should  experience  any adverse  reactions resulting  from study 
Protocol  Number:  AAAT8624  
Version  1.5 
11/09 /2023  
32  
 procedures.  
 
While participants will  be informed that  they may refuse  to answer  any question at  any time,  
responses  or reactions  to certain  questions  may indicate  distress  on the part of the participants.  If 
at any time during the  study, a participant  divulges  that he is  at risk for harm, including but  not 
limited to being abused  or experiencing  violence,  if harm  is suspected  or likely,  or if the  
participant  states  he is  suicidal/homicidal,  measures  will be taken  to ensure  his or her safety. 
Reporting  will be done as appropriate  to the situation and the  legal  statutes,  including reporting  
to child protection agencies or  other appropriate agencies and  referrals will  be provided  to 
appropriate  support,  counseling,  or treatment  resources.  
 
 
6.4 Criteria  for Permanent  Intervention  Discontinuation  for an Individual  Participant  
 
The criteria for permanent  discontinuation of  further study  intervention for an  individual  
participant  are: 
• Study  product/intervention -related  adverse  event  
• Reaching a defined  clinical  endpoint  
• Completion of  study intervention as defined in  the protocol  
• Request  by participant  to terminate study  intervention  
• Clinical  conditions,  which  in the best judgment  of the investigator  are believed  to be harmful  
or potentially  life-threatening  to the participant,  even  if not addressed  in the AE Management  
section  of the  protocol  
 
Participants may end  their participation  in the study at any time.  No further  data collection will  
occur  from the date the decision  is made  to permanently  discontinue  the subject  from the study.  
Participants who experience  distress during  the survey  can access our  list of community  
referrals,  which can be  viewed  on our study's  website,  or contact  the research staff  using  the 
information  provided to the participant  within  the consent/assent  process.  Any unexpected  
adverse events will  be immediately reported to the Columbia University IRB,  if applicable.  All 
study activities  will halt pending  Columbia University  IRB review and  recommendations  if 
necessary.  If a participant  withdraws  or is removed from the  study,  the site study  coordinator  
will complete the  necessary documentation regarding  the participants off  study  status.  
 
 
6.5 Criteria  for Premature  Study  Discontinuation  for an Individual  Participant  
 
The criteria for premature  discontinuation from the study  for an individual participant  are: 
• Lost to follow up as evidenced  by failure by  the participant  to attend  specified  
consecutive  clinic visits, at  the discretion  of the site investigator;  
• Participant  repeatedly  non-compliant  with study intervention as  prescribed;  
• Request  by participant  to withdraw  assent/consent;  
• The study  is cancelled  by the  NIH; 
• The study is cancelled  for other  administrative  reasons;  
Protocol  Number:  AAAT8624  
Version  1.5 
11/09 /2023  
33  
 • The participant  becomes incarcerated or  placed in detention during thestudy;  
• The participant  reports an HIV positive  diagnoses;  
• Participant  judged  by the investigator  to be at significant  risk of failing  to comply  with the 
provisions  of the protocol  as to cause  harm  to self or seriously  interfere  with the validity  of 
study  results;  or 
• Death  of the  participant  
 
7.1 DATA  MANGEMENT,  SECURITY  & ANALYSIS  
 
7.2 Power  Considerations  and Sample  Size Calculation  (Aim2)  
 
Sample  Size and Power  Calculation. The study  plan is to enroll  80 participants  with 1:1 random  
assignment  to the intervention arm  and the control  arm (i.e.,  40 in each arm).  Compared to a 
large - scale  randomized trial,  we do  not expect  that this pilot  trial will have power  to detect  many  
of the effects that  would be of  scientific or  policy significance.  This is consistent  with the aims  of 
this pilot grant  mechanism,  where  budgetary limitations necessitate small sample sizes.  Group  
means on  continuous  variables typically  begin  to stabilize  by 20-30 participants.  Thus,  a sample  
size of  40 participants per group  should provide  relatively stable group  means  for the intervention  
and control  conditions,  even with  some sample attrition.  
 
Study  Design. Participants  in the intervention  group  will be able  to access  the MyPEEPS  
intervention  from baseline  until the end of month  3, and the control  arm (delayed  intervention)  
will have  access to the MyPEEPS App  from months  4-6. 
 
Overview  of Data  Collection  Time  Points.  We will conduct simultaneous  assessments  for both 
study arms  at baseline,  3 months,  and 6 months.  We will also collect  an immediate post - 
intervention assessment  for the delayed intervention arm. The delayed intervention design  is 
essentially a cross -over design  in which  data are collected  in parallel from  both study  arms  
through the primary  endpoint  - 3 months  post-randomization.  The arms  are then  crossed over,  
which  has multiple benefits,  including:  1) for ethical reasons per  our experience  with transgender  
populations, the delayed intervention group receives the potential  benefit  of the intervention at  
the point  of cross -over;  2) at the 6 -month follow -up, it provides  for a test of the durability  of the 
intervention  effect  in the intervention  group (i.e., 3 months  post-intervention,  pre-post);  3) it 
provides an additional  secondary test  of the intervention effect  in the delayed  intervention arm  
(pre-post);  and 
4) it provides  additional  time points  (and power)  in the intervention  group,  to test moderators  of 
the trajectory of  sexual  risk over  time.  
 
7.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
 
7.3.1  Training  on Human  Subjects and  Data  Safety  and Monitoring.  
 
All proposed staff  have participated in the NIH  required trainings for conduct  of studies that  
involve human subjects and any  future study  staff will do so upon  hiring.  Training  for all staff  
Protocol  Number:  AAAT8624  
Version  1.5 
11/09/2023   
 includes  (but is not limited to) Protection of Human Subjects,  Informed Consent,  Good Clinical  
Practice, Quality  Management, Confidentiality,  and Reporting  of Adverse  Events, REDCap data  
entry  and management.  If any study staff  discovers any untreated  condition (e.g., onset  of 
physical  or mental  health condition),  they will  refer participants to appropriate treatment  
immediately.  
 
7.3.2  Data  Management and Data  Quality  
 
Columbia University  will be responsible  for computerized  survey programming,  data capture,  
management, and analysis.  All study information will  be identified  through the Participant  
Identification Number (PID) on all  forms  and computerized files.  Data files will  be exported from  
the ACASI  program  and imported  into the SPSS  database  for storage.  Computer  data files never  
have any identifying information and are encrypted prior  to transfer  between study sites.  Data  
entered  into the  SPSS database  will not include any  identifying information.  Only authorized  
users with  a login  name  and password will  be able to open  the computerized  survey,  and only 
those with administrative  privileges will  be able to access data.  The study research  assistant  
(RA) will  use a login name  and password  to gain access to the software  to administer  it to a 
participant,  but they will have no  ability to access  the saved data.  The database,  data structure,  
and data quality  will be routinely reviewed  by Dr. Schnall,  and the Data  Manager will set  up the 
database,  check data  quality,  and prepare  the data for  use. The Multiple  PIs will work closely to 
plan analyses  for various  purposes,  including  for hypothesis  testing  and manuscript  development  
and reports.  Data quality will  be examined before statistical  analyses are conducted,  including  
examination  of missing  data,  
assessment  of distributional  assumptions,  and identification  of outliers.  In addition  to data quality,  
the comparability between  intervention and control groups will  be carefully examined,  including  
baseline  balance and  differential  attritions at  all waves  of follow -up. While differences are not  
expected from the  randomized design,  it is prudent  to plan for  this contingency  so that sufficient  
follow -up data and appropriate  statistical  methods can  be used for  intent -to-treat analyses.  The 
psychometric properties of  instruments will  also be examined,  as will the patterns  of missing  
data.  
 
7.3.3  Data  Monitoring  
 
For the study,  weekly  reports  for the sites will be created  by the data manager  to review  relevant  
app engagement  data,  barriers with recruitment/enrollment  and retention,  urine  sample  
collection,  compliance  with the protocol,  and accuracy  and completeness of  the records. The  
investigative team  will hold reoccurring conference  calls,  and these  reports will be briefly  
reviewed by the team  at these meetings.  These regular  reviews  will ensure  close  
communication between the  research assistants,  quickly identify missing  data points,  and 
ensure consistent  management  of any issues with the protocol  between  sites.  
 
Data  quality  will be examined  before  statistical  analyses  are conducted,  including  examination  of

 contingency so that sufficient  follow -up data and appropriate statistical  methods can be used  for 
intent -to-treat analyses.  
 
7.3.4  Data  Safety  and Monitoring  Board  
 
The contact  Principal  Investigator (PI)  will enlist a Data  and Safety Monitoring  Board (DSMB)  to 
oversee the data,  safety elements,  and overall  integrity of  the study.  The DSMB will:  1) monitor  
recruitment,  enrollment,  and adherence  of study  participants;  2) formulate  criteria  for modifying  or 
discontinuing  the intervention  of individual  subjects;  and 3) review  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs).  
The objectives of  the DSMB will  be to assess the safety  of the intervention trial  and to assure the  
highest  degree  of subject  safety.  We will work  with the NIMH  to identify  individuals  to serve  in this 
role. Monitoring  board  membership  will be reviewed  and approved  by NIMH.  Should  there  be any 
questions regarding  the independence  of the monitoring board  it will be addressed  and corrected  
if necessary.  
 
The biostatistician  with clinical  trials  expertise  and the data manager  will prepare  monitoring  
reports  in advance  of every  DSMB  meeting.  The DSMB  will remain  blinded  to randomization  
status  unless,  for safety reasons,  the DSMB,  in consultation  with the NIMH  Program  
Administrator, decides it  is important  to unmask the  data.  
 
The DSMB  will: 1) review  the protocol  as funded and make  suggestions for  any changes  
(especially  safety related);  2) assess the endpoints  suggested by the investigators;  3) review  
study progress  by reviewing  recruitment,  retention,  and compliance  of participants  and data  
quality;  4) determine  formatting  for data reports;  5) review  endpoints  for safety;  6) submit  written  
reports  and 
suggestions  to the team;  and 7) add to or modify  this list of objectives.  The Project  Director  will 
document  the minutes  of the meetings  and distribute  to the Chair  of the DSMB  for final approval  
or revision.  
 
7.4 Adverse  events  
 
7.4.1  Adverse event  assessment  
 
We anticipate  that the Data  Safety  and Monitoring  Board will  define  study -specific  serious  adverse  
events  (SAE)s.  While  we do not anticipate  any SAEs,  we will suggest  looking  for imbalance  among  
treatment  arms  with regard  to the following  criteria:  safety  and data security  and study  drop-out 
 
7.4.2  Adverse  event  reporting  
 
We will follow  the guidelines that  require investigators to promptly  notify the IRB  (within  days of  
the occurrence) when SAEs occur.  SAEs will be defined  as death,  life threatening illness,  
hospitalization  or prolongation  of hospitalization, and persistent/significant disability.  The IRB  
requires that  any SAE  that is unexpected and  related or possibly related to the research  
intervention  must  be reported.  SAEs that  are unrelated  to the research intervention do not have  
to be reported  to the IRB  (however,  we will report  these to the monitoring  entity and NIH). Risks  
that are described  in the  protocol  and consent  form do not  have to be reported  as SAEs unless  
34 
Protocol  Number:  AAAT8624  
Version  1.5 
11/09 /2023   
 the expected SAE occurs more frequently or is more serious than  expected.  One exception to 
this rule is  in the  case  of a death.  All deaths  must  be reported,  whether  or not the death was  
related  to the research.  
 
7.5 Data  Security  and Privacy  
 
Beginning  with the development  process  and throughout  the research  project,  we will follow  the 
privacy  and security  principles  set forth at healthhit.gov.  Our team  is familiar  with the importance  
of the privacy and security of  personal  health information  to engender individual  trust in the use 
of health IT applications.  We have  expertise  and experience in  this domain as we have  
developed  a number of  health  IT systems  funded through NIH and  the Agency for Healthcare  
Research and Quality for persons  living  with HIV whose  personal  health information  is usually  
held to higher security  standards than traditional  patients,  as HIV  has historically  been a 
stigmatized  disease.  
We built the MyPEEPS App  (NIMHD  U01 MD011279) which  is housed on the  CUIMC  IT 
servers.  The CUIMC  servers  are located in  a secure datacenter,  with necessary redundancies.  
Currently the network  can be accessed  remotely via  Virtual  Private Network  with a Citrix  
solution  being developed.  All servers have HIPAA  compliant  security.  
 
CUIMC  has an Information  Security  Office  (ISO)  that facilitates  all aspects  of information  security  
risk management at  CUIMC,  with a particular focus on  threat  management  and HIPAA  
compliance.  This includes administration and enforcement  of information security policies on  
campus.  ISO also provides guidance to CUIMC  schools  and departments regarding  any 
information  security concerns they  may have.  The ISO collaborates with the  entire CUIMC  
community  to protect  the confidentiality, integrity, and availability  of critical  information  and 
computer  resources.  The ISO  strives to implement  secure computing infrastructure and  
practices with sensitivity to CUIMC's  educational  and research environment.  Columbia  
University has an information security charter  which is the foundation of  all of the work carried  
out by Dr.  Schnall and her research  team.  In specific,  Dr. Schnall  will work  with the CUIMC  IT 
server  group and  the information  security  office to protect  the confidentiality, integrity,  and 
availability  of participants’  data.  Confidentiality  means that  information is only  accessible to 
authorized  users.  Integrity means safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of  data and 
processing  methods.  Availability  means ensuring that  authorized users,  such as research  
participants,  have access to data and associated information resources when  required.  
 
Prior to assent  and consent,  study  participants will be informed  as to what  data the 
applications will  collect.  Data will  be encrypted and stored  securely  on the CUIMC  IT 
servers.  As a starting point  for ensuring privacy and  security,  all smartphones will  be 
password –protected.  In addition,  there  will be an additional  password for the  App so that 
only study  subjects will  be able  to open  the App.  
 
7.5.1  Procedures  to Ensure  Compliance with Monitoring Plan  and ReportingRequirements  
 
Biweekly  reports  for the sites will be created  by the study  statistician  to review  relevant  app 
engagement  data,  barriers  with recruitment/enrollment  and retention,  laboratory  and medical  
records,  compliance  with the protocol,  and accuracy  and completeness  of the records.  The 
 
35 
Protocol  Number:  AAAT8624  
Version  1.5 
11/09 /2023  
36  
 investigative team  will schedule  biweekly conference  calls,  and these reports  will be briefly  
reviewed by the team. These  regular reviews  will ensure  close  communication between  the 
research  assistants,  quickly  identify  missing  data points,  and ensure  consistent  management  
of any issues with the protocol  between  sites.  
 
7.6 Data  Analysis  Plan  for Aim 2 
 
Assessment  of feasibility  and acceptability  of the intervention  (Table  5). We have  
specified  the following  measures of  feasibility and acceptability:  Retention Rates,  
Compliance  Rates, Dose, Eligibility  Criteria,  Recruitment and  Enrollment,  Missing  Data,  
Study  Measures(68 -70).

Study  Outcomes.  The pilot study will  be used to assess  the preliminary efficacy  of 
MyPEEPS  Mobile  for YTM. Our  primary  outcome  will be the number  of condomless  
receptive  anal and/or  vaginal  sex acts with either  a cisgender  male  or transgender  woman.  
To estimate the effect  size for a larger clinical  trial, we will focus on the  primary outcome  
of: Condomless receptive  anal or vaginal sex acts.  The measures  listed  in Table  6 have  
been  used in  our MyPEEPS  trialand  piloted  with 49 YTM  as part  of our formative  
work for  this application.  We will collect  all measures at  baseline,  3 and 6 months,  other  
than demographic variables  which will  only be collected at  baseline.  We also ask 
participants  to report  on their own knowledge  of their most  recent  partners’  use of  PrEP or  
ART medications. Given the  unreliability of perceptions of partner -related  risk in  
particular(71),  we will use  these  data for  a secondary sensitivity  analysis  (see below).  This 
study is not  powered for efficacy  or tests  of moderation  or mediation;  nonetheless,  the 
purpose  of the inclusion  of these  factors  is to measure  the impact  of the intervention  on

Data  Analysis.  All multivariate  analyses will  be preceded by  standard  descriptive bivariate  
analyses  to describe  key variables  and relationships  among  key variables.  These  analyses  will 
include  means,  frequency tables,  histograms,  and examination of  distributions.  All statistical  
tests  will be two-sided  tests  with the level of significance at  0.05(60).  
Outcomes:  This study  will examine  whether  the intervention  will reduce  the number  of condomless  receptive  anal   
or vaginal  penile  sex with  either  a cisgender  male  or transgender  woman;  the primary  outcome  is a count  
measure (Table 6 - Outcome Measures).  We assume that  all count  outcome variables follow  
Poisson  or negative  binomial  (NB) distribution,  y~Poi(λ) or  y~NB(λ, κ) and all percentage  outcomes  
follow  binomial distribution,  y~bin(n,  p). Let the  expected  value  of outcome, E(y)  = φ, so φ = λ for 
count  oua tcomes  and φ = p for binary  outcomes.  We propose  the following  generalized  linear  
mixed model  (GLMM) to analyze  all outcomes.  The level  of analysis  
will be assessed at  each data point.  For person i and data assess  wave W (i.e., baseline,  3, and 6 
months):

 outcomes and  logit-links (logistic regression)  for binary  
outcomes. μi  iid~N(0, σj  ) are personal  level random  
effects  for the interceptor. Variables  Arm,  W, and INT 
are design  variables.  The codes  for the design  variables are  presented in  Table 7.  Variable  Arm is  
the 
indicator  for intervention arms (0=intervention arm and 1=delayed  intervention arm);  variable W is 
data assess wave indicator  (0=baseline, 1=3 months,  2=6 months);  and variable INT  is the  
intervention  indicator  (0=pre -intervention,  and 1=post -intervention).  COV  is a vector of  personal  
level covariates  at the baseline,  such as age, sex, etc., and 𝐗𝐗𝐗𝐗𝐗𝐗𝐗𝐗𝐗𝐗𝐗𝐗𝐗𝐗𝐗𝐗  is a vector  of time-dependent  
covariates assessed at each wave  of data for each  subject  controlling for  potential bias between  
two arms.  This model  will include  both baseline  personal  level covariates  as well as personal -wave  
level covariates to control  for different  types  of potential confounders.  Regression parameter  β3 is 
the mean  value change  for the outcome  variables between  pre- and post -intervention  and 
measures the impact  of the intervention on  each outcome variable.  For the Poisson  or NB models,  
exp (β3)  is the ratio of mean  counts  (i.e., risk  ratio)  between  post and pre-intervention.  For the 
logistic models,  exp (β3) is the odds  ratio between pre - and post-intervention.  If the  count  outcome  
has excess  0s (for  example,  much greater  than expected  number  of people  who had  0 receptive  
condomless anal  or vaginal  sex act as comparison to number of  people who  had 1,2,..,etc.  number  
of receptive condomless  anal or vaginal sex acts),  the above Poisson  or negative  binomial  GLMMs  
can be extended to zero-inflated  Poisson or  negative binomial  models(82).  
Sensitivity  Analysis:  To address  whether  PrEP  use by the partner  or the viral suppression  status  
of a HIV+ partner  affects the outcome,  we will ask participants  if their partner(s) use  PrEP,  use 
PrEP regularly or  if their partner  is HIV+ are virally suppressed  and we will conduct  a 
counterfactual  sensitivity analysis(83,  84), which includes the following  steps:  1) We will 
examine if  there is any difference  in partners’ PrEP use and/or HIV status between pre - and 
post- intervention.  This comparison can be  done using  the same  GLMM  for the primary  
outcome,  treating  partners’  PrEP  use and/or  HIV status  as the outcome.  2) We will examine  the 
impact (or  association) of  partners’  PrEP use and/or HIV status on condomless anal  sex based  
on a GLMM or  LMM.  3) If there  are difference in  step 1)  AND significant  effects in step  2), our 
estimation of  the impact  of intervention on main outcome will  be biased.  We will correct  
estimates  by estimating  the true  causal effect of  impact  on mainoutcome.  
Secondary  Outcomes:  We will use GLMM  to analyze  secondary  outcomes  with appropriate  choice  
of link functions  according to the outcomes.  All analyses  will be done  on the  final data set  
(baseline n=80).  As an objective of  this R34,  we will quantify  intervention effect  sizes of  program  
impact  on risky sexual  behavior  and substance  use. To gauge  effect  sizes,  we will use Cohen’s  d 
(85) and  Hedge’s g corrected for sample size(86),  both of  which  express the  average amount  of 
individual  change  between experimental  and control groups in  terms of  units  of standard  
deviation. In addition,  we will  also estimate the correlations within  outcomes across timepoints as  
the magnitude of  this correlation can have  significant  impact  on power to detect  effects  in 
repeated measures analyses.  These estimates of  effect  size will  enable us to accurately  
determine the sample size necessary to achieve  adequate statistical  power in  future  
investigations of  program efficacy  within this population.  We will use the following outcomes to 
estimate the statistical power for  a larger study:  (1) number of  receptive condomless anal or  
vaginal  sex acts with male partners  (e.g.,  cisgender  males and transgender  women) during  the 
past 3 months,  and (2)  number of  HIV tests during  the past  3 months.  We will estimate the  
statistical  power to examine overall  effect  with the  total subjects to conduct  stratified  analysis to 
examine the effects in some subgroups  (such as  by sex and/or  for some  racial/ethnicity  
Protocol  Number:  AAAT8624  
Version  1.5 
11/09 /2023  
39  
 subgroups). All  power  estimations will  be based  on α=0.05  and 2-sided tests. We will base our  
power estimates on the retention  rate at  the 3 -month and 6-month follow  up assessment  for each  
study  arm, the intra -cluster  correlation.  
Given  these parameters, if  the findings from  the pilot study  indicate  that at  post-intervention  
the number  of receptive condomless  anal or vaginal sex acts during  the past 3 months  
decreased  by 45% or a relative risk  (RR) of  0.55,  then for a future R01 study,  we will have at  
least  99% power to detect  such  difference for a total sample size of  320. Secondly,  for the  
stratified analyses,  we will have 87% power  to detect  a relative  risk of  0.55 in subgroups  with a 
sample size of 64. For the HIV testing outcome,  if the number of  HIV tests  during the past  3 
months increases by  75% (i.e.,  RR 
=1.75),  a sample size of  320 participants will  have  an 84% power to detect  such difference.   
Paradata:  we will  assess participants’ use of  the App over  time through the collection of  
paradata(87),  specifically the  page accessed,  time stamp  and device  type.  Paradata  is considered  
“free”  in that  it does not  require any additional effort  from the user(88) Data Analysis: At the 
individual  level,  we will understand participants’  use of  the App over time  through the collection  of 
paradata(87) which is “free” in that  it does  not require any  additional  effort  from the user(88).  To 
explore  barriers  and facilitators  to widespread implementation  of MyPEEPS  Mobile  for YTM, we  
will collect  data during  intervention,  implementation,  and after  the trial has ended.  The primary  
paradata to be collected are page  accessed,  time stamp, and device  type.  From  these  data,  we 
will derive  the following  use of data for each  session:  duration on  each page,  page  progression  
through the application,  time from login to result,  and total  time from login to logout.  We will 
analyze  the data at  the individual -level (i.e., user-level),  application -level,  page -level,  and 
session - level and assess  how these  differ  by demographic  characteristics,  technology  use, 
and outcome measures.  Additionally,  we will measure  the amount  in bytes  of user data 
transmitted.  Importantly,  longitudinal  analysis  will determine  if the user experience changes with  
repeated use.  The paradata collected  from each  page will be  analyzed to generate a “heatmap”  
of user-interaction  (i.e., the distribution  of activity  for each link/button) that  will inform  
user duration  on each  page  of the App and user interaction  with App content,  contact  pages,  and 
the help page.  We will explore usability  issues with  consideration for  how many times  users  
accessed help and what  page of  the App referred them  to the help,  implying  the need for  
clarification. We will analyze differences  in 
aggregated  data by demographic  group  (e.g.,  age) to better  understand  engagement  with the 
intervention  and potential  facilitators  and barriers to App use. 
 
7.6.1  Data Analysis  for Aim  3 
 
All in-depth  interviews  will be transcribed  verbatim  and then coded.  The development  and 
application  of a coding  scheme  is an integral  component  of the data analysis  process.  It enables  
the systematic  examination  and interpretation  of the data related  to the primary  analytic  foci. The 
coding scheme is  conceptualized  as a multilevel  structure.  At the highest  level are the primary  
analytic foci coded as  headings.  Specific  aspects or  dimensions of the headings  are assigned  
core codes.  Specific  aspects or  dimensions of the core  codes  are assigned  sub-codes.  We will 
use NVivo ™ (QSR  International,  Victoria,  Australia),  a software  program  for qualitative  analysis,  
to facilitate  the analysis.  
The following 7 steps  will be used to develop the coding  scheme:  Step 1:  Identify the  principal  
issues discussed  by participants;  Step 2:  Construct  definitions of  the primary analytic themes;  
Protocol  Number:  AAAT8624  
Version  1.5 
11/09 /2023  
49  
 Step 3: Develop and  apply core codes and sub -codes to the initial  set of interviews;  Step 4: 
Develop  a provisional  coding scheme;  Step 5: Test and refine the  provisional  coding scheme;  
Step 6:  Reconcile coding differences and construct  an updated and final coding scheme;  Step 7:  
Apply  the coding  scheme  to the full data set and assess  inter-coder  reliability.  After  all transcripts  
have been  coded,  we will extract  and examine  the content  of text segments  linked to core codes  
and sub- codes relevant  to understanding  barriers and  facilitators to the  use of  the MyPEEPS  
App. Based on  the coded  data,  we will propose  ways in  which certain  themes are  analytically  
related. A careful  examination of  the coded text  will reveal  the associations among these  themes  
and may lead to more  refined data searches.  Once we establish patterns of  relationships among  
themes  and issues,  we will identify  participants’  accounts  that support  or refute  these  patterns.  
Identifying  and accounting for cases that  deviate from  an interpretative pattern enables  us to test 
and confirm the  pattern’s validity  and robustness.  
Triangulation  of Findings.  We will examine  changes  in HIV risk behaviors  and its relationship  to 
factors  including but  not limited to changes in substance use,  alcohol  use, stigma,  victimization.  
We will triangulate  the findings  from our quantitative  outcome  measures  (Aim 2) with the findings  
from our  qualitative data (Aim  3) to better understand participants’ decisions for their  HIV risk 
behaviors.  
 
7.7 Missing  Data  
 
Missing data  may occur in  the proposed study  in several ways.  First,  it may be due  to item non - 
response.  In these  cases,  we will  prorate total  scores  for a measure  by taking  an average  score  
on the measure and multiplying it  by the total  number of  items  in the scale.  Attrition can result  in 
missing data  due to missed assessments  or dropout  from the  study.  Prior to performing any 
outcome analyses,  we will evaluate the amount,  reasons,  and patterns of missing data.  Missing  
data unrelated to the outcome of  interest  will be considered missing  completely at  random  
(MCAR),  and complete case analysis will still  generate unbiased estimates.(89)  For the missing  
values at  the baseline or partial baseline collected  data,  we will use  a multiple  imputation  
approach.(89)  We will conduct  sensitivity  analyses  to compare  estimates  of treatment  effects  with 
and without  multiple  imputation  to assess  the effect  of missing  data on statistical  inference.  
 
8.1 HUMAN  SUBJECTS  PROTECTIONS  
 
8.2 Informed  Consent  and Assent  
 
The study plan,  advertisements,  or recruitment  letters,  lay description of  the study,  and all 
consent  forms will be submitted  to the  IRB following  proposal  acceptance  and prior to study  
initiation. MPI,  Dr. Schnall,  will be responsible for obtaining IRB approval  for this study.  
Recruitment  for study  participation will occur following IRB approval.  The MPIs will  delegate  
study task  to research  staff including  determining eligibility  for inclusion,  explaining  the purpose  
of the study,  answering any  questions,  and obtaining e -assent/consent  from the participants.  
Individuals  who agree  to participate will  sign an  e-assent/consent  form.  Potential  risks and 
strategies for risk management  will be carefully explained as  part of informed e -assent/consent  
procedures. All  HIPAA  requirements will  be applied  to this study.  
Protocol  Number:  AAAT8624  
Version  1.5 
11/09 /2023  
41  
 8.2.1  Consent and Assent  Process  
Written informed  e-assent  will obtained from  study participants under age 18.  Participants at  age 
17 will  be considered  children for purposes of  study activities.  As such,  they will complete  
informed assent  for these portions  of the study.  Study participants  ages 18 and above  will 
provide written informed  consent.  If a respondent  asks any questions  about  the study,  an on -site 
research assistant  will clarify  or answer  questions.  The participant’s ability  to not respond to any 
study questions and/or  terminate  participation at  any time will be  stated clearly  in consent  forms.  
 
8.2.2  Parental  consent  
Consistent  with our prior  studies  in this  population,  we will not  require  parental  consent  for study  
enrollment.  Parental consent  may decrease participation  rates because  some youth  (17-year- 
olds) will  fear that they may  be “outed”  as a result  of participation.  Disclosure  of sexual  
orientation  or gender identity  may place participating youth  at risk  for parental  harassment,  
abuse,  or expulsion from  the home.  The nature  and scope  of the proposed research  do not  pose  
more than “minimal risk” to participants,  or that  “the probability and  magnitude  of harm  or 
discomfort  anticipated  in the  research are  not greater  in and of  themselves than  those  ordinarily  
encountered in  daily life or  during  the performance  of routine physical or  psychological  
examinations or tests”  (45 CFR Part 46.102). Study measures are standard  in this population,  as 
are waivers  of parental  permission  for survey and interview studies.  
 
8.2 Waiver  of Parental  Written  Consent  and Screening  Procedure  Written  Consent  
 
Each study site has  experience conducting  HIV prevention  research with minors.  We will be 
applying  for a waiver  of written  informed  consent  from the parents  of study  participants  because  
the involvement  of children  in this research  meets  the criteria  for waiving  parent  permission  (45 
CFR 46.116(d)).  The study  qualifies  for a waiver  of parental  consent  as the following  criteria  are 
met in this  study: 
• The research  involves  no more  than minimal  risk to the subjects  - The study does  not 
place  the patient  at any additional  risk than using  their smartphones  during  their everyday  
lives.  
The only other  risk to participants  is a breach  of their protected  health  information,  and we 
have put  systems in place to protect  their identity.  
• The waiver  or alteration  will not adversely  affect  the rights  and welfare  of the subjects  - 
If parents are required  to consent their  children then  this may  present  a breach  of 
confidentiality  related to participants’  sexuality and sexual  behaviors.  
• The research  could not  practicably be  carried out  without  the waiver or  alteration - If 
consent  is required from  parents  then this may  jeopardize the  confidentiality of  our study  
participants’  health behaviors  and may place  study participants  at increased risk  of 
adverse outcomes associated with disclosure of  their sexual  orientation to their parents.  
Past research  has shown  a higher  risk of familial  childhood  maltreatment  among  lesbian,  
gay, and bisexual individuals than  among  heterosexualindividuals.  
• Whenever  appropriate,  the subjects  will be provided  with additional  pertinent  information  
after participation - All study subjects will be given a copy of  the written assent  form 
which  will include  contact  information  of our study  team  as well as referral  information.  
To compensate  for the waiver  of parental  consent,  participants  receive  the described  formal  
individual  assessment  of capacity  to consent  (above)  to ensure  their understanding  of study  
Protocol  Number:  AAAT8624  
Version  1.5 
11/09 /2023  
42  
 goals,  procedures,  and risks from disclosure of  sensitive information.  Consistent  with national  
policy recommendations from  the Society for  Adolescent  Medicine,  requiring parental  
permission  for the  proposed study would  have  a number  of possible  negative effects, including:  
(1) reducing the validity of  the findings by  effectively eliminating potential  participants unwilling to 
share permission  forms  with their parents/guardians;  (2) increasing  risk to some  youth  whose  
parents have  a negative  response to the material  in the permission  forms  that would  (correctly)  
suggest  their child has  a minority or alternative  sexual orientation;  and (3)  contributing little  to 
actual  subject  protection,  given the minimal  risk of  study  participation.  
 
We are also requesting a waiver of  documentation of  consent  for online screening procedures.  
The screening information will only be kept  electronically  in REDCap,  which is  a secure,  CUMC  
approved  system.  
 
8.3 Vulnerable  Subjects:  Protecting  Against/Minimizing  Potential  Risk  
 
8.3.1  Procedures in the  event  of a reactive HIV  test. 
In the event  a participant  has a reactive  HIV test, study  team  members  will counsel  the participant  
regarding  the meaning  of their result.  Specifically,  the study  team  will reiterate  with the participant  
that: 
• Their  result  is a preliminary  positive,  and it is likely  that they are infected with  HIV, 
• The preliminary positive result  needs to be verified with confirmatory  testing,  
• They  need  to return  for the  results of  their confirmatory  testing,and  
• Resources for counseling  and referral to care are available to them.  
 
The participant  will be referred  for follow -up testing  and care.  We have  one physician  and one 
nurse as part  of our investigator  team.  
 
8.4 Risks  
 
8.4.1  Overview  of Potential  Risks  
 
There  is no more  than a minimal  risk associated  with any of the proposed  study  activities.  The 
study  activities  meet  the general  definition  found  in Subpart  A (46.102)  that the probability  and 
magnitude  of harm  or discomfort  anticipated  in the research  are not greater  in and of themselves  
than those  ordinarily encountered  in daily life  or during  the performance of  routine  physical  or 
psychological  assessments or  tests.  The risks of  participating in this study are  few. Potential  
risks are those related  to venipuncture, discomfort with study interview  questions,  and potential  
breaches of confidentiality.  It is possible  that certain  questions on  the survey  may make  
participants  feel uncomfortable,  but participants  are free to decline  to answer  any questions.  
Additionally,  clinical  study  sites have  co-located mental  health and/or counseling  services that  
may be  consulted should  a participant  enter  crisis.  Participation in research  can involve  loss of 
privacy.  All study  data will be maintained  on Columbia  University  Irving  Medical  Center  (CUIMC)  
and Lurie  Children’s  Hospital servers  that are secure and HIPAA  compliant.  All signed consent  
forms,  study data,  and payment  receipts used in  this study  will be kept  in locked  files at  both 
sites which  only the  investigators can access.  We will also  receive a Federal Certificate of  
Confidentiality  which will  protect  against  attempts by law  enforcement  or other government  
Protocol  Number:  AAAT8624  
Version  1.5 
11/09 /2023  
  
 agencies to access our  data.  
 
8.4.2  General  Risks  
There may  be risks or discomforts  in participating  in this  study.  Participants  may feel  
uncomfortable  with the  HIV prevention information that  is provided  and completing some  
questions in the survey.  Participants may skip  any HIV information  or questions that  may make  
them feel uncomfortable or  stop the research  procedure.  People around  may observe 
participants  using  the MyPEEPS Mobile application.  If participants are concerned about people 
seeing them  use of MyPEEPS Mobile, it is  important  that they access the application in  private 
location.  
 
8.4.3  Loss  of confidentiality  
 
A risk of  taking part  in this study is the  possibility of  a loss of confidentiality or  privacy.  Loss  of 
confidentiality  or privacy  means  having  personal  information  shared  with someone  who is not 
on the study team  and was  not supposed  to see or know about  your information.  All study 
data will be stored in password  protected  computers or file cabinets in locked offices.  All 
research team  members  will pass the protection of  human subjects and research HIPAA  
exams and sign a protocol -specific  conflict  of interest.  All procedures have been designed  to 
protect  each  participant's  privacy  and allow  for anonymous  participation.  All study  data will be 
maintained  in a completely  secure  and HIPAA  compliant  environment.  All CUIMC  servers  
have  HIPAA  compliant  security  
 
8.5 Social  Impact  Events  
 
Individuals  enrolled  in this  study may experience  personal  problems  resulting  from the study  
participation.  Such problems are termed social impact  events.  Although study sites will make  
every effort  to protect  participant  privacy and  confidentiality,  it is possible that  participants'  
involvement  in the  study could  become known  to others, and that  participants may  
experience  stigmatization  or discrimination  as a result  of being  perceived  as being  HIV 
infected  or at risk for HIV infection.  For example,  participants  could  be treated  unfairly,  or 
could  have  problems  being  accepted by  their families  and/or communities.  Problems  may 
also occur in  circumstances  in which study  participation is  not disclosed,  such  as impact  on 
employment  related to time taken  for study  visits.  
In the event  that a participant  reports a social impact  event,  every  effort  will be made by study  
staff to provide  appropriate assistance, and/or referrals  to appropriate  resources. Social  
impact  events  are documented  and reviewed  on a scheduled  basis  by the protocol  team  
leadership  with the goal  of reducing their incidence and  enhancing the ability of  study staff to 
mitigate them  when  possible.  
Social  impact  events  that are judged  by the MPIs/designee  to be serious,  unexpected,  or more  
severe or  frequent  than anticipated,  will be reported to the responsible site’s Ethics  
Committee/Institutional Review  Board  (EC/IRB)  promptly,  or otherwise  in accordance  withthe 
EC/IRB’s  requirements.  
 
8.6 Benefits  
 
The potential benefits to an individual participant  in the  study  are not  known.  The potential  
benefits of  the study  to others could be  considerable.  If our hypotheses  are true,  this study  will 
Protocol  Number:  AAAT8624  
Version  1.5 
11/09 /2023  
  
 make a significant  contribution towards improving  HIV incidence in  YTM.  This study  has not  
been designed for  the direct  benefit  of its participants;  however, there are  a number of  ways in  
which they may derive benefit,  such as awareness of  HIV status,  increased access to HIV 
prevention tools (e.g.,  testing,  PrEP)  and HIV services, if  a participant  sero-converts. The  
proposed research will inform the delivery of  HIV prevention  messages.  The knowledge gained  
will contribute to the body of  knowledge regarding the use of  health information technology for  
improving  the lives of YTM  at risk for HIV. The  avoidance of HIV  throughout study  participation  
will be a significant  personal benefit  to participants.  
 
8.7 Participant  Privacy  and Confidentiality  
 
Access  to individually identifiable  private  information about  human  subjects.  Access to 
individually  identified private information about  human subjects will  be limited to research  team  
members  who collect  and manage the data,  the Project  Director,  and the  MPIs.  De-identified  
data will be  accessible  to all members  of the research  team  involved in  the data analysis.  
 
Our study  team  is extremely  prudent  in keeping subject data secure  and confidential.  All 
laboratory specimens,  evaluation  forms, reports,  and other records  will be identified by  a unique  
coded number to maintain participant  confidentiality.  The material,  records,  and data  obtained  
through participation in the study  will be specifically for research purposes.  Existing health  
records may be  used with  the permission  of the participants.  Materials  will be obtained by 
trained  clinical  staff at each study site.  Data  will be stored using Research Electronic Data  
Capture  (REDCap) at  each respective performance site,  and then the completely deidentified  
data will  be merged at  CUIMC.  All laboratory  specimens  will be identified  only by the 
identification number.  The code linking the participant  identification  number to subject  identifying  
information  (name,  address,  etc.) is maintained at the clinical  sites through  REDCap,  and only 
authorized  site personnel  have  access to the code.  Limited individually  identifiable private  
information is collected  that is essential for processing  participant  payments and  for analysis  
purposes.  
 
All study data will  be stored in password -protected computers or  file cabinets in locked offices.  
All research team members will  pass the protection of  human subjects and HIPAA research  
exams and  sign a protocol -specific conflict  of interest.  Risks will  be minimized  by not  including  
personal  
identifying  information  on the forms,  when  possible,  and by conducting  interviews  and collection  of 
personal information in a private  setting.  All data will be  collected using  unique  patient  
identification  codes.  All laboratory  specimens,  evaluation  forms,  reports,  and other  records  will be 
identified by  a coded number  to maintain  participant  confidentiality.  All records  will be stored in  a 
locked file  cabinet.  Study  data from  both sites  will be collected and  managed  using  REDCap.  
REDCap is  a secure web  application designed  to support  data capture  for research  studies,  
providing user - friendly web -based  case report  forms,  real-time data entry validation  (e.g.,  for 
data types  and range checks),  audit  trails,  and a de-identified  data export  mechanism to 
common  statistical  packages  (SPSS,  SAS,  Stata,  R/S-Plus).  REDCap  data collection  projects  
rely on a thorough  study -specific  data dictionary  defined  in an iterative  self-documenting  process  
by all members  of the research  team.  This iterative  development  and testing  process  results  in a 
well-planned data collection strategy  for individual  studies.  REDCap  also includes a powerful  tool 
for building  and managing  online  surveys.  The research  team can create  and design surveys  ina 
web browser and engage potential  respondents using a variety of  notification  methods. REDCap  
is flexible  enough  to be used  for a variety of types of  research  and provides  an intuitive user

 interface for database  and survey design  and data entry.  Lastly,  clinical  information  will not be 
released without  written  permission of  the participant,  except  as necessary for monitoring by  the 
IRB or the  NIH. 
 
8.7.1  Confidentiality  of Study  Data  
 
We have developed systematic protocols  for data handling and storage  over multiple cohort  
studies. To protect  the integrity of  the participant’s data, the RA will  assign each  participant  a 
unique  PID at study  enrollment.  This code  number  will be used  for all study  data.  We will maintain  
a list of participants  with links between  identifying information and  code  numbers for  the sole 
purpose  of avoiding any duplication in  completion of  the survey. Only the PIs,  RAs,  and Project  
Director will have  access  to these  lists, which  will be kept  behind  double -locks  or on a secure  
server with  password protected access.  Computer files consist  of the tracking database  
(REDCap),  and study  data files downloaded  from the database.  Tracking  files are maintained  in a 
highly secure  scheduling  and monitoring  database  which both  sites can access.  This database  
contains all  contact  information  and is used  to schedule  and track  study visits;  it is completely  
password protected  and user access and  privileges  will be managed  by the data manager  and 
Project Director.  The tracking database  stores contact  preferences including information the  
participant  agreed to provide for the  purposes of  tracking  and communication;  all 
communications  strictly follow  the participants’  contact  limitations.  Data files are exported  from 
REDCap  and imported into the SPSS database for storage and analysis.  Computer data files  
never have  any identifying information and are encrypted for  transfer between  study sites.  Data  
files do  not include  information that  could be used to identify the  participant  from the data  file 
alone.  Columbia  University  will provide  a standards -compliant  (HIPAA,  HHS  Cybersecure)  private  
cloud  server  for the hosting  of application  content  and user data for the duration  of the application  
deployment.  This is a secure system  and will  be further  protected by  login credentials  for limited  
access to protect  participant  confidentiality.  Participants will also be encouraged  to choose a 
private location to program a password for  the application and complete the intervention  modules  
for additional  security.  They will  be prompted to log-out of the website after  completing or  
progressing through any given  module.  
 
8.8 Certificate  of Confidentiality  
 
This research specifically targets a vulnerable population,  children - YTM age  17. We will take 
every available  step to minimize the  risk of identifying/linking  data being  subpoenaed,  stolen,  or 
inadvertently released.  First,  per Section 2012 of  the 21st Century Cures Act  as implemented in 
the 2017 NIH  Certificates  of Confidentiality Policy , all ongoing or new  research  funded by NIH as  
of December  13, 2016  that is collecting  or using  identifiable,  sensitive  information  is automatically  
issued a CoC.  As noted  on the NIH  website,  
(http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/COC/faqs.htm#187),  a Certificate  of Confidentiality  will help the 
research team “...avoid compelled ‘involuntary disclosure’  (e.g.,  subpoenas) of names and  other  
identifying  information  about  any individual  who participates  as a research  participant  (i.e., about  
46 
Protocol  Number:  AAAT8624  
Version  1.5

47  
 whom  the investigator maintains identifying information)  during any  time the Certificate is  in 
effect.”  Second,  all research staff  members are required to complete ethical  clearance  
certification  regarding protection  of human’s subjects  through their relevant IRBs.  Third,  all 
studies will  have documented procedures to safeguard against  the risk of  the linking information  
being stolen by  keeping such  information in  locked spaces  to which  only essential study  
personnel who have completed CITI  certification for human subjects research  ethics training  
(http://citiprogram.org ) will have  access.  
 
8.9 Unexpected  and Serious  Adverse  Event  Reporting  
 
A detailed  monitoring  plan will be included  as part of the study  protocol,  submitted  to the IRB, and 
reviewed and approved by  the NIMH  before the study begins.  Prior to initiation  of the study, 
agreement  about  the data safety  monitoring  plan will  be confirmed  to ensure the safety of  
subjects and the validity and integrity of  the data.  The research coordinator at  each site  will 
report serious adverse events (SAEs) that  are unexpected and study -related immediately  to a 
study  physician  who will convey  this information  to the study  team,  IRB, and the NIH. All AEs and 
SAEs will be captured,  reports will  be completed,  and information will  be entered into the study  
database. A safety report  will detail  all serious and  unexpected AEs or other  unanticipated  
problems  that involve risk  to study participants  or others  and whether  these appeared  to be 
related  to the study - based interventions or research assessment  protocols.  All AEs will  be 
reviewed  every 6 months,  or sooner, with the designated safety  Data Safety  and Monitoring  
Board.  
 
8.10 ClinicalTrials.gov  
 
This trial  and protocol  will be registered in  ClinicalTrials.gov.

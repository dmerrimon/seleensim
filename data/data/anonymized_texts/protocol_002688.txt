Not applicable
Study Number: Vedolizumab -4006 Phase: 4
Study Design:
A phase 4, open -label, multicenter study in subjects with newly -diagnosed Crohn’s disease (CD) at higher risk for 
complications due to aggressive disease. The study will investigate the efficacy and safety of triple combination 
therapy  (300 mg vedolizumab IV, 160/80/40 mg adalimumab SC, and 15 mg oral methotrexate) over a 26 -week 
treatment period for induction of endoscopic remission and mucosal healing followed by efficacy and safety of vedolizumab IV monotherapy to maintain remission for 76 weeks, for a total treatment period of 102 weeks.
The study will be conducted in the United States and Canada and will include 60 subjects with moderate to seve re CD 
and judged by the investigator to be at moderate -high risk for complications. CD must have been diagnosed within the 
previous 24 months and subjects must be naïve to biologics.
Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will receive vedolizumab 300 mg IV 
infusion on Day 1 and Weeks 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, 46, 54, 62, 70, 78, 86, 94, and 102; adalimumab 160 mg SC injection 
on Day 2, 80 mg at Week 2, then 40 mg ever y 2weeks thereafter until Week 26; and oral methotrexate 15mg weekl y 
from Day 1 through Week 34.
Primary Objectives:
To determine the effect of triple combination therapy with an anti -integrin (vedolizumab IV), a tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF) antagonist (adalimumab SC), and an immunomodulator (oral methotrexate) on endoscopic 
remission at Week 26.
Secondary Objectives:
To evaluate the effect of vedolizumab IV monotherapy on maintaining endoscopic remission at Week 102 
following triple combination therapy.
To evaluate the effect of triple combination therapy followed by vedolizumab monotherapy on endoscopic 
healing at Weeks 26 and 102.
To evaluate the effect of triple combination therapy followed by vedolizumab monotherapy on endoscopic response at Weeks 26 and 102.
To evaluate the effect of triple combination therapy followed by vedolizumab monotherapy on deep remission at 
Weeks 26 and 102.
To evaluate the effect of triple combination therapy followed by vedolizumab monotherapy on clinical remission by Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at Weeks 10, 26, 52, 78, and 102.
To evaluate the effect of triple combination therapy followed by vedolizumab monotherapy on clinical response by CDAI at Weeks 10, 26, 52, 78, and 102.
Additional Objectives:
To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab and adalimumab in CD subjects at higher risk for CD 
complications at Week 26.

Safety Endpoints:
Safety will be assessed by adverse events (AEs), adverse events of special interest (AESIs), serious adverse events 
(SAEs), adverse events leading to discontinuation, vital signs, physical examination, and results of standar d laboratory 
tests (clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis).
Statistical Considerations: 
For all dichotomous endpoints, corresponding rates and a 95% CIs will be reported. 
Time-to -event endpoints will be analyzed by survival analy sis procedures estimated by Kaplan -Meier product limit 
methods and presented with appropriate 95% CIs.Change f rom baseline in CDAI and PRO -2 scores will be analyzed using Wilcoxon signed -rank test for paired data;

Sample Size Justification:
The sample size was based on an estimate of precision. A sample size of 60 subjects will generate a 95% CI for 
endoscopic remission (defined a s SES -CD 0 -2) at Week 26 with a half width no wider than 12.7% and expected 
remission of 50%. If the expected remission rate is different from 50%, a required sample size would be smaller.

4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
4.1.1 Disease and Current Treatments
Inflammatory  bowel  disease (IBD) i s a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory  disorder of the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract that includes 2 ent ities, namely ulcerat ive colit is (UC) and Crohn’s 
disease (CD). In contrast to the diffuse, superficial , conti nuous inflammat ion limited to the colon 
in UC, the inflammat ion of CD is focal, may be transmural, and can invo lve any segment of the GI 
tract from mouth to anus. The prevalence of CD is approximately 150/100,000 of the United States 
(US) popul ation[1]. Thecharacteristic pathology invo lves a chronic inflammatory infiltrate 
consist ing of neutrophils and macrophages. Hallmarks of CD include granulo matous 
inflammat ion and aphthous ulcerat ion. CD is neither medically or surgi cally curable at the current 
time. 
Untreated CD patients commonly develop structural co mplications that include stricture and 
fistul a formation, which commo nly result in hospitalizat ions and surgery  over time. When 
examining 306 CD patients from the United States, Thia et al. showed that the cumulat ive risk of 
developing CD complications of either stricturing or penetrating disease was 33.7% at 5 years and 
50.8% at 20 years after establishment of CD diagnosis [2 ]. The natural course of the disease can 
range fro m an indolent course with prolonged periods of remission to aggressive, incapacitat ing 
disease associated with structural bowel wall damage. Certain patients have aggressive CD, which 
could be defined as having a high relapse rate, development of penetrating disease, need for repeat 
surgery , or m ultiple admissio ns for flares [3]. The pathophysio logy of IBD is complex as mult iple 
environmental factors interact with the genoty pe of an individual to cause expressio n of disease. 
Published risk factors for aggressive disease include involvement of the upper GI tract and ileum, 
penetrating disease, early age at diagnosis, smoking, extensive ulceration of the mucosa, high titers 
of certain serum ant ibodies, and m utations of  the nucl eotide-binding oligo merization 
domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) gene [4]. The abilit y to more readily predict which pat ients 
will be at higher risk for complicat ions and target more intensive, early  treatm ent to that group 
woul d be invaluable. The 2014 American Gastroenterology  Associ ation (AGA) Clinical Care 
Pathway  outlined cri teria for patients consi dered at m oderate -high risk for disease co mplications 
that included: <30 y ears of age at initial diagnosis, extensive anatomic involvement, perianal or 
severe rectal disease, deep ulcers, prior surgical resection or structuring, and/or penetrating 
behavior [5]. Addi tionally, the Crohn's Disease Personalized Risk and Outcome Prediction Tool 
(PROSPECT), which incorporates clinical, serological, and genet ic variables, has been developed 
by Siegel et al. This tool is used to predict the probabilit y of developing com plicat ions related to 
CD, specifically  strictures or internal penetrating disease. The output of the predict ive model 
allows ri sk stratificat ion of pat ients from low to medi um to hi gh risk of co mplications wit hin a 
3-year period [4,6]. Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Usesorder of the

4.1.2 Vedolizumab
Vedolizumab (also called MLN0002) is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclo nal 
antibody  (mAb) directed against the human lymphocyte integrin α4β7. The α4β7 integrin mediates 
lymphocy te trafficking to GI mucosa and gut- associated lymphoid t issue through adhesive 
interact ion with mucosal  addressin cell adhesion molecule- 1 (MAdCAM -1), whi ch is expressed 
on the endothelium o f mesenteric lymph nodes and GI mucosa [7-10]. Vedolizumab binds the 
α4β7 integrin, antagonizing its adherence to MAdCAM -1 and as such, impairs the migrat ion of gut 
homing lymphocytes into GI mucosa. As a result, vedo lizumab acts as a gut- selective 
immuno modulator [11]. 
Vedolizumab IV (also known as ENTYVIO; Vedolizumab for Inject ion, for Intravenous Use; 
Vedolizumab Powder for Concentrate for Solut ion for Infusio n; or MLN0002 IV) has been 
granted market ing approval in mult iple countries glo bally. Vedolizumab intravenous (IV) is 
approved for the treatment of adult pat ients with moderately to severely acute UC or CD who have 
had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to a tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF) blocker or immuno modulator; or had an inadequate response with, were intolerant to, or 
demonstrated dependence on corticosteroids. The approved dosing and administration regimen is 
300 m g vedolizumab IV infus ed intravenously  at Weeks 0, 2, and 6, then once every  8 weeks 
(Q8W) thereafter. 
Previously  conducted clinical  studi es have characterized the efficacy, safety , tolerabili ty, 
pharmacokinet ic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and immunogenicit y of vedo lizumab in healt hy 
subjects and subjects with UC or CD.
4.1.2.1 Nonclinical
Nonclinical in vitro and in vivo studies have been conducted with vedo lizumab and its murine 
homolo gue, murine predecessor to vedolizumab antibody (Act -1). Act -1 has demonstrated clinica l 
and histom orphologic evidence of efficacy in an animal model of IBD (cotton- top tamarins). 
Extensive nonclinical evaluations of the cardiovascular, acute, local, subchronic, chronic, 
immuno logic, and reproductive toxicit y of vedo lizumab in pharmaco logically  responsiv e species 
(New Zealand white rabbit s and cyno molgus mo nkeys) have been conducted and support its 
clinical development. Nonclinical studi es also show that vedolizumab does not antagonize α4β1 
integrin [11].
4.1.2.2 Human Experience
As of 19 May  2019, approximately  6376 subjects (679 healt hy subjects, 2671 subjects with UC, 
and 2920 subjects with CD) have received at least 1 dose of vedo lizumab across all studies in the 
clinical development program (see current version of Invest igator’s Brochure). Vedolizumab 
exposure has extended for ≥12months in 2553 subjects, ≥24 months in 1636 subjects, ≥36 months 
in 1126 subjects, ≥48months in 908 subjects, ≥60 mo nths in 675 subjects, and ≥72 m onths in 
378 subjects as of 19 May 2019. Based on drug shipment data, the patient exposure to 
vedo lizumab since its approval in May 2014 is estimated to be approximately 
336,400 patient -years.Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Usee human lymphocyte integrin α4β7. The α4β7 integrin mediates

In subjects wi th moderately  to severely act ive CD (Study C13007), including subjects who had 
failed treatment with 1 or more therapies including tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF- α) 
antagonists, vedolizumab 300 mg infusion at Weeks 0 and 2 (induct ion) fo llowed by eit her once 
every 4 weeks (Q4W) or Q8W fro m Weeks 6 through 52 (maintenance) demonstrated differences 
in efficacy co mpared to placebo for both the Induction Phase and Maintenance Phase. The study 
met its primary endpo int for the Induction Phase, clinica l remissi on at Week 6, but did not meet the 
second primary  endpoint of enhanced clinical response (Crohn’s Disease Activit y Index 
[CDAI] -100) at Week 6 in the overall population, although the treatment difference favored 
vedo lizumab. The study  did meet i tsprimary  endpoint for the Maintenance Phase, clinical 
remission at Week 52, as well as important secondary endpoints, including enhanced clinical 
response at Week 52 and corticosteroid -free clinical remissio n at Week 52 [12].
Rates of mucosal healing were recently reported in 27 CD subjects who received IV vedolizuma b 
monotherapy . Mucosal  healing was reported in 30% of subjects who had a baseline co lonoscopy  
before vedo lizumab, 73% of who m were not TNF -antagonist naïve. The subj ects’ second 
colonoscopy  occurred 12 to 52 weeks after vedolizumab induction (median of 22 weeks). Mucosal 
healing was defined as an absence of ulcerat ion. Endoscopic improvement was 52% [13].
Vedolizumab has shown an acceptable and consist ent safet y profile in clinical trials (see current 
versio n of IB). In the pivotal phase 3 studies (C13006 in UC and C13007 in CD), the most 
commo n (≥5% and at a higher incidence than placebo) adverse reactions in subjects administered 
vedo lizumab were nausea, nasoph aryngi tis, upper respiratory  tract infect ion, arthralgia, py rexia, 
fatigue, headache, and cough. Most serious adverse events (SAEs) have been related to 
exacerbations or complications of the underlying UC or CD. For those infect ions that were 
reported more frequent ly in vedo lizumab -treated subjects, the sites of these infect ions correlated 
with the known tissue distribut ion of MAdCAM -1 binding sites. Anal abscess, abdo minal abscess, 
and gastroenteritis were the most frequently reported serious infections. E xtraintestinal infect ions 
(bronchit is, pneumonia, urinary tract infect ion, sepsis) occurred at low frequency (<1%). A total of 
4% of vedo lizumab -treated subj ects and 3% of placebo -treated subjects experienced an 
infusio n-related reacti on. In C13006 and C13007, 10% of subjects were posit ive for 
anti-vedo lizumab antibodies 16 weeks fo llowing the last dose of vedo lizumab. Results fro m the 
clinical program to date do not suggest an increased risk for malignancy with vedo lizumab 
treatm ent. Overall, the safet y profile fo llowing l ong-term treatm ent wi th vedo lizumab in C13008, 
a long-term safet y study , is consistent with safet y in the completed studies.
Concomitant use of corticosteroids and/or convent ional immuno modulators di d not appear to be 
associ ated wi th any i ncreased rate of infect ions based on the comparative rates of infections in the 
phase 3 trials amo ng subjects who had and had not received these medicat ions. Overall, 
vedo lizumab was well tolerated in clinical studies. For addit ional safet y related inform ation from 
the clinical trials experience, see full prescribing informat ion [14].

Adalimumab also lyses surface TNF-α expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complem ent. 
Adalimumab does not bind or inact ivate lymphotoxin (TNF -β). TNF -α is a naturally occurring 
cytokine that i s invo lved in normal inflammatory  and immune responses. TNF -α plays an 
important role in both the path ologi c inflammat ion and the j oint destructi on that are hallmarks of 
inflammatory  diseases. Adalimumab also modulates bio logical responses that are induced or 
regul ated by  TNF -α, including changes in the levels of adhesio n molecules responsible for 
leukocy te migrati on.
Adalimumab is approved globall y for the treatm ent of moderately to severely act ive CD in patients 
who have had an inadequate response to convent ional therapy . Additionally, adalimumab is 
approved for reducing signs and symptoms and inducing clinical remissio n in t hese pat ients if t hey 
have also lost response to or are intolerant to infliximab.
Adalimumab 40 mg weekly or every other week has been shown to be effect ive for maintaining 
clinical remissio n in pat ients with CD who have responded to adalimumab induct ion therapy . 
Adalimumab has also been shown to have corticosteroid -sparing effects in patients with CD [15]. 
In CLASSIC I, a dose ranging, randomized, controlled induct ion trial of adalimumab, 299 subjects 
with moderate to severe CD who were naïve to TNF- α antagonists were evaluated. The study  
demonstra ted that an adalimumab loading dose regimen of 160 mg subcutaneous (SC) at Week 0 
and 80 mg SC at Week 2 was significantly more effect ive than placebo (36% vs 12%, p=0.001). 
CLASSIC II, a m aintenance follow -up tri al to CLASSIC I, dem onstrated that adalimumab SC 
every other week or weekly was superior to placebo in maintaining remissio n over a 56 -week 
period in 55 subjects wi th moderate to severe CD naïve to TNF -antagonist therapy who 
experienced remissio n with adalimumab induct ion therapy . In thi s rerando mized cohort of 
55subjects, 79% who received adalimumab 40 mg every  other week and 83% who received 
40mg weekly maintained remission through Week 56 (primary endpo int) compared wit h 44% for 
placebo (p< 0.05 for both adalimumab groups vs placebo). The subje cts from CLASSIC I who had 
not been in remissio n ent ered an open -label ar m and received adalimumab 40 mg ever y other week 
(dosages coul d be increased to 40 mg weekly if there was a nonresponse or flare) [16].
The CHARM study  included 854 subjects wi th moderate to severe CD who were TNF antagonist 
therapy  naïve, had been exposed to infliximab in the past, and had eit her lost response or become 
intolerant to infliximab. The primary endpo int was clinical remissio n at Weeks 26 and 56 am ong 
subjects who responded to adalimumab. The subjects received open -label adalimumab SC at doses 
of 80mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2 with response defined by a decrease in CDAI score of 
70points at Week 4. Overall, 499 (approximately  60%) subj ects responded at Week 4 and were 
rando mized to 1 of 3 treatment arms: adalimumab 40 mg every other week, adalimumab 40 mg 
weekly, or placebo. At Week 26, 40% of the adalimumab 40- mg every other week group, 47% of 
the adalimumab 40 mg weekly group, and 17% o f the placebo group were in remissio n (p=0.001 
for both groups compared to placebo, no difference between act ive groups). This benefit was 
maintained out to Week 56 wi th 36% of the adalimumab 40 mg every -other-week group, 41% of

The GAIN study , a pl acebo -controlled, rando mized, controlled trial evaluated 325 subjects with 
moderate to severe CD who had failed infliximab therapy (defined as intolerant of infliximab or 
having previously  responded then l ost response to infliximab). Subjects were treated with 
adalimumab (160 mg at Week 0 then 80 mg at Week 2) or placebo. A total of 301 subjects 
completed the tr ial, and at Week 4 induction of remission was greater for adalimumab than for 
placebo (21% vs 7% p<0.001) [18].
Adalimumab was well tolerated in the efficacy- based studi es discussed above. SAEs have been 
reported in 25% of patients, including inj ection-site reacti ons (20%), m alignant neoplasm (1.7%), 
opportunist ic infect ion (2.1%), and tuberculosis ([TB] 0.2%). Other adverse events (AEs) 
associ ated wi th adalimumab include increased risk of infections, ant ibody  formati on, 
autoimmunit y, skin eruptio n, abnorm al liver funct ion tests (LFTs), demyelizat ion, and congest ive 
heart failure.
4.1.4 Methotrexate 
Methotrexate is an antimetabolite that is approved for the treatment of certain neoplastic diseases, 
severe psoriasis, and adult rheumatoid arthritis. Methotrexate was originally developed as an 
antineoplastic, and is an inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofo late reductase, which catalyzes a 
reacti on in the production of tetrahy drofolic acid. This pathway is essent ial to the synthesis of the 
purine and pyrimidine components of DNA, and thus the drug slows cellular divisio n. Although 
the mechanism of act ion of low -dose methotrexate in the treatment of autoimmune disease is not 
well understood, there is evidence supporting both immunosuppressive and ant i-inflammatory
effects.
In rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate is a mainstay  of treatm ent because of its excellent 
anti-inflammatory  effect, rapi d onset of action, and acceptable safet y profile. Recent ly, 
methotrexate has beco me the agent of cho ice for combinat ion therap y with the newer bio logics in 
rheumatoi d arthri tis [19], [20], [21], [22].

Following oral  administrati on of  low-dose methotrexate (<5 mg), absorption approaches 100%. 
The pea k blood concentration is observed wit hin 1 to2 hours. Methotrexate is 50% protein bound, 
displacement occurs in compet ition with other hi ghly protein -bound compounds, and distribut ion 
is widespread. In 1987, Kozarek was the first to report the results of intramuscular methotrexate 
therapy  in pat ients with refractory  IBD (14 CD; 7 UC) and two -thirds of patients with steroid 
refractory  disease showed an improvement in symptoms and a concomitant reduction in 
prednisone requirements [23]. Some pat ients dem onstrated endoscopi c remissio n. In subsequent

these studies, steroid-dependent CD pati ents treated with 25 mg methotrexate intramuscularly 
each week achieved steroid -free remission rates in 39% compared with 19% on placebo, and 
maintained remis sion with 15mg methotrexate per week in 65% compared with 39% on placebo. 
In spite of these excellent clinical data for methotrexate in CD, it has never been widely ut ilized as 
a monotherapy in adults but is increasingly used clinically in co mbinat ion wit h bio logic therapy  to 
reduce immunogenicit y [24]. The co mbinat ion of maintenance methotrexate and infliximab in the 
COMMIT tri al is the m ost recent study  to dem onstr ate immunogenicit y efficacy  of methotrexate 
on infliximab trough and ant i-infliximab ant ibody  levels [27]. The study did not, however, reveal a 
difference in clinical outcomes between combinat ion methotrexate/infliximab and infliximab 
monotherapy , despite the posit ive effects of methotrexate on ant ibody  formation to infliximab and 
infliximab trough levels. These results are in contrast to the results of the study  of bi ologic and 
immuno modulatory -naive patients in the SONIC CD study , which demonstrated an increased 
effect iveness of azathioprine/infliximab combinat ion therapy co mpared with infliximab 
monothera py in inducing and maintaining remission, and was corroborated by higher infliximab 
trough l evels and lower ant i-infliximab antibodies [28].
The m ost frequently observed adverse event of methotrexate therapy  is nausea (in up to 25% of 
treated patients), which often can be well -controlled and/or avoided with conco mitant ondansetron 
tablets given 1 to2 hours before and 12 to 24 hours after methotrexate administration [24]. 
Methotrexate also may cause bone marrow suppression. In 1 series, mild leukopenia (white blood 
cell [WBC] count 2.8 -4.0×109/L) was encountered at least once in 21% of patients wi th 
rheumatoi d arthri tis treated wi th 15 m g weekly [29]. In all cases, leukopenia was transient, 
responded to minimal dose reduction, and did not lead to cessat ion of therapy . Although severe 
leukopenia and associated infect ion has been reported with methotrexate, it is rare with low- dose
therapy . Leukopenia is usually  correctabl e by dose reducti on and is almo st always asymptom atic. 
Thrombocy topeni a is rarely seen. Addit ionally , acute pulmo nary toxicity is an unco mmo n adverse 
reacti on to m ethotrexate. This hypersensit ivity reacti on present s with acute dyspnea associated 
with bilateral  alveol ar or intersti tial pulm onary changes. A high clinical index of suspicio n and 
prom pt treatment wi th steroi ds usually  leads to resol ution without chroni c sequelae. No increased 
incidence of cancer or lymph oma has been reported for methotrexate although overall rates of use 
are lower than that of other immunomodulator therapies [24]. Methotrexate may pro mote rise of 
liver enzymes, which is observed in 3% to 33% of IBD patients treated with methotrexate, and 
necessitates discont inuing therapy in around 6% to 8% [24]. Recommendat ions for stopping 
therapy  are based on the degree of absolute change in liver enzymes and the duration of 
abnorm alities on seri al measurem ents. Underlying liver diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty  liver 
disease, diabetes, or excess alcoho l consumpt ion are imp ortant cofactors for methotrexate -induced 
liver toxicit y. However, methotrexate -associated advanced liver fibrosis is rarely seen in pat ients 
with IBD or rheum atoid arthri tis. Other GI com plaints including stomat itis and diarrhea are less 
commo n. The terat ogeni c effects of methotrexate are well established.

immuno modulators, and mesalamine. In 2010, the SONIC trial demo nstrated that combinat ion 
therapy  with the TNF antagonist infliximab and immuno modulator azathi oprine further 
significant ly improved treatment efficacy  [30]. About 40% of pati ents, however, will not achieve 
remis sion after ini tiation of  a combined TNF antagonist and immuno modulator [30]. This raises 
the question as to whether we can improve remission rates and modify disease progression by 
adding a third agent, vedolizumab, with a different mechanism o f action to TNF antagonists, to the 
combinat ion regimen, particularly  for pati ents who are at higher risk for CD complicat ions. 
Vedolizumab is an α4β7 anti-integrin, approved in the United States in 2014 to treat both moderate 
to severe CD and UC and in Canada in 2015 to treat UC, after demo nstrating efficacy and safet y in 
the GEMINI studies [12,31,32] . Subjects who have failed TNF -antagonist therapy  have been 
shown to have higher levels of tissue MAdCAM and lower levels of circulat ing α4β7 -positive cells. 
Subjects who responded to therapy  with infliximab or adalimumab have been shown to have a 
decrease in MAdCAM and an increase in α4β7 -positive cells [33]. Thi s suggests that the 
vedo lizumab pathway is act ive and that vedolizumab may wo rk well as part of a combinat ion 
therapy  regimen. Combining bio logic therapi es wi th alternate m echanisms of act ion, such as the 
anti-integrin vedo lizumab and the TNF antagonist adalimumab, may provide clinically relevant 
synergy .
There i s growing evidence that mucosal  healing is an important outcome in CD treatment. 
Rutgeerts et al. demonstrated this in the postoperative setting showing that CD patients with 
endoscopi c evi dence of act ive disease were more likely to have a clinical recurrence in the 
following 4 to 8 y ears [34]. In clinical trials wit h bio logics, pati ents who have mucosal healing 
have been shown to have increased rates of steroid -free remissio n and a decreased risk of surgery  
and hospital ization [35]. In view of these findings, clinical practice is moving toward a “treat to 
target” approach, where the goals o f treatm ent go bey ond controlling symptom s and instead aim 
for improving object ive measures such as mucosal healing and deep remissio n [36].
Further subgroup analyses in CD bio logic clinic al trials have demonstrated higher response rates 
in patients who are treated earlier in the course of their disease (less than 1 or 2 y ears fro m 
diagnosis). In a recent study , using a combinat ion of a TNF antagonist, infliximab, and 
azathioprine, clinical remissio n and full mucosal healing was observed in more than 65% of 
patients wi th early disease of less than 18 months in duration [37,38] . The REACT trial 
demonstrated that early introduction of co mbinat ion therapy  with adalimumab and an 
immuno modulator decreased the chance o f hospi talizati ons, com plicati ons, and surgeries at 
2years compared to convent ional therapy [39]. 
Importantly, our understanding o f which pat ients with CD are at hi gher risk for an aggressive 
disease course has improved, as various risk factors are identifi ed and predi ctive tools have been 
developed [6,40]. Invo lvement of the upper GI tract and ileum, penetrating dise ase, early  age at 
diagnosis, sm oking, extensive ulceration of the mucosa, high titers of serum antibodies, and 
mutati ons of the NOD2 gene all have been determined to be markers of aggressive CD [3].This can 
allow for targeting of earlier co mbinat ion therapy  forthose at hi ghest risk. 
The hypothesis of this study  is that triple combinati on therapy  with 2biologics wi th different 
mechanisms of action (the anti- integrin vedo lizumab IV and the TNF antagonist adalimumab SC) Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Useents, however, will not achieve

better outcomes of steroid- free remissio n and decreased risk of surgery  and hospi talizati on. 
Com plete mucosal healing, however, is only achieved by a minorit y of subjects in clinical pract ice 
and trials. The Crohn’s Disease Endoscopic Index of Severit y(CDEIS) and the SES -CD are robust, 
validated, endoscopic indices that show high reproducibilit y among central  readers [41]. The 
absence of validated score thresho lds associated wit h specific prognostic values or with 
endosc opic healing, however, represents a weakness of both the CDEIS and the SES- CD. While 
most thresho lds for remissio n in trials have been chosen arbitrarily by investigators, specialists in 
the field of IBD recently agreed on a SES- CD of 0 –2 for the definit ion of endoscopi c remissio n. 
Endoscopic response as a >50% decrease in SES-CD was also proposed [41].
There are different treatment agents and combinat ions used currently in clinical pract ice to achieve 
the goal  of endoscopi cand clinical remissio n. Combinat ion therapy  for CD appears to l ead to 
significant ly improved efficacy; however, many subjects treated with combined TNF- antagoni st 
and immuno modulator therapy  do not achi eve mucosal  healing [30]. Vedolizumab has a unique, 
gut-select ive, immunomodul atory  mechanism  of action that provides the basis for its development 
as a treatm ent for CD. In a pivotal phase 3 clinical trial, vedolizumab IV was effective for 
induct ion and m aintenance therapy  in subjects with CD [12]. The goal of adding vedo lizumab, 
which has a different mechanism of act ion, to a TNF antagonist and immuno modulator, is to safely 
and effectively improve remission rates in CD patients. Coadministration of the 2 biologics 
infliximab and natalizumab was previous ly studi ed for 10 weeks in 52 CD subjects and was well 
tolerated wi thout increased adverse events compared to infliximab mo notherapy  [42].
The primary  endpoint evaluated in this study  will be endo scopic remission at Week 26. Based on 
a post hoc analysis of the SONIC trial, 26 weeks is the minimum t ime for the m ajority of patients 
to achieve deep remissio n wit h combinat ion therapy [43]. CD patients treated early in their course 
of disease wi th combinat ion therapy  have reduced chances of hospitalizat ion, com plicat ions, and 
surgeri es [39]. 
Our understanding o f which pat ients with CD are at hi gher risk for aggressive disease course has 
improved. A number of clinical factors have been ident ified that predict CD progression including 
disease l ocati on, y oung age at di agnosis, di sease behavior, peri anal disease, use of steroi ds at 
diagnosis, and smoking. Some serological tests, such as ant ibodies against Saccaromyces 
cerevisae and genet ic markers, have also been used in an effort to improve risk stratificat ion. In 
2014, th e AGA published CD Clinical Care Pathway, which includes pat ient stratificat ion 
according to their disease burden ( Appendix E) [5]. Using this care pathway , pati ents are 
considered being at moderate -high r isk for CD complicat ions due to disease progression if they are 
<30 y ears of age at init ial diagnosis, have extensive anatomic involvement, have perianal and/or 
severe rectal diseas e, have deep ulcers, or have had prior surgical resect ion and structuring and/or 
penetrating behavior. Siegel et al. created a web-based tool, the PROSPECT CD Risk Calculator, 
which has been used to predict outcomes and response to treatment for individual s [4,6]. This tool 
has been validated in pediatric and adult patients with CD. About 20% of patients with CD have an 
indolent course of disease from the time o f diagnosis and are considered low risk for disease 
complicat ions. Only subjects with suspected aggressive CD at increased risk for disease 
complicat ions will be enrolled in the stu dy.Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Userobust,

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 0 4 30 June 2020
As CD i s a progressive disease with lo ng-term structural  com plicati ons, the proposed duration of 
this study  is 102 weeks, in order to provide lo ng-term efficacy  data of  vedolizumab m aintenance 
therapy  following tri ple combinat ion induct ion therapy . Secondary  endpoints will include 
achieving and maintaining clinical remission and maintaining endoscopic remissio n, and 
additional endpoints will include PROs and AEs. All subjects will receive vedo lizumab IV 300 mg 
on Day  1, Weeks 2 and 6, and Q8W thereafter until Week 102; adalimumab 160 mg SC on Day 2, 
80 mg SC at Week 2, and 40 mg SC ever y 2weeks thereafter until Week 26; and oral methotrexate 
15mg weekly unt il Week 34. The init ial dosing recommendat ions in the dosing regimen for both 
vedo lizumab IV and adalimumab SC follow the approved labels [14,44] .
If a subject has an exacerbat ion of CD after 26 weeks, defined as a CDAI increase of >70 from the 
prior visit on 2 occasi ons separated by  a 2-week interval, with objec tive evidence of disease 
activit y by co lonoscopy  AND elevated CRP, OR fecal calprotectin >250 μg/g alone, then 
frequency  of vedolizumab infusio ns will be changed to vedolizumab 300 mg IV Q4W, instead of 
vedo lizumab 300 mg IV Q8W for the remainder treatment . Clinical remission and response rates 
increased in pat ients who lost response to Entyvio Q8W in GEMINI I and II when Ent yvio dosing 
frequency  was increased to Q4W in GEMINI long- term safet y (LTS) study [45]. In CD, increased 
dosing frequency  from every  8 weeks (GEMINI II) to every  4 weeks (GEMINI LTS) improved 
outcom es in patients who h ad wi thdrawn early  from GEMINI II, wi th 47% experi encing clinical 
response and 32% in remissio n at Week 52 of GE MINI LTS, up fro m 39% and 4% before the dose 
increase. Analysis o f real worl d data has similarly  dem onstrated that administration Q4W may 
help c apture response in subjects who have lost response with dosing Q8W [46]. 
6.3 Premature Termination or Suspension of Study or Investigational Site
6.3.1 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of the Study
The study  will be co mpleted as planned unless 1 or more of the fo llowing criteria are satisfied that

7.4 Criteria for Discontinuation or Withdrawal of a Subject
The primary  reason for di scont inuat ion or wi thdrawal  of the subject from the study  or study 
medicat ion shoul d be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) using the fo llowing 
categori es. For screen failure subjects, refer to Section  9.1.29 .
1. Pretreatment event (PTE) or AE. The subject has experienced a PTE or AE that requires early 
termination because cont inued participat ion imposes an unacceptable risk to the subject’s 
healt h or the subject is unwilling to continue because of the PTE or AE.
LFT Abnormalit ies
Study  medicati on shoul d be discont inued immediately with appropriate clinical fo llow-up 
(including repeat laboratory  tests, until a subject’s laboratory profile has returned to 
norm al/baseline status, see Section 9.1.20 ), if the foll owing ci rcumstances occur at any  
time during study  medicati on treatm ent:
–ALT or AST >8 × ULN, or
– ALT or AST >5 × ULN and persists for more than 2 weeks, or
–ALT or AST >3 × ULN in conjunct ion with elevated total bili rubin >2 × ULN or 
internat ional norm alize d rati o (INR) >1.5, or
– ALT or AST >3 × ULN with appearance of fat igue, nausea, vo miting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%).
Leukopenia or Lymphopenia. WBC and lymphocyte counts will be monitored for all 
subject s. Methotrexate, if applicable, should be discontinued and the dose of study drug 
held for an abso lute lymphocyte count <0.5 × 109/L at any point in the study. The abso lute 
lymphocy te count m ust be repeated at appropriate intervals as determined by the 
investigator. The next dose of study drug can be administered only if the absolute 
lymphocy te count is ≥0.5 × 109/L. If the abso lute lymphocyte count remains <0.5 × 109/L, 
study  drug shoul d be discont inued and the subject withdrawn from the study.
2. Subjects wh o requi re surgi cal intervent ion for the treatment of CD except for seton placement 
for peri anal fistul a without abscess.
3.Significant protocol  deviat ion. The discovery postenrollment that the subject failed to meet 
protocol  entry  criteria or di d not adhere to protocol requirements, and/or continued 
participat ion poses an unacceptable risk to the subject’s healt h.
4.Lost to follow -up. The subject did not return to the clinic and attempts to contact the subject 
were unsuccessful. Attempts to contact the subject must be documented.
5.Voluntary  withdrawal. The subject (or subject’s legally  acceptable representative) wishes to 
withdraw from  the study . The reason for withdrawal, if provided, should be recorded in the 
eCRF.Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of UsePretreatment event (PTE) or AE. The subject has experienced a PTE or AE that requires early

8.3 Accountability and Destruction of Sponsor-Supplied Drugs
The invest igator and invest igator’s designated site pharmacy must ensure that the sponsor- or 
contract research organizat ion (CRO) -supplied drug is used in accordance with the protocol and is 
dispensed only  to subjects enrolled in the study . To docum ent appropri ate use of the 
sponsor-supplied drugs (vedolizumab IV, adalimumab prefilled syringes, an d methotrexate 
tablets), the invest igator pharmacy/site must maint ain records of drug delivery  to the si te, si te 
inventory , dispensation and use by  each subject, and return to the sponsor or designee. The use of 
the CRO- supplied supplement (fo lic acid) mus t be docum ented in the subject's medical record. 
Upon recei pt of sponsor -supplied drug, the designated site pharmacy must verify the contents of 
the shipments against the packing list. The verifier should ensure that the quant ity is correct, and 
the medic ation is in good condit ion. If quantit y and condi tions are acceptable, designated site 
pharmacy should acknowledge the receipt of the shipment by  signing bottom  half of the packing 
list and by recording in IRT. If there are any  discrepancies between the pa cking list versus the 
actual product received, Takeda must be contacted to resolve the issue. The packing list should be 
filed in the investigator’s essent ial document file.
The invest igator’s designated site pharmacy must maintain 100% accountabilit y for all 
sponsor- supplied drugs received and dispensed during his or her ent ire parti cipat ion in the study. 
Proper drug accountabilit y includes, but is not limited to:
Moni toring expirat ion dates (monitored via IRT).
Frequent ly verifying that actual inventory  matches docum ented inventory .
Verifying that the drug accoun tabilit y log is completed for the Med ID used to prepare each 
dose.
Verifying that all containers used are documented accurately on the log.
Verifying that required fields are co mpleted accurately and l egibly .
If any dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered, the sponsor must be notified immediately.
The IRT will include all required informat ion as a separate entry  for each subject to whom 
sponsor- supplied drug is dispensed.
The invest igator ’s designated site pharmacy must record the current inventory  of all the 
sponsor- supplied drugs (vedo lizumab IV, adalimumab prefilled syringes, and m ethotrexate tablets)

Addit ional information and tools for the RAMP can be found in the Reference Binder.
9.1.8 Documentation of Concurrent Medical Conditions
Concurrent medical condit ions are those significant ongoing condit ions or disea ses that are present 
at signing of informed consent. This includes clinically significant laboratory , electrocardi ogram  
(ECG), or physical examinat ion abnormalit ies noted at the screening or baseline examinat ion. The 
condi tion (ie, di agnosis) should be described.
9.1.9 ECG Procedure 
A standard 12-lead ECG will be recorded. The investigator (or a qualified observer at the 
investigat ional site) will interpret the ECG using one of the fo llowing categori es: wi thin norm al 
limits, abnormal but not clinically significa nt, or abnormal and clinically significant. A copy of the 
ECG trace should be kept with the subject’s notes.
9.1.10 Predicting CD Disease Course

9.1.10.3 PROSPECT CD Tool 
The PROSPECT CD Risk Calculator is a web -based tool used to predict out comes and response to 
treatm ent [4,6]. For subjects who m the invest igator chooses to implement the PROSPECT tool, 
their blood will be drawn at the time of informed consent and shipped to Prometheus Labs, San 
Diego, CA (or other lab) for serologic and genet ic markers. If an invest igator chooses not to utilize 
the PROSPECT tool to assess a subject’s risk of developing CD co mplicati ons, blood may still be 
collected for serologic and genet ic markers for the endpo int analysis o f PROSPECT tool 
perform ance at any  time during the subject’s screening period. Further instruction on the 
collect ion and handling of these samples can be found in the study Laboratory Manual. The results 
of these tests will be used as inputs to the PROSPECT predict ive tool. This mathemat ical 
predi ction tool incorporates basic disease characterist ics including disease locat ion and t ime since 
diagnosis, in addit ion to serologic markers such as ant i-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody  
(ASCA), CBir, perinuclear antineutrophil antibody (pANCA), and a single genet ic polymorphism 
of NOD2. The results of the serologic and genet ic markers will be sent to the PROSPECT 
coordinator who will input the results to create an output graphical representation of that 
individual’s risk wit h ≥20% chance of disease complicat ion by Year 2. These results will be then 
sent to the site invest igator to be considered as part of the investigator’s assessment of a subject’s 
risk of CD co mplications.

9.1.11 Colonoscopy and Biopsy Procedure
Colonoscopy  will be performed during screening and at Weeks 26 and 102 or early terminat ion. 
All study  colonoscopi es will  be video -recorded using the Robarts Central Image Management 
Solution (CIMS). All study endoscopy videos will be subject to central re view to ensure consistent 
grading. A central reviewer will confirm the SES- CD inclusio n criterion pri or to subj ect 
enrollment. Central reviewer’s grading will stand as final assessment for eligibilit y. CIMS will 
communicate incidental findings observed dur ing central review to the invest igator/study  team for 
additional follow up.
At each colonoscopy , up to 4 biopsies for histopatho logy will be collected from 5 segments (for a 
total of up to 20 biopsies): the rectum, left colon, transverse co lon, right colo n, and ileum. Biopsies 
will be taken in the vicinit y of the m ost prominent ul cerat ive lesio ns, if present. If there is more 
than 1 area of inflammat ion within a segment, 2 biopsies should be taken fro m the most severely 
affected area of inflammation and 2 biopsies should be taken fro m the normal mucosa adjacent to 
this area of inflammat ion. For each colonic segment, biopsies from inflamed and normal mucosa
shoul d be placed in separate specimen containers. In those instances in which the mucosa of an 
entire segment appears normal, 2 biopsies should be taken fro m norm al mucosa. Addit ionally , if 
the mucosa of an entire segment is inflamed, 2 biopsies should be obtained fro m the most severely 
affected area of inflammat ion.
The site of the biopsy co llection will be recorded. Work Instructions will detail the requirements 
for study  colonoscopy  and bi opsy . Subject preparati on for colonoscopy  shoul d follow the si te’s 
usual clinical practice (such as polyethylene glycol). 
All biopsies collected per protocol will be centrally  stored and analyzed at the end of the study . 
Although it i s permissible for the investigator to take addit ional biopsy samples as deemed 
necessary  for standard of care management of the patient during the protocol -requi red 
colonoscopy , these will be considered as occurring outside the protocol. Such collect ion, handling, 
and analyses of the addit ional samples will be and remain the responsibility of the invest igator. Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Usen.

9.1.12 Primary Efficacy Measurement
The primary  efficacy  measure is the percentage of su bjects who achieve endoscopic remissio n, 
defined as SES-CD 0- 2 at Week 26.
9.1.13 The SES- CD
The SES -CD [48] evaluates 4 endoscopic variables (u lcer size, proportion of the surface area that 
is ulcerated, proportion of the surface area affected, and stenosis) by scoring each variable on a 
scale fro m 0 to 3 where higher scores indicate more severe diseas e, in 5 bowel  segments (ileum, 
right colon, t ransverse colon, left colon, and rectum). 
The score for each endoscopic variable is the sum of the values obtained for each segment. The 
SES-CD Total is the sum o f the 4 endoscopic variable scores from 0 to 56. See Appendix F.
9.1.14 CDAI
A CDAI [49] score will be calculated at baseline Week 0, using subject diary entries during 
screening within 14 days prior to enrollment, and is based on the most recent 7 days wit h complete 
and valid data within a maximum consecut ive 10 day period. Note that diary entries on the day 
prior, day  of, and the day  after the col onoscopy  cannot be used for CDAI sub -score cal culat ion. 
For the baseline CDAI the hematoc rit resul ts collected during screening should be used. A CDAI 
score will also be derived at the time po ints specified in the Schedule of Events and at any 
unscheduled visit(s) due to disease exacerbat ion. See Appendix G. A Standard Weight Table is 
provi ded in Appendix H.
9.1.15 CDAI Diary Completion
Diary entries will  be m ade daily  by subjects and will be used for CDAI score calculat ion. During 
screening, subjects will be instructed on how to appropriately co mplete the daily diary. The 
symptoms of CD must be recorded throughout the study, including the scre ening peri od. En tries 
shoul d be reviewed and mo nitored by  the study  staff.
9.1.16 PRO -2
A 2-item patient-reported outcome, PRO -2, will be derived fro m 2 elements of the CDAI di ary 
(stool  frequency and abdominal pain) from the 7 days prior to score calculation [ 50]. See 
Appendix I. 
9.1.17 Additional Patient -Reported Outcome Measures
Subjects will co mplete the IBDQ, WPAI -CD, and the IBD- DI at the time points specified in the

9.1.17.2 Work Productivity and Activity Impairment - Crohn’s Disease
The WPAI -CD consists of 6 questions that evaluate absenteeism (wo rk time missed), presenteeism 
(reduced work productivit y), overall work impairment, and activit y impairment [54,55] . The 
WPAI-CD quest ionnaire will be self -administered by  the study  subjects. 
9.1.17.3 Inflammatory Bow el Disease -Disability Index
The IBD- DI is the first specific instrument for evaluating disabilit y in IBD. It i s based on core 
sections of the World Healt h Organizat ion’s International Classification o f Functioning, Disabilit y, 
and Healt h and was designed to evaluate the long -term effects of IBD on subject functional status 
and to provi de a new endpo int in disease -modificatio n studi es [56]. The IBD -DI consists of 14 
questions that focus on body  functions, bod y structures, activit ies and part icipation, and 
environmental factors. Scores range between 0 to 100, with 0 to 20 indicat ing no disabilit y, 
20to35 mild disabilit y, 35to50 moderate disabilit y, and 50 to100 severe disabilit y. The IBD -DI 
recent ly has be en validated for use in clinical trials, including results from 150 subjects with CD, 
having shown high internal consistency, interobserver reliabilit y, and construct validit y, as well as 
moderate intraobserver reliabilit y [57].
9.1.18 Documentation of Concomitant Procedures
At each visit, subjects will be asked whether they  have had any  CD-related events since their last 
visit including hospitalizations, bowel surgeries, or CD-related procedures that are not part of the 
protocol . The timing o f the event will be collected relative to the start of treatment on Day 1 of the 
study  through the last clinic visit (Week 120). All events with timing will be recorded in the eCRFs. 
The underlying symptom or diagnosis should correspondingly be recorded as an AE as applicable.
9.1.19 Documentation of Concomitant Medications
Concomitant medicat ion is any drug given in addit ion to the required s tudy medicati on 
(methotrexate, vedolizumab, adalimumab, or the companio n folat e). These may be prescribed by a 
physician or obtained by the subject over the coun ter. Concomitant medicat ion is not provi ded by 
Takeda. At each study  visit, subjects will be as ked whether they  have taken any  medicati on other 
than the study -specified medicat ion (used fro m signing of informed consent through the end o f the 
study ), and all  medicat ion including vitamin supplements, over- the-counter medications, and oral 
herbal prepa rations, m ust be recorded in the eCRF. Concomitant medication informat ion will be

9.1.25 Pharmacogenomic Sampli ng
When sampling of who le blood for PGx analysis occurs, every subject must sign informed 
consent/be consented in order to participate in the study . 
Two whole blood samples (3 mL per sample) for DNA iso lation will be co llected before dosing on 
Day 1 from  each subject in the study , into pl astic K2EDTA spray -coated tubes, and stored under 
frozen condit ions. If necessary and feasible, a second aliquot of blood may be taken if iso lation of 
DNA fro m the first sam ple was not successful or possible.
Two whole blo od RNA samples (2.5 mL per sample) for RNA PGx analysis will be co llected on 
Day 1 from  each subject in the study , into a PaxGeneTM tube. If DNA or RNA samples are not 
obtained on Day  1, they  may be collected at any  point in the study . Please refer to the Reference 
Binder for information on sample co llection and preparation.
DNA form s the basis for the genes that make the body  produce proteins such as enzymes, drug 
transporters, or drug targets. RNA has mult iple vital roles in the codes, decoding, regulat ion, 
expressio n of genes and sensing and co mmunicat ing responses to cellular signals. Both DNA and 
RNA from t issues such as blood may be evaluated for the genet ic contribut ion of how the drug is 
broken down, or how the drug affects the body . This is called a “Pharmacogeno mics research 
study .” Specific purposes of this study  include:
Identifying genet ic reasons why certain people respond differently to vedolizumab.
Finding out more informat ion about how vedolizumab works. 
Generat ing informat ion needed for res earch, development, and regulatory  approval  of tests to 
predi ct response to vedolizumab.
Ident ifying variations in genes related to the bio logical target of vedo lizumab.
This information may be used, for example, to develop a better understanding of the sa fety and 
efficacy  of vedo lizumab and other study medicat ions, and for improving the efficiency, design and 
study  methods of future research studies.
The samples will be stored for no longer than 15 years after complet ion of the study . No sam ples 
will be st ored for longer than permitted by the applicable law and samples will be destroyed upon 
notification fro m Takeda. “Stored samples” are defined as samples that are key- coded (the 
samples are stripped of all personal ident ifying information but a key  links t he samples to the 
clinical data collected from the sample donor) and are used in the analysis o f invest igational drug 
or rel ated drugs.Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Useve samples using a validated assay. nADAs to adalimumab will only be determined if

The follow ing definitions apply for contraception and pregnancy avoidance procedures.
*A wo man is considered a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP), ie, fert ile, following 
menarche and unt ilbeco ming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization 
methods include hysterectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy . A postm enopausal  state i s defined as 
no menses for 12 months without an alternat ive medical cause. A high fo llicle -stimul ating 
horm one (FSH) level  in the postm enopausal  range (FSH >40 IU/L) may  be used to confirm a 
postm enopausal state in y ounger women (eg, those <45 y ears ol d) or wom en who are not using 
horm onal contraception or horm onal replacement therapy. However, in the absence o f 12 months 
of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.

9.4 Biological Sample Retention and Destruction
In this study, specimens for genome/gene analysis will be coll ected as described in Section 9.1.25 .
The genetic material will be preserved and retained for up to but not longer than 15 years or as 
requi red by applicable law. The sponsor has put into place a system to protect the subjects’ 
personal informat ion to ensure optimal confident iality and defined standard processes for sample 
and data collect ion, storage, analysis, and destruction.
The samples will be s ent to a central  laboratory  that processes the blood sample and serves as a 
secure storage facilit y. The sponsor and researchers working with the sponsor will have access to 
the sam ples collected and any  test resul ts. All  sampl es collected during the study will be stored 
securely  with limited access and the sponsor will require any one who works wi th the sam ples to 
agree to hold the research informat ion and any results in confidence.
The sample will be labeled with a unique sample ident ifier similar to label ing in the main study but 
using a code that is different from the code attached to the health information and other clinical test 
resul ts collected in the study . The sample and data are linked to personal health informat ion with 
code numbers. This link means that the subject may be identified but only indirect ly. The code 
numbers will be kept secure by  or on behalf of the sponsor.
Subjects who consented and provided PGx samples can wit hdraw their consent and request 
disposal  of a stored sam ple at any  time. Notify  sponsor of consent wi thdrawal .

10.0 PRETREATMENT EVENTS, ADVERSE EVENTS, AND PRODUCT 
COMPLAINTS
10.1 Definitions
10.1.1 PTEs
A PTE i s defined as any  untoward m edical  occurrence in a clinical invest igation subject who has 
signed inform ed consent to participate in a study  but pri or to administration of any study  
medicat ion; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relat ionship with study  parti cipat ion.
10.1.2 AEs
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical invest igation subject 
administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relat ionship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a drug whether or 
not it is considered related to the drug.
10.1.3 PCs
A product complaint (PC) is a verbal, written, or electro nic expressio n that implies dissat isfaction 
regarding the identit y, strength, puri ty, quali ty, or s tabilit y of a drug product and/or device 
(eg,prefilled syringe).
An invest igator who is made aware of or ident ifies a potential PC should immediately report the 
event to Takeda in accordance with the contact list provided to the site. Whenever possible, the 
associ ated product should be maintained in accordance with the instructions pending further 
guidance fro m a Takeda representative.
10.1.4 Additional Points to Co nsider for PTEs and AEs
An untoward finding generally may:
Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre- exist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for pre -exist ing condit ions underlying disease should not be considered PTEs or AEs.)
Necessitate therapeuti c intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure.
Requi re discontinuation or a change in dose of study medicat ion or a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by the invest igator for any reason.
PTEs/AEs caused by a study proced ure (eg, a bruise after blood draw) should be recorded as a 
PTE/AE.Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Usen subject who has

Diagnoses versus signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms sh ould NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If a di agnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded 
appropriately as a PTE(s) or as an AE(s).
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory values or ECG paramete rs are only considered to be PTEs or AEs if the y 
are judged to be clinically significant (ie, if some action or intervent ion is required or if the 
investigator judges the change to be bey ond the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). A 
laboratory  retest and/or continued monitori ng of an abnormal value are not considered an 
intervent ion. In addit ion, repeated or addit ional noninvasive testing for verificat ion, evaluatio n 
or monitoring of an abnormalit y is not considered an intervent ion.
If abnormal laboratory values or ECG finding s are the result of pathology for which there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as a PTE or as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
Pre-exist ing condit ions (present at the ti me o f signing of informed consent) are considered 
concurrent medical condit ions and should NOT be recorded as PTEs or AEs. Baseline 
evaluat ions (eg, l aboratory tests, ECG, X -rays etc.) should NOT be recorded as PTEs unless 
related to study procedures. Howe ver, if the subject experiences a worsening or complication 
of such a concurrent condit ion, the worsening or complicat ion shoul d be recorded 
appropriately  as a PTE (worsening or complicat ion occurs before start of study medicat ion) or 
an AE (worsening or c omplicat ion occurs after start of study medicat ion). Investigators should 
ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).
If a subject has a pre- exist ing episodic condit ion (eg, asthma, epilepsy) any occurrence of an 
episode should only be captured as a PTE/AE if the episodes beco me mo re frequent, serious or 
severe in nature, that is, invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the 
change in the condit ion from Baseline (eg, “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurrent condition (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis), 
worsening of the condit ion shoul d only  be captured as a PTE/AE if occurring to a greater 
extent to that which would be expected. Again, investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of PTEs or AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complicatio n of a PTE after starting administration of 
the study  medicat ion, the worsening or complic ation should be recorded appropriately as an 
AE. Invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion 
(eg, “worsening of…”).Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Usempanying signs (including

If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any  change in study
medicat ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators 
shoul d ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).
Changes in severit y of AEs /Seri ous PTEs:
If the subject experiences changes in severit y of an AE/seri ous PTE, the event should be 
captured once with the maximum severit y recorded.
Prepl anned surgeries or procedures:
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapies) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
informed consent are not considered PTEs or AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is 
perform ed early  (eg, as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre -exist ing condit ion, the 
worsening of the condit ion should be captured appropriately as a PTE or an AE. Complicat ions 
resulting fro m any planned surgery  shoul d be reported as AEs.
Elect ive surgeries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as PTEs or AEs, but should be documented in the sub ject’s source 
docum ents. Com plicat ions result ing from an elect ive surgery should be reported as AEs.
Insufficient clinical response (lack of efficacy):
Insufficient clinical response, efficacy, or pharmacologic act ion, should NOT be recorded as 
an AE. The invest igator must make the dist inction bet ween exacerbation o f pre-exist ing illness 
and lack of therapeutic efficacy.
Overdose:
Cases of overdose with any  medicati on wi thout m anifested si de effects are NOT considered 
PTEs or AEs, but instead will be docume nted on an Overdose page of the eCRF. Any 
manifested side effects will be considered PTEs or AEs and will be recorded on the AE page of 
the eCRF.
10.1.5 SAEs
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
1.Results in DEATH.
2.Is LIFE THREATENING.
The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were m ore severe.
3.Requi res inpat ient HOSPITALIZATION or prolongation of exist ing hospitalizat ion.

10.1.6 Special Interest AEs
An AESI (serious or nonserious) is an AE of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
compound or program , for whi ch ongoing mo nitoring and rapid communicat ion by the 
investigator to Takeda may be appropriate. Such events may require further invest igation in order 
to characterize and understand them and would be described in protocols and instructions provided 
for invest igators as to how and when they should be reported to Takeda.
AESIs for vedolizumab are serious infect ions including opportunist ic infection such as PML, liver 
injury , malignancies, infusio n-related or sy stemic reactions, and hypersensit ivity, as described in 
further detail below.
Inject ion and/or Infusio n Site Reacti ons and Hy persensi tivity
Current ly, there is no evidence to support the routine prophylactic administration of premedicat ion 
(eg, antihistamines, corticosteroids) to subjects receiving vedo lizumab; hence, such 
prem edicat ions are unlikely to be necessary or beneficial. At the discret ion of the invest igator, Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Use Significant AE List

however, subjects may  be administered premedicatio n prior to any  study  drug administrati on. 
Corti costeroi ds, if given as a premedicat ion, should be limited to the day  of administration. 
Study  drugs shoul d be administered by  a he alth care practi tioner prepared to manage 
hypersensit ivity react ions including anaphylaxis, if they occur. Appropriate monitoring and 
medical support measure should be available for immediate use. Subjects should be observed for 
2hours following the first 2infusions, at a minimum, and 1 hour after each subsequent infusio n of 
vedo lizumab.
Subjects and caregivers will be instructed to report the development of rash, hives, pruritus, 
flushing, urticaria, injection site pain, redness, and/or swelling, etc. th at may represent an 
administration- related reaction (ie, infusio n-related reaction) to study medicat ion. Subjects will be 
asked to report administration- related AEs to the sites immediately  as they  are experienced. 
Appropriate treatment and follow -up will be determined by the investigator. If signs or symptoms 
of an administration -related reaction are observed during the administration of study medicat ion, it 
shoul d be immediately discontinued and the subject treated as medically appropriate. In the case of
a mild reaction, study drug administration may be reinit iated (with appropriate premedication and 
investigator supervisio n) at the discretion o f the investigator. Subjects with a severe or serious 
administration- related reacti on (eg, shortness of breath, wheezing, stridor, angioedema, 
life-threatening change in vital signs, severe injection site reactions) must be withdrawn fro m the 
study . 
In all cases of administration- related reacti on, the medical mo nitor must be informed as soon as 
practi cal. The dispo sition of  subjects wi th less severe administration- related reacti ons shoul d be 
discussed wi th the m edical m onitor.
Serious Infect ions 
Subjects will be mo nitored for si gns and symptoms of infect ion and for changes in WBC, 
hemoglo bin, and platelets during t he study . Subj ects wi th signs and symptoms suggest ive of 
infect ions, including GI infections, will be treated as clinically indicated. In tervent ions m ay 
include ant ibiotic treatment, if appropriate and/or discontinuat ion of conco mitant 
immuno modulators. Bl ood, sputum , urine, and/or stool cultures should be obtained as appropriate 
for the detection and diagnosis of infection. Withholding or terminating study drug administratio n 
may be considered as described in Sect ion 7.3.1.2 .
Malignancies
All cases of malignancies that are detected during the study will be reported as AEs. Local medica l 
practi ces for the management of malignances will apply. Subjects with history of malignancy 
(except for specific cancers) or at high risk for malignancy will be excluded from the study per the 
exclusio n criteria.

10.1.7 Severity of PTEs and AEs
Thedifferent categories o f intensit y (severit y) are characterized as follows:
Mild: The event is transient and easily tolerated by the subject.
Moderate: The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual activities.
Severe: The eve nt causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities.
10.1.8 Causality of AEs
The rel ationship of each AE to study  medicati on(s) will be assessed using the fo llowing 
categories:
Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug (including the 
course after withdrawal of the drug), or for which possible involvement of the drug cannot be 
ruled out , although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments, may also be responsible.
Not Related: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug and/o r 
that can reasonably be explained by other factors, such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments.
10.1.9 Relationship to Study Procedures
Relationship (causalit y) to study  procedures should be determined for all PTEs and AEs.
The relationship should be assessed as Relate d if the investigator considers that there is reasonable 
possibilit y that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed 
as Not Related. 
10.1.10 Start Date
The start date of the AE/PTE is the date that the first signs/symptoms were noted by  the subject 
and/or physician, and the time, if available.
10.1.11 Stop Date 
The stop date of the AE/PTE is the date at which the subject recovered, the event resolved but with 
sequelae or the subject died, and the time, if available.
10.1.12 Frequency 
Episodi c AEs/PTE (eg, vomit ing) or those which occur repeatedly over a period of consecutive 
days are intermittent. All other events are continuous.
10.1.13 Action Concerning Study Medication 
Drug withdrawn –a study  medicat ion is stopped due to the pa rticular AE.
Dose not changed –the particular AE did not require stopping a study  medicat ion.
Unknown –only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has been taken.Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Useon(s) will be assessed using the fo

Dose Interrupted –the dose was interrupted due to the particular AE.
10.1.14 Outcome
Recovered/Resolved – Subject returned to first assessment status with respect to the AE/PTE.
Recovering/Reso lving –the intensit y is lowered by  1 or m ore stages: the diagnosis or 
signs/symptom s has almost di sappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved, but has not 
returned to the norm al range or to Baseline; the subject died from a cause other than the 
particular AE/PTE with the condit ion rem aining “recovering/reso lving.”
Not recovered/not resolved –there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the diagnosis, signs/symptoms or laboratory  value on the l ast day  of the observed 
study  period has got worse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital anomaly; the 
subject died fro m another cause with the particular AE/PTE state remaining “Not 
recovered/not resolved.”
Reso lved with sequelae –the subject recovered from an acute AE/PTE but was left with 
perm anent/si gnificant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis).
Fatal  –the AEs/PTEs which are con sidered as the cause of death. 
Unknown –the course of the AE/PTE cannot be followed up due to hospital change or

serious PTE must be monitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in 
laboratory  values have returned to Baseline or there is a sat isfactory  explanati on for the change. 
Nonserious PTEs, related or unrelated to the study procedure, need not to be fo llowed up for the 
purposes of the protocol.
All subjects experiencing AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the study medicat ion 
or not, m ust be m onitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically  relevant changes in 
laborator y values have returned to baseline or until there is a sat isfactory  explanat ion for the 
changes observed. All PTEs and AEs will be documented in the PTE/AE page of the eCRF, 
whether or not the invest igator concludes that the event is related to the drug tr eatment. The 
following informat ion will be documented for each event:
1.Event term .
2. Start and stop date, and time (if available).
3.Severit y.
4.Invest igator’s opinio n of the causal relat ionship between the event and administration of study 
medicat ion(s) (rel ated or not rel ated) (not completed for PTEs).
5.Invest igator’s opinio n of the causal relat ionship to study  procedure(s), including the details of 
the suspected procedure.
6.Action concerning study  medicat ion (not applicable for PTEs).
7.Outcom e of event.

CDAI and qualit y of life instruments will not be used as a primary means to collect AEs. However, 
shoul d the invest igator become aware of a potential AE through the informat ion collected with 
these instruments, proper follow -up with the subject for medi cal eval uation shoul d be undertaken. 
Through this fo llow-up if it is determined that an AE not previously  reported has been i dentified, 
norm al reporting requi rements shoul d be applied.
10.2.1.3 Special Interest AE Reporting
If an AESI , whi ch occurs during the treatment period or the fo llow-up peri od, is considered to be 
clinically significant based on the criteria in Sect ion 10.1.6 , it should be recor ded in a special

The special interest AEs have to be recorded as AEs in the eCRF. An evaluat ion form along wi th 
all other required documentation must be submitted to the sponsor.
10.2.2 Collection and Reporting of SAEs
When an SAE occurs throug h the AE collection period it should be reported according to the 
following procedure:
A Takeda SAE eCRF or form must be co mpleted in English and signed by the invest igator 
immediately  or wi thin 24 hours of first onset or notification o f the event. The inf ormation shoul d 
be co mpleted as fully as possible but con tain, at a minimum:
A short descript ion of the event and the reason why  the event i s categori zed as serious.
Subject identificat ion number.
Invest igator’s name.
Nam e of the study  medicat ion(s).
Causalit y assessment.
The SAE eCRF should be co mpleted wi thin 24 hours of first onset or notification o f the event. 
However, as a back-up, if required, the SAE form should be co mpleted and reported to Takeda 
Pharmacovigilance or designee within 24 hours to the attention of the contact listed in Section  1.1.
Any SAE spontaneously reported to the invest igator fo llowing the AE collect ion period should be 
reported to the sponsor if considered related to study  parti cipat ion.
Reporting of Serious PTEs will fo llow the procedure described for SAEs.
10.2.3 Reporting of Abnormal Liver Function Tests
If a subject is noted to have ALT or AST elevated >3 ×ULN on 2 conse cutive occasions, the 
abnorm ality shoul d be recorded as an AE. In addition, an LFT Increases eCRF must be co mpleted 
provi ding addit ional information on relevant recent history , risk factors, clinical signs and 
symptoms and results of any addit ional diagnos tic tests performed.
If a subject is noted to have ALT or AST >3 ×ULN and total bilirubin >2 ×ULN for which an 
alternat ive etio logy has not been i dentified, the event should be recorded as an SAE and reported 
as per Secti on 10.2.2 . The investigator must con tact the Medical Monitor for discussio n of the 
relevant subject details and possible alternative etiologies, such as acute viral hepat itis A or B o r 
other acute liver disease or medical history /concurrent m edical  condi tions. Foll ow-up laboratory  
tests as described in Sect ion 9.1.20 must also b e performed. In addi tion, an LFT Increases eCRF 
must be completed and transmitted with the Takeda SAE form (as per Section  10.2.2 ).
10.3 Follow -up of SA Es

and p rocedure for follow -up reports are the same as those for the init ial report.
10.3.1 Safety Reporting to Investigators, IRBs or IECs, and Regulatory Authorities
The sponsor will be responsible for reporting all suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions 
(SUSARs) and any other applicable SAEs to regulatory  authori ties, invest igators and IRBs or 
IECs, as applicable, in accordance with nat ional regulat ions in the countries where the study  is 
conducted. Relative to the first awareness of the event by/or further provisio n to the sponsor or 
sponsor’s designee, SUSARs will be submitted to the regulatory  authori ties as expedi ted report
within 7 days for fatal and life- threatening events and 15 days for other serious events, unless 
otherwi se requi red by  national  regulat ions. The sponsor will also prepare an expedited report for 
other safet y issues where these might materially  alter the current benefit -risk assessment of an 
investigat ional medicinal product or that would be sufficient to consider changes in the 
investigat ional medicinal products administration or in the overall conduct of the trial. The 
investigat ional site also will forward a copy  of all expedited reports to his or her IRB or IEC in 
accordance with nat ional regulat ions.
11.0 STUDY- SPECIFIC COMMITTEES
No data safet y monitoring co mmittee will be used in this study.
11.1 Adjudication Committee
A PML Independent Adjudication Co mmittee (IAC) will be inst ituted for this s tudy. The PML 
IAC will consist of a panel of leading PML experts, including a neuro logist, neuroradio logist, and 
a viro logist.
11.1.1 Risk Assessment and Minimization for PML (RAMP) Program
Natalizumab (TYSABRI), another integrin receptor antagonist, has been ass ociated wi thPML, a 
rare and often fatal opportunist ic infection o f the central  nervous system. PML is caused by  the 
John Cunningham virus (JCV) and typically only occurs in subjects who are immunocompro mised 
[58,59] . Natalizumab is a pan - α4 integrin antagonist that binds to both the α4β1 and α4β7 
integrins and inhibits cellular adhesio n to vascular cell adhesio n molecule -1 (VCAM -1) and 
MAdCAM -1 [60,61] . In contrast, vedolizumab binds to the α4β7 i ntegrin only [11]and inhibits 
adhesio n to MAdCAM -1, but not VCAM -1. Arisk of PML cannot be ruled out with vedo lizumab .
To address the theoretical risk o f the deve lopment of PML in subjects treated with vedo lizumab, 
the sponsor, with input fro m renowned PML experts, has developed a RAMP program. The 
complete descri ption of the RAMP program, including materials and instructions for its 
implementation and mo nitoring, is included in the Reference Binder.
The RAMP is focused on early  clinical detecti on and management of that specific safet y risk, 
including the discont inuat ion of study  drug, if applicable. Subjects are assessed for signs and Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of UseThe timelines

symptoms of PML prior to the a dministration of each dose of study drug using a PML subject ive 
symptom  checklist. Subj ects wi th a posi tive PML subjective symptom checklist at any  time after 
enrollment in a vedolizumab clinical study will be evaluated according to a prespecified algorith m 
(the PML Case Evaluat ion Algori thm). The next dose of study  drug will be held unt il the 
evaluat ion is co mplete and results are available. Subsequent doses of study  drug will  be 
administered only  if the possibilit y of PML is definit ively  excl uded, as desc ribed in the RAMP 
algori thm. An IAC has been established as part of the RAMP program to review new neuro logical 
signs and symptoms potentially  consistent wi th PML, and will provide input regarding subject 
evaluat ion and m anagement as defined in the IAC cha rter. 
To ensure success of the RAMP program, site personnel will be trained to recognize the features of 
PML, and subjects will be trained to report specific neurological signs and symptoms without 
delay. Educati onal materi als for teaching site personnel and subjects about PML and the RAMP 
procedures will be distributed to all sites and are included in the Reference Binder. Formal teaching and training will be performed for site personnel prior to the start of the study . Subjects 
will receive training and educat ional materi als pri or to receiving treatm ent. The informed consent 
form will contain specific informat ion on the hypothetical risk of PML. Any documented case of 
PML will be reported as an SAE, regardless of whether hospitalizat ion occurs.
12.0 DATA HANDL ING AND RECORDKEEPING
The full details of procedures for data handling will be documented in the Data Management Plan. AEs, PTEs, medical history, and concurrent condit ions will be coded using the Medical Dict ionary 
for Regul atory  Activit ies (MedDRA). Drugs will be coded using the World Health Organizat ion 
Drug Dict ionary (WHODRUG) .
12.1 eCRFs 
Com pleted eCRFs are required for each subject who signs an informed consent.
The sponsor or its designee will supply invest igative sites with access to eCRFs. The sponsor or 
delegated CRO will make arrangements to train appropriate site staff in the use of the eCRF. These 
forms are used to transmit the informat ion collected in the performance o f this study to the sponsor 
and regulatory  authori ties. eCRFs m ust be com pleted in English.
After complet ion of the entry process, computer logic checks will be run to identify items, such as 
inconsistent dates, missing data, and questionable values. Queries may be issued by Takeda 
personnel (or designees) and will be answered by the site. 
Correcti ons to eCRFs are recorded in an audit trail that captures the old information, the new 
inform ation, identificat ion of the person making the correction, the date the correction was made, 
and the reason for change.
The principal invest igator must review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy and must sign 
and date the appropriate eCRFs as indicated. Furthermore, the investigator must retain full 
responsibilit y for the accuracy and authent icity of all data entered on the eCRFs. Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Usem

13.3 Determination of Sample Size
The sample size was based on an estimate of precisio n. A sample size of 60 subjects will generate 
95% CIs for endoscopic remissio n (defined as SES-CD 0-2) rate at Week 26 with a half width no 
wider than 12.7% and expected remission o f 50%. If the expected remissio n rate i s different from 
50%, a required sample size would be smaller.
14.0 QUAL ITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
14.1 Study -Site Monitoring Visits
Moni toring visit s to the study  site will  be made peri odically  during the study  to ensure that all 
aspects of the protocol are fo llowed. Source documents will be reviewed for verificat ion of dat a 
recorded on the eCRFs. Source documents are defined as original documents, data, and records. 
The invest igator and inst itution guarantee access to source documents by  the sponsor or i ts 
designee (CRO) and by  the IRB or IEC.
All aspects of the study and i ts docum entati on will be subject to review by the sponsor or designee, 
including but not limited to the Invest igator’s Binder, study  medicat ion, subject medical records, 
inform ed consent docum entati on, docum entation of  subject authori zation to use personal healt h 
inform ation (if separate fro m the informed consent form s), and review o f eCRFs and associated 
source documents. It is important that the invest igator and other study personnel are available 
during the monitoring visits and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.
14.2 Protocol Deviations
The invest igator should not deviate fro m the protocol , except where necessary  to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to study subjects. Should other unexpected circumstances arise that will require 
deviat ion from protocol -specified procedures, the investigator should consult with the sponsor or 
designee (and IRB or IEC, as required) to determine the appropriate course of action. There will be 
no exempt ions (a prospectively approved deviat ion) from the inclusio n or exclusio n criteria.
The site should document all protocol deviat ions in the subject’s source documents. In the event of 
a significant devi ation, the si te shoul d notify the sponsor or i ts desi gnee (and IRB or EC, as 
requi red). Si gnificant devi ations include , but are not limited to, those that involve fraud or 
misconduct, increase the health risk to the subject, or confound interpretation of primary study 
assessment. A Protocol Deviation Form should be completed by the site and signed by the sponsor 
or desi gnee for any  significant deviat ion from the protocol.
14.3 Quality Assurance Audits and Regulatory Agency Inspections
The study  site also m ay be subject to qualit y assurance audi ts by  the sponsor or desi gnees. In this 
circumstance, the sponsor -designated audi tor will contact the site in advance to arrange an 
auditing visit. The auditor may ask to visit the facilit ies where laboratory samples are collected, 
where the medication is stored and prepared, and any other facilit y used during the study . In 
addition, there is the possibilit y that this study may be inspected by regulatory agencies, including

15.2 Subject Information, Informed Consent, and Subject Authorization
Written consent documents will embody  the elemen ts of inform ed consent as described in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Guidelines for GCP and will be in accordance with all 
applicable laws and regulations. The informed consent form, subject authorizat ion form (if 
applicable), and subject informa tion sheet (if applicable) describe the planned and permitted uses, 
transfers, and disclo sures of the subject’s personal and personal healt h informat ion for purposes of 
conducting the study. The informed consent form and the subject informat ion sheet (if a pplicable) 
further explain the nature of the study, its object ives, and potential risks and benefit s, as well as the 
date informed consent is given. The informed consent form will detail the requirements of the participant and the fact that he or she is fr ee to wi thdraw at any  time wi thout giving a reason and 
without prej udice to hi s or her further m edical care.
The invest igator is responsible for the preparation, content, and IRB or IEC approval of the 
informed consent form  and if applicable, the subject a uthorization form. The informed consent 
form, subject authorizat ion form (if applicable), and subject information sheet (if applicable) must 
be approved by both the IRB or IEC and the sponsor prior to use.
The informed consent form, subject authorizat ion form (if applicable), and subject informat ion

subject. Information should be given in both oral and written form whenever possible and in the 
manner deemed appropriate by the IRB or IEC. In the event the subject is not capable of rendering 
adequate written informed consent, then the subject’s legally acceptable representative may 
provi de such consent for the subject in accordance with applicable laws and regulat ions.
The subject, or the subject’s legally acce ptable representative, must be given ample opportunit y to: 
(1) inquire about details of the study and (2) decide whether or not to participate in the study. If the 
subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, determines he or she will parti cipate in 
the study , then the informed consent form and subject authorizat ion form (if applicable) m ust be 
signed and dated by  the subject, or the subject’s legally  acceptable representative, at the time of 
consent and prior to the subject entering into th e study . The subject or the subject’s legally 
acceptable representative should be instructed to sign using their legal names, not nicknames, using blue or black ballpo int ink. The invest igator must also sign and date the informed consent 
form and subject a uthorizat ion (if applicable) at th e time of consent and prior to subject entering 
into the study; however, the sponsor may  allow a designee of the invest igator to sign to the extent 
permitted by  applicable law.
Once signed, the original informed consent fo rm, subject authori zation form (if applicable), and

medical record. Co pies of the signed informed consent form, the signed subject authorization for m 
(if applicable), and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) shall be given to the subject.
All revised informed consent forms must be reviewed and signed by relevant subjects or the 
relevant subject’s legally  acceptable representative in the same manner as the original informed 
consent. The date the revised consent was ob tained shoul d be recorded in the subject’s medical 
record, and the subject should receive a copy  of the re vised informed consent form.
15.3 Subject Confidentiality
The sponsor and designees affirm and upho ld the principle of the subject’s right to protection 
against invasio n of privacy. Throughout this study, a subject’s source data will only be linked to 
the spons or’s clinical study  database or documentation via a unique ident ificat ion number. As 
permitted by all applicable laws and regulat ions, limited subject attributes, such as sex, age, or date 
of birth, and subject init ials may be used to verify the subject an d accuracy o f the subject’s unique 
ident ificat ion number.
To com ply with ICH Guidelines for GCP and to verify co mpliance with this protocol, the sponsor 
requi res the investigator to permit its monitor or designee’s monitor, representatives fro m any 
regul atory authori ty (eg, FDA, Medi cines and Heal thcare products Regul atory  Agency, 
Pharmaceut icals and Medical Devices Agency), the sponsor’s designated auditors, and the 
appropriate IRBs and IECs to review the subject’s original medical records (source data or 
docum ents), including, but not limited to, laboratory  test resul t reports, ECG reports, admissio n 
and discharge summaries for hospital admissio ns occurring during a subject’s study participation, 
and autopsy  reports. Access to a subject’s original medical records requi res the specific 
authori zation of the subject as part of the informed consent process (see Section 15.2).
Copi es of any  subject source d ocuments that are provided to the sponsor must have certain 
personally ident ifiable informat ion rem oved (ie, subject name, address, and other ident ifier fields 
not collected on the subject’s eCRF).
15.4 Publication, Disclosure, and Clinical Trial Registration Policy
15.4.1 Publication and Disclosure
The investigator is obliged to provide the sponsor with complete test results and all data derived by 
the invest igator from the study . During and after the study , only the sponsor m ay make study

Instructions for Processing of Serum Samples for PK Vedolizumab Analysis
1.Collect 5 mL of venous blood into a Becton -Dickinson Vacutainer. For all vedo lizumab 
samples, blood samples should be collected into glass red stopper vacutainers. Direct 
venipuncture is the only  method of bl ood collecti on.
2.Allow th e glass red top Vacutainer to sit at room temperature for approximately  60 minutes 
(refer to product informat ion for correct time) to ensure proper clot formation.
3. To separate the serum samples, centrifuge the Vacutainers for 10 minutes at approximately 
1100 to 1300 relat ive centrifugal force (RCF) at room temperature in a centrifuge. Note: if 
using a co llection device other than Becton- Dickinson, refer to m anufacturer’s instruction for 
proper centrifugation force and time.
4. To ensure a more homogeneous sample, all serum should first be transferred into 1 aliquot. 
From  there, mix well and split the serum evenly between the 2 aliquots into polypropylene 
tubes. A minimum o f 0.8mL needs to be obtained for each sample. 
5. Cap the labeled storage tubes and freeze the serum samples immediately at 
approximately  -20°C. No more than 1 hour and 45 minutes must be allowed to elapse between 
collect ing blood and freezing the serum sample.
6.Keep samples frozen at approximately -20°C or l ower until shipment to PPD Central Lab,
Highland Heights, KY. “SET 1” samples will be shipped first on dry ice, fo llowed by shipment
of duplicate “SET 2” samples after “SET 1” samples have been received.

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 0 4 30 June 2020
Change 11: Secti on 9.1.10 and Appendix A Schedule of Procedures table updated to include 
Moni tr CD testing.
The primary  change occurs in Section 9.1.10.4 Monitr Crohn's Disease Test .
New 
wording:The Monitr Crohn's Disease Test is a laborato ry-developed test from Prometheus Labs 
that evaluates mult iple markers of mucosal damage and repair processes, regardless o f 
disease l ocati on.It applies a proprietary  algorithm to 13 bi omarkers to produce a 
quant itative Endoscopi c Healing Index Score , ranging fro m 0 to 100, to aid in 
distinguishing endoscopic remissio n from act ive disease in adult CD patients .
A blood sam ple for M onitr CD will  be collected at Week 26 and Week 102 or early 
termination.
In addit ion, Baseline Week 0, Week 26 and Week 102 samp les m ay be analyzed for 
subjects who have already co mpleted those visits prior to Amendment #4. After PK 
and Immunogenicit y testing are completed, any  residual  frozen serum  aliquots from  
PK and/or Immunogenicit y testing may be repurposed for this testing. These samples 
will only be used after receiving subject consent/reconsent.
Further instruction on the co llection and handling of these samples can be found in the 
study  Laboratory  Manual.
Rationale for Change: The primary endpoint of the study  is Week 26 endoscopi c remissio n 
which requires patients to go through a Week 26 endoscopy . Another endoscopy  is requi red at 
Week 102 to evaluate the secondary endpoint of maintenance of remissio n. As a result of 
COVID -19 si tuation and to ensure safet y of patients and hospi tal staff, endoscopi es are not being 
perform ed at many  sites. In order to ensure the safety of the subjects and to be able to still capture 
some relevant data on m ucosal  healing at Week 26 and Week 102 we are introducing the 
Moni trCD tool.
Appendix ASchedule o f Study  Procedures also contains this change.
Change 12:Secti on 9.1.11 and Appendix A Schedule of Procedures table and footnote (b) 
clarified col onoscopy  may be performed at Early Terminat ion visit.
The primary  change occurs in Section 9.1.11 Colonoscopy  and Biopsy Procedure .
Initial 
wording:Colonoscopy  will be performed during screening and at Weeks 26 and 102. All study 
colonoscopi es will  be video -recorded using the Robarts Central Image Management 
Solution (CIMS). All study  endoscopy  videos will be subject to central review to 
ensure consis tent grading. A central reviewer will confirm the SES- CD inclusio n

Rationale for Change: The primary endpoint of the study  is Week 26 endoscopi c remissio n 
which requires patients to go through a Week 26 endoscopy . Another endoscopy  is requi red at 
Week 102 to evaluate the secondary endpoint of maintenance of remissio n. As a result of 
COVID -19 si tuation and to ensure safet y of patients and hospi tal staff, endoscopi es are not being 
perform ed at many  sites. In order to ensure the safety of the subjects and to be able to still capture 
some relevant data on m ucosal  healing at Week 26 and Week 102 we are introducing the

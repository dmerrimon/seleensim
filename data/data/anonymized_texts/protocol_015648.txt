Protocol Title:   A Phase 3, Randomized, Active -Controlled, Double -Blind Study Comparing 
Upadacitinib (ABT -494) to Abatacept in Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Rheumatoid 
Arthritis with Inadequate Response or Intolerance to Biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) on Stable 
Conventional Synthetic Disease Modifying Anti -Rheumatic Drugs (csDMARDs)
Objective s:  
Period 1
Tocompare the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg once daily (QD) versus abatacept intravenous 
(IV) for the treatment of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in bDMARD -inadequate 
response (bDMARD -IR) or bDMARD -intolerant subjects with moder ately to severely active RA.
Period 2
To evaluate the long -term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg QD in subjects with 
RA who have completed Period 1.
Investigators:   Multicenter
Study Site s:  Approximately 200
Study Population:   
Adult female and male subjects who are at least 18 years of age with a diagnosis of RA for ≥ 3 months 
who also fulfill the 2010 ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria 
for RA.  Subjects who have been treated ≥ 3 months prior to the screening visit with ≥ 1 bDMARD 
therapy and ≥ 3 m onths with csDMARDs and have never received abatacept, but continue to exhibit 
active RA or had to discontinue due to intolerability or toxicity, irrespective of treatment duration may 
be enrolled.  E ligible study subjects must have ≥ 6 swollen joints (based on 66 joint counts) and ≥ 6 
tender joints (based on 68 joint counts) at Screening and Baseline Visits, and high -sensitivity C -reactive 
protein (hsCRP) ≥ 3 mg/L (central lab) at Screening.  Subjects must have been on a stable dose of 
csDMARD therapy (restricted to methotrexate [MTX], chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, 
or leflunomide) for ≥ 4 w eeks prior to the first dose of study drug.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 5 50
Methodology:   
This is a Phase 3, multicenter study that includes two periods.  Period 1 is a 24 -week randomized, 
double- blind, parallel -group, active -controlled treatment period designed to compare the safety and 
efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg QD vers us abatacept IV for the treatment of signs and symptoms of 
subjects with moderately to severely active RA who have an inadequate response to or intolerance to 
bDMARD therapies other than abatacept and are currently on a stable dose of csDMARDs.  Period 2 i s 
an open -label extension to evaluate the long -term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg 
QD in subjects with RA who have completed Period 1.abbvie

10Methodology (Continued):
The study duration will include a 35 -day maximum screening period; a 24-week randomized, double 
blind, parallel -group, active controlled treatment period, w ith 30 -day and 70 -day follow -ups (Period 1); 
an open -label long term extension period (up to 5 years) w ith a 30 -day follow -up call or site visit 
(Period 2);
Subjects who meet eligibility criteria w ill be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of tw o treatment groups:
Group 1:  upadacitinib 15 mg QD, N = 275 (Period 1) 
Group 2:  Abatacept IV at Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 (< 60 kg:  500 mg; 60 –100 kg:  
750 mg; > 100 kg:  1,000 mg, N = 275 (Period 1)
NOTE:  In Period 1, subjects randomized to Group 1 under Amendment 3 received 30 mg QD dose.  
This study began enrolling under Amendment 3.  Starting with Amendment 4 or 3.01, subjects 
randomized to Group 1 will receive 15
mg QD dose.  In Period 2, subjects who enrolled under 
Amendment 3, including subjects randomized to both Group 1 and Group 2, received open -label 
upadacitinib 30 mg QD.  Subjects who enroll under Amendment 4 or 3.01 or later w ill receive open -
label upadac itinib 15 mg QD.   
Starting with Amendment 5, all subjects will receive open label upadacitinib 15 mg QD dose, including 
those currently on upadacitinib 30 mg QD.
Randomization will be stratified by number of prior bDMARD use (stratum 1:  failed 1 or 2 bi ologics of 
the same class; stratum 2:  failed ≥ 3 biologics of the same class or failed biologics of multiple classes) 
AND geographic region.  Once 20% of total subjects have been randomized who have not completed 
> 3months of methotrexate, further screening of such methotrexate inexperienced subjects may be 
suspended.
Subjects must have been on stable csDMARD(s) treatment for ≥ 4 w eeks prior to the first dose of study 
drug and must remain on a stable dose until Week 12; the csDMARD dose may be decr eased only for 
safety reasons.  Starting at Week 12 (after Week 12 assessments have been performed), initiation of or 
change in corticosteroids, non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, or adding or 
increasing doses for up to 2 csDMAR Ds (concomitant use of up to 2 csDMARDs except the 
combination of MTX and leflunomide) is allowed as per local label.
Rescue therapy will be offered to subjects who meet the following criteria:
Starting at Week 12, subjects who do not achieve ≥ 20% improve ment in both TJC and SJC at 
two consecutive visits will be rescued with optimizing (initiate or increase) background RA 
medications:  NSAIDs, corticosteroids, low -potency analgesics, acetaminophen or adding or 
increasing doses in up to 2 csDMARDs (concomit ant use of up to 2 csDMARDs except the 
combination of MTX and leflunomide) and, if necessary, a burst of systemic corticosteroids 
(prednisone equivalent ≤ 0.5 mg/kg/day for 3 consecutive days), intra -articular, intramuscular, 
intravenous, trigger point or tender point, intra -bursa, and intra- tendon sheath injections of 
corticosteroids, dosage and frequency per standard of care, are allow ed.
Subjects who complete the Week 24 visit (end of Period 1) will enter the open -label long term extension 
portion of the study, Period 2 ( 192 w eeks).  Subjects who are assigned to upadacitinib treatment group in 
Period 1 w ill continue to receive upadacitinib 15 mg QD per original randomization assignment.  
Subjects who are assigned to abatacept IV in Period 1 w ill be switch ed to receive upadacitinib 15 mg 
QD.
An unblinded analysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed Period 1 (Week 24).  Period 2 
is open -label.abbvie

Pharm acokinetic (Period 1 Only):
Blood samples for assay of upadacitinib and possibly other concomitant medications in plasma will be 
collected at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24/ Prem ature Discontinuation.
Exploratory Research Variables and Validation Studies (Optional) (Period 1 Only):
Prognostic and predictive biomarker signatures may be evaluated.  Samples for pharmacogenetic, 
epigenetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic and targeted protein investigations will be collected at various 
time points.  Assessments will include but may not be limited to nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites, or 
lipids.
Safety:
Safety evaluations include adverse event (AE) monitoring, physical examinations, vital sign 
measurements, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory testing (hematology, chemistry, and 
urinalysis) as a measure of safety and tolerability for the entire study duration.
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
All efficacy analyses will be carried out using the Full Analysis Set population, which includes all 
randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.
Period 1 Efficacy:
Analysis of the Prim ary and Key Secondary Endpoints:
The primary efficacy endpoint w ill be assessed via non -inferiority comparison of upadacitinib to 
abatacept in change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) at Week 12 using the 95% confidence interval (CI) 
of treatment difference against the pre -specified non -inferiority margin.
The tw o key secon dary efficacy endpoints involve the superiority comparisons of upadacitinib to 
abatacept on change from baseline in DAS28(CRP) at Week 12 as w ell as the proportion of subjects 
achieving CR based on DAS28 (CRP) at Week 12.  The overall type I error rate of the primary and key 
secondary endpoints will be strongly controlled via sequential testing.
For the binary endpoint of CR, frequencies and percentages will be reported for each treatment group, 
and comparison of upadacitinib to abatacept w ill be conducted using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test 
adjusting for main stratification factors.  Non -responder imputation will serve as the primary analysis 
approach for missing data handling.
For the continuous endpoint of change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP), the mean, standard deviation, 
median, and range will be reported for each treatment group.  Comparison between upadacitinib and 
abatacept w ill be carried out using the analysis of covariance model w ith treatment group as the fixed 
factor, and the corresponding baseline value and the main stratification factors as the covariates.
Multiple imputations will serve as the primary analysis approach for missing data handling.abbvie

263.0 Introduction
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic s ystemic inflammatory  disease of unknown 
etiology .  The hallmark feature of RA is an inflammatory  process manifested by  persistent 
symmetric pol yarthritis of sy novial joints which can ultimately  lead to bone erosions,
deformity , and disability .  Left untreated, or inadequately  treated, progressive functional 
impairment with increasing disability  occurs leading to a reduction in quality  of life.  The 
prevalence of RA in the general population is approximately  1%, and in creases with age 
in both genders, with women being more prone to developing RA than men.  Earl y 
therapy with disease -modify ing anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is the standard of care, 
including conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) (e.g., methotrexate [MT X], 
sulfasalazine, hy droxy chloroquine, and leflunomide), and biologic DMARDs 
(bDMARDs) (e.g., anti -tumor necrosis factor [TNF] and non -anti-TNF biologics).
The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommends a Treat -to-Target 
(T2T) approach to initia te therap y immediatel y after diagnosis of RA with a goal of 
achieving clinical remission (CR) or low disease activity  (LDA), as these are associated 
with improved long -term outcomes.1-3  Also, in line wit h recent advances in earl y 
diagnosis, new classification criteria have been developed.  The 2010 American College 
of Rheumatology  (ACR)/EULAR classification criteria redefined the paradigm of RA b y 
focusing on features at earlier stages of disease that are associated with persistent and/or 
erosive disease, rather than defining the disease by  its late -
stage features.4
JAK Inhibitor
Evidence suggests that inhibition of Janus kinase (JAK) -mediated pathway s is a 
promising approach for the treatment of patients with this chronic disease.5  AbbVie is 
developing a small molecule inhibitor of JAK, upadacitinib, that may  address the current 
needs.abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2016 -000933 -37
27The JAK family  is composed of 4 famil y members:  JAK1, 2, 3, and Tyro sine kinase 2 
(Tyk2).  These cy toplasmic ty rosine kinases are associated with membrane cy tokine 
receptors such as common gamma -chain receptors and the gly coprotein 130 
transmembrane proteins.6  Activation of JAK pathway s initiates expression of survival 
factors, cy tokines, chemokines, and other molecules that facilitate leukocy te cellular 
trafficking and cell proliferation which contribute to inflammatory  and autoimmune 
disorders.
Hence, the JAK family  has evoked considerable interest in the area of inflammatory  
diseases leading to the development of various JAK inhibitors with different selectivity  
profil es against JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Ty k2 which have demonstrated efficacy  in 
individuals with RA.7-11  Tofacitin ib, the first in this class, has been approved in the 
United States and in other countries for treating moderatel y to severel y active RA 
patients.  Although tofacitinib, a non- selective JAK inhibitor, improves the clinical signs 
and sy mptoms, and inhibits structural progression in RA patients, questions regarding the 
safet y profile remain, including serious infections, herpes zoster reactivation, 
malignancies, and hematologic adverse events (AEs).
The second generation of JAK inhibitors, with different sele ctivity  profile s against JAK1, 
JAK2, JAK3, and Ty k2, are in development.5  Upadacitinib is a novel s elective JAK1 
inhibitor being developed for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severel y 
active RA.  In an in vitro setting, upadacitinib potently  inhibits JAK1 activity , but to a 
lesser degree, inhibits the other isoforms, JAK2 and JAK3.  T he enhanced selectivity of 
upadacitinib against JAK1 may  offer an improved benefit
-risk profile in patients with RA.  
The clinical h ypothesis is that upadacitinib should be effective in decreasing joint 
inflammation and damage associated with RA by  interfering with JAK1- mediated 
signaling pathway s (i.e., interleukin- 6) without causing excessive anemia due to its 
reduced activity against JAK2 (IC 50120 nM), which is essential for ery thropoietin 
signaling.  Upadacitinib is also less potent against JAK3 (I C502.3 µM), an important 
component of ly mphocy te activation and function.  As such, treatment with upadacitinib, 
a selective JAK1 inhibitor with reduced JAK3 inhibition, could result in a decreased risk abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2016 -000933 -37
28for infection (including viral reactivation) and/or mali gnancy  compared to a pan JAK 
inhibitor or less selective JAK inhibitors.
In vitro studies suggest that upadacitinib is not an inhibitor of cy tochrome P450 (CYP) 
1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 at concentrations exceeding those relevant 
clinically .  Upadacitinib increased mRNA expression for CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in vitro 
in a concentration -dependent manner.  However, phy siologicall y-based pharmacokinetic 
modeling suggests that upadacitinib does not affect plasma concentrations of concomitant 
medications that are substrates for CYP3A or CYP2B6 at the relevant clinical doses.
Among subjects with laboratory  evidence of s ystemic inflammation (as evidenced by  
high-sensitivity  C-reactive protein [hsCRP] > upper limit of normal [ULN]), treatment 
with lower doses of upadacitinib (3 mg twice daily  (BID) and 6 mg BID) was associated 
with improvements in mean hemoglobin relative to placebo.  At higher doses, there was a 
reduction in mean hemoglobin; however, the mean hemoglobin levels remained within 
normal range thr oughout the treatment period.
3.1 Differences Statement
Study  M15 -925 differs from other upadacitinib studies as it is the first study to evaluate 
the safet y and efficacy of upadacitinib vs. abatacept in subjects with inadequate response 
to or intolerance to b DMARD treatment.
3.2 Benefits and Risks
Despite major progress in the treatment of RA, there still remains a large unmet medical 
need, as onl y a small percentage of RA patients reach or maintain a status of LDA or CR 
over time and some patients need to discont inue due to safety or tolerability issues.12,13  
Novel therapies are therefore needed to complement the available interventions to address 
the unmet need.12-14
The dose of upadacitinib selected for the Study  M15 -925 (once -daily formulation 15 mg 
QD) was chosen based on an optimal benefit to risk profile from the first two Phase 3 abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2016 -000933 -37
29studies from the RA program:  Study  M13- 549 (csDMARD -IR) and Stud y M13-542 
(bDMARD -IR).  The data from these studies showed that both the 15 mg and 30 mg QD 
doses achieved superior responses to placebo for all primary  and ranked secondary  
endpoints at Week 12 with a safet y profile consistent with the known profile from 
Phase2b studies (Studies M13 -537 [MTX -IR:  methotrexate inadequate responder] and 
M13- 550 [TNF I R:  anti- tumor necrosis factor inadequate responder] ).  
Benefits
Efficacy Results from Phase 2 Studies with Upadacitinib
Data on the benefit of treatment with u padacitinib are available from Phase 2.  The 
Phase 2 program for upadacitinib consisted of 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), both 
on stable background MTX therap y, in subjects with moderatel y to severely active RA 
and one open- label extension (OL E) study (Study  M13 -538; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) for those 
subjects who had completed either one of the RCTs.  Study  M13 -550 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
enrolled subjects who had an inadequate response to anti -TNF therap y and 
Study M13 -537 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) enrolled subjects who had shown an inadequate 
response to MTX.  A total of 4 twice dail y (BID) and 1 once daily (QD) dose regimens of 
upadacitinib immediate release capsules (3 mg BID, 6 mg BID, 12 mg BID, 18 mg BID, 
and 24 mg QD) were evaluated.
In TNF -inadequate responder (TNF- IR) subj ects, who represent the population with the 
greatest unmet need, the primary  endpoint of ACR20 response rate at Week 12 was 
significantl y greater at all doses of upadacitinib (up to 73%) compared with placebo 
(35%).  In addition, numericall y higher proport ions of subjects achieved ACR50 and 
ACR70 responses and LDA (based on Disease Activity  Score [DAS]28 C -Reactive 
Protein [CRP] and Clinical Disease Activity  Index [CDAI ]) in the upadacitinib dose 
groups versus placebo.
In MTX -inadequate responder (MTX -IR) s ubjects, the primary  endpoint of ACR20 
response rate at Week 12 was significantly  greater (up to 82%) at all but the lowest dose abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2016 -000933 -37
30of upadacitinib compared with placebo (50%).  At all doses of upadacitinib compared to 
placebo, significantl y higher proportion s of subjects achieved LDA and CR at Week 12.
Risks
The results of all genetic toxicology  testing indicate that upadacitinib is not genotoxic.
Embry onic and Fetal Development studies were conducted to determine the 
developmental toxicity , including the ter atogenic potential and toxicokinetics, of 
upadacitinib when administered to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis.  
Results of these studies indicate that upadacitinib is teratogenic in both rats and rabbits.  
upadacitinib administration was associated with skeletal malformations in rats at all doses 
in the absence of maternal toxicity  and cardiac malformations in rabbits concurrent with 
maternal toxicity  (only  at the high dose of 25 mg/kg/day ).  Based on these findings, all 
women of childbear ing potential must agree to use protocol -specified pregnancy  
avoidance measures as outlined in the protocols.
Safety  data from the two Phase 2 RCTs described above (N = 575) showed that the ty pes 
and frequencies of AEs during upadacitinib treatment were co nsistent with subjects with 
moderatel y to severel y active RA receiving immunomodulatory therap y.  The incidences 
of AEs were numerically higher in the upadacitinib dose groups, with a trend toward 
higher rates with higher doses of upadacitinib.  The most f requentl y reported AEs (≥ 5%) 
in the upadacitinib treated subjects were urinary tract infection, headache, upper 
respiratory  tract infection, and nausea.  There were 6 subjects (1.3% of total combined 
populations) with herpes zoster reactivation distribute d across the upadacitinib dose 
groups, and 2 subjects (1.9%) in the placebo groups.  I n these two 12 week studies, a total 
of 2 subjects in the upadacitinib treatment groups reported malignancies.  One subject 
reported non- melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) (bas al cell and squamous cell carcinoma) 
and 1 subject was diagnosed with lung cancer 11 day s after the final scheduled visit, and 
subsequently  died 14 weeks after study  completion.  These events were reported by  the 
Investigators as not possibly  related to st udy drug.  No events of gastrointestinal 
perforation were reported.  Elevations of liver function tests were sporadic with no clear abbvie

31dose response relationship observed.  As observed with other JAK inhibitors, treatment 
with upadacitinib resulted in an incr ease in lipids (low -densit y lipoprotein cholesterol 
[LDL -C] and high density  lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL -C]).  There was a trend for lower 
red blood cell counts especiall y at the 2 highest doses (12 mg BID and 18 mg BID), lower 
white blood cell counts and reductions in Natural Killer (NK) cells.  
The Phase 2 program with upadacitinib demonstrated efficacy  for improvement in signs 
and sy mptoms of RA and the safet y results were consistent with those known to be 
associated with JAK inhibition.13-21  Taken together, the safet y and efficacy data from the 
Phase 2 program show a favorable benefit:risk profile for upadacitinib that supports 
further development of upadacitinib in Phase 3 in subjects with RA.
Many adverse events (AEs) (serious infections, herpes zoster reactivation, malignancies, 
and hematologic AEs) observed with pan -JAK inhibition are thought to be a consequence 
of lack of selectivity  against the members of the JAK famil y of proteins.  Upadacitin ib is a 
novel selective JAK1 inhibitor with the ability  to decrease inflammation mediated by  
JAK1 signaling while having less inhibitory  effects on JAK2 and JAK3.  This could 
potentially  minimize some of the reported safet y concerns with non- selective JAK 
inhibition which are thought to be mediated b y inhibition of JAK2 and JAK3 signaling 
pathway s. 
The safet y profile specific to upadacitinib is evolving with safety results to date consistent 
with those known to be associated with JAK inhibition.  AEs in th e categories of infection 
such as urinary  tract infection, upper respiratory  tract infection and herpes zoster 
reactivation have been reported as well as AEs in the categories of malignancies, and 
gastrointestinal disorders such as gastrointestinal perfora tion. 
In addition, laboratory  changes observed with upadacitinib include elevations of serum 
transaminases, lipids, creatinine and creatine phosphokinase; both increased and reduced 
hemoglobin, depending on baseline inflammatory  burden; and reductions in white blood 
cell counts, including Natural Killer (NK) cells.abbvie

32The results of all genetic toxicology  testing indicate that upadacitinib is not genotoxic, 
however upadacitinib may  be teratogenic, which necessitates avoidance of pregnancy  in 
women of childbea ring potential.
A detailed discussion of the pre- clinical and clinical toxicology , metabolism, 
pharmacology  and safet y experience with upadacitinib can be found in the current 
Investigator 's Brochure.
Taken together, the safety  and efficacy  data from upada citinib studies to date show a 
favorable benefit:risk profile for upadacitinib in the treatment of various 
autoimmune/inflammatory disorders and support the continued investigation of 
upadacitinib in patients with various immune mediated inflammatory  condi tions.
In view of the COVID -19 pandemic, the benefit:risk profile of various 
immunomodulatory  therapies on COVID -19 is being evaluated.  At this time, the effects 
of upadacitinib on the course of COVID -19 are not well defined.

335.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 3, multicenter study  that includes two periods.  Period 1 is the 24 -week 
randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, active -controlled treatment period designed to 
compare the safet y and efficacy  of upadacitinib 15 mg versus abatacept for the treatme nt 
of signs and s ymptoms of subjects with moderately  to severel y active RA who have an 
inadequate response to or intolerance to bDMARD therap y and are currently on a stable 
dose of csDMARDs and have never received abatacept.  Period 2 is an open -label 
long-term extension to evaluate the long -term safety , tolerability , and efficacy  of 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD in subjects with RA who have completed Period 1.   Starting with 
Amendment 5, all subjects will receive open -label upadacitinib 15 mg QD, including 
those c urrentl y on upadacitinib 30 mg QD.
The study  is designed to enroll approximately  550 subjects at approximately  200 study  
centers worldwide to meet scientific and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue 
number of subjects in alignment with ethical 
considerations.  Therefore, if the target 
number of subjects has been enrolled, there is a possibility  that additional subjects in 
screening may  not be enrolled.
The study  duration will include a 35 -day screening period; a 24 -week randomized, 
double -blind, parallel -group, active controlled treatment period with 30 and 70 day  
follow -ups (Period 1); and a 192- week open- label extension period with a 30- day follow -
up call or site visit (Period 2).
Subjects who meet eligibility  criteria will be randomized in a 1 :1 ratio to one of 
twotreatment groups:
●Group 1:  upadacitinib 15 mg QD, N = 275(Period 1) 
●Group 2:  Abatacept IV at Day  1, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 [ < 60 kg:  
500mg; 60 – 100 kg:  750 mg; > 100 kg:  1,000 mg, N = 275 (Period 1) ]abbvie

34NOTE:  In Period 1, subjects randomized to Group 1 under Amendment 3 received 30 mg 
QD dose.  This study began enrolling under Amendment 3.  Starting with Amendment 4 
or 3.01, subjects randomized to Group 1 will receive 15 mg QD dose.  In Period 2, 
subjects who enrolled un der Amendment 3, including subjects randomized to both 
Group 1 and Group 2, will continue to receive open -label upadacitinib 30 mg QD.  
Subjects who enroll under Amendment 4 or 3.01 or later will receive open -label 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD.  Starting with Amendment 5, all subjects will receive open label 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD including those currentl y on upadacitinib 30 mg QD.
Subjects must have been on a stable dose of csDMARD(s) for ≥ 4 weeks prior to the 
firstdose of study  drug and must remain on a stable dose until Week 12; the csDMARD 
dose may  be decreased only  for safet y reasons.  Starting at Week 12, subjects who do not 
achieve ≥ 20% improvement in both TJC and SJC at two consecutive visits will be 
rescued with optimizing (initiate or increase) backgrou nd RA medications:  NSAIDs, 
corticosteroids, low -potency  analgesics, acetaminophen, or adding or increasing doses in 
up to 2 csDMARDs (concomitant use of up to 2 csDMARDs except the combination of 
MTX and leflunomide), and, if necessary , a burst of sy stemi c corticosteroids (prednisone 
equivalent ≤ 0.5 mg/kg/day  for 3 consecutive days), intra -articular, intramuscular, 
intravenous, trigger point or tender point, intra- bursa, and intra -tendon sheath injections of 
corticosteroids, dosage and frequency  per standard of care, are allowed as per local label.
Subjects who complete the Week 24 visit (end of Period 1) will enter the open -label 
long-term extension portion of the study , Period 2 (192 weeks).  Subjects who are 
assigned to upadacitinib in Period 1 will con tinue to receive upadacitinib 15 mg QD per 
original randomization assignment in an open -label manner.  Subjects who are assigned to 
abatacept for 24 weeks of Period 1 will be switched to receive upadacitinib 15 mg QD in 
Period 2.
An unblinded anal ysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed Period 1 
(Week 24) for the purpose of regulatory  submission.  abbvie

Screening Period
Within 35 day s prior to the Baseline Visit, subjects will receive a full explanation of the 
study  design and stud y procedures, provide a w ritten informed consent, and undergo the 
screening procedures outlined in Appendix D.  Lab values can be re -tested once during 
the screening period.   If the re -tested lab value(s) remain(s) exclusionary, the subject will 
be considered a screen failure with no additional re- screening possible.  Redrawing 
samples if previous samples were unable to be analy zed would not count as a retest since 
previous r esult was never obtained.
Subjects that initially  screen fail for the study  are permitted to re -screen once following 
re-consent.  Lab values can be re- tested once during the rescreening period.  For abbvie

37additional re -screenings, AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medica l Director approval is required.  
All screening procedures with the possible exceptions noted below will be repeated during 
re-screening.  The subject must meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria at 
the time of re -screening in order to qualify  for the study .  There is no minimum period of 
time a subject must wait to re- screen for the study.  If the subject had a complete initial 
screening evaluation including the assessment of an I nterferon -Gamma Release Assay  
(IGRA; QuantiFERON Tuberculos is [TB] Gold I n Tube test) and/or a purified protein 
derivative (PPD) test (or equivalent) (or both if required per local guidelines), or chest x -
ray and electrocardiogram (ECG), these tests will not be required to be repeated for re-
screening provided the conditions noted in Section 5.2are met, there are no changes in the 
subject 's medical history  that would warrant re -testing, and no more than 90 d ays have 
passed.
Period 1 (24- Week Randomized, Double -Blind Treatment Period)
Period 1 will begin at the Baseline Visit (Day  1) and will end at the Week 24 Visit.  At the 
Baseline Visit, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusio n 
criteria described in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 will be enrolled into the study  and 
randomized to double -blind treatment.  During this period of the study , subjects will visit 
the study  site at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24.  A ± 3 day  window is permitted around 
scheduled stud y visits.  The last dose of oral study  drug in Period 1 is taken the day  prior 
to the Week 24 visit, and the last dose of intravenous study drug in Period 1 is infused at 
the Week 20 visit.  Subjects who complete Period 1, but decide not to continue in Period 2 
should complete the 30 and 70 day  follow -up visits after the last dose of study  drug.
●Starting at Week 12 subjects who do not achieve ≥ 20% improvement in both 
TJC and SJC at two consecutive visits should have background medication(s) 
adjusted or initiated (see below).
●Starting at Week 12, subjects who demonstrate worsening of joint count (SJC 
or TJC) from baseline at 2 consecutive visits should be discontinued from 
study  drug and treated with standard of care at the discretion of the clinician.abbvie

38Period 2 (Open Label Long-T erm Extension Period [192 Weeks])
●Period 2 will begin at the Week 24 Visit after all assessments have been 
completed.  During Period 2, subjects will have a study  visit at Weeks 28, 32, 
36, 48, and every  12 weeks thereafter through Week 216/PD.  A ± 7 day  
window is permitted around scheduled stud y visits.  
● As was started at Week 12, subjects who do not achieve ≥ 20% improvement 
in both TJC and SJC at two consecutive visits should have background 
medication(s) adjusted or initiated. Subjects who demonstrat e worsening of 
joint count (SJC or TJC) from baseline at 2 consecutive visits should be 
discontinued from study  drug and treated according to standard of care and at 
the discretion of the clinician.
● Starting at Week 28 and thereafter, subjects who fail to achieve ≥20% 
improvement in both TJC and SJC from baseline at two consecutive visits, 
despite optimization of background RA therapies (see Section 5.2.3.1 for 
permitted background RA therapies) should be discontinued from study  drug 
and treated according to standard of care and at the discretion of the clinician. 
●Starting at Week 28 and thereafter, subjects who achieve ≥ 20% improvement 
in both TJC and SJC from baseline, but fail to achieve CDAI ≤ 10 at 
twoconsecutive visits, should be given the option (at the discretion of their 
physician) either to continue or discontinue study  drug and be treated 
according to standard of care and at the discreti on of the clinician.
Discontinuation of Study Drug and Continuation of Study Participation Period 1 
and Period 2)
Subjects may  discontinue study  drug treatment but may  choose to continue to participate 
in the study  (refer to Section 5.4.1 for additional details).  Subjects who prematurely 
discontinue study  drug should complete a Premature Discontinuation (PD) visit as soon as 
possible, preferabl y within 2 weeks , and preferably  prior to initiation of another therapy .  
To minimize missing data for efficacy  and safet y assessments, subjects who prematurel y 
discontinue study  drug treatment should continue to be followed for all regularly  
scheduled visits as outlined in the Activity  Schedule ( Appendix Dand Appendix F), 
unles s subjects have decided to discontinue study  participation entirel y (withdrawal of abbvie

39informed consent).  Subjects should be advised on the continued scientific importance of 
their data even if they  discontinue treatment with study  drug earl y.  Following 
discontinuation of study  drug, the subject should be treated in accordance with the 
investigator 's best clinical judgment irrespective of whether the subject decides to 
continue participation in the study .  As the subject has discontinued study  drug, all rescu e-
and efficacy -driven discontinuation criteria no longer appl y.  This includes the 20% 
TJC/SJC calculations at Week 12 and visits thereafter, as well as the CDAI calculation at 
Week 28, if applicable.  If at an y point a subject no longer wants to provide assessments 
(withdrawal of informed consent) following discontinuation of study  drug, a second PD 
visit is not required.
Premature Discontinuation of Study (Withdrawal of Informed Consent) (Period 1 
and Period 2)
Subjects may withdraw from the study  comple tely (withdrawal of informed consent) for 
any reason at any  time (refer to Section 5.4.1 for additional details).  If a subject 
prematurel y discontinues study  drug treatment and study  participation (withdrawal of 
informed consent), the procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation visit (PD 
visit) should be completed as soon as possib le, preferabl y within 2 weeks of study  drug 
discontinuation , and preferabl y prior to initiation of another therap y.  In addition, if the 
subject is willing, a 30 -day and a 70- day follow -up visit (or phone call if a visit is not 
possible) may  occur in Perio d 1, and a 30 -day follow -up visit (or phone call if a visit is 
not possible) may  occur in Period 2, to determine the status of any  ongoing adverse 
events/serious adverse events (AEs/SAEs) or the occurrence of an y new AEs/SAEs.
Follow -Up Visit
Follow -Up Vis its will occur approximately  30 day s and 70 day s after the last dose of 
study  drug in Period 1 and will occur approximately  30 day s after the last dose of study  
drug in Period 2, to obtain information on an y new or ongoing AE/SAEs, and to collect 
vital sig ns and clinical laboratory  tests.

drug in Period 1 and 30 day s after the last dose of study  drug in Period 2.
Protocol Modifications due to State of Emergency or Pandemic like COVID
-19
Study  visits may  be impacted bya pandemic situation (including the COVID-19 
pandemic) or an y state of emergency. If visits cannot be conducted onsite due to travel 
restrictions or other pandemic -related reasons, virtual visits, visits at alternative locations, 
or changes in the visit frequency  and timing of study  procedures, among others may  be 
performed. Additional details are provided in the subsequent sections. Every  effort 
should be made to ensur e the safet y of subjects and site staff, while maintaining the 
integrit y of the stud y.

47The AbbV ie Therapeutic Area Medical Director should be contacted if there are any  
questions regarding concomitant or prior therapies.
5.2.3.1 Permitted Background RA  Therapy
Subjects should continue on their stable ( ≥ 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study  drug) 
backgro und csDMARD therap y (restricted to oral or parenteral MTX, [7.5 to 
25 mg/week;], sulfasalazine [ ≤ 3000 mg/day ], hydroxy chloroquine, [≤ 400 mg/day ], 
chloroquine [ ≤ 250 mg/day ], and leflunomide [≤ 20 mg/day ]) up to Week 12.  At any  
time, the csDMARD dose may be decreased onl y for safety  reasons.  Subjects taking 
MTX should take a dietary  supplement of oral folic acid (or equivalent, such as folinic 
acid) throughout study  participation.  Folic acid dosing and timing of regimen should be 
followed according to I nvestigator' s instructions.  AbbVie will not provide the 
csDMARDs (or folic acid, if taking MTX).
Subjects should continue on their stable doses of NSAIDs, acetaminophen/paracetamol, 
oral corticosteroids (equivalent to prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day ), or inhaled corticosteroids.
●If taking an y of the above on a scheduled basis, they should continue to take 
them as they  did at study  entry  with no change in dose or frequency , including 
on study  visit day s
●If not taking an y of the above at baseline, these must not be initiated except 
where permitted b y protocol (specific time period or protocol
-defined rescue)
●If taking an y of the above, including low potency  analgesics, i.e., tramadol, 
codeine, h ydrocodone, or propox yphene at baseline on an as- needed basis 
(PRN), they should continue to use them for the same reason and same dose 
each time but they  should not be taken within the 24 hours prior to any  study  
visit to avoid bias in outcome measurements.
In the event of tolerability (or other safet y) issues, in Period 1, the doses of these 
medications may  be decreased or discontinued with substitution of another permitted 
medication from that class (see Section 5.2.3.2 for prohibited therapies).  abbvie

48PRN use of inhaled corticosteroids is permitted at any  time.
●Starting at Week 12 (after Week 12 assessments have been performed) and 
thereafter, intra -articular, intramuscular, intravenous, trigger point or tender 
point, int ra-bursa, and intra -tendon sheath injections of corticosteroids, dosage 
and frequency  per standard of care, are allowed.  To avoid confounding effects 
of sy stemic absorption of intra -articular corticosteroids, joint injections should 
be avoided, if possibl e, within 21 day s prior to the next scheduled study  visit.  
For the anal ysis of the TJC and SJC, injected joints will be considered " not 
assessable " for 3 months from the time of the intra-articular injection.  For RA 
flare treatment, no more than 3 consec utive day s of sy stemic corticosteroids 
(maximum dose of 0.5 mg/kg of prednisone or its equivalent) is allowed, after 
which subject should resume their usual dail y oral corticosteroid dose.
● In addition, in Period 2, starting at Week 24 (after Week 24 assess ments have 
been performed), initiation, change or discontinuation of corticosteroids, 
NSAIDs, acetaminophen/paracetamol or csDMARDs (restricted to oral or 
parenteral MTX, sulfasalazine, h ydrox ychloroquine, chloroquine and 
leflunomide except the combination of MTX and leflunomide) is allowed per 
local label.
5.2.3.2 Prohibited Therapy
JAK Inhibitor
Prior exposure to JAK inhibitors and concurrent use during the study  (including but not 
limited to tofacitinib [Xeljanz®], baricitinib, and filgotinib) is not allowed.

Investigational Drugs
Subjects who have been treated with an y investigational drug within 30 days or 
fivehalf-lives of the drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study  drug are 
excluded from participation in this study .  Investigational drugs are also prohibited during 
the study .
Vaccines
Although not mandated by  the protocol, vaccines recommended by  local guidelines 
should be considered.  If the subject and investigator choose to administer live vaccines, 
these vaccines must be completed (per local label) 4 weeks before the first dose of study  
drug wi th appropriate precautions and is not allowed during study  participation (in 
Period 1) including at least 12 weeks after the last dose of IV stud y drug and at least 
4weeks after last dose of oral study  drug.  
Examples of live vaccines include, but are no t limited to, the following:
●Monovalent live influenza A (H1N1) (intranasal);
●Seasonal trivalent live influenza (intranasal);
●Zostavax (herpes zoster, live attenuated);
●Rotavirus;
● Varicella (chicken pox);
●Measles -mumps- rubella or measles mumps rubella varicella;abbvie

52●Oral polio vaccine;
●Smallpox;
●Yellow fever;
●Bacille Calmette -Guérin (BCG);
●Typhoid.
In Period 2, if a live vaccine must be administered during stud y participation, study drug 
must be held for at least 30 day s prior to the vaccination and at lea st 30 days after the 
vaccination (or longer if required locally ).
If the live herpes zoster vaccine is to be administered and there is no known history  of 
primary  varicella (chicken pox), preexisting immunity  to varicella should be confirmed 
with antibody  testing prior to administration of the herpes zoster vaccine.  If varicella 
antibody  testing is negative, the live herpes zoster vaccine should not be administered.
Administration of inactivated (non -live) vaccines is permitted during the study  according 
to local practice guidelines.  Examples of common vaccines that are inactivated, toxoid or 
biosy nthetic, include but are not limited to:  injectable influenza vaccine, pneumococcal, 
Shingrix (zoster vaccine, recombinant, adjuvanted) and, pertussis (Tdap) va ccines).
Traditional Chinese Medicine
Traditional oral Chinese medicine is not permitted during the stud y as these may interfere 
with upadacitinib metabolism and exposure and may  impact efficacy  and safety  of 
upadacitinib treatment.  Subjects must have discontinued traditional Chinese medicine at 
least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study  drug.
5.2.3.3 Rescue Therapy
Rescue therap y will be offered to subjects who meet the following criteria from Week 12 
to Week 24:abbvie 
Upadacitinib

53Starting at Week 12 and thereafter, subject s who do not achieve ≥ 20% improvement in 
both TJC and SJC as compared to baseline at two consecutive visits will be rescued by  
optimizing (initiate or increase) background RA medications.  
●Initiation of or change in csDMARDs (concomitant use of up to 2 c sDMARDs 
except the combination of MTX and leflunomide; see Inclusion Criterion 4) is 
allowed as per local label.  
●Initiation or change in NSAI Ds, acetaminophen, corticosteroids, low -potency  
analgesics, and, if necessary , a burst of s ystemic corticosteroid s (prednisone 
equivalent ≤ 0.5 mg/kg/day  for 3 consecutive day s) intra -articular, 
intramuscular, intravenous, trigger point or tender point, intra -bursa, and intra -
tendon sheath injections of corticosteroids, dosage and frequency  per standard 
of care, are allowed as per local label.
Starting at Week 12 and thereafter, subjects who demonstrate worsening of joint count 
(SJC or TJC) from baseline at 2 consecutive visits should be discontinued from study  drug 
and treated according to standard of care and at th e discretion of the clinician.
5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations
Contraception Recommendation for Females
A woman who is postmenopausal or permanentl y surgically  sterile (bilateral 
oophorectom y, bilateral salpingectomy or h ysterectomy ) is not considered to be a woman 
of childbearing potential and is not required to follow contraception recommendations.  
Postmenopausal is defined as:
●Age ≥ 55 y ears with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause; or
●Age < 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause AND a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level > 40 mIU/mL .
If the female subject is < 55 y ears of age:abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2016 -000933 -37
54AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history  of permanent surgical 
sterilization (defined above), FSH should be tested at Screening.
●
If FSH is not tested, it is assumed that the subject is of childbearing potential 
and protocol -specified contraception is required.
● If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with post- menopausal status,
contraception is not required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with pre -menopausal status, 
contraception is required , and a serum pregnancy  test must be performed (see 
Section 5.3.1.1 , pregnancy test) .
For a female subject at any  age:
● Female subjects with menses within the past 12 months are of childbearing 
potential and FSH is therefore not required but contraception is required.
●Female subjects who are surgically  sterile (defined above) are not of 
childbearing potential and therefore no FSH testing or contraception is 
required.
A woman who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently  surgicall y 
sterile is considered of childbearing potential and is required to practice at least one of the 
following highly  effective methods of birth control that is effective from Study  Day  1 (or 
earlier) through at least 98 day s (Period 1)/30 day s (Period 2) after the last dose of study  
drug.
●Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception 
(oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectable) associated with the inhibition of 
ovulation, initiated at least 30 day s prior to Study  Day  1.
●Progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 1 month prior to Study  
Day 1.
●Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation.abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6

55●Vasectomized partner(s), provided the vasectomized partner verbally  confirms 
receipt of medical assessment of the surgical success, and is the sole sexual 
partner of the WOCBP trial participant.
●Intrauterine device (IUD).
●Intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem (IUS).
● True abstinence (if acceptable per local requirements):  Refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse when this is in line with the preferred and usual 
lifesty le of the subject [periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, post- ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable].
If required per local practices, male or fe male condom with or without spermicide OR 
cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide should be used in addition to one of the highly  
effective birth control methods listed above (excluding true abstinence).
If during the course of the study  a woman becomes surgically  sterile or post -menopausal 
(defined above) and complete documentation is available, contraceptive measures as 
defined above are no longer required.
It is important to note that contraception requirements described above are specificall y 
intended to prevent pregnancy  during exposure to the investigational therapy  upadacitinib.  
The concomitant csDMARDs (i.e., methotrexate, sulfasalazine, etc.) have been prescribed 
per standard of care prior to study  entry  and are allowed to be continued during the study .  
Contraception should continue while the subject is on the concomitant csDMARD(s) and 
that duration of contraception after discontinuation of the csDMARD(s) should be based 
on the local label.
Additional local requirements may  appl y.  Refer to Appendix Cfor additional local 
requirements.
Contraception Recommendation for Males
There are no contraception requirements for male subjects receiving upadacitinib or their 
female partner(s) .abbvie

61TB Testing/TB Prophylaxis
The TB screening tests are diagnostic te st results to be interpreted in the context of the 
subject 's epidemiology , history , exam findings, etc., and it is the responsibility  of the 
Investigator to determine if a subject has previous, active, or latent TB.  Expert 
consultation for the evaluation and/or management of TB may  be considered per 
Investigator discretion. 
At screening, all subjects will be assessed for evidence of increased risk for TB by  a risk 
assessment form ( Appendix I) and tested for TB infection by  QuantiFERON -TB Gold 
test.  The PPD Skin Test should be utilized only  when a QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test is 
not possible for an y reason (unless both tests are required per local guidelines).  The sit e 
staff will complete the TB risk assessment form and enter the data into an appropriate 
eCRF.  TB risk assessment form will be completed annually for all subjects, regardless of 
TB test results.
If a subject had a negative QuantiFERON -TB Gold (and/or PPD) test (or IGRA 
equivalent such as T -SPOT TB test) within 90 days prior to Screening and source 
documentation is available, the test does not need to be repeated, provided nothing has 
changed in the subject 's medical history  to warrant a repeat test.  These cases may  be 
discussed with the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director.  The results of the TB 
test(s) will be retained at the site as the original source documentation.
Subjects with a negative TB test and chest x- ray (CXR) not suggestive of active TB or 
prior TB exposure may  be enrolled.
Subjects with a positive TB test must be assessed for evidence of active TB versus latent 
TB, including signs and sy mptoms and CXR.  Subjects with no signs or s ymptoms and a 
CXR not suggestive of active TB may  be enrol led after initiation of TB prophy laxis (see 
below).  
Subjects with evidence of active TB must not be enrolled. abbvie

62For subjects with a negative TB test result at Screening or most recent evaluation, an 
annual TB follow -up test will be performed.  If an annua l TB test is newly  positive 
(seroconversion), a chest x- ray (CXR) needs to be performed as soon as possible to aid in 
distinguishing active versus latent TB.  An y positive TB screen after the patient has 
started the study , should be reported as an adverse event of latent TB or active TB (as 
applicable). 
For subjects with seroconversion on anannual TB test, if a CXR cannot be done due to
state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, the Investigator should contact 
the AbbVie TA MD to determine if the subject may  continue on study  drug.  CXR should 
be performed as soon as restrictions allow at the study  site or local hospital/facility .   
If the subject is experiencing signs or s ymptoms suspicious for TB or something has 
changed in the subject 's medical history  to warrant a repeat test before the next scheduled 
annual TB re -test, the case (including the TB test results) must be discussed with the 
AbbVie TA MD.
TB test:
●Subjects with documentation of prior positive result of QuantiFERON -TB 
Gold Test 
(or equivalent) and/or PPD are not required to repeat either test at 
Screening or during the study  and should be considered positive.
●For regions that require both PPD and QuantiFERON -TB Gold testing, both 
will be performed.  If either PPD or QuantiFERON -TB Gold is positive, the 
TB test is considered positive.
● The PPD Skin Test (also known as a TB Skin Test or Mantoux Test) should be 
utilized only  when a QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test is not possible for any  
reason (unless both tests are required per local guidel ines).
●If only  a PPD is placed at screening, then the TB test should be used for the 
remainder of the stud y for that subject is the PPD.  Similarly , if a subject 
enters the stud y with a QuantiFERON -TB Gold test (or equivalent) alone, then 
the subject shoul d have t heir annual TB test performed with a QuantiFERON-
TB Gold test.abbvie

M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2016 -000933 -37
63●If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test is NOT possible (or if both the 
QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test and the PPD Skin Test are required per local 
guidelines):  the PPD Skin Test (also known as a TB Skin Test) will be 
performed.  The TB Skin Test should be read b y alicensed healthcare 
professional between 48 and 72 hours after administration.  A subject who 
does not return within 72 hours will need to be rescheduled for another skin 
test.  The react ion will be measured in millimeters (mm) of induration and 
induration ≥ 5 mm for RA subjects is considered a positive reaction.  The 
absence of induration will be recorded as "0 mm "not "negative. "  Subjects 
who have had an ulcerating reaction to the TB Sk in Test in the past should not 
be re -exposed and the TB Skin Test should be considered positive , with no 
requirement for subsequent testing with either PPD or QuantiFERON -TB Gold 
Plus.
●If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold test is indeterminate, then the investigator
should perform a local QuantiFERON -TB Gold test (or through the central 
laboratory  if not locall y available) to rule out a positive test result.  I f testing 
remains indeterminate or is positive, then the subject is considered to be 
positive for the purpos e of this study .  If the testing result is negative, then the 
patient is considered to be negative.
●Interpretation of a positive annual TB test in low risk subjects:  I n cases where 
the QuantiFERON -TB Gold Plus test by  the central laboratory
 is positive and 
the investigator considers the subject at low risk for TB and has no clinical 
suspicion of TB, the investigator may  perform a local QuantiFERON -TB Gold 
Plus test (or repeat testing through the central laboratory  if not locall y 
available) to confirm the p ositive test result.  I f the repeat testing result is 
negative, the investigator may  consider the test to be negative based on his/her 
clinical judgment; if the repeat testing result is positive or indeterminate, the 
test is considered positive.
●An equival ent Interferon Gamma Release Assay  (IGRA) (such as T- SPOT TB 
test) may  be substituted for the QuantiFERON -TB Gold Plus.abbvie

64TB proph ylaxis:
At screening, if the subject has evidence of latent TB, proph ylactic treatment must be 
initiated at least 2 weeks prior to administration of study  drug (or per local guidelines, 
whichever is longer); At least 6 months of prophy laxis needs to be completed to remain in 
the study .
Of note:  Rifampicin or Rifapentine is not allowed for TB prophylaxis.
Subjects with a prior history  of latent TB that have documented completion of a full 
course of anti -TB therapy  will be allowed to enter the study  provided nothing has changed 
in the subject 's medical history  to warrant repeat treatment.  For subjects with completion 
of a full c ourse of anti- TB therapy , but insufficient documentation, the investigator should 
consult with the AbbVie TA MD.
Newl y initiated proph ylactic treatment should be captured in the eCRF and in the source 
documents.  Prior therapy should be captured in the eCR F.
During the study , subjects with new evidence of latent TB should initiate prophy lactic 
treatment immediatel y per local guidelines and complete at least 6 months of proph ylaxis.  
TB proph ylaxis should be initiated and study  drug(s) should not be withheld.  2 to 
4weeks later, the subject should be re -evaluated (unscheduled visit) for signs and 
symptoms as well as laboratory  assessment of toxicity  to TB prophy laxis.
Chest X -Ray (CXR)
A CXR (posterior -anterior and lateral views) is required:
●For all subject s at Screening to rule out the presence of TB or other clinically  
relevant findings.  The CXR will not be required if the subject had a previous 
normal CXR (posterior -anterior and lateral views) within 90 day s of 
Screening, provided all so urce documentatio n is available at the site, as 
outlined below and provided nothing has changed in the subject' s medical 
history  to warrant a repeat test.abbvie

65●Every  48 weeks for subjects with newly  identified TB risk factors as 
determined by the TB risk assessment form ( Appendix I), or for subjects living 
in areas endemic for TB or for subjects with newly positive PPD and/or 
QuantiFERON -TB Gold test.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, if a visit requires 
completion of a CXR, the CXR will be performed at the next earliest feasible visit, unless 
the Investiga tor has determined, based on clinical judgement, that a CXR is required to 
ensure that it is safe to continue study  drug administration. In this case, CXR should be 
performed as soon as restrictions allow at the study site or local hospital/facility .   
Subjects can have a repeat CXR at any  time during the study  as warranted, based on the 
opinion of the Investigator.
A radiologist or pulmonologist must perform an assessment of the CXR.  The Principal 
Investigator will indicate the clinical significance of an y findings and will sign and date 
the report.  In the assessment of the CXR, the Principal Investigator or their delegate must 
indicate the presence or absence of (1) calcified granulomas, (2) pleural 
scarring/thickening, and (3) signs of active TB.  If the CXR demonstrates changes 
suggestive of previous TB (e.g., calcified nodule, fibrotic scar, apical or basilar pleural 
thickening) or other findings that are clinically  significant, the Principal Investigator 
should contact the AbbVie Medical Monitor bef ore enrolling the subject.
12-Lead ECG
For all subjects, a resting 12- lead ECG will be performed at screening, Week 48 and every  
48 weeks thereafter, as specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F.  For subjects who do 
not enter Period 2 or prematurely  discontinue from study , an ECG will be performe d at 
their final visit as indicated in Appendix Dand Appendix F.  A qualified phy sician will 
interpret the clinical significance of an y abnormal finding, sign, and date each ECG.  ECG 
with QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia' s correction formula (QTcF) 
should be reported (or calculated) and documented in the source documents and later abbvie 
Upadacitinib

66transcribed on to the appropriate eCRF if QTcF prolongation is observed.  A valid QTcF 
cannot be calculated in subjects who have a pacemaker or supraventricular or ventricular 
conduction abnorma lities.  I n cases of QTcF prolongation, the baseline QTcF will need to 
be entered into the appropriate eCRF for comparison as well.  In addition, any  clinically  
significant findings will be documented in the source documents and later transcribed on 
to the appropriate eCRF.  Each signed original ECG will be monitored by  the responsible 
site monitor and kept with subject' s source documents onsite.
For subjects with a normal ECG taken within 90 days of Screening, a repeat ECG at 
Screening will not be required , provided source documentation is available and provided 
nothing has changed in the subject 's medical history  to warrant a repeat test.  If there are 
other findings that are clinically  significant, the Investigator must contact the AbbVie 
Therapeutic Area Medical Director before enrolling the subject.
Subjects can have a repeat ECG at an y time during the stud y as warranted, based on the 
opinion of the Investigator.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, if a visit requires 
completion of an ECG , the 
ECG will be performed at the next earliest feasible visit , 
unless the Investigator has determined, based on clinical judgem ent, that an ECG is 
required to ensure that it is safe to continue study  drug administration .In this case, the 
ECG should be performed as soon as restrictions allow at the study  site or local 
hospital/facility . 
Height and Weight
Height will be measured at the Screening Visit only (with shoes off).  Body weight will be 
measured at all scheduled visits, as specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F.  All 
measurements will be recorded in metric units where applicable.abbvie

67Vital Signs
Vital sign determinations of sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure in sitting position, pulse 
rate, respiratory  rate, and body  temperature will be obtained at visits specified in 
Appendix Dand Appendix F.  Blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, and 
respiratory  rate should be performed before blood draws are performed.
Physical Examination
A complete ph ysical examination will be performed at the designated study  visits as 
specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F.  The phy sical examination at the Baseline Visit 
will serve as the baseline phy sical examination for the entire study .  Phy sical examination 
abnormalities noted b y the Investigator at Bas eline prior to the first dose of study  drug 
will be recorded in the subject' s medical history ; abnormalities noted after the first dose of 
study  drug will be evaluated and documented b y the Investigator as to whether or not the 
abnormality  is an AE (see Se ction 6.1.1.1 for AE definition).  All findings, whether 
related to an AE or part of each subject 's medical history , will be captured on the 
appropriate eCRF page.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, if a visit by  phone or video 
conference occurs at one of the designated stud y visit
s specified to complete phy sical 
examination, the complete phy sical examination will be performed at the next feasible 
visit.
At any  time, a sy mptom -directed ph ysical examination can be performed as deemed 
necessary  by the Investigator.
Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity VAS
At visits specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F, the Phy sician will rate global 
assessment of subject 's current disease activit y ranging from 0 to 100 independent of the 
subject 's self -assessment using the VAS, which consists of a horizontal 100 mm line abbvie

Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, the Phy sician Global 
Assessment of Disease Activity  will be completed by  the ph ysician at the next feasible 
visit.
TJC and SJC Assessment
TJC Assessment
An assessment of 68 joints ( Appendix H) will be done for tenderness b y pressure 
manipulation on phy sical examination at visits speci fied in Appendix Dand Appendix F.  
Joint pain/tenderness will be classified as:  present ("1" ), abse nt ("0"), replaced ("9 ") or no 
assessment ( "NA").
SJC Assessment
An assessment of 66 joints ( Appendix H) will be done by  directed phy sical examination at 
visits specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F.  The joints to be examined for swelling 
are the same as those examined for tenderness, except the hip joints are excluded.  Joint 
swelling will be classified as present ( "1"), absent ( "0"), replaced ("9") or no assessment 
("NA").
Any injected joints will be considered as " not assessed" (" NA") for 3 months from the 
time of the intra- articular injection.
If possible, the TJC and SJC should be performed by  an independent and blinded joint 
assessor who should not perform an y other stud y related procedures.
In order to minimize variability , the same independent joint assessor should evaluate the 
subject at each visit for the duration of the trial as much as possible.  A back -up 
independent joint assessor should be identified.  The independent join t assessors should abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2016 -000933 -37
69be a qualified medical professional (e.g., nurse, phy sician 's assistant, phy sician).  Any  
other joint assessor must be trained and competent in performing such assessments.  I t is 
the responsibility  of the Investigator to ensure that all assessors are qualified and trained 
to perform joint assessments.  If the independent assessor is not available, the pre -
identified back -up assessor should perform such assessments.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, the TJC and SJC 
will be 
performed at the next feasible visit by the independent joint assessor, if possible .
CDAI
The CDAI calculation is required to determine if a subject fails to achieve low disease 
activity  and will be performed at the Week 28 visit.  An I nteractive Response Technology  
(IRT) will calculate CDAI with input from site personnel on joint counts and the subject 's 
and phy sician 's Global Assessment PtGA and phGA) of R A Disease Activity  score.
The calculation used to determine CDAI score at Week 28 is as follows:  
CDAI  = TJC28 + SJC28 + PtGA (cm) + PhGA (cm)
NOTE:  Investigator should optimize background RA therapies (as rescue) in subjects 
who failed to achieve a 20% reduction in both tender and swollen joint count.
Pregnancy Test
A serum pregnancy  test will be performed for all women of childbearing potential at the 
Screening Visit.  The serum pregnancy  test will be sent to and performed by  the central 
laboratory .  Ifthe serum pregnancy  test is positive the subject is considered a screen 
failure.  If the serum pregnancy  test is borderline, it should be repeated ≥ 3 day s later to 
determine eligibility .  If the repeat serum pregnancy  test is:
●
Positive, the subject is co nsidered a screen failure;
●Negative, the subject can be enrolled into the trial;abbvie 
Upadacitinib

70●Still borderline ≥ 3 days later , this will be considered documentation of 
continued lack of a positive result and the subject can be enrolled into the trial 
in the absence of clinical suspicion of pregnancy  and other pathological causes 
of borderline results .
In Period 1, a urine pregnancy  test will be performed for all women of childbearing 
potential at the Baseline Visit prior to the first dose of study  drug and at all subse quent 
visits.  More frequent pregnancy  tests will be performed throughout the study  if required 
per local/country  requirements.
●If the baseline urine pregnancy  test performed at the site is negative, then 
dosing with study  drug may  begin.  If the baseline urine pregnancy  test 
performed at the site is positive, dosing with study drug must be withheld and 
a serum pregnancy  test is required.  The serum pregnancy  test will be sent to 
and performed b y the central laboratory.  If the serum pregnancy  test is 
negat ive, study  drug may be started.  If the serum pregnancy  test is positive, 
study  drug must be permanently  discontinued.  In the event a serum pregnancy  
test comes back borderline, a repeat test is required ( ≥ 3 day s later) to 
document continued lack of a po sitive result.
●If a urine pregnancy  test at post -baseline is positive, study  drug needs to be 
temporaril y discontinued and a serum pregnancy test is required.  The serum 
pregnancy  test will be sent to and performed by  the central laboratory .  If the 
serum pregnancy  test is negative, study  drug may  be restarted.  If the serum 
pregnancy  test is positive, study  drug must be permanently  discontinued.  In 
the event a serum pregnancy test comes back borderline, a repeat test is 
required ( ≥ 3 day s later) to docume nt continued lack of a positive result.
In Period 2, for women of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy  test will be performed 
at all visits and monthly  at home between scheduled study  visits.  The results of the 
monthly  at home tests will be communic ated to the site.  If a urine pregnancy  test is 
positive, the subject must stop dosing, return to the study  site and have blood drawn for a 
serum pregnancy  test that will be analy zed at the central laboratory .abbvie

71In the event a urine pregnancy  test may not be performed at the protocol specified visits
due to study  modifications related to a state of emergency or pandemic situation like 
COVID -19, it can be performed b y subjects at a local laboratory or it is possible for the 
Investigator to arrange a shipment from the study  site directly  to the subject 's home of 
urine pregnancy  test kits to have the urine pregnancy  test done at home (see 
Section 5.3.1.1 -Sub-Section "Study  Drug Dispensing, Dosing, and Compliance "for 
details). Home urine pregnancy  test should be performed monthly , regardless of ability  to 
obtain other laboratory  samples.
At each visit, the study  staff should review the pregnancy  avoidance recommendations 
with each woman of childbearing potential and document this discussion in the subject 's 
source records.
If during the course of the study  a woman becomes surgically  steril e or post -menopausal 
and complete documentation as described in Section 5.2.4 is available, pregnancy  testing 
is no longer required.
A pregnant or breastfeeding fe male will not be eligible for participation in this study  or 
continuation on study  drug.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Samples will be obtained for the clinical laboratory tests listed in Table 2.  Unscheduled 
clinical labs may  be obtained at an y time during the study  if deemed appropriate per 
Investigator 's discretion.  A certified central laboratory  will be utilized to process and 
provide results for the c linical laboratory  tests.  All abnormal laboratory  tests that are 
considered clinically  significant by  the Investigator will be followed to a satisfactory  
resolution.
The central laboratory  chosen for this study  will provide instructions regarding the 
collection, processing, and shipping of these samples.abbvie

72If travel restrictions or other changes in local regulations due to state of emergency  or 
pandemic situation like COVID -19prevent the subject from having blood drawn for 
laboratory  testing at the study  site, it is possible for the Investigator to arrange for subjects 
to have laboratory  work done at a local lab, hospital, or other facility  to ensure the safet y 
assessments are conducted per protocol. Local lab results should be obtained along with 
reference ranges and kept within the subjects 'source documentation.  Local lab results 
should be reviewed b y the investigator or designee as soon as possible and documented in 
the eCRF.
If laboratory  samples cannot be obtained, study  drug administration may  be continued 
provided labs have been obtained within the prior 3 months, the investigator has reviewed 
the laboratory  results and confirmed and discussed with the subject that there is no safet y 
concern for the subject to continue use of the study drug in the absence of current lab 
results.  The subject should be scheduled for laboratory  draws as soon as feasible and no 
later than the next scheduled visit in order to continue the study  drug administration.
If laboratory  results are not available within the pri or 3 months /two consecutive 12 -week 
intervals, study  drug dispensation is not allowed until the required laboratory  tests are 
completed to ensure the safet y assessments are conducted per protocol . 
Blood samples will be obtained for the laboratory  tests at visits specified in Appendix D
and Appendix F.  Blood draws should be performed only  after all questionnaires (HAQ 
DI, Patient' s Assessment of Pain, etc.), clinical assessments, and vital sign determinations 
are obtained.
For clinic visits where samples for serum chemistry tests are collected , subjects should be 
fasting (a minimum 8 -hour fast) whenever possible.  If a subject is not able to fast when 
necessary , due to unforeseen circumstances, the non- fasting status will be recorded in 
study  source documentation.
Urine samples will be obtained for urinal ysis testing at visits specified in Appendix Dand 
Appendix F.  The central laboratory  will be responsible for performing a macroscopic abbvie

analysis at the central laboratory .
For an y laboratory  test value outside the reference range that the Investigator considers to 
be clinically  significant, the Investigator should apply  the standard of care for medical 
evaluation and treatment per local guidelines:
●The Investigator will repeat the test to verify  the out -of-range value.
● The Investigator will follow the out-of-range value to a satisfa ctory  clinical 
resolution.

e. At Screening only.
f. If PPD not performed.
g. In Period 1, the central lab hsCRP results starting from Baseline (Day 1) will not be reported to the Sponsor, 
Investigator, study site personnel, and the subject.  Results of hsCRP may be blunted in subjects taking a JAK 
inhibitor, thereby limiting its clinical utility in the setting of a possible safety assessment or adverse event 
management.  Any local hsCRP or CRP tests should not be reported to the investigator until treatment allocation is 
unblinded or subject is known to be receiving upadacitinib.  In Period 2, the central lab h sCRP results will remain

h. At screening for female subjects < 55 years old AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history of 
permanent surgical sterilization (defined in Section 5.2.4 ) an FSH should be tested.
i. A urine pregnancy test will be performed for all female subjects of childbearing potential at the Baseline Visit p rior

test will be sent to and performed by the central laboratory.  If the serum pregnancy test is positive, study drug 
must be permanently discontinued.  In the event a pregnancy test comes back borderline, a repeat test is required.  
If a urine pregnancy test postbaseline is positive, study drug needs to be temporarily discontinued and a serum 
pregnancy test is required.  The serum pregnancy test will be sent to and p erformed by the central laboratory. If 
serum pregnancy test is negative, study drug may be restarted.  If the serum pregnancy test is positive, study drug 
must be permanently discontinued.
j. Anti-HIV Ab will be performed at Screening, unless prohibited b y local regulations.  The Investigator must discuss 
any local reporting requirements to local health agencies with the subject.  The site will report confirmed positive 
results to their health agency per local regulations, if necessary.  If a subject has a confirmed positive result, the 
Investigator must discuss with the subject the potential implications to the subject 's health and subject should 
receive or be referred for clinical care promptly.  A subject will not be eligible for study participation if test results 
indicate a positive HIV infection.  AbbVie will not receive results from the testing and will not be made aware of 
any positive result.
k. If needed to assess B cell counts in subjects who have discontinued rituximab, see Inclusion Criterion 7.
Hepatitis Screen
All subjects will be tested for the presence of HBV and HCV at Screening.
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV):
Subjects will be tested for the presence of HBV at screening using the following tests:
●HBs Ag (Hepatitis B surface antigen)abbvie

76●HBc Ab/anti -HBc(Hepatitis B core antibody )
●HBs Ab/anti -HBs (Hepatitis B surface antibody )
A positive result for HBs Ag will be exclusionary .
A negative result for HBs Ag will be tested (automatic reflex testing) for core antibodies 
(HBc Ab) and surface antibodies (HB s Ab).
●A negative test result for HBc Ab does not require HBV DNA PCR qualitative 
testing and the subject may  be enrolled ( Figure 3, Scenarios A and B).  For a 
subject who has had a HBV vaccination (should document in the medical 
history ), a positive test resul t for HBs Ab is expected and the subject may  be 
enrolled ( Figure 3, Scenario B).*
●A positive test result for HBc Ab requires HBV DNA PCR testing (automatic 
reflex testing) ( Figure 3, Scenarios C and D).
○
A positive result for HBV DNA or a result that exceeds detection 
sensitivity  will be exclusionary .
○A subject with a negative result for HBV DNA may be enrolle d.

77Hepatitis C Virus (HCV):
Blood samples for Hepatitis C serology  will be obtained at the Screening Visit.  A 
positive HCV Ab will trigger an HCV RNA test.  A subject will not be eligible for study  
participation if test results indicate active Hepatitis C ( HCV RNA detectable in an y 
subject with anti HCV Ab).
HIV
Subjects with HI V infection are excluded from study  participation.  HIV testing will be 
performed at Screening, unless prohibited by  local regulations.  The Investigator must 
discuss any  local report ing requirements to local health agencies with the subject.  The 
site will report confirmed positive results to their health agency  per local regulations, if 
necessary .  If a subject has a confirmed positive result, the I nvestigator must discuss with 
the subject the potential implications to the subject' s health and subject should receive or 
be referred for clinical care promptly .  A subject will not be eligible for study  
participation if test results indicate a positive HIV infection.  AbbVie will not rece ive 
results from the testing and will not be made aware of an y positive result.
Randomization/Drug Assignment
All Screening laboratory  results must be reviewed, signed, and dated b y the Principal 
Investigator or Sub -investigator prior to the Baseline Visit .  Subjects will not be enrolled 
into the study  if laboratory  or other Screening result abnormalities are deemed clinically  
significant b y the Principal I nvestigator or Sub -investigator.
Subjects will be eligible for randomization if they  continue to meet all of the selection 
criteria (Section 5.2) at Baseline and are willing to continue in the study .
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using i nteractive response technology  (IRT) to 
receive double -blind study  drug in one of the following treatment groups:
●Group 1:  upadacitinib 15 mg QD, N = 275(Period 1) 
●Group 2:  Abatacept, N = 275(Period 1)abbvie

2 biologics of the same class; stratum 2:  failed multiple classes of biologics or 
≥ 3 biologics of the same class) and geographic region.  Once 35% of the total subjects 
have been randomized in stratum 2, further sc reening of subjects who meet stratum 
2criteria may  be suspended.  Once 20% of total subjects have been randomized who have 
not completed > 3 months of methotrexate, further screening of such methotrexate 
inexperienced subjects may  be suspended.
See Sectio n 5.5.3 for details.
Study Drug Dispensing, Dosing, and Compliance
Study  drug will be dispensed to subjects beginning at Baseline (Day  1) and as specified in 
Appendix Dand Appendix F.  The first dose of study drug will be administered a fter all 
other Baseline (Day  1) procedures are completed.  Subjects will maintain a dosing diary  
for all study  drug administered outside of the study  visit (i.e., at home) to capture dosing 
dates and times.  At visits specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F, the site personnel 
will review and r etain a copy  of the dosing diary , returned study  drug kits, and empty  
study  drug packaging to verify  compliance.
All relevant dosing information will be entered into the eCRF at each visit.  (Refer to 
Section 5.5for additional information).
Study  drug may  be shipped from the study  site directly  to the study  subject 's home due to 
study  modifications related to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -
19 
if all the following criteria are met:
●Direct -to-patient (DTP) shipment of study  drug is allowed by  local regulations 
and the relevant ethics committee
●Subject agrees to have the study  drug shipped directly  to their home
●Shipments m ay also include other study  supplies (e.g., drug dosing diaries, in-
home urine pregnancy  test kits,).  I nstructions will be provided b y AbbVie as 
to how a study  site can initiate a DTP shipment using Marken, a global vendor abbvie

the labeled storage conditions.  Signature is required upon deliv ery; due to 
COVID -19 related social distancing, this may  be provided by  the courier after 
delivery .  Documentation of the shipment is to be retained b y the clinical site.
●AbbVie will not receive subject identify ing information related to these 
shipments, a s the site will work directl y with the courier.
The study  site is responsible for meeting IRB/IEC reporting requirements related to DTP 
shipments of study  drug, and for obtaining consent to provide delivery  information to the 
courier and documenting this consent in source documents.
Optional Home Healthcare Service Due to State of Emergency or Pandemic 
Situation like COVID -19
Subjects may  be offered the option of home healthcare visits provided by  a study  nurse or 
third- party vendor.  Study procedures conducted in the home setting may  include vital 
signs and bod y weight, physical exam, blood and urine samples collection, urine 
pregnancy  test, adverse event and concomitant therapy  assessment including compliance 
to contraception requirements if applicabl e, latent TB risk assessment form, review of 
subject dosing diary , TJC and SJC performed by  the same independent joint assessor, if 
possible, to minimize variability .
This option can only  be offered in countries and sites that comply  with local regulatory  
and I RB/IEC requirements for homecare.  Any  pre-requisite submissions or notifications 
to the site I RB/IEC and local competent health authority  should be made, and approvals 
must be obtained prior to implementation.
The investigator should be available via phone call if a consultation is necessary .abbvie

80It is recommended that medical personnel entering a subject 's home adhere to local health 
regulations during the COVID -19 pandemic, such as the use of Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE), as required.
If the home visits will not be performed by  site personnel, the site may  be responsible for 
selecting a vendor, contracting with a vendor, and for ensuring continued compliance with 
the terms of the Clinical Study  Agreement.
Individuals performing home visits need to be added to the delegation log.
5.3.1.2 Collection and Handling of Optional Samples for 
Exploratory  Research and Validation Studies
5.3.1.2.1 Optional Samples for Exploratory  Research and Validation 
Studies
In Period 1, subjects will have the option to provide samples for exploratory research and 
validation studies.  Subjects may  still participate in the study  even if they  decide not to 
participate in this optional exploratory  research/validation study .  The procedures for 
obtaining and documenting informed consent are disc ussed in Section 9.3.
Exploratory  research can help to improve our understanding of how individuals respond 
to drugs and our ability to predict whic h subjects would benefit from receiving specific 
therapies.  In addition, exploratory  research may  help to improve our understanding of 
how to diagnose and assess/monitor RA by  assessing associations between disease 
characteristics, outcomes data, and biom arkers of interest.
Validation studies, including those related to the development of potential in vitro 
diagnostic tests, may  be carried out retrospectively in order to assess associations between 
events of interest (i.e., efficacy  and/or safet y events) a nd candidate biomarkers.
AbbVie (or people or companies working with AbbVie) will store the exploratory  
research/validation studies samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to 
protect confidentiality .  The samples will be retained while research on upadacitinib (or abbvie 
Upadacitinib

81drugs of this class) or RA and related conditions continues, but for no longer than 
20years after the completion of the study .
All subjects are preferred to have been fasting for a minimum of 8 hours prior to sample 
collection.  If a subject is not able to fast when necessary , due to unforeseen 
circumstances, the non -fasting status will be recorded in study  documentation.  The 
following samples will be collected according to Appendix Efrom each subject who 
consents to provide samples for exploratory  research/validation studies:
● DNA samples for pharmacogenetic or epigenetic anal yses
● RNA samples for transcriptomic and/or epige netic anal yses
●Serum and plasma samples for s ystemic analy ses including, but not limited to, 
proteomics and metabolomics
Samples will be shipped to AbbVie or a designated laboratory  for DNA/RNA extraction, 
if applicable, and/or analyses or long -term stora ge.  I nstructions for the preparation and 
shipment of the samples will be provided in the laboratory  manual.
5.3.2 Drug Concentration Measurements
5.3.2.1 Collection of Samples for A nalysis
Blood samples for assay  of upadacitinib will be collected as follows:
●Week 2 prior to dosing;
●Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24/PD at any  time during the visit.
On the Week 2 visit day, if possible, subjects should take the study drug dose at the clinic 
after collecting the PK blood sample, except if the subjects regularl y take the study  drug 
dose at night.  Those subjects who regularl y take the study drug dose at night should 
continue to take study  drug according to their normal schedule.  For all other visits, 
subjects can take the study drug dose on visit day s at their regular sch edule and not 
necessarily  at the clinic.abbvie

5.3.6.1 Exploratory  Research Variables and Validation Studies
Optional samples may  be collected to conduct exploratory  investigations into known and 
novel biomarkers.  The types of biomarkers to be anal yzed may  include, but are not 
limited to nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, or metabolites.
Biomarker assessments may  be used to assess and generate prognostic, predictive, or 
surrogate biomarker signatures.  These assessments may  be explored in the context of RA 
or related conditions and/or upadacitinib or drugs of similar classes.  The results from 
these anal yses are exploratory  in nature and may  not be included with the clinical study  
report.
The samples may  also be used to develop new therapies, research methods or 
technologies.  In addition, samples from this study may  be banked for future use.  
Samples may  then be used to validate putative biomarker signatures obtained from a 
prospective stud y, leading to the development of diagnostic tests.
5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy  or Assessment
5.4.1 Discontinuation of In dividual Subjects
Subjects can request to be discontinued from participating in the stud y at any time for an y 
reason including but not limited to disease progression or lack of response to treatment.  
The Investigator may  discontinue any  subject 's participation for an y reason, including an 
AE, safet y concerns, lack of efficacy, or failure to comply with the protocol.  See 
Section 6.1.7 for toxicity  management criteria.
Subjects will have study  drug discontinued immediately  if any  of the following occur:
●Clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  results or AEs, which rule out 
continuation of the study  drug, as determined b y the Investig ator or the 
AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director.abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2016 -000933 -37
87●Serious infections (e.g., sepsis) which cannot be adequatel y controlled within 
2weeks b y anti -infective treatment or would put the subject at risk for 
continued participation in the trial as determined by the Investigator.
● The Investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject.
●The subject requests withdrawal from the study .
●Inclusion or exclusion criteria violation was noted after the subject started 
study  drug, when continuation of the st udy drug would place the subject at risk 
as determined b y the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
● Introduction of prohibited medications or dosages when continuation of the 
study  drug would place the subject at risk, as determined by  the AbbVie 
Thera peutic Area Medical Director.
●Subject is non -compliant with TB proph ylaxis (if applicable) or develops 
active TB at any time during the stud y.
●The subject becomes pregnant while on stud y drug.
●Malignancy , except for localized NMSC or carcinoma in- situ of t he cervix.
●Subject is significantl y non -compliant with study  procedures which would put 
the subject at risk for continued participation in the trial as determined by  the 
Investigator or the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
●Subject develops a gastr ointestinal perforation (other than due to appendicitis 
or mechanical injury .)
●Confirmed diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus or non -
cardiac, non -neurologic arterial thrombosis.
●
Beginning at Week 12, subject has a TJC or SJC worse than base line at 
twoconsecutive visits (scheduled or unscheduled).
● Starting at Week 28 and thereafter, subject fails to show at least 20% 
improvement in TJC and SJC compared to baseline at 2 consecutive visits, 
despite optimization of background RA therapies.
●Starting at 28 weeks and thereafter, subjects who achieve ≥ 20% improvement 
in both TJC and SJC from baseline but fail to achieve CDAI ≤ 10 at 
twoconsecutive visits will be given the option, at the discretion of the 
investigator, either to continue or discont inue study  drug and be treated 
according to standard of care and at the discretion of the investigator.abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6

88In order to minimize missing data for efficacy  and safet y assessments, subjects who 
prematurel y discontinue study  drug treatment should continue to be followed for all 
regularl y scheduled visits, unless they have decided to discontinue the study participation 
entirely  (withdrawal informed consent).  Subjects should be advised on the continued 
scientific importance of their data even if they  discontinue t reatment with study  drug 
early.
If a subject is discontinued from study  drug, the procedures outlined for the Premature 
Discontinuation visit (PD visit) should be completed as soon as possible, preferabl y 
within 2 weeks of stud y drug discontinuation.  In a ddition, if subject is willing, a 30 -day 
(and 70 -day if within Period 1) follow -up phone call (or visit) after the last dose of study  
drug may  be completed to ensure all treatment emergent AEs/SAEs have been resolved.  
Subjects who discontinue the study  prematurel y after randomization will not be replaced.
All attempts must be made to determine the date of the last study  drug dose and the 
primary  reason for discontinuation of study  drug or study  participation.  The information 
will be recorded on the approp riate eCRF page.  However, these procedures should not 
interfere with the initiation of an y new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the 
Investigator feels are necessary  to treat the subject' s condition.  Following discontinuation 
of study  drug, the s ubject will be treated in accordance with the Investigator 's best clinical 
judgment irrespective of whether the subject decides to continue participation in the study .
During the COVID 19 pandemic, it has been necessary  to employ  mitigation strategies to 
enable the investigator to ensure subject safet y and continuity  of care. 
During a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19,the investigator 
should contact the sponsor medical contact before discontinuing a subject from the study
or study  drugfor a reason other than "planned per protocol,
"to ensure all acceptable 
mitigation steps have been explored.abbvie

89Lost to Follow -Up
For subjects to be considered lost to follow -up, reasonable attempts must be made to 
obtain information on the final status of the subject.  At a minimum, two phone calls must 
be made and one certified letter must be sent and documented in the subject' s source 
documentation.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may  terminate this study  prematurel y, either in its entirety or at any study  site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination.  The Investigator may  also terminate the study  at his/her site for reasonable 
cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance 
of the intended termination.  
Advance notice is not required by  either part y if the study is stopped due to safet y 
concerns.  If AbbVie terminates the study  for safety  reasons, AbbVie will immediately  
notify  the Investigator by telephone and subsequently  provide written instructions for 
study  termination.
5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Treatments A dministered
There are two active study  drugs in Period 1.  The first is daily  upadacitinib and the 
second is abatacept IV.
Upadacitinib, or matching placebo, will be taken orally  once dail y (QD), beginning on 
Day 1 (Baseline), and should be taken at approximately  the same time each day .  
Abatacept or placebo (0.9% Sodium Chloride I njection, or Solution for Infusion 100 mL ) 
will be administered b y intravenous infusion.  The study dr ug can be taken with or 
without food.  Subjects will continue their weekly  stable background therapy  of 
csDMARD(s).  AbbVie will not supply  csDMARD(s) (nor folic acid or equivalent, such 
as folinic acid, for subjects who are on MTX).abbvie

90Abatacept, or placebo (0.9% Sodium Chloride I njection, or Solution for Infusion 
100mL), will be given intravenousl y (IV) on Day 1, Week 2, Week 4, then every 4 weeks 
(q4) thereafter, with the last dose at Week 20.  Dosing for abatacept is as follows:  
< 60 kg:  500 mg; 60 –100kg:  750 mg; >100 kg:  1,000 mg.  The entire, fully  diluted 
abatacept solution should be administered over a period of 30 minutes and must be 
administered with an infusion set and a sterile, non- pyrogenic, low -protein -binding filter 
(pore size of 0.2 to 1.2 μm).  Abatacept requires reconstitution with sterile water as well 
as dilution prior to infusion with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or Solution for Infusion 
100 mL .  Sites are to follow the commercially  available preparation instructions for 
reconstit ution and dilution of abatacept and onl y use silicone -free s yringes.  AbbVie will 
supply  abatacept and the silicone -free s yringes.  Other preparation materials will be 
provided b y the sites.
The maltose that is contained in the abatacept formulation can in terfere with the readings 
of blood glucose monitors that use test strips with glucose deh ydrogenase 
pyrroloquinolinequinone (GDH- PQQ).  The GDH -PQQ based glucose monitoring 
systems may  react with the maltose present in abatacept, resulting in falsely  eleva ted 
blood glucose readings on the day  of infusion.  On study  visit day s where blinded 
abatacept is infused, patients that require blood glucose monitoring should be advised to 
consider methods that do not react with maltose, such as those based on glucose 
dehy drogenase nicotine adenine dinucleotide (GDH -NAD), glucose oxidase, or glucose 
hexokinase test methods.
Subjects will be dispensed with oral study drug QD (either upadacitinib 15 mg or 
matching placebo) and receive IV stud y drug infusions on Day  1, Wee k 2, Week 4, then 
q4 thereafter (either abatacept or matching placebo). 
Starting at Week 24 (after all assessments have been completed), subjects will be 
dispensed study  drug (upadacitinib 15 mg QD) in an open -label fashion until the 
completion of Period 2.abbvie

5.5.2.1 Packaging and Labeling
Upadacitinib and matching pl acebo will be packaged in bottles with quantities sufficient 
to accommodate stud y design.  Each kit label will contain a unique kit number.  This kit 
number is assigned to a subject via IRT and encodes the appropriate study  drug to be 
dispensed at the subject 's corresponding study  visit.  Each kit will be labeled as required 
per country  requirements.  L abels must remain affixed to the kits.  All blank spaces on the 
label will be completed by  the site staff prior to dispensing to the subjects.
Abatacept will be packaged 1 vial per kit.  Silicone -free s yringes will also be provided.  
Only  silicone -free s yringes should be used when preparing doses of abatacept.  Each kit 
label will contain a unique kit number.  This kit number is assigned to a subject via IRT 
and encodes the appropriate study  drug to be dispensed at the subject 's corresponding 
study  visit.  Each kit will be labeled as required per country requirements.  Labels must 
remain affixed to the kits.  All blank spaces on the label will be completed by  the site staff 
prior to dispensing to the subjects.
The commercially  sourced 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or Solution for Infusion 
(100 mL) will not be labeled as an Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) prior to the 
handling b y the unblinded pharmacist or qualified designee.  0.9% Sodium Chloride 
Injection or Solution for Infusion (100 mL) will instead be labeled with a blinded 
dispensing label b y the unblinded pharmacist or qualified designee as required.  
Dispensing labels must remain affixed to the m aterial.  If an IMP label on the 0.9% 
Sodium Chloride I njection or Solution for I nfusion is mandated by  local agencies, labels 
may be applied on the overwrap and will be removed by the unblinded pharmacist or 
qualified designee prior to administration.abbvie

935.5.2.2 Storage and Disposition of Study Drugs
Upadacitinib, or placebo, must be stored at controlled room temperature (15° to 25°C/59° 
to 77°F).  Abatacept must be stored at refrigerated temperature (2° to 8°C/36° to 46°F) 
and protected from light.  0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or Solution for Infusion should 
be stored per the locall y approved commercial label, SmPC or packaging insert.  Study  
drug must not be frozen at an y time.  The investigational products are for investigational 
use only  and are to be used only  within the context of this study .  The study drug supplied 
for this study  must be maintained under adequate securit y and stored under the conditions 
specified on the label until dispensed for subject use or destro yed as appropriate.
5.5.3 Method of Assignin g Subjects to Treatment Groups
All subjects will be randomized using I RT.  Before the study  is initiated, IRT directions 
will be provided to each site.
All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number b y the IRT at the Screening 
Visit.  For sub jects that re -screen, the Screening number assigned b y the IRT at the initial 
Screening visit should be used; a new Screening number should not be requested.
Subjects will be eligible for randomization if they  continue to meet all of the selection 
criteria (Section 5.2) at Baseline and are willing to continue in the study .
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using interactive response technology  (IRT) to 
receive double -blind study  drug in one of the following treatment groups:
●Group 1:  Upadacitinib 15 mg QD, N = 275 (Period 1)
●Group 2:  Abatacept approximately  10mg/kg IV, N = 
275(Period 1)
Randomization will be stratified b y number of prior bDMARD use (stratum 1:  failed 1 or 
2 biologics of the same class; stratum 2:  failed ≥ 3 biologics of the s ame class or failed 
biologics of multiple classes), and geographic region.  Once 35% of the total subjects 
have been randomized in stratum 2, further screening of subjects who meet stratum 2 abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2016 -000933 -37
94criteria may  be suspended.  Once 20% of total subjects have been randomized who have 
not completed > 3 months of methotrexate, further screening of such methotrexate 
inexperienced subjects may  be suspended.
The I RT will assign a randomization number that will encode the subject 's treatment 
group assignment according to the randomization schedule generated b y the Statistics 
Department at AbbVie.
IRT will provide the appropriate study  drug kit number(s) to dispense to each subject.  
Study  drug will be administered at the study  visits as summarized in Section 5.3.1.1 .  
Returned study  drug should not be re -dispensed to any subject.
5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Subjects should take study  drug as outline d in Section 5.5.1.
On dosing day s that occur on study  visit day s, subjects should follow the regular dosing 
schedule (refer to Section 5.3.2.1 regarding Week 2 visit).
Each subject 's dosing schedule should be closel y monitored by the site at each study  visit 
by careful review of the subject 's dosing diary .  This will ensure that all subjects enrolled 
into the study  maintain their original dosing schedule beginning with the first dose of 
study  drug (Baseline/Day 1).
If a subject should forget to take their upadacitinib (or matching placebo) dose at their 
regularl y scheduled dosing time, they should take the forgotten dose as soon as they  
remember the dose was missed as long as it is at least 10 hours before their next scheduled 
dose.  If a subject only  remembers the missed dose within 10 hours be fore next scheduled 
dose, the subject should skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the scheduled time.  
If the subject experiences a study  drug interruption for > 7 consecutive day s during 
Weeks 1 through 24 (Period 1) or > 30 consecutive day s after Week 24 (Period 2), they  
should notify  the Investigator, and the Investigator will determine if study  drug should be 
restarted.abbvie 
Upadacitinib

95In Period 1, the last dose of oral stud y drug should be taken the day  before the Week 24 
visit, and the last dose of intraven ous study  drug will be dispensed at the Week 20 visit.
5.5.5 Blinding
5.5.5.1 Blinding of Investigational Product
All AbbVie personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the trial 
(with the exception of AbbVie Drug Supply  Management Team and unblinded monitors 
conducting stud y drug accountability ), the Investigator, stud y site personnel, and the 
subject will remain blinded to each subject 's treatment throughout the study .  An 
unblinded pharmacist (or designated unblinded personnel) will be used for th e receiving 
and preparation of the blinded doses across the treatment groups.  Upadacitinib tablets 
(active and placebo) will be identical in appearance.  Upadacitinib study  drug will be 
delivered to the study drug preparation designee or pharmacist in a b linded label format.  
Abatacept and 0.9% Sodium Chloride I njection or Solution for I nfusion (if applicable) 
will be delivered to the unblinded study  drug preparation designee or unblinded 
pharmacist (or designated unblinded personnel) in an open -label for mat.  The unblinded 
pharmacist (or designated unblinded personnel) will prepare the dosing of abatacept, or 
placebo, (in a blinded manner) following the commerciall y available preparation 
instructions as appropriate based on the subject 's assigned treatmen t group and then 
provide to blinded site personnel.  The blinded site personnel will administer infusions to 
subjects.
The I RT will provide access to unblinded subject treatment information in the case of 
medical emergency .
In the event of a medical situat ion that requires unblinding of the stud y drug assignment, 
the Investigator is requested to contact the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director 
prior to breaking the blind.  However, if an urgent therapeutic intervention is necessary  
which warrants breaki ng the blind prior to contacting the AbbVie Therapeutic Area 
Medical Director, the Investigator can directl y access the I RT sy stem to break the blind abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2016 -000933 -37
96without AbbVie notification or agreement.  Unblinding is available in the IRT sy stem via 
the Unblind Subje ct transaction, which is available only  to the Investigator.  If the IRT 
system is unavailable, unblinding may  occur b y contacting EndPoint technical support via 
either phone (preferred) or email (support@endpointclinical.com).  For country -specific 
phone numbers, please see the following website:  http://www.endpointclinical.com/help -
desk/.  I n the event that the blind is broken before notification to the AbbVie Therapeutic 
Area Medical Director, we request that the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director be 
notified within 24 hours of the blind being broken.  The date and reason that the blind was 
broken must be convey ed to AbbVie and recorded on the appropriate eCRF.
An unblinded anal ysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed Period 1 
(Week 24).  Study  sites and subjects will remain blinded for the duration of Period 1.
5.5.5.2 Blinding of Data for Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC)
An external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) comprised of persons independent of 
AbbVie and with relevant expertise in their field will review unblinded safety data from 
the ongoing study.  The primary responsibility of the DMC will be to protect the safet y of 
the subjects participating in this study .
A separate DMC charter will be prepared outside of the protocol and will describe the 
roles and responsibilities of the DMC members, frequency of data reviews, and relevant 
safet y data to be assessed.
Communications from the DMC to the Study  Teams will not contain information that 
could potentially  unblind the team to subject treatment assignments.
As of September 2019, with all subjects having reached the end of Period 1, and after 
final review of unblinded safet y data, the DMC concluded its oversight of this study.abbvie

975.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The Investigator or his /her designated and qualified representatives will 
administer/dispense study drug onl y to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with 
the protocol.  The stud y drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the 
protocol.
Subject dosing will be recorded on a subject dosing diary .  Subjects will be instructed to 
return all drug containers (even if empty ) to the study  site personnel at each clinic visit.  
The study  site personnel will document compliance in the study  source documents.
5.5.7 Drug Accountability
The Investigator or his/her representative will verify  that study  drug supplies are received 
intact and in the correct amounts.  This will be documented by  signing and dating the 
Proof of Receipt or similar document and b y registering the a rrival of drug through the 
IRT.  The original Proof of Receipt Note and the IRT confirmation sheet will be kept in 
the site files as a record of what was received.
In addition, an I RT will be used to document investigational product accountability  
includin g but not limited to date received, the lot number, kit number(s), date dispensed, 
subject number, and the identification of the person dispensing the drug.
All empty /used study  drug packaging will be inventoried by  the site.  Empty /used study  
drug packagi ng should be returned by  the subject at each visit for accountability  and 
compliance purposes and new packaging issued as necessary .  Site staff will complete 
study  drug accountabilit y via I RT, by  using source documents, subject dosing diaries, and 
by visuall y inspecting the packaging whenever possible.  After drug accountability  and 
monitor reconciliation has been completed, used packaging and unused study  drug will be 
destroy ed on site according to local procedures or regulations or returned to the 
destruction depot b y the site staff (for those sites that do not meet AbbVie' s 
documentation requirements for on -site destruction).  The use of a third party  vendor for 
drug destruction must be pre-approved b y AbbVie.  For sites performing on -site drug abbvie

methodology  and date of destruction should be maintained at the site 's facility .
Monitors will reconcile the site 's processes, source documents, subject' s dosing diaries, 
IRT or site accountability  record, and destruction records to assure site compliance.
5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study  Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study  Design and Choice of Control Groups
This study  includes two periods:
Period 1 is a 24 -week, randomized, doubl e-blind, active -treatment period to compare 
safet y and efficacy of upadacitinib versus abatacept in subjects with moderately to 
severel y active RA who have an inadequate response to or intolerance to bDMARD 
therap y (EXCEPT abatacept) and who are on a stabl e dose of csDMARDs.  Period 1 is 
designed to test non- inferiority  of upadacitinib versus abatacept for achieving the primary  
endpoint change from baseline in DAS28(CRP) at Week 12, and other secondary  efficacy  
parameters.  Although primary  outcome will be assessed at Week 12, the blinded 
comparator stud y will continue until Week 24. 
All subjects initially  assigned to abatacept will have the option to enter Period 2 and to 
receive upadacitinib from Week 24 onwards.  Previous studies with both upadacitinib a nd 
abatacept have demonstrated robust and statistically  significant improvement in disease 
activity  at 12 week compared to placebo with moderate additional improvement observed 
with abatacept at 24 compared to 12 weeks.  In a clinical trial with Abatacept in a TNF 
inadequate responder population, near -maximal improvements were noted at Week 12 
(abatacept SmPC),17and thus comparison of upadacitinib to Abatacept at Week 12 should 
be a valid reflection of relative efficacy  of upadacitinib vs. Abatacept.  Durability  of the 
comparison will be performed at 24 weeks as a secondary  outcome.abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2016 -000933 -37
99Starting at Week 12 (af ter the 12 Week assessment), if subjects do not show a 20% 
improvement in tender and swollen joint count two consecutive visits, then they  will be 
rescued per Section 5.2.3.3 .  
Subjects not responding to therap y can discontinue study drug (or withdraw from study) 
at an y time for an y reason during the stud y in order to receive standard of care.  For 
subjects who demonstrate no response to therap y beginning at Week 12 through the 
period prior to Week 24, discontinuation of study  drug is advised for subjects who 
demonstrate worsening of TJC or SJC from baseline on 2 consecutive visits.  If at 
28weeks, subjects fail to achieve ≥ 20% improvement from base line in both TJC and SJC 
at two consecutive visits, study  drug should be discontinued.  Beginning at 28 weeks, 
subjects who achieve ≥ 20% improvement in both TJC and SJC but who fail to achieve a 
CDAI  ≤ 10 at two consecutive visits, the option will be give n, at the discretion of the 
investigator, either to continue study  drug or discontinue study  drug and initiate standard 
of care as determined b y the investigator.
The purpose of Period 2 is to evaluate the long- term safet y, tolerability, and efficacy of 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD in subjects with RA who have completed Period 1.  Subjects will 
continue to receive upadacitinib 15 mg QD in an open -label manner.
Starting with Amendment 5, all subjects will receive upadacitinib 15 mg, including those 
currentl y on upa dacitinib 30 mg, QD.
5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard statistical, clinical, and laboratory  procedures will be utilized in this study .  All 
efficacy  measurements in this study  are standard for assessing disease activity  in subjects 
with RA.  All cl inical and laboratory  procedures in this study  are standard and generally  
accepted.abbvie

1005.6.3 Suitability  of Subject Population
The intended stud y population is moderatel y to severel y active RA patients who have had 
an inadequate response to or intolerance to prior bDMARD treatment.  Key  entry  criteria 
are to enroll adult female and male subjects who are at least 18 years of age with a 
diagnosis of RA for ≥ 3 months who also fulfill the 2010 ACR/EUL AR classification 
criteria for RA.  Eligible study  subjects must have ≥ 6 swollen joints (based on 66 joint 
counts) and ≥ 6 tender joints (based on 68 joint counts) at Screening and Baseline Visits, 
and hsCRP level ≥ 3 mg/L (above ULN, central lab) at Screening.  Subjects who have 
been treated ≥ 3 months prior to the screen ing visit with ≥ 1 bDMARD therapy, but 
continue to exhibit active RA or had to discontinue due to intolerability  or toxicity , 
irrespective of treatment duration AND have never received abatacept may  be enrolled.  
Subjects must have been on a stable backgro und of csDMARD therapy  (restricted to 
MTX, chloroquine, h ydrox ychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or leflunomide) for ≥ 4 weeks 
prior to the first dose of study  drug.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
One dose of the once -daily  formulation of upadacitinib will be e valuated:  upadacitinib 
15mg QD.  The dose selection in this study  is based on anal yses of data from two Phase 2 
studies in RA subjects (Studies M13- 537 and M13-550) as well as results from the 
firsttwo Phase 3 studies in the RA program:  Study M13 -549 ( csDMARD -IR) and 
Study M13 -542 (bDMARD -IR).  The dose selected for Study  M15 -925, upadacitinib 
15mg QD, dosed for up to 216 weeks, is expected to be efficacious with an acceptable 
safet y profile.
Results from Studies M13 -549 (csDMARD -IR) and M13- 542 (bDMAR D-IR) showed 
that both the 15 and 30 mg QD doses of upadacitinib achieved superior responses to 
placebo for all primary  and ranked secondary  endpoints at Week 12 and demonstrated a 
safet y profile consistent with the known profile of upadacitinib from Phase 2 studies.  
Therefore, upadacitinib 15 mg was selected for comparison to abatacept in this Phase 3 abbvie

6.0 Complaints
A Complaint is any  written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies 
related to the ph ysical characteristics, identity , quality , purit y, potency, durability , 
reliability , safet y, effectiveness, or performance of a product/device after it is released for 
distribution.
Complaints associated with any  component of this investigational product must be 
reported to the Sponsor (Section 6.2.2 ).  For AEs, please refer to Section 6.1.  For product 
complaints, please refer to Section 6.2.
6.1 Medical Complaints
The Investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory  evidence of AEs on 
a routine basis throughout the study .  The Investigator will assess and record any  AE in 
detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/s ymptom, severity , 
time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the AE to study drug, and 
any action(s) taken.  For SAEs considered as having "no reasonable possibility "of being 
associated with st udy drug, the Investigator will provide other cause(s) of the event.  For 
AEs to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severit y.  AEs, 
whether in response to a query , observed by  site personnel, or reported spontaneously  by 
the subject will be recorded.
All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory  conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily  have a abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2016 -000933 -37
102causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigati onal) product, whether or not 
the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or dr ug withdrawal.  An y 
worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an AE.  Worsening in 
severit y of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE.  Laboratory abnormalities and 
changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only  if they  result in discontinuation from 
the study  drug, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator 
considers them to be AEs.
An elective surgery /procedure scheduled to occur during the study  will not be considered 
an AE if the surgery /procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the 
surgery /procedure has been pre- planned prior to study  entry .  However, if the pre -existing 
condition deteriorates unexpectedly  during the study  (e.g., surgery  performed earlier than 
planned), t hen the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery /procedure 
is being done will be considered an AE.
6.1.1.2 Serious A dverse Events
If an AE meets an y of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as an SAE 
within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE.
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality  if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have 
been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2016 -000933 -37
103Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for an y 
length of time or prolongs the subject 's hospital stay .  This 
does not include an emergency  room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility .
Congenital Anomaly An anomal y detected at or after birth, or an y anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially  
interferes with the activities of daily  living of a study  subject.  
Disability  is not intended to include experiences of relativel y 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea , influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but 
based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any  
of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, 
life-threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of 
hospitalization, cong enital anomal y, or persistent or 
significant disability /incapacity ).  Additionally , any  elective 
or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an 
important medical event.  Examples of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive trea tment in an 
emergency  room or at home, blood dy scrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
6.1.1.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest

105For relationship assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possib ility of being 
related to the stud y drug will be considered "associated. "Events assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated. "
In addition, when the investigator has not reported a relation ship or deemed it not 
assessable, AbbVie will consider the event associated.
If an Investigator 's opinion of no reasonable possibility of being related to study  drug is 
given, an Other cause of event must be provided by  the investigator for the serious 
adverse event.
6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All AEs reported from the time of study  drug administration until up to 70 day s following 
discontinuation of study  drug administration (depending on if discontinuation occurs in 
Period 1 or Period 2) have elapsed will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously  
reported b y the subject.  Subjects who discontinue study  drug treatment but continue to 
participate in the stud y will have SAEs and nonserious AEs collected for the remainder of 
study  participation.  I n addition, SAEs and protocol -related nonserious AEs will be 
collected from the time the subject signed the study -specific informed consent.

study  drug and the pregnancy  will be followed to outcome.
Pregnancy  in a study  subject is not considered an AE.  The medical outcome for either 
mother or infant, meeting any  serious criteria including an elective or spontaneous 
abortion, is considered an SAE and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the 
site becoming aware of the event.
Subjects should avoid pregnancy  throughout the course of the study , starting with the 
Screening Visit through 98 day s (Period 1)/30 days (Period 2) after the last study  drug 
administration. Results of a positive pregnancy  test or confirmation of a pregnancy  will 
be assessed starting with the Screening Visit through the final study  visit.  
6.1.7 Toxicity  Management
The toxicity  management of the AEs including AEs of special interest consists of safet y 
monitoring (review of AEs on an ongoing basis, and periodical/ad hoc review of safet y 
issues by  a safet y data monitoring committee), interruption of stud y drug dosing with 
appropriate clinical management if applicable, and discontinuation of the subjects from 
study  drug.  The management of specific AEs and laboratory  parameters is described 
below.
For subjects who discontinued study  drug but continued study  participation and are on 
standard of care therapies, these toxicity  management requirements do not apply  
(including alerts from the central lab) and an y intolerability  to standard of care therapies 
should be managed b y the prescribing ph ysician.
Infusion Reactions (according to package insert for Abatacept):   Acute infusion -
related events (adverse reactions occurring within 1 hour of the start of the infusion) were 
more common in the abatacept -treated patients than placebo -treated patients (9.4% for 
abatacept, 7.2% for placebo).  The most frequently reported events with abatacept (1 –
2%) were dizziness, headache, and h ypertension.  Acute infusion -related events that were 
reported in > 0.1% and ≤ 1% of patients treated with abatacept included cardiopulmonary  abbvie

110symptoms such as hy potension, increased blood pressure, decreased blood pressure, and 
dyspnea; other s ymptoms included nausea, flushing, urticaria, cough, h ypersensitivity , 
pruritus, rash, and wheezing.  Most of these reactions were mild to moderate.  The 
occurrence of anaph ylaxis remained rare between the double blind and long- term open-
label experience.  Hy persensitivity  was reported uncommonly .  Other reactions potentially  
associated with h ypersensitivity  to the medicinal product, such as h ypotension, urticaria, 
and dy spnea, that occurred within 24 hours of abatacept infusion, were uncommon.  I f any  
serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, intravenous abatacept therapy  should be 
discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy  initiated, and the use of abatacept 
should be permanentl y discontinued.
Serious Infections:   Subjects should be closel y monitored for the development of signs 
and sy mptoms of infection during and after treatment with study  drug.  Study  drug should 
be interrupted if a subject develops a serious infection or an opportunistic infection.  A 
subject who develops a new infection during treatment with study  drug should undergo 
prompt diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised subject.  As 
appropriate, antimicrobial therap y should be initiated, and the subject should be c losel y 
monitored.  Study  drug may  be restarted once the infection has been successfully  treated.  
Subjects who develop active TB or experience Hepatitis B reactivation must be 
discontinued from study  drug.
COVID -
19:  Interrupt study  drug in subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. 
Consider interrupting study  drug in subjects with signs and/or s ymptoms and suspicion of 
COVID -19.  The COVID-19 eCRF must be completed.
Herpes zoster:   If a subject develops herpe s zoster, consider temporaril y interrupting 
study  drug until the episode resolves.
Gastrointestinal Perforation:   If a diagnosis of gastrointestinal perforation is confirmed 
(other than appendicitis or penetrating injury ), the subject must be permanently  
discontinued from study  drug.abbvie

111Cardiovascular Events (MACE):   Subjects presenting with potential cardiovascular 
events should be carefully  monitored.  These events will be reviewed and adjudicated by  
an independent Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee in a blinded manner.
Thrombosis Events: Subjects who develop s ymptoms of thrombosis should be promptly  
evaluated and treated appropriatel y.  If the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary
 
embolus or non -cardiac, non -neurologic arterial thrombosis is confi rmed, the subject 
should be discontinued from study  drug .
Malignancy:   Subjects who develop malignancy other than NMSC or carcinoma in situ 
of the cervix must be discontinued from study  drug.  Information including 
histopathological results should be queri ed for the confirmation of the diagnosis.   Periodic 
skin examination is recommended for subjects who are at increased risk of skin cancer.
ECG Abnormality:   Subjects must be discontinued from study  drug for an ECG change 
considered clinically  significant a nd with reasonable possibility  of relationship to study  
drug OR a confirmed absolute QTcF value > 500 msec.
Management of Select Laboratory Abnormalities:   For an y given laboratory 
abnormality , the Investigator should assess the subject, appl y the standard of care for 
medical evaluation and treatment following an y local guidelines.  Specific toxicity  
management guidelines for abnormal laboratory values are described in Table 4and may  
require an appropriate supplemental eCRF be completed.  All abnormal laboratory  tests 
that are considered clinically  significant b y the Investigator will be followed to a 
satisfactory  resolution.  If a repeat test is requir ed per Table 4, the repeat testing must 
occur as soon as possible.abbvie

Subjects who meet any of the above criteria should be evaluated for an 
alternative etiology of the ALT or AST elevation and managed as medically 
appropriate.  If applicable, the alternative etiology should be documented in 
the eCRF.  If ALT or AST values r eturn to the normal reference range or its 
Baseline value, study drug may be restarted.  If restarting study drug, 
documentation should include reason that rechallenge is expected to be 
safe.  If after clinically appropriate evaluation, no alternative etio logy for 
ALT or AST elevation is found or the ALT or AST elevation has not 
resolved or is not trending down toward normal, the subject should be 
discontinued from study drug.
For any confirmed ALT or AST elevations > 3 ULN, complete

change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) at Week 12.abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2016 -000933 -37
121Analy sis of the primary  endpoint will be conducted on the FAS based on treatment as 
randomized.  The mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be reported for each 
treatment group.
Between -group comparison of upadacitinib and abatacept will be performed using the 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment as the fixed factor, and the 
corresponding baseline value and the main stratification factors as the covariates.  The 
non-inferiorit y of upadacitinib to abatacept on change from baseline in DAS28(CRP) at 
Week 12 will be evaluated against a non -inferiority  margin of 0.6 using the 95% 
confidence interval (CI) of treatment difference from the ANCOVA model.  The margin 
of 0.6 was derived considering both the meta -analy sis of placebo- subtracted effect of 
biologics in DAS28 on biologic -inadequate responder populations as well as the EULAR 
response criteria of "no response " for no clinically meaningful change.
For the primary  anal ysis, multiple imputation will be used.  The anal ysis will be repeated 
using Observed Cases (OC).  Supportive analysis will also be conducted on the Per 
Protocol Analy sis Set.
Treatment difference together with its 95% CI  on the primary  endpoint will be 
summarized in dem ographic subgroups including age, gender, weight, body mass index, 
race, and geographical region to assess the consistency of the treatment effect.  Additional 
subgroup summaries based on baseline disease characteristics and stratification factors 
will also be conducted.  However, no formal non -inferiority  comparison will be 
performed at subgroup level.
8.1.4.1.2 Key Secondary  Efficacy  Variables
Key secondary  endpoints are listed in Section 5.3.3.1.2 .
For the binary  endpoint proportion of subjects achieving Clinical Remission (CR), 
frequencies and percentages will be reported for each treatment group.  Comparison of 
upadacitinib to abatacept will be conducted us ing the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test 
adjusting for main stratification factors.abbvie

122For the continuous endpoint change from baseline in DAS28(CRP), the mean, standard 
deviation, median, and range will be reported for each treatment group.  Superiority  of 
upada citinib to abatacept on change from baseline in DAS28(CRP) at Week 12 will also 
be evaluated based on the same ANCOVA model as in the non -inferiorit y comparison.
See Section 8.1.4.1.5 for imputation methods.
8.1.4.1.3 Other Efficacy  Variables
Additional efficacy  variables are listed in Section 5.3.3.1.3 and will be summarized for all 
visits, including visits bey ond Week 24.  For binary  endpoints, frequencies and 
percentages will be reported for each treatment group.  For continuous endpoints, the 
change from baseline mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be reported for 
each treatment group.
8.1.4.1.4 Multiplicity  Control for Primary  and Key Secondary  
Endpoints
In order to preserve Ty pe I error, a step- down approach will be used to test the primary  
and key  secondary  endpoints where statistical significance can be claimed for a lower 
ranked endpoint onl y if the previous endpoint in the sequence meets the requirements of 
significance.  
8.1.4.1.5 Imputation Methods
The following methods will be used for missing data imputation:
Observed Cases (OC):   The OC anal ysis will not impute values for missing evaluations, 
and thus a subject who does not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit will be excluded 
from the OC anal ysis for that visit.
Multiple Imputation (MI):   The M I anal ysis imputes missing data multiple times under 
appropriate random variation and thus generates multiple imputed "pseudo- complete "abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2016 -000933 -37
123datasets.  Results will be aggregated across the multiple imputed datasets, overcoming 
drawbacks of the single imputation methods.
Non-Responder Imputat ion (NRI):   NRI applies to binary  endpoints only.  I n NRI 
analysis, subjects who prematurel y discontinue study  drug will be considered 
non-responders after discontinuation.
The NRI approach will serve as the primary  anal ysis approach for key binary endpoin ts.  
The MI approach will serve as the primary  anal ysis approach for key
 continuous 
endpoints.  Sensitivity  analy ses based on OC will also be conducted for key  endpoints.
8.1.4.2 Long -Term Efficacy  Analysis for Period 1 and Period 2 
Combined
The efficacy  endpoints of long -term efficacy  analy sis are listed in Section 5.3.3.2 and will 
be summarized for all visits.
Long -term efficacy  by time point will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  For 
binary  endpoints, frequencies and percentages will be summarized.  For continuous 
endpoints, the mean and standard deviation will be reported.
8.1.5 Safety  Analyses
8.1.5.1 General Considerations
Safety  anal yses will be carried out using the Safety  Analy sis Set.  Anal yses will be 
conducted for Period 1 alone, as well as for Period 1 and Period 2 combined.
Safety  anal yses are based on treatments actually  received.  Safety  will be assessed by  
AEs, phy sical exam ination, laboratory  assessments, ECG, and vital signs.  Frequency

laboratory  valu es from baseline to defined time points will be tabulated.
Missing safet y data will not be imputed.
8.1.5.2 Analysis of Adverse Events
Unless otherwise specified, the following conventions apply for both the Period 1 safet y 
analysis and the combined safet y analysi s of Period 1 and Period 2.
8.1.5.2.1 Treatment -Emergent A dverse Events (TE AE)
AEs will be coded using MedDRA.  A TEAE is defined as AE that began or worsened in 
severit y after initiation of study drug.
AEs starting more than 70 day s following the last dose of study drug for subjects on 
abatacept and AEs starting more than 30 day s following the last dose of study  drug for 
subjects on upadacitinib will not be included in summaries of TEAEs.  For subjects who 
continued into Period 2, AEs that are reported in Period 2 will be captured in the 
combined safet y analysis of Period 1 and Period 2.  
As a general safet y summary, the number and percentage of subjects experiencing TEAEs 
will be summarized for each treatment group for the following AE categories:
● All AEs;
●All seve re AEs;
●All reasonabl y possibly related AEs;
●All SAEs;
● Frequent AEs (reported in 2% of subjects or more in any  treatment group);

126The laboratory  data will be categorized as Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, and Grade 4 
according to OMERACT criteria (Rheumatology  Common Toxicity  Criteria v.2.0).  For 
creatinine phosphokinase, serum creatinine, and parameters that are not covered in the 
OMERACT criteria, NCI CTC criteria will be used.  The shift tables will tabulate the 
number and percentage of subjects with baseline and post -baseline values by grade levels.
Listings will be provided for potentially  clinically  significant laboratory  values and vital 
signs.
8.1.6 Pharmacokinetic and Exposure -Response A nalyses
Individual upadacitinib plasma concentrations at each study  visit w ill be tabulated and 
summarized with appropriate statistical methods.
Data from this study  may be combined with data from other studies for the population PK 
and exposure- response analy ses.  Population PK and exposure -response analy ses of onl y 
data from th is study  may  not be conducted.  The following general methodology  will be 
used for the population PK and exposure -response anal yses.
Population PK analy ses will be performed using the actual sampling time relative to 
dosing.  PK models will be built using a non -linear mixed -effects modeling approach with 
non-linear mixed - effects modeling (NONMEM) software (Version 7, or a higher version).  
The structure of the starting PK model will be based on the PK anal ysis of data from 
previous studies.  The CL/F and V/ F of upadacitinib will be the PK parameters of major 
interest in the anal yses.  If necessary , other parameters, including the parameters 
describing absorption characteristics, may  be fixed if useful in the anal ysis.
The evaluation criteria described below will be used to examine the performance of 
different models.
1. The objective function of the best model is significantly  smaller than the alternative 
model(s).abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2016 -000933 -37
1272. The observed and predicted concentrations from the preferred model are more 
randomly  distributed a cross the line of unity  (a straight line with zero intercept and 
a slope of one) than the alternative model(s).
3. Visual inspection of model fits, standard errors of model parameters and change in 
inter-subject and intra -subject error.
Once an appropriate b ase PK model (including inter -and intra -subject error structure) is 
developed, empirical Bay esian estimates of individual model parameters will be 
calculated b y the posterior conditional estimation technique using non -linear 
mixed -effects modeling.  The r elationship between these conditional estimates CL/F and 
V/F values with onl y potentially  physiologicall y relevant or clinically meaningful 
covariates (such as subject age, sex, body  weight, concomitant medications, laboratory  
markers of hepatic of renal f unction, etc.) will be explored using stepwise forward 
selection method, or another suitable regression/smoothing method at a significance level 
of 0.05.  After identification of all relevant covariates, a stepwise backward elimination of 
covariates from t he full model will be employ ed to evaluate the significance (at P< 0.005, 
corresponding to a decrease in objective function > 7.88 for one degree of freedom) of 
each covariate in the full model.
Linear or non -linear relationships of primary  PK parameters with various covariates will 
be explored.
Relationships between upadacitinib exposure and clinical observations (primary  efficacy  
variable) will be explored.  Exposure -response relationships for secondary  efficacy  
variables and/or some safety  measures of i nterest may  also be explored.  The relationship 
between exposure (e.g., population PK model predicted average concentrations, area 
under the curve, trough concentrations, the individual model -predicted PK profiles, or 
some other appropriate measure of expo sure) and drug effect will be explored.  Several 
classes of models (e.g., linear, log- linear, exponential, E max, sigmoid E max, etc.) will be 
evaluated to characterize the exposure -response relationship based on observed data.abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2016 -000933 -37
128Results of the PK and exposure- response analy ses may  be summarized in a separate report 
prior to regulatory  filing of upadacitinib for the treatment of RA, rather than in the CSR.
Additional analy ses will be performed if useful and appropriate.
8.1.7 Statistical A nalysis of Biomarker Data
Ifthe optional exploratory  research variables including an additional panel of prognostic, 
and predictive biomarkers are evaluated, then those data may  be anal yzed as follows.  The 
association of biomarkers to the efficacy  and safety  endpoints may  be explor ed for each 
biomarker one at a time, and also for combinations of biomarkers via some multivariate 
predictive modeling algorithms.  Optimal multivariate combinations of biomarkers that 
associate with efficacy  endpoints, subject response/non-response (with respect to 
appropriate clinical endpoints), and also with safety  endpoints may  be explored via a 
variet y of statistical predictive modeling algorithms.  Also cut -points for individual 
biomarkers and optimal combinations of biomarkers that differentiate the subject response 
with respect to efficacy /safet y endpoints may be explored.  The significance of these 
multivariate combinations of biomarkers may  be assessed via at least 20 iterations of 5 -
fold cross -validation.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
The planned 
total sample size of 550 (N = 275 per arm) can provide more than 90% 
power for the non- inferiority  assessment on the primary  endpoint using a non- inferiorit y 
margin of 0.6 at two -sided significance level of 0.05, assuming true difference between 
upadacitin ib and abatacept in change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) is 0.5 with an 
assumed standard deviation of 2.0 and accounting for a 10% drop rate.  Under the planned 
sample size, superiority  comparison of upadacitinib to abatacept in change from baseline 
in DAS28 (CRP) is powered at approximately  80%.  The planned sample size can also 
provide approximately  80% power for superiority comparison of upadacitinib to abatacept 
in DAS CR at two -sided significance level of 0.05 and accounting for a 10% dropout rate, 
wher e the assumed DAS CR response rate is 31% for upadacitinib and 20% abatacept.abbvie

1298.3 Randomization Methods
Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups:
●Group 1:  Upadacitinib 15 mg QD, N = 275(Period 1) 
● Group 2:  Abatac ept, N = 275 (Period 1)
Randomization will be stratified b y number of prior bDMARD use (stratum 1:  failed 1 or 
2 biologics of the same class; stratum 2:  failed ≥ 3 biologics of the same class or failed 
biologics of multiple classes) and geographic region.  Once 35% of the total subjects have 
been randomized in stratum 2, further screening of subjects who meet stratum 2 criteria 
may be suspended.  Once 20% of total subjects have been randomized who have not 
completed > 3 months of methotrexate, further sc reening of such methotrexate 
inexperienced subjects may  be suspended.
See Section 5.5.3for details.
9.0 Ethics
9.1 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or I nstitutional Review 
Board (IRB)
Good Clinical Practice requires that the clinical protocol, any  protocol amendments, the 
Investigator 's Brochure, the informed consent, and all other forms of subject information 
related to the stud y (e.g., advertisements us ed to recruit subjects) and any  other necessary  
documents be reviewed by an IEC/I RB.  The IEC/IRB will review the ethical, scientific 
and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted.  IEC/IRB approval of the 
protocol, informed consent, and subject information and/or advertising, as relevant, will 
be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a study  site.
Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/I RB approval and approval by  
Regulatory  Authority (ies), if required by  local law regulations, prior to implementation of 
any changes made to the study  design.  The investigator will be required to submit, abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2016 -000933 -37
130maintain and archive study  essential documents according to International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) GCP and all other applicable regulatory  requirements.
Any SAEs that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated by  local regulations, will be 
reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory  Agencies, as required b y 
local regulations.  During the conduct of the stud y, the I nvestigator should promptly  
provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports, and an y additional reports required 
by local regulations) to the IEC/I RB of any  changes that affect the conduct of the study  
and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation of the submission to the 
IEC/IRB should also be provided to AbbVie.
9.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, ICH guidelines, applicable 
regulations and guidelines governing clinical study conduct and the ethical principles that 
have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  Responsibilities of the clinical 
invest igator are specified in Appendix A.
In the event a significant disaster/crisis (e.g., epidemic/pandemic, natural disaster, 
conflict/combat) occurs leading to difficulties in performing protocol -specified 
procedures, AbbVie may engage with study  site personnel in efforts to ensure the safet y 
of subjects, maintain protocol compliance, and minimize risks to the integrity  of the stud y 
while try ing to best manage subject continuity  of care.  This may  include alternative 
methods for assessments (e.g., virtual site visits), alternative locations for data collection 
(e.g., use of a local lab instead of a central lab), and shipping investigational product 
and/or supplies direct to subjects to ensure continuity  of treatment where allowed.  In all 
cases, these alternative measures must be allowed by  local regulations and permitted by  
IRB/IEC.  Investigators should notify  AbbVie if any  urgent safet y measures are ta ken to 
protect the subjects against any  immediate hazard.abbvie

1319.3 Subject Information and Consent
The Investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study  to the 
subject, and answer all questions regarding this study .  Prior to an y stud y-related 
screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will 
be reviewed and signed and dated b y the subject, the person who administered the 
informed consent, and any  other signatories according to local requirements.  A c opy of 
the informed consent will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the 
subject 's medical record.  An entry  must also be made in the subject 's dated source 
documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to an y study -related 
procedures and that the subject received a signed copy .
Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation 
in the study  can be found in the informed consent.
Samples for exploratory  research/validation studies will only  be collected if the subject 
has voluntarily  signed and dated the separate written consent for exploratory  
research/validation studies, approved b y an IRB/IEC, aft er the nature of the testing has 
been explained and the subject has had an opportunity  to ask questions.  The separate 
written consent must be signed before the exploratory  research/validation studies samples 
are collected and testing is performed.  If the subject does not consent to the exploratory  
research/validation studies, it will not impact the subject' s participation in the study .
In the event a subject withdraws from the main study , optional exploratory  
research/validation samples will continue to b e stored and anal yzed unless the subject 
specificall y withdraws consent for the optional samples.  If consent is withdrawn for the 
optional sampling, the subject must inform their study  doctor, and once AbbVie is 
informed, the optional samples will be dest royed.  However, if the subject withdraws 
his/her consent and the samples have alread y been tested, those results will still remain as 
part of the overall research data.abbvie

Canada
Section 5.2.1 Inclusion Criteria
10. If female of childbearing potential, subject must be practicing two forms of 
contraception (one highly  effective method combined with one effective method, 
refer to Contrac eption Recommendations for Females below) that are effective 
from Study  Day  1 through at least 98 days (Period 1)/30 day s (Period 2) after the 
last dose of study  drug.
11. Male subjects who are sexually  active with female partner(s) of childbearing 
potential m ust agree from Study  Day  1 through 30 day s after the last dose of study  
drug to practice the protocol- specified contraception (refer to Contraception 
Recommendations for Males below).
Section 5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations
Contraception Recommendation for Females
A woman who is postmenopausal or permanentl y surgically  sterile (bilateral 
oophorectom y, bilateral salpingectomy or h ysterectomy ) is not considered to be a woman 
of childbearing potential and is not required to follow contraception recommendations.  
Postmenopausal is defined as:
●Age ≥ 55 y ears with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause; or
●Age < 55 years w ith no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause AND an FSH level > 40 mIU/mL.abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2016 -000933 -37
146If the female subject is < 55 y ears of age:
AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history  of permanent surgical 
sterilization (defined above), FSH should be tested at Screening.
● If FSH is not tested, it is assumed that the subject is of childbearing potential 
and protocol -specified contraception is required.
● If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with post- menopausal status, 
contraception is not required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with pre -menopausal status, 
contraception is required.
For a female subject at any  age:
● Female subject with menses within the past 12 months are of childbearing 
potential and F SH is therefore not required but contraception is required.
●Female subjects who are surgically  sterile (defined above) are not of 
childbearing potential and therefore no FSH testing or contraception is 
required.
A woman who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently  surgicall y 
sterile is considered of childbearing potential and is required to use two forms of 
contraception.  This includes one form of highl y effective contraception and one effective 
method of contraception that are effect ive from Study  Day  1 (or earlier) through at least 
98 day s (Period 1)/30 days (Period 2) after the last dose of study  drug.
●Highl y effective methods:
○Hormonal contraceptives started at least 2 months prior to randomization 
(e.g., combined [estrogen and progestogen containing] oral contraceptives, 
patch, vaginal ring, injectables, and implants);
○Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine s ystem (IUS);
○Vasectom y and tubal ligation.abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2016 -000933 -37
147●Effective methods:
○Barrier methods of contraception (e.g., male condom, female condom, 
cervical cap, diaphragm, contraceptive sponge).
○Note:  The proper use of diaphragm or cervical cap includes use of 
spermicide and is considered one barrier method.  The cervical cap and 
contraceptive sponge are less effective in parous women.  The use of 
spermicide alone is not considered a suitable b arrier method for 
contraception.  When used consistently  and correctly , "double barrier "
methods of contraception (e.g., male condom with diaphragm, male 
condom with cervical cap) can be used as an effe ctive alternative to the 
highl y effective contraception methods described above.  Male and female 
condoms should not be used together as they  can tear of become damaged.
Contraception Recommendation for Males
For a male subject who has a female partner wh o is postmenopausal or permanently  
sterile, no contraception is required.
A male subject who is sexually  active with female partner(s) of childbearing potential 
must agree from Study  Day  1 through 30 day s after the last dose of study  drug to practice 
contr aception with:
●Condom use and female partner(s) using at least one of the highly  effective 
contraceptive methods as defined in the protocol for female stud y subjects of 
childbearing potential.
Additionally , male subjects must agree not to donate sperm fro m Study  Day  1 through 
30days after the last dose of study  drug.
Male subjects are responsible for informing his partner(s) of the risk of becoming 
pregnant and for reporting an y pregnancy  to the study  doctor.  If a pregnancy  occurs, a 
partner authorizatio n form requesting pregnancy  outcome information will be requested 
from the pregnant partner.abbvie

150If required per local practices, male or female condom with or without spermicide OR 
cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide should be used in addition to one of the highly  
effective birth control methods listed above.
Contraception Recommendation for Males
There are no contraception requirements for male subjects receiving upadacitinib or their 
female partner(s.)
The concomitant csDMARDs (i.e., methotrexate, sulfasalazine, etc.) have been prescribed 
per standard of care prior to study  entry  and are allowed to be continued during the stud y.  
Contraception should continue while the subject is on the concomitant csDMARD(s) and 
that duration of contraception and the requirement not to donate sperm after 
discontinuati on of the csDMARD(s) should be based on the local label.abbvie

a. If a subject prematurely discontinues study participation (withdrawal of informed consent), the procedures outlined for the P remature Discontinuation visit (PD visit) should 
be completed as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of study drug discontinuation.
b. These visits are 30 and 70 days after last dose of study drug for those subjects who complete Period 1 and do NOT enter Perio d 2.  The 30 and 70 -day follow -up phon e call to 
determine the status of any ongoing AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs may be allowed for subjects who prematurel y discontinue from study and have 
completed the PD visit.
c. The Baseline visit procedures will serve as the reference for all subsequent visits with the exception of the ECG, which will be obtained at Screening only and used as the 
baseline reference.
d. Informed consent should be obtained at Screening prior to performing any study related procedures.
e. Document herpes z oster and hepatitis B vaccination status in medical history.abbvie

154f. Collect serious adverse events and protocol -related nonserious AEs that occur after a subject signs the informed consent, prior to the first dose of study drug.
g. Prior to other procedures.  For morning stiffness, duration will be captured only if NRS rating is > 0.
h. Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures TB Testing for specific requirements for TB testing and TB prophylaxis.
i. The chest x -ray will not be required if a subject had a previous normal chest -x-ray within 90 days of Screening, provided that all source documentation is available at the site 
(refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Chest X -Ray for specific requirements).
j. For subjects with a normal ECG taken within 90 days of Screening, a repeat ECG at Screening will not be requ ired, provided all source documentation is available.  Refer to 
Section 5.3.1.1 12-Lead ECG for additional details.
k. For subjects who do not ente r Period 2 or prematurely discontinue from the study, an ECG will be performed.
l. Blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate should be performed before blood draws are performed.
m. A full physical exam is required at the visits in dicated.  A symptom -
directed physical exam may be performed when necessary.
n. Starting at Week 12 and thereafter, subjects who do not achieve ≥ 20% improvement in both TJC and SJC compared to baseline at 2 consecutive visits, should receive rescue 
medicat ion as described in Section 5.2.3.3 .  Starting at Week 12 and thereafter, subjects who demonstrate worsening of joint count (SJC or TJC) from basel ine at 
2 consecutive visits should be discontinued from study drug and treated according to standard of care and at the disc retion of the clinician.
o. For all women of childbearing potential, collect serum for pregnancy test only at Screening.  If serum p regnancy test comes back borderline, a repeat test is necessary 
(pregnancy is an exclusion criterion).  Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures Pregnancy Test for additional details.
p. For all women of childbearing potential, collect urine for pregnancy test at Baseline and all subsequent visits.  If urine pr egnancy test (which is performed at the site) is 
negative, begin or continue dosing.  If ur ine pregnancy test is positive, withhold dosing and perform a serum pregnancy test.  Pregnant subjects must permanently disco ntinue 
study drug.  Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures Pregnancy Test for additional details.
q. In Period 1, the central lab hsCRP results starting from Baseline (Day 1) will not be reported to the Sponsor, Investigator, study site personnel, and the subject.  Results o f 
hsCRP may be blunted in subjects taking a JAK inhibitor, thereby limiting its clinical utility in the setting of a possible s afety assessment or adverse event management.  Any 
local hsCRP or CRP tests should not be reported to the investigator until trea tment allocation is unblinded or subject is known to be receiving upadacitinib.  In Period 2, the 
central lab hsCRP results will remain blinded to the Investigator, study site personnel, and the subject.   Starting with Amendment 5, at a timepoint specified by the Sponsor in 
Period 2, central laboratory hsCRP results will be reported to the Investigator/study site personnel.  After treatment assign ment is unblinded, local hsCRP or CRP tests are 
allowed.
r. Minimum 8 -hour fast.  If a subject is not able to fa st when necessary, due to unforeseen circumstances, the non -
fasting status will be recorded in study source documentation.
s. A urine dipstick macroscopic urinalysis will be completed by the central laboratory at all required visits.  A microscopic an alysis will be performed in the event the dipstick 
results show leukocytes, nitrite, protein, ketones, or blood greater than negative or glucose greater than normal.abbvie 
Upadacitinib
M15 -925 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2016 -000933 -37
155t. HIV testing will be performed at Screening, unless prohibited by local regulations.  The Investigator must discuss any local reporting requirements to local health agencies 
with the subject.  The site will report confirmed positive results to their health agency per local regulations, if necessary .  If the result is confirmed as positive, then the 
Investigator will discuss with the subject potential implications to the subject 's health and next steps.  If a subject has a confirmed positive result, the Investigator must discuss 
with the subject the potential implications to the subject 's health and subject should receive or be referred for clinical care promptly.  A subject will not be eligible for study 
participation if test results indicate a positive HIV infection.  AbbVie will not receive results from the testing and will n ot be made aware of any positive result.
u. FSH should be tested at Screening if the female subject is < 55 years of age AND has had no menses ≥ 12 months AND has no his tory of permanent surgical sterilization 
(defined in Section 5.2.4 ).
v. At Week 2 visits, PK samples should be collected prior to dosing and the subjects should take the study drug dose at the clin ic after collecting the PK blood sample.  
However, if the subject normally takes the study drug dose at a time that is after the time of the scheduled study visit, the subject should follow the regular dosing schedule 
and the PK sample should be collected at any time during the visit.
w. PK samples should be col lected at any time during the visit.  Subject should follow the regular dosing schedule.
x. Samples only collected if subject provides written consent.
y. For subjects entering Period 2 only.  Each subject will be dispensed one (1) bottle containing 100 ta blets (a 12 -week supply).  One (1) bottle of 100 tablets will be dispensed 
every 12 weeks for the remaining Period 2 visits.
Note: Visit window is ± 3 days for Period 1.  Any of the procedures may be performed at an unscheduled visit at the discretion of t he Investigator.  Subjects who 
choose to discontinue study drug treatment, but continue to participate in the study should follow the regular visit schedule and adhere to all study procedures 
except for dispensing study drug, PK sample collection, and bloo d sample collection for optional exploratory research and validation studies.abbvie

b. This visit is 30 days after last dose of study drug for those subjects who complete Period 2.  A 30 -day follow -up phone call may be allowed for subjects who have completed 
PD visit to determine the status of any ongoing AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs.
c. Starting at Week 28 and thereafter, study drug should be discontinued for subjects who fail to show at least 20% improvement in TJC and SJC compared to baseline at 
2 consecutive visits desp ite optimization of background RA therapies.  Starting at Week 28 and thereafter, subjects who achieve ≥ 20% improvement in b oth TJC and SJC but 
fail to achieve CDAI ≤ 10 at two consecutive visits will be given the option, at the discretion of the investig ator, whether to continue study or discontinue study drug and be 
treated with standard of care at the discretion of the investigator.
d. Prior to other procedures.  For morning stiffness, duration will be captured only if NRS rating is > 0.
e. TB testing s hould be performed every 48 weeks after Week 48 in subjects with previous negative TB test.  Subjects with new evidence of latent TB must initiate prophylactic 
treatment immediately per local guidelines.  Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 TB Testing/TB Prophylaxis for additional details.abbvie

159f. Obtain chest x -ray every 48 weeks after Week 48 for subjects with newly identified TB risk factors as determined by the TB risk assessment form, or for subjects living in 
areas endemic for TB, or for subjects with a newly positive TB test after baseline.
g. In addition to ECG assessments as indicated above, an ECG may be performed at any visit if deemed necessary by the Inv estigator.
h. Blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate should be performed before blood draws are performed.
i. A full physical exam is required every 24 weeks after Week 48.  A symptom -directed physical exam may be performed when necessary.
j. For all women of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed at all visits and monthly at home between scheduled study visits.  The results of the monthly 
at home tests will be communicated to the site.  If a urine pregn ancy test is positive, the subject must stop dosing, come in to the clinic and have blood drawn for a serum 
pregnancy test that will be analyzed at the central laboratory.  Pregnant subjects must permanently discontinue study drug.  Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures 
Pregnancy Test for additional details.
k. In Period 1, the central lab hsCRP results starting from Baseline (Day 1) will not be reported to the Sponsor, Investigator, study site personnel, and the subject.  Results of 
hsCRP may be blunted in subjects taking a JAK inhibitor, thereby limiting its clinical utility in the setting of a possible s afety assessment or adverse event managem ent.  Any 
local hsCRP or CRP tests should not be reported to the investigator until treatment allocation is unblinded or subject is kno wn to be receiving upadacitinib.  In Period 2, the 
central lab hsCRP results will remain blinded to the Investigator, stu dy site personnel, and the subject.   Starting with Amendment 5, at a timepoint specified by the Sponsor in 
Period 2, central laboratory hsCRP results will be reported to the Investigator/study site personnel.  After treatment assign ment is unblinded, local hsCRP or CRP tests are 
allowed.
l. Minimum 8 -
hour fast.  If a subject is not able to fast when necessary, due to unforeseen circumstances, the non -fasting status will be recorded in study source documentation.
m. Dipstick urinalysis will be completed by t he central lab at all required visits.  Specified abnormal macroscopic urinalyses defined as leukocytes, nitrite, protein, ke tones, or 
blood greater than negative, or glucose greater than normal will be followed up with a microscopic analysis at the centra l laboratory.
Note: Visit window is ± 7 days for Period 2.  Any of the procedures may be performed at an unscheduled visit at the discretion of t he Investigator.  Subjects who 
choose to discontinue study drug treatment, but continue to participate in the s tudy should complete a Premature Discontinuation Visit (PD Visit) as soon as 
possible, preferably within 2 weeks.  Refer to Section 5.1Discontinuation of Study Dr ug and Continuation of Study Participation (Period 1 and Period 2) for 
additional details.abbvie

Rheumatoid arthritis V2.0 (WPAI:RA)
The following questions ask about the effect of your rheumatoid arthritis on y our ability  
to work and perform normal daily  activities.  Please fill in the blanks or circle a number, 
as indicated. 
1. Are you currentl y employed (working for pay)? _____ NO ___ YES
If 'NO,'tick "NO"and skip to question 6.
The next questions refer to the past seven day s, not including today .
2. During the past 7 day s, how many  hours did y ou miss from work because of 
problems associ ated with y our rheumatoid arthritis ?  Include hours you missed on 
sick days, times you went in late, left early, etc., because of your rheumatoid 
arthritis.  Do not include time you missed to participate in this study.
______ HOURS
3. During the past 7 day s, how many  hours did y ou miss from work because of any  
other reason, such as annual leave, holiday s, time off to participate in this study ?
______ HOURS
4. During the past 7 day s, how many  hours did y ou actually  work?
______ HOURS (If "0,"skip to question 6.)
5. During the past 7 day s, how much did y our rheumatoid arthritis affect y our 
productivity  while you were working ?
Think about days you were limited in the amount or kind of work you could do, days you 
accomplished less than you would like, or days you could not do your work as carefully as 
usual.  If rheumatoid arthritis affected your work only a little, choose a low number.  
Choose a high number if rheumatoid arthritis affected your work a great deal. abbvie

6. During the past 7 day s, how much did y our rheumatoid arthritis problems affect 
your ability  to perform your regular daily  activities, other than work at a job?
By regular activities, we mean the usual activities you perform, such as working 
around the house, shopping, childcare, exercising, studying, etc.  Think about times 
you were limited in the amount or kind of activities you could perform and times 
you accomplished less than you would like.  If rheumatoid arthritis affected your 
activities only a little, choose a low number.  Choose a high number if rhe umatoid 
arthritis affected your activities a great deal.

* For CPK and Creatinine NCI CTC grading will be used.  For CPK therefore the following gradings apply:  Grade 1:  > ULN – 2.5 × ULN; Grad e 2:  > 2.5 –5.0 × ULN; 
Grade 3:  > 5.0 – 10.0 × ULN; Grade 4:  > 10.0 × ULN; For Creatinine the following gradings apply:  Grade 1:  > 1 – 1.5 × Baseline; > ULN –1.5 × ULN; Grade 2:  > 1.5 –
3.0 × Baseline; > 1.5 – 3.0 × ULN; Grade 3:  > 3.0 baseline; > 3.0 –6.0 × ULN; Grade 4:  > 6.0 × ULN.abbvie

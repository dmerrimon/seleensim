Study 191622-111 Analysis Plan 
GDD-BSP-T-001 v2012.5 4 1 Introduction 
This analysis plan details the analys es that will be performed for BOTOX® (Botulinum Toxin 
Type A) Study 191622-111, a phase 3 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 
doses (4 U/kg and 8 U/kg) of BOTOX with stan dardized physical therapy in the treatment of 
pediatric lower limb spas ticity involving the ankl e plantar flexors in monoplegic and hemiplegic 
children. 
1.1 Primary Study Objectives and Design 
The primary objective of the study is  to evaluate the safety and ef ficacy of a single treatment of 
2 doses (4U/kg and 8U/kg) of BOTOX with stan dardized physical therapy (PT) in pediatric 
patients with lower limb spasticity. 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-bli nd, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 12-week 
study evaluating 2 doses of BOTOX, 4 and 8 U/kg,  and placebo with standardized PT for the 
treatment of spasticity involving the ankle plantar fle xors in monoplegic and hemiplegic children. 
Patients who successfully complete this study without major protocol deviations (eg, 
noncompliance to protocol-required procedures) will be given the option of enrolling in the 
open-label extension Study 191622-112 if they meet eligibility criteria. 
A centralized randomization scheme stratified by age group, and baselin e modified Ashworth 
Scale – Bohannon (MAS-B) will be used.  Patients w ill be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio ratio to 
one of the following treatment groups: 4 U/kg (not to exceed 150 U) + PT, 8 U/kg (not to exceed 
300 U) + PT, or placebo + PT within each combinati on of strata.  The stratification categories are 
as follows: 
1. Age (≤ 6 years and > 6 years) 
2. Baseline (day 1) MAS-B ankle score with knee extended (MAS-B = 2 and MAS-B  > 
2) 
There will be 1 treatment cycle in the study.  On ly 1 affected lower limb (referred to as the study 
limb) will be treated. The maximum study durati on per patient will be approximately 16 weeks 
(including up to 4 weeks in the screening peri od).  Patients will complete 8 study visits as 
follows:  screening (week -4 to week -2), initiation of standardized PT (week -2), randomization 
and treatment visit (day 1), and pos t-injection follow-up visits at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12.  All 
patients will receive weekly PT sessions from week -2 through week 11. 
Study 191622-111 Analysis Plan 
GDD-BSP-T-001 v2012.5 5 Approximately 412 patients will be enrolled to  ensure that at least 351 patients (117 per 
treatment group) will complete the study. Details on sample size calculation and power 
consideration are presented in S ection 7.5 of the study protocol. 
1.2 Secondary and Other Objectives 
There are no secondary or othe r objectives for this study. 
2 Analysis Populations and Data Conventions 
2.1 Analysis Populations 
Two populations will be used in the statistical an alysis:  safety population and modified intent-to-
treat (mITT) population.  If any patient is mis-st ratified by the site at randomization on day 1, 
this patient’s data will be included in the stratu m to which the patient should have been stratified 
instead of the interactive voice response system (IVRS) stratum for analysis. 
The safety population will include all treated patients based on the treatment received.  All safety 
analyses will be based on the actual treatmen t received by each patient in this population. 
The mITT population will include all randomized patients with a valid MAS-B baseline ankle 
score with knee extended and at least one post-baseline measurement at weeks 2, 4, or 6 for the MAS-B ankle score with knee extended and the C linical Global Impression of Overall Change 
(CGI) by Physician. Here weeks 2, 4, and 6 refe r to the analysis vis its defined in Section 2.2. The 
mITT population will be analyzed according to randomization assignment, regardless of 
treatment actually received. Efficacy data, de mographics, and background information will be 
analyzed on the basis of the mITT population. 
2.2 Treatment Visits 
All days are referenced to day 1.  Day 1 is th e randomization/treatment day.  In the cases where 
randomization and treatment happened on different days, the day of treatment will be used as 
day 1.  Visits according to the windows below will be determined for each variable analyzed 
unless noted otherwise in the following sections.  If there are values from multiple visits in a 
given window, the value collected from the visit closest to the target day will be used to represent 
the window.  If 2 visits with values fall within  the same window and are equidistant from the 
target day, the value from the first of the 2 visi ts chronologically will be used to represent the 
window.  For clinical laboratory variables, the last non-missing observation for that visit window 
will be used.  This rule will be applied separate ly for each variable for non-missing data only.  
Study 191622-111 Analysis Plan 
GDD-BSP-T-001 v2012.5 6 (The exception is because re-runs of laborat ory variables may only involve one or a few 
variables and would thus include missing data for many variables). 
Visit Target Day of the Visit Visit Window (Day*) 
Screening -28 ≤ Day -1 
Day 1 
(Randomization/Treatment) 1 Day 1 
Week 2 15 Day 2 to Day 22 
Week 4 29 Day 23 to Day 36 
Week 6 43 Day 37 to Day 50 
Week 8 57 Day 51 to Day 71 
Week 12 85 ≥ Day 72 
* All days are referenced to day 1.  For post–treatment visits, study day = visit date – day 1 date+1 while for 
pre-treatment visits, study da y = visit date - day 1 date. 
 The visit windows will be used for by-visit analyses in both modified intent-to-treat (mITT) and safety 
population analyses. 
 
2.3 Data Conventions 
The data conventions and definitions listed in this section are to be applie d to all analyses unless 
stated otherwise in a subsequent section of this Analysis Plan. 
• Data will be analyzed according to the 3 treatment groups, ie, (1) BOTOX 8 U/kg, (2) 
BOTOX 4 U/kg, and (3) Placebo. 
• Concomitant medication and prior medicati on will be calculated using the following 
convention:  1) If the stop date of taking medi cation is prior to injec tion date, then it will be 
counted as prior medication;  2) If the start da te of taking medication is after or on injection 
date, then it will be counted as concomitant me dication;  3) If the start date of taking 
medication is prior to injection date and stop date is on or after injection date, then it will be 
counted as both prior medication and concomitant medication. 
• Concurrent procedures are defined as those taken on or after the first injection date. 
• All data will be listed with the exceptions of commonly expected re sults such as physical 
examination, pregnancy tests results fo r females when not applicable, etc. 
• The level of significance used for all statisti cal tests will be 0.05.  All hypotheses will be 
tested for statistical significance with 2-sided alternatives. 
Study 191622-111 Analysis Plan 
GDD-BSP-T-001 v2012.5 7 • Summary statistics of continuous variables will include the sample size (N), mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum (Min), and maximum (Max). 
• Summary statistics of categorical variables wi ll include the sample size (N) and/or frequency 
counts and percentages. 
• Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (M edDRA) nomenclature will be used to code 
all adverse events and medical history. 
• World Health Organization Drug Dictionary Enhanced (WHO DDE) preferred name and 
MedDRA will be used to code all medications. 
• Metric systems will be used for all applicab le measures including (kg), height (cm), and 
clinical laboratory data (SI: Standard International units). 
• Unless otherwise defined, baseline will be the la st non-missing value of an analysis variable 
before treatment.  Therefore, in general values collected prior to the treatment on day 1 will 
be used as baseline except for clinical laboratory tests which will be performed at screening 
instead of day 1.  In the event a variable va lue is missing at the day 1 before treatment time 
point, the last non-missing value before day 1 will be used as baseline.  Change from baseline 
is calculated as follow-up minus baseline value. 
• Missing values will not be imputed. The multiple imputation (MI) method is only intended for sensitivity analyses of MAS-B ankle scor es with knee extended and CGI by Physician.  
• Study days from randomization/da y 1 will be calculated as:  
Study days = visit date – randomization/day 1 visit date + 1. 
• The study day of an event that has occurred before randomization/day 1 will be calculated as: 
Study day = date of event – randomization/day 1 visit date. 
• Partial dates occurring when calculation of study day is germane to the study outcome will be 
handled as follows: 
If the year is missing then the date is treated as missing. 
Study 191622-111 Analysis Plan 
GDD-BSP-T-001 v2012.5 8 If either the month or the day is missing, then  the closest date to baseline possible will be 
used.  That is, an event occurring the year before baseline would use December and/or the 
last day of the month.  An event occurri ng the year after baseline would use January 
and/or the first day of the month. 
All partial dates will be listed “as is” in the data listings. 
• All adverse events with missing onset dates w ill be identified and the missing dates will be 
imputed as follows for analysis.  These imputatio ns are only for assigning adverse events to a 
particular study phase; calculations  such as days to onset will  not use these imputations. All 
partial dates will be listed “as is” in the data listings. 
(a) For adverse event onset date:  If day a nd month are missing but year is available 
(../../yy) then the imputed day and month will be 01/01/yy or the injection date if 
they have the same year, whichever is later.  If the day is mi ssing but the month and 
year are available (mm/../yy), then the imputed day will be mm/01/yy or the 
injection date if they have the same month and year, whichever is later. 
(b) For adverse event stop dates:  If day a nd month are missing but year is available 
(../../yy) then the imputed day and month will be 12/31/yy or the study exit date if 
they have the same year, whichever is ear lier.  If day is missing but the month and 
year are available (mm/../yy), then the imput ed day will be the last day of the month 
mm in the year yy or the study exit date if they have the same month and year, 
whichever is earlier. 
(c) If the adverse event onset or stop month, day, and year are missing (../../..), then the 
study entry date will be used as the adverse event onset date and the exit date will be 
used as the adverse event stop date. 
• Data from unscheduled visits or re-test visits will be treated the same way as scheduled visits, ie, the dates of such visits will be used in the categorization of visit window.  The algorithm 
handling multiple visits within a visit window w ill also be applied to unscheduled visits and 
re-test visits. 
• For the primary and secondary efficacy analyses where study center is a factor in the analysis 
model, centers that recruited only a few patients will be pooled together. The following 
algorithm for pooling study centers will be used: 
A. Pooling of study centers will by country. 
B. Within each country, the following will be conducted: 
Study 191622-111 Analysis Plan 
GDD-BSP-T-001 v2012.5 9 1. Study centers will be ranked in descending order of the total number of patients enrolled. 
2. Any center with at least 12 patients will stand on its own. 
3. The first center with fewer than 12 patients will be combined with the next center until the 
total number in the pooled center reaches or exceeds 12 patients. 
4. The algorithm of combining centers will continue down the list as described above. 5. If the last pooled center still has less than 12 patients, the last pooled center will be combined 
with the previous pooled center. C. If there are less than 12 s ubjects enrolled in a country, the country will be pooled to the 
smallest center in the same region (alphabetical order if there is a tie). The regions include Asia-
Pacific, Europe, and North America. For example, if Canada enrolled less than 12 patients, 
Canada will be pooled with a smallest center in the United States. 
• The mean change from baseline for a given tr eatment group will be calculated by taking the 
sum of all individual changes from baselin e divided by the number of patients with 
observations in that treatment group.  As a c onsequence, patients without the particular 
follow-up data will not be taken into account, except if there is a missing value replacement 
method used. 
  
3 Disposition and Exit Status 
3.1 Screening Log Data 
The number of subjects who are screen failures versus those who are qualified will be tabulated.  
The characteristics (sex, race, and age) of the failed and qualified subjects will be summarized. 
In addition, reasons for failure will be tabulated by “inclusion” and “exclusion”.  The screen failures will be listed by site.   
3.2 Disposition and Exit Status 
A patient disposition and exit status  table will be done for the all randomized subjects population.  
A cumulative frequency table showing patient dis position (enrolled, completed, and discontinued) 
in the study with sub-categorization by reason fo r premature discontinuation for each treatment 
group will be generated.

GDD-BSP-T-001 v2012.5 10 4 Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics 
4.1 Demographics 
The demographics will be summarized for the mITT population. 
Age, race, sex will be summarized using frequency tabulations and/or summary statistics, both 
by treatment group and overall patients.  Race will  be classified as Caucasian and non-Caucasian 
(black, Asian, Hispanic, and other) .  In addition, race will be displayed as collected in the case 
report form (Caucasian, black, Asian, Hispanic, and other). 
4.2 Disease Characteristics 
For the mITT population, the MAS-B ankle score with knee extended and knee flexed at baseline, 
the history of disease including the type (hemip legia and monoplegia), onset, duration, and 
previous botulinum toxin exposure status will be summarized by treatment group  for the mITT 
population.  
4.3 Prior Medications 
Using the mITT population, the number and percent of patients who had taken prior medication (as defined in Section 2.3) will be p resented by treatment gr oup for the base preferred (drug) 
name according to the World Health Organizatio n Drug Dictionary Enhanced (WHO DDE) with 
the same active ingredients by the primary system  organ class (SOC) and preferred term of the 
MedDRA code.  
4.4 Concomitant Medications and Concurrent Procedures 
Concomitant medications (as defined in Section 2.3) will be p resented by WHO DDE preferred 
drug name for each treatment group by the primary SOC and preferred term of the MedDRA 
code using the mITT population. Concurrent pro cedures will be listed for the mITT population. 
4.5 Medical History 
Data for medical history with ons et dates prior to the initial informed consent form signed date 
will be tabulated and presented by the SOC a nd preferred term of MedDRA code for each 
treatment group using the mITT population.

US FDA is described in Section 10. 
Primary efficacy endpoints: 
• The average change from baseline in MAS-B ankle score with knee extended at weeks 4 
and 6 
• The average CGI by Physician at weeks 4 a nd 6 (co-primary efficacy endpoint for US 
FDA only) 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
• The average CGI by Physician at weeks 4 and 6 (for non-US FDA analyses)

• Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS) of the a nkle with knee extended and knee flexed 
 
   
  
 
  
 

Study 191622-111 Analysis Plan 
GDD-BSP-T-001 v2012.5 12   
  
5.1 Collection and Derivation of Efficacy Assessments 
The MAS-B will be used to evaluate spasticity of each of the injected muscle (gastrocnemius, 
soleus, tibialis posterior) base d on rating the resistance encountered in a specific muscle by 
means of passively moving a limb through its range of motion at a specified velocity. 
At day 1 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12, the same  investigator (when po ssible) will assess the 
patient’s ankle muscle tone with knee extended an d knee flexed .  The investigator will extend 
the patient’s ankle from a position of maximum possible plantar flexion to a maximum possible 
dorsiflexion.  The resistance encountered to th e passive stretch will be rated on the MAS-B as 
follows: 
0 =  No increase in muscle tone 
1 =  Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release, or by 
minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected 
part(s) is moved in flexion or extension 
1+ =  Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal 
resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the range of motion 
2 =  More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the range of motion, 
but affected part(s) easily moved.  There can be a catch, but movement 
should be stiff through most of range. 
3 =  Considerable increase in musc le tone, passive movement difficult 
4 =  Affected part(s) rigi d in flexion or extension 
 
The MAS-B scores of 0, 1, 1+, 2, 3, or 4 will be coded as a grade of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, 
respectively.  The MAS-B ankle score change fr om baseline to each post-randomization visit and 
the primary endpoint, average change from baselin e at weeks 4 and 6, will be derived for each 
patient.  Additionally, a responder status will be determined according to whether or not a patient 
has at least a 1-grade reduction fr om baseline in MAS-B ankle score. 
The CGI by Physician will be measured at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12.  There is no CGI assessment at baseline. The CGI is a 9-point scale from -4  (very marked worsening) to +4 (very marked 
improvement).  Each assessment is evaluated rela tive to the patient’s baseline status obtained at 
day 1.  The secondary endpoint fo r CGI will be the aver age of weeks 4 and 6 scores. Additionally, 

Study 191622-111 Analysis Plan 
GDD-BSP-T-001 v2012.5 13 a responder status will be determined according to whether or not a patient has at least +1 score 
of CGI by Physician. 
The secondary efficacy measures of average CG I by Physician at weeks 4 and 6, GAS, and MTS 
will also be collected at scheduled office visi ts according to the Schedule of Visits and 
Procedures in the protocol. 
The GAS is used to measure functional goal attainment relative to the effect of the study 
intervention.  The achievement of 2 functional goals, one active and one passive, preset at week -
2 by the patient and family in consultati on with the investigator and/or treating  physical therapist 
relative to the lower limb impairment due to spas ticity and confirmed at day 1, will be assessed 
at weeks 8 and 12 using a scale of  -3 (worse than start) to +2  (improvements clearly exceed the 
defined therapeutic goal). 
For MTS, the difference between slow and fast range of motion (R2-R1) and respective change 
from baseline to each post-treatment office visit will be derived.  The MTS of the ankle will be 
used to determine the passive range of movement at different movement velocities, V1 (as slow 
as possible) and V3 (as fast as possible) with the relative difference betw een a slow and a fast 
velocity passive stretch determining the dynamic component of the muscle  contracture for the 
joint.  At each visit, the same investigator , when possible will measure two joint angles by 
goniometer:  the R1 angle which is the “angle of ca tch” after a fast velocity (V3) stretch and the 
R2 angle defined as the passive joint range of mo vement following a slow velocity (V1) stretch.  
The R2 – R1 value indicates the level of dyna mic contracture in the joint. The difference 
between slow (R2) and fast (R1) range of mo tion and respective change from baseline to each 
post-treatment office visit on the MTS will be derived.

5.2 Primary Efficacy Analyses 
5.2.1 Primary Analyses of Primary Efficacy Variable 
The primary efficacy analyses will be based on th e mITT population.  The primary analysis will 
be conducted for the average of change from base line in MAS-B of the ankl e plantar flexors with 

Study 191622-111 Analysis Plan 
GDD-BSP-T-001 v2012.5 15 knee extended at weeks 4 and 6. For the assessm ent of treatment groups in the primary endpoint, 
the statistical null hypothesis is that both BO TOX higher dose (8 U/kg) and lower dose (4 U/kg) 
have the same mean as placebo.  The alternat ive hypothesis is that at  least one study dose of 
BOTOX has a different mean than placebo.  Th e hypothesis will be tested using Mixed Model 
Repeated Measures (MMRM) at significance level of 0.05.  The primary variable will be 
summarized by treatment group.  The differences of each BOTOX dose group and the placebo 
group will be used to test the null hypothesis.  The analysis will include weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 data. 
The model will include baseline MAS-B ankle score with knee extended as a covariate and factors of age group, treatment group, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, study center and 
previous botulinum toxin exposure.  Age group is represented by stratification categories 
(≤ 6 years and > 6 years). Baseline MAS-B ankl e score with knee extended is a continuous 
variable included as a covariate. Pooled study cente r will be produced to ensure each contains at 
least 12 patients. Pooling met hod is described in Section 2.3.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A gate-keeping approach will be used to control the type I error rate for the primary endpoint.  Specifically, 8 U/kg versus placebo will be test ed first followed by the 4 U/kg versus placebo 
comparison, each at 2-sided 0.05 level.  The 4 U/kg versus placebo comparison will only be 
performed if the test for 8 U/kg versus  placebo is statistically significant. 
The co-primary analyses for US FDA only is described in Section 10. 
5.2.2 Other Analyses of Primary Efficacy Variable 
For sensitivity analysis purposes to supplement the primary analyses, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model using MI for missing values will be conducted.  A summary of the percentage 

Study 191622-111 Analysis Plan 
GDD-BSP-T-001 v2012.5 16 of missing MAS-B ankle scores with knee exte nded by visit will also be provided. The 
ANCOVA will include baseline MAS-B ankle scor e with knee extended as a covariate and 
factors of age group,  treatment group, study cen ter and previous botulinum toxin exposure.  
The ANCOVA model will be used to analyze eac h imputation dataset obtained from MI as 
described in Section 5.1.  will then be us ed to pool the analyses results 
across the imputation datasets and produce final parameter estimates.  Additional sensitivity 
analyses for the MAS-B ankle score with knee extended changes from baseline at each 
assessment time point will also be performed us ing the same ANCOVA as specified above with 
observed data, and linear contrasts will be used to estimate the treatmen t differences between 
each study dose and placebo.   
In addition, the frequency distribution of th e grade changes from baseline on the MAS-B ankle 
score with knee extended, as well as the percen tage of responders (wit h at least a 1-grade 
reduction in MAS-B), will be summarized by treatm ent group at each post-treatment office visit.  
A logistic regression analysis will also be performed on the responder status at each post-
treatment visit with a covariate of baseline MAS- B ankle score with knee extended and factors of 
age group, treatment group, study center, and previ ous botulinum toxin exposure, if applicable.  
The additional analyses will be conducted using observed cases unless stated otherwise. 
5.3 Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
For secondary efficacy analyses, the observed ca ses will be used unless stated otherwise. 
5.3.1 CGI by Physician 
CGI by Physician will be rated at study weeks 2, 4,  6, 8, and 12.  Descriptive statistics will be 
presented by treatment group at each assessment timepoint  and for the average of weeks 4 and 6.      
CGI by Physician will be summarized and an alyzed by MMRM, as well as ANCOVA at each 
assessment timepoint using observed cases.  MMRM model will include baseline MAS-B ankle 
score with knee extended as a covariate and f actors of age group, treatment group, visit, 
treatment-by-visit interaction,  study center and previous bot ulinum toxin exposure.  The 
frequency distribution of the CGI scores, as well as the percentage of re sponders (CGI score ≥ 1), 
will be summarized by treatment group at each post-treatment visit.  A logistic regression analysis will also be performed on the responder status at each post-treatment visit with factors 
of age group, treatment group, study center, and prev ious botulinum toxin exposure, if applicable. 

Study 191622-111 Analysis Plan 
GDD-BSP-T-001 v2012.5 17 5.3.2 Global Attainment Scale by Physician 
Each of the 2 goals for each patient at each visit will be analyzed by an ANCOVA model with 
age group, treatment group, study center and prev ious botulinum toxin exposure as factors and 
baseline MAS-B ankle score with knee extended as a covariate to assess treatment differences.  
The frequency distribution of raw scores for each goal will be summarized by treatment group.  
Additionally, the percentages of responders who sc ored 0 or higher (meet or exceed expectation) 
and the responders who scored -1 or high (slight  improvement but not meet expectation) on each 
functional goal will also be summarized and re sponder status will be analyzed by logistic 
regression with factors of age group, treatment gr oup, study center and previous botulinum toxin 
exposure, if applicable. 
5.3.3 Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS) of Ankle 
The change from baseline of the angle difference, R2-R1, and the individual R1and R2 respective changes from baseline will be derive d at each post-treatment visit and summarized by 
treatment group, excluding observations where R1 >R2.  An ANCOVA model with age group, 
treatment group, study center and previous botul inum toxin exposure as factors and baseline 
MTS of ankle with knee extended as a covari ate will be performed to assess treatment 
differences.  The raw scores of R2-R1, R2 and R1 will also be summarized and analyzed using similar methods. MTS of ankle with knee flexed will be analyzed using the same method as MTS of ankle with knee extended.

Subgroup analyses by the stratif ication factors of age (≤ 6 years and > 6 years), baseline MAS-B 
score (2 and > 2) and previous exposure to botulinum toxin will be performed for primary 
efficacy variable(s). The “None” subgroup for previous exposure to botulinum toxin is defined as 
the patients who never received botulinum toxin in the past.  
6 Safety Analyses 
Safety variables including the incidence of adverse events, the incidence of suicide-related 
events using the C-SSRS (for patients ≥ 6 years of age at day 1), lab tests values and their 
changes from baseline, as well as vital signs and their change from baseline, immunogenicity 
tests will be summarized by treatment group using the safety population. 
6.1 Exposure to Study Treatments 
Patient exposure to the study medication will be characterized by total dose in U, and dose in 
U/kg body weight.  
Duration of follow up is defined as the number of days  from the first injection to exit; if the date 
of exit is missing, the date of the last visit will be used.  Data will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics for each treatment group. 
In addition, the total dose in U and dose in U/kg body weight will be summarized by individual 
muscle, as well as for all muscles combined. 
6.2 Treatment Emergent Adverse Events  
Adverse events are collected both for the screenin g/baseline period prior to treatment (which are 
referred to as pre-treatment adve rse events as cited in Section 4.6) and for the follow-up period 
after treatment is initiated. 
A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is a post-baseline adverse event with onset after the 
initiation of study treatment or an adverse even t with onset prior to study treatment that 
worsened in severity or became serious after the initiation of study treatment. The number and 
percentage of patients reporting e ach event will be summarized and presented for all events and 
tabulated by treatment groups (8 U/kg, 4 U/kg, and placebo) and overall as follows:

GDD-BSP-T-001 v2012.5 20 i. By primary SOC and preferred term.  At  each level of summarization (overall, 
primary SOC, and preferred term) a patient w ill be counted once if he/she reports 1 or 
more experiences at that level. 
ii. By primary SOC, preferred term and severity .  For a given adverse event of a patient, 
if more than 1 severity grade was reported , the worst severity grade will be included 
in the tabulation.   
All treatment-related TEAEs (study drug-related and injection procedure-related TEAE) will be 
presented by primary SOC and preferred term .  A listing of adverse events leading to 
discontinuation will also be provided. 
The number and percentage of patients with any of the preferred terms will be summarized for 
each primary SOC and preferred term.  All patie nts will be counted only once for each preferred 
term when multiple occurrences of the same preferred term are reported.  
In addition, individual patient data listings (including adverse event listings that include the 
investigator verbatim terms and MedDRA lower level terms) will be provided. 
Furthermore,  the assessment of possible distant spread of toxin will be performed using the list 
of 39 MedDRA preferred terms (version 19.0 or its updated version as appropriate during the 
time of data analysis).

GDD-BSP-T-001 v2012.5 23 6.5 Vital Signs 
Vital signs are assessed at screening, day 1, a nd exit.  Blood pressure (diastolic and systolic 
measured in mmHg), pulse rate (beats/minute), respiratory rate (bre aths/minute), and body 
temperature (°C), weight (kg) will be summari zed by treatment group for each visit and change 
from baseline to exit visit will also be summarized by treatment group.  
6.6 Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
Suicidality for age over 6 years will be assess ed using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating 
Scale (C-SSRS), conducted at every assessment vis it.  Suicide-related ev ents corresponding to 
the C-SSRS questions will be classified into the following 11 categories: 
• Self-injurious behavior, no suicidal intent 
• Suicidal ideation 
1. Wish to be dead 
2. Active: Nonspecific (no method, intent, or plan)  
3. Active: Method, but no intent or plan 
4. Active: Method and intent but no plan 
5. Active: Method, intent and plan 
• Suicidal behavior 1. Preparatory acts or behaviors  
2. Aborted attempt 
3. Interrupted attempt 
4. Suicide attempt  
5. Completed suicide 
The number and percentage of patients with the above suicide-related events during treatment 
will be presented by treatment group.   If a patient has more than one suicide-related event during 
an interval, the most severe event in in creasing order listed above will be used. 
Study 191622-111 Analysis Plan 
GDD-BSP-T-001 v2012.5 24 6.7 Immunogenicity Testing  
Blood samples (approximately 7 mL per visit) will be  collected for immunogenicity testing at the 
screening visit and study exit from patients who we igh at least 15 kg at the screening visit.  A 2-
stage assay approach will be used for the detection of binding antibodies against BoNT-A and 
neutralizing antibodies against BO TOX in patients’ serum.  In stage 1, serum samples will be 
screened for reactivity using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  The 
reactive serum samples will be subsequently titered to assess the extent of antibodies present and 
immunodepleted to confirm that the reactivities ar e specific to BoNT-A.  In stage 2, only samples 
that are confirmed positive in the ELISA will be  tested for neutralizing antibodies to BOTOX 
using a validated assay.   
Immunogenicity results of binding antibodies (B ABs) against BoNT-A will be reported as 
positive or negative.  Immunogenicity results of  neutralizing antibodies (NABs) against BOTOX 
will be reported as positive, negative, or inconclusive.  For NABs, the total negatives including 
patients with negative neutralizing antibody results as well as with negative binding antibody 
results will be reported.   
 Immunogenicity findings will be tabulated with th e number and percent of patients at each visit 
separately for each treatment group.  Percentages will be based on the number of treated patients 
with interpretable antibody assays in each treatment  group at the specified visit.  Antibody titers 
will be summarized by median, minimum, and maximum.   
 
Depending on the timing and availability of data, immunogenicity data may be locked separately, 
at a different time point following the database lock for the main clinical data.  
6.8 Other Safety Analyses 
6.8.1 Physical Examination 
Physical examination will be performed at scr eening and study exit.  Abnormal findings will be 
listed.   
6.8.2 Pregnancy Test 
The urine pregnancy test will be performed for females of childbearing potential at screening, day 1 prior to injection and at study exit.  Positiv e pregnancy test results (any pregnancies will be 
reported in the clinical st udy report) will be listed.

8 Pharmacokinetic Data Analyses 
There will be no pharmacokinetic data to be analyzed from this study. 
9 Health Outcomes Data Analyses 
There will be no health outcomes data to be analyzed from this study. 
10 Analysis for US FDA HFD-550 
Analyses are as described in all preceding se ctions except for the items described below. 
10.1 Primary Efficacy Analyses 
There are 2 co-primary endpoints:  the average grade change from baseline in the MAS-B ankle 
score with knee extended at weeks 4 and 6 and th e average CGI by Physician at weeks 4 and 6.  
For both co-primary endpoints, the statistical null hypothesis is that both the higher dose (8 U/kg) 
and the lower dose (4 U/kg) have the same mean as  placebo.  The alternative hypothesis is that at 
least one study dose has a different mean than pl acebo.  In addition to the primary statistical 
analyses cited in Section 5.2.1 for the average g rade change from baseline in MAS-B ankle score 
with knee extended at weeks 4 and 6, the aver age CGI by Physician at weeks 4 and 6 will be 
analyzed using the same statistical method with a same MMRM model in Section 5.3.1. 
The Hochberg procedure (Hochberg and Tamhane, 1987) will be used to control the family-wise 
type I error rate.  With 2 doses and 2 co-pri mary endpoints in each dose, the maximum p-value 
for the 2 co-primary endpoints in each dose will be used in the Hochberg procedure.  We first 
define the following values: 
p11:  p value for Botox 8 U/kg vs placebo comparing MAS-B  
p12:  p value for Botox 4 U/kg vs placebo comparing MAS-B  p21:  p value for Botox 8 U/kg vs placebo comparing CGI  p22:  p value for Botox 4 U/kg vs placebo comparing CGI  
p1 = max(p11, p21), p2 = max(p12, p22).  
Study 191622-111 Analysis Plan 
GDD-BSP-T-001 v2012.5 26 p1 and p2 will be sorted in an increasing order to get p(1) ≤ p(2).  The following decision rule 
will then be applied: 
Step 1:  If p(2) ≤  0.05, both doses are considered efficacious; otherwise go to step 2. 
Step 2:  If p(1) ≤  0.025, its corresponding dose is consider ed efficacious; otherwise go to step 3. 
Step 3:  Neither dose is considered efficacious. 
For sensitivity analysis purposes to supplemen t the co-primary analyses, ANCOVA using MI for 
missing values will be conducted for the co-primary endpoints of MAS-B ankle score with knee 
extended and CGI.  The model will include baseline MAS-B ankle score with knee extended as a covariate and factors of age group, treatment gr oup, study center, and previous botulinum toxin 
exposure.  A summary of the percentages of mi ssing MAS-B and CGI scores by visit will also be 
provided.  Additional sensitivity analyses for the MAS-B ankle score with knee extended changes from baseline and CGI scores at each assessment timepoint will also be performed using the same ANCOVA with observed data, and line ar contrasts will be used to estimate the 
treatment differences between each study dose and placebo.   
10.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
The secondary efficacy analyses will be the same as the statistical an alyses cited in Section 5.3 
except for the analyses for CGI by Physician which is described in the Section 10.1. 
11 Data Collected but not Analyzed 
The date and signature of investigator and system required variables of electronic data capture 
(EDC) and IVRS/IWRS will not be analyzed. 
12 Deviations from Protocol 
There are no deviations from protocol amendment 3.

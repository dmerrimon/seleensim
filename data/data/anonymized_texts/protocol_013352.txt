GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.01. Protocol Summary
1.1. Synopsis
Protocol Title: A Phase 2, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Sequential, 
Ascending, Multidose Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Linaclotide in Pediatric 
Participants (Age 2 to 5 Years) with Functional Constipation
Protocol Number: LIN-MD-67
Amendment Number: 1
Brief Title: Linaclotide Safety and Efficacy in 2 to 5-Year Old Participants with Functional 
Constipation Study Phase: 2
Study Rationale:
Functional constipation (FC) is a common healthcare problem in children of all ages, with a 
worldwide prevalence ranging between 0.7% and 29.6% ( Koppen 2018 ). Symptoms include 
infrequent, hard stools, and painful defecation and affected children may have abdominal pain 
and fecal incontinence, which is usually the result of fecal impaction leading to overflow 
incontinence. These symptoms can have a severe impact on a child’s quality of life and may lead 
to school absenteeism and substantial costs related to healthcare utilization. Initial nonpharmacological interventions include education, behavioral modifications, and keeping a 
bowel diary. Despite these interventions, many children require pharmacological interventions. 
Treatment consists of dis-impaction (ie, removal of the rectal fecal mass), followed by maintenance treatment and eventually a weaning phase. Multiple pharmacological agents are 
available for the treatment of FC in children. Despite chronic pharmacological treatment, 
approximately 40% of children with FC referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist remain symptomatic after 5 years and 20% of children still have symptoms after 10 years. In some cases, 
symptoms may persist into adolescence or adulthood despite medical treatment. Potential reasons 
for ineffectiveness of treatment include suboptimal dosage regimens, poor compliance with treatment, or the use of drugs with action mechanisms that do not address the underlying pathophysiological etiology.
Despite the fact that children with FC are commonly prescribed various and miscellaneous 
pharmacologic agents for FC, it is notable that there are no approved products indicated for FC 
in children or well controlled trials of these frequently prescribed agents. Thus, effective 
treatments are needed to provide symptomatic relief in children and adolescents with FC, with the evidence for safety and efficacy of these based on the results of adequate and well-controlled studies in children.
For the primary and key secondary endpoints in the Phase 2 dose-ranging LIN-MD-62 study in 
children, 6 to 17 years of age, with FC, none of the 3 linaclotide doses (A [low dose], B [medium

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.0dose], and C [high dose]) indicated clear improvement over placebo (p-value ≥ 0.1502) based on 
analysis of the ITT population. However, a numerical trend towards efficacy at the higher doses 
was observed for the primary endpoint of change from baseline in 4-week overall spontaneous 
bowel movement (SBM) frequency rate (SBMs/week). Overall, linaclotide was well tolerated 
across all doses in participants, 6 to 17 years of age. The safety profile was consistent with prior adult linaclotide chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) studies.
As linaclotide was well tolerated across all doses tested in 6 to 17-year old participants treated in 
LIN-MD-62, LIN-MD-67 is being initiated in younger children with the primary objective of evaluating the dose response, safety, and efficacy of 4 weeks of linaclotide in pediatric participants, 2 to 5 years of age, with FC.
Objectives and Endpoints:
The objective of LIN-MD-67 is to evaluate the dose response, safety, and efficacy of 4 weeks of 
study intervention with linaclotide compared with placebo in pediatric participants, 2 to 5 years of age, with FC.
Key efficacy endpoints include:
!Change from baseline in 4-week overall SBM frequency rate (SBMs/week) during the 
Study Intervention Period of each cohort
!Change from baseline in 4-week stool consistency reported by the caregiver during the Study Intervention Period of each cohort
!Change from baseline in 4-week straining reported by the caregiver during the Study Intervention Period of each cohort
!Proportion of days with fecal incontinence during the Study Intervention Period (for participants who have acquired toileting skills during the daytime and nighttime or acquired toileting skills during daytime only) within each cohort
The safety assessments will include monitoring of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory 
assessments (clinical chemistry, complete blood count [CBC], urinalysis), vital sign 
measurements (including postural vital signs), electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, height, and weight.
Overall Study Design:
Study LIN-MD-67 is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential, 
ascending multidose study with a 4-week study intervention period in participants, 2 to 5 years of age, with FC. 
Number of Participants:
Up to 30 participants, 2 to 5 years of age, will be sequentially enrolled into LIN-MD-67; 8
participants each into Cohorts 1 to 3 and 6 participants in the final cohort. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive linaclotide or matching placebo as described below.

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.0Number of Sites:
Up to 40 sites from the United States and Canada are expected to participate in the study.
Study Intervention Groups and Study Duration:
The study will consist of up to 4 cohorts, each of which will be studied for 9 to 12 weeks in 
duration: 2 to 4-week Screening Period, a 2 to 3-week Preintervention Period, followed by a 
4-week double-blind Study Intervention Period, and a 1-week Postintervention Period (Section 1.2).
Participants will not receive study intervention during the Screening/Preintervention Period and the Postintervention Period. 
After at least 6 participants in Cohorts 1 to 3 complete at least 2 weeks of double-blind study 
intervention, an independent DSMB will review unblinded interim safety data. Based on this 
review, the DSMB will recommend whether the subsequent planned dose level should be tested. New participants will be recruited for each cohort.
Please refer to Figure 1-1 for assignment of participants to dose cohorts.
!Cohorts 1-3: 8 participants will be randomized at a ratio of 3:1 to receive linaclotide or 
matching placebo:
o Cohort 1: linaclotide 18 μg or matching placebo once daily for 4-week Study 
Intervention Period.  
o Cohort 2: linaclotide 36 μg or matching placebo once daily for 4-week Study 
Intervention Period. The DSMB will have the option to recommend the lower 
dose of linaclotide  μg instead of the 36 μg dose, based on review of unblinded 
interim safety data from Cohort 1.
o Cohort 3: linaclotide 72 μg or matching placebo once daily for 4-week Study 
Intervention Period. Participants will only be assigned to this cohort if the DSMB recommends proceeding to this 72 μg dose based on unblinded interim safety data 
from Cohort 2 with the linaclotide 36 μg dose. 
!Final Cohort: 6 participants will be randomized at a ratio of 5:1 to receive linaclotide at the highest dose tested/determined to be safe or matching placebo for 4-week Study

during an optional repeat physical examination, the study physician must be notified.
iFecal impaction is defined as a hard mass in the lower abdomen identified on physical examination or a dilated rectum filled 
with a large amount of stool on rectal examination. If a rectal examination is performed, the medically qualified site personnel should assess for and document the presence of anal wink and normal anal tone. A fecal impaction assessment is 
only performed at the Preintervention Visit (Visit 2) if a fecal impaction was documented during the fecal impaction 
assessment at Screening (Visit 1). If there is no fecal impaction at the Preintervention Visit (Visit 2), the participant mayenter the Preintervention Period after adhering to any washout requirements. If fecal impaction is present upon re-examination, the participant will not be eligible for the study.
jA fecal impaction assessment is performed at the Randomization Visit (Visit 3) prior to randomization and dosing for all participants. If there is no fecal impaction at the Randomization Visit (Visit 3) (as defined in footnote i above), the participant may enter the Randomization Period. If fecal impaction is present upon examination, the participant will not be eligible for randomization.
kVital signs include weight, temperature (oral, rectal, or tympanic), and respiratory rate. Postural vital signs (supine and standing) include pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest for the participant in a quiet setting. At all visits, postural vital signs must be obtain ed 
after participants have been in a supine position for at least 2 to 3 minutes, followed by a standing position for at least

linaclotide

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.02. Introduction
Linaclotide is a 14-amino acid peptide that acts on the apical surface of epithelial cells 
surrounding the intestinal lumen to stimulate the r eceptor guanylate cyclase subtype C (GC-C). 
Linaclotide is approved for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) 
and CIC in the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and Mexico; for the treatment of IBS-C 
in China, the EU, Hong Kong, Macau, and Switzerland; and is being studied in other regions. By activating GC- C, orally administered linaclotide has been found to increase both intestinal fluid 
secretion and intestinal transit and to also decrease visceral (abdominal) pain. Linaclotide has 
minimal oral bioavailability ( ≤ 0.2%) in several animal species ( Bryant 2010; Eutamene 2010 ) 
and is minimally absorbed with low systemic availability in adults. Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for a more detailed description of the ch emistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of 
linaclotide, based on studies conducted in animals, healthy volunteers, and in participants with 
IBS-C and CIC (linaclotide IB).
Two Phase 2 dose-ranging studies have been conducted with linaclotide in pediatric participants; 
one in FC, 6 to 17 years of age (LIN-MD-62), and one in IBS-C, 7 to 17 years of age (LIN-MD-63). Results from these two studies are summarized in Section 2.2.2. 
2.1. Study Rationale
Functional constipation is a common healthcare problem in children of all ages, with a 
worldwide prevalence ranging between 0.7% and 29.6% ( Koppen 2018 ). Symptoms include 
infrequent, hard stools, and painful defecation and affected children may have abdominal pain 
and fecal incontinence, which is usually the result of fecal impaction leading to overflow 
incontinence. These symptoms can have a severe impact on a child’s quality of life and may lead 
to school absenteeism and substantial costs related to healthcare utilization. Initial nonpharmacological interventions include education, behavioral modifications, and keeping a 
bowel diary. Despite these interventions, many children require pharmacological interventions. 
Treatment consists of disimpaction (ie, removal of the rectal fecal mass), followed by maintenance treatment and eventually a weaning phase. Multiple pharmacological agents are 
available for the treatment of FC in children. Despite chronic pharmacological treatment, 
approximately 40% of children with FC referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist remain symptomatic after 5 years and 20% of children still have symptoms after 10 years. In some cases, 
symptoms may persist into adolescence or adulthood despite medical treatment. Potential reasons 
for ineffectiveness of treatment include suboptimal dosage regimens, poor compliance with treatment, or the use of drugs with action mechanisms that do not address the underlying pathophysiological etiology.
There are no approved products for FC in children. Thus, effective treatments are needed to 
provide symptomatic relief in children and adolescents with FC, with the evidence for the safety and efficacy of these based on the results of adequate and well-controlled studies in children. 
For the primary and key secondary endpoints in the Phase 2 dose-ranging LIN-MD-62 study in 
children, 6 to 17 years of age, none of the 3 linaclotide doses (A [low dose], B [medium dose], 
and C [high dose]) indicated clear improvement over placebo (p-value ≥ 0.1502) based on the 
ITT population. However, a numerical trend towards efficacy at the higher doses was observed

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.0for the primary endpoint of change from baseline in 4-week overall SBM frequency rate 
(SBMs/week). In addition, the safety profile was consistent with prior adult linaclotide studies in CIC.
As linaclotide was well tolerated across all doses tested in 6 to 17-year old participants treated in 
LIN-MD-62, LIN-MD-67 is being initiated in younger children with the primary objective of 
evaluating the dose response, safety, and efficacy of 4 weeks of linaclotide in pediatric participants, 2 to 5 years of age, with FC.
2.2. Background
2.2.1. Adult Linaclotide Program
Linaclotide has been developed by the sponsors, Allergan Sales, LLC and Ironwood 
Pharmaceuticals Inc., and is approved at 72 μg and 145 μg for the treatment of CIC and 290 ug 
for the treatment of IBS-C in adults. The adult linaclotide clinical development program that 
culminated in FDA and EMA approvals included the following studies conducted in North 
America.
!4 large double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 registration studies (2 IBS-C studies 
[LIN-MD-31 and MCP-103-302] and 2 CIC studies [LIN-MD-01 and MCP-103-303])
!2 long-term adult safety studies (LIN-MD-02 and MCP-103-305), each with 78-week study intervention periods
!3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies (1 IBS-C study[Phase 3b study MCP-103-312] and 2 CIC studies [Phase 3b study LIN-MD-04 and Phase 3 study MCP-103-309]) have been completed.
Safety data from these adult studies showed that, except for diarrhea, the proportion of 
participants reporting a TEAE was similar between placebo and each linaclotide dose group, in the IBS-C and CIC studies, and the incidence of TEAEs was not dose-related. 
With the exception of the gastrointestinal (GI) System Organ Class (SOC), (due to, as previously 
stated, the disproportionately high reporting of diarrhea in patients taking linaclotide), the occurrence of TEAEs in the CIC and IBS-C participants was balanced across study intervention 
groups in each SOC for the adult Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies. Diarrhea was the most 
frequently reported TEAE in linaclotide-treated CIC and IBS-C participants, consistent with its pharmacology; however, diarrhea was rarely associated with serious sequelae such as dehydration, fecal incontinence, or defecation urgency. 
SAEs were infrequent and balanced across study intervention groups within each indication, and 
there were no SAEs of diarrhea reported. An analysis of the SAEs across the entire clinical 
development program revealed no pattern to suggest that linaclotide causes any specific serious 
condition.

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.0Minor abnormalities in laboratory, vital sign, or ECG parameters were observed rarely; overall, 
there were no clinically meaningful differences between linaclotide and placebo study intervention groups for any of these parameters in the Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies in adults.
Additional registration studies were conducted outside of North America, which supported the 
approval of linaclotide for the treatment of IBS-C and CC in Japan and IBS-C in China. Results 
from these studies were consistent with those studies conducted in North America (linaclotide 
IB). 
2.2.2. Pediatric Linaclotide Program
A total of 214 pediatric participants were treated with linaclotide in two Phase 2 dose-ranging 
studies in the FC and IBS-C pediatric populations (LIN-MD-62 and LIN-MD-63, respectively).
LIN-MD-62 was a Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, safety and efficacy 
study of a range of linaclotide doses administered to participants, 6 to 17 years of age, who 
fulfilled modified Rome III criteria for FC (refer to Table 2–1 for dosing information). The 
objective of LIN-MD-62 was to evaluate the dose response, safety, and efficacy of 4 weeks of 
study intervention with 1 of 3 linaclotide doses (Dose A, B, and C) or 145 μg (as an exploratory 
objective in the adolescent participants, 12 to17 years of age, using the approved adult dose) compared with placebo in pediatric participants who fulfill modified Rome III criteria for child/adolescent FC with the goal of selecting an optimal dose of linaclotide to evaluate in a confirmatory study. 
A total of 173 participants were randomized to receive 1 of 3 proposed linaclotide doses (Dose 
A, B, and C) for pediatrics (n = 116 participants), the approved adult linaclotide dose (145 μg, 
n = 16 participants), or placebo (n = 41 participants) for 4 weeks of study intervention followed by a 1-week Postintervention Period ( Table 2–1). For the primary and key secondary endpoints 
in the Phase 2 dose-ranging LIN-MD-62 study, none of the 3 linaclotide doses (A [low dose], B 
[medium dose], and C [high dose]) indicated clear improvement over placebo (p-value ≥0.1502) 
based on analysis of the ITT population. However, a numerical trend toward efficacy at the 
higher doses was observed for the primary endpoint of change from baseline in 4-week overall 
SBM frequency rate (SBMs/week). Overall, linaclotide was well tolerated across all doses and 
both age groups. The safety profile was consistent with prior adult lin aclotide studies for CIC. The
most frequently reported TEAE was diarrhea, which occurred in 7.6% of linaclotide-treated 
participants versus 0% in the placebo group. The majority of the TEAEs of diarrhea reported 
were mild; none were severe. In the 12 to 17 years of age group, one participant experienced moderate diarrhea (related) leading to discontinuation in the linaclotide Dose C group.
There were no reported AESIs (ie, significant volume depletion and/or significant electrolyte 
abnormalities and/or ECG abnormalities that were considered by the investigator or sponsor to be related to diarrhea) or deaths. There were 2 SAEs (suicidal ideation and vomiting), each
reported in 1 participant, in the 12 to 17 years of age group, neither were considered related to 
study intervention. Moreover, in the younger pediatric participants, 6 to 11 years of age, no SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation were reported.

LIN-MD-63 was a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, safety and efficacy dose-ranging study of linaclotide in children ages 7 to 17 
years with IBS-C. The objectives of LIN-MD-63 were to evaluate the dose response, safety, and 
efficacy of 4 weeks of treatment with 1 of 3 linaclotide doses (Dose A, B, or C; refer to 
Table 2-2 for dosing information) or 290 ∀g (as an exploratory objective in the adolescent 
participants, 12 to 17 years of age, using the approved adult dose) compared with placebo in 
pediatric participants 7 to 17 years of age who fulfill the Rome III criteria for child/adolescent IBS and modified Rome III criteria for child/adolescent FC.
According to the original study design, approximately 260 participants with IBS-C were planned 
to be randomized in this study. However, due to slow participant enrollment, this study was terminated early based on FDA’s feedback (Type C Meeting for pediatric IBS-C, June 2019). 
The actual sample size achieved was 101 randomized participants, which is approximately 39% 
of the original planned sample size. These 101 IBS-C participants were randomized to receive 1 of 3 proposed linaclotide doses (Dose A, B, and C) for pediatrics (n = 74 participants), the 
approved adult linaclotide dose (290 μg, n = 8 participants), or placebo (n = 19 participants) for 
4 weeks of study intervention. For the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in 
4-week overall SBM frequency rate, numerical improvement was observed with each increasing 
linaclotide dose compared with placebo based on analysis of the ITT population. For the key 
secondary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in 4-week abdominal pain daytime symptoms, numerical improvement was observed with linaclotide 290 μg compared with 
placebo, while results were similar in the other linaclotide groups (Dose A, B, and C) compared with placebo.

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.0Overall, linaclotide was safe and well tolerated across all doses and both age groups. The safety 
profile was consistent with prior adult linaclotide studies for IBS-C. The most commonly reported TEAE was diarrhea. The majority of the TEAEs of diarrhea reported were mild; none 
were severe. In participants 12 to 17 years of age, AEs leading to discontinuation were reported 
in 1 participant in the linaclotide Dose B group (diarrhea [related]) and 1 participant in the placebo group (abdominal pain, anaphylactic reaction [SAE], and hematemesis; all considered 
not related to study treatment). There were no AESIs (ie, significant volume depletion and/or 
significant electrolyte abnormalities and/or ECG abnormalities that are considered by the investigator or sponsor to be related to diarrhea) or deaths reported. There were 2 SAEs reported 
in participants 12-17 years of age (1 each in the placebo and linaclotide Dose A [36 μg] groups), 
neither of which were diarrhea, and neither were considered related to study intervention. 
Moreover, in pediatric participants 7 to 11 years of age, no SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation were reported.
As with adults, linaclotide is minimally absorbed with low systemic availability in this pediatric 
population.

2.2.3. Other Nonclinical Information
2.2.3.1. Nonclinical Toxicology
In nonclinical studies, oral administration of linaclotide at 10 μg/kg/day caused deaths in young 
neonatal mice (human age equivalent of approximately 0 – 28 days old). These deaths were due 
to rapid and severe dehydration produced by significant fluid shifts into the intestinal lumen 
resulting from GC-C agonism in neonatal mice. Supplemental subcutaneous fluid administration prevented death after linaclotide administration in neonatal mice. Tolerability to linaclotide 
increases with age in juvenile mice. In 2-week-old mice, linaclotide was well tolerated at a dose 
of 50 μg/kg/day, but deaths occurred after a single oral dose of 100 μg/kg. In 3-week-old mice, 
linaclotide was well tolerated at 100 μg/kg/day, but deaths occurred after a single oral dose of

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.0600μg/kg. Significantly higher doses ( ≥ 200 times the clinically relevant adult dose) were 
tolerated in 4-week-old juvenile mice, human age equivalent of approximately > 2 years old to 
7 years old without supplemental fluid administration. Based on these nonclinical results, the 
Linzess PI (Jan 2017) has a contraindication in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age and a 
boxed warning regarding its use in pediatric patients.
2.2.3.2. GC-C mRNA Expression 
Prior research suggested GC-C receptors may be present in younger children at a greater density 
than in adults ( Guarino, 1987; Cohen, 1988 ). Greater GC-C receptor density in childhood could 
result in amplification of the pharmacological effects of GC-C activation, with important clinical 
implications for treating children with a GC-C agonist. Study MCP-103-311 was conducted to 
measure GC-C mRNA levels in duodenal and colonic mucosal tissue samples obtained from 
children, 0 to <18 years of age, who underwent endoscopy or colonoscopy. Four different age groups were evaluated ie, from birth to <24 months, 24 months to <6 years, 6 years to <12 years, and 12 years to <18 years.  
The results showed that there was no trend toward an increase or decrease in GC-C mRNA 
expression based on age in either duodenal or colonic tissues. Along with results in LIN-MD-62 
(Section 2.2.2), these results from study MCP-103-311 support a flat dosing approach for 
pediatric participants in the Phase 3 pediatric studies and not a body weight-based approach.
2.2.4. Post-marketing Experience
In post-marketing experience, severe diarrhea AEs associated with dizziness, syncope, 
hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia and hyponatremia) requiring 
hospitalization or IV fluid administration have been reported in adult participants treated with linaclotide.
2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment
Although not life threatening, FC is a common healthcare problem in children of all ages, with a worldwide prevalence ranging between 0.7% and 29.6% ( Koppen 2018 ). Symptoms include 
infrequent, hard stools, and painful defecation and affected children may have abdominal pain 
and fecal incontinence, which is usually the result of fecal impaction leading to overflow 
incontinence. These symptoms can have a severe impact on a child’s quality of life and may lead to school absenteeism and substantial costs related to healthcare utilization.   
Linaclotide has a safety profile that has been well established in adults with IBS-C and CIC
(linaclotide IB). Moreover, the safety profile in the first completed pediatric linaclotide study in FC, LIN-MD-62, was consistent with prior adult linaclotide studies in CIC. There were no new 
safety signals observed in the pediatric participants and linaclotide was well tolerated across all 
doses and age groups. Refer to the IB for a more detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of linaclotide, based on studies conducted in animals, healthy volunteers, and in participants with IBS-C and CIC.
There are no pharmacologic therapies approved in the pediatric population specifically for the 
treatment of FC. Thus, there is a need for new agents with favorable safety and tolerability

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.0profiles that are effective in providing relief for the variety of symptoms associated with FC in 
pediatrics. 
Linaclotide provides an important treatment option for adult patients with FC. Linaclotide may 
offer a therapeutic option to treat the symptoms in the pediatric population with FC. The 
sponsors consider the benefit-risk balance is favorable and supports further clinical development of linaclotide as a treatment for FC in the pediatric population.
See Section 4, Study Design for details of study procedures, dose, and study design justification.
3. Objectives and Endpoints
The objective of LIN-MD-67 is to evaluate the dose response, safety, and efficacy of 4 weeks of 
study intervention with linaclotide compared with placebo in pediatric participants, 2 to 5 years of age, with FC.
Key efficacy endpoints include:
!Change from baseline in 4-week overall SBM frequency rate (SBMs/week) during the 
Study Intervention Period of each cohort
!Change from baseline in 4-week stool consistency reported by the caregiver during the Study Intervention Period of each cohort
!Change from baseline in 4-week straining reported by the caregiver during the Study Intervention Period of each cohort
!Proportion of days with fecal incontinence during the Study Intervention Period (for participants who have acquired toileting skills during the daytime and nighttime or acquired toileting skills during daytime only) within each cohort
The safety assessments will include monitoring of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory 
assessments (clinical chemistry, complete blood count [CBC], urinalysis), vital sign 
measurements (including postural vital signs), electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, height, and weight.
4. Study Design
4.1. Overall Design
Study LIN-MD-67 is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential, 
ascending multidose study with a 4-week Study Intervention Period in participants, 2 to 5 years 
of age, who meet modified Rome III criteria for childhood FC. 
Up to 30 participants, 2 to 5 years of age, will be sequentially enrolled into LIN-MD-67; eight 
participants each into Cohorts 1 to 3 and six participants in the final cohort. Participants will be 
randomly assigned to receive linaclotide or matching placebo as described below.

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.0Number of Sites: 
Up to 40 sites from the United States and Canada are expected to participate in the study.
Study Intervention Groups and Study Duration:
The study will consist of up to 4 cohorts, each of which will be 9 to 12 weeks in duration: 2 to 
4-week Screening Period, a 2 to 3-week Preintervention Period, followed by a 4-week 
double-blind Study Intervention Period, and a 1-week Postintervention Period (Section 1.2).
Participants will not receive study intervention during the Screening/Preintervention Period and the Postintervention Period. 
After at least 6 participants in Cohorts 1 to 3 complete at least 2 weeks of double-blind study 
intervention, an independent DSMB will review unblinded interim safety data. Based on this 
review, the DSMB will recommend whether the subsequent planned dose level should be tested. 
New participants will be recruited for each cohort.
Please refer to Figure 4-1 for assignment of participants to dose cohorts.
!Cohorts 1-3: 8 participants will be randomized at a ratio of 3:1 to receive linaclotide or 
matching placebo:  
o Cohort 1: linaclotide 18 μg or matching placebo once daily for 4-week Study 
Intervention Period.  
o Cohort 2: linaclotide 36 μg or matching placebo once daily for 4-week Study 
Intervention Period. The DSMB will have the option to recommend the lower 
dose of linaclotide  μg instead of the 36 μg dose, based on review of unblinded 
interim safety data from Cohort 1.
o Cohort 3: linaclotide 72 μg or matching placebo once daily for 4-week Study 
Intervention Period. Participants will only be assigned to this cohort if the DSMB recommends proceeding to this 72 μg dose based on unblinded interim safety data 
from Cohort 2 with the linaclotide 36 μg dose. 
!Final Cohort: 6 participants will be randomized at a ratio of 5:1 to receive linaclotide at 
the highest dose tested/determined to be safe or matching placebo for 4-week Study 
Intervention Period (ie,  18, 36, 72 μg depending on the recommendation of the 
DSMB).

For participants in the 6 to 11 years age group in LIN-MD-62, the highest dose tested was 2μg/kg. The linaclotide dose selected for Cohort 1 in the current LIN-MD-67 study, 18 μg, is 
consistent with the highest μg /kg dose tested in LIN-MD-62 in the 6 to 11 years age group (not 
to exceed 1.8 μg /kg) given minimum weight requirement for eligibility is 10kg. Dose escalation 
between cohorts will be implemented based on the review of all available safety/tolerability data by an independent DSMB.

Assuming that the DSMB recommends proceeding to the next subsequent higher dose cohort, the 
following doses are planned to be tested in an ascending cohort design in the current study:
!Cohort 1: 18 μ g (not to exceed 1.8 μg /kg, assuming minimum body weight of 10 kg*)
!Cohort 2: 36 μ g (not to exceed 3.6 μ g /kg, assuming minimum body weight of 10 kg*)

1. Medical Conditions
1.01 Participant has clinically significant findings on a physical examination, vital sign 
assessment, ECG, or clinical laboratory tests at Screening (Visit 1), as determined by the investigator, based on consideration of whether the finding could represent a safety 
concern or a condition that would be exclusionary, could prevent the participant from 
performing any protocol assessments, or could confound study assessments.
1.02 Caregiver reports the participant had more than 1 loose, mushy stool (eDiary-recorded stool consistency of 6 on the Bristol Stool Form Scale [BSFS]) or any watery stool

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.04.02 Participant’s parent/guardian/LAR or caregiver has been directly or indirectly involved in 
the conduct and administration of this study as an investigator, study coordinator, or other study staff member. In addition, any participant, parent/guardian/LAR or caregiver who has a first-degree family member, significant other, or relative residing with him/her directly or indirectly who is involved in this study
4.03 For participants aged ≥ 4 years old: Participant has a history of non-retentive fecal incontinence
Rationale for Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are meant to identify a population of pediatric participants 
that is well characterized as having FC who fulfill modified Rome III criteria for childhood FC.
5.3. Lifestyle Considerations
Caregivers will be advised to have participants adopt the following nonpharmacologic habits and instructed to maintain them throughout the study. There should be at least a 2-week interval 
between discussing the lifestyle modifications during the Screening Period and the participant’s 
entry into the Preintervention Period.
!Adequate fluids : The investigator will discuss the fluid intake necessary to maintain a 
hydrated state (intake requirements may vary amongst children - eg, child athletes, children in hot climates).
!A high-fiber diet : Adequate intake values for fiber range from 19 to 25 g/day for 
children 1 to 8 years of age. High-fiber foods include beans, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Start slowly, adding just several grams of fiber a day over the Screening Period to reduce the amount of gas and bloating that can occur in someone who is not used to consuming high-fiber foods. 
!Increased physical activity : Participants should be physically active throughout the day. 
Caregivers of participants should encourage active play that includes a variety of activity types. 
!Adequate time for bowel movements : 
oFor participants who have acquired toileting skills prior to Screening (Visit 1) encourage the child to sit on the toilet for 5 to 10 minutes twice daily within 30 minutes after a meal (breakfast and dinner). Follow the routine every day, even during holidays and vacations. 
oFor participants who have started toilet training prior to Screening (Visit 1) but are not yet toilet trained, encourage the child to continue with same toilet training 
regimen (defined as sitting on the toilet for 5 to 10 minutes twice daily within 
30 minutes after a meal (breakfast and dinner) during the study. Participants should not change the toileting behavior during the study as changes in toileting skills may

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.0impact bowel habits and accurate reporting of bowel movements and fecal 
incontinence. 
oParents/caregivers will be requested not to start the toilet training process with their 
child during the child’s participation in the study. Changes in toileting skills may 
impact bowel habits and accurate reporting of bowel movements and fecal incontinence
5.4. Screen Failures
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not subsequently entered in the study. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory 
authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any SAE.
Participants who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failures) may be 
rescreened under special circumstances (eg, failure to meet prohibited medication washout requirements, etc). A participant who has not yet received any e-Diary training at Visit 2 
(Preintervention Period) may be rescreened under special circumstances (eg, failure to meet 
prohibited medication washout requirements). All requests for rescreening must be sent to the sponsor and approved by the study physician. Any participant approved for rescreening by the 
study physician will be assigned a new participant identification (PID) and repeat the study 
screening procedures.
6. Study Intervention
Study intervention is defined as any study intervention(s), marketed product(s), or placebo intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study protocol.
Participants meeting the eligibility criteria during the Randomization Visit will be randomized in 
a double-blind fashion to linaclotide or placebo. 
A rationale for selection of the doses is provided in Section 4.3(Justification for Dose).
6.1. Study Intervention(s) Administered
Linaclotide in the form of capsules will be packaged in bottles and provided by the sponsor. 
Study intervention will be administered at the study site during the Randomization Visit and at EOT (Visit 5) after confirming the participant has fasted for at least 2 hours. Participants may eat 
30 minutes after dosing; the requirement is for study intervention to be administered 30 minutes 
before any meal at approximately the same time each day, with the exception of the first dose at Day 1 (Randomization Visit) and last dose at EOT (Week 4/Visit 5) when participants will 
receive the last dose of linaclotide or placebo in the clinic. At this EOT (Week 4/Visit 5) visit, 
participants will arrive in a fasted state for this visit to receive their last dose of study intervention before or after assigned PK sample. Confirmation will be recorded in the source

same time each day.
Study Intervention Name Linaclotide or Placebo
Dosage Formulation Capsules (refer to Study Reference Manual for capsule strength information)
Dose Strength Refer to Section 4.1 for dose information
Route of Administration Oral; capsule contents are to be sprinkled into 20 mL of bottled water, and 5 
mL of this solution is dosed to the participant using an oral syringe. 
Instructions for dosing are provided in Appendix 7 .
Dosing InstructionsSingle dose, once daily at approximately the same time each day, 30 minutes 
before any meal
Packaging and LabelingAll bottles will be labeled with the protocol number, storage information, and 
warning language (“Caution: New Drug—Limited by Federal Law to 
Investigational Use, Keep out of Reach of Children”)
Manufacturer Forest Laboratories Ireland, Limited
Immediately before dispensing the study intervention, the investigator (or appropriately trained designee) will write the participant’s initials, the participant number, and the date on the label.
6.1.1. Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Participant
Participants who continue to meet all eligibility criteria on the Randomization Visit will be 
dispensed the corresponding double-blind study intervention and receive their first dose of study 
intervention at the study site. Participants will receive 1 bottle containing study intervention.
Participants will be instructed to take their assigned dose orally as a single daily dose 30 minutes prior to any meal at approximately the same time each day. 
Participants will be instructed to return the bottle(s) at the next study visit whether there is any 
remaining study intervention or if the bottle is empty per instructions in the Study Reference Manual. Study intervention will be dispensed as per the schedule shown in Section 1.3.
The investigator may allow a participant to stop taking study intervention for up to 3 days because of an intolerable AE. If the investigator believes that the participant is unable to resume dosing after 3 days or requires a suspension of dosing on more than 1 occasion, the investigator 
is required to contact the study physician to discuss the participant’s continued participation in 
the study.
6.2. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
1. The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study intervention received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study intervention.
2. Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study intervention, and only authorized 
site staff may supply or administer study intervention. All study intervention must be stored

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.0in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in 
accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff.
3. The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). 
4. Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study interventions are 
provided in the study reference manual or other specified location.
5. Study interventions in bottles containing capsules must be stored at the study site in an 
appropriate secure area (eg, a locked cabinet in a locked room) at 25°C (77°F); excursions are permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F - 86°F). Keep the product in the original container. Do not subdivide or repackage. Protect from moisture. Do not remove desiccant from the container. Keep bottles tightly closed in a dry place.
6. The investigator or designee is responsible for recording the receipt and use of all study 
interventions supplied and for ensuring the supervision of the storage and allocation of these 
supplies. All unused study interventions and protocol-permitted rescue medication must be 
returned; and, whenever study interventions are returned, unit counts must be performed. All study interventions must be accounted for. At the end of the study, all unused or empty study 
intervention containers should be returned to the sponsor or the local distributor at the 
address provided in the Study Reference Manual.
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
After a parent/LAR/caregiver sign the permission/consent at Screening (Visit 1), study personnel 
will register the participant in the IWRS, and the system will assign the participant a sequential 
PID number. The first participant entered in the system at each study site will be assigned the first number in the sequence by the system. 
!Component 1: Study number (3 digits) = 267
!Component 2: Site number (5 digits) = 10001-19999
!Component 3: Participant number (3 digits) = 001-999
The randomization number encodes the participant’s assignment to 1 of the 2 study intervention groups of the study, according to the randomization schedule generated prior to the study by the 
statistics department at the sponsor. Each participant will be dispensed blinded study 
intervention, labeled with his/her unique PID number, throughout the study.
This PID number will be used to identify the participant throughout the study (ie, at all study 
phases). A detailed description of IWRS procedures is contained in the IWRS Manual in the 
Study Reference Manual.

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.06.3.1. Blinding and Unblinding
6.3.1.1. Blinding
A list of participant randomization codes will be generated by statistical programming and 
implemented by the IWRS vendor (an electronic version will be stored on a secure server). This list will identify each participant by randomization number and include the participant’s corresponding study intervention assignment.
6.3.1.2. Unblinding
Any unblinding at the study site level should be done only in an emergency that requires for the 
study intervention to be identified for the medical management of the participant. In case of an 
emergency, the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participant’s study intervention assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the 
first consideration in making such a determination. If the investigator decides that unblinding is 
warranted, the investigator is encouraged to contact the sponsor prior to unblinding a participant’s study intervention assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the 
participant (see Section 10.3). If a participant’s study intervention assignment is unblinded, the 
sponsor must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The date and reason that the 
blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and eCRF, as applicable. Study 
intervention codes may be broken by Global Patient Safety and Epidemiology for regulatory 
reporting purposes. In such cases, the study staff will be kept blinded and the participant will not need to be disqualified from the study. The unblinding of the bioanalytical representatives is to 
be carried out in a secure manner following the sponsor’s standard operating procedures. 
Extreme care will be taken to ensure no other individuals outside the bioanalytical team will be unblinded.
For IWRS Unblinding
In an emergency, the investigator can obtain the study intervention assignment of any participant 
at his or her study site through the IWRS. In an emergency, the investigator will access the IWRS to break the blind and record the unblinding.
6.4. Study Intervention Compliance
For home dosing, study intervention compliance will be closely monitored by counting the 
number of capsules dispensed and returned. Before dispensing new study intervention at visits 
designated in the SoA, study site personnel will make every effort to collect all unused studyintervention and empty/partially used bottles.
The study site will keep an accurate drug disposition record that specifies the amount of study 
intervention administered to each participant and the date of administration.
Study intervention compliance will be assessed through participant/caregiver and study site staff 
discussion at study visits and recorded on the eCRF. Every effort will be made to collect all 
unused study intervention at the final visit.

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.06.5. Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Prior medicine is defined as any medicine taken before the date of the first dose of study 
intervention. Concomitant medication is defined as any medication taken on or after the date of the first dose of study intervention. Any medication started after last dose date of study 
intervention will not be included in the summary of concomitant medications but will be 
included in listing.
The use of both prior and concomitant medications will be summarized as the number and 
proportion of participants who took a particular medicine within each therapeutic class. Multiple 
medicine use by a participant in the same category (based on Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification) will only be counted once.
Medication history during the previous 3 months will be recorded at Screening (Visit 1) in the 
eCRF. Any changes in concomitant medicines or new medicines added will be recorded in the eCRF at visits throughout the study.
6.5.1. Prohibited Interventions and Washout Before the Study
Prohibited Medications
All medicines listed in the sections below (1-day washout and 14-day washout) will be excluded 
during the Preintervention, Intervention, and Postintervention Periods. A 1-day washout means 
that the particular medicine is not allowed during the calendar day before the Preintervention
Visit; a 14-day washout means that the particular medicine is not allowed during the 14 calendar days before the Preintervention Visit.
1-Day Washout
1. Any over-the-counter or prescription laxative, suppository, or enema (eg, polyethylene 
glycol, lactulose, Fleet enema) and any herbal or natural agent that might be taken for 
constipation. (Note: The use of fiber, bulk laxatives, stool softeners [surfactants such as docusate], and probiotics is acceptable, provided that the participant has been on a stable dose for 30 days before Screening (Visit 1) and plans to continue stable dosing for the duration of the study)
2. Any medicine used to treat diarrhea (eg, bismuth subsalicylate, kaolin)
14-Day Washout
1. Drugs with known pharmacologic activity at 5-HT4, 5-HT2b or 5-HT3 receptors 
(eg, cisapride, tegaserod, prucalopride, ondansetron, tropisetron, granisetron,

!The occurrence of any other AE that in the opinion of the investigator or the sponsor is possibly related or related to the study intervention that represents a clinically significant 
safety risk to the participant
Additionally, discontinuation of study intervention for abnormal liver function should be considered by the investigator when a participant meets the criteria for Hy’s law or the appearance of abnormal laboratory test results suggesting severe drug-induced liver injury (DILI) (refer to Appendix 9 ), or if the investigator believes that it is in the best interest of the 
participant.
All enrolled participants who prematurely discontinue from the study, regardless of cause, should 
be seen for the assessments to be completed at the EOT Visit. The EOT assessments are defined 
as completion of evaluations scheduled for all participants. 
Participants who discontinue from the study and do not return to the study site for EOT Visit 
must be requested in writing to return to the study site for procedures required at the EOT Visit 
as defined in the SoA and return any unused study intervention. A copy of the letter, together with the source documentation, will be kept in the investigator’s files. The reason for premature 
discontinuation from the study will be recorded on the Study Termination Page of the eCRF. 
Study site staff will be contacted by the sponsor after each premature discontinuation to ensure proper characterization of the reason for discontinuation is captured.
See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation and follow-
up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.
7.1.2. Criteria for Consideration of Study Discontinuation

Participants in this study who prematurely discontinue study intervention will not be replaced.
7.3. Lost to Follow-Up
A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit:
!The site must attempt to contact the participant/parent/LAR and reschedule the missed visit 
as soon as possible and counsel them on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the 
study.
!Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant/parent/LAR (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or

8. Study Assessments and Procedures
A detailed listing of study assessments by day is presented in Appendix 8 .
!Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA. Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed.
!Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention.
!Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct.
!All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.
!Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood count) and obtained before signing of the informed consent form (ICF) may be utilized for 
screening or baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol-specified criteria 
and were performed within the timeframe defined in the SoA.
!The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the study will not exceed 12 mL. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the sample.
!Additional details regarding study conduct during the novel coronavirus pandemic areprovided in Appendix 10.
8.1. Efficacy Assessments
An observer-reported outcome (ObsRO) instrument assessing key signs and symptoms of FC for use in children (2 to 5 years of age) with FC was developed by Allergan and Ironwood Pharmaceuticals based on extensive qualitative research with caregivers of children with FC, as 
well as feedback from pediatric gastroenterologists, measurement experts, and health authorities. 
The ObsRO instrument was developed for completion by caregivers on an electronic diary (eDiary). Data collected in the eDiary will be used to derive the efficacy endpoints.
All efficacy assessments will be determined by responses entered in the eDiary by the caregiver.
The caregiver is identified as the individual who completes the eDiary and should be the same individual throughout the course of the study and must be able to read and understand the eDiary

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.0as a condition for study participation (Inclusion Criterion 3.02). At the start of the 
Preintervention Period, caregivers will receive full training in the use and completion of the eDiary at the study visit in which they are given the eDiary device. If the caregiver completing 
the diary changes, the study team should be notified and should document the date when it 
changed and who the new caregiver is. The new caregiver must also provide written informed consent before the initiation of any study-specific procedures.
8.1.1. Key Efficacy Assessments
The key efficacy assessments, which will be used to determine the efficacy parameter of SBM 
frequency, are the items assessing BM frequency and rescue medication use. Caregivers will report their child’s BM frequency (the number of BMs) by responding to the following: 
Bowel Movement Frequency
Rescue medication use
Stool Consistency (Bristol Stool Form Scale)
If the caregiver was present for the BM, he/she will be asked to rate the child’s observed stool 
consistency for each BM he/she was present for. 
Stool consistency will be based on the BSFS. The BSFS is a widely used measurement of stool 
consistency ( Lewis 1997). Caregivers will use the BSFS 7-point ordinal scale to rate their child’s 
stool consistency as follows:
!"Choose the option that is most like the Xth (eg, 1
st, 2nd, 3rd, ...) bowel movement you were 
with the child for"
oType 1: Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass)
oType 2: Sausage-shaped, but lumpy
oType 3: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface
oType 4: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft
oType 5: Soft blobs with clear cut edges (easy to pass)
oType 6: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool
oType 7: Watery, no solid pieces. Entirely liquid

Modified Rome III Criteria
Modified Rome III criteria will be assessed by the investigator at the Screening Visit (Visit 1) 
and at the end of the study intervention period at the EOT Visit (Visit 5). A participant will be 
considered as fulfilling modified Rome III criteria if a “yes” response is recorded to the overall question of whether the participant meets modified Rome III criteria for functional constipation. 
For the EOT assessment, these criteria will be assessed over the 4-week double-blind study 
intervention period. In the event a participant discontinues the study prematurely, these criteria will be assessed over the duration of time the participant received double-blind study intervention.
Global Items
Assessments of global change in symptoms and global severity of symptoms will be completed 
weekly in the eDiary.
The global items consist of 2 items, 1 assessing global change in the child’s symptoms and 1 
assessing the global severity of the child’s symptoms. Both global items will be completed 
weekly on the eDiary by the caregiver. The global severity item will be completed beginning at 
the Preintervention Period through the End of Study and the global change item will be completed from 1 week after randomization through the End of Study.

Participants must be evaluated by a physician or an appropriately trained health care professional 
at every visit and the evaluation must be documented. The procedures discussed below will be completed at the designated visits. Safety assessments should not be administered to the participant unless the participant is accompanied by his or her consented caregiver.
The safety assessments will include monitoring of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory 
assessments (clinical chemistry, complete blood count [CBC], urinalysis), vital sign 
measurements (including postural vital signs), electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical 
examinations, height, and weight. Evidence of severe diarrhea, especially when accompanied by dehydration, volume depletion and/or significant electrolyte or ECG abnormalities will be actively monitored throughout.
All AEs will be monitored until symptom resolution or until the condition stabilizes. A DMSB
will oversee AEs and safety of the overall study (Section 10.1.6.3).

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.08.2.1. Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination will be done at screening and at the Week 4/EOT Visit by a 
professionally trained physician or health professional listed on Form FDA 1572 or the Delegation of Authority log and licensed to perform physical examinations. Physical 
examinations may be repeated at the investigator’s discretion. If fecal impaction is documented 
during an optional repeat physical examination, the study physician must be notified.
Any new physical examination abnormalities for the post-baseline physical examination or 
worsening of the change from Screening (Visit 1) will be reported as an AE. 
!A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of general 
appearance, skin, HEENT (head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat), neck, thorax/lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen, musculoskeletal, lymph nodes, neurologic (including mental status), and visual inspection of the lumbosacral and perianal region. 
!Breast and genitourinary examinations are optional at the discretion of the investigator
!Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses.
In addition to the physical examination, a fecal impaction assessment will be performed for all participants at both Screening (Visit 1) and Randomization (Visit 3) prior to randomization and 
dosing. Fecal impaction is defined as a hard mass in the lower abdomen identified on physical 
examination or a dilated rectum filled with a large amount of stool on rectal examination. If a rectal examination is performed, the medically qualified site personnel should assess for and document the presence of anal wink and normal anal tone. 
!If fecal impaction is identified at Screening (Visit 1), participants will receive a disimpaction 
regimen with either oral or rectal medication. The choice of treatment will be determined by the investigator after discussing the options with the participant and the caregiver. Options will include any over-the-counter or prescription laxative, suppository, or enema (eg, polyethylene glycol, lactulose, Fleet enema). After the participant has received treatment for the impaction, the investigator must re-evaluate the participant for the presence of fecal impaction at the Preintervention Visit (Visit 2). If there is no fecal impaction at the Preintervention Visit, the participant may enter the Preintervention Period after adhering to any washout requirements (Section 10.8.2). If fecal impaction is present upon re-
examination, the participant will not be eligible for the study (ie, they have failed their out-patient clean-out regimen). 
!If fecal impaction is present upon examination at Randomization (Visit 3), the participant will not be eligible to be randomized into the study.

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.08.2.2. Vital Signs 
Vital signs and postural vital signs will be obtained and documented as noted in the SOA (see 
Section 1.3). Vital signs will be assessed as follows:
Vital signs include weight, temperature (oral, rectal, or tympanic), and respiratory rate; postural 
vital signs (supine and standing) include pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
Temperature may be recorded as oral, rectal or tympanic (ear). If possible, temperature should be obtained using the same method throughout the course of the study.
At all visits, postural vital signs must be obtained after participants have been in a supine 
position for at least 2 to 3 minutes, followed by a standing position for at least 1 minute.
8.2.3. Electrocardiograms
A standard 12-lead ECG will be performed at Screening (Visit 1) and at the Week 4/EOT Visit. 
ECGs will be performed and electronically transmitted to a central ECG laboratory for analysis 
according to the instructions provided by the central ECG laboratory. Measurements (in msec) will be recorded for the following parameters: heart rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, 
and uncorrected QT interval. QTcB (Bazett-corrected QT interval) and QTcF 
(Fridericia-corrected QT interval) will be calculated.
Participants with clinically significant ECG abnormalities considered to be secondary to diarrhea 
(ie, an AESI) must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours, on an SAE form if considered to 
be serious. Non-serious events do not require submission on an SAE form; rather, these events only need to be entered into the eCRF (Section 10.3). If the AE is assessed as causally related to 
the use of study intervention, the participant should be discontinued from the study; however, the study physician and investigator may discuss individual participants and AEs to make this determination (Section 10.3).
The overall interpretation and determination of the clinical relevance of ECG findings using the central ECG interpretation report will be recorded in the participant’s eCRF.
Sites shall transmit all study-required ECGs obtained to the ECG vendor. All ECGs performed 
during a given visit should be recorded on the repeating eCRF in the respective visit. 
Unscheduled ECGs are recorded for unscheduled visits only. All readable ECGs received by the vendor shall be sent for cardiologist over-read. The sponsor will receive all ECG data, including cardiologist assessments and ECGs that could not be evaluated.
8.2.4. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
!See Section 10.2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and the SoA 
(Section 1.3) for the timing and frequency.
!At Screening (Visit 1), the investigator will assess the clinical significance of any values 
outside the reference ranges provided by the laboratory, and participants with abnormalities judged to be clinically significant will be excluded from the study.
!The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the eCRF. The

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.0laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.
!All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significant during participation in the study or within 30 days after the last dose of study intervention should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator or medical safety physician.
oIf such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by the investigator, the etiology should be identified, and the sponsor notified.
oAll protocol-required laboratory assessments, as defined in Section 10.2, must be 
conducted in accordance with the SoA and the laboratory manual.
oIf laboratory values from non-protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at the institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the eCRF.
!Participants with clinically significant electrolyte abnormalities that are considered to be secondary to diarrhea (ie, an AE of special interest) must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours on an SAE form if considered to be serious. Non-serious events do not require submission on an SAE form; rather, these events only need to be entered into the eCRF (Section 10.3). If the AE is assessed as causally related to the use of study 
intervention, the participant should be discontinued from the study; however, the study physician and investigator may discuss individual participants and AEs to make this determination (Section 10.3).
!A central laboratory will be used to evaluate all blood samples, which will be collected, processed, and stored according to the instructions provided by the laboratory.
8.3. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product (ICH-E2A). The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Section 10.3.
AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant’s parent/legally authorized representative).
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following

caused the participant to discontinue the study (see Section 7).
Particular attention must be given to the AE of diarrhea, which was the most frequently reported AE in the adult linaclotide program. Please refer to Section 10.3 for details about AE reporting.   
Examples of AEs are as follows:
!Changes in the general condition of the participant
!Subjective symptoms offered by or elicited from the participant
!Objective signs observed by the investigator or other study site personnel
!All diseases that occur after signing the informed consent, including any change in severity 
or frequency of preexisting disease
!All clinically relevant abnormalities in laboratory values or clinically relevant physical 
findings that occur during the study schedule
Please note medical procedures scheduled prior to consenting, but occurring during the study, should not be captured as AEs, but should be listed in the medical history if related to a pre-existing condition.
8.3.1. Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs)
AESIs are defined as significant volume depletion and/or significant electrolyte abnormalities 
and/or ECG abnormalities that are considered by the investigator or sponsor to be related to diarrhea. The investigator should contact the sponsor if there is any question whether the 
criterion for an AESIs has been met. All AESIs must be reported to the sponsor as described in 
Section 10.3.
8.3.2. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Events, Serious Adverse 
Events, and Adverse Events of Special Interest Information
At each visit, participants are to be queried regarding any AEs or SAEs that have occurred since 
the previous visit. Participants will be asked to volunteer information with a nonleading question 
such as, “How do you feel since your last visit?” Study site personnel will record all pertinent information in the participant’s eCRF. All SAE from the signing of the ICF until 30 days after 
the last dose of study intervention will be collected at the timepoints specified in the SoA 
(Section 1.3), and as observed or reported spontaneously by study participants.
All AEs from the signing of the ICF until 30 days after the last dose of study intervention will be 
collected at the timepoints specified in the SoA (Section 1.3), and as observed or reported 
spontaneously by study participants.
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study intervention, but after obtaining 
informed consent will be recorded in the AE section of the eCRF.

not require submission on an SAE form; rather, these events only need to be entered into the 
eCRF. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it 
being available.
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE information after conclusion of the 
study participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE including a death, at any time 
after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor.
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section 10.3.
8.3.3. Method of Detecting Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Adverse 
Events of Special Interest
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences.
8.3.4. Follow-up of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Adverse Events of 
Special Interest
After the initial AE/ SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All AE/ SAE and non-serious AEs of special interest (as 
defined in Section 10.3) will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3). If a follow-up visit is 
deemed necessary for appropriate safety surveillance, it will take place within 30 days of the 
final protocol-defined study visit.
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the sponsor to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include 
additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF.
The investigator will submit any updated SAE and AESI data to the sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.
8.3.5. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events
!Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a 
study intervention under clinical investigation are met.

linaclotide
55
GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.0!The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs/ IECs, and investigators. 
!Investigator safety reports must be prepared for SUSARs according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary.
!An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review 
and then file it along with the investigator’s brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
At each visit, participants are to be queried regarding any AEs or SAEs that have occurred since the previous visit. Participants will be asked to volunteer information with a nonleading question such as, “How do you feel since your last visit?” Study site personnel will record all pertinent 
information in the participant’s eCRF. Any AEs reported in diaries will also be reported on the 
relevant eCRF page.
Additional information is provided in Section 10.3 for the recording and follow-up of AEs and 
SAEs.
8.3.6. Potential Hy’s Law Cases
Criteria for possible Hy’s law cases are as follows:
!ALT or AST ≥ 3 × upper limit of normal [ULN] AND
!Total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN AND
!ALP < 2 × ULN
Study site personnel must report every participant who meets the criteria for potential Hy’s law 
as SAEs (see Appendix 9 for a detailed description on handling potential Hy’s law cases and 
liver toxicity). Typically, all 3 analytes will be obtained from the same sample, but they may 
come from multiple samples taken within a 24-hour period. This requirement applies from the 
time the participant signs the ICF for the study until 30 days after the last known dose of study intervention.
Additional details regarding liver safety assessments and follow-up are provided in Appendix 9.
8.3.7. Medication Errors
Medication error refers to any unintended error in the dosing and/or administration of the study 
intervention as per instructions in the protocol. Medication errors generally fall into 4 categories as follows:
!Wrong study drug
!Wrong dose (including dosing regimen, strength, form, concentration, amount)
!Wrong route of administration
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol LIN-MD-67, Amendment 1
linaclotide
56
GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.0!Wrong participant (ie, not administered to the intended participant)
Medication errors include occurrences of overdose and underdose of the study intervention.
Overdose: Unintentional administration of a quantity of the study intervention given per 
administration or per day that is above the maximum recommended dose according to the 
reference safety information or protocol for the study intervention or comparator as applicable. 
This also takes into account cumulative effects due to overdose. 
Underdose: Unintentional administration of a quantity of the study intervention given per 
administration or per day that is under the minimum recommended dose according to the 
reference safety information or protocol. 
8.4. Treatment of Overdose
The sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose. 
In the event of an overdose, the investigator should:
1. Contact the medical safety physician (MSP) immediately.
2. Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities until study 
treatment can no longer be detected systemically.
3. Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose in the 
site’s source documents for the participant.
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in 
consultation with the MSP based on the clinical evaluation of the participant.
8.5. Pharmacokinetics
An important consideration is whether oral bioavailability of linaclotide is similar in children as in adults or whether systemic exposure may be higher in children. Sparse PK sampling will 
therefore be included in this study to assess the PK of linaclotide in children. Sparse PK blood 
samples will be collected at the pre-specified times to determine plasma concentration of linaclotide and its active metabolite (MM-419447).
8.5.1. Blood Pharmacokinetic Sampling Procedure
Participants in Cohorts 1-3 will be randomized on Study Day 1 (Visit 3) at a 1:3 ratio to either a 
pre-dose or post-dose PK sample and the 6 participants in the final cohort will be randomized at a 1:2 ratio to either a pre-dose or post-dose PK sample, respectively, to be completed before or 
after the last dose of study intervention at Visit 5 (Week 4) for determination of linaclotide and 
active metabolite (MM-419447) concentrations in plasma. One blood sample will be collected from each participant at Visit 5 (Week 4) before or after the last dose of study intervention, along 
with all laboratory blood samples at same time. Postintervention PK sample will be collected at 1 
to 8 hours post-dose.

Manual.
All participants will be instructed to hold their last dose of linaclotide/placebo for Visit 5 
(Week 4) and will take their dose at the site that day in a fasted state. Every attempt should be made to ensure that the dosing time during Visit 5 (Week 4) is consistent with the time 
linaclotide has been taken during the course of the study intervention. Sites will also be 
instructed to encourage caregivers to schedule Visit 5 (Week 4) early in the study once the participant is randomized as the participants will need to take linaclotide in a fasted state 
(Section 10.8.3). Sites will also document the date and time of the dose administered prior to the 
PK sample collection.
8.5.2. Pharmacokinetic Sample Bioanalysis
Plasma concentrations of linaclotide and its active metabolite (MM-419447) will be determined 
using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method.

!Proportion of participants who no longer fulfill modified Rome III criteria for functional 
constipation at the end of the Study Intervention Period.
!Proportion of participants with each individual item score for the global change in 
symptoms and the global severity of symptoms at each week during the Study Intervention Period.
9.2. Sample Size Determination
Up to 30 participants, 2 to 5 years of age, will be sequentially enrolled into LIN-MD-67; 8 
participants each into Cohorts 1 to 3 will be randomly assigned with 3:1 allocation ratio either to 
linaclotide dose or matching placebo and 6 additional participants in the final cohort will be randomly assigned with 5:1 allocation ratio either to linaclotide dose or matching placebo. 
Participants will be randomly assigned to receive linaclotide or matching placebo as described in 
Section 4.1. 
Sample size in this study is not driven by any statistical consideration. Instead, this study is 
designed to enroll sufficient pediatric participants to observe the clinical response trends and
monitor safety.
9.3. Populations for Analyses
Four analysis populations will be defined as follows:
!Screened population includes all participants who undergo Screening (Visit 1) and receive a 
PID number.
!Randomized population includes all participants in the Screened population who are randomized to a study intervention group.
!Safety population includes all participants in the Randomized population who receive at least 
1 dose of double-blind study intervention. Participants will be summarized according to the 
study intervention they actually receive for all safety analysis variables/endpoints.
!Modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population includes all participants in the Randomized population who receive at least 1 dose of double-blind study intervention and who had at least 1 postbaseline entry on BM characteristic assessments that determine occurrences of 
SBMs (ie, BM frequency and rescue medication use). Participants will be summarized 
according to the randomized study intervention for all efficacy analysis variables/endpoints.

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.09.4. Statistical Analyses
The SAP will be developed and finalized before database lock and unblinding and will describe 
the participant populations to be included in the analyses, and procedures for accounting for missing data. This section is a summary of the main feature for the planned statistical analyses in this study.
9.4.1. Efficacy Analyses
All efficacy analyses will be performed based on the mITT population. Baseline values for efficacy parameters related to daily eDiary responses will be derived from 
the eDiary in the Preintervention Period, specifically the period of time from 14 days before randomization up to the time of randomization. The numerator of the baseline weekly SBM rate will be derived based on the total number of caregiver-observed SBMs a participant had during this period. Caregiver-observed SBMs are defined as SBMs reported in the eDiary for which the caregiver identified being with the child for.
Baseline stool consistency reported by the caregiver based on daily assessments will be 
calculated as a mean of the participant’s non-missing BSFS scores from each caregiver-observed SBM during this period. Baseline straining score reported by the caregiver will be calculated as a mean of the participant’s non-missing daily average straining score  
 from caregiver-observed SBMs during this period. A participant’s 
baseline stool consistency and straining reported by the caregiver cannot be assessed if theparticipant does not have at least 1 caregiver-observed SBM during the Preintervention Period. For participants with no caregiver-observed SBMs reported in the eDiary during a study period, the consistency and straining assessments reported by caregiver will be considered missing for that study period in the analyses. Participants with missing baseline consistency and straining reported by the caregiver will be excluded from the respective consistency and straining change from baseline analyses.
Baseline value for the global severity in symptoms will be based on the last non-missing 
assessment on or before the date of first dose of study intervention.
An observed-cases approach to missing postbaseline data will be applied. The descriptive 
statistics for efficacy endpoints including placebo and the corresponding linaclotide dose in each 
cohort will be provided to evaluate the main objective of this study. No statistical testing will be 
performed to compare linaclotide dose with placebo. No multiplicity adjustment will be applied in this dose-ranging study. 
Descriptive statistics for continuous endpoints in terms of mean, median, standard deviation, 
standard error of mean, minimum, and maximum will be provided for placebo and corresponding linaclotide dose within each cohort. For categorical endpoints, count and percentages will be provided for placebo and corresponding linaclotide dose within each cohort.
If any cohort has linaclotide dose similar to the other cohort, summary statistics will be provided
for these efficacy parameters combining the participants from similar dose cohorts. Any additional analysis will be discussed further in Statistical Analysis Plan.

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.09.4.1.1. Key Efficacy Endpoints
Change from baseline in 4-week overall SBM frequency rate (SBMs/week) during the 
Study Intervention Period of each cohort
The numerator of the SBM rate (SBMs/week) during the Study Intervention Period of each 
cohort will be derived based on the total number of SBMs reported by a caregiver as being 
directly observed during this period in the eDiary. Additional analysis will also be performed based on the total number of SBMs reported during the Study Intervention Period (including 
SBMs not directly observed by the caregiver) and the corresponding baseline SBM frequency 
rate will be determined based on the total number of SBMs reported during the Preintervention period.
Change from Baseline in 4-Week Stool Consistency Reported by the Caregiver During the 
Intervention Period of Each Cohort
Stool consistency for each caregiver-observed BM will be measured daily in the eDiary using the 
7-point ordinal BSFS. A participant’s BSFS score for the Study Intervention Period will be the 
average of the non-missing BSFS scores from the caregiver-observed SBMs during the 4-week Study Intervention Period. If no caregiver-observed SBMs are present at baseline, the baseline 
BSFS score reported by caregiver will be missing and, therefore, that participant will not be 
included in the change from baseline stool consistency analysis.
Change from Baseline in 4-Week Straining Reported by the Caregiver During Study 
Intervention Period for Each Cohort
Straining for each caregiver-observed BM will be collected daily in the eDiary device, using a 
4-point scale based on two questions as discussed in Section 8.1.1. The participant’s daily 
straining score for each caregiver-observed BM will be derived based on the average of non-missing responses of the two straining questions. The participant’s straining score in the 4-week Study Intervention Period will be the average of the non-missing daily average straining scores 
from the caregiver-observed SBMs during the 4-week Study Intervention Period for each cohort. 
If a participant has no caregiver-observed SBMs at baseline, then the baseline straining score reported by the caregiver will be missing and, therefore, that participant will not be included in the change from baseline straining analysis.
Proportion of days with fecal incontinence during study intervention period (for 
participants who have acquired toileting skills during daytime and nighttime or acquired toileting skills during daytime only) within each cohort
Fecal incontinence will be collected daily in the eDiary. Any "yes" response for the question 
 will be counted as presence of fecal incontinence
in the corresponding day (Section 8.1.1).

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.09.4.1.2. Other Efficacy Endpoints
Proportion of participants who no longer fulfill modified Rome III criteria for functional 
constipation at the end of the study intervention period
Modified Rome III criteria will be assessed by the investigator at the Screening Visit (Visit 1) 
and at the end of the study intervention period at the EOT Visit (Visit 5). A participant will be 
considered as fulfilling modified Rome III criteria if a “yes” response is recorded to the overall question of whether the participant meets modified Rome III criteria for functional constipation. 
For the EOT assessment, these criteria will be assessed over the 4-week double-blind study 
intervention period. In the event a participant discontinues the study prematurely, these criteria will be assessed over the duration of time the participant received double-blind study intervention (Section 8.1.2 ).
Proportion of participants with each individual item score for the global change in symptoms and the global severity of symptoms at each week during the study intervention period
The global change in symptoms and the global severity of symptoms will be assessed on a 
weekly basis in the eDiary with a 7-point scale and a 5-point scale respectively as discussed in Section 8.1.2.
9.4.2. Safety Analyses
The safety analysis will be performed using the safety population. The safety parameters will 
include AEs, clinical laboratory parameters, vital sign measurements, weight, and ECG 
parameters. For each safety parameter, the last non-missing assessment made before the first 
dose of double-blind study intervention will be used as the baseline for all analyses of that safety parameter.
Safety summaries will be provided for each cohort separately. If any cohort has a similar 
linaclotide dose with another cohort, the safety summaries will also be provided combining participants from the similar dose cohorts, as appropriate. 
9.4.2.1. Adverse Events
An AE will be considered a TEAE if:
!The AE began on or after the date of the first dose of study intervention; or
!The AE was present before the date of the first dose of study intervention, but increased in 
severity or became serious on or after the date of the first dose of study intervention
An AE that occurs more than 1 day after the last dose of study intervention will not be counted as a TEAE.
An AE will be considered a treatment-emergent SAE if it is a TEAE that additionally meets any 
SAE criteria.

The number and percentage of participants reporting treatment-related TEAEs in each study 
intervention group will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term within each cohort.
If more than 1 AE is coded to the same preferred term for the same participant, the participant 
will be counted only once for that preferred term using the most severe and most related 
occurrence for the summarizations by severity and by causal relationship to study intervention.
Listings of all AEs , SAEs, AESIs, and AEs leading to discontinuation by participant will be 
presented.
The definitions of an AE and SAE can be found in Section 10.3.
9.4.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Assessments
Descriptive statistics for clinical laboratory values (in SI units) at baseline (screening) and 
changes from baseline at each assessment time point will be presented by study intervention 
group within each cohort.
The criteria for potentially clinically significant (PCS) laboratory values will be detailed in the 
SAP. The number and percentage of participants who have PCS postbaseline clinical laboratory 
values within the corresponding cohort during the double-blind study intervention period will be tabulated by study intervention. The percentages will be calculated relative to the number of 
participants who have available non-PCS baseline values and at least 1 postbaseline assessment 
for the double-blind Study Intervention Period of the corresponding cohort. The numerator will be the total number of participants with available non-PCS baseline values and at least 1 PCS 
postbaseline value during the double-blind Study Intervention Period of the corresponding 
cohort. A supportive listing of participants with PCS postbaseline values will be provided for the safety population. 
9.4.2.3. Vital Signs
Descriptive statistics for weight and postural vital signs (supine and standing systolic and 
diastolic BP and pulse rate), respiration rate, and temperature at baseline and changes from 
baseline at each assessment time point will be presented by study intervention group within each 
cohort. 
Vital sign values will be considered PCS within the corresponding cohort if they meet both the 
observed-value criteria and the change-from-baseline-value criteria that will be detailed in the 
SAP. The number and percentage of participants who have PCS postbaseline vital sign values will be tabulated by study intervention within the double-blind Study Intervention Period and 
Postintervention Period separately for the corresponding cohort. The percentages will be 
calculated relative to the number of participants who have available non-PCS baseline values and at least 1 postbaseline assessment in the specific period for the corresponding cohort. The 
numerator will be the total number of participants with at least 1 PCS postbaseline value during

Descriptive statistics for ECG parameters (ie, ventricular heart rate, RR interval, PR interval, 
QRS interval, QT interval, and QTc) at baseline and changes from baseline values at each 
assessment time point will be presented by study intervention group within each cohort. The QTc is calculated using both the Bazett and Fridericia corrections.
The number and percentage of participants with PCS postbaseline ECG values will be tabulated 
by study intervention group within the corresponding cohort. The criteria for PCS ECG values will be detailed in the SAP. The percentages will be calculated relative to the number of 
participants with available non-PCS baseline values and at least one postbaseline assessment for 
the double-blind Study Intervention Period within the corresponding cohort. The numerator will be the total number of participants with available non-PCS baseline values and at least one PCS 
postbaseline value during the double-blind Study Intervention Period of the corresponding 
cohort. A supportive listing of participants with PCS postbaseline values will be provided for the safety population. 
9.4.3. Pharmacokinetic Analyses
Individual plasma concentrations of linaclotide and its active metabolite (MM-419447) will be 
listed by participant. Summary statistics of plasma concentrations for each analyte will be provided by dose group and time after the most recent dose if there are sufficient data to perform 
such an evaluation. In addition, population PK parameters of linaclotide and MM-419447 may 
be calculated via population PK modeling if data permits.

!Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of this study must be retained by the investigator for at least 15 years after study completion unless local regulations or institutional policies require a longer retention period. No records may be 
destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of the sponsor. No records 
may be transferred to another location or party without written notification to the sponsor. 
10.1.6.1. Data Monitoring
Before any participant enters the study, a representative of the sponsor will meet with the 
investigator and the study site staff to review the procedures to be followed during the study. 
Electronic data capture (EDC) functionality training is provided via computer-based training to train investigators and authorized designees on recording the data in the eCRFs using the EDC 
system. After the first participant is enrolled, the sponsor’s representative, a Regional Site 
Manager or designee, will periodically monitor the progress of the study by conducting on-site visits. This Regional Site Manager or designee will review query statuses remotely, possibly 
warranting more frequent communication and/or site visits with the investigator and the study 
site staff. The investigator will make available to the Regional Site Manager or designee source documents (written notes and electronic medical records, if used), signed consent forms, and all 
other study-related documents. The investigator and the study site staff will be responsible for 
data entry of participant data into the eCRFs via the EDC system, resolving data queries generated via the EDC system and providing missing or corrected data. The investigator or 
designee will be responsible for approving all changes performed on the data and endorsing the 
participant data within the EDC system. This approval method will include applying an electronic signature linked to a uniquely assigned username and password that together will represent a traditional handwritten signature used in the past.

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.0The study site staff will be fully trained by a representative of the eDiary vendor on the use of 
the eDiary device and how to train caregivers in the use of the eDiary device (ie, how to complete their daily assessments and download their data). The study site staff will then be 
responsible for ensuring that all caregivers enrolled in the study are given full training and 
support materials in relation to the completion of the eDiary. 
10.1.6.2. Data Recording and Documentation
Data collection will involve the use of the sponsor’s EDC system, to which only authorized 
personnel will have access. Participant’s data are to be entered into the EDC system by the 
investigator or designee using their assigned EDC user account. After data entry into the EDC system by the investigator or designee, a combination of manual and programmatic edit checks 
will be used to review the data for completeness, logic, and adherence to study protocol. As a 
result of these edits checks, data monitoring and reviews; queries may be electronically issued to the site and should be answered electronically via the EDC system.
Each query will carry identifying information (assigned username, date and time) to assist the 
sponsor and the investigator on the origin of the data clarification request and the response provided by the investigator. All data changes made to the participant’s data via a data query will be approved by the investigator prior to final database lock.
After all data have been reviewed and all issues have been resolved, the database will be locked.
All data collected in the context of this study will be stored and evaluated per regulatory 
requirements and applicable guidance for electronic records. Also, data will be stored and 
evaluated in such a way as to guarantee participant confidentiality in accordance with the legal stipulations applying to confidentiality of data. Study records (eg, copies of eCRFs, laboratory 
reports, eDiaries, regulatory documents) will be retained at the site, along with adequate source 
documentation, according to FDA and ICH requirements. All study records must be available for inspection by the sponsor, its authorized representatives, and health authorities.
10.1.6.3. Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)
An independent DSMB will review unblinded interim safety data at defined intervals throughout 
the study or ad hoc if needed. The DSMB will communicate their recommendations to the 
sponsor after each meeting but will serve in an advisory capacity only; the Board will not be 
empowered to stop the study or require changes in the protocol. Further details of the DSMB (composition, policy, and procedures) are specified in a separate DSMB Charter.
10.1.7. Source Documents
!Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate the 
integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator’s site.
!Data reported on the CRF or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents 
must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The 
investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study.

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.010.1.8. Study and Site Closure
The sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time 
for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study-site closure visit has been performed.
The investigator may initiate study-site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are 
not limited to:
!Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC or 
local health authorities, the sponsor’s procedures, or GCP guidelines
!Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator
!Discontinuation of further study intervention development
10.1.9. Publication Policy
!Allergan, as the sponsor, and its partner, Ironwood, have proprietary interest in this study. 
Authorship and manuscript composition will reflect joint cooperation between multiple investigators and sites and Allergan personnel. Authorship will be established prior to the writing of the manuscript. As this study involves multiple centers, no individual publications 
will be allowed prior to completion of the final report of the multicenter study except as 
agreed with Allergan.
!The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results. In accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will generally supportpublication of multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data.
!Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International Committee 
of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements.
10.1.10. Compliance with Protocol
The investigator is responsible for compliance with the protocol at the investigational site. A 
representative of the sponsor will make frequent contact with the investigator and his/her 
research staff and will conduct regular monitoring visits at the site to review participant and study intervention accountability records for compliance with the protocol. Protocol deviations 
will be discussed with the investigator upon identification. The use of the data collected for the 
participant will be discussed to determine if the data are to be included in the analysis. The investigator will enter data that may be excluded from analysis as defined by the protocol 
deviation specifications. Significant protocol deviations will be reported to the IRB/IEC 
according to the IRB/IEC’s reporting requirements.
Deviating from the protocol is permitted only if absolutely necessary for the safety or clinical 
management of the participants and must immediately be reported to the sponsor. Protocol

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.010.2. Appendix 2: Clinical Laboratory Tests
Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory tests will be collected as detailed in the SOA 
(Section 1.3). During the Screening Period, the investigator will assess the clinical significance 
of any values that are outside the reference ranges provided by the central laboratory. 
Participants with abnormalities judged to be clinically significant will be excluded from the 
study.
Participants with clinically significant electrolyte abnormalities that are considered to be 
secondary to diarrhea (ie, an AESI) must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours on an SAE 
form if considered to be serious. Non-serious events do not require submission on an SAE form; rather, these events only need to be entered into the eCRF (Section 10.3). If the AE is assessed as 
causally related to the use of study intervention, the participant should be discontinued from the study; however, the sponsor and investigator may discuss individual participants and AEs to make this determination.
Clinical laboratory levels that will be measured are summarized in Table 10–1 .
Laboratory assessments may be repeated at any visit if there was an abnormal finding at the most 
recent previous evaluation or if additional information is clinically necessary to appropriately evaluate the participant’s current condition, follow up, and/or manage an adverse experience.
A central laboratory will be used to evaluate all urine and blood samples, which will be 
collected, processed, and stored according to the instructions provided by the laboratory. 
Protocol-specific requirements for inclusion or exclusion of participants are detailed in Section 5
of the protocol.
Additional tests may be performed at any time during the study as determined necessary by the 
investigator or required by local regulations.

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.0c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at 
least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or intervention that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether hospitalization occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.
Hospitalization for elective intervention of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.
d. Results in persistent disability/incapacity
!The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions.
!This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f. Other situations:
!Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious.
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive intervention in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
All cancers that occur during a study are considered SAEs and will be documented and reported 
per Section 10.3.

The schedule of study procedures and assessments is tabulated by visit in the SOA in 
Section 1.3. The descriptions of the procedures to be performed at each visit are provided below.
10.8.1. Screening (Visit 1)
The Screening Period will occur 4 to 7 weeks before Randomization (Visit 3/Day 1) and last for 
14 to 28 days during which time study procedures will be reviewed with the 
parent/guardian/LAR, and caregiver; and parent/guardian/LAR and caregiver consent will be obtained and documented (Section 10.1.3). After informed consent is obtained, participants will 
be registered in IWRS and assigned a unique PID number (Section 6.3). A review of 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and other screening assessments will be conducted to determine the participant’s eligibility for enrollment (Sections 5.1and5.2).
At Screening (Visit 1) the following procedures will be performed:
!Review inclusion and exclusion criteria
!Complete modified Rome III assessment
!Register participants in IWRS 
!Obtain medical history and current medication status
!Perform a physical examination, including: general appearance, skin, HEENT (head, ears, 
eyes, nose, and throat), neck, thorax/lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen, musculoskeletal, lymph nodes, neurologic (including mental status), and visual inspection of the lumbosacral and perianal region. Breast and genitourinary examinations are optional at the discretion of the investigator. Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses.
!A fecal impaction assessment will be performed. Fecal impaction is defined as a hard mass in the lower abdomen identified on physical examination or a dilated rectum filled with a large amount of stool on rectal examination. If a rectal examination is performed, the medically qualified site personnel should assess for and document the presence of anal wink and normal anal tone. If fecal impaction is identified, participants will receive a dis-impaction regimen with either oral or rectal medication. The choice of treatment will be determined by the investigator after discussing the options with the participant and the caregiver. Options will include any over-the-counter or prescription laxative, suppository, or enema (eg, polyethylene glycol, lactulose, Fleet enema). After the participant has received treatment for the impaction, the investigator must re-evaluate the participant for the presence of fecal impaction at Visit 2/Preintervention Visit. 
!Obtain height, vital signs (weight, temperature (oral, rectal, or tympanic), and respiratory rate), and postural vital signs (supine systolic and diastolic BP and pulse rate) (Section 8.2.2)

!Obtain vital signs (weight, temperature (oral, rectal, or tympanic), and respiratory rate) and postural vital signs (supine systolic and diastolic BP and pulse rate) (Section 8.2.2)
!Review any AEs occurring since the last visit
!Review concomitant medications
!Contact the IWRS, where applicable, for rescue medication to be dispensed to the participant.
!Remind caregiver to bring the bottle(s) of the rescue medication to the next visit.
!Instruct participants when to fast to ensure they have fasted for at least 2 hours before receiving the first dose of study intervention at the study site during the Randomization Visit; participants will be allowed to eat 30 minutes after dosing.
!Provide caregivers with the eDiary along with instructions 
10.8.3. Randomization (Visit 3, Day 1)
Participants' eligibility to enter the Study Intervention Period must be confirmed prior to 
randomization by review of inclusion and exclusion criteria, including a fecal impaction 
assessment, adherence to instructions regarding the use of rescue medication and prohibited medications, meeting eligibility criteria captured in the eDiary device, including full compliance 
with eDiary on at least 10 of the 14 days immediately preceding Visit 3 and with clinic eDiary on 
the day of Randomization. The study coordinator will obtain the eDiary eligibility report to determine eDiary-related eligibility to be randomized. Once the participant's randomization 
eligibility is confirmed based on the eDiary eligibility report and other inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, the IWRS will randomize the participant. Study personnel will review the study procedures with the caregivers and instruct them to continue completing the eDiary entries every 
evening. Subsequent study visits will be scheduled keeping in mind that the last dose of study 
intervention will occur at Visit 5 and should occur at approximately same time as the other doses of study intervention during double-blind Study Intervention Period.  
Randomization will occur on the first day of the Study Intervention Period. Based on 
randomization, participants will receive placebo or linaclotide. Participants will complete at least 4 weeks of treatment during the double-blind Study Intervention Period (ie, Study Intervention Period).
During the Randomization Visit (Visit 3), the following procedures will be performed:

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.010.9. Appendix 9: Liver Safety: Suggested Actions and Follow-up 
Assessments
Close monitoring should be initiated for the following participants:
!Participants with normal baseline serum aminotransferases (AT) who develop an increase 
of serum AT ≥3×U L N
!Participants with elevated baseline AT who develop an increase of serum AT > 2 × the baseline value 
The participant should return to the study site and be evaluated for potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI) as soon as possible, preferably within 48 to 72 hours from the time the investigator becomes aware of the abnormal results. Evaluation should typically include repeat testing of all 4 of the usual serum biochemical measures (ALT, AST, ALP, and TBL) to confirm the abnormalities and to determine if they are increasing or decreasing. 
If it is difficult for the participant to return to the study site promptly, the participant should be 
retested locally, but normal laboratory ranges should be recorded, results should be made available to sponsor’s study physician and the investigator immediately, and the data should be included in the eCRF. If repeat testing within this time frame is not possible, the study intervention should be discontinued.
It is critical to initiate close monitoring immediately upon detection and confirmation of signals 
of potential DILI as early as possible and not to wait until the next scheduled visit or monitoring interval. Close monitoring of the participant should be initiated in conjunction with the sponsor and consideration given to the following:
!Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases. 
!Obtain a history of concomitant drug use, including nonprescription medications, herbal products and dietary supplements, alcohol and recreational drug use, and special diets. 
!Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents. 
!Initiation of appropriate evaluations including applicable laboratory tests (eg, direct bilirubin, INR), physical assessments, and other assessments (eg, imaging)
o Rule out other potential causes of biochemical abnormalities, eg, acute viral hepatitis 
types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; NASH; hypoxic/ischemic 
hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease. 
!Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations.
If any of the following criteria are met, discontinuation of study intervention should be considered (if indicated, prior to receipt of confirming retest biochemistry laboratory test results) and the sponsor notified of the discontinuation:
!ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN and the participant is symptomatic with the appearance of 
fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia (> 5%)
!ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN and total bilirubin > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5 
!ALT or AST ≥ 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks
!ALT or AST ≥ 8 × ULN

GRD-CLN-T-01-01 v2.0If the study intervention is discontinued, the participant may be re-challenged with study 
intervention only after consultation with the Allergan MSP. All participants showing potential DILI should be followed until all abnormalities return to normal or to the baseline state.
Reporting of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
Potential Hy’s law cases are defined by biochemical test results of hepatocellular injury and 
impaired hepatic function. They are considered Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) and should be evaluated and followed further (ie, close monitoring initiated) to determine whether these laboratory abnormalities are indicative of DILI. As indicated above, discontinuation of study intervention should also be considered. Criteria that identify a potential Hy’s law case are as follows:
!ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN AND
!Total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN AND
!Alkaline phosphatase < 2 × ULN
Sites must report every participant who meets the Hy’s law criteria if this occurs within the time the participant signs the ICF until 30 days after the last dose of study intervention.
A laboratory alert for a potential DILI case will be sent immediately to the sponsor and 
investigators when the above criteria have been met, even if no clinical symptoms have been experienced. In addition, both an SAE and Adverse Event of Interest Abnormal Liver Function Reporting Form (GPSE-PVOPS-F-01-28) for all potential Hy’s law DILI cases should be completed as soon as possible (within 24 hours of learning that a participant fulfills the potential Hy’s law criteria) and submitted to the sponsor as noted in Appendix 3 . The eCRF pages 
associated with the potential Hy’s law cases must be completed within 7 calendar days.

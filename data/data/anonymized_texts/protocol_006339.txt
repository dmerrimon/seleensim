2. BACKGROUND 
 
2.1  Growth in Stem Cell Transplant: 
There has been tremendous progress in the past couple of deca des in allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) improving outcomes through incremental 
improvements. Further, access to SCT continue s to expand because of larger number of 
stem cell donor options to include HLA-matc hed unrelated donors (MUD), haploidentical 
related donors, and cord blood units (CBUs), significant impr ovements in supportive care, 
and introduction of better tolerated reduced in tensity conditioning (RIC) regimens (1-4).   
 
2.1.1 T-cell depletion 
T-cell depletion is another approach that enhances tolerability by reducing acute and 
chronic GVHD, complications which result in tremendous transplanted  related morbidity 
and mortality. We have employed in vivo  T-cell depletion with alemtuzumab for over 10 
years at the University of Chicago and conf irmed lower rates of acute and chronic GVHD 
and similar overall survival (5). Recent obser vational registry studies (6) and now even 
prospective studies have furthe r established that T-cell depl etion through either ATG or 
alemtuzumab enables better GVHD free survival (7 ).  Although relapse in general remains 
highly problematic after transplant (8), particul arly for those with active disease at SCT, T-
cell depletion further increases rates of relapse. The relapse rate for patients with AML undergoing RIC allo-SCT is in the range of ~25% at one year  without T cell depletion and 
in the range of 40-50% at 4 or  5 years with T cell depletion (4, 5, 9, 10).  There has been 
very little progress in reducing the incidenc e of relapse following allogeneic SCT.  
Therefore, the platform of T-cell depletion en ables patients to undergo transplant with low 
5 
 rates of GVHD but approaches to harness th e immune system later after transplant once 
conditioning toxicities have reso lved requires novel therapies. 
 
2.1.2 Treatment of high-risk hematologic malignances: 
Despite the high-rates of relapse if not increased treatment related mortality for patients 
entering transplant with poorly controlled hema tologic malignancies, some of these patients 
will achieve long-term disease c ontrol if not cure after allogeneic SCT. The prognosis for 
such patients absent a transplant remains di smal although better diseas e control (e.g., lack 
of peripheral blood blasts, longer remission duration), a sibling donor, younger recipient 
age and non-adverse cytogenetics  are favorable prognostic factor s. Strategies using allo-
SCT as a platform hold appeal to improve long-term outcomes. At the University of 
Chicago, we have developed an  interest in improving outcome s for high-risk hematologic 
malignances. One approach we and other have  tested with some success is further 
intensification using cyto-reductive chemothe rapy immediately before reduced intensity 
conditioning incorporating T-cell depletion with allogeneic SCT Because of the low rate of 
GVHD from T-cell depletion, patie nts tolerate these regimens  surprisingly well and even 
those entering transplant w ith active dise ase typically achieve remission (11). Although 
relapse appears to be delayed, most patients eventually develop disease recurrence. This 
protocol assesses maintenance on this established platform.  
2.2  Treatment Options for relapsed AML after SCT: 
A general tenant in hematologic malignancies and transplantation specifically is that 
prevention of relapse is more effective than  delaying further treatment until the time of 
relapse. Strategies that show  efficacy at relapse warrant te sting as prophylaxis. The current 
options of management for disease relapse af ter allo-SCT include withdrawal of immune 
suppression, chemotherapy, second allogeneic  transplant, cytokine and adoptive cell 
therapy and DLI.  Withdrawal of immunos uppression can be performed in all patients 
irrespective of hematopoietic stem cell sour ce. But the efficacy is very limited. While 
remission rates approaching 84% were observed in patients with chronic phase CML, they 
were only 10% for AML, and 0% for ALL and advanced phase CML (12) .  
 
2.2.1  Chemotherapy: For relapsed acute leukemia, both conventional chemotherapy 
and newer biological agents are able to i nduce significant remission rates, but long-term 
survival is very rare. The use of TKI, includi ng dasatinib and nilotini b in patients with Ph+ 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or 5-a zacytidine for relapsed AML may have 
particular benefit. Sorafenib and other FLT3 inhibitors, such as AC220 have demonstrated 
preliminary activity in a small number of  patients with relapsed FLT3+ AML (13). 
 In the AML setting, a retrospective analysis from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research 
Center (FHCRC) demonstrated that of those tr eated for relapse (which  is a fraction of the 
actual number of patients relapsing) around 30%  of relapsed AML after allo-SCT could 
enter CR after chemotherapy with cytarabine  (with and without adriamycin), but the 
median DFS was very short at 9.7 months ( 14) and the response was highly influenced by 
time to relapse after allo-SCT.  Specifically, 2- year survival estimates for patients relapsing 
less than 100 days, 100-200 days, and greater th an 200 days from allo-SCT were 3%, 9%, 
and 19%, respectively. Other studies explor ed the use of DLI after chemotherapy for 
relapse AML following allo-SCT, and found 1-y ear survival probability of 10% (95% 
6 
 confidence interval [CI] 3%-31%) if relapse o ccurred within 6 months of transplant versus 
44% (95% CI 29%- 68%) if relapse occurred la ter (15, 16). These data  led to the current 
practice standard to offer standard chemothe rapy, with and without DLI, only in patients 
who relapse more than 3 to 6 months after a llo-SCT, and refer other patients to clinical 
trials or palliative care if no trial available. Our own data showed similar results except almost all patients relapsing after T-cell deplet ion with alemtuzumab were able to receive 
treatment probably in part from low rates of  GVHD and high-tolerab ility of the regimen 
(17). Again, this provides further support for th e concept that T-cell depletion is a tolerable 
regimen and platform for subsequent therapy.  Given the relatively futile results of chemot herapy at relapse after allo-SCT, prophylactic 
chemotherapy after allo-SCT for high risk pa tients has been attempted, especially using 
less toxic hypomethylating agents. A phase 1 trial of azacitidine as post-transplant maintenance therapy conducted at the M.D. A nderson Cancer Center demonstrated that 
azacitidine could be given at 32 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks for at 
least 4 cycles with limited side effects in 42 patients who underwent reduced-intensity allo-
SCT for relapsed/refractory AML (18). Low-dose azacitidine was also used by the M.D. Anderson group to treat relapsed AML a nd MDS after allo-SCT, and around 20% long-
term disease control rate was found in patien ts with early relapses  (18). A German group 
also used low dose azacitidine followed w ith DLI in relapsed AML/MDS patients after 
Allo-SCT with low long-term response rate (19, 20).   
 
 
2.2.2  Second allogeneic transplant: Patients who have failed an initial Allo-SCT have 
chemo-refractory disease, making additional chemoradiotherapy unlikely to be curative. Historically, the role of second allogeneic  SCT has been limited by unacceptable relapse 
rates and high mortality rate, depending on previous therapies, age, and time from first 
transplantation. The efficacy of second allogene ic SCT depends on several factors, such as 
underlying malignancy, patient age and performa nce status, type of conditioning regimen 
employed, and time interval between first and second HSCT. In a large Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Re search (CIBMTR) retrospective study of 
patients with hematologic malignancies underg oing second allogeneic HSCT, transplant-
related mortality was 30% and the relapse rate was 42%, yielding an overall survival rate of 
28% at 5 years post-SCT (21).  Although often suggested, there is no demonstr ated benefit to using another donor when 
performing a second transplant after relapse. Generally, outcomes of second transplant are 
better for younger patients and for those w ith a longer time (6-12 months) from 
transplantation to relapse (i.e, remission du ration after SCT). Data from the CIBMTR 
showed a 5-year survival ra te of 51% in patients under ag e 20 years who relapsed more 
than 6 months after transplantation and only 3% in older patients who relapsed within 6 
months after transplantation (21). The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) reported the best out comes for patients with late relapse (292 
days) in remission at time of second transplant ation, with 53% survival  at 3 years (22).  
High-risk patients relapse earlier post-SCT wh ich also translates into lower chances of 
success with post-SCT therapy.   
7 
 2.2.3  Novel approaches with immune-therapies  
Innovative and novel immunotherapeutic approach es are currently un der investigation. 
Among other approaches, non-specific ex vivo  activation and expansion through co-
stimulation of donor T cells have been used sa fely, with intriguing GVT  responses (23). It 
also may be possible to gene rate leukemia-specific cytotoxi c T cells to use in adoptive 
immunotherapy (24). Another st rategy of generating CTLs ag ainst antigens presented on 
leukemic cells has been attempted by genetica lly modifying T cells to introduce antigen 
receptors capable of recogni zing leukemic cells. Cooper et al. generated T lymphocytes 
engineered to express chimeric antigen recep tors (CARs) specific for the CD19 molecule 
that may be able to prevent or treat leukemia relapse in B-ALL patients as these cells almost invariably express CD19 (25).  S uppression of negative immune-modulation by 
anti-CTLA4 antibodies, Ipilimum ab, has been explored (26) . Vaccine stra tegies with 
tumor-specific antigens or modified tumor cells  are other promising approaches to generate 
tumor specific immunity (27, 28). These strategi es will likely be most effective in the 
setting of minimal residual disease.  
 
2.3  DLI for relapse after SCT   
Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) has been proven to induce remissions post-transplant in 
patients with relapsed hematologic malignancie s most consistently observed in patients 
with CML, and to a lesser extent in AML, multiple myeloma and myelodysplasia (29).  
 
2.3.1  General principles of DLI: source, effective cell dose, timing and toxicity:  
Although G-CSF-stimulated peripheral blood ce lls for DLI have been used (16),  
typically donor lymphocyte is obtained by leukapheresis of un-stimulated peripheral blood 
(a.k.a., steady-state lymphocytes) which will cont ain other cell types in  addition to CD3+ 
cells, such as dendritic cells, B cells, monoc ytic cells and natural killer (NK) cells, 
providing a spectrum of allo-reactive and other accessory cells that might play a role in 
graft-versus-tumor effect (30).  The optimal CD3 cell dose in DLI is not es tablished. However, some studies have 
demonstrated that in patients with CML, a dose of 1x10
7/kg can induce complete donor 
chimerism and a potent graft versus-leukemia ( GVL) effect, in some cases in the absence 
of clinical GVHD particularly if given at later time points following transplantation (31). 
On the other hand, Fozza et al demonstrated  that the incidence of GVHD was not 
significantly different in patien ts receiving less than 1 × 107 CD3+/kg compared with the 
patients who received doses greater than 1 × 107 CD3+/kg (32).  
 The timing of DLI and the interval after DLI required to observe a response from the DLI 
are important factors influenci ng the effectiveness of this st rategy. Patients with relapses 
occurring more than 6 months post-transpla ntation have higher chances of responding to 
DLI (33). In support of the aforementioned data, Choi et al. found 55% overall survival at 1 
year in patients who were treated for relaps e, which occurred greater than 6 months post-
transplantation, as opposed to 0%  survival at 1 year in patie nts treated for relapse that 
occurred within 6 months following SCT (16). Disease response following DLI can be seen 
between 40 days and up to 1 year following DLI.  Another predictor of DLI success is the 
tumor burden at the time DLI is administered. Patients with evidence of molecular relapse 
at the time of DLI have better responses ev en in malignancies not typically viewed as 
8 
 responsive to DLI, such as ALL, which mi ght support careful screening of patients for 
detection of molecular relapse (33) offe r further support for pr ophylactic approaches 
 The major complications with DLI are the development of GVHD a nd cytopenias; marrow 
aplasia has also been appreciated but is qui te rare. Acute GVHD develops in up to 40–60% 
of patients who receive DLI. The developmen t of GVHD does not always correlate with 
GVT activity (34). The time interval between SCT and DLI therapy appears to influence the likelihood of developing GVHD. A small dose of 1 x 10
5 T cells/kg can induce GVHD 
if administered on the day of tran splant (35), yet a dose of 1 x 107 T cells/kg can be given 
at 12 months post-transplant without GVHD de velopment (31). Other factors which make 
GVHD more likely to occur include donor sex mi smatch (female donor to male recipient), 
advanced patient age and mismat ch at the mHag level (36).  
 Aplasia is now a relatively infrequent complication of DLI. It is often tr ansient, but in some 
cases may require hematopoietic stem cell rescue . It was reported historically in 15-20% of 
treated CML patients with an associated mortality rate of ~ 5%. Aplasia is more common in hematological relapse of CML, possibly due to poor donor myeloid reserve, and is rarely 
reported in patients with exclusively cytogeneti c or molecular relapse (37, 38) or in those 
treated for low levels of recipient mixed chimerism.  Overall, DLI is an effective form of i mmunotherapy in patients with CML who relapse 
following SCT, with remission rates of approximately 80%. The results in patients with acute leukemias and myelodysplasia are disapp ointing with remission rates in 15–25% of 
patients and often the re sponses are not durable. 
 
2.3.2  Strategies to avoid DLI-associated toxicity and improve outcome of DLI 
 
2.3.2.1 Escalated dose regimen (EDR):  Administration of DLI as  a single bolus of cells 
collected from a single leukapheresis containi ng variable numbers of CD3+ T cells is 
referred to as a bulk dose regimen (BDR) and this approach is associated with a high 
incidence of GVHD (37-39). The EDR approach is  fundamentally different in that the DLI 
product is quantitated for CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+  T-cell numbers and is then administered 
in multiple small aliquots with a dose escalation over time. In this way, the minimum cell dose needed to achieve disease remission is administered and with more modest cell doses, the likelihood of GVHD may be reduced (3 1). One study in CML comparing BDR and 
EDR approaches demonstrated equivalent remission rates with both schedules, but a 
significantly lower incidence of GVHD in the ED R cohort (38). It is critical when using the 
EDR schedule to allow an adequate interval between DLI doses to allow for assessment of 
response and toxicity. The optimum interval be tween doses is yet to be defined, but Dazzi 
et al. report that shorter intervals (rather than total cell dose) leads to  a higher incidence of 
GVHD (38).   
2.3.2.2   Manipulation of DLI products: 
In order to decrease the incidence of GVHD,  many methods have been attempted including 
depletion of allo-reactive T cells by co-inc ubation of donor lymphocytes with allogenic 
recipient stimulator cells followed by target ing with immunotoxin-conjugated antibodies 
specific for cell-surface activation markers or  antibodies (40, 41). CD 8+ T cells are thought 
9 
 to be the primary mediators of GVHD in hum ans while CD4+ T cells are reported to 
contribute more to the GVT effect (42). For th is reason, a number of groups have explored 
CD8+ T-cell depletion as a strategy to re duce the incidence of GVHD.  CD8+ T-cell 
depletion of the stem cell graft has been re ported to reduce the ri sk of GVHD without a 
parallel increase in relapse rate s in several studies (43-45).  
 Other manipulations under study include engi neered tumor-reactive T cells expressing 
either HLA-restricted, heterodimeric TCRs or  chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that 
recognize native cell-surface antigens. Seco nd generation CARs often comprise an 
antibody binding motif and a CD28--CD3 dual si gnaling receptor which facilitates T-cell 
activation and expansion following s timulation (reviewed in (46)). 
 On the other hand, Porter et al. demonstrated that infusion of ‘ex vivo’  activated donor 
lymphocytes (using anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 coated beads) in patients with a range of hematologic malignancies led to respons es where conventional DLI had been 
disappointing.  A total of  17 patients were evaluated and 8 achieved CR. The incidence of 
GVHD in this cohort compared favorably with that of conve ntional DLI (23).  
 
2.3.2.3  DLI preceded by chemotherapy especially in acute leukemia.  
 
Use of chemotherapy appears to  improve the results of DLI. Response rates vary from 10% 
to 60%, with higher response rates than those reported for DLI alone (15, 47). The 
European Group for Blood and Marrow Transp lant (EBMT) reporte d a retrospective 
analysis of 399 patients with AML in first he matologic relapse after transplant and found in 
the DLI subgroup, having less blasts in the BM (<35%), female sex, presence of favorable 
cytogenetics, and CR at the time of DLI were covariates associated with improved survival 
(47). The benefit of chemotherapy prior to DL I is suggested here by the 2-year survival 
>50% for patients that received DLI in CR.  Patients with recurrent AML after allogeneic transplantation have been treated with chemotherapy prior to DLI. Chemotherapy was administered because of rapidly 
progressive disease or in an atte mpt to debulk patients prior to DLI.  Levine et al conducted 
a prospective trial of chemotherapy and G- CSF-stimulated DLI. Patients who emerged 
from the chemotherapy and DLI in complete remi ssion had a 2-year overa ll survival rate of 
41% (15).  Studies from Japa n and Korea treated patients with relapsed acute leukemia 
using chemotherapy followed by DLI reported an overall comp lete response ra te of 33% , 
and 31% estimated overall survival at  24 months respectively (16, 48).   
 While these results engender some enthusiasm for such a strategy, a number of questions 
remain unanswered. The optimal timing of adoptive immunotherapy, whether administered during the nadir or after hema topoietic recovery, is unknown. The contribution of the cell 
therapy to the response rates from chemothera py alone cannot be determined in the absence 
of a prospective randomized trial.  Our ow n study in 25 patients with relapsed AML or 
high-risk MDS after transplant did not dem onstrate advantage over chemotherapy alone for 
patients who received cellular therapy (second  transplant or DLI) after chemotherapy, 
although the sample size was small (17). Our da ta was consistent with the data from a 
pediatric study on 49 pediatric patients receiving DLI for relapse following transplantation; 
10 
 there was no advantage of DLI after adjustment for clinical variables compared with a large 
cohort of children with relapsed AML who did not receive DLI after transplant (49).  
 
2.4 Prophylaxis DLI after SCT 
Because DLI seems to be most effective for patients with minimal residual disease, the role 
of prophylactic DLI (pDLI) for high risk patie nts after stem cell transplant has been 
explored, especially in the setting of T –cell depleted SCT with increased relapse rates. Several studies have examined the utility of pDLI to minimize tumor recurrence in 
myeloablative (50-55) and in  the RIC setting (56-61).   
 
2.4.1  Prophylactic DLI in myeloablative T cell depleted SCT 
In the myeloablative setting, the largest seri es was reported by Montero et al (55).  One 
hundred thirty-eight patients with hematologic malignancies received myeloablative T cell-
depleted peripheral blood stem cell transp lant from an HLA-identical sibling donor. 112 
patients with acute graft-versus-host diseas e (GVHD) grade <2 received 1 or 2 donor 
lymphocyte infusions of 10-50x 10
6 CD3+ cells/kg between days 45 and 100. Overall 
survival (OS), relapse-free survival, relapse,  and transplant-related mortality (TRM) were 
58%, 46%, 40%, and 20%, respectively, after a median follow-up of 4 years. Fifty-three 
(39%) and 21 (15%) patients developed grade 2-4 and 3-4 acute GVHD respectively. 
Forty-two (36%) had limited and 29 (25%) ha d extensive chronic GVHD. In multivariate 
analysis, disease risk was an independent f actor for OS and relapse, day-30 lymphocyte 
count for OS and TRM, and chronic GVHD for OS and relapse. PBSCT with early T cell 
add back leads to comparable rates of chronic GVHD compared with T cell-replete 
PBSCT. However, this chronic GVHD after T cell add back was associated with less 
mortality and retains a protective effect in terms of relapse, at least in the standard-risk 
patients (55).  
 
The patients reported by Sch aap received planned DLI at a median of 22 weeks (range: 12–
40) post-SCT, provided the post-SCT immunosuppr ession was disconti nued for at least 2 
months without evidence of active chronic GVHD and no history of acute GVHD above 
grade 1 (53). Similarly, Nakamura reporte d on patients who had planned non-mobilized 
cryopreserved DLI of 10x106 CD3/kg at day +45 and a second infusion of 50x106 CD3/kg 
at day +100 (52). Alternatively, Lee et al. (5 4) and Ferra et al. ( 51) selected DLI dosing 
based on the risk of GVHD and/or relapse risk.  
 In summary, the risk of relapse ranged fr om 18 to 69% with TRM occurring in 6–52%. 
This translated into a DFS that exceeded 40% at 2 years (50-55). Schaap’s study (53) compared outcomes of patients receiving DLI with those patients not receiving DLI, relapse rates were lower resulting in improved LFS. Furthermore, the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD and the risk of TRM do not seem to differ from expected outcomes 
after conventional transp lants without DLI.  
 
2.4.2  Prophylactic DLI in non-myeloablative or RIC T cell depleted SCT 
Several studies have analyzed outcomes of pDLI after RIC (56-61) . Barge et al. (56) 
reported on 11 patients, who were given pla nned DLI at 6 months after RIC MRD SCT 
with in vitro  TCD.  The DLI dose, given as unsel ected mononuclear cells, was based on 
disease status. Patients with relapse or  progression at 6 months received 10–100x10
6 
11 
 MNC/kg plus IFN-a compared with only 10x106 MNC/kg for patients with stable disease 
or mixed chimerism. For the 11 patients r eceiving DLI, 5 responded (CR=3; PR=2) and 1 
patient had stable disease. Acute GVHD developed in six patie nts, chronic GVHD in four 
patients and GVHD accounted for th e death of one patient.  
 In the report from de Lima et al. (57), 12 pa tients with anticipated li fe expectancy of less 
than 6 months received fludarabine–melphala n conditioning and sibling PBSC allogeneic 
SCT for active hematologic malignancies, including AML (n=4), myelodysplasia (MDS, 
n=1), ALL (n=3), CML (n=3) an d MM (n=1). All patients we re scheduled to receive non-
mobilized DLI at days +30, +60 and +90. Six pa tients received DLI. Of these, four patients 
achieved a CR, only one of whom was in CR at 14 months after SCT. The other three 
patients had either died due to  TRM or due to relapse.  
 Schmid et al (59) studied 75 patients w ith high-risk AML or MDS who received non-
myeloablative conditioning with fludarabi ne, cytarabine and low-dose total body 
irradiation. Patients were schedul ed to receive prophylactic DLI after 120 days if there was 
no evidence of GVHD and they were of f immunosuppression medications. Of the 75 
patients enrolled, only 12 patients were able to receive prophylactic DLI due to early 
relapse, GVHD and other transplant-related comp lications, demonstratin g the challenges of 
this approach. Another study used prophylactic CD8-depleted DLI after reduced-intensity 
transplant (60). In that study, 11 of 23 patients were able to receive DLI. Patients receiving 
CD8-depleted DLI demonstrated accelerate d immune reconstitution and minimal GVHD.  
 Mixed chimerism is common after reduced-intens ity regimens and may be associated with 
higher risks of relapse following transplantation. DLI has been used successfully in some 
patients with acute leukemia in order to fac ilitate conversion to full donor chimerism after 
reduced-intensity transplantation, and seems to lower relapse risk, albeit with a significant 
risk of acute GVHD (58, 61).   
2.4.3  Summary of Feasibility of prophylactic DLI in T-cell depleted SCT. 
In the Schmid study after a non-T-cell deplet ed regimen, only 12 of 75 (16%) received a 
DLI post-transplant around day 120 because of  high rates of aGVHD before planned DLI 
(59). De Lima showed that 6/12 (50%) could receive pDLI planned at days +30, +60 and 
+90 (57).    Minimizing aGVHD after T-cell depletion appear s to increase the feas ibility of giving 
pDLI. In the setting of TCD myeloablative SCT, Montero et al (55) de monstrated that 112 
out of 138 patients (81%) were able to re ceive prophylactic DLI between days 45 and 100. 
Several other reports of T-cell depleted regimens demonstrated  that 38% to 61% of patients 
received scheduled pDLI (51,53-54,56,60). No st udies have evaluate d high-risk patients 
alone or followed our unique backbone of cyto-reduction prior to transplant conditioning 
incorporating T- cell depletion.  
 
2.4.4  Rationale for repetitive DLI. 
A recent study demonstrated that patients w ith acute myelogenous leukemia or chronic 
myelogenous leukemia in remission following SCT exhibited significant numbers of peripheral blood CD8+ T cells that recognized varying combinations of epitopes derived 
12 
 from leukemia-associated antigens. However, these cells failed to proliferate, release 
cytokines, or de-granulate in response to antigen-specific st imuli.  The use of IL-15 or 
high-dose IL-2, elimination of CD 4+ regulatory T cells, and bloc kade of PD-L all failed to 
rescue responsiveness of these CD8+ T cells in  in vitro  assays. Rather, the mechanism for 
CD8+ unresponsiveness after SCT seemed to be replicative senescence (62).  
 There are multiple sources of chronic stimulation following SCT that may contribute to potential T-cell senescence, including GVHD,  GVL activity, infection, persistent 
stimulation of T cells by residual leukemia cells , and slow reconstitution of CD4+ T cells 
after SCT during the homeostatic  proliferation to repopulate th e T-cell pool. On the other 
hand, population dynamics of the T-cell pool afte r transplant may be influenced by the 
intensity of the conditioning regimen before transplant, T-cell dose within the graft, immunosuppressive therapy, and the use of donor lymphocyte infusions (62). 
 If donor T cells become tolera nt or possibly rapidly senesc ent after SCT as a mechanism 
leading to relapse, in order to preserve a nd maintain a competent pool of CD8+ T-cell 
precursors after allogeneic HSCT, the use of repetitive DLI once a patient achieves 
remission may be useful.   
2.5  Rationale to conduct prophylactic dose-escalation DLI to prevent relapse in 
hematologic malignancies after T cell depleted allo-SCT.  
Since relapse becomes a major issue in non-my eloablative T cell depleted allo-SCT, and 
DLI is a clinically available and established treatment that is most effective for minimal residual disease, the role of prophylactic DLI for patients in remission to prevent relapse 
will be assessed in a single arm Phase II study. The study will focus on patients with high 
risk hematologic malignancies that roughly co rrelate to having leukemia not in remission, 
lymphoma not achieving a par tial response, or other diseas e under poor control undergoing 
allo-SCT. We reviewed the University of Chicago transplant database for patients with high-risk AML or MDS who underwent a T-cell de pleted (TCD) allogeneic transplant. Of 
the 145 patients with AML or MDS transplanted with active disease,  relapse occurred at 
the median of 128 days (24 to 2364 days), w ith PFS of 137 days (4 to 3272 days) and OS 
of 214 days (4-3434 days) in the fl udarabine/melphalan/Alentuzumab and 
clofarabine/melphalan/Alentuzumab conditioni ng regimens (unpublished data). From our 
published data, using fludarabine/melphalan/Alentuzumab conditioning regimen, patients with high-risk disease had a 39% probability of disease recurrence, a 39% probability of treatment-related mortality, and a 25% probabil ity of progression-free survival at 1 year 
after stem cell transplant (63).  In our clof arabine/melphalan/Alentuzumab protocol (11), 
35 out of the total 72 patients accrued had high risk, active disease, and had 1 year PFS of 
31% which is similar to the 25% 1 year PFS using fludarabine/melphalan/Alentuzumab, 
and 1 year relapse rate of 29%  for the whole cohort, making th e 1 year relapse rate for the 
high risk patients comparable to 1 year relapse rate of 39% from 
fludarabine/melphalan/Alentuzumab. The cumu lative probability of Grade II-IV acute 
GVHD was 33% in flu/mel/campath and 22% in clo/mel/campath study at 1 years, and 1 
year TRM was 33% and 26% respectively (1 1, 63). Published data using fludarabine+ 
bulsufan+ alentuzumab or ATG had compar able results in high risk hematologic 
malignancies (64, 65).   
13 
 We have opted against a randomized trial for several reasons. This nove l approach requires 
feasibility testing of the entire process including enrolling high -risk patients, early 
withdrawal of immune suppression and the ability to escalate DLIs.

5. TREATMENT PLAN 
 
5.1. Study Design  
 
A. This is an open-label, single arm Phase II study aiming to reduce relapse in extremely 
high risk hematologic malignancies after matc hed donor stem cell transplant with T cell 
depleted conditioning regimen by early wit hdrawal of immune suppression followed by 
prophylactic DLI.  Eligible patients will be consented for this study at the time they are 
consented for the allogeneic stem cell transplant.  
B. The matched related and unrelated donors will be evaluated and cleared in the routine 
standard fashion and are consented to collection per standard care.  
  Matched related donors (MRD):  Matched donors will be eval uated and collected as per 
routine standard procedures. The donor will not be consented to this protocol because there is no research procedure performed on donors, and collection of steady state 
lymphocytes before and/or after transplantation is routine.  Clinical consent for collection 
is required. We will request donors to give st eady-state donor lymphocytes prior to stem 
cell collection. This involves a short-apheresis procedure us ually collecting 10 -12 liters 
of blood. After that, mobilizati on in standard fashion is st arted with G-CSF (Neupogen) 
for 4 days with stem cell collection by leuka pheresis on day 5 and/or  6 of a large volume 
(e.g., 16-24 liters depending on donor weight). A lternatives to pre-mobilization collection 
include steady-state collection of the donor la ter closer to the planned DLI infusion or 
using a fraction of the mobilized stem cell product for DLI.  The composition of the DLI differs when obtained from a G-CSF mobili zed product, although it is not clear if 
outcomes differ. Therefore, steady-state (i.e , non-mobilized) lymphocytes are preferred 
but not mandatory. The steady state donor lymphocytes from  the matched donor will be 
collected and cryo-preserved as needed at our Stem cell lab. They will be enumerated by CD3 count and stored in appr opriate aliquots. Typically, on e steady state collection will 
provide an adequate number of CD3 lymphocytes for all the planned DLIs. 
 
Matched unrelated donors (MUD):  Steady state collection will likely require approval 
of the National Marrow Donor Program (N MDP), the organizati on that oversees 
collection of unrelated donor products.  U ltimately, the decision on when to obtain 
lymphocytes will be determined by the NM DP, the donor, and the donor center. We will 
request, steady-state lymphocytes from matc hed unrelated donor to be collected and 
shipped to the University of Chicago before  the first scheduled DLI infusion and the DLI 
will be cryo-preserved as above. As for the related donors, alternative options are using a 
16 
 portion of the mobilized stem cell product for DLI or steady-state collection of 
lymphocytes later after transplant. These me thods do not require approval in advance. 
However, logistical issues may present a barr ier to using the mobili zed stem cells for DLI 
as this requires that the MUD product has an adequate stem cell dose by CD34 cells/kg 
and enough time to obtain the results to cryo -preserve a portion of the product. This 
protocol will be submitted to the NMDP fo r approval for the collection of lymphocytes 
from matched unrelated donors. 
 
C. Treatment :  
 Immune suppression withdrawal : Rapid taper of immune suppression will begin from 
day 60 to 75. It is recommended to reduce th e dose 25-50% every 5 days over 10-20 days, 
then discontinue.  
Prior to each DLI: 
1. Determine peripheral blood chimerism 
2. Complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel 
3. Assess for acute and chronic GVHD. We exp ect delays especial ly for people with 
emerging or resolving GVHD to undergo further evaluation. 
4. Three month disease restaging will be done prior to first DLI.  Should the results be 
unavailable, DLI may be given as planned. 
 
DLI after Matched Related Donor (MRD) by recipient weight:   
 
Number Dose (CD3/kg) 
1-MRD 2 x 105 
2-MRD 5 x 105 
3-MRD 1 x 106 
4-MRD 2 x 106 
5-MRD 5 x 106 
 
 
DLI after Matched Unrelated Donor (MUD) by recipient weight:   
Number Dose (CD3/kg) 
1-MUD 1x 105 
2-MUD 2 x 105 
3-MUD 5 x 105 
4-MUD 1 x 106 
5-MUD 2 x 106 
 
Patients will get dose escalation DLI at 4 - 8 weeks intervals if there is no grade II-IV 
aGVHD, no chronic GVHD and patient is not receiving system immune suppression. 
Topical GVHD therapy is acceptable, including t opical GI therapy (e.g., budesonide) with 
a goal of every 4 weeks. The goal is infuse as  close to every 4 weeks as possible. The DLI 
will be conducted in routine fashion. This is typically an outpatient procedure but can be 
done as an inpatient if needed.

After DLI:   
1. Clinic visit the day of or with in 3 days of planned DLI to assess as above (prior to each 
DLI).  
2. CBC and comprehensive metabolic panel ar e recommended every 2 weeks after DLI 
for at least 6 weeks after the last DLI infusion  
3. Long-term follow-up of disease will follo w standard clinical practice. Our 
recommended approach has been to repeat disease staging (bone marrow for leukemias 
and imaging for lymphomas) around day 100, day 180, 1 year and as indicated after 
stem cell infusion).   
 
D. Number of Patients : 80 
 
E. Accrual : Target accrual will be 1-2 patients ev ery 4 weeks (12-24 patients/year).   
 
5.2. Duration of Therapy 
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adve rse event(s), treatment may continue for five 
dose-escalating doses in 5-10 months or until  one of the following criteria applies: 
 Disease relapse 
 Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment 
 Grade III-IV acute GVHD 
 Grade II acute GVHD lasting more than 8 w eeks after last DLI tr eatment or chronic 
GVHD. Patients could be continued on the study if GVHD resolves within 8 weeks 
from the last DLI infusion off steroid unless only for adrenal insufficiency.  
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or 
18 
  General or specific changes in the patient ’s condition render the patient unacceptable 
for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. 
 
5.3. Duration of Follow Up 
 
The patients will be followed according to the current post stem cell transplant guidelines.  
For this study, the enrolled patients will be  followed for 2 years after stem cell infusion, 
removal from study or until death, whichever occurs first.  Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse 
event.  
5.4. Criteria for Removal from Study 
 
Patients will be removed from study when any of  the criteria listed in  Section 5.2 applies. 
Patients also may be removed from the study for patient non-compliance, the development 
of a severe medical condition un related to their hematologic malignancies or this treatment, 
or a decision from the investigator to di scontinue the study. The reason for study removal 
and the date the patient was removed will be  documented in the Case Report Form.  
 
5.5. Protocol Management Plan: 
 
For the primary analysis, an intention to treat  principle will apply such that all patients 
consenting will be analyzed. Secondary analysis will include only those patients for whom immune suppression withdrawal wa s started and DLI planned.  
 
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
 
The National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Scale (version 4.0) will be used to 
grade toxicities after each DLI infusion.  All Grade 3 and 4 toxicities, require delaying but not necessarily discontinuing treatment.  
If toxicity occurs, DLI dose can be delayed up to 4 weeks until side effect abates to within 
eligibility criteria. If a patient requires more than 4 weeks delay due to toxicities, then the 
patient will be removed from the study.    
Evaluation of acute GVHD (aGVHD) on the day of scheduled DLI infusion  
(4 weeks after last DLI) 
No aGVHD Proceed to scheduled next level dose of DLI  
Grade I aGVHD Proceed to scheduled next level dose of DLI 
Grade II aGVHD Delay DLI, re-evaluate after 4 week. 
 1. GVHD resolves off steroi d or systemic immune 
suppression; proceed to next level DLI. 2.  Still has Grade II aGVHD or higher; off study  
Grade III-IV aGVHD Off study 
Active Chronic GVHD Off study 
19 
 7. ADVERSE EVENTS MONITORI NG AND REPORTING:   
 
7.1. Toxicity Monitoring  
 
Patients will be monitored and questioned at every outpatient visit (see test schedule) 
regarding the occurrence and nature of any adve rse experiences. An event is defined as any 
change in the physiologic or psychological st ate other than the pr imary condition that 
qualifies the patient for the study. More freque nt monitoring will be performed in the case 
that an adverse event is noted.   Allogeneic transplant has substantial expect ed toxicities which are higher for patients 
entering transplant with active disease. Th e transplant approach prior to immune 
suppression withdrawal and DL I is standard of care and does not require formal 
comparison or stopping rules. The main toxicity  related to this approach is acute and 
chronic GVHD.  We will consider  terminating the study based on a high-rate of severe (i.e., 
grade III-IV) aGVHD. One must recognize aG VHD takes 4-8 weeks after each DLI to 
develop; one must have approximately 6 months  after starting immune withdrawal and DLI 
to determine if severe aGVHD will develop.  
7.2. Toxicity Reporting 
 
Toxicities are common followi ng transplant. Therefore, unexpected, grades 3-5 adverse 
events (AEs) will be reported to the UCC CC CCTO Quality Assurance (QA) Coordinator 
by the end of the business day when s/he beco mes aware of the event.  Events occurring 
after business hours will be re ported to the CCTO by 12pm ( noon) the next business day.  
Each event report must indicate where the event meets the IRB’s Unanticipated Problem 
reporting criteria. 
 The National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Scale (version 4.0) will be used to 
grade toxicities.   For this study, early withdraw al of immune suppression (a round day 60) and prophylactic 
donor lymphocyte infusions are experimental . The conditioning regimen and transplant 
itself is not experimental.  Adverse event monitoring should occur until 100 days past either of these procedures. Deaths will be repo rted for at least 200 days after transplant or 
100 days past any study proce dure, whichever is later. 
 
7.3. Definitions of Adverse Events (AEs ) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
 
Adverse Event - Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical produc t, medical treatment or procedure and 
which does not necessarily have to have a cau sal relationship with this treatment. An 
adverse event can therefore be any unfa vorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symp tom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a medicinal product, medical treatment or procedure whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product.   
 
20 
 Life-threatening Adverse Event – Any adverse event that places the patient or subject, 
in view of the investigat or, at immediate risk of death from the reaction.   
 
Unexpected Adverse Event – An adverse event is “unexpected” when its nature 
(specificity), severity, or frequency are not consistent with (a) the known or foreseeable 
risk of adverse events associated with the re search procedures desc ribed in the protocol-
related documents, such as the IRB-approve d research protocol, informed consent 
document and other relevant sources of information such as product labeling and 
package inserts; and are also not consistent with (b) the characteri stics of the subject 
population being studied includ ing the expected natural pr ogression of any underlying 
disease, disorder or condition any predisposing risk factor profile for the adverse event.  
 
Expected Adverse Event – Any adverse experience, even t, incident, interaction or 
outcome that is identified in nature, seve rity or frequency in the protocol-related 
documents, such as the IRB-approved resear ch protocol, informed consent document 
and other relevant sources of information su ch as product labeling and package inserts is 
considered an expected adverse event.  Any event that is previously known or 
anticipated to result from the underlying di sease, disorder, or condition of the human 
subject or the study population may also be considered an expected adverse event.  
 
Serious Adverse Events – An adverse event that resu lts in any of the following 
outcomes:  
 
• Death,  • Life-threatening adverse experience,  • *Inpatient hospitalization or prolongat ion of existing hospitalization,  
• Persistent or significan t disability/incapacity or, 
• Congenital anom aly/birth defect. 
• Is medically significant or requires me dical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
 
* The initial hospitalization for transplant pr ocedures or planned hospitalizations after 
transplant will not be considered an SAE unless the duration of the hospital stay is 
prolonged beyond what is expected  as part of routine care.  During the expected initial 
hospitalization, if toxicities that are not rout inely expected after tr ansplant are observed 
(examples listed in the table below), they  will be reported as an SAE. Transplant 
procedures are expected to result in ho spitalization for 10-20 da ys after stem cell 
infusion, depending on the stem cell source and pa tient health.  All ot her hospitalizations 
unless planned would qualify as an SAE per FDA definitions.   
 
Many toxicities that are grade 3 by CTC ar e expected and routine for transplant. 
Select Examples 
 
Expected Grade 3 -4 Toxicities for 
Transplant (NOT SAE) Not Routinely Expected Grade 3-4 for 
Transplant(SAE) 
Fever after engraftm ent without a source 
requiring several additional hospital days Intensive care unit admission

Velos as an AE.   No SAE report in  Velos or IRB is needed.     Report in 
Velos within 24 hours of being notified of event. 
22 
 Toxicity  
Continuous monitoring for severe and unexpected  adverse events will occur and regular 
time-points may be included per protocol. 
 
ALL Serious Adverse Events, whether or not they are considered related to the study 
agent MUST be reported to the sponsor-inve stigator and to the University of Chicago 
Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC).  Refer to Section 7.4.1 for reporting 
guidelines.  
 
7.4. Other Reporting Requirements 
 
7.4.1.  University of Chicago Compre hensive Cancer Center (UCCCC)  
  All serious adverse events (as defined in Sec tion 0) and protocol devi ations must also be 
reported to the UCCCC Cancer Clinical Tria ls Office (CCTO) in accordance with the 
UCCCC Data Safety Monitoring Plan.    The Research Nurse or other designated indivi dual should report the SAE/deviation to the 
UCCCC CCTO Quality Assurance (QA) Coordi nator by the end of the business day when 
s/he becomes aware of the event.  Events occu rring after business hours will be reported to 
the CCTO by 12pm (noon) the next business day.  Each event report must indicate where 
the event meets the IRB’s Unanticip ated Problem reporting criteria. 
 
7.4.2.  Institutional Review Board (IRB)
 
 Events meeting current IRB reporting criteria must be submitted by the principal 
investigator via the IRB’s electronic submission system
 within the IRB’s designated 
reporting timeframes .  Details of the IRB’s current reporting policy and timelines can be 
found on their website at: http://bsd irb.bsd.uchicago.edu/forms-guidelines/up.html . 
 The responsible research nurse  and/or clinical research associate/data manager are 
responsible for entering the appropriate information into the IRB’s electronic submission 
system and forwarding the submission to the prin cipal investigator for reporting to the IRB. 
 
7.5. Supportive Therapy 
 
Symptomatic care may be given as required with medications such as anti-emetics and 
analgesics.   GVHD should be clinically suspected when a pati ent develops skin rash, diarrhea, and liver 
abnormalities at any time point after DLI.  Di agnosis should be confirmed by skin biopsy, 
colonoscopy and biopsy of an involved area to confirm a pat hologic diagnosis and to rule 
out other potential cause s of the diarrhea; and potential liv er biopsy.  Should a diagnosis of 
GVHD be made or suspected, supportive care a nd non-systemic therapies are favored first. 
This includes topical steroid for localized skin GVHD, symptomatic anti-diarrheal agents, 
i. e., loperamide, for diarrhea. Patients wi th grade 2 to 4 will have standard GVHD 
treatment according to our protocol with high do se steroids, usually solumedrol at 2mg/kg.   
23 
 Liver GVHD should be suspected when a patient develops an elevation of transaminases 
with or without an elevation in the bilirubin level. A hepa tology consult and liver biopsy 
should be obtained to confirm a pat hologic diagnosis whenever possible. 
 
8. CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES 
 
In addition to routine clinical tests, we will collect additional samples for possible correlative studies.   For the serum Alentuzumab level testing, we will obtain 5-10ml  serum/plasma at day 60 at 
the time of immunosuppression withdrawal and at  around day 90 or on the day of  first DLI 
to evaluate serum Alemtuzumab levels acco rding to the published methods (66, 67). The 
samples will be 10 cc peripheral blood in Red-to p tube, and the serum will be stored in our 
stem cell core facility.  In addition to the standard immune recons titution studies includi ng lymphocyte subset 
panel 3 and quantitative immunoglobulin levels , an additional 10 cc heparinized (Green 
Top) peripheral blood will be will be collected  for detection of regulatory T cell panels and 
potentially other immune markers (e.g., T-cell repe rtoire) at the time of 
immunosuppression withdrawal, prior to first, the third, and the fifth DLI, and 1 year, 18 
months and 2 years after stem cell transplant.   For MRD detection in myeloid leukemia, CLL and lymphoma patients with bone marrow 
involvement, bone marrow aspiration study mate rial will be obtained from the bone 
marrow biopsy prior to stem cell transplant to be used as the baseline sample, since all the patients will have active disease before stem cell transplant. For lymphoma patients without 
bone marrow involvement, we will retrospec tively obtain lymph node biopsy samples at 
the diagnosis for baseline samples. The follow up MRD samples will be obtained from either bone marrow aspiration if available or peripheral blood at the time of 
immunosuppression withdrawal, prior to first, the third, and the fifth DLI, and 1 year, 18 
months and 2 years after stem cell transplant, or at the off study. The samples will be stored 
in our stem cell core facility.  
 We will store 10-20cc blood at the time of i mmunosuppression withdrawal, prior to first, 
the third, and the fifth DLI, and 1 year, 18 mont hs and 2 years after stem cell transplant for 
future potential studies.   The following tests are a list of correlative studies most likely to be performed should 
funding and samples permit.  A. Flow cytometry for Treg cells panels.  PBMC will be analyzed by flow cytometry 
using combinations of anti-CD4, and CD 25, and anti-FoxP3 or  CD127 monoclonal 
antibodies to identify the regulatory T ce ll subpopulation on perm eablized cells.  By 
combining the percent-positive cells with th e coulter counter data, an absolute number 
of CD4
+CD25+ FoxP3+ or CD4+CD25+CD127dim/- cells will be determined. We 
expect these will be done at our Human Immu nology Monitoring Facility at University 
of Chicago. 
24 
  
B. Measurement of Alemtuzumab level by ELISA.  There is no commercially available 
test for the Alemtuzumab level in se rum or plasma. A group in MD Anderson 
developed an easy ELISA test (66, 67). Affi nity-purified rabbit an ti-rat IgG absorbed 
with human IgG will be used to coat flat- button 96-well microtitre plates. After the 
plates are blocked using BSA (2%), patient  samples will be added in duplicate and 
incubated. Then, peroxidase-conjugated affinity-purified rabbit anti-human-Fc will be added followed by adding substrate to deve lop color reaction. After 4–8 minutes, the 
reaction will be stopped and plates will be re d at 450 nm, and a log reading of samples 
against control will be calculated. 
 
C. Minimal Residual Disease Monitoring: The presence of minimal residual disease in 
myeloid leukemia or MDS will be assessed by monitoring of WT1 transcript levels in 
blood or bone marrow using a quantitative RT-PCR assay. Briefly, total RNA will be extracted from blood and bone marrow a nd cDNA synthesized using standard 
techniques. Amplifications of patient samples, K562 cell line cDNA, and no template 
controls will be performed in triplicate. WT-1  expression levels will be detected using a 
transcript specific primer and probe set. In order to compensate for differences in RNA 
integrity and cDNA synthesis e fficiency, the absolute WT1 transcript copy number will 
be normalized to the endogenous control gene  Abl. For the lymphoid diseases, MRD of 
CLL will be detected using four color flow cytometry (68), and MRD in NHL will be detected using quantitation of IgH or  BCL-1/JH copy number using real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (69).  
D. Additional studies. There may be additional studies geared toward gaining a better 
understanding and predictors of disease re lapse, GVHD, and immunologic activity of 
this strategy. 
 
9. CRITERIA FOR STUDY EVALUATION 
 
The proportion of patients receiving one pDLI , proportion receiving al l pDLIs, PFS at 2 
year after stem cell transpla nt, highest Grade acute GVHD, relapse rate, and non-relapse 
mortality at 2 years after stem cell tran splant are the rele vant endpoints.   
 Acute GVHD will be scored according to the cr iteria proposed by Przepiorka et al (70). 
Limited Chronic GVHD is de fined as GVHD with limited skin involvement only or 
presenting with liver function abnormalities onl y. All other presentations of chronic GVHD 
are defined as extensive and will require trea tment. The diagnosis and staging of chronic 
GVHD will be done according to the published NIH Consensus (71).  
 Relapse will be recorded by the day of initia l detection of malignant  cells, if these cells 
were on subsequent testing confirmed to be increasing in number. The molecular detection 
of MRD will not be taken into account for the definition of clinical recurrence. The 
diagnosis of disease recurrence will be base d on clinical and pathological criteria.

11. DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS 
 
A. The University of Chicago medical records will be utilized for all pati ents.  Data will be 
entered into a data management file within 3 weeks after each evaluation of the patient.  After the patient goes off treatment, follow-up information will be collected and entered into the data management file ev ery 3 months by telephone contact.  
 
B. Pathologic diagnosis and HLA typing will be recorded in a conventional way with a 
record being placed in the patient’s permanent record and data management file.  However, investigational correlative assay results will not be made part of the medical record.   
27 
 C. Data and safety monitoring for this trial will be carried out in accordance with the 
University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plan.  Briefly, accrual, toxicity, and respons e data will be reviewed weekly at the 
transplant patient care conference. Adverse events will be repor ted to the principal 
investigator, IRB, as describe d in section 7.2.  Decisions w ill be made regarding study 
continuation, amendment, or closure at th e weekly meeting and a note will be signed by 
the principal investigator documenting this d ecision.  External monitoring of accrual is 
performed by the Accrual Monitoring Commi ttee.  The study will  be independently 
audited annually by the Cancer Clinical Trials Office of the University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center in  accordance with DSM Plan.  
 
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
12.1. Study Design 
Patients will be assigned to Matched relate d donor SCT group or Ma tched unrelated donor 
SCT group according to the type of donor  for their stem cell transplant.  
 
12.2. Sample Size/Accrual Rate 
  A total of 80 patients will be accrued with  an accrual rate at 10-15 patients per year. 
 
12.3. Statistical Considerations  
 
Statistical analysis: 
We expect that this protocol will enro ll approximately equal numbers of patients 
undergoing MRD or MUD SCT with more than 50% of patients from both groups 
combined will be able to receive at least one DLI treatment. We also intend to analyze the 2 year PFS, OS, and rate of aGVHD among th e patients who receive at least one DLI 
treatment. All the enrolled patients will be followed up at least 2 years from stem cell infusion as long as they are still alive. Base line characteristics will  be summarized using 
descriptive statistics.  Intention to treat analys is will be used to determine the percentage of 
patients who receive at least one DLI treatment.  Progression-free survival (time to relapse 
or death as a result
 of any cause) and overall survival will be computed using the Kaplan-
Meier product-limit estimate and expressed as probabilities with a 95% CI.  Acute and 
chronic GVHD, and treatment-rela ted mortality will be estima ted by cumulative incidence 
method. Cumulative incidence of treatment-related mortality with relapse of the original 
disease as the competing risk will be calculated.  
Sample size: 
We will determine the number of subjects w ho undergo withdrawal of immune suppression 
and receive at least one DLI.  For this estimate, subjects who consent but do not proceed to 
transplant will be considered non-evaluable. Based on prior studies outlined in the background with heterogeneous disease risk  and regimens, around 40-60% received pDLI 
after T-cell depleted regimens. We expect to  increase the proportion receiving at least one 
pDLI to around 70% with around  15% having progressive di sease after transplant and 
another 15% having GVHD or other clinical c oncerns that preclude  DLI (e.g., infection, 
unwillingness to proceed, or lack of availabl e lymphocytes). Thus we will test the null 
28 
 hypothesis of a 50% pDLI rate against a 70% a lternative.  To achie ve 85% power with a 
two sided test with alpha set at 0.05 requires n= minimum 56 patients.   
 
Should feasibility be established, this regimen w ill also need to demonstrate adequate disease 
activity to be pursued further.  We will collect preliminary da ta on  the efficacy of this 
treatment strategy for very high risk dise ase as measured by improved progression-free 
survival (PFS) compared  to historical data in  very similar patients (i.e, similar disease risk, 
similar regimens but no pDLI)  at our inst itution.  PFS was calculated for two major disease 
categories of AML and Non-H odgkin Lymphoma treated on Al emtuzumab-based protocols 
who entered transplant with high-risk disease (not in CR for AML and not in CR or PR for 
NHL) from our historical instit utional experience.   There ar e two populations in which one 
can calculate PFS. We can evaluate the entire cohort by intention to tr eat or an enriched 
cohort of only those who are eligible to be gin early immune suppr ession. We prefer the 
latter as this tests the efficacy (or biol ogic activity) of early immune suppression 
withdrawal and DLI for high-risk diseases. It is unlikely that there will be bias in our 
comparison as the major criteria for removal--significant aGVHD and disease relapse are unlikely to be affected by the investigators or  subjects. Alternative approaches are required 
to salvage patients with very early relapse or early significant GVHD.  
 We determined outcomes for AML patients without GVHD and relapse at 80 days post stem cell transplant as these are the patients w ho would be eligible for early withdrawal of 
immune suppression and DLI. The 2 year  PFS was 32.3% (95% CI 15.4% to 50.5%) for 
AML/MDS patients and 37.9% (9 5% CI 10.8% -65.4 %) for NHL patients. These are 
better than the outcomes of the entire cohort because of censoring as  above. Outcomes for 
higher risk hematologic malignancie s tend to be similar to each other (as expected as that is 
the inherent purpose of “high-risk” classifi cation) thus justifyi ng combining NHL, AML 
and other high risk diseases. Otherwise too few patients exist to generate a reliable 
historical control rate. Collapsing AML and NHL into one category, we have a null, two-
year PFS rate of 35% based on our historical controls.  
 
Stopping rules: 
We will monitor aGVHD regularly and have deri ved a formal stopping rule. After every 10 
patients have passed 6 months of follow up from immune suppression withdrawal, the 
incidence of aGVHD will be calculated.  Pa tients who relapse or develop significant 
aGVHD before tapering will not be counted. Overal l rates in historical controls after T-cell 
depleted regimens with alemtuzumab of aGVHD  have been very low, at around 15%, with 
even fewer cases of severe aGVHD.   As the re gimen tested in this trial may reduce relapse 
at the expense of higher risks of aGVHD, we will allow a somewhat higher rate to occur. 
Specifically, if the lower limit of the 95% c onfidence interval exce eds 25% for severe 
(grade III-IV) GVHD, the study will halt accrual.  Either protocol modification will occur or 
the study will be terminated. These modifications may include reduced DLI dose or number of infusions, delay of stopping immune  suppression, or possi bly continued immune 
suppression even after DLI.   Numbers of severe aGVHD events for every 10 subjects that warrant protocol stopping or 
revision are:  
29 
 Severe 
aGVHD events Enrolled 
Subjects  
Observed aGVHD 
(%) 95% CI 
6 10 60% 30.3-78.3 9 20 45% 26.0-65.3 
13 30 43% 27.9-58.9 16 40 40% 26.9-54.22 19 50 38% 26.5-50.6 
However, high rates of aGVHD that do not  meet the stopping rules may still warrant 
protocol modification at the di scretion of the investigators. 
 The pre-defined stopping rule was never met dur ing the enrollment of th e first 56 subjects 
defined by the original protoc ol. Thus, severe GVHD has been  demonstrated to not be a 
concern for this study. The amended protocol w ill allow us to enroll more patients to the 
study for better efficacy evaluation. We exp ect to close the study after the requested 
number of 80 subjects has been reached.  While it is acceptable to have significant and severe aGVHD for curative intent 
approaches, the major problem with high rates of severe aGVHD is that this would make 
this a poor platform to integrate additional th erapies later as severe aGVHD often prevents 
further immune modulation.  Chronic GVHD also remains of interest bu t can occur years after aGVHD and thus 
stopping rules based on this outcome cannot be formulated. We will further monitor the proportion undergoing early imm une withdrawal with or without DLI continuously.  
 
13.  FUTURE DIRECTIONS 
Depending on the results of this  study, we will modify or de sign the future studies. The 
first possible modification may be to include leukemia patients with hi gh-risk cytogenetics 
that are under disease control (remission) as  outcomes are similar to those with active 
disease. We have excluded these patients initially as historically cytoreduction is not typically given prior to transplant since they do not have morphologic disease. If high early 
aGVHD is observed, we will continue immune suppression with DLI, since some data 
indicate DLI maintains a benefit even if infu sed with immune suppression. If high rate of 
acute GVHD occurs with escalated DLI doses, we will not escalate DLI or we will stop 
DLI after full donor chimerism for patients starti ng with mixed chimerism. If high rates of 
chronic GVHD are found, we will continue  immune suppression during DLI or give 
cyclophosphamide after DLI. If there is no chan ge in relapse rates after prophylactic DLI, 
we will either further escalate DLI doses or add disease specific agents or immune stimulation, such as basiliximab, or ipiluzumab.

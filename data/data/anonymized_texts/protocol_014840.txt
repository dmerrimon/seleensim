10 • CA-125 response determined using the GCIG  criteria defined in Appendix  C 
• Progression- free survival ( PFS), defined as the time from first dose of MIRV until 
Investigator- assessed radiological PD or death, whichever occurs first  
• Overall survival ( OS), defined as the time from first dose of MIRV until death   
Study Design Overview:  
This Phase 3 study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MIRV in patients with platinum-
resistant high -grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, 
whose tumors express a high -level of FRα, referred to throughout as PROC (platinum- resistant ovarian 
cancer) . Patients will be, in the opinion of the Investigator, appropriate for single-agent therapy for 
their next line of therapy . FRα positivity will be defined by the Ventana FOLRI Assay . 
Approximately 110 eligible  patients will be enrolled to achieve a total of 105 efficacy evaluable 
patients. Efficacy evaluable patients include those who have measurable lesions (per RECIST v1.1) at 
baseline and received at least 1 dose of MIRV .   
All patients will receive single -agent MIRV at 6  mg/kg adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW) 
administered on Day 1 of every 3- week cycle (Q3W).  
Tumor response will be evaluated by the Investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST  v1.1). Computeriz ed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) scans will be collected for sensitivity analysis by blinded independent central review (BICR).  
Patients will continue to receive MIRV until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of 
consent, death, or until the Sponsor terminates the study (whichever comes first).  
Tumor assessments, including radiological assessments by CT/MRI scans will be performed at 
Screening and subsequently every 6 weeks ( ± 1 week ) from Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) for the first 
36 weeks then every 12 weeks ( ± 3 weeks) until disease progression, death, the start of new anticancer 
therapy, or patient’s withdrawal of consent  (whichever occurs first).  
Patients who discontinue MIRV  for reasons other than progressive disease (PD) will continue with 
tumor assessments until documentation of PD or the start of a new anticancer therapy, whichever comes first. Prior to Week 36 (from Cycle 1, Day 1), assessments should occur every 6 weeks 
(± 1 week) as allowed by local requirements but must occur at an interval of no more than 12 weeks. 
After Week 36, assessment will occur every 12 weeks (± 3 weeks) until documentation of PD or the 
start of new anticancer therapy.
  
All patients who disconti nue MIRV  will be followed for survival every 3 months ( ± 1 month ) until 
death, lost to follow -up, withdrawal of consent for survival follow-up, or end of study (EOS) 
(whichever comes first). Additional survival follow- up calls may occur periodically, if ne eded.

16 Note: A patient’s  BRCA  mutational status (germline or  somatic mutation in tumor tissue) will be collected as part of her medical history if available. Patients 
without a known mutation will be classified as unknown.  
a Must be within 28 days before C1D1 unless otherwise specified.  
b ECG assessment may be performed predose at C1D1 if not performed previously up to 28 days prior to first dose of MIRV.  
c Must be within 14 days before C1D1.  
d Testing for FRα expression is required for all patients. Those who do not have archival tumor tissue to submit will be requir ed to undergo procedures to obtain 
a new biopsy using a low -risk, medically routine procedure during the Pre -screening period to confirm eligibility. If the archival tumor tissue does not meet 
FRα criteria, a new biopsy tumor sample may be submitted and used to conf irm this criterion.  
e Complete physical examination (PE) is required at Screening and the 30 -Day Follow -up visit. At all other study visits while on MIRV, patients will have 
symptom -directed PEs.  
f ECOG, PE, pregnancy test for WCBP, and hematology and chemistry labs (if all parameters are within normal range) do not need to be repeated at C1D1 if 
performed within the previous 4 days duri ng Screening.  
g Vital signs (BP and body temperature) will be measured before start of infusion; post infusion vital signs should be collecte d as clinically indicated for 
potential infusion -related reaction.  
h Hematology and chemistry labs may be performed up to 4 days prior to D1 of each cycle, and as clinically indicated while on t reatment, with results reviewed 
before each MIRV administration. In the event of severe toxicity, laboratory tests must be repeated as clinically necessary until the toxicity  resolves or 
stabilizes to baseline level.  
i For women of childbearing potential (WCBP), a urine or serum pregnancy test must be performed within the 4 days prior to D1 of each cycle, and at the 30 -
Day Follow -up visit. It is recommended to perform monthly pregnancy tests for 3 months after the last dose of MIRV. Additional testing may be performed in 
accordance with institutional requirements or local regulation.  
j Baseline ophthalmic exams will be performed by an ophthalmologist within 14 days before C1D1 and will include the following: visual acuity (with/without 
corrective lens; whichever best reflects the patient’s usual functioning), slit lamp examination, intraocular pressure measurement, and indirect fundoscopy. All 
patients who have an ophthalmic exam on study treatment (post -baseline) due to emergence of visual signs or symptoms will have a complete 
ophthalmological examination performed at EOT visit or 30 -Day Follow -up vi sit. 
k Ocular symptoms assessment will be performed by the treating physician or other qualified individual before the start of each cycle. For patients reporting 
> CTCAE Grade 1 ocular symptoms,  treatment will be held until the patient is evaluated by an ophthalmologist for a complete examination.  
l Radio logic  tumor assessment by CT/MRI scan. The same method of radiographic assessment u sed at Screening must be used at all subsequent radiographic 
assessments.  
m If a patient discontinues before documentation of PD, a tumor assessment and CA -125 will be assessed at the EOT or 30 -Day Follow -up visit, if not 
performed within the previous 6 weeks. Tumor assessments and CA -125 will continue to be performed every 12 (± 3) weeks until PD is documented per 
RECIST 1.1 or the patient starts new anticancer therapy. Patients who discontinue MIRV for reasons other than progressive disease (PD) will continue with tumor assessments until documentation of PD or the start of a new anticancer therapy, whichever comes first. Prior to Week 36 (from Cycle 1, Day 1), 
assessments should occur every 6 weeks (± 1 week) as allowed by local requirements but must occur at an interval of no more than 12 weeks. After Week 36, assessment will occur every 12 weeks (± 3 weeks) until documentation of PD, death, the start of new anticancer therapy, or pa tient’s withd rawal of consent 
(whichever occurs first).

17 n CA-125 will be measured at the time of every tumor assessment (± 4 days) (responses will be confirmed according to GCIG criteria Appendix C ). 
o Only AEs/SAEs which are considered related to a study procedure (ie blood draw or fresh tumor biopsy) will be captured during the Pre -screening period, ie 
from the time of signing the Pre -screening consent (if one is utilized) until the signing of the main study informed consent, or until the patient is determined to 
be a screen failure.  
p Blood samples for PK analysis will be taken within 1 hour after MIRV infusion on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 3, and on Day 8 (±24 hours) of Cycles 1 and 3. 
Samples will also be collected prior to dosing on Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 4, and EOT and also at the 30- Day Follow -up, if feasible.  
q Immunogenicity will be assessed in PK samples collected prior to dosing (predose) on C1D1, C2D1, C4D1, at EOT, and 30- Day Follow -up. 
r Survival follow -up assessments will occur every 3 months (±1 month) until death, the patient is lost to follow -up or withdrawal of consent for survival follow -
up, or EOS (which ever comes first). These assessments may be conducted by telephone. Information on the start of new anticancer therapy (including start 
date, therapy type/name, and response on treatment) should be collected. Additional survival follow -up calls may occur p eriodically if needed for regulatory 
requests or at time of database lock for either primary or final analysis.

25 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Target Background  
Folate receptor alpha (FRα) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol- anchored cell surface protein 
encoded by the folate receptor 1 ( FOLR1 ) gene. FRα internalizes folate, which is an essential 
cofactor for one -carbon transfer reactions that are required for DNA and RNA synthesis, cell 
growth and proliferation. Marked upregulation of FRα occurs during neonatal development and 
in cancer, suggesting that the receptor functions primarily under conditions of high folate 
demand. In contrast, normal adult tissues generally lack FRα expression and employ alternative 
transporters such as folate receptor β, reduced folate carrier and proton- coupled folate transporter 
for folate uptake ( Weitman  1992, Mantovani 1994, Elnakat  2004, Kelemen  2006, and 
Investigator Brochure ).  
Published studies have demonstrated FRα overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in various epithelial tumors, particularly the serous and endometrioid histologic subtypes of ovari an 
and endometrial cancers ( Scorer  2010, Garin -Chesa 1993, Kalli 2008, Crane  2012, Dainty  2007, 
Jones 2008, Ab  2015, and Allard  2007). IHC results obtained from patients scre ened or enrolled 
in the Phase 1 Study IMGN853-0401 and Phase 3 Study IMGN853-403 are generally consistent 
with the literature ( Investigator Brochure ). Assessment of the FRα distribution in the PROC 
expansion cohort of IMGN853-0401 demonstrated that approximately 40% of patients have high 
expression.  
Several additional studies have further validated FRα as a target in serous epithelial ovarian 
cancer (EOC). First, quantitative polymerase chain reaction studies show ubiquitous FRα mRNA expression in serous E OC ( Hanker  2012, Hoskins 1998, Hough 2001) and high levels of FRα 
mRNA correlate with poor response to chemotherapy and decreased disease- free survival 
(Chen  2012). Second, both Kalli et al and Crane et al have demonstrated that recurrent tumors 
retain FRα expression comparably to primary tumors as shown by serial biopsy sampling and 
IHC (Kalli 2008, Crane 2012). Third, studies with FRα- specific imaging agents have 
demonstrated real -time FRα expression at primary and metastatic tumor sites ( Fisher  2008, 
Gaillard  2018, Garcia 2013, Garin -Chesa 1993, and van Dam  2011). Finally, a truncated form of 
FRα has been detected in ascites and blood of EOC patients ( Basal  2009, Mantovani 1994), 
further confirming expression in this disease and suggesting that the receptor may serve as a 
circulating biomarker. Collectively, these data suggest that FRα is a promising target in solid tumors, particularly EOC. 
1.2. Mirvetuximab Soravtansine  
Because of its tumor -specific expression and capacity to internalize small and large molecule 
ligands, FRα has emerged as a promising target for antibody drug conjugate (ADC) therapy. 
ADCs combine the specificity of mAb to tumor antigens with the extraordinary cytotoxicity of 
maytansine derivatives, which are potent anti- microtubule agents that target proliferating cells. 
MIRV is an ADC designed to target FRα. It consists of the humanized anti-FRα mAb M9346A attached via a cleavable disulfide linker to the cytotoxic maytansinoid, DM4 ( Figure 1 ).

DM4 is ~2% by weight relative to mAb. 
Due to the nature of the conjugation process, the number of DM4 molecules attached to the mAb 
ranges from 1 to 7 molecules per Ab, with an average of 3 or 4 DM4 molecules per Ab. 
Conjugation of the maytansinoid to the tumor-targeting Ab ensures that the cytotoxic component remains inactive in the circulation. Release of the cytotoxic payload requires binding, internalization, and degradation of the Ab. The released payload then kills the cell by inducing 
G2-M arrest and cell death. Cellular processing of maytansinoid conjugates can also generate 
lipophilic catabolites that cross cell membranes and kill neighboring cells ( Erickson 2006). 
In vitro, MIRV binds cell surface FRα with high apparent affinity (≤ 0.1 nM) and shows potent (IC
50 ≤ 1 nM) and selective cytotoxicity against tumor cells expressing FRα. Cytotoxic effects of 
MIRV in vitro is related to the level of cell-surface expression of FRα ( Ab 2015). MIRV 
additionally demonstrates significant activ ity against FRα positive xenografts, with partial and 
complete remissions observed in ovarian models ( Ab 2015). Together with the selective 
upregulation of FRα in solid tumors, these results provide the rationale for exploring the clinical 
utility of MIRV.
1.3. Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
Ovarian cancer is a lethal disease with 22,530 new cases and 13,980 deaths expected in 2019 in the US ( SEER Cancer Statistics Factsheet 2019 ). The estimated number of new EOC cases in the 
EU (EU27) in 2012 was 44,149 with 29,758 deaths ( EUCAN Cancer Fact Sheet: Ovary 2019). 
The overall 5-year survival for EOC patients is only 44% ( Cannistra 2004, Baldwin 2012).
Recent studies indicate that ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers are not distinct entities, but represent a spectrum of diagnoses that originate in the Mullerian tissue. Primary 
fallopian tube carcinoma and peritoneal cancers are now included in the ovarian cancer staging 
classification ( Cobb 2015, Grant  2010, Naumann 2011, O’Shannessy 2013 ), and are considered 
to be part of EOC with the same treatment and outcomes.

27 Despite considerable improvements in primary therapy, 80% of the patients with advanced EOC 
are expected to relapse during or aft er treatment with platinum-containing regimens 
(Armstrong  2019). Disease recurring within 6 months of platinum-based chemotherapy is 
classified as platinum resistant , whereas, disease recurring longer than 6 months after therapy is 
termed platinum sensitive .  
While PARP inhibitors (eg, olaparib and rucaparib) were initially approved as single- agent 
treatment for EOC patients with BRCA mutations (~15% of EOC) who received ≥ 2 prior 
regimens ( Moore  2019), their greatest benef it appears to be as maintenance therapy, both in the 
recurrent platinum- sensitive ( Mirza 2016 ) and front- line settings ( Gonzalez- Martin  2019, Moore  
2018), with the greatest treatment effect in patients with BRCA mutations or other mechanisms 
of homologous recombination deficiency. 
Like PARP inhibitors, bevacizumab is also approved for EOC in combination with 
chemotherapy and as continued monotherapy in the maintenance setting. Wh ile bevacizumab is 
approved in combination with chemotherapy in the platinum- resistant setting, many patients 
receive it earlier in their disease course based on the approvals in the front -line and recurrent 
platinum- sensitive settings.  For those who do re ceive it in the platinum- resistant setting, 
bevacizumab combinations are limited to patients who have received no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens and are not at risk for bowel perforations (recto-sigmoid involvement, bowel involvement and/or history of bowel obstruction) ( Aghajanian  2012,  Pujade- Lauraine 
2014).  
Those patients with PROC who have received prior bevacizumab, either in the platinum- resistant 
or in the platinum-sensitive setting, have few options. They typically receive subsequent single-
agent chemotherapy. Unfortunately, response rates to single- agent chemotherapy are modest 
(~10 to 15%) and DOR is typically 4 to 8 months ( Cannistra 2010, Matsuo  2010). Similarly , OS 
is poor (median ~11 to 14 months) ( Naumann 2011, Pujade- Lauraine 2014) . Because PROC 
remains a significant unmet medical need, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
(NCCN) guidelines recommend that platinum- resistant patients participate in clinical trials 
(NCCN  Guidelines 2019).  
The ORR with sin gle-agent chemotherapy in this setting is ~12% in the AURELIA study and 
more recently in the CORAIL study, with additional studies reporting an ORR of 5% to 15% in 
similar populations of PROC  (Gaillard  2018, Cannistra  2010, Pujade- Lauraine 2014, Pujade-
Lauraine 2019 ).  
1.4. Current Therapies  
Patients with PROC who have either received bevacizumab or are ineligible for bevacizumab are generally treated with single -agent chemotherapy, leading to the poor outco mes described above 
(Section  1.3).  The single-agent chemotherapies most commonly used include paclitaxel, 
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, and topotecan.

28 1.5. Non-Clinical Studies of Mirvetuximab Soravtansine  
1.5.1. Impact of FRα Expression 
Studies assessing the potency and specificity of MIRV were conducted on a panel of FRα-
positive cell lines with a wide range of FRα expression, as well as on FRα- negative cell lines. 
These studies revealed a positive correlation between the level of FRα expression on the cell 
surface, the amount of maytansinoid catabolites generated, and the degree of sensitivity of the cells to MIRV in vitro . MIRV is not active against low and negative FRα expressing cells. 
1.5.2. Pharmacology 
Results of nonclinical pharmacology studies demonstrate the following: 
• FRα has limited normal tissue expression and marked expression in solid tumors, particularly cancers of the ovary and endometrium ( Investigator Brochure ). In vitro 
studies demonstrated that MIRV binds cell surface FRα with high apparent affinity 
(≤ 0.1 nM) and shows potent (IC
50 ≤ 1 nM) and s elective cytotoxicity against cells 
expressing FRα. MIRV-mediated cytotoxicity involves binding, internalization, and 
degradation of MIRV, which releases DM4. DM4 can be methylated to yield S-
methyl-DM4. Both DM4 and S-methyl-DM4 can inhibit tubulin polymerization and 
microtubule assembly, causing cell death. The lipophilic molecules S-methyl DM4 and DM4 can also diffuse to neighboring cells and induce bystander killing.  
• In vitro cytotoxicity studies suggest that cells sensitive to MIRV express higher leve ls 
of FRα and release 10- to 100-fold more cytotoxic maytansinoid than cells resistant to MIRV.  
• MIRV retains the inherent activities of its Ab moiety, M9346A, including binding affinity (apparent affinity ≤ 0.1 nM) and selectivity for FRα, capacity for uptake, internalization and degradation by FRα-positive target cells, and ability to induce Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro.  
• MIRV demonstrates significant activity against FRα-positive xenografts. Partial and/or complete regressions in xenograft models of EOC were seen at doses of MIRV well below its maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  
1.5.3. Pharmacokinetics  
Nonclinical studies with MIRV cross -reactive (monkey) and non- cross -reactive (mouse) species 
were conducted to define pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters and to determine the stability of the 
linker and impact of conjugation on Ab clearance. An additional PK study with free DM4 was 
conducted in monkey. PK studies demonstrated the stability of MIRV in circulation after IV 
administration, with a d istribution phase lasting about 24 hours followed by a slower terminal 
elimination phase. The data indicated that the PK of MIRV were approximately dose 
proportional within the ranges evaluated (1 to  10 mg/kg). These studies are further detailed in the 
Investigator Brochure .

29 1.5.4. Toxicology 
MIRV was evaluated for toxicity after a single IV injection in cross -reactive (monkey) and non-
cross -reactive (mouse) species. Results of these studies supported the first- in-human (FIH) study 
exploring the safety and tolerability of MIRV when administered once every 3 weeks to patients 
with advanced solid tumors. Potential risks suggested by these studies as well as clinical 
experience with other maytansinoid ADCs include hematologic abnormalities, electrolyte 
alterations, injection site reactions, infusion reactions, immunogenicity, hepatic abnormalities, and peripheral neuropathy. Toxicology studies are further detailed in the Investigator Brochure . 
1.6. Clinical Studies of Mirvetuximab Soravtansine  
1.6.1. First -in-Human Phase 1 Clinical Trial: Study IMGN853 -0401 
The first-in-human ( FIH), Phase 1 study evaluated the safety, PK and pharmacodynamics of 
single-agent MIRV in patients with EOC and other FRα-positive tumors. The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for single- agent MIRV administered Q3W  was determined to be 6.0 mg/kg 
AIBW. Data from this study are detailed in the Investigator Brochure .  
The initial antitumor activity observed with MIRV monotherapy in Study IMGN853-0401, particularly in those patients with PROC, no more than 3 prior lines of therapy and FRα medium 
or high expression per the “PS2+” scoring method [defined by 2+ intensity staining of tumor 
cells with medium ≥50% to <75% of tumor cells and high ≥75% of tumor cells] suggested the potential fo r a significant improvement over single- agent chemotherapy. In the 36 patients with 
PROC who had received no more than 3 prior lines of therapy, and had FRα medium or high expression, MIRV was associated with a confirmed Investigator-assessed ORR of 47%, m edian 
DOR of 5.8 months, and median PFS of 6.7 months, compar ing favorably with results seen with 
single-agent chemotherapy. Similarly, in the subset of 27 patients with FRα-high expression, the confirmed Investigator -assessed ORR was 44%, with median DOR of 7.8 months and median 
PFS of 6.7 months. 
Safety data s uggested that MIRV  was well tolerated, with a safety profile primarily consisting of 
low-grade gastrointestinal (GI) AEs and blurred vision related to corneal keratopathy. The 
treatment -emergent adverse event s (TEAEs ) were manageable with standard medical care and/or 
dose modification, with a low rate (10%) of patients discontinuing MIRV due to a treatment-related TEAE.  
1.6.2. Phase 3 Monotherapy Trial in Patients with Platinum- Resistant EOC, 
Peritoneal, an d Fallopian Tube Cancer: Study IMGN853 -0403 
IMGN853-0403 was a Phase 3 study with the objective to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
single- agent MIRV versus  Investigators Choice ( IC) chemotherapy  in patients with PROC, 
primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer, and whose tumor was FRα- positive (medium 
or high expression) by the Ventana IHC assay using a "10x" scoring method (see Investigator 
Brochure ). The study was designed to compare the efficacy of MIRV to that of approved single-
agent selected standard of care chemotherapy ( paclitaxel, PLD, or topotecan) in patients with

30 PROC who have received no more than 3 prior systemic treatment regimens and for whom 
single-agent chemotherapy is appropriate as the next line of therapy. 
A total of 366 patients were randomized and assigned to MIRV or IC c hemotherapy  groups (248 
and 118, respectively) and were included in the intent- to-treat (ITT) analysis. A total of 352 
patients received at least 1 dose of MIRV or IC c hemotherapy  (243 and 109, respectively). All 
patients in the MIRV group received a dose of 6 mg/kg AIBW Q3W, while the patients in the IC 
chemotherapy  groups received single- agent chemotherapy.  
The primary endpoint was PFS by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC) , which was 
assessed using the Hochberg procedure in the entire study population and in the FRα-high 
population. The Hochberg procedure enables the simultaneous testing of 2 overlapping 
populations. Under this statistical analysis plan, if the p-value of the primary endpoint in either 
population is greater than 0.05, the p-value in the other population needs to be less than or equal to 0.025 to achieve statistical significance. The primary endpoint, PFS, did not reach sta tistical 
significance in either the overall ITT population (p-value = 0.897; HR = 0.981) or in the pre-specified FRα-high population (p-value = 0.049; HR  = 0.693).  
This was the first study to evaluate available chemotherapy specifically in patients with high 
FRα expression. An examination of efficacy in the prespecified  FRα-high population (by the 10x 
scoring method) showed clinically meaningful advantage for those patients randomized to MIRV versus IC chemo therapy across all endpoints. MIRV treatment in PROC patients with high FRα 
expression resulted in an ORR (by BIRC) of 24% (95% CI: 17.2, 31.5) compared with 10% (95% CI: 4.1, 19.3) for patients randomized to IC c hemotherapy (p-value = 0.014), median PFS 
of 4.8 months (95% CI: 4.11, 5.68) versus 3.3 months (95% CI: 1.97, 5.59) for patients 
randomized to IC c hemotherapy  (p-value = 0.049; HR = 0.693), median OS in patients 
randomized to MIRV was not reached (95% CI: 12.58, not estimable) versus 11.8 months (95% 
CI: 9.20, not estimable) for patients randomized to IC c hemotherapy (p-value = 0.033; HR = 
0.618). OS results are not confounded by an imbalance in subsequent anti- cancer therapy. The 
median DOR using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1 per BIRC in the 
FRα-high population in patients randomized to MIRV was 5.7 months (95% CI: 4.17, - ) versus 
4.2 months (95% CI: 3.22, 8.71) for patients randomized to IC c hemo therapy. Consistent with 
the observed tumor shrinkage, CA-125 responses per the Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG) criteria occurred in 53% of FRα response- evaluable patients treated with MIRV versus 
25% in the IC c hemotherapy  group. Analysis of time to second disease progression (PFS2) 
suggests that the clinical benefit observed with MIRV does not diminish the efficacy of subsequent therapy (patient randomized to MIRV median 10.1 months [95% CI: 9.03, 11.20] 
versus 8.4 months [95% CI: 7.10, 9.46] for patients randomized to IC chemotherapy  [p-value < 
0.001; HR = 0.557]). 
Exploratory post-hoc analyses using the "PS2+" scoring method (see Section  1.1) demonstrated 
an even stronger treatment ef fect for MIRV in the high FRα subset defined by this method 
(Moore 2019).  
The efficacy and safety of MIRV from this Phase 3 study were supported by patient -reported 
outcome ( PRO ) data, which showed a larger proportion of patients with a ≥ 15 point 
improvement in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) -

31 QLQ-OV28 Abdominal/GI symptom subscale from baseline to Week 8/9 compared to IC 
chemotherapy  (32% vs 13.7% respectively, p=0.011). 
The MIRV safety profile was predominantly characterized by low- grade nausea (51%), diarrhea 
(40%), and blurred vision (40%). These TEAEs are generally managed and mitigated with 
antiemetics, antidiarrheals, and lubricating/steroid eye drops. In the MIRV group, there were 
fewer ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs, and fewer TEAEs leading to dose reduction or delay and treatment discontinuation (46%, 37%, and 12%, respectively) compared with the IC c hemotherapy  group 
(61%, 45%, and 19%, respectively). While myelosuppression is an important safety issue with PLD and Topo, MIRV is associated with less myelosuppression compared to IC c hemotherapy , 
with lower rates of neutropenia (7% vs. 39% all grade; 0% vs. 21% Grade 3+), 
thrombocytopenia (11% vs. 16% all grade; 0% vs. 4% Grade 3+) and anemia (14% vs. 29% all 
grade; 2% vs. 11% Gra de 3+). Similarly, neurotoxicity is an important safety issue with Pac; 
MIRV, an ADC with the tubulin-directed payload DM4, is associated with less peripheral 
neuropathy than Pac (15% vs. 28% Grade 2+) and less alopecia (3% vs. 22% all grades). The 
safety profile of MIRV in the high FRα subset is consistent with that observed in the overall 
MIRV safety population. 
For MIRV the mean half- life (t
½,) was 115.1 hour (4.8 days), with little evidence of accumulation 
(mean accumulation ratio of 1.102).  
There was no apparent relationship between patients testing positive for anti -drug antibodies 
(ADA) and MIRV exposure.  
Please see the Investigator Brochure  for information on Study IMGN853-0403.  
1.6.3. Conclusion 
The available safety and efficacy data from the 455 patien ts treated with single -agent 
mirvetuximab soravtansine in previous clinical studies are consistent with a positive risk benefit 
assessment. The potential benefit of the anti- tumor activity demonstrated by mirvetuximab 
soravtansine in patients with FRα high platinum resistant ovarian cancer, a population with high 
unmet need, outweighs the risks associated with the well tolerated safety profile, as summarized 
above. 
1.7. Rationale for the Selection of Drug Dose Levels and Dosing 
Schedules  
1.7.1. Mirvetuximab Soravtansine 
The selection of the Phase 3 dose of 6 mg/kg AIBW IV Q3W was based on data obtained from 
Study IMGN853-0401, a FIH study designed to establish the MTD and determine the RP2D of 
MIRV when administered IV as a single-agent in adult patients with FRα- positive solid tumors 
who have relapsed or are refractory to standard therapies. The appropriateness of this dose and 
regimen in patients with PROC was further supported by the results of the Phase 3 study IMGN853- 0403. For  more information please see the Investigator Brochure .

32 1.8. Rationale for the Study Plan  
The design of this study is based on data obtained from both the Phase 1 study (IMGN853-0401) 
and the Phase 3 study (IMGN853-0403), which showed a potential for a clinically meaningful 
ORR and DOR for MIRV when considering what would be expected with available single-agent therapies in this PROC population (eg , 12% ORR in the Aurelia and CORAIL  studies [ Pujade-
Lauraine 2014, Gaillard  2018]). While the prior Phase 3 study did not reach statistical 
significance in the entire population (patients with medium and high FRα expression), those 
patients with high FRα expression showed promising results that, in conjunction with the Phase 1 study results, provide the rationale for conducting this trial. 
This single arm Phase 3 study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MIRV 
administered at 6 mg/kg AIBW Q3W in patients with bevacizumab pretreated , platinum- resistant 
high-grade serous EOC, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, whose tumors express a 
high level of FRα. Patients will be, in the opinion of the Investigator, appropriate for single-agent - therapy for their next line of therapy. FRα positivity (high FRα) will be defined by the 
Ventana FOLRI Assay . Please see the Investigator Brochure  for details re garding scoring 
methodology used for patient selection.

4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
4.1. Study Design  
4.1.1. Overview and Schema  
This Phase 3 study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MIRV in patients with 
platinum- resistant high -grade serous EOC, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, whose

37 tumors express a high level of FRα . Patients will be, in the opinion of the Investigator, 
appropriate for single- agent - therapy. FR α expression will be defined by the Ventana FOLRI 
Assay . 
Approximately 110 patients who have provided informed consent and meet study entry criteria 
will be enr olled to achieve a total of 105 efficacy evaluable patients. Efficacy evaluable patients 
include those who have measurable lesions (per RECIST v1.1) at baseline and  received at least 1 
dose of MIRV.  
Enrolled patients will receive single- agent MIRV at 6 mg /kg AIBW administered Q3W.  
Tumor response will be evaluated by the Investigator using RECIST v1.1. CT or MRI scans will 
be collected for sensitivity analysis by a BICR. 
Patients will continue to receive MIRV  until PD, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, 
death, or until the Sponsor terminates the study (whichever comes first).  Tumor assessments, including radiological assessment by CT/MRI scan, will be performed at 
Screening and subsequently every 6 weeks ( ± 1 week ) from C1D1 for the first 36 weeks then 
every 12 weeks ( ± 3 weeks ) until PD, death, the start of new anticancer therapy, or patient’s 
withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first.  
Patients who discontinue MIRV  for reasons other than progressive disease (P D) will continue 
with tumor assessments until documentation of PD or the start of a new anticancer therapy, 
whichever comes first. Prior to Week 36 (from Cycle 1, Day 1), assessments should occur every 
6 weeks (± 1 week) as allowed by local requirements but must occur at an interval of no more than 12 weeks. After Week 36, assessment will occur every 12 weeks (± 3 weeks) until documentation of PD or the start of new anticancer therapy.
  
All patients who discontinue study drug will be followed every 3 months (± 1 month) until death, lost to follow -up, withdrawal of consent for survival follow-up, or EOS, whichever comes first.  
There will be no interim analysis.  
4.1.2. Dose and Schedule for Mirvetuximab Soravtansine  
MIRV will be administered at 6 mg/kg on Day 1 of every 3- week cycle (Q3W) .

Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for labeling information. 
5.1.2. Mirvetuximab Soravtansine Accountability 
Specific details regarding storage and handling of MIRV can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
Accountability and shipping documents for MIRV must be maintained by the Principal 
Investigator (PI) or designee (eg, the study pharmacist). The Investigator or designee must 
maintain an accurate record of all MIRV received, stored, dispensed, destroyed, and used in an 
Investigational Product Dispensing/Accountability Log or equivalent. These records must always 
be available for inspection, and a copy will be supplied to ImmunoGen on request. Information 
recorded on the Accountability Log will include dates and quantities of drug received, dates and 
quantities of drug dispensed, patient number and initials to whom drug is administered, lot number of drug administered, the recorder’s initials, and dates and quantities of drug destroyed 
or returned. Upon receipt, vials should be visually inspected for vial integrity (ie, cracks or leaks) 
and a record of any damaged or suspect drug should be kept on the Accountability Log. 
Upon completion of the study, all MIRV dispatched to a site must be accounted for and unused 
supplies destroyed according to the site’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) or returned to 
depot (refer to Pharmacy Manual). The original drug reconciliation records shall be maintained at the site and a copy collected and sent to ImmunoGen or designee once a representative of the company has confirmed the drug accountability.  
Drug accountability will be monitored. 
5.1.3. Mirvetuximab Soravtansine Study Treatment Compliance 
MIRV supplied for the study may not be used for any purpose other than the study or 
administered other than as described in this protocol.  
If necessary, MIRV from different drug lots may be mixed in a single- dose administration. 
Under no circumstances is the Investigator allowed to release study drug supplies to any 
physician not named in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Form 1572 (or equivalent) to 
administer these supplies to a patient not enrolled in this study. If investigational supplies are to be dispensed from any facility other than that supervised directly by the PI (ie, hospital 
pharmacy, satellite pharmacy), it is the responsibility of the PI to ensure that all study drug is 
stored and administered as described (re fer to Pharmacy Manual for instructions). 
5.2. Assignment of Patient Number  
Patient numbers are assigned in sequential order as patients sign the pre-screening informed consent to participate.

39 5.2.1. Enrolled Patient Definition  
Patients who have consented to the study and have received at least 1 dose of study treatment, 
are considered enrolled. Patients who are issued a patient number, but who do not successfully 
complete the screening process and are not treated will be considered screen failures. Patient numbers for patients who screen fail will not be re -issued. 
5.2.2. Patient Assignment to Dosing Regimens 
All patients will receive MIRV 6  mg/kg AIBW Q3W.  
5.3. Blinding Methods  
Not applicable as this is an open- label, single -arm study. 
5.4. Study Treatment Administration  
5.4.1. Premedicati on for Study Treatment  
All patients must receive 325 to 650 mg of acetaminophen/paracetamol (PO or IV), 10 mg IV dexamethasone, and 25 to 50 mg diphenhydramine (IV or PO) (equivalent drugs of similar drug 
classes is also acceptable) approximately 30 min before each infusion of MIRV. If individual 
patients require more intensive treatment to prevent infusion- related reactions (IRRs), 
investigators may modify the regimen accordingly. An antiemetic  medication  (eg, 5- HT
3 
serotonin receptor antagonists such as palonosetron, granisetron or ondansetron or appropriate alternatives) is recommended before each MIRV dose and may be used any time at the discretion of the treating physician. 
5.4.2. Prophylactic use of Eye Drops 
5.4.2.1. Corticosteroid Eye Drops  
All patients will be mandated to use corticosteroid eye drops as prescribed by the treating 
physician unless the risk outweighs the benefit as per the ophthalmologist/physician. All patients will be instructed to self -administer 1% prednisolone (Pred Forte
® or generic equivale nt) 6 times 
daily on Days -1 to 4 and QID on Days 5 to 8 of each cycle during the study. For individual patients who cannot tolerate the preservative contained in 1% prednisolone, other corticosteroid eye drops may be substituted (eg, difluprednate 0.05%; Durezol

to 8 of each cycle at a frequency prescribed by the ophthalmologist.  
5.4.2.2. Lubricating Artificial Tears  
Patients will be mandated to use preservative -free, lubricating artificial tears on a daily basis (as 
directed by the product label or the treating physician). Patients should be advised to wait at least 
15 minutes after corticosteroid eye drop administration before instilling lubricating eye drops.

5.4.3.1. Calculation f or Adjusted Ideal Body Weight  
The total dose of MIRV is calculated based on each patient’s AIBW using the following 
formula:  
Adjusted Ideal Body Weight (AIBW)  
AIBW = IBW1 + 0.4 (Actual weight – IBW1) 
Where:  
Ideal Body Weight (IBW)  
IBW1 (female) = 0.9H1-92 
1H=height in cm; W=weight in kg)  
The weight used for calculation should be obtained before study drug administration on C1D1 
(-14 days) and thereafter should only be modified for significant (≥ 10%) changes in body weight (not influenced by weight gain or loss attributed to fluid retention).  
5.4.3.1.1. Preparation  
MIRV is an experimental anticancer drug, and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, 
caution should be exercised when handling this compound. It is recommended that gloves and 
protective garments be worn during preparation. The desired amount of drug should be 
withdrawn from the vial(s) and diluted using 5% dextrose to a final concentration as outlined in the Pharmacy Manual.  
Note: MIRV is incompatible with saline (0.9% sodium chloride). Therefore, dilutions should be made using 5% dextrose. Infusion bags must be labeled with the protocol number, 
patient number, storage temperature, dose, and volume of MIRV filtered into the bag, or labeled 
according to institutional protocol. Once the solution is prepared, the infusion bag should be 
stored at room temperature protected from direct sunlight, and the infusion must be completed within eight hours of preparation. Please refer to Pharmacy Manual for further details. 
If necessary, MIRV  from different drug lots may be mixed in a single- dose administration. 
5.4.3.1.2. Administration  
MIRV is administered at 6  mg/k g AIBW  as an IV infusion following preparation as outlined in 
the Pharmacy Manual. Details on required and compatible infusion materials are also included in the Pharmacy Manual.  
At C1D1 MIRV should be administered at a rate of 1 mg/min; after 30 min, the rate can be 
increased to 3  mg/min if well tolerated. If well tolerated after 30  min at 3  mg/min, the MIRV 
infusion rate may be increased to 5 mg/min. Subsequent infusions may be delivered at the tolerated rate. Therefore, the overall length of infusion will vary depending on dose and patient tolerability. After infusion, the IV line should be flushed with 5% dextrose as needed (PRN) to ensure delivery of the full dose.

5.5.1.3. Monitoring and Management of Nausea and Vomiting 
Treatment -related nausea (46% all grade; 1% Grade 3+) and vomiting (16% all grade; 
1% Grade 3+) have been reported in patients treated with MIRV, despite premedication with 
dexamethasone. Therefore, it is recommended that an a ntiemetic  (eg, 5- HT 3 serotonin receptor 
antagonists such as palonosetron, granisetron or ondansetron) medication is provided before each MIRV dose ( Section  5.8.1). Additional antiemetics may be used any time at the discretion of the 
treating physician, according to institutional or other practice guidelines American Society of

44 Clinical Oncology (ASCO), ESMO, and NCCN. Patients should be advised to contact their 
treating physician at the first sign of vomiting or worsening nausea.  
5.5.1.4. Monitoring and Management of Diarrhea  
Mild to moderate diarrhea has been reported in patients treated with MIRV. Patients should be 
advised to contact their treating physician at the first sign of diarrhea. Patients may then be 
treated according to standard institutional practice. One suggested regimen would be the 
administration of loperamide 2  mg at the first sign of loose stool, with repeat dosing every 
two hours until symptoms resolve ( Wadler  1998 ). 
5.5.2. Ocular Disorders  
Changes in visual acuity resulting from reversible keratopathy have been reported in other studies of DM4-containing immunoconjugates that use the SPDB linker ( Younes 2012). Patients 
receiving MIRV in the Phase 1 and 3 trials (IMGN853 -0401, IMGN853 -0403) reported ocular 
AEs consistent with reversible keratopathy/corneal epitheliopathy.  
5.5.2.1. Monitoring and Preventive Measures  
In early dose escalation of Study 0401, a relationship was observed between MIRV plasma 
exposure and likelihood of an ocular event and response. Exposure-response modeling suggested 
that a dose of 6.0 mg/kg AIBW provided adequate exposure for response while also maintaining 
overall exposure within a range that decreased the potential for ocular AEs. Due to the 
observation of ocular disorders consistent with reversible keratopathy/corneal epitheliopathy in 
patients treated with MIRV, ocular function will be carefully monitored. Ocular symptom 
assessments will be performed at baseline and at Day 1 of every cycle thereafter ( Table 2).  
Complete ophthalmologic exams will be performed in all patients at baseline and every other cycle thereafter if there is a TEAE reported.  
Patients are advised to avoid using contact lenses while on MIRV. Baby shampoo and a soft cloth should be used to clean the eyes, and a warm compress at bedtime may be used to decrease 
any possible inflammation on the eyelid’s surface. Pleas e refer to Section  5.4.2.1 and 
Section  5.4.2.2 for details on the prophylactic use of steroid eye drops and lubricating artificial 
tears. The use of UVA/UVB sunglasses is recommended in full daylight during the study. The use of temporary lower punctal plugs to increase lubrication of the eyes is opt ional if lubricating 
artificial tears and corticosteroid eye drops are not sufficient. If patients report signs or 
symptoms of ocular disorders, including, but not limited to, blurred vision or eye irritation, the management and dose modification guidelines outlined in Table 5 should be followed.  
5.5.2.2. Management and Dose Modification Guidelines  
If a patient develops ocular symptoms of any grade, the patient is required to have a complete 
examination by an ophthalmologist. If a patient develops ≥ CTCAE Grade 2 ocular symptoms, 
treatment with MIRV must be interrupted. Treatment should not be interrupted solely for Grade 
2 ocular signs (eg, Grade 2 keratopathy) unless they are also associated with Grade 2 ocular symptoms. Treatment with MIRV may resume if ocular symptoms improve to Grade 1 or 
baseline within 28 days of the next scheduled MIRV dose (r efer to Table 5 for details). If ocular

45 symptoms last longer than 28 days, resumption of MIRV, with or without dose reduction, may be 
considered for those patients who have experienced clinical benefit if agreed upon between the 
Sponsor and the Investigator. Subsequent eye examinations will be scheduled to occur in every other cycle going forward, from the time that the AE was initially reported, and at eit her the EOT 
visit or 30-Day Follow-u p Visit after treatment discontinuation, even if the results of the 
patient’s ocular exam shows no obvious clinical findings. Management of treatment- emergent 
ocular AEs with inflammatory characteristics should include corticosteroid eye drops and/or other measures as indicated by an ophthalmologist.

induced pneumonitis may be immediately life threatening. If a patient presents with signs or 
symptoms consistent with pneumonitis and/or other clinically meaningful signs or symptoms of pulmonary toxicity, the patient should be immediately evaluated. Patients are advised to notify 
their treating physician immediately if they experience new or worsening shortness of breath, 
cough, or respiratory distress. Patients who are asymptomatic may continue dosing of MIRV with close monitoring. 
The management and treatment guidelines outlined in Table 6 should be followed.

Prompt attention should be given to the correction of potential electrolytes imbalance, especially 
hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. 
5.5.5. Potential Infusion -related Reactions  
Some patients treated with IV  infusions of therapeutic drugs have experienced concurrent 
infusion-related reactions (IRR) (see CTCAE Version 5.0). The signs and symptoms may vary 
and include for example, headache, fever, facial flushing, pruritus, myalgia, nausea, chest 
tightness, dyspnea, vomiting, erythema, abdominal discomfort, diaphoresis, shivers, lightheadedness, hypotension, palpitations, and somnolence. Anaphylaxis might occur at any 
time during an infusion. Before any infusion is started, appropriate medical personnel, 
medicat ion (eg, epinephrine, inhaled beta agonists, antihistamines, and corticosteroids), and 
other required resources to treat anaphylaxis must be readily available. In general, Investigators 
should manage acute allergic or hypersensitivity reactions according t o Institutional practices. 
General guidelines for the management of acute IRRs and for subsequent retreatment are 
provided in Table 7. Delayed IRRs may occur; therefore, patients should be advised to seek 
immediate medical treatment if symptoms newly develop and/or recur after discharge from 
clinic.  
Patients who experience ≥ Grade 2 IRR during or immediately after administration of MIRV will 
have blood drawn for determination of drug concentration and ADAs to MIRV. The sample 
should be obtained within three hours of the onset of the reaction and one week later. Such 
patients should undergo all scheduled efficacy and safety evaluations.

50 5.5.6. Discontinuation of Mirvetuximab Soravtansine Due to Toxicity 
MIRV should be discontinued in the case of the following treatment- related events:  
•Grade ≥ 3 cardiac event (excluding Grade 3 hypertension) ( Section  5.5.1.1)
•Grade ≥ 3 pneumonitis event ( Section  5.5.3)
•Non-hematologic events of Grade 4 severity  (Section  5.5.1.1)
•Ocular events of Grade 4 severity ( Section  5.5.2.2 )
•Failure to meet re -treatment criteria within 1 cycle (21 days) after the missed dose
due to insufficient recovery from a treatment- related toxicity  unless otherwise
specified in the management guidance for a particular toxicity . In such cases,
continuation of MIRV  may be considered for those patients who have experienced
clinical benefit if agreed upon between the Sponsor and the Investigator.
5.6. Discontinuation  of the Patients from the Study or Study Treatment
5.6.1. End of Treatment
Patients will continue to receive MIRV until they present with PD per RECIST 1.1, as assessed 
by study Investigator, unacceptable toxicity, withdraw consent, or death, whichever comes first, 
or until the Sponsor terminates the study. Study treatment and/or participation in the study may 
be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Investigator. The following may be reasons for the Investigator to remove a patient from the study drug: 
•The patient suffers an intolerable AE
•Noncompliance, including failure to appear at one or more study visits
•The patient was erroneously included in the study
The reason for treatment discontinuation must be captured in the clinical trial database . Any AEs 
experienced up to the point of discontinuation and 30 days thereafter must be documented. All serious adverse events (SAEs), and those AEs assessed by the Investigator as at least possibly related to study drug should continue to be followed until they resolve or stabilize, whichever 
comes first. Patients will continue to be followed for OS, after discontinuing study drug 
(Section  9.3.3).  
5.6.2. End of Study 
Discontinuation from participation in the study will be documented in the clinical trial database . 
Reasons for EOS include withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, death, or study termination by Sponsor.  
5.6.3. Withdrawal of Consent 
The patient or legally authorized representative acting on behalf of the patient is free to withdraw 
consent to study treatment and/or participation in the study at any time irrespective of the reason. The Investigator must make every effort (eg, telephone, email, letter ) to determine the primary 
Mirvetuximab Soravtansine (IMGN853) Dated 28 August 2020 
Protocol Number IMGN853-0417 
 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
ImmunoGen, Inc.  
51 reason for this decision and record this information. Study treatment must be discontinued, and 
no further assessments conducted. Further attempts to contact the patient are not allowed unless 
safety findings require communication or follow-up. If the patient or legally authorized representative withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain 
and continue to use any data collected before withdrawal of consent. All biological samples that have been already collected will be retained and analyzed at a later date. The patient or legally 
authorized representative may request destruction of any samples, and the Investigator must 
document this in the site study records. The SAP will specify how early withdrawals from treatment will be accounted for in the analyses of efficacy endpoints. Patients who have withdrawn from the study cannot be re-treated in the study and their inclusion and patient number must not be reused. 
5.6.4. Lost to Follow- up 
A study patient  will be considered lost to follow-up if the patient  repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. The Investigator should make all 
efforts to contact the patient and to determine the patient’s health status, including at least her 
vital status  (in accordance with applicable regulations related to privacy and confidentiality) . A 
patient should not be considered lost to follow-up until due diligence has been completed and 
documented. The following actions must be taken if a patient  fails to return to the clinic for a 
required study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact the patient  and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the patient  on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the patient  wishes to and/or should continue in 
the study. 
• In cases in which the patient  is deemed lost to follow -up, the Investigator or designee 
must make every effort to regain contact with the patien t (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient ’s last known mailing address or 
local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the 
patient ’s medical record.  
Should the patient  continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from 
the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up. 
5.7. Period of Observation  
For purposes of this study, the period of safety observation extends from the time of informed consent until the 30- Day Follow -up visit unless additional follow-up safety information is 
requested as described in Section  9.3. Short- term follow -up for patients who discontinue study 
drug without documented PD will be followed per RECIST 1.1 every 6  weeks ( ± 1 week ) from 
C1D1 for the first 36 weeks then every 12 weeks ( ± 3 weeks ) until PD, until the patient starts 
new anticancer  treatment, the patient dies, or the patient withdraws consent, whichever comes 
first. All patients will be followed every 3  months (± 1 month) for survival until death, lost to 
follow-up, withdrawal of consent for survival or until EOS, whichever comes fi rst.

All concomitant medications and supportive therapy taken within four weeks of Cycle 1, Day 1 
and through 30 days after last study treatment must be recorded in the clinical database.   
5.8.1. Antiemetic and Antidiarrheal  Medications  
An antiemetic  (eg, 5- HT 3 serotonin receptor antagonists such as palonosetron, granisetron or 
ondansetron) medication is recommended before each MIRV dose; additional antiemetics and/or 
antidiarrheal (eg, loperamide) medications may be used any time at the discretion of the treating 
physician. 
5.8.2. Folate- Containing Supplements  
Folate -containing supplements should not be taken during the study. 
5.8.3. Antineoplastic Therapy  
All non-study related antineoplastic therapy, including but not limited to cytotoxic, immunotherapy, and VEGF-targeted therapy, is prohibited while on study drug.  
5.8.4. Hematopoietic Growth Factors  
Patients receiving recombinant erythropoietin ( EPO ) or darbepoetin-α before study start may 
continue to receive pretreatment doses.  
The use of erythropoietic and granulocyte growth factors in accordance with ASCO guidelines 
may be implemented at the discretion of the treating physician. 
5.8.5. Anticoagulants 
The use of anticoagulant agents is allowed. Please see Section  5.8.8 if using apixaban and 
rivaroxaban due to CYP3A interaction potential. 
5.8.6. Methods of Contraception  
Women of childbearing potential must agree to use highly effective contraceptive method(s) 
while on study drug and for at least 3 months after the last dose of MIRV. A woman of 
childbearing potential is a woman who is considered fertile, following menarche and until 
becoming post- menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization  methods include 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. 
The following birth control methods may be considered highly effective (failure rate of less than 
1% per year):  
• Combined (estrogen and progesterone) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation 
− Oral 
− Intravaginal

53 − Transdermal  
• Progesterone-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: 
− Oral 
− Injectable  
− Implantable 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner   
• Sexual abstinence  
Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of contraception if 
it is consistently employed as the patient’s preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered acceptable by local regulatory agencies and Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IECs /IRBs ). Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptom-thermal, post-
ovulation methods, etc) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted b y local regulations/guidelines, then it does 
not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for patients participating at sites in this 
country/region. 
Patients should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the 
fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. To participate in the study 
WCBP must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) from the day of study 
medication initiation (or 14 days before the initiation of study medication for oral contraception) 
through the duration of study treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose of MIRV. If 
there is any question that a WCBP will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that patient should not be entered into the study. 
5.8.7. Other Concomitant Medications  
Medications for the treatment of AEs or cancer symptoms (eg, packed red blood cells and pain medications), are allowed. Prophylactic use of steroids and/or antihistamines will be considered if needed. Additionally, medications (not addressed above) used to treat underlying medical conditions at study entry including antiemetics and antidiarrheals will be allowed to continue.  
5.8.8. Medications that are CYP3A or MDR1 Substrates or CYP3A Substrates with 
Narrow Therapeutic Index  
In vitro metabolism studies demonstrated that DM4 is predominantly metabolized by thiol s-methyltransferase (TMT) to form S -methyl DM4, which is further metabolized into sulfoxide-
methyl- DM4. As S -methyl DM4 has been shown to be primarily metabolized by CYP3A, its

54 exposure could potentially be increased in the presence of strong CYP3A inhibitors. Drinking 
greater than one serving (250 mL) of grapefruit juice per day should be avoided. 
Both DM4 and S-methyl DM4 are substrates for MDR1 efflux transporter. Their exposure could 
potentially increase  in the presence of MDR1 efflux transporter. In vitro metabolism data also 
indicates  that DM4 is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.The risk of a significant  in vivo 
drug-drug interaction caused by inhibition of CYP3A4 or MDR1 is unknown. T reatment of 
patients with concomitant medications that are inhibitors of MDR1, sensitive substrates of 
CYP3A or are CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be used with caution and carefully monitored ( Appendix D ).  
5.9. Overdose and Medication Error  
5.9.1. Overdose  
There is no known treatment/antidote available for MIRV. Supportive measures should be instituted if an instance arises in which a patient suffers an overdose of study drug. 
5.9.2. Medication Error  
The Sponsor must be notified within 24 hours of any error leading to the administration of either 10% more or 10% less than the intended dose; in such c ases, the event must be reported in the 
clinical trial database . If an error resulted in a SAE, a Serious Adverse Event form must be 
submitted within 24  hours of the event (see Section  8.2.1).  
6. PHARMACOKINETIC, IMMUNOGENICITY , AND 
BIOMARKER ASSESSMENTS  
6.1. Pharmacokinetic Assessments – Mirvetuximab Soravtansine  
The PK properties of MIRV and key metabolites will be evaluated following IV administration, as outlined in Table 2 and Table 8. Plasma samples will be collected to determine the 
concentration of MIRV (conjugate, total Ab, free DM4, S-methyl DM4 and possibly other metabolites).  
Blood samples for PK analysis will be taken at the following timepoints:

57 they will sign the main study ICF and proceed with remaining screening procedures per the 
Schedule of Assessments. In some cases, the pre -screening ICF and main study ICF may be 
merged into a single ICF based on site-specific guide lines or preference.  
7.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are assessed during Screening (within 28 days before the first dose of MIRV on Cycle 1, Day 1). All screening evaluations must be completed and 
reviewed to confirm t hat potential patients meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will 
maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or 
record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Procedures conducted as part of the patient’s 
routine clinical management and obtained before signing an ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol- specified criteria and were performed 
within the timeframe defined in the Schedul e of Assessments ( Table 2). A patient is considered 
enrolled when they have received their first dose of MIRV  (Section  5.2.1). 
7.3. Confirmation of Disease Diagnosis  
At Screening, disease diagnosis, and current disease status are confirmed from information in the source record ( Table 2 ). 
7.4. BRCA M utation Status  
The BRCA mutation status from prior testing (information in the source record) will be recorded 
(Table 2). Patients with a BRCA mutation (germline mutation or somatic mutation in tumor 
tissue) are classified as positive and patients who were tested and shown to not have a BRCA 
mutation will be classified as negative. Patients without known BRCA mutation status in the 
source record are classified as unknown. If a patient with unknown status is tested and is found to have a BRCA mutation, this patient is considered BRCA mutation positive in analyses. 
7.5. Demographic/Medical History  
The age, sex, race and ethnicity of the patient are to be recorded during Screening for all patients who consent to the study ( Table 2). 
During the Screening period, a complete medical history will be compiled for each patient. The history will include the background and progress of the patient’s primary malignancy and include a description of all prior therapies for the primary malignancy. 
7.6. Physical Examination, Weight, and Height  
Physical examination (PE), height (Screening only) and weight must be performed as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2). A complete PE, including assessments of general 
appearance, skin, head (eyes, ears, nose, and throat), neck, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extremities, and neurological system, will be completed at Screening and at the 30- Day 
Follow-up Visit. Directed PEs will be completed at additional time points as specified in the Schedule of Assessments.

Vital signs include BP and body temperature. These signs are measured as outlined in Table 2. 
7.8. Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
A standard, single 12- lead ECG will be performed within 28 days prior to first dose.  
7.9. Ocular Symptom Assessment and Ophthalmic Examination  
7.9.1. Ocular Symptom Assessment  
Ocular symptom assessment will be performed before the start of each cycle by the treating 
physician or other qualified individual. For patients reporting > CTCAE Grade 1 ocular symptoms, study drug will be held until the patient is evaluated by an ophthalmologist for a 
complete examination. The ocular symptom assessment will also be performed at EOT and the 
30-Day Follow -up visit.  
7.9.2. Ophthalmic Examination 
An ophthalmic examination will be performed at Screening (within 14 days prior to first dose of 
study drug) by an ophthalmologist and will include the following: distant visual acuity, best 
corre cted visual acuity, slit lamp examination, intraocular pressure measurement, and indirect 
fundoscopy. Patients who experience ocular TEAEs while on study will have a complete 
ophthalmologic exam performed at the emergence of the symptoms and at every other cycle 
thereafter. All patients who have an ophthalmic exam on study treatment (post- baseline) will 
have a complete ophthalmologic exam performed at the EOT visit or 30-Day Follow-up visit 
(Table 2). 
7.10. Laboratory Assessments  
Local laboratories will be used for the analysis of scheduled hematology, biochemistry, coagulation, and other tests collected as part of safety monitoring. Screening labs ( Table 9) will 
be performed within 14 days of first dose. Repeat testing on Cycle 1, Day 1 is not required if 
tests were obtained within 4  days of dosing and are within acceptable ranges. Repeat testing will 
be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2) and as clinically indicated.  
Note that before each administration of study drug, laboratory results must be reviewed to 
evaluate for potential toxicity.

7.11. Preg nancy Screen  
All WCBP will complete a serum beta -human chorionic gonadotropin (β- hCG) or urine 
pregnancy test within  4 days before the first dose of study drug and urine or serum pregnancy 
tests within 4 days of each study drug administration and at the 30-Day Follow-up visit. It is 
recommended to perform monthly pregnancy tests for 3 months after the last dose of MIRV. 
Additional testing may be performed in accordance with institutional requirements or local regulation. Pregnancy tests must be negative for the patient to be enrolled and to continue to receive the study drug ( Table 2).  
If a patient becomes pregnant or suspects pregnancy while participating in this study, the 
Investigator and Sponsor must be informed immediately ( Section  8.2.2) and the patient will be 
withdrawn from study drug. See Section  8.2.2 for more details.  
7.12. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status  
ECOG PS ( Appendix A ) will be assessed during Screening and at other times specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2). An assessment is not necessary on Day 1 of Cycle 1 if the

60 Screening assessment was obtained within the prior 4 days. ECOG is also assessed at EOT and 
30 day follow up visit. 
7.13. Tumor Response Assessment  
7.13.1. Radiological Imaging 
Radio logic tumor evaluation by CT or MRI of chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be performed 
within 28 days before first dose of study drug and every 6 weeks (±1 week) from C1D1 for the 
first 36 weeks on study and every 12 weeks (±  3 week s) thereafter (Table 2). Patients who 
discontinue study treatment for reasons other than progressive disease (PD) will continue with 
tumor assessments until documentation of PD or the start of a new anticancer therapy, whichever 
comes first. Prior to Week 36 (from Cycle 1, Day 1), assessments should occur every 6 weeks 
(± 1 week) as allowed by local requirements but must occur at an interval of no more than 
12 weeks. After Week 36, assessment will occur every 12 weeks (± 3 weeks) until 
documentation of PD or the start of new anticancer therapy. The same method of radiographic 
assessment used at Screening must be used at all subsequent radiographic evaluations. Copies of 
all imaging scans must be obtained and sent to a central imaging vendor designated by 
ImmunoGen as outlined in the Imaging Manual. The central imaging vendor will assess the 
quality of the images. The imaging vendor will be responsible for the formation and management of the blinded independent central review (BICR) which will be used as a sensitivity analysis of ORR and DOR by investigator. 
Tumor response will be assessed by the Investigator using RECIST v1.1 ( Eisenhauer  2009 ). 
Response as determined by the Investigator will be recorded in the clinical trial database.  
The central imag ing vendor will ensure that the central radiologists remain blinded to the local 
assessment from the Investigator and other unblinding information. This and all other imaging 
procedures will be documented in an independent review charter agreed upon between ImmunoGen and the imaging vendor before initiation of any BICR reviews. 
Note: It is very important that the same method of radiologic assessment be used 
throughout the study and that the same lesions are followed.  
7.13.2. CA-125 
Serum CA -125 assessments will be performed within 14 days prior to the first dose of study 
drug, and at each radiologic tumor assessment (± 4 days) ( Table 2). CA -125 should be assessed 
by the same laboratory throughout the study.  
8. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
8.1. Recording Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse Events (AEs), including those attributed to study procedures, will be documented in  the 
clinical trial database  and monitored continuously throughout the study from the time of 
informed consent until 30 days after the patient’s last study treatment. 
Mirvetuximab Soravtansine (IMGN853) Dated 28 August 2020

Confidential and Proprietary 
ImmunoGen, Inc.  
61 Only AEs/SAEs which are considered related to a study procedure (ie blood draw or fresh tumor 
biopsy) will be captured during the pre-screening period, ie from the time of signing of the pre-
screening informed consent (if one is utilized) until the time of signing of the main study informed consent, or until the patient is determined to be a screen failure. All AEs and S AEs, 
regardless of causality, will be captured after the main study ICF has been signed. 
SAEs will continue to be followed by ImmunoGen Pharmacovigilance until resolution, 
stabilization or return to baseline. Beyond this defined reporting period, any unsol icited SAE 
assessed as related to the study drug by the Investigator and reported to ImmunoGen will be collected and processed. Additional information obtained after database lock, will reside solely in the safety database.  
The Investigator should follow and provide updates for all AEs until clinical recovery is complete, laboratory values return to normal, the patient stabilizes, or death occurs, to ensure the safety of the patients. This may mean that observations continue beyond the last planned visit pe r 
protocol and that additional investigations may be requested by the Sponsor. 
8.1.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
8.1.1.1. Adverse Event  
An AE is any noxious, pathologic, or unintended change in anatomical, physiologic, or metabolic function as indicated by physical signs, symptoms, or laboratory changes occurring in 
any phase of a clinical study, whether or not considered study drug- related. This includes an 
exacerbation of a pre-existing condition. AEs include: 
• Worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of conditions present at the 
onset of the study 
• Intercurrent illnesses  
• Drug interactions 
• Events related to or possibly related to concomitant medications 
• Abnormal laboratory values (this includes significant shifts from baseline within the range of normal that the Investigator considers to be clinically important) 
• Clinically significant abnormalities in PE, vital signs, and weight  
Note that PD should not be reported as an AE unless it is considered to be drug- related by the 
Investigator. 
All AEs, including AEs attributed to study procedures, occurring from the time of study 
informed consent until 30 days after last study treatment must be reported in the clinical database, regardless of the severity or relationship to study drug. Only AEs which are considered 
related to a study procedure (ie blood draw or fresh tumor biopsy) will be captured during the 
pre-screening period, ie from the time of signing the pre-screening consent (if one is utilized) 
until the signing of the main study informed consent, or until the patient is determined to be a 
screen failure.  The Investigator should treat patients with AEs appropriately and observe them at 
Mirvetuximab Soravtansine (IMGN853) Dated 28 August 2020 
Protocol Number IMGN853-0417 
 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
ImmunoGen, Inc.  
62 suitable intervals until the events stabilize, return to baseline or resolve. AEs may be discovered 
through observation or examination of the patient, questioning of the patient, complaint by the 
patient, or by abnormal clinical laboratory values. 
In addition, AEs may also include laboratory values that become significantly out of range. Such 
abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute AEs if they induce clinical signs or 
symptoms, are considered clinically significant (eg, cause study drug discontinuation or constitutes in and of itself an SAE, or require therapy), and should be recorded in the clinical 
database under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associated with them. In the event of an out-of-
range value, the laboratory test should be repeated until it returns to normal or baseline or can be explained and the patient’s safety is not at risk.  
8.1.1.2. Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Is life -threatening 
• Requires in patient hospitalization  
• Requires prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• A persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalization  
Note that hospitalization is defined as admission to treat a clinical AE. The following events 
would not be considered hospitalizations for SAE reporting purposes: 23-hour hold for 
observation, admission to a hospice facility or nursing home, respite care, outpatient surgery, social admission (eg, a homeless patient) or admission not associated with a precipitating clinical 
AE (eg, elective or pre-planned surgery, or in-patient administration of subsequent 
chemotherapy, etc).  
8.1.1.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
There are no AEs of special interest (serious or nonserious) associated with MIRV.

ImmunoGen, Inc.  
63 8.1.2. Classification of Adverse Events 
All AEs will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0 (effective 27 November 2017). If 
the AE is not listed in the CTCAE v5.0, it should be graded based on the description given in 
Table 10. 
Table 10: Adverse Event Severity  
Severity  Definition  
Grade 1 (Mild)  No limitation of usual activities.  
Grade 2 (Moderate)  Some limitation of usual activities.  
Grade 3 (Severe)  Inability to carry out usual activities.  
Grade 4 (Life -threatening)  Immediate risk of death.  
Grade 5 (Fatal)  Resulting in death.  
Relationship of an AE or SAE to study medication is to be determined by the Investigator based 
on the definitions in Table 11.

64 Table 11: Adverse Event Causal Relatedness  
Relationship to Product(s)  Definition  
Not Related  No relationship between the event, including laboratory test 
abnormality, and the administration of study drug. There is no temporal relationship and there is unambiguous evidence supporting another 
cause.  
Unlikely Related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to study drug administration which makes a causal 
relationship improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals or 
underlying disease provide plausible explanations.  
Possibly Related A clinical event,  including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of study drug, but which 
could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals. Information on study drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Probably Related A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of study drug, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and 
which follows a clinically reasonabl e response on withdrawal of study 
drug. The association of the clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, must also have some biologic plausibility, at least on theoretical grounds. 
Definitely Related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to study drug administration, and which 
cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. 
The response to withdrawal of the study drug should be clinically plausible. The event m ust be definitive pharmacologically or 
phenomenologically, using a satisfactory re- challenge procedure if 
necessary.  
8.2. Adverse Events  
8.2.1. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Any SAE, regardless of relationship to study medication, which occurs in a patient from t he time 
of study informed consent until 30 days after the last study treatment, must be recorded by the 
clinical site on an SAE report form. Only SAEs which are considered related to a study 
procedure (ie blood draw or fresh tumor biopsy) will be captured during the pre-screening 
period, ie from the time of signing the pre-screening consent (if one is utilized) until the signing 
of the main study informed consent, or until the patient is determined to be a screen failure. The SAE must also be recorded in the clinical trial database, including the Investigator’s assessment 
regarding the relationship of the SAE to the study drug. The Investigator will promptly supply all information requested by the Sponsor (or contract research organization [CRO]) regarding the SAE.  
Mirvetuximab Soravtansine (IMGN853) Dated 28 August 2020 
Protocol Number IMGN853-0417 
 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 
ImmunoGen, Inc.  
65 The Investigator  must submit the SAE Report Form to ImmunoGen Pharmacovigilance (or 
designee). This form must be completed and submitted within 24 hours of the Investigator’s 
learning of the event using the contact information printed on the SAE form and contained within the SAE form completion instructions. Follow-up information must also be submitted 
using a new SAE Report Form. 
When reporting SAEs, the following additional points should be noted:  
• The underlying diagnosis or syndrome should be reported as the primary SA E term, 
rather than the signs or symptoms (signs and symptoms may be described in the 
narrative).  
• An event term of “Death” should not be reported as an SAE, but rather be recorded as an outcome of a specific SAE term. Initially, the event term of “death” c an be used 
until the actual cause of death is known. If an autopsy was performed, the autopsy report should be provided. 
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to ensure that each Investigator receives a copy of any suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) report (CIOMS/MedWatch) regarding the study drug and that the report is submitted to the appropriate national regulatory agencies.  
The Investigator (or Sponsor or contracted designee) must promptly report all SUSARs to the 
IRB/IEC for review in accordance with national regulations. IRB/IEC notification of the SUSAR may take the form of a submission of a copy of the CIOMS/MedWatch report or other format 
accepted by the IRB/IEC. A copy of the CIOMS/MedWatch report and notification to IRB/IEC 
should be retained in the site’s study files.  
In addition to CIOMS/MedWatch reports, the Sponsor will also notify (through annual updates 
to the Investigator Brochure) the Investigators and IRBs/IECs of all deaths that occur during the 
study, irrespective of relationship to study medication. 
8.2.1.1. Reporting of Disease Progression 
Disease progression is an anticipated occurrence in  oncology drug development and is not an AE 
unto itself.  
Progression of disease should not be reported as an SAE term; any serious medical 
event/condition that results from progression of underlying disease, if untoward, should be reported as the SAE.  
Progression of disease with a fatal outcome does not need to be reported as an AE term. The 
applicable protocol CRF page(s) pertaining to death should be appropriately completed however, 
as disease progression.  
8.2.2. Reporting a Pregnancy  
Pregnancy and lactation are exclusion criteria. Women of child bearing potential, defined as a sexually mature woman who has not undergone surgical sterilization or who has not been 
naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (ie, who has had menses any time in 
the preceding 12 consecutive months) must agree to use highly effective contraceptive methods

ImmunoGen, Inc.  
66 (as defined in Section  5.8.6) while on study drug and for at least 3 months after the last dose of 
MIRV . In addition, it is recommended that patients undergo monthly pregnancy test for at least 
3 months after the last dose of MIRV. 
The Sponsor must be immediately notified in the event of a pregnancy occurring during the 
study and through 30 days after a patient’s last dose of study drug. If a patient becomes pregnant 
the patient will be withdrawn from study drug. Pregnancy is not an AE unto itself and therefore 
should not be reported as an AE. 
All pregnancies wi ll be recorded on a Pregnancy Report and submitted according to the contact 
information on the form and in the completion guidelines. 
Pregnancies, with the permission of the mother, will be followed to completion or termination 
using the designated sections of the Pregnancy report form. 
Any SAE, occurring during the pregnancy to the mother or fetus, would require that a study SAE 
form also be completed/submitted.  
9. STUDY ACTIVITIES  
All study visits and assessments that must be performed during the study and follow- up are 
included in Table 2. 
9.1. Screening Visit  
The Investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all patients screened for entry into the study, including those who are subsequently excluded. The reason(s) for exclusion must be recorded.  
9.1.1. Standard of Care Assessments  
In some cases, clinical asses sments performed before obtaining informed consent may be used to 
qualify the patient for the study if performed within the screening window. These include 
radiologic tumor assessment, PEs, laboratory results, urinalysis, or other assessments which may 
be considered part of standard of care. In these cases, repeat assessments may not be necessary 
before enrollment, unless individual parameters require further study or confirmation and are clinically appropriate.  
Note that safety blood tests, and PE do not need to be repeated if normal and conducted within 4 
days prior to C1D1. 
9.2. End of Treatment Visit  
Patients may voluntarily withdraw from the study drug at any time for any reason, and without 
prejudice to further treatment. In addition, patients may be withdrawn by the Investigator if they do not feel the patient is deriving clinical benefit or because the patient is experiencing 
unacceptable toxicity. The reasons for which a patient may be prematurely discontinued are 
listed in  Section  5.6. The clinical trial database will capture reasons for withdrawal.

67 Patients who withdraw or are removed from the study treatment will have an EOT visit within 7 
days of the decision to discontinue study drug. Patients will undergo assessments as outlined in 
Table 2.  
9.3. Follow-up Assessments  
9.3.1. 30-Day Follow-u p Visit  
A 30-Day Follow -up visit will occur 30 days (+14 days) after last dose of MIRV and should 
occur prior to the start of new anticancer therapy .  
In some cases, nonserious AE observations may continue beyond the safety visit. All ocular AEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or return to baseline. In these instances, additional information may be requested by ImmunoGen to adequately categorize the nature of the toxicity. 
All SAEs  will be followed until they resolve, stabilize or return to baseline , regardless of time 
from last dose or last visit.  
9.3.2. Response Follow- up 
Patients who discontinued MIRV  for reasons other than PD will continue with tumor 
assessments until documentation of PD or the start of a new anticancer therapy, whichever 
comes first. Prior to Week 36 (from Cycle 1, Day 1), assessments should occur every 6 weeks 
(± 1 week) as allowed by local requirements but must occur at an interval of no more than 
12 weeks. After Week 36, assessment will occur every 12 weeks (± 3 weeks) until 
documentation of disease progression or the start of new anticancer therapy. 
9.3.3. Survival Follow- up 
All patients  who discontinue MIRV  for any reason will be followed for survival after disease 
progression as per Investigator, or after start of a new anticancer therapy. Survival status will be assessed every 3  months (± 1 month) until death, lost to follow-up, withdrawal of consent for 
survival follow-up or until EOS, whichever comes first. Additional survival follow- up calls may 
occur periodically if needed. 
10. STATISTICAL METHODS  
This is a Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the ORR of MIRV in patients with high FRα 
expressing, high- grade PROC.  
All patients who have received at least 1 dose of MIRV will comprise the Safety Analysis 
Population.  
The Efficacy  Evaluable Population will include all patients who have received at least 1 dose of 
MIRV  and have measurable lesions at baseline (per RECIST v1.1). The primary efficacy 
analysis of ORR and all other efficacy analyses will be based on the Efficacy  Evaluable 
Population. The safety analysis will be based on S afety Analysis Population.

68 All statistica l analyses will be performed using SAS statistical software Version 9.4 or later, 
unless otherwise noted. For categorical variables, the number (n) and percent of each category 
within a parameter will be presented. For continuous variables, the sample size (n), mean, median, and standard deviation, as well as the minimum and maximum values, will be presented. 
Missing data will not be imputed unless otherwise stated. There will be a detailed description of 
patient disposition, patient demographics, and basel ine characteristics.  
A SAP will fully describe the planned analyses for this trial and will be finalized prior to database lock.  
10.1. Sample Size  
Primary endpoint is confirmed ORR per Investigator assessment. 
A sample size of 105 efficacy evaluable patients achieves 9 1% power to detect a difference in 
ORR of 1 2% (2 4% vs . 12%) using a 1- sided binomial test. The target significance level ( 1-sided 
α level) is 0.025. The actual significance level achieved by this test is 0.0242. These results 
assume that the ORR is  12% under the null hypothesis and 24-% under the alternative 
hypothesis. 
Patients who have received at least 1 dose of MIRV  but are not efficacy evaluable will be 
included in S afety Analysis Population. However, these patients will not be included in the 
Efficacy Evaluable Population and will be replaced for the purpose of sample size determination. 
A total of approximately 110 patients will be enrolled to achieve 105 efficacy evaluable patients.  
10.2. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
PK parameters will not be calculated due to the sparse sampling scheme in this study. Summary 
statistics of the concentration at each time point (nominal time) will be presented. Graphical presentation of the data may also be completed usi ng nominal time.  
10.3. Safety Analyses  
Safety analyses will be based on the Safety Analysis Population. 
AEs and concomitant medication will be listed.  
AEs will be coded using the latest Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
version and summariz ed per system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization-Drug Dictionary 
(WHO -DD; 01 September 2019 or later version). A dictionary listing of all unique concomitant 
medications used  in the study will be provided. 
All hematology, blood chemistry, and vital signs will be listed per patient for each assessment and descriptive statistics will be tabulated for select criteria. Changes from baseline in 
hematology, blood chemistry, and vita l signs will be summarized by treatment. Shifts in 
hematology and blood chemistry from Baseline values will be summarized. Plasma also will be evaluated for the presence of ADA.

69 10.4. Efficacy 
Unless stated otherwise in the SAP, efficacy analyses will be performed on the Efficacy 
Evaluable Population. 
10.4.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis 
10.4.1.1. Objective Response Rate 
The primary endpoint is ORR, which includes best response of CR or PR. 
The primary endpoint of O RR (objective response = CR + PR) will be estimated along with a 
95% CI by the Clopper-Pearson method based on the efficacy evaluable population.  
The primary analysis of ORR will be conducted after all efficacy evaluable patients have:  
• undergone at least 4 post-baseline tumor assessments, or 
• experienced radiological disease progression, or  
• died or had clinical progression within 105 days of first dose of study drug, or 
• withdrawn from study for other reasons 
10.4.2. Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint  
The key secondary endpoint of Investigator- assessed DOR will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier 
method for survival function estimate.  
The initial analysis of DOR will be conducted at the time of primary analysis of ORR.  An 
updated analysis of DOR will be conducted 12 months after the primary analysis of ORR, at the 
end of the study. 
10.4.3. Additional Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The additional secondary endpoints of Investigator- assessed PFS and OS will be estimated using 
Kaplan -Meier method for survival function e stimate.  
10.5. Interim Analysis  
There are no planned interim analyses for this study. E fficacy  data generated in the MIRV 
program in patients with  FRα high expression (by the PS2+ scoring method), includes a 44% 
Investigator- assessed ORR in the 27 patients in I MGN853 -0401 and a 38% Investigator- assessed 
ORR in the 116 patients in IMGN853-0403 ( Moore 2019). In addition, an analysis of patients 
derived from both Study 0401 and Study 0403 who are eligible for this study (n=70), revealed an ORR by investigator of 31.4% with a DOR of 7.8 months. Thus , an interim analysis for futility 
in the current study in the same or a very s imilar population  is not warranted.

This clinical study will be conducted according to ICH- GCP E6  (R2) guidelines. Quality 
oversight shall be maintained through proactive and continual risk assessment and mitigation at 
the operational level. GCP quality assurance audits will be conducted as needed as continued 
compliance oversight.  
12. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
PROCEDURES  
12.1. Ethical and Regulatory  
This clinical study will be conducted by the Sponsor, the Investigator, delegated Investigator 
staff and sub-Investigator(s), in accordance with the protocol, the Declaration of Helsinki, the 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for  GCP, and 
all applicable local regulatory requirements.  
This clinical study will be recorded in a free, publicly accessible, internet-based registry, no later than 21 days after the first patient enrollment, in compliance with applicable regulatory 
requirements and with ImmunoGen public disclosure commitments. 
12.1.1. Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee  Approval 
Before initiation of the study, the Investigator must provide the Sponsor with a copy of the 
written IRB/IEC approval of the protocol, the main study ICF and the pre- screening ICF (latter 
ICF is applicable for sites requesting permission to pre- screen for FRα positivity (high FRα) 
before performing any additional study related tests). This approval must refer to the ICF(s) and to the study title, study number, and version and date of issue of the study protocol, as given by 
the Sponsor on the cover page of the protocol. 
Status reports must be submitted to the IRB/IEC at least once per year or as per institutional 
guidelines. The IRB/IEC must be notified of completion of the study and a final report must be 
provided to the IRB/IEC. A copy of these reports will be sent to the study clinical monitor or designee. The Investigators must maintain an accurate and complete record of all submissions

71 made to the IRB/IEC, including a list of all reports and documents submitted. AEs, which are 
subject to expedited reporting to the FDA or other regulatory agencies (SUSARs), must be 
submitted promptly to the IRB/IEC.  
12.1.2. Patient Information and Consent 
An ICF that includes information about the study will be prepared and given to the patient, or the 
patient’s legally authorized  representative(s). The ICF will contain all FDA and ICH required 
elements and be approved by an IRB/IEC. The ICF must be in a language understandable to the 
patient or the patient’s legally authorized representative(s). Before enrolling in the clinical study, 
the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the clinical study will be explained to the patient 
or the patient’s legally authorized representative(s) in a form understandable to him or her. After the patient has been given ample time to read and ask questions regarding the ICF and has been 
informed that participation is voluntary, the patient or the patient’s legally authorized 
representative(s) must give consent in writing. If the patient or the patient’s legally authorized representative(s) is un able to read, oral presentation and explanation of the written ICF and 
information to be supplied must take place in the presence of an impartial witness. Consent must be confirmed orally and by the personally dated signature of the patient or by the patie nt’s 
legally authorized representative(s). The witness and the person conducting the informed consent 
discussions must also sign and personally date the informed consent document. The informed 
consent process must be recorded and dated in the patient’s source document. 
A copy of the signed and dated consent document(s) must be given to the patient or the patient’s 
legally authorized representative(s). The original signed and dated consent document will be 
retained by the Investigator. Patient confidentia lity will be maintained as outlined in 
Section  12.3. 
The Investigator must not undertake any measures specifically required solely for the clinical  
study until valid informed consent has been obtained. 
A model of the pre-screening and the main study ICF will be provided to the sites separately for 
this protocol. The main study consent can be used to confirm a patient’s consent to all study 
procedures and all study- specific screening tests. The pre-screening ICF can be used to pre-
screen patients for FRα status before performing any additional study related tests. If a patient is 
eligible based on FRα expression level, the patient will be provided the main study consent and 
only after signing the main study ICF will additional study- specific screening tests be performed. 
Alternatively, the patient can be consented on both pre-screening and main study ICF at the same time; and FRα testing and study- specific screening assessments can be carried out in parallel.  
Patients  must be consented to the most current version of the ICF during their participation in the 
study.  
12.2. Investigators and Study Administrative Structure  
Before initiation of the study, the Investigators must provide the Sponsor with a completed Form FDA 1572 or equivalent form . Study medications must be administered only under the 
supervision of the Investigators listed on this form. Curriculum vitae must be provided for the Investigators and sub-investigators listed on Form FDA 1572 or equivalent for m.

duties and functions. The Investigator must maintain a list of sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has delegated significant study related duties. 
12.3. Patient Confidentiality  
Patient names will not be supplied to the Sponsor. If the patient name appears on any documents, it must be redacted before a copy of the document is supplied to the Sponsor. Study findings stored on a computer will be stored in accordance with local data protection laws. Patient blood 
and tissue samples, and radiographic images sent to outside laboratories and/or CROs are 
identified by study patient number only to ensure maintenance of confidentiality. The patient consent form will state publications resulting from this study will not refer to patient name or 
include any other information that might disclose the identity of the patient. The patients will be 
told that representatives of the Sponsor, a designated CRO, the IRB/IEC, or regulatory authorities may inspect their medical records to verify the information collected, and that all 
personal information made available for inspection will be handled in strictest confidence and in 
accordance with local data protection laws. The Investigator will maintain a personal patient identification list (patient numbers with the cor responding patient names) to enable records to be 
identified.  
12.4. Study Monitoring  
Sponsor or its designee will monitor the conduct of the trial on a regular basis throughout the duration of the study, according to the monitoring plan and in compliance with ICH- GCP E6  
(R2). Monitoring of the study will serve to ensure: (a) The rights and well-being of human 
subjects are protected; (b) The reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable from 
source documentation; and (c) The conduct of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), with GCP, and with applicable regulatory requirement(s). 
The study monitor will train site personnel on the conduct of the trial. The monitor will assess 
the trial site’s compliance with the pr otocol and will periodically review and verify a sample of 
the patient data recorded on CRFs against source documentation. The study monitor will also

available to ImmunoGen. 
12.7. Protocol Adherence  
Each Investigator must adhere to the protocol as detailed in this document and agree that any 
changes to the protocol must be approved by ImmunoGen’s authorized representative in writing 
before seeking approval, where necessary, from the IRB/IEC, Research Ethics Committee (REC), or Ethics Review Board (ERB). Each Investigator will be responsible for allowing only those patients who have met protocol eligibility criteria to be enrolled.  
Modifications to the protocol should not be made without agreement of the Investigators and ImmunoGen. Changes to the protocol will require written IRB/IEC, REC, or ERB 
approval/favorable opinion before implementation, except when the modification is needed to 
eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to patients. The IRB/IEC/REC/ERB may provide expedited review and approval/favorable opinion for minor change(s) in ongoing studies that have the 
approval/favorable opinion of the IRB/IEC/REC/ERB. ImmunoGen will submit all protocol 
modifications to the appropriate regulatory authorities in accordance with the governing regulations. 
When immediate deviation from the protocol is required to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to 
patients, the Investigator will contact ImmunoGen , if circumstances permit, to discuss the 
planned course of action. Any departures from the protocol must be fully documented in the source documentation. 
Prospective waivers or exemptions are not permitted.  
12.8. End of Study  
EOS will occur 12 months after the primary analysis for ORR. If p atients are still receiving 
clinical benefit from MIRV at EOS , either the study will be amended to allow those patients to 
continue to receive study treatment with limited data collection (eg SAEs, dosing information) 
until they are no longer benefiting or patients will be given the option to roll-over to a long- term 
extension study.  
12.9. Study Termination  
If the Sponsor, an Investigator, or Clinical Study Monitor discovers conditions arising during the 
study that indicate that the clinical investigation should be halted due to an unacceptable patient risk, the study must be terminated after appropriate consultation between ImmunoGen and the 
Investigators. In addition, a decision on the part of ImmunoGen to suspend or discontinue 
development of the study drug may be made at any time.

82 APPENDIX  B. RESPONSE DEFINITIONS (RECIST 1.1)  
(Eisenhauer 2009) 
DEFINITIONS  
Baseline:  Baseline is defined as the most recent assessment performed before the first dose of 
study treatment. Baseline assessments must be performed within the period defined in the 
protocol eligibility criteria.  
Measurable Lesions:  Except for lymph nodes (described below), measurable lesions are defined 
as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be 
recorded) as ≥ 10 mm with CT scan (if CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the 
minimum size of a measurable lesion is twice the slice thickness).  
• To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and recorded. 
• MRI may be substituted for contrast- enhanced CT for lesions at some anatomical 
sites, but not for lesions in the lungs. The minimum size for measurability is the same as for CT (10 mm) as long as the sca ns are performed with slice thickness of 5 mm 
and no gap. If MRI is performed with thicker slices, the size of a measurable lesion at baseline should be twice the slice thickness. In the event there are inter -slice gaps, 
this also needs to be considered in determining the size of measurable lesions at baseline.  
Non-measurable Lesion:  all other lesions (or sites of disease) including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis), are considered non-measurable.  
• Lymph nodes that have a short axis < 10mm are considered non- pathological and are 
not to be recorded or followed.  
• Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pneumonitis, inflammatory breast dise ase, and abdominal masses 
(not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non- measurable.  
Target Lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and five 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, are to be identified as target lesions and 
measured and recorded at baseline.  
• Target lesions are to be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) to represent all involved organs, and to be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  
• It may be the case that on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.

83 • Target lesions will be measured at each assessment (longest axis for non-nodal 
lesions, shortest axis for measurable malignant nodal lesions). 
Non-target Lesions:  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including all non- measurable lesions 
(including pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis) and all measurable lesions 
over and above the five target lesions are to be identified as non- target lesions and recorded at 
baseline.  
• Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, 
unequivocal progression of each is to be recorded throughout follow-up.  
• Lymph nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered non- pathological and are 
not to be recorded or followed. 
Special Considerations  
Clinical Examination of Lesions:  Superficial or visible lesions that cannot be assessed by CT 
scan or MRI will only be considered for response assessment if these lesions are biopsy-proven 
metastatic lesions and ≥ 10 mm in diameter. These lesions will be considered non- measurable 
and thus non- target for response assessment.  
Cystic Lesions : Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if 
non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesion.  
Bone Lesions:  Bone scan, positron emission testing ( PET) scan or plain films are not considered 
adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to 
confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions. 
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic- blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by cross-sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above. 
• Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.  
Lesions with Prior Local Treatment:  Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an 
area subjected to other locoregional therapy, are usually not considered measurable; however, if they meet the following criteria, they may be considered for study: 
• there has been prior documented progression in the lesion by at least 2 sequential CT 
or MRI scans performed after the completion of radiation, or  
• histopathological evidence of progression 
Additionally, if such lesions meet the criteria f or measurability, they may be considered target 
lesions.

84 Imaging Methods 
The same method of assessment and the same technique used to characterize each identified and 
reported lesion at baseline should be used during each follow-up assessment. Imaging- based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed 
cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam (referring to biopsy-proven visible 
lesions(s) at the vaginal apex).  
Chest X -ray: Lesions that are identified on chest X -ray must be confirmed and followed by CT 
scan. If there is/are pre -existing chest lesion(s) before the baseline tumor assessment, a chest X-
ray is not necessary to assess those lesions. The pre- existing chest lesion(s) must be assessed  at 
baseline and followed by CT scans. 
Conventional CT or MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion is twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (eg, for body scan) except for lung.  
CA-125: Tumor marker CA -125 alone cannot be used to assess response or determine 
progression; however, it will be followed. CA -125 assessments will be performed as indicated in 
Table 2. Patients whose CA -125 is above the upper normal limit at baseline will need to have 
their values normalize to ≤ upper normal limit, in addition t o complete disappearance of 
measurable or evaluable disease, to be considered in complete response.  
Other methods of assessment, PET-CT, ultrasound and FDG-PET should not be used for 
response assessment in this study. 
Time Point Assessments 
Radio logic tumo r evaluation by CT or MRI of chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be performed 
within 28 days before first dose of study drug and every 6 weeks (±1 week) from C1D1 for the 
first 36 weeks on study and every 12 weeks (± 3 week s) thereafter.  
At baseline, tumors and lymph nodes are classified and documented as target or non- target per 
the definitions provided above. It is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same organ as a single item (eg, ‘multiple liver metastases’).  
At all post- baseline evaluations, the baseline classification (target, non -target) is to be maintained 
and lesions are to be documented and described in a consistent fashion over time (eg, recorded in the same order on source documents and CRFs). 
For targ et lesions, measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation. All tumor 
measurements must be recorded in millimeters.  
At each assessment, a sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesion s will be calculated and reported. The baseline sum of the longest 
diameters (SLD) will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression 
in the measurable dimension of the disease. The lowest SLD (nadir) since, and including, the baseline value will be used as reference for evaluating progression.

85 After baseline, the actual size of the target lesion should be documented, if possible, even if the 
lesions become very small. If in the opinion of the radiologist, the lesion has likely disappeared, 
0 mm should be recorded. If the lesion is present but too small to measure, an indicator of “too small to measure” will be provided on the CRF (a default value of 5 mm will be imputed during analysis).  
Non-target lesions are to be assessed q ualitatively (present, resolved, or unequivocal 
progression) and new lesion, if any, are to be documented separately. At each evaluation, a time point response is to be determined for target lesions, non- target 
lesions, new lesions and overall. 
Time Point Response Criteria  
Target Lesion Time Point Response (TPR)  
Complete Response 
(CR)  Disappearance of all target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10mm.  
Partial Response (PR)  At least 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (SoD of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline SoD  
Progressive Disease (PD)  At least a 20% increase in the SoD of target lesion, taken as reference the 
smallest (nadir) SoD since and including baseline.  In addition to the relative 
increase of 20%, the SoD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at 
least 5 mm.  
Stable Disease (SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD. 
Not Applicable (N/A)  No targe t lesions identified at baseline  
Unable to Evaluate 
(UE)  One or more target lesions are not imaged and the remainder of the SoD compared with the nadir SoD does not meet the criteria for PD  
If the target lesion for a patient meets the criteria for both PR and PD at a given time point, the target lesion response is PD.  
If the nadir SoD is 0 (ie, the patient had a prior target lesion CR), the re-appearance of any prior target lesions to any degree constitutes PD. 
Non-Target Lesion TPR  
Complete Response 
(CR)  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor marker 
level if tumor marker at baseline is above the upper normal limit. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis)  
Non-CR/Non -PD Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of CA -
125 above the normal limits if CA-125 at baseline is above the upper 
normal limit 
Progressive Disease (PD)  Unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of 
overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.

87 Confirmation - The main goal of confirmation of objective response is to avoid overestimating 
the observed response rate. For patients with an overall response of PR or CR a given time point, 
changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments that should be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. However, the presence or absence of confirmation is not considered when assigning a time point response. 
Best Overall Response - Be st overall response, incorporating confirmation requirements, will be 
derived during statistical analysis from the series of time point responses and need not be 
considered when assigning response at any time point.

88 APPENDIX  C. GYNECOLOGIC CANCER INTERGROUP (GCIG) 
CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION OF CA -125 
(Rustin  2004) 
On the basis of the available data and extensive discussions among the cooperative groups within 
the GCIG, it is  recommended that the following definition of response be used in ovarian cancer 
trials so that response can be measured by either RECIST or CA-125 criteria. If the response is 
evaluable by both criteria, then the date of response will be the date of the e arlier of the two 
events.  
Definition of response:  
• ≥ 50% reduction in CA-125 levels from baseline 
• the response must be confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days 
• the pretreatment sample must be ≥ 2.0 times the ULN and within two weeks before starting tre atment  
• the date of response corresponds to the date when the CA-125 level is first reduced by 50%  
To calculate CA -125 responses accurately, the following rules apply:  
• Intervening samples and the 28-day confirmatory sample must be less than or equal to (within an assay variability of 10%) the previous sample 
• Variations within the normal range of CA- 125 levels will not interfere with the 
response definition.  
Evaluation of Progression 
Progression or Recurrence based on serum CA-125 levels will be defined on the basis of a 
progressive serial elevation of serum CA-125, according to the following criteria:  
a. Patients with elevated CA -125 pretreatment and normalisation of CA-125 must show 
evidence of CA -125 greater than, or equal to, two times the upper normal li mit on 
two occasions at least one week apart, or  
b. Patients with elevated CA -125 pretreatment, which never normalises must show 
evidence of CA -125 greater than, or equal to, two times the nadir value on two 
occasions at least one week apart, or  
c. Patients with CA-125 in the normal range pretreatment must show evidence of 
CA125 greater than, or equal to, two times the upper normal limit on two occasions at least one week apart.  
Elevated values must be confirmed by two separate measurements obtained at least one week 
apart. CA -125 progression will be assigned the date of the first measurement that meets the 
criteria as noted. Patients are not evaluable by CA -125 if they have received mouse antibodies 
(unless the assay used has been shown not to be influenced by HAMA [Taylor 2005 and Rustin 2005]) or if there has been medical and/or surgical interference with their peritoneum or pleura during the previous 28 days.

89 A patient may be declared to have progressive disease on the basis of either the objective

Timing of CA- 125 assessments:  
The GCIG recommends that CA -125 measurements be taken at specific time intervals.  
• The first sample would be collected within two weeks before treatment is started  
• CA-125 assessments will be pe rformed as indicated in Table 2.

90 • For each patient, the same assay method must be used and the assay must be tested in 
a quality -control scheme. Patients are not evaluable by CA -125 if they have received 
mouse antibodies or if there has been medical and/or surgical interference with their peritoneum or pleura during the previous 28 days.  
This CA -125 response definition has been produced to evaluate relapse therapy. If assessing 
therapy that includes two treatment modalities for relapse (eg, surgery and chemotherapy), any CA-125 response results from both treatments. CA-125 cannot distinguish between the effects of 
each treatment. To calculate response rates  in protocols, an ITT analysis should be used that 
includes all patients with an initial CA -125 level of at least twice the ULN as eligible and 
evaluable. In addition to calculating response rates in protocols, it is advisable to record those patients who have both a CA-125 response and whose CA- 125 level falls to within the normal 
range.

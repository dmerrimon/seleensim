Protocol Version #4.0  7 19 February 2016  Cohorts A ,B and C :  
• To determine the safety profile of 
etirinotecan pegol (NKTR -102) 
 
TREATMENT SUMMARY  All patients will receive e tirinotecan pegol  
(NKTR -102) 145 mg/m2 IV as 
monotherapy once ever y 21-day cycle .  
Response  assessment of the CNS and 
systemic disease  will be performed by MRI 
and/or CT scan at baseline and every 2 
cycles .  Patients will rec eive therapy until 
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, 
withdrawal of consent, or investigator' s 
decision.  
SAMPLE SIZE  Cohort A: 12 NSCLC patients  
Cohort B:  3 SCLC patients  
Cohort C: 12 patients with MBC to the 
brain  
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  This is a single -stage phase II design with 
CNS disease control rate at 12 weeks as the 
primary endpoi nt.  In cohort A, 12  patients 
with NSCLC will be enrolled . In Cohort C 
12 patients with MBC  will be enrolled   In 
Cohort A or Cohort C, i f 3 or more patients 
have controlled disease  in either cohort  
(SD, PR, or CR) in the CNS at 12 weeks, 
we will be able t o reject the null hypothesis 
that the disease control rate is not larger 
than 5%, assuming a one -sided significance 
level of 5% .  The sample size and cutoff 
provide 81% power with an effective alpha 
level of 2% (one -sided).  This calculation is 
based on bi nomial probabilities , assuming 
an alternative of 33%  
The study will also include an exploratory , 
observational group of  up to  3 patients with 
SCLC  (Cohort B) .

2 BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Lung and breast cancers  
Lung cancer  
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer -related deaths  in the United States, with estimated 
159,000 deaths in 2013 (Siegel, Naishadham et al. 2013) , and worldwide, with 1.3 million deaths 
per year. (Jemal, Bray et al. 2011)  Lung cancer frequently metastasizes to the brain, resulting in 
an extremely poor prognosis with few effective therapies. (Sorensen, Hansen et al. 1988)    
         
In non -small cell lung cancer, newly diagnosed brain metastases are often treated with r adiation 
therapy and/or surgery.  Concurrent chemoradiation for CNS disease is not supported by 
adequate evidence.  There is no standard of care treatment chemotherapy for relapsed or 
progressing CNS disease, though pemetrexed chemotherapy or erlotinib tar geted therapy can 
work in selected patient groups for limited periods of time.  In a series of 39 patients with 
NSCLC and brain metastases who received pemetrexed as a second -line or further -line 
treatment, 15 patients (38%) had a partial response in the b rain, and 12 patients (31%) had stable 
disease. (Bearz, Garassino et al. 2010)  In a phase II study of erlotinib as second -line therapy in 48 
Chinese patients with NSCLC and asymptomatic brain metastases, response (P R or CR) was 
observed in 67% of patients with known EGFR mutations, 33% with wild -type tumors, and 68% 
with unknown EGFR mutation status. (Wu, Zhou et al. 2013)  Of note, neither pemetrexed nor 
A phase II study of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR -102)  in patients with advanced lung cancer and refractory brain 
metastases  
 
Protocol Version #4.0  11 19 February 2016  erlotinib has been sho wn to have significant activity in squamous histology, thus further 
necessitating the need for a better agent that is potentially efficacious for brain metastases of all 
NSCLC histologies.  
 
In small cell lung cancer, several studies have suggested that br ain metastases are as sensitive to 
chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and etoposide, as extracranial disease at least initially, with 
response rates ranging from 27% to 85% for previously untreated patients (Lee, Murphy  et al. 
1989; Twelves, Souhami et al. 1990; Kristjansen, Soelberg Sorensen et al. 1993)  and 22% to 
50% for previously treated patients. (Kristensen, Kristjansen et al. 1992; Groen, Smit et al. 1993; 
Postmus, Smit et  al. 1995; Kaba, Kyritsis et al. 1997; Grossi, Scolaro et al. 2001; Korfel, Oehm 
et al. 2002)  However, there is also evidence that the response rate for brain metastases is 
significant lower than that for systemic disease. (Seute, Leffers et al. 2006)  While the addition of 
whole brain radiation can increase the response rate but does not necessarily improve overall 
survival, (Postmus, Haaxma -Reiche et al. 2000)  the use of pro phylactic cranial irradiation is 
indicated for patients with response to chemotherapy and can improve survival, (Slotman, Faivre -
Finn et al. 2007)  suggesting that treatment of brain metastasis is important.  Finally , while 
topotecan is the only FDA approved therapy for the second line treatment of small cell lung 
cancer, (von Pawel, Schiller et al. 1999; von Pawel, Gatzemeier et al. 2001; O'Brien, Ciuleanu et 
al. 2006; Eckardt,  von Pawel et al. 2007)  many clinicians prefer the use of irinotecan instead 
with its favorable response and toxicity profile.  Therefore, etirinotecan pegol appears ideally 
suited for both the systemic and CNS treatment of SCLC that is resistant or refra ctory to 
platinum.  
 
 Metastatic breast cancer (MBC)   
 
Despite  progressive  improvements in disease control rates and improved survival in metastatic 
breast cancer, brain metastasis remains a devastating complication in the natural history of 
advanced disea se progression and is invariably associated with worsened survival in advanced 
disease .(Sanna, Franceschelli et al. 2007)   Standard therapy includes surgical resection for oligo 
metastatic disease, whole brain radiation, and stereotactic surgery when feasible. In general, 
systemic chemotherapy has poor CSF penetration and the brain is considered sanctuary for 
metastatic disease .(Freilich, Seidman et al. 1995)  With the limited current treatment options, new 
treatment  approaches and novel therapeutic agents are needs to enrich our armamentarium in 
treatment of brain metastasis.  
 
While all subtypes of breast cancer can be complicated by the development of brain metastasis, 
triple negative and HER2 -positive disease carr y the highest risk of CNS involvement .(Sanna, 
Franceschelli et al. 2007)  
  
2.2 Etirinotecan pegol  
NKTR -102 (etirinotecan pegol) is a polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugate prodrug of irinotecan 
having topoisomerase  I inhibitor antitumor activity .  Irinotecan is a topoisomerase I  inhibitor 
approved worldwide for the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) .  Irinotecan is indicated as a 
component of first -line therapy in combination with 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) and leucovorin for 
patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum  or as a single agent in patients whose

metastases  
 
Protocol Version #4.0  12 19 February 2016  disease has recurred or progressed following initial fluorouracil -based therapy .  Irinotecan has a 
half-life (T½) of approximately 9 hours in humans and upon repeat dosing demonstrates the 
saw-tooth pharmacokinetic ( PK) profile that typifies a short T½ for both irinotecan and its major 
active metabolite, 7 -ethyl -10-hydroxy -camptothecin (SN38), with a T½ of about 47 hours .  
NKTR -102 was specifically engineered to provide an extended release of irinotecan thereby 
provid ing a more continuous exposure to the active metabolite SN38 .  By reducing peak 
concentration and markedly prolonging the T½ of SN38 to about 50 days, it is possible that 
anti-tumor activity can be enhanced while maintaining a favorable toxicity profile .  In addition, 
the large NKTR -102 molecule does not freely pass out of intact vasculature, which may account 
for relatively higher concentrations of the compound and the active metabolites in tumor tissues 
in in vivo models, where the local vasculature may b e relatively more permeable .  
2.2.1  Preclinical data  
NKTR -102 doses are expressed as irinotecan equivalents throughout the entire  protocol .  
 
Pharmacokinetic, pharmacologic, and toxicologic characteristics of NKTR -102 have been 
studied in mice, rats, and dogs .  Pharmacokinetic studies in mice, rats, and dogs showed that 
NKTR -102 disposition kinetics are dominated by the polymer moiety .  In all species examined, 
dosing of NKTR -102 resulted in sustained and greater exposure to the active metabolite SN38 
than dosing with irinotecan at equivalent doses and schedules .  Interspecies differences in the 
metabolism of NKTR -102 were observed .  Rodents achieved higher SN38 exposure than dogs, 
presumably because of more rapid and extensive cleavage of irinotecan due to  higher level of 
esterases in rodents than in dogs.  
 
The anti -tumor activity of NKTR -102 was evaluated in mouse models of human colorectal 
(HT29), non -small cell lung (NCI H460), breast (MCF -7), ovarian (A2780), and gastric 
(NCI -N87) tumors .  NKTR -102 was  active in all models, with dose -related increases in number 
of regressions and tumor growth delay .  Tumor growth delay was frequently the highest possible 
value, with evidence of sustained tumor growth suppression for 2 to 10 weeks after 
administration of  the last dose .  In contrast, irinotecan resulted in little to no suppression of 
tumor growth .  In an HT29 colorectal tumor model, NKTR -102 was eliminated very slowly from 
the tumor (T½=17 days) and achieved higher and more sustained tumor exposures to its  active 
metabolites compared with irinotecan .  The increased tumor exposure following NKTR -102 
correlated with superior and sustained suppression of tumor growth .  The relative benefit was 
sustained in combination studies comparing anti -tumor activity of N KTR -102 to irinotecan each 
given with other therapy .  These included NKTR -102 given with cetuximab in a mouse model of 
human DLD -1 colorectal tumor, with bevacizumab in a mouse model of human HT29 colorectal 
tumor, with 5 -FU in a model of human HT29 colore ctal tumor, and with Doxil® in a model of 
human A2780 ovarian tumor.  
 
Brain tumor exposure and anti -tumor activity of NKTR -102 was also evaluated in an 
experimental model of breast cancer brain metastases using brain -seeking MDA -MB-231Br 
breast cancer cel ls.  Preferential accumulation in brain tumor tissue over plasma was observed 
with NKTR -102, but not with irinotecan .  Vehicle - and irinotecan -treated animals showed a

metastases  
 
Protocol Version #4.0  13 19 February 2016  median survival of 21 days, while 50% of NKTR -102-treated animals were still alive 61 da ys 
after treatment initiation, with a censored median survival of 51 days.  
 
The safety of NKTR -102 was evaluated in both single and repeat -dose toxicity studies in rats and 
dogs .  Toxicity studies included a comparator group of irinotecan -treated animals .  In all studies 
conducted, NKTR -102 was better tolerated than equivalent doses of irinotecan .  The maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) of NKTR -102 in toxicology studies was 25 to 50% higher for NKTR -102 
than irinotecan based on irinotecan equivalent dosing .  Direct comparison of NKTR -102 with 
irinotecan at the same doses in a 4 -weekly dose study in dogs showed substantially lower 
neutropenia and gastrointestinal (GI) effects with NKTR -102.  A 3-month toxicity study in the 
dog has demonstrated that a dose of 30 mg /kg of NKTR -102 (600 mg/m2), every two weeks, 
was tolerated without major overt toxicity; the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 
determined to be 6 mg/kg of NKTR -102; the MTD was determined to be ≥ 30 mg/kg of 
NKTR -102. 
 
2.2.2  Clinical pharmacokinetics  
The apparent elimination T½ for SN38 after NKTR -102 for Injection administration is 
approximately 50 days versus approximately 2 days after irinotecan dosing .  This greatly 
increased SN38 T½ from NKTR -102 results in plasma SN38 concentrations that are significantly 
more prolonged between doses than are possible with irinotecan .  After an initial dose of 
NKTR -102 at the recommended Phase 2 dose of 145 mg/m2, plasma SN3 8 AUC is 
approximately the same as with the 350 mg/m2 dose of irinotecan, but maximal concentrations 
are approximately 10 -fold less .  Moreover, plasma SN38 concentrations are sustained throughout 
the q21d dosing interval, compared to lack of SN38 exposure for 70% of the q21d dosing 
interval after an irinotecan dose of 145 mg/m2 .  Eighty percent of steady -state for SN38 
exposure is typically reached after 4 cycles of therapy on the q21d schedule .  Overall, 
NKTR -102 for Injection administration resulted in pr olonged and controlled systemic exposure 
to SN38 .  Pharmacokinetics of NKTR -102 and metabolites are predictable and do not require 
complex dosing adjustments.

As of 18 October  2013, safety data from  786 patients across all clinical studies (completed and 
ongoing; single -agent and combination therapy) have been analyzed and included in the 
Investigator’s Brochure, version 10.  
Observations across all studies (including safety data from ongoing studies) have been generally 
consistent w ith regard to the overall safety profile of etirinotecan pegol .  Gastrointestinal 
toxicity, especially diarrhea, is the most common and clinically significant toxicity occurring 
with the use etirinotecan pegol .  Other frequently observed AEs have been naus ea, vomiting, 
fatigue, and dehydration (secondary to diarrhea and/or vomiting).  
Diarrhea and dehydration were also the most common serious adverse events (SAEs) across all 
studies evaluating etirinotecan pegol .  The incidence of grade 3 diarrhea in the ph ase 2 study in 
patients with MBC at the recommended dose and schedule equaled 23%, with 11% grade  3

metastases  
 
Protocol Version #4.0  14 19 February 2016  dehydration and 6% grade 3 vomiting (there was no grade 4 diarrhea, dehydration or vomiting) .  
Prolonged severe diarrhea with associated dehydration leading  to pre -renal azotemia/kidney 
failure has been fatal in three patients in the ongoing phase 2 studies in metastatic colorectal, 
ovarian, and breast cancers (one each of an ovarian cancer and breast cancer patient on the 
14-day schedule; one CRC patient on the 21 -day schedule) .  Early cholinergic toxicities 
(including diarrhea), commonly associated with irinotecan, has not been observed with the use of 
etirinotecan pegol in any of the completed or ongoing clinical studies .  Late-onset, severe 
diarrhea can oc cur: the median time -to-onset of grade 3 diarrhea for etirinotecan pegol for the 
q21d schedule is 93  days (range 8 to 107  days) .  Early, proactive and aggressive intervention 
with anti -diarrheal therapy, IV hydration, and maintenance of electrolyte balance  was observed 
to have a significant favorable effect on the clinical course of events, as this may prevent volume 
depletion, electrolyte imbalances and the development of kidney failure.  
Myelosuppression, especially neutropenia, can occur in patients rece iving etirinotecan pegol; 
however, data from clinical studies evaluating etirinotecan pegol suggest a lower frequency and 
severity of neutropenia than for irinotecan .  Etirinotecan pegol administered at a dose level of 
145 mg/m² in a q21d schedule overall across all ongoing phase 2 studies showed an overall 
incidence of neutropenia of ≤  20% (all NCI -CTCAE grades) with 11% reported as NCI -CTCAE 
grade 3/4 .  The onset of neutropenia in the concomitant setting of severe diarrhea and 
dehydration with fever and i nfection must be carefully monitored and proactively treated as it 
can potentially lead to neutropenic sepsis, which may be fatal.  
2.2.4  Clinical Efficacy  
A Phase 1 clinical study of single -agent NKTR -102 is completed and was designed to evaluate 
the safe ty, tolerability, and PK of the different treatment schedules of NKTR -102 in patients with 
refractory solid tumors .  The MTD of NKTR -102 was 115 mg/m2 for the wx3 q4wk treatment 
schedule, and 145 mg/m2 for the q21d and q14d treatment schedules.  
 
Efficacy data observed in this completed Phase 1 study showed that NKTR -102 has an 
encouraging level of anti -tumor activity (11%) in a broad spectrum of tumors: eight confirmed 
PRs in patients with triple -negative breast cancer, non -small cell and small cell lung c ancers, 
cervix, colorectal, pancreas, maxillary sinus, and bladder.  
 
A Phase 2a study is also completed and was designed to determine the tolerable dose, safety and 
efficacy of NKTR -102 in combination with cetuximab in patients with refractory solid tumor s.  
When NKTR -102 for Injection was administered in combination with cetuximab, 100 mg/m2 at 
q21d was better tolerated than 125 mg/m2  at q21d.  
 
In addition a Phase 2 study of NKTR -102 in patients with MBC evaluating 2 treatment regimens 
(145 mg/m2 q14d an d q21d; n = 70 patients; 35 patients per treatment regimen) showed 
significant antitumor activity when efficacy data were presented in The Lancet 
Oncology .(Awada, Garcia et al. 2013)  The ORR by RECIST version 1.0 was 28.6% with 2 CR s 
and 18 PRs .  The median PFS was 4.7 months and OS was 10.3 months .  Clinical activity

metastases  
 
Protocol Version #4.0  15 19 February 2016  appeared to be numerically superior in t he 21d schedule, although the trial was not designed to 
compare the 2 treatment arms.  
 
Two Phase 2 clinical studies are evaluating NKTR -102 in colorectal and ovarian cancers .  The 
Phase 2 study in CRC patients is currently ongoing .  In the Phase 2 study o f patients with ovarian 
cancer, efficacy data are presented in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. (Vergote, Garcia et al. 
2013)  The ORR was 20% (20% for the once -every -14-day schedule and 19% for the 
once -every -21-day schedule) .  Median PFS was 4.1 months for every 14 days and 5.3 months for 
every 21 days .  Median OS was 10.0 months for every 14 days and 11.7 months for every 21 
days.  Efficacy data from this study of patients with ovarian cancer are preliminary, sinc e the 
data evaluation is currently ongoing .  See Section 5.3 of the Investigator's Brochure version 10 
for details on antitumor efficacy from Phase 1 and 2 trials investigating NKTR -102.  
 
The NKTR -102 Phase 3 clinical program (BEACON trial) began enrollme nt in December 2011 
and closed enrollment in August 2013 .  This study compares NKTR -102 for Injection 145 
mg/m2 q21d to TPC in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who were 
previously treated with an anthracycline, a taxane, and cape citabine therapy. On 17 March 2015 , 
Nektar Therapeutics announced results of the BEACON study, a trial comparing NKTR -102 to 
Treatment of Physician's Choice ("TPC", any of seven standard of care anticancer drugs) in 
women with advanced breast cancer.   In a topline analysis of 852 patients from the trial, NKTR -
102 provided a 2.1 month improvement in median overall survival (OS) over (12.4 months for 
patients receiving NKTR -102 compared to 10.3 months for patients receiving TPC).   The overall 
comparison of su rvival did not show a statistically significant result comparing the  
NKTR -102 group to the TPC group.   The incidence of severe toxicities was lower in the NKTR -
102 arm (48%) compared to the TPC arm (63%).   Common severe toxicities observed with 
NKTR -102 we re diarrhea (9.6%), low white blood cell counts   (9.4%) which could lead to 
infection, low red blood cell counts (4.7%) which could lead to being tired and fatigue (4.5%).  
Common severe toxicities observed with TPC were low white blood cell counts  
(30.5%) which could lead to infection, low red blood cell counts  
(4.7%) which could lead to being tired, and feeling short of breath (4.4%).  
Severe nerve pain was seen in 3.7% of patients on TPC versus 0.5% of patients in the NKTR -
102 arm.. The full press release can be read on < http://www.nektar.com > www.nektar.com . 
 
This trial was also presented at ASCO 2015 with the abstract verbatim as follows. EP is the first 
long-acting topoisomerase 1 inhibitor providing sustained levels of SN38. In Phase II, EP 
demonstrated a 29% ORR following a median of 2 prior regimens for aBC. BEACON study 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) randomized (1:1) pts with aBC and progressive disease following A,T and C to 
EP (145 mg/m2q3w over 90 minutes) or TPC (any of 7 cytotoxics). Methods: Eligible pts had 
any ER/HER2 and ECOG 0 -1; stable brain metastases were allowed. 852 pts enrolled over 20 
months and reached target for events in Dec2014. The choice of TPC: eribulin 40%, vinorelbine 
23%, gemcitabine 18%, taxane 15%, ixabepilone 4%. Primary efficacy endpoint was overall 
survival (OS) by 2 -sided log -rank test stratified by region, prior eribulin and receptor status; the 
study had 90% power to detect a target Ha zard Ratio (HR) of 0.77. Circulating tumor cells 
(CTCs) were isolated in ~80% of pts and analyzed for target -specific pharmacodynamic 
biomarkers. This is the first presentation of these data. Results: EP provided a 2.1 month 
improvement in median OS over T PC (12.4 vs 10.3 months; HR 0.87, p = 0.08). In a pre -

metastases  
 
Protocol Version #4.0  16 19 February 2016  specified subgroup of 67 pts with brain metastases, EP showed an improvement of 5.2 months in 
median OS (10.0 vs 4.8 months; HR 0.51, p < 0.01); the proportion of pts with brain metastases 
alive at 12 -mo survival was higher with EP (44.4% vs 19.4%). Similarly, in pts with liver 
metastases (n = 456) median OS improved with EP (10.9 vs 8.3 months; HR 0.73, p = 0.002). 
Grade (G) ≥ 3 AEs were lower with EP (48%) than TPC (63%). Common G ≥ 3 AE with EP: 
diarr hea (9.6%), neutropenia (9.6%), anemia (4.7%) and fatigue (4.5%); TPC: neutropenia 
(30.5%), anemia (4.7%) and dyspnea (4.4%). Severe neuropathy: 3.7% of pts (TPC) vs 0.5% 
(EP). Alopecia was less with EP (10% vs 23%). Data on efficacy in CTC biomarker defin ed sub -
groups (TOP1, TOP2) will be presented. Conclusions: EP provided a clinically meaningful 
benefit to pts with late -stage aBC, although this did not reach statistical significance. In pts with 
brain metastases, median OS doubled; improved survival was also seen in other pt subsets. 
Toxicity with EP was less than with TPC. Clinical trial information: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]. (Perez,

for use of etirinotecan pegol in advanced lung cancer and metastatic breast can cer patients with 
brain metastases.   
 
2.3 Rationale  
 
Etirinotecan pegol is a topoisomerase I inhibitor that has demonstrated promising results in 
drug-resistant solid tumors, such as advanced and heavily pre -treated breast and ovarian 
cancers .(Awada, Garcia et al. 2013; Vergote, Garcia et al. 2013)  The active metabolite of 
etirinotecan pegol is SN -38, a drug known to have activity in solid tumors .  Irinotecan, which is 
converted to SN -38, can only be given every 1-3 weeks based on its toxicity profile .  In that 
time, however, serum levels of irinotecan drop to undetectable .  The long -acting delivery 
mechanism of etirinotecan pegol, however, provides sustained levels of SN -38 throughout 
treatment cycles with a n improv ed side effects profile . It is also believed that pegylation may 
allow more drug accumulation in tumors, including brain metastases, creating a higher local 
concentration of chemotherapy.  This makes etirinotecan pegol an attractive agent for study in 
patie nts with advanced tumors  with brain metastases.  
 
2.4 Study Design  
The primary purpose of this protocol is to evaluate the efficacy of etirinotecan pegol as a 
treatment for advanced NSCLC  and SCLC  and locally recurrent or MBC with brain metastases .  
We will  evaluate a single group of 12 patients with NSCLC  (Cohort A) , 3 patients with SCLC  
(Cohort B)  and 12 patients with metastatic b reast cancer  (Cohort C) in this single -arm, 
non-randomized study .  This trial is open; neither investigators nor patients will b e blinded .  It 
will be powered based on an estimated minimal non -treatment disease control rate of 5%, typ e I 
error of 5%, and power of 81 %.  We will consider achiev ing a 33% disease control rate  a 
positive signal.  
 
Primary Endpoint:  
A phase II study of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR -102)  in patients with advanced lung cancer and refractory brain 
metastases  
 
Protocol Version #4.0  17 19 February 2016   For cohort A  and C , to determine the CNS disease control rate (number of patients 
with SD+PR+CR/total number of evaluable  patients) at 12 weeks   
Secondary Endpoints:   
Cohort A  and C :  
• To measure the overall disease control rate and response rate for patients receiving 
study  therapy  
• To measure the systemic (non -CNS) disease control rate and response rate for 
patients receiving study therapy  
• To observe the progression -free survival of the study population  
• To observe the overall survival of the study population  
 
Cohort B:   
 To observe CNS and/or systemic disease control in  SCLC  
 
Cohorts A , B, and C :  
• To determine the safety profile of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR -102) 
 
 
We will recruit 12 eligible patients  with NSCLC  (Cohort A) ,  3 eligible patients with SCLC  
(Cohort B)  and 12 patients with MBC  to the brain (Cohort C) who enroll on study and receive at 
least one dose of study therapy .  All patients will receive etirinotecan pegol  on a 21 -day dosing 
schedule  (cycle) .  Patients will not receive other concurrent chemotherapy .  Patients will be 
follo wed with a clinical exam every  cycle  and body CT  and brain MRI every 2 cycles for the 
first 4 cycles , then consistently through the end of treatment .  Those who have not progressed 
will continu e to receive etirinotecan pegol  until dis ease progression, unacceptable toxicity, 
withdrawal of consent, or investigator 's decision.  
 
We will monitor for toxicity as defined in the CTCAE version 4 .  Adverse reactions attributed to 
etirinotecan pegol will follow dose delay and modifications outlin ed in section 6.1.  
 
The Stanford Cancer Center data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be used to review the 
safety of etirinotecan pegol in the study and to assess interim efficacy data.  
 
2.5 Correlative Studies Background  
 DNA is continually shed into t he circulation by primary or metastatic tumors, and can be 
isolated in the form of cell -free DNA (cfDNA) .  Methods to quantitatively identify rare strands 
of DNA have become much more powerful following the development of next -generation 
sequencing (NGS), which uses massively parallel PCR -based methodologies to quantitatively 
measure the prevalence of a population of DNA molecules.  
 
At Stanford, our collaborator Max Diehn has developed a highly sensitive method to sequence 
tumor DNA in the peripheral blood , termed CAPP -Seq ( CAncer Personalized Profiling by Deep 
Sequencing) .  CAPP -Seq uses targeted hybrid capture to identify genomic “hotspot” alterations 
in a region totaling approximately 125 kB, a relatively small fraction of the entire genome.  
A phase II study of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR -102)  in patients with advanced lung cancer and refractory brain 
metastases  
 
Protocol Version #4.0  18 19 February 2016   Designed specifically to identify mutations in non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 
CAPP -Seq can be applied to peripheral blood plasma as well as paraffin -embedded tumor tissue .  
By sequencing a 
limited portion of the 
entire genome at over 
5000 -fold depth 
producing relatively 
even coverage of the 
targeted regions, 
CAPP -Seq identifies at 
least one mutation in 
>90% of NSCLC 
tumors and detects 
mutant allele 
frequencies down to 
0.025% with a 
negligible technical 
background 
(~0.007%),  allowing 
accurate quantitation of 
circulating tumor 
DNA in early and 
advanced stage 
tumors .  (Figure 2 ) In 
contrast, a recently 
published similar 
technique has a allelic detection frequency of 2 -5% to detect cancer specific mutations and small 
nucleotide variants (SNVs). (Newman, Bratman et al. 2014)  
 Here we propose to apply CAPP -Seq to detect tumor signatures longitudinally over time 
in blood specimens from patients undergoing active treatment for N SCLC .  By interrogating 
hundreds of recurrently mutated genomic regions, CAPP -Seq can identify mutations in the vast 
majority of individual NSCLCs and can thus be directly applied to a broad patient population .  
We have deliberately optimized CAPP -Seq for use on plasma samples collected in routinely 
available EDTA -containing tubes, as opposed to more specialized tubes .  Finally, CAPP -Seq is 
economical at less than  $300 per assay currently  and will be covered by Stanford research funds , 
and per sample costs should drop further as sequencing costs continue to fall.   This will not be 
done for Cohort C

or after radiotherapy.  
 
The treatments listed below are prohibited while on study .  For treatments prohibited on study, 
alternative medical intervention should be considered .  If a prohibited treatment is required, 
study treatment must be discontinued but the patient should continue to be followed for study 
outcomes.  
 Other investigational agents.  
 Any concurrent chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy , or other systemic 
therapy for cancer.  
 Investigators must monitor patients for use of poten t cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) 
inducers or inhibitors, as they may induce or inhibit irinotecan  or SN38 metabolism .  
Some of th ese agents are OTC medications, eg , St John’s  Wort .  Patients must provide a 
complete list of all concomitant medications as part of the screening process.

4.2 Criteria for Removal from Study  
Patients may choose to discontinue the trial at any time, for any reason,  and without prejudice to 
further treatment .  A patient who withdraws consent from study participation will be asked to 
state the level of withdrawal:  
 
1. Withdrawal from treatment only;  in this case follow up and survival data will continue as 
planned.  
 
2. Withdrawal from contact during the post -treatment period ( allowing no collection of  off-study 
data, such as  subsequent anti -cancer therapy, progression if not determined during study 
treatment, and survival)  
 
In the event of withdrawal of c onsent, the st udy staff and/or i nvestigator must make every effort 
to ascertain the level of consent withdrawn .  The type of consent withdrawal must be noted in 
source documents and eCRF.  
 
Patients will stop study drug therapy for any of the following reasons .  These pa tients will be 
followed up for efficacy outcomes until the end of the study .  They must be followed for safety  
until resolution or permanent sequelae of all toxicities attributable to the study drug:  
 Any unacceptable toxicity  
 The patient withdraws consent  for treatment  
A phase II study of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR -102)  in patients with advanced lung cancer and refractory brain 
metastases  
 
Protocol Version #4.0  24 19 February 2016   Investigator's decision, eg , clinical deterioration or not in the patient’s best interests to 
continue in the study  
 Pregnancy  
 The patient is lost to follow -up 
 Death  
 Consistent and significant n on-compliance of the patient with protocol -mandat ed 
procedures  
 The study is terminated by the investigator or Nektar .  If the study is terminated by 
Nektar, patients who are receiving clinical benefit from their participation in this study 
(defined as SD or an objective response without unacceptable toxi city) will continue to 
receive etirinotecan pegol  from Nektar.  
 
Patients may continue on study therapy with permission of the overall study PI  in the following 
situations :  
 
 Patients with p rogression of disease as determined by the investigator  should gene rally 
discontinue study therapy. However, if the patient is having clinical benefit (for example 
response or stable disease in the CNS or systemically, with mild progression in the other 
compartment)  patients may  be considered to  continue on therapy post -progression . The 
patient should have permission from the overall study PI to receive post -progression 
therapy before the second post progression dose is given (i.e. they can receive one post 
progression dose without prospective permission)   
 
 For p atients wh o require > 28 days delay  (starting from the time the next dose was 
supposed to be administered), the post -study treatment period would begin, including 
follow -up for survival, unless, in the investigator’s opinion, continuing in the study is of 
benefit fo r the patient .  In this case, the reason of continuation must be documented  and 
they should have permission from the overall study PI before resuming treatment  
 
If a patient withd raws from study treatment, the i nvestigator must promptly notify the Stanford  
Medical Monitor and will make every effort to complete the End -of-Treatment visit .  Every 
effort must be made to ascertain if patients will permit follow -up for survival.  
 
Before a patient is considered “l ost to follow -up”, study personnel must contact th e patient at 
least twice by phone and once by mail with documented receipt .  Study personnel may use public 
records to check for mortalit y for any patients considered “l ost to follow -up,” if permitted by 
applicable laws or regulations.  
 
4.3 Alternatives  
Patients may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to their further care .  
Patients with progressing advanced lung cancer  or MBC and  brain metastases may be offered a 
variety of alternate treatment  options .  They may also be offered palliativ e and supportive care 
services.

mg of irinotecan .  Each vial and carton will be labeled to comply with local guidelines . 
 
Body surface area (BSA) will be determined before the start of each cycle  using the Mosteller  
formula , based on baseline height and most recent weight .   
 
Dose:  
Each patient’s etirinotecan pegol  dose will be determined by multiplying most recent BSA 
times the starting dose of 145 mg/ m2, with BSA capped at 2.4  m2. 
 
NKTR -102 for Injection will be administered as an IV infusion over 90 minutes (± 15 minutes) .  
Pre-medications should not be administered prior to the initial infusion, but if a patient report s 
symptoms (such as nausea and/or vomiting), prophylactic use of anti -emetics may be attempted.  
 
Etirinotecan pegol  will be initiated and maintained at a dose of 145 mg/ m2 every 21 days unless 
dose delay or modifications are required per guidelines specifi ed in the protocol until progression 
or unacceptable toxicity develops .

6. DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
6.1 Re-treatment Criteria  
Prior to initiation of subsequent cycles, patients must meet requirements with respect to  
hematopoietic function : 
 
Hgb ≥ 8.0 g/dL  
ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L 
platelets ≥ 75 x 109/L.  
 
Diarrhea must be fully resolved to CTCAE grade 0 for at least 7 days without supportive 
antidiarrheal measures prior to re -treatment.  
 
Any treatment -related non -hematologic toxicities must have re solved to baseline or CTCAE 
grade 1  except for non -clinically significant toxicities, such as electrolyte abnormalities in the 
absence of diarrhea .  
 
Supportive care may be implemented in order to ameliorate diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, 
or myelosu ppression.  
 
A phase II study of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR -102)  in patients with advanced lung cancer and refractory brain 
metastases  
 
Protocol Version #4.0  27 19 February 2016  Dose reductions may also be implemented for patients who experience recurrent or specific 
severe toxicities .  See table 6.1.  
 
6.2 Treatment D elay due to Drug Related Toxicity  
All AEs will be asse ssed according to CTCAE version 4.0 .  In the eve nt of multiple toxicities, 
dose delays and modifications should occur in  accordance with the worst toxicity observed .  If 
the patient fails to meet the criteria for re -treatment (s ection  6.1 above) , treatment may be 
delayed, followed by an additional evalu ation to determine feasibility of re -treatment .  Initiation 
of subsequent doses may be delayed for a maximum of 28 days to allow recovery from any 
toxicity to permit re -treatment (with the delay calculated from the scheduled date of the next 
infusion) .  Patients whose treatment delays are  ≥14 days but  ≤28 days due to a drug -related  
toxicity should initiate their next treatment cycle with a dose reduction (see Sections 6.2 + 6.3) .  
For example: if a patient receives therapy on March 1, the next cycle should be initiated on 
March 22); the patient would receive a dose reduction if the dose is delayed such that it occurs 
between April 5 - 18.  Patients who require > 28 days delay due to unresolved toxicity must be 
withdrawn from treatment  (the post -study treatme nt period would begin, including follow -up for 
survival), unless, in the investigator’s opinion, continuing in the study is of benefit for the 
patient .  In this case, the reason of continuation must be documented.  
 
 
6.3  Dose Modifications for Drug Related  Toxicity  
Dose escalation for etirinotecan pegol  is not permitted .  Patients who undergo dose reduction of  
etirinotecan pegol  due to observed toxicity may not be re -escalated to the previous dose level 
upon  resolution of the toxicity.  
 
Etirinotecan pegol  dose modifications (reductions or delays) must be recorded for each patient in 
the appropriate section of the eCRF.  
 
Dose levels:  
Etirinotecan pegol  doses for an individual patient may be reduced to :  
 
Dose level -1:    120 mg/ m2 
 
Dose level -2:    95 mg/ m2  
 
Only two dose reductions are permitted .  Patients will be off study if toxicity requires a dose 
reduction beyond the 2 dose reduction steps .  Dose reductions and holds should generally follow 
the recommendations below , but dose reduction or dose holds can be for lower grade or other 
toxicities, or dose reductions or holds can be omitted, at investigator discretion if believed to be 
in the best interest of the patient.

6.4  Antidiarrheal Therapy  
Patients receiving  to NKTR -102 ma y experience diarrhea.   Diarrhea must be treated promptly 
with loperamide.   It is recommended that  patients have loperamide from Cycle  1 Day 1 and 
throughout the study for their use at home.    
Patients with diarrhea must be carefully monitored, given adequ ate fluid and electrolyte 
replacement if they become dehydrated, and given antibiotic support if they develop ileus, fever, 
or severe neutropenia.    
Early onset diarrhea (occurring during or shortly after infusion of study drug) has occasionally 
been seen with NKTR -102 as a cholinergic manifestation.   It is usually transient and is only 
infrequently severe.   It may be accompanied by symptoms of blurred vision, blepharospasm, 
miosis, lacrimation, muscle twitching, and/or intestinal hyperperistalsis that can cause abdominal 
cramping.   If necessary, early diarrhea and other cholinergic symptoms may be ameliorated by 
administration of atropine (0.25 to 1 mg subcutaneous or IV).   However, few patients 
required  atropine in the BEACON study, and the nature of the c holinergic toxicities usually does 
not warrant the prophylactic use of atropine.    
Late onset diarrhea (occurring more than 24 hours after the infusion) can be life -threatening, 
because it may be prolonged and may lead to dehydration, hypotension, and rena l failure.   In the 
BEACON study, 9.6% of patients reported Grade 3 diarrhea.   Among those patients, the median 
A phase II study of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR -102)  in patients with advanced lung cancer and refractory brain 
metastases  
 
Protocol Version #4.0  32 19 February 2016  time to onset of Grade 2 diarrhea was 40 days, and the median onset for Grade 3 diarrhea was 
43 days.   In addition, the median time to resolution  of Grade ≤ 2 diarrhea was 1.5 days and the 
median time to resolution of Grade 3 diarrhea was 6 days.   There were no incidents of Grade 4 
diarrhea.    
Patients must be assessed prior to dosing to ascertain whether they have had diarrhea since the 
last dose of NKTR -102, whether they are currently receiving anti -diarrheal supportive care, and 
what was the date of the last episode of diarrhea/loose stool.   A patient must be without 
symptoms of diarrhea and without anti -diarrheal supportive care for at least 7 d ays prior to the 
next dose of NKTR -102.   
Diarrhea Prophylaxis  
In the absence of constipation, the physician may recommend to initiate prophylactic use of 
loperamide starting with Cycle 2 to mitigate the risk for late onset diarrhea.   The recommended 
loper amide dosage regimen is 2 mg every 24 hours (q24h) starting after the Cycle 2 dose and 
continuing for 7  days.   The 7 -day prophylactic regimen is repeated with each subsequent cycle 
starting after the dose until Cycle 6.   In the absence of constipation, the  recommended 
loperamide regimen is 2 mg every 8 to 12 hours (q8 -12h) starting after the Cycle 6 dose and 
continuing for 7 days.   The 7 -day prophylactic regimen is repeated after the dose in each 
subsequent cycle.    
Diarrhea Treatment  
Each patient will be i nstructed to begin loperamide for diarrhea at the first episode of poorly -
formed or loose stool, or at the earliest onset of bowel movements that are more frequent than 
normally expected for the patient.    
The recommended dosage regimen for loperamide is 4  mg at the first onset of late diarrhea and 
then 2 mg every 2 hours until the patient is diarrhea -free for at least 12 hours.   This dosage 
regimen exceeds the usual dosage recommendations for loperamide; it is not recommended to be 
used at this high dosage  for more than 48 consecutive hours, due to the risk of paralytic 
ileus.   During the night, the patient may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours.    
The use of drugs with laxative properties should be avoided due to the potential for exacerbation 
of diarrh ea.  Patients should contact their physician to discuss any laxative use.    
Patients must be instructed to  contact their physician or nurse if any of the following occur: 
diarrhea at any time during study drug treatment; black or bloody stools; symptoms of  
dehydration such as lightheadedness, dizziness, or faintness; inability to take fluids by mouth due 
to nausea or vomiting; inability to control diarrhea within 24 hours; fever or evidence of 
infection.    
A phase II study of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR -102)  in patients with advanced lung cancer and refractory brain 
metastases  
 
Protocol Version #4.0  33 19 February 2016  Investigators should contact the Medical Monitor to  review diarrheal supportive care instructions 
for patients whose diarrhea has been documented to be due to a cause other than NKTR -102 (eg, 
positive stool test for C. difficile ).   
 
6.5  Anti emetic Therapy  
If a patient experiences nausea and/or vomiting, the patient may be given prophylactic  antiemetic 
treatment prior to the next dose of etirinotecan pegol .  The patient must be carefully  monito red 
throughout the study period  and given adequate fluid and electrolyte replacement to prevent 
dehydration and el ectrolyte imbalance.  
 
6.6  Use of Growth Factor Support and Transfusions  
Upon etirinotecan pegol  administration, patients may experience neutropenia, though its severity  
appears to be less than seen with Camptosar® (irinotecan) administration .  It may be  
accompanied by gastrointestinal toxicities, such as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, c onstipation and 
abdominal pain/ cramping.  
 
Patients who do not meet retreatment criteria for ANC should return to clinic within 1-7 days for 
reassessment .  If the patient conti nues not to meet retreatment criteria for ANC, the patient  
should return to clinic at weekly intervals for reassessment .  Patients must demonstrate an ANC 
≥ 1.5 x 109/L prior to re -treatment with etirinotecan pegol . 
 
Prophylactic use of growth factor support is not permitted, however use of growth factor support 
in a setting of neutropenia is permitted .  Use of growth factor support must follow American 
Society Clinical Oncology (ASCO), ESMO guidelines , or standard of care at Stanford.  
 
Patients may receive transfusions (plate lets or blood products) at the i nvestigator’s discretion .  A 
patient who has a re -treatment value of Hgb  < 8.0 g/dL or platelets < 75 x 109/L may receive a 
transfusion;  however , patients must meet retreatment criteria prior to retreatment.  
 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING PROCEDURES  
7.1 Potential Adverse Events  
Observations across all studies (including safety data from ongoing studies p resented below as of 
18 October 2013, which are preliminary) have been generally consistent with regard to the safety 
profile of NKTR -102.  Gastrointestinal toxicity, especially diarrhea, continues to be the most 
common and clinically significant toxicity occurring with the use of NKTR -102.  Other 
frequently observed AEs include nausea, fatigue, vomiting, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, 
constipation, and dehydration .  Dehydration has usually been secondary to GI toxicities such as 
diarrhea and/or vomiti ng. 
 
Diarrhea and dehydration (secondary to diarrhea) were also the most common serious adverse 
events (SAEs) reported across all studies evaluating NKTR -102 (occurring at a frequency of 
9.4% and 4.1%, respectively) .  Prolonged severe diarrhea with dehydra tion leading to pre -renal 
azotemia and subsequent acute renal insufficiency has been fatal in three patients in the ongoing 
A phase II study of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR -102)  in patients with advanced lung cancer and refractory brain 
metastases  
 
Protocol Version #4.0  34 19 February 2016  Phase 2 studies in metastatic colorectal, ovarian, and breast cancers (one patient in each study) .  
Although early onset cholinergic  diarrhea is reported with the use of irinotecan and patients can 
receive atropine as a premedication to prevent this, atropine as a premedication is not 
recommended prior to NKTR -102 for Injection administration, as this toxicity has been only 
rarely repo rted in patients who received NKTR -102. 
 
Severe diarrhea can occur without any evidence of significant GI toxicity observed in preceding 
courses of treatment with NKTR -102.  Exposure to SN38, the active metabolite of NKTR -102, is 
a function of dose, schedu le, and each patient’s capacity to metabolize and eliminate NKTR -102 
and SN38 .  Given the extended T½ of SN38 derived from NKTR -102 (approximately 50 days), 
late onset diarrhea may occur and can be life -threatening if treatment is delayed .  Early, 
proactiv e, and aggressive intervention with anti -diarrheal therapy, IV hydration, and 
maintenance of electrolyte balance is essential to prevent volume depletion, electrolyte 
imbalances, and the development of kidney failure.  
 
Myelosuppression, especially neutrope nia, can occur in patients receiving NKTR -102.  
Neutropenia in the setting of dehydration and unresolving GI toxicities may lead to the 
development of life -threatening or fatal sepsis .  To date across all clinical studies, three patients 
have died within 3 0 days from last dose of NKTR -102 due to potentially drug -related 
neutropenic sepsis or complications of neutropenic sepsis, such as septic shock.  
 
Prior to retreatment, patients must meet minimal requirements with respect to hematopoietic 
function especia lly neutrophil count with an ANC of ≥ 1.5 X 109/L .  Please refer to each specific 
protocol for retreatment requirements for other hematological toxicities.  
 
Except for diarrhea (which must completely resolve prior to retreatment), all Grade 3 or higher 
toxicities must resolve to baseline or Grade 1 severity prior to retreatment .  Supportive care may 
be implemented in order to ameliorate diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or 
myelosuppression .  Dose reductions must also be implemented for patients who expe rience 
recurrent or specific severe toxicities as defined by the dose modification guidelines included in 
each protocol .  Refer to Section 6.6 for more detailed guidance regarding management of 
NKTR -102 related hematological toxicities especially neutropen ia. 
Hypersensitivity or mild allergic reactions characterized by itching, swollen tongue, flushing, 
dizziness, muscle twitching, and/or temporary speech impairment have been observed in some 
patients .  In those patients who experienced muscle twitching, th e majority of cases occurred on 
the day of infusion and were self -limited in nature .  In most cases, symptoms were mild in 
severity and management with antihistamines and/or steroids led to successful resolution of these 
events .  In many patients, NKTR -102 rechallenge has been successful in subsequent cycles of 
therapy following premedication with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids.  
 
7.1.1  Adverse Event Definition and Assessment  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investig ation subject  
administered a pharmaceutical product, at any dose, not necessarily related to the treatment .  An 
AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product .  An AE can also arise from any use of the drug and from any route of 
A phase II study of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR -102)  in patients with advanced lung cancer and refractory brain 
metastases  
 
Protocol Version #4.0  35 19 February 2016  administration, formulation, or dose .  This definition includes intercurrent illnesses or injuries, 
and exacerbation of preexisting con ditions .  Clinical laboratory abnormalities will only be 
reported as AEs if they are deemed clinically significant by the Investigator and/or are associated 
with signs and symptoms, require intervention or treatment, or require follow -up. 
 
For patients rec eiving NKTR -102 for Injection, an unexpected AE is one  of a type not consistent 
in nature or severity with information in the current Investigator’s  Brochure for etirinotecan 
pegol . 
 
An AE does not include:  
 A medical or surgical procedure, eg , surgery, end oscopy, tooth extraction, or  
transfusion ; an AE is the underlying condition that leads to the procedure  
 Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected before start of study medication 
administration and which do not worsen or increase in severity or frequency after the 
administration of study medication  
 Situations where an untoward medic al occurrence has not occurred, eg , hospitalization 
for elective surgery for a condition that has not worsened on study, social and/or 
convenience admissions to gra nt families a respite in caring for a patient  
 Overdose of either study medication or concomitant medication without any signs or 
symptoms unless the patient is hospitalized for observation  
 
7.1.2  Serious Adverse Event Definition  
An adverse event will be c lassified as an SAE if it meets one of the following criteria:  
Fatal:  AE resulted in death.  
Life threatening:  The AE’s placed the patient at immediate risk of death .  This 
classification does not apply to an AE that hypothetically might 
cause death if it were more severe.  
Hospitalization:  AE that required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization .  
Hospitalizations for elective medical or surgical procedures or 
treatments planned before enrollment in the treatment plan or 
routine check -ups are not SAE's by t his criterion .  Admission to a 
palliative unit or hospice care facility is not considered to be a 
hospitalization.  
Disabling/incapacitating  AE resulted in substantial and permanent disruption of the patient’s 
ability to carry out normal life functions.  
Congenital anomaly or 
birth defect:  An adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a patient exposed to the 
treatment regimen before conception or during pregnancy.  
Medically significant:  The AE did not meet any of the above criteria, but could have 
jeopardized  the patient and might have required medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
 
7.1.3  Adverse Event Attribution  
A phase II study of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR -102)  in patients with advanced lung cancer and refractory brain 
metastases  
 
Protocol Version #4.0  36 19 February 2016  The investigator will evaluate the relationship of each AE to study treatment using the following 
criteria : 
Fatal:  AE resulted in death.  
Unrelated:  Another cause of the AE is more plausible, a temporal sequence 
cannot be established with the onset of the AE and administration 
of the treatment, or a causal relationship is considered biologically 
implausible.  
Possibly Related:  There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the 
AE and administration of treatment, but the AE could also be 
attributed to concurrent or underlying disease, or the use of other 
drugs or procedures .  Possibly related sho uld be used when 
treatment is one of several biologically plausible AE causes.  
Definitely Related:  The AE is clearly related to use of the treatment.  
 
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE v4.0 .  Both Serious and No n-Serious 
Adverse Events will be clearly noted in source documentation and listed on study spec ific Case 
Report Forms (CRFs) .  The Protocol Director or designee will assess each Adverse Event (AE) 
to determine whether it is unexpected according to the Inve stigator’s Brochure, and related to the 
investigation .  All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be tracked until resolution, or until 30 
days after the last dose of the study treatment.  
 
SAEs CTCAE g rade 3 and above, and all subsequent follow -up reports , will be reported to the 
Stanford Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) using the study 
specific CRF regardless of the event’s relatedness to the investigation .  Following review by the 
DSMC, events meeting the IRB definition of "unant icipated problem"  will be reported to the 
IRB using eProtocol within 10 working days of DSMC review, or within 5 working days for 
deaths or life -threatening experiences.  
 
It is the i nvestigator's responsibility to report adverse events to the FDA promptly under the 
terms of the Protocol and in compliance with applicable law .  To insure that Nektar is aware of 
relevant safety data, reports of all “life -threatening adverse events and life -threatening suspected 
adverse reactions,” "serious adverse events and s erious suspected adverse reactions” and 
“unexpected adverse events and unexpected suspected adverse reactions” (as such terms are 
defined in 21 CFR 312.32) (whether initial or follow -up) shall be faxed, within twenty -four (24) 
hours of first knowledge of t he investigator, to the following (or to such other fax number of 
which Nektar  shall notify Stanford and the i nvestigator in writing), with a confirmation copy sent

8. CORRELATIVE/SP ECIAL STUDIES  
We will collect samples for correlative analysis of circulating free tumor DNA on individual 
patients  in all cohorts  as outlined above in the correlative studies background .  Up to three  
10-mL tubes containing sodium -EDTA will be drawn perio dically as indicated in the study 
calendar, below.  
 
Within 2 hours of draw, they should be taken to the laboratory of Max Diehn by the study 
coordinator, or delegate, for centrifugation to separate blood cells from plasma, and freezing into 
aliquots at -80 degrees C  
 
They will be processed at the end of the study and the total amount of  tumor -related  circulating 
tumor DNA will be assessed as a potential surrogate for response to treatment.

10.1  Primary and Secondary Outcome measures  
10.1.1  Relevant Subset  
 
Cohorts A , B and C  will be analyzed separately.  
  
10.1.2 Tumor Measurements  and Response Criteria  
 
Anti -Tumor Effect  
 
Imaging will be obtained at baseline throughout treatment  for both systemic disease and CNS 
disease .  
 
10.1. 2.1 Measurement of Systemic Disease:  
 
Systemic tumor responses will be assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
Guideline (RECIST v1.1) (Eisenhauer, Therasse et al. 2009)  For convenience, these criteria are 
outlined below.  
 
Measurable:  
 Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest 
diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
o Body organ lesions: 10 mm by CT, MRI or PET scan (slice thickness no 
greater than 5 mm)   
o 10 mm cali per measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be 
A phase II study of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR -102)  in patients with advanced lung cancer and refractory brain 
metastases  
 
Protocol Version #4.0  41 19 February 2016  accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable)  
o 20 mm by chest X -ray 
 Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measura ble, a lymph node must be ≥15mm in short axis when assessed by CT, 
MRI or PET scan (slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm) .  At 
baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable:  
 All other lesio ns, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10mm --except for 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15mm short axis) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions .  Lesions considered truly non -measurable include: 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or  pericardial effusion, inflammatory 
breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not 
measurable by reproducible imaging  
 
Measurement of lesions:  
All measurements shou ld be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically 
assessed .  All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the 
treatment start  
 
Method of assessment:  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  Imaging -based 
evaluation should always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) 
being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they 
are superficial and ≥ 10mm diameter as assessed using calipers ( eg, skin nodules) .  
For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography including a 
ruler to estima te the size of the lesion is suggested .  As noted above, when lesions 
can be evaluated by both clinical exam and imaging, imaging evaluation should 
be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of 
the study.  
 Chest X -ray: Ches t CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when 
progression is an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, 
particularly in identifying new lesions .  However, lesions on chest X -ray may be 
considered measurable if they are clearly de fined and surrounded by aerated lung.  
 CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure 
lesions selected for response assessment .  This guideline has defined 
measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice 
thickness is 5mm or less.  
 Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not 
be used as a method of measurement.  
 Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.   
 Tumor markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor 
A phase II study of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR -102)  in patients with advanced lung cancer and refractory brain 
metastases  
 
Protocol Version #4.0  42 19 February 2016  response .  If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they 
must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete response.  
 Cytology, histology: These te chniques can be used to differentiate between PR 
and CR in rare cases if required by protocol.  
 
Tumor Response Evaluation  
 
Baseline documentation of ‘target’ and ‘non -target’ lesions  
 When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions u p to a 
maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ ) 
representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be 
recorded and measured at baseline.  
 Target lesions should be selected on the basis of thei r size (lesions with the longest 
diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those 
that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  
 A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal l esions) 
for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters .  If 
lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is 
added into the sum .  The baseline sum diameters will be used as referen ce to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the 
disease.  
 
Systemic Response Criteria  
 
Complete Response (CR) requires ALL of the following:  
 Disappearance of all target and non -target lesions  
 All pathological ly mph nodes, whether target or non -target, must have reduction in short 
axis to < 10 mm.  
 No new lesion  
 
Partial Response (PR) requires ALL of the following:  
 At least 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline su m of diameters.  
 No unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions  
 No new lesion  
 
Progression of Disease (PD) requires ANY of the following:  
 At least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum on stu dy (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study) .  In 
addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm.  
 Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions  
 Appearance of on e or more new lesions  
 
Stable Disease (SD) requires ALL of the following:  
 Not CR  
A phase II study of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR -102)  in patients with advanced lung cancer and refractory brain 
metastases  
 
Protocol Version #4.0  43 19 February 2016   Not PR  
 Not PD  
 
 
10.1.2.2  Measurement of CNS Disease:   
 
CNS tumor responses will be assessed by the specific criteria outlined below.  
 
 Must be measured by MRI with contrast (u nless contrast is contraindicated  and lesions 
are clearly delineated ) with a slice thickness of 1.5 mm  or thinner (unless permission is given 
from the PI for another slice thickness to be acceptable  – in general the size of the measurable 
lesion should be at least two times the slice thickness with 0 mm skip ). 
  
 Measurable  disease will be defined  as:  
 At least one CNS tumor measuring 10 mm or greater in longest diameter,  
-OR-  
 At least one CNS tumor measuring 5 -9 mm in longest diameter, plus one or two 
additional CNS tumors measuring 3 mm or greater in longest diameter, for which 
the sum of the longest diameters of all lesions is equal to or greater than 10 mm.  
 
These lesions should be  previously untreated (not counting systemic therapy), or progressed 
following previous radiation treatment.  Lesions that have progressed after prior radiation or 
radiosurgery should not be selected if they are suspected of being radionecrosis.  
 
 Non-measurable  disease will be defined as :  
 Brain lesions smaller than  those abo ve.  
 Edema, midline shift, or other secondary process  
 In general, tumor around a cyst or surgical cavity should be considered non -
measurable unless there is a nodular component at least 5 mm in longest diameter.  
 Lesions that cannot be reproducibly measure d 
 Bony sk ull metastases  
 Dural metastases  (these may be measurable as systemic disease)  
 Cystic -only lesions  
 Leptomeningeal disease  
 
Baseline documentation of Target and Non -Target Lesions in the CNS:  
 
For CNS target lesions, each lesion should be measured i n mm. Lesions should be classified as 
measurable or non -measurable (as above) and up to 5 most reproducibly measurable lesions 
selected as target lesions. If lesions not previously treated with local therapies are present, these 
are preferred for selection  as target lesions. A sum of the diameters for all target lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum of longest diameters (sum LD). All other CNS 
lesions should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. They 
may be recorded as a group. Measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed 
as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or ‘unequivocal progression’. Documentation of how each lesion or group 
of lesions was previously treated is recommended ( stereotacti c radiosurgery (SRS), whole brain

CNS Response Criteria:  
 
Evaluation of Target Lesions:  
Complete Response (CR) requires ALL of the following:  
 Disappearance of all CNS target lesions, sustained for at least 4  weeks  
 No new lesion  
 Patient must be off corticosteroids or on physiologic replacement doses only  
 Stable or improved clinically.  
 
Partial Response (PR) requires ALL of the following:  
 At least 30% decrease, compared with baseline, in the sum LD of CNS target enhancing 
lesions , sustained for at least 4 weeks . Note that any lesion <10 mm in LD should be 
regarded as unchanged from baseline unless there is at least a 3 mm change in the 
measured LD . 
 No new lesion  
 Stable to decreased corticosteroid dose  
 Stable or  improved clinically  
 
Progression of Disease (PD) requires ANY of the following:  
 At least 20% increase in the sum of the longest  diameters of all target  enhancing lesions 
(compared with baseline if no decrease) on stable or increasing doses of corticostero ids. 
Note that any lesion <10 mm in LD should be regarded as unchanged from baseline 
unless there is at least a 3 mm change in the measured LD . 
 A significant increase in T2/FLAIR nonenhancing lesions on stable or increasing doses of 
corticosteroids compare d with baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy, 
not due to comorbid events  
 Appearance of one or more new lesions  
 Unequivocal progression of nonmeasurable /nontarget  lesions  
 Definite clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the tumor, or to 
decrease in corticosteroid dose.

10.1. 3 Overall Response Criteria  
 
The least favorable  response from the CNS and systemic measurements  will be chosen as the 
overall response score  if they are unequal (from favorable to unfavorable CR > PR > SD > PD), 
if one site is non -evaluable (NE) then the response score from the other site may be used rather 
than scoring overall response NE .  
 
Failur e to return for evaluation as a result of deteriorating condition may be considered clinical 
overall progression.

will be developed using the  OnCore  database system and will be maintained by study personnel .  
The database will be secured with passwords, only accessible to the research team.  
 
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1 Statistical Design  
This is a single -stage phase II design with CNS disease control rate at 12 weeks as the primary 
endpoint .  For cohort A  and C , 12 patients will be enrolled .  If 3 or more patients with either 
NSCLC  or MBC  have controlled disease (SD, PR, or CR) in the CNS at 12 weeks, we will be 
able to reject the null hypothesis that the disease control rate is not larger than 5%, assuming a 
one-sided significance level of 5% .  The sample size and cutoff provide 81% power with an 
effective alpha level of 2% (one -sided) .  This calculation is based on binomial probabilities , 
assuming an alternative of 33% . 
 
For cohort B, up to 3  patients with SCLC will be enrolled .  They will be observed for CNS and 
systemic disease response as an exploratory group.  
 
12.1.1  Randomization  
There is no randomization for this single -arm phase II study.  
 
12.2 Interim analyses  
There is no stopping rule and no interim analysis.  
 
12.3 Descriptive Statistics and Exploratory Data Anal ysis 
Not applicable  
 
12.4 Primary Analysis   
 
12.4.1  Analysis Population  
All participants will be included in data analysis in an intention -to-treat manner.  
The safety population: All patients who are randomized and receive at least one dose (or partial 
dose) of s tudy drug etirinotecan pegol .  Safety analyses will be conducted based on this 
population.  
 
12.4.2.  Analysis Plan  
The data will be analyzed at least 6 months following the achievement of the primary endpoint 
(CNS disease control ) of the last patient enrolled into this study.  
 
Disease control rate is defined as the number of patients with CNS SD+PR+CR divided by the 
total number of evaluable patients .  The proportion, its 95% confidence interval using the Exact 
method, and p -value of rejection the null hypothesis (5 %) will be summarized.  
 
Patient demographic and clinical characteristics will be described using the appropriate summary

12.5 Secondary Analysis  
 
12.5.1  Analysis Population  
The outcomes will be measured on all  enrolled patients  in an intention -to-treat manner .  
Additionally, we may evaluate selected outcomes on the subset of enrolled patients that receive 
any dose or partial dose of study treatment, and also the Efficacy Evaluable patients (those that 
receive at least 1 cycle of therapy and have relevant imaging performed at or subsequent to the 6 
week timepoint.)  
 
The safety population: All patients who are randomized and receive at least one dose (or partial 
dose) of study drug etirinotecan pegol .  Safety ana lyses will be conducted based on this 
population.  
 
12.5.2  Analysis Plan  
Time to event data (progression -free survival, overall survival) will be described using 
Kaplan -Meier esti mates .  The PFS probability at 12  weeks will be estimated with an 80% power 
and 95% confidence intervals (80% in accord with the planned alpha level, 95% for 
comparability with other studies, confidence intervals based on the Grenwood formula for the 
variance of a survival probability).  
 
Toxicity will be tabulated by organ system and grade.   
 
12.6  Sample Size  
12.6.1 Accrual estimates    
We estimate that we will enroll 6 eligible and evaluable NSCLC patients , 6 eligible and 
evaluable patients with locally recurrent or MBC ) and 1 or 2 SCLC patients per 12 -month  
period, for a total o f 12 NSCLC patients and 3 SCLC patients over 24 months .  In additi on, there 
are few trials within n orthern California competing for accrual in the population of patients with 
advanced lung cancer or advanced breast cancer with brain metastases.  
 
12.6.2 Sam ple size justification  
The null hypothesis: etirinotecan pegol will have no effect on the disease control rate at 12  weeks 
for patients with advanced lung cancer with brain metastases.  
 
The alternate hypothesis: etirinotecan pegol will have a significant e ffect on the disease control 
rate at 12  weeks for patients with advanced lung cancer with brain metastases.  
 
This study has 81 % power to rejec t a 5% disease control rate at 12 weeks with an effective alpha 
level of 2% (one -sided)  if the true disease contr ol rate is 33% or more.  
 
12.6.3 Effect size justification  
This is a single arm, non -randomized, phase II trial of etirinotecan pegol in patients with 
advanced lung cancer with brain metastases .  The disease control rate of 33% is estimated based

metastases  
 
Protocol Version #4.0  48 19 February 2016  on prior studies involving etirinotecan pegol in other cancers .  The null hypothesis reflects the 
opinion that a disease control rate of 5% is not of clinical interest.  
 
12.7 Criteria for future studies  
A statistically significant result as described above would be  a minimal criterion .  An observed 
disease control rate of 33% would be very encouraging and would motivate proceeding to a 
larger, phase III trial.

Title of Study: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double -Blind, Parallel -Group  Study Evaluating the Long- Term Safety, 
Tolerability, and Efficacy of Sub cutaneous Admini stration of TEV -48125 for the Preventive Treatment of Migraine  
Sponsor:  Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc.  
IND Number:  106,533 EudraCT Number:  2015- 004550- 18 
Name of Active Ingredient : Humanized anti-calcitonin gene -related peptide ( CGRP ) monoc lonal antibody  
Name of In vestigational Product : TEV -48125  
Phase of Clinical Development:  3 
Number of Investigational Centers Planned:  Approximately  140 
Countries Planned:  Approximately  15 
Planned Study Period : 1Q/2016 (first patient in) to 2Q /2018 (last patient last visit)   
Number of Patients Planned: A total of 1842 patients, including approximately 867 patients with chronic migraine 
(CM) and 675 patients with  episodic migraine  (EM) from the pivotal efficacy studie s (Stud ies TV48125- CNS -30049 
and TV 48125-C NS-30050, respectively ) and approximately 300 patients (approximately half of whom have a 
diagnosis of CM and half of whom have a diagnosis of EM) who have not participated  in the pivotal efficacy 
studie s, are eligible for enrollment in this study. A 30% d rop-out rate is anticipated.   
Study Population: The study population will be composed of 3 subgroups of patients as follows:  
• Patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies  
• Patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies (new patients)  
• Patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies for antidrug antibody (ADA) evaluation only  
Female and male patients must  be 18 to 70 years of age (inclusive) at the time of screening with a history of 
migraine (as defined by International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd revision [ICHD -3] criteria 
[Classification Committee of the IH S, 2013]) or clinical judgement suggests a migraine diagnosis for at  least 
12 months prior to screening and  a diagnosis of  CM or EM.  For new patients, the diagnosis will be prospectively 
documented via review of headache data recorded daily in an electronic headache diary device during a 28 -day run -
in period.  
New patients (not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies)  will be allowed to remain on up to 2 concomitant 
preventive medication s for migraine , provided that they are on stable dose s for at least 2  months of consecutive use 
prior to study entry. Similarly, patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies using conco mitant preventive 
medications (up to 30% of the patients in the pivotal efficacy studies may be using no more than 1 preventive 
medication  for migraine) will be allowed  to continue taking the  medication during this study.  Those not using 
preventive medicat ions for migraine will be asked not to initiate  preventive medications de novo during the safety 
extension study.  Medications in  scope as concomitant preventive medications are those with at least moderate 
evidence of efficacy for migraine ( Silberstein et al 2012 ). A list of preventive medications is pr esented in  
Appendix  A.  
Patients on acceptable concomitant preventive migraine medication(s) at study entry will be enc ouraged to continue 
their preventive medication regimen without change for the duration of the study. If di scontinuation is clinically

General Design and Methodology:  This is an approximately 19- month,  multicenter, randomized, double -blind , 
parallel -group  study to evaluat e the long-term safety, tolerability , and efficacy of  sc TEV -48125 in adult patients 
with migraine.   
Female and male patients with CM and EM who complete the pivotal efficacy studies (Studies  TV48125- CNS -30049 and TV48125- CNS -30050) and approximately 300 patients (approx imately half of 
whom have a diagnosis of CM and half of whom have a diagnosis of EM) who have not participated in the pivotal 
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01  Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 12  efficacy studies may enter this long -term safety , tolerability,  and efficacy study if they meet the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria a nd provide informed consent. In addition, patients who do not complete the pivotal efficacy studies and 
those patients who complete the pivotal efficacy studies but do not wish to continue treatment during this long -term 
safety , tolerability,  and efficacy study may attend a follow -up visit during this study for the purpose of ADA 
assessment approximately 7.5  months after their last dose of study drug.   
Participation in this study for new patients (ie, patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies) will begin at 
visit 1 (screening), and those who are eligible will complete a 28- day run- in period before returning to the study center 
at visit 2 (day 0) for randomization and baseline assessments. Participation in this study for patients  who rollove r from 
the pivotal efficacy studies  will begin at visit 2. For patients who begin this study on the same day as the  end-of-
treatment  (EOT ) visit for the pivotal efficacy studies, EOT visit procedures /assessments must be  completed before 
beginning  visit 2  procedures /assessments . Baseline for patients who rollover from the pi votal efficacy studies refers to 
the 28 -day run- in period (for headache variables) and visit 2 (day 0) of the pivotal efficacy studies .  
Patients randomized to the active treatment groups  in the pivotal efficacy studies who continue receiving study drug in 
the current study will receive the same treatment throughout the  current  study. Thus, patients with CM who received a 
loading dose of  TEV -48125 at 675 mg followed by monthly  sc TEV -48125 at 225 mg and patients with EM who 
received monthly sc TEV -48125 at 225 mg will continue receiving monthly sc TEV -48125 at 225 mg , and patients 
with CM  or EM who received sc TEV -48125 at 675 mg once in 3 months  will continue receiving  quarterly sc TEV -
48125 at 675 mg . 
Patients with CM randomized to the placebo treatment group  in the pivotal efficacy study who continue receiving study 
drug in the current study and patients with CM who are not rolling over f rom the pivotal efficacy study  will be 
randomized at visit 2 in a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 of 2  treatments: 
• sc TEV -48125 at 675 mg (loading dose) followed by 11 monthly sc doses of TEV -48125 at 225 mg 
• sc TEV -48125 at 675 mg once every 3 months for 12 months  for a total of 4 doses  
Patients with EM randomized to the placebo treatment group in the pivotal efficacy study  who continue receiving study 
drug in the current study  and patients with EM who are not rolling over from the pivotal e fficacy study will be 
randomized  at visit 2 in a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 of 2  treatments: 
• monthly sc TEV -48125 at 225 mg for 12 months  
• sc TEV -48125 at 675 mg once every 3 months for 12 months for a total of 4 doses  
(Note: For this study and the pivotal efficacy studies, monthly dosing refers to do sing approximately every 4 weeks 
[28 days] .) 
First treatment administration will occur at visit 2, and additional doses will be administered at  each visit 
(approximately every 4 weeks ) through visit 13. Patients will return for the EOT  visit (visit 14)  approximately  4 weeks 
after administra tion of the final dose  of study drug, and they will return approximately 7.5 months  (225 days [the 
approximate equivalent of 5 half -lives]) after administration of the final dose  of the study drug for collection of adverse 
event and concomitant medication information and samples for pharmacokinetic, immunogenicity, and biomarker 
analys es.  
Headache information will be captured using an electronic headache diary device as follows:  
• For patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies, headache informat ion will be captured daily 
during the first 3 months, during the 4 -week period after visit 7, and during the 4 -week period after 
visit 13.  
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01  Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 13  • For patients not rolling over from the pivo tal efficacy studies, headache information will be captured 
daily during the first 4 months, during the 4 -week period after visit 7, and during the 4- week period 
after visit 13.  
Assessments of migraine -related disability and change in quality of life , safety evaluations, and collection of 
pharmacokinetic, immunogenicity, and biomarker samples will be performed throughout the study at prespecified time 
points.  
Method of Blinding and Randomization: The sponsor, investigators, study staff (except for staff involved in 
bioanalytical analyses), and patients will be blinded to treatment assignment.  A computer -generated  master 
randomization list will be provided to drug packaging facilities. Packaging vendor(s) will package study drug into 
kits according to Good Manufacturing Practice procedures. Kits will be identical in appearance and  contain a 
prefilled syringe with active drug  or placebo.  
Patients  will be stratified  by gender , country,  and baseline preventive medication use (yes, no ) during the pivotal 
efficacy studies  or this study  if they are not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy stu dy. 
Patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies who were randomized to the active treatment groups will continue receiving the same treatment  throug hout this study . Patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies 
who received pl acebo and patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies will be rand omly  assigned in a 
1:1 ratio to receive quarterly TEV -48125 at 675 mg or monthly TEV -48125 at 225 mg (Note : Patients with CM will 
receive a 675 -mg loading dosing at visit 2 and TEV -48125 at 225 mg at each subsequent visit .).  
The interactive response technology (IRT ) will manage initial drug supply, maintenance of adequate study drug 
supplies on site, and study randomization centrally. At the time of each study visit, the IRT will be queried , and site 
personnel will retrieve and administer a 1.5 -mL volume from each syringe contained in the appropriately numbered 
kit(s).  
Study Drug Dose, Mode of Administration, and Administration Rate:  Prefilled syringes (active or placebo) will 
be contained in uniquely numbered kits and stored (refrigerated  at 2ºC to 8 ºC) on site. Active syringes will contain 
150 mg/mL of TEV -48125, and placebo syringes will contain the same vehicle and excipients as those for active 
injections. Each kit will contain 1 prefilled syringe.   
Study drug will be administered by qualified study personnel as sc injections approximately every 4 weeks (28 days). In order to maintain the study blind, all patients will receive 3 injections at visits  2, 5, 8, and 11 and 
1 injection at all other visits as detailed in  the table below .

Pharmacokinetic s/Biomarkers/Immunogenicity Measures and Time Points:   
Pharmacokinetic Measures and Time Points : Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of TEV -48125 
will be collected from all patients for the purpose of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship 
assessment at time points specified in Table  1 (patients rolling over from the pivotal effica cy studies) and 
Table  2 (patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies). The pharmacodynamic parameters will be 
the efficacy responses.  
The actual date and time of each blood sample, as well as the date and time of the last study drug dose prior to 
each sample, will be recorded in the case report form . 
Immunogenicity Measures and Time Points:  Blood samples for immunogenicity analysis will be collected at 
time points specified in Table  1 (patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies) , Table  2 (patients not 
rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies) , and Table  3 (patie nts rolling over from the pivotal efficacy 
studies for ADA assessment only) . 
Biomarkers Measures and Time Points:  Biomarker blood and urine samples will be collected at time points 
specified in Table  1 (patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies) and Table  2 (patients not rolling 
over from the pivotal efficacy studies).  
A blood sample for pharmacogenomic analysis will be collected from patients who consent to pharmacogenomic analysis and who have not already had a sample collected during the pivotal efficacy studies 
at the baseline visit  or any visit thereafter . 
Allowed and Disallowed Medicatio ns Before and During the Study:  
Concomitant (Current) Therapy: Patients will be allowed to remain on stable doses of  up to  1 (patients rolling over 
from the pivotal efficacy studies) or 2 (patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies)  conco mitant 
preventive migraine medication for the duration of the study provi ded the medication has at least moderate evidence 
of efficacy as defined by guidelines ( Silberstein et al 2012 ) and presented in  Appendix  A. Patients on p reventive 
medication must be on a stable dose and regimen for at least 2 months of conse cutive use prior to study entry . 
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01  Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 19  Alternatively , patients must have discontinued the preventive medication at least 5 half- lives prior to screening . If 
discont inuation of preventive med ication is clinically indicated by the investigator (eg, due to no further need or 
safety concerns), the medications may be stopped, and the reason must be recorded.   
Patients will be allowed to use acute medications to treat acute migraine attacks , as needed.  
All concomitant medications taken during the study must be recorded with indication, daily dose, and start and stop 
dates of administration. All patients will be questioned about concomitant medication use at each visit.  
Statistical Considerations:   
Sample Size Rationale:  There are no statistical considerations for this sample size. A total of 1842 patients 
(867 patients from Study TV 48125- CNS -30049, 675 patients  from Study TV48125- CNS -30050, and approximately 
300 patients who did not participate in  the pivotal efficacy studies) are planned for enrollment, and a 3 0% drop- out 
rate is anticipated.  
Analysis of Efficacy: Individuals with CM often complain of continuous levels of very low severity headache, 
which is typically not modified during the earlie r stages of treatment. Accordingly, and following the Classification 
Committee of the International Headache Society guidelines (Silberstein et al 2008 ), headache days of at least 
moderate severity  for both CM an d EM patients  will be defined for the purpose of this study as a  calendar day 
(0:00 to 23:59 ) when the patient reports: 
• a day with headache pain that lasts ≥4 hours with a peak severity of at least moderate severity  
or 
• a day when the patient use d an acute migraine -specific medication (triptans or ergots) to treat a 
headache of any severity or duration  
Migraine day is endorsed based on the same criteria as described in the pivotal studies. For CM patients, a migraine day is endorsed when at least 1 of the f ollowing situations occur:  
• a calendar day  (0:00 to 23:59) dem onstrating ≥ 4 consecutive hours of a headache meeting criteria for 
migraine with or without aura  
• a calendar day (0:00 to 23:5 9) demonstrating ≥4 consecutive hours of a headache meeting criteria for 
probable migraine, a migraine subtype where only 1 migrain e criterion is missing  
• a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating a headache of any duration that was treated with migraine -specific medications (triptans and ergot compounds)  
For EM patients, a migraine day is endorsed when at least 1 of the following s ituations occur:  
• a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating ≥ 2 consecutive hours of a headache meeting criteria for 
migraine with or without aura  
• a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating ≥ 2 consecutive hours of a headache meeting criteria for 
probable migraine, a migraine subtype where only 1  migraine criterion  is missing  
• a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating a headache of any duration that was treated with migraine -specific medications (triptans and ergot compounds)  
Analysis of Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint : There is no primary efficacy endpoint.  
Analysis o f Secondary  Efficacy Endpoint s: There are no secondary endpoints for this study.

Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01  Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 20  Analysis of Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints : All efficacy variables will be summarized descriptively  overall, by 
indication, and by treatment group. For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (n umber [n] of patients , mean, 
standard deviation  [SD] , standard error of mean, median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided for actual 
values and changes from baseline to each  visit. For categorical variables, frequency and percentage will be provided. 
For rollover patients, their baseline is defined as the baseline in the pivotal efficacy studies .  
Safety and Tolerability Analyses: All adverse events will be coded using the Med ical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities.  Each patient will be counted only once in each preferred term or system organ class category for the 
analyses of safety. Summaries will be presented for all adverse events (overall and by severity), adverse events  
determined by the investigator to be related to study treatment, defined as relat ed or with missing relationship  
(overall and by severity), serious adverse events, and adverse events causing withdrawal from the study. Patient 
listings of serious adverse e vents and adverse events leading to withdrawal will be presented.  
Local tolerability findings will be listed and summarized  descriptively.  
Changes in laboratory and vital signs measurement data will be summarized descriptively. All values will be 
compared with prespecified boundaries to identify potentially clinically significant changes or values, and such 
values will be listed.  
The use of concomitant medications will be summarized by therapeutic class using descriptive statistics. 
Concomitant medications will include all medications taken while the patient is treated with study drug.  
Safety data will be summarized descriptively overall, by diagnosis, and by treatment group. For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and  maximum) will be provided for actual values 
and changes from baseline to each time point. For categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided.  
Descriptive summaries of serious adverse events, patient withdrawals due to adverse event s, and potentially 
clinically significant abnormal values (clinical laboratory or vital signs) based on predefined criteria will also be provided.  
If any patient dies during the study, a listing of deaths will be provided , and all relevant information will be 
discussed in the patient narrative included in the clinical study report.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis: Pharmacokinetic plasma concentration results (TEV -48125) will be tabulated 
descriptively at each planned sampling time point by indication and treatment  group . 
Pharmacoki netic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis: The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship will be 
estimated by compartmental techniques. The pharmacokinetic parameters will be based on TEV -48125 
measurements. The pharmacodynamic  parameters  will be  the efficacy responses.  
The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship will be estimated using the most appropriate model after comparing different candidate models for their quality of fit. Covariates that may affect the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynami c relationship will be tested for inclusion in the model. This analysis will be 
reported separately.  
Immunogenicity Analysis: Summary of immunogenicity results will be provided, and the incidence of immunogenicity will be calculated. The impact of immunogenicity on the pharmacokinetic profile, drug efficacy, and clinical safety will be evaluated.  This impact  analysis will be reported separately.  
Biomarkers Analysis: Biomarker analysis will include logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic  curve s, 
and summary statistics . Results  will be reported separately.

 32  1. BACKGROUND I NFORMATION 
1.1. Introduction  
Migraine is a prevalent condition characterized by attacks of headache and associated symptoms 
(such as nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia). The 2 most common forms of migraine, 
migraine without aura and migraine with aura, occur on less than 15 days per month and are 
referred to as episodic forms of migraine (ie, EM) ( Lipton et al 2007). However, appr oximately  
3% of individuals with EM evolve, in any given year, to a significantly more disabling condition 
called chronic migraine ( CM) (Bigal et al 2008 , Lipton et al 2007, Scher et al 2003 ). Individuals 
with CM present with headaches of any severity on 15 or more days per month and have full-
blown migraine on at least 8 days per month ( Classification Committee of the  International 
Headache Society  [IHS], 2013). A sizable proportion of individuals with CM experiences daily 
headaches and, therefore, faces considerable disability ( Bigal and Lipton 2008).  
The pathophysiology of migraine involves central and peripheral events. Activation of structures 
in the brainstem are involved in the modulation of sensory activity, which is impaired during 
migraine attacks. Chronic dysfunction in these structures predisposes migraineurs not only to migraine attacks, but to increased headache frequency ( Goadsby and Hargreaves 2008 ). 
Furthermore, the activation of these structures is also associated with inflammation and protein extravasation at the level of the meningeal blood vessels, muscles and other structures innervated 
by the trigeminal nerve. This combination of peripheral insults (inflammation and plasma protein 
extravasation) with impairment of the inhibitory pain mechanisms at the level of brainstem is 
paramount to frequent migraines ( Goadsby et al 2002 ).  
Calcitonin gene- related peptide (CGRP) is a well -studied neuropeptide found at the centers of 
the migraine processes, both centrally and peripherally ( Eftekhari and Edvinsson 2010). Its role 
in migraine pathophysiology was suggested more than 20 years ago ( Edvinsson and Goadsby 
1990, Goadsby et al 1990). Jugular levels of CGRP are increased during migraine attacks, and  
intravenous ( iv) CGRP administration induces migraine -like headache in most individuals with 
migraine ( Ashina et al 2000, Hansen et al 2010). Calcitonin gene- related peptide is therefore 
involved in the pathophysiology of migraine at all levels, peripherally (vasodilation, 
inflammation and protein extravasation), at the trigeminal ganglion,  and inside the brain ( Ho et al 
2010). Inhibition of CGRP has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of EM ( Hewitt et al 2011 , 
Ho et al 2008, Olesen et al 2004 ). 
The goals of migraine treatment are to relieve pain, restore function, reduce headache frequency, 
and to prevent progression of EM to CM. Pharmacological interventions for the treatment of migraine include acute (symptomatic) treatments and daily preventive medications. The latter is 
indicated for patients with CM and may be appropriate patients with EM who have significant 
disability with migraine attacks, contraindications to triptans or other vasoactive medications, significant adverse effects from triptans, and patients with severe or prolonged attacks ( Lipton 
and Silberstein 2015). Currently available drug therapies for preventive treatment of migraine include antiepileptic drugs, beta blockers, triptans, antidepressants, angiotensin receptor 
blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, serotonergic agents, calcium channel 
blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and direct vascular smooth muscle

 33  relaxants. Although there are more than 40 medications within these classes of drugs that are 
used with varying response rates to prevent migraine, only 5 marketed drugs are approved by the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States (US) for the preventive treatment of migraine; 4 of them are approved for the prophylaxis of migraine: propranolol, timolol maleate, 
divalproex sodium, and topiramate. The clinical studies (Brandes et al 2004, Klapper 1997, 
Mathew et al 1995 , Nadelmann et al 1986, Silberstein et al 2004 ) that supported registration of 
these drugs for this indication were conducted before the establishment of CM as a single entity 
and generally included patients with headaches on less than 15 days per month. Only 
1 medication, onabotulinumtoxinA, is approved for prophylaxis of CM  (Lipton and Silberstein 
2015).  
TEV -48125 (also known as PF-04427429, RN307, or LBR-101) is a fully humanized 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) 2a/kappa monoclonal antibody derived from a murine precursor. TEV -48125 is a potent, selective CGRP binder and blocks both CGRP isoforms (α - and 
β-CGRP) from binding to the CGRP receptor. TEV-48125 is specific for CGRP and does not 
bind to the closely related family members amylin, calcitonin, or adrenomedullin peptides. Two mutations were introduced into the constant region of the TEV-48125 heavy chain to limit 
antibody effector functions. This loss of function prevents TEV-48125 from stimulating 
antibody- dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity and triggering complement- mediated lysis; these 
activities can lead to unwanted consequences such as cell lysis, opsonization, and cytokine release and inflammation ( Armour et al 1999, Zeller et al 2008 ). 
The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of TEV-48125 (iv doses ranging from 0.2 to 2000 mg and subcutaneous [sc] doses of 225 and 900 mg) has been well- characterized in the Phase 1 
development program (see Section 1.3.2.1).  Furthermore, the safety and effectiveness of 
TEV -48125 has been demonstrated in a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b 
study of 2 sc dosing regimens of TEV-48125 (monthly TEV-48125 at 900 mg or TEV-48125 at 
675 mg followed by monthly TEV-48125 at 225 mg) in patients with CM and a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo- controlled Phase 2 b study of 2 sc dosing regimens of TEV-48125 
(monthly TEV-48125 at 675 or 225 mg) in patients with EM (see Section 1.3.2.2). The 
acceptable tolerability, long terminal eliminatio n half- life (t
½, approximately 45 days) and ability 
to administer sc make TEV -48125 an attractive therapeutic candidate for the preventive 
treatment of CM and EM . 
1.2. Name and Description of Investigational Product  
TEV -48125 (formerly LBR-101, PF-04427429, or RN307) is a fully humanized IgG2a /kappa 
monoclonal antibody derived from a murine precursor. TEV-48125 is being developed for 
administration by the sc route. A more detailed description of the product is given in Section 3.9.  
1.3. Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies 
1.3.1. Nonclinical Studies  
In vivo pharmacology studies of TEV-48125 in animal models indicate that TEV-48125 
prevented an increase in blood flow in rat paw skin and the middle meningeal artery after 
electrical stimulation and produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the capsaicin-induced skin flare response in cynomolgus monkey. 
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01  Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 34  Safety pharmacology parameters of TEV -48125 were assessed in the pivotal toxicology studies 
in Sprague Dawley rats and cynomol gus monkeys and a separate cardiovascular safety 
pharmacology study in male cynomolgus monkeys. There were no treatment- related changes in 
electrocardiograms (ECGs) and heart rates in the 1 - and 3-month toxicity studies, and a single iv 
dose of TEV- 48125 a t 100 mg/kg did not result in changes in cardiovascular parameters or body 
temperature in monkeys. Additionally, no target organ toxicity was identified. In these 
referenced studies, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) ranged from 100 to 
300 mg/kg  dosed either iv or sc. In a 3-month monkey study, perivascular inflammation of the 
ciliary artery was observed in a few animals at doses ≥100 mg/kg. The inflammation was 
suspected  to be the result of immune complex formation/deposition from the monkeys’ 
immunogenic response to the drug (TEV-48125). In the pivotal 6-month chronic toxicity study in monkeys following once-weekly sc dosing at dosage levels of up to 300 mg/kg/week, achieving high exposure throughout the study, no microscopic findings were noted in any of the organs, 
including the ciliary  vessels of the eyes , and the NOAEL of the chronic toxicity study was 
determined to be the highest dose tested, 300 mg/kg/week. Thus, it is believed that in view of the 
low frequency (ie, observed in very few ani mals) and minimal severity, the finding (perivascular 
inflammation) that was only recorded in the 3 -month toxicity study, and had been resolved 
during the recovery period, is an incidental finding.  
The pharmacokinetics of TEV-48125 in animals (rats and monkeys) is typical of a humanized 
IgG2 molecule, with low mean plasma clearance, low volume of distribution at steady state, and 
a long t
½. Exposure as defined by the maximum observed plasma drug concentration (C max) and 
the area under the plasma concentrat ion-time curve increased linearly across doses following 
single and repeated once-weekly dosing. No gender differences in exposure were observed in rats or monkeys. 
Additionally, pivotal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rabbits and rats w ith 
TEV -48125 were conducted and completed . Preliminary data suggest that weekly dosing with 
TEV -48125 was well tolerated and did not induce any obvious maternal toxicity at any dose 
level. No apparent evidence of embryo- fetal toxicity was noted in any dose group. 
Overall, no toxicological concerns were identified following up to 6 months of dosing to the 
experimental animals.  
Further details may be found in the current Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.3.2. Clinical Studies  
To date, TEV -48125 has been studied in 6 Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and 
2 Phase 2b studies in patients with migraine. In total, 484 subjects ( 118 healthy volunteers and 
366 migraine patients) received at least 1 dose of TEV -48125 via iv or sc administration. 
A brief summary of clinical pha rmacology and clinical safety and efficacy studies of TEV -48125 
follows. Further details may be found in the current Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.3.2.1. Clinical Pharmacology Studies 
A total of 118 subjects received at least 1 dose of TEV-48125 across 6 completed Phase 1 studies 
at doses ranging from 0.2 through 2000 mg. Studies included 2 single-dose- escalation 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in healthy men (Studies B0141001 and 
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01  Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 35  B0141002); a 2-cohort, placebo-controlled, cross-over study to examine the a cute effects 
administration of TEV -48125 on capsaicin flare response in healthy men (Study B0141006); a 
parallel -group, repeat -dose study of TEV-48125 in healthy men and women (Study B0141007); 
a single -dose study evaluating the safety, tolerability , and pharmacokinetics of doses up to 
2000 mg administered to healthy women (Study LBR -101-008); and a single-dose study 
comparing the safety, tolerability, absolute bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics if sc and iv 
TEV -48125 in healthy men and women (Study LBR -101-011). 
Based on noncompartmental analysis, TEV-48125 exposure increases with dose in an approximately dose-proportional manner from 225 to 900 mg following sc administration and over the dose range from 100 to 2000 mg following iv infusion. The C
max occurred near the end 
of the iv infusion (median time to C max [tmax] of 1 to 5 hours after the start of the infusion), and 
Cmax was prolonged as indicated by the delayed t max (median t max 96 to 108 hours postdose) after 
sc administration. The mean t ½ following sc administration was similar to that observed after iv 
administration for each dose level. The t ½ ranged from approximately 642 to 770 hours 
(approximately 27 to 32 days) at the 225-mg dose level, and the t ½ ranged from approximately 
1140 to 1200 hours (approximately 48 to 50 days) at the 900-mg dose level. Absolute bioavailability of the sc dose was approximately 55%.  
TEV -48125 was well tolerated with favorable safety profile. The treatment -emergent adverse 
events reported in the Phase 1 studies were pr edominantly mild to moderate in severity. A 
specific “pattern of adverse events” that could be associated with a dose or a dose range of TEV -48125 has not been identified, nor has a maximally tolerated dose been identified. The 
most common treatment- emergent adverse events reported were headache, nasopharyngitis, 
gastroenteritis, and back pain. There were no deaths. One serious adverse event reported as “thoracic aortic aneurysm aggravated” in an individual receiving a single iv 300 -mg TEV -48125 
dose resolved.  
TEV -48125 does not appear to be associated with any clinically relevant patterns of change in 
vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, temperature and heart rate) or cardiac conduction and repolarization (P- R interval, QT interval corrected for heart rate using Bazett’s 
and Fridericia’s formulas) measured by frequent 12-lead ECGs. No changes in liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) or difference s between TEV -48125 and placebo in hematological 
parameters, tests assessing renal function, electrolytes, or urinalysis has been observed in any of the Phase 1 studies. 
1.3.2.2. Clinical Safety and Efficacy Studies  
The safety, tolerability, and efficacy of TEV-48125 was evaluated in migraine patients in 
2 Phase 2b studies. The 1
st study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo -controlled, parallel-group study comparing the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics of 2 doses of TEV-48125 with placebo in 264 patients with CM (Study  LBR -101-021). Following a 28- day run -in period, participants were randomized and 
treated sc once monthly for 3 months. One active group received a 1
st dose of 675 mg followed 
by 225 mg on the subsequent 2 months. The other active group received 900 mg per month. The mean change in headache hours relative to baseline for each TEV -48125 dose arm was 
significantly different from the placebo arm at 3 months (primary endpoint), and the study was

Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01  Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 36  also positive at 2 and 1 mo nths. Both doses were also superior to placebo for the secondary 
endpoint (decrease in the number of days with moderate or severe headache at 3 months). At the 
doses tested, TEV-48125 was well tolerated, and no serious treatment- related adverse events 
were reported. Most adverse events were mild to moderate. No safety signals were observed in the clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examination, or ECGs.  
The 2
nd study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group 
study comparing the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of 2 doses of TEV-
48125 with placebo in 297 patients with EM (Study LBR-101-022). Following a 28-day run-in 
period, participants were randomized and treated sc once monthly for 3 months. Two active doses were tested, 225 mg given monthly for 3 months and 675 mg given monthly for 3 months. 
The mean change in number of migraine days at month 3 relative to baseline for both TEV-
48125 dose arms was significantly different from placebo at 3 (primary endpoint), 2, and 1 months. Secondary and exploratory endpoints were also positive for the duration of the study. 
Both doses were well tolerated, and no serious treatment- related adverse events were reported. 
Most adverse events were mild to moderate and the lowest dose had a numerically lower number 
of adverse events relatively to placebo. No safety signals were observed in the clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examination, or ECGs.  
1.4. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Patients  
1.4.1. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits of  TEV -48125  
Information regarding risks and benefits of TEV-48125 to human patients may be found in the current Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.4.1.1. Risks of TEV -48125 
Identified risks (adverse drug reactions) of T EV-48125 include injection site erythema, 
administration site pain, injection site pain, injection site pruritus, injection site dermatitis,  
infusion- related  reaction , and drug hypersensitivity. None of the identified risks are considered 
important risks.  
Potential risks for TEV -48125 are perivascular inflammation; development of antidrug 
antibodies (ADAs); liver enzyme elevations; and cardiovascular c onsequences of CGRP 
inhibition, including 
effects on blood pressure, heart rate,  or other cardiovascular pa rameters.  
As described in Section 1.3.2.2, sc TEV -48125 has generally been well tolerated over the ranges 
of doses evaluated (single doses of 0.02 to 2000 mg in healthy volunteers, multiple doses of 
30 to 300 mg in healthy volunteers, and multiple doses of 225 to 900 mg in migraine patients). 
The most common treatment- emergent adverse events across the clinical program were  mild to 
moderate transient  general administration site disorders/reactions. Other commonly reported 
treatment -emergent adverse events were headache, back pain, and upper respiratory tract 
infection.  
1.4.1.2. Benefits of TEV -48125 
As described in Section 1.3.2.2, results from Phase 2 b clinical studies have demonstrated 
statistically significant reductions in mean headache hours after 1, 2, and 3 months of 
TEV -48125 treatment in patients with CM and statistically significant reductions in monthly 
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01  Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 37  migraine days after 1, 2, and 3 months of TEV-48125 treatment in pa tients with EM.  Results for 
several secondary/exploratory endpoints also showed TEV-48125 to be superior to placebo. 
1.4.2. Overall Risk and Benefit Assessment for This Study  
Based on the current safety profile and the demonstrated efficacy of the sc TEV -48125 dosage 
form, the overall risk and benefit assessment for this study is favorable. 
1.5. Selection of Drugs and Dosages 
A detailed description of study drug administration is presented in Section  5.1. 
This study is  a multi- arm evaluation of the long- term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the 
TEV -48125 doses and regimen s administered in the pivotal efficacy studies. The doses and 
regimens  for the pivotal efficacy studies are supported by data gathered from animal and human 
(healthy volunteer) pharmacokinetic studies, in vivo pharmacodynamic neurogenic inflammation 
experiments in primates, safety and efficacy results of the Phase 2b studies in patients with CM 
and EM, and population pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pha rmacodynamic models and 
simulations.  
This study will include patients who are rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies, patients 
who are not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies, and patients who are rolling over from 
the pivotal efficacy studies for ADA assessment only (ie, these patients will not receive study drug during the current study). Treatments for patients receiving study drug during the current study will be as follows:  
• Patients who complete the pivotal efficacy studies and who received active study drug 
will continue the dose and regimen  they received in those studies for 12  months.  
• Patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies who received placebo and 
patients not rolling over will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive monthly TEV -48125 at 225 mg (Note: Patients with CM will receive a 675-mg loading dosing 
at visit 2 and TEV-48125 at 225 mg at each subsequent visit) or quarterly TEV-48125 at 675 mg.  
The doses an d regimen s selected for the long -term safet y study enable a long -term safety 
evaluation of the doses administered in the pivotal studies as well as examine the maintenance of effect with increased exposure. This study provides the placebo- treated  patients from pivotal 
studies and new patients the oppor tunity to receive potential benefit from therapeutic doses, and 
it is the customary way to conduct a long- term safety study by which patients are allowed to 
continue on their current dose and regimen. 
In general, all patients will receive at least 12 month s exposur e to TEV -48125 in accordance 
with the International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH) E1 guideline: "the extent of 
population exposure to assess clinical safety for drugs intended for long -term treatment of 
non life -threatening conditions". This long- term exposure is supported by the long- term 
(6-month) chronic toxicity study in monkeys. In this study, male and female cynomolgus 
monkeys received a weekly sc  administration of TEV -48125 at a dose of 0, 10, 100, or 
300 mg/kg. Thes e doses are equivalen t to 290, 2900, and 6900 mg, respectively, administered 
weekly for a duration of 6 months in humans. No mortalities occurred during the conduct of the 
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01  Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 38  study, and no test article -related clinical observations and  alterations in body weight were noted. 
Test article -related abnormalities were noted.  
1.6. Compliance Statement  
This study will be conducted in full accordance with the ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
Consolidated Guideline (E6) and any applicable national and local laws and regulations 
(eg, Title  21 Code of Federal Regulations [21CFR] Parts 11, 50, 54, 56, 312, and 314, European 
Union [EU] Directive 2001/20/EC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and 
administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the implementation of GCP in the 
conduct of clinical studies on medicinal products for human use). Any episode of noncompliance 
will be documented. 
The investigator is responsible for performing the study in accordance with this protocol and the 
applicable GCP guidelines referenced above for  collecting, recording, and reporting the data 
accurately and properly . Agreement of the investigator  to conduct and administer this study in 
accordance with the protocol will be documented in separate study agreements with the sponsor and other forms as required by national authorities in the country where each investigational 
center  is located.   
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the privacy, health, and welfare of the patients during 
and after the study and must ensure that trained personnel ar e immediately available in the event 
of a medical emergency . The investigator and the applicable study staff must be familiar with the 
background to, and requirements of, the study and with the properties of the study drug(s) as 
described in the Investigator’s Brochure or prescribing information.  
The principal investigator at each investigational center  has the overall responsibility for the 
conduct and administration of the study at that center  and for contacts with study management, 
with the Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB) , and with local 
authorities.  
1.7. Population to b e Studied  and Justification  
The study population will be composed of 3 subgroups of patients as follows: 
• Patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies  
• Patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies (new patients)  
• Patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies for ADA evaluation only  
Female and male patients  must be 18 to 70 years  of age ( inclusive ) at the time of screening  with 
a history of migraine (as defined by International Classification of Headache Disorders, 
3rd revision [ICHD- 3] criteria [ Classification Committee of the  IHS, 2013]) or clinical judgement 
suggests a migraine diagnosis for at least  12 months prior to screening and a diagnosis of CM or 
EM. For new patients, the diagnosis will be prospectively documented via review of headache 
data recorded daily in an electronic headache diary device during a 28 -day run-in period. 
New patients (not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies) will be allowed to remain on up 
to 2 concomitant preventive medication s for migraine , provided that they were on a stable doses 
for at least 2 months prior to study entry. Similarly, patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies using concomitant preventive medications (up to 30% of the patients in the 
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01  Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 39  pivotal efficacy studies may be using no more than 1 preventive medication for migraine) will be 
allowed to continue taking the  medication during this study. Those not using preventive 
medications for migraine will be asked not to initiate preventive medications de novo during the 
safety extension study. Medications in scope as concomitant preventive medications are those 
with at least moderate evidence of efficacy for migraine (Silberstein et al 2012 ). A list of 
preventive medications is pre sented in Appendix A .  
Patients on acceptable concomitant preventive medicatio n(s) at study entry will be encouraged to 
continue their preventive medication regimen without change for the duration of the study. If 
discontinuation is clinically indicated by the investigator (eg, due to no further need or safety concerns), the medicat ion may be stopped, and the reason must be recorded.  
Episodic migraine  is a highly prevalent condition and a significant cause of disability, especially 
in patients with high frequency EM. Furthermore, 3% to 6% of patients with EM evolve in any given year  to CM, which is significantly more disabling ( Scher et al 2003). Risk factors for 
evolution from EM to CM include high headache frequency and the use of specific classes of acute medication, including barbiturates and opiates ( Bigal et al 2008 ).  
Aside from limiting migraine -associated disability, it is expected that effective preventive 
migraine medications should decrease the likelihood that a patient with EM will evolve to CM. However, available preventive medications have variable response rates and are associated with adverse effects. In addition, only 4 are approved for preventive treatment of EM ( Lipton and 
Silberstein 2015, Shamliyan et al 2013).  
Patients with CM have significant disability despite availability of many pharmacological (approved and off label) and nonpharmacological treatments. The persistence of CM -associated 
disability likely reflects variable response rates, adverse effects of available preventive treatments, and the paucity of approved preventive treatments  (Lipton and Silberstein 2015, 
Shamliyan et al 2013).  
1.8. Location and Timing of Study  
This study is planned to be conducted in approximately 15 countries , including North and South 
Ameri ca, the European Union, and Asia Pacific, at approximately 140 centers. It is expected to 
start in 1Q 2016 and have a duration of approximately 2.5 years . Additional centers will be 
added, if needed. Expected duration of the study may also be extended dependent on enrollment speed and other factors.

 44  3. STUDY DESIGN 
3.1. General Design and Study Schema  
This is an approximately 19-month, multicenter, randomized, double- blind, parallel -group study 
to evaluate the long -term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of sc TEV -48125 in adult patients with 
migraine. For patients who complete the pivotal efficacy s tudies of TEV-48125 
(Studies TV48125- CNS -30049 and TV 48125- CNS -30050), the study will consist of a 12-month 
treatment period and a 6.5-month follow-up period. For patients who have not participated in a 
pivotal efficacy study, the study will consist of a screening visit and 28- day run -in period, a 
12-month treatment period, and a 6.5-month follow -up period. 
Female and male patients 18 to 70 years of age , inclusive, with CM and EM who complete the 
pivotal efficacy studies (Studies TV48125- CNS -30049 and TV48125- CNS -30050) and 
approximately 300 patients (approximately half of whom have a diagnosis of CM and half of 
whom have a diagnosis of EM) who have not participated in the pivotal efficacy studies may 
enter this long- term safety , tolerability,  and efficacy  study if  they meet the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and provide informed consent. In addition, patients who do not complete the pivotal 
efficacy studies and those patients who complete the pivotal efficacy studies but do not wish to continue treatment during this long- term safety , tolerability , and efficacy  study may attend a 
follow-up visit during this study for the purpose of ADA assessment approximately 7.5 months 
after their last dose of study drug.   
New p atients (not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies) using up to 2 preventive 
medication s at the time of the screening visit will be allowed to remain on the medication s if the 
medication s have at least moderate evidence of efficacy for migraine ( Silberstein et al 2012 ) and 
provided that they are on stable doses for at least 2  months prior to study entry. Similarly, 
patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies using concomitant preventive medications (up to 30% of the patients in the pivotal efficacy studies may be using no more than 1 prevent ive 
medication for migraine)  will be allowed to continue taking the  medication during this study. 
Patients will be encouraged to continue their preventive medication regimen without change for the duration of the study. If discont inuation is clinically ind icated by the investigator (eg, due to 
no further need or safety concerns), the medication may be stopped, and the reason must be recorded . A list of preventive medications is presented in Appendix A . Patients wh o are not 
using preventive medications for migraine at the time of study entry will be asked not to initiate 
preventive medications de novo during the safety extension study. Patients will be allowed to use 
acute medications to treat acute migraine attacks, as needed . 
Patients who have not participated in a pivotal efficacy study will complete the informed consent 
process and be screened for eli gibility at visit 1. Eligible patients will enter a 28 -day run-in 
period during which they will complete daily ele ctronic headache diary entries . After completing 
the run-in period, patients  will be asked to return to the study center on day 0 (visit 2). P atients 
who have confirmed CM (≥15 headache days with migraine on ≥8 days) or EM with headache 
days on ≥ 4 and ≤14 days with migraine on ≥ 3 days and meet all other eligibility criteria 
(including electronic headache diary compliance criteria d uring the 28- day run -in period) at 
visit 2 w ill complete baseline assessments/procedures before beginning study treatment.

Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01  Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 45  Patients  who rollover fr om the pivotal efficacy studies  and are eligible to participate in this study  
will begin this study at visit 2 after completing the informed consent proc ess. Visit 2 may 
correspond with the end-of- treatment (EOT) visit (visit 5) or it may be a separate visit.  For 
patients who begin this study on the same day as EOT visit (visit 5) for the pivotal efficacy studies, 
EOT visit procedures/assessments must be c ompleted before beginning visit 2 
procedures/assessments . Baseline for patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies refers 
to the 28-day run-in period (for headache variables only) and visit 2 (day 0) of the pivotal 
efficacy studies.  
Patients randomized to the active treatment groups in the pivotal efficacy studies  who continue 
receiving study drug in the current study will receive the same treatment throughout the current  
study. Thus, patients with CM who received a loading dose of TEV-48125 at 675 mg followed 
by monthly sc TEV-48125 at 225 mg and patients with EM who received monthly sc TEV -48125 at 225 mg will continue receiving monthly sc TEV -48125 at 225 mg, and patients 
with CM or EM who received sc TEV-48125 at 675 mg once in 3 months will continue receiving quarterly sc TEV -48125 at 675 mg.  
Patients with CM randomized to the placebo treatment group in the pivotal efficacy study who 
continue receiving study drug in the current study and patients with CM who are not rolling over 
from the pivotal efficacy study will be randomized at vis it 2 in a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 of 
2 treatments: 
• sc TEV -48125 at 675 mg (loading dose) followed by 11 monthly sc doses of 
TEV -48125 at 225 mg 
• sc TEV -48125 at 675 mg once every 3 months for 12 months for a total of 4 doses 
Patients with EM randomized to the placebo treatment group in the pivotal efficacy study who continue receiving study drug in the current study and patients with EM who are not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy study will be randomized at visit 2 in a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 of 2 treatments: 
• monthly sc TEV-48125 at 225 mg for 12 months 
• sc TEV -48125 at 675 mg once every 3 months for 12 months for a total of 4 doses 
(Note: For this study and the pivotal efficacy studies, monthly dosing refers to dosing approximately every 4  weeks [28 days].) 
First treatment administration (ie, for this study) will occur at visit 2, and additional doses will be 
administered at each visit (approximately every 4 weeks ) through visit 13. Patients will return for 
the EOT visit (visit 14) approximately 4 weeks  after administration of the final dose of study 
drug, and they will return approximately 7.5 months (225 days [ the approximate equivalent of 
5 half -lives ]) after administration of the final dose of the study drug for collection of adverse 
event and concomitant medication information and samples for pharmacokinetic, 
immunogenicity, and biomarker analyses.  
Headache information will be captured using an electronic headache diary device as follows:  
• For patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies, headache information will be captured daily during the first 3 months, during the 4-week period after visit 7, and during the 4-week period after visit 13.

Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01  Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 46  • For patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies, headache information 
will be captured daily during the first 4 months, during the 4-week period after visit 7, and during the 4-week period after visit 13. 
Assessments of migraine -related disability and change in quality of life (using the HIT-6 or 
MIDAS  questionnaire , PHQ- 2/PHQ-9, PGIC scale, MSQOL  questionnaire , EQ-5D- 5L 
questionnaire, and WPAI questionnaire), safety evaluations, and collection of  pharmacokinetic, 
immunogenicity, and biomarker samples  will be performed throughout the study according to the 
schedules of assessments ( Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3) and Section  3.14.  
Patients who withdraw from the study before completing the 12- month treatment period will 
have EOT visit (visit 14) procedures and assessments performed at their final visit, and they will be asked to return for the follow-up visit approximately 7.5 months (225 days  [the approximate 
equivalent of 5 half- lives] ) after their last dose of study drug.  
The study schemas for patients with CM and EM who receive study drug in the current study are  
presented i n Figure  1 and  Figure  2, respectively . 
The end of the study is defined as the date the last patient attends the follow-up visit (visit 15).  
A total of 1 842 patients, including approximately 867 patients with CM and 675 patients with 
EM from the pivotal efficacy studies and approximately 300 patients  (approximately half of 
whom have a diagnosis of CM and half of whom have a diagnosis of EM ) who have not 
participated  in the pivotal efficacy  studies , are eligible for enrollment  in this  study.

 49  3.2. Justification for Study Design  
A randomized, double-blind, parallel -group design is appropriate given the objectives of this 
study.  
The dosing regimen planned for this study is consistent with the dosing regimen in the pivotal 
efficacy studies . 
In order to blind the treatment groups based on both dose-volume and number of injections, each patient will receive three 1.5- mL sc injections (three 1.5-mL sc injections of active drug, one 
1.5-mL sc injection of active drug and two 1.5-mL injections of placebo, or three 1.5- mL 
injections of placebo ) at visits 2, 5, 8, and 11. See Section  5.1 for additional details.   
3.3. Primary and Secondary Efficacy Measures and Time Points  
All efficacy mea sures are exploratory.  
3.3.1. Primary Efficacy Measure and Time Point s 
There is no primary efficacy measure.  
3.3.2. Secondary Efficacy Measures and Time Points  
There are no secondary efficacy measures.  
3.4. Safety and Tolerability Measures and Time Points  
Safety  and tolerabi lity will be assessed at time points specified in Table 1 (patients rolling over 
from the pivotal efficacy studies), Table 2 (patients not rolling over from the pivotal effic acy 
studies), and Table 3 (patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies for ADA assessment only) using the following measures , as applicable: 
• inquiries about adverse events 
• inquiries about concomitant medication usage
 
• vital signs measurements  (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, temperature, 
and respiratory rate)  
• 12-lead ECG s 
• physical examination, including weight  
• safety laboratory tests (serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis)  
• serum/ urine beta -human chorionic gonadotropin ( β-HCG) tests  (women of 
childbearing potential only) 
• injection site reaction (ie, erythema, induration, ecchymosis, and pain) assessments

Clinica l Study Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 50  3.5. Pharmacokinetic/Immunogenicity/Biomarker  Measures and Time 
Points  
A description of the pharmacokinetic, biomarker, and immunogenicity measures is provided in 
Section  8. 
3.5.1. Pharmacokinetic Measures and Time Points  
Bloo d samples for pharmacokinetic analysis  of TEV -48125 will be collected  from all patients for 
the purpose of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship assessment  at time  points 
specified in Table 1 (patients rollin g over from the pivotal efficacy studies) and Table 2 (patients 
not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies). The pharmacodynamic parameters will be the efficacy responses.  
The actual date and time of each b lood sample, as well as the date and time of the last study drug 
dose prior to each sample, will be recorded in the case report form (CRF ). 
3.5.2. Immunogenicity Measures and Time Points  
Blood samples for immunogenicity analysis will be collected at time points s pecified in Table 1 
(patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies) , Table 2 (patients not rolling over from 
the pivotal efficacy studies) , and Table 3 (patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies 
for ADA assessment only).  
3.5.3. Biomarker Measures and Time Points  
Biomarker blood and urine samples will be collected at time points specified in Table 1 (patients 
rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies) and Table 2 (patients not rolling over from the 
pivotal efficacy studies).  
A blood sample for pharmacogenomic analysis will be collected  from patients who consent to 
pharmacogenomic analysis  and who have not already had a sample collected during the pivotal 
efficacy studies  at the baseline visit or any visit thereafter . 
3.6. Exploratory Measures and Time Points  
Efficacy will be assessed at time points specified in Table 1 (patients rolling over from the 
pivotal efficacy studies) and Table 2 (patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies) 
using the fol lowing exploratory efficacy measures:  
• exploratory efficacy endpoints derived from headache data (ie, occurrence of headache, duration of headache, maximum severity of headache, and acute migraine -specific medication use), which will be collected using an e lectronic 
headache diary device  
• HIT-6 (patients with CM only) 
• MIDAS questionnaire (patients with EM only) 
• PHQ- 2/PHQ- 9 (Note: Patients will first respond to the PHQ -2. They will respond to 
questions 3 through 9 [unique questions] of the PHQ -9 only if the PHQ-2 is positive.) 
• MSQOL questionnaire  
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinica l Study Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 51  • EQ-5D- 5L questionnaire 
• PGIC scale  
• WPAI questionnaire 
A description of the efficacy measures is provided in Section 6.  
3.7. Randomization and Blinding  
The sponsor, investigators, study staff (except for staff involved in bioanalytical analyses), and 
patients will be blinded to treatment assignment. The Sponsor will be unblinded when the pivotal 
efficacy studies have been unblinded. A computer- generated  master randomization list will 
provided to drug packaging facilities. Packaging vendor(s) will package study drug into kits according to Good Manufacturing Practice procedures. Kits will be identical in appearance, and  
will contain 1 prefilled syringe with active drug or placebo. Ade quate kit supply for upcoming 
study visits will be managed by interactive response technology ( IRT) and kept (refrigerated at 
2°C to 8°C) on site. 
Patients will be stratified by gender, country, and  baseline preventive medication use (yes, no) 
during the pivotal efficacy studies or this study if they are not rolling over from the pivotal 
efficacy study.  
Patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies who were randomized to the active treatment groups will continue receiving the same treatment throughout the study . Patients 
rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies who received placebo and patients not rolling over 
will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive quarterly TEV -48125 at 675 mg or monthly 
TEV -48125 at 225 mg (Note: P atients with  CM will receive a 675 -mg loading dosing at visit 2 
and TEV -48125 at 225 mg at each subsequent visit.).  
The IRT will manage initial drug supply, maintenance of adequate study drug supplies on site, 
and study randomization centrally. At the time of each st udy visit, the IRT will be queried , and 
site personnel will retrieve and administer a 1.5 -mL volume from each syringe contained in the 
appropriately numbered kit(s). 
3.8. Maintenance of Randomization and Blinding  
3.8.1. Randomization  
Patient randomization codes will be maintained in a secure location within Teva Clinical Supply Chain. At the time of analysis, when treatment codes are needed, the Teva statistician assigned to the study will make a request to unblind and will receive the unblinded codes. 
3.8.2. Blinding/Unblin ding  
Pharmacokinetic data may be assessed during the study. Personnel responsible for bioanalysis 
will be provided with the randomization code in order to facilitate the analysis. However, the 
personnel responsible for bioanalysis will not have access to c linical safety and efficacy data and 
will provide concentration data to other personnel in a manner that will not identify individual 
patients (ie, a dummy patient identifier will be linked to an individual patient’s concentration data).  
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinica l Study Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 52  For information about personnel who may be aware of treatment assignments, see Section  3.7. 
These individuals will not be involved in conduct of any study procedures or assessment of any 
adverse events . 
In case of a serious adver se event or pregnancy, or in cases when knowledge of the study drug 
assignment is needed to make treatment decisions, the investigator may unblind the patient’s drug assignment as deemed necessary, mainly in emergency situations. Individual treatment codes , indicating the treatment randomization for each randomized patient, will be available to 
the investigator(s) and/or pharmacist(s) at the study center via the IRT, both via telephone and 
internet. If possible, the sponsor should be notified of the event prior to breaking of the code. If this is not possible, the sponsor should be notified immediately afterwards, and the patient’s drug 
code assignment should not be revealed. Breaking of the treatment code can always be 
performed by the site without prior approval by the sponsor. 
When a blind is broken, the patient will be withdrawn from the study, and the event will be 
recorded onto the CRF. The circumstances leading to the breaking of the code should be fully 
documented in the investigator’s study files and in the patient’s source documentation. Treatment assignment should not be recorded in any study documents or source documents. 
In blinded studies, for adverse events that are defined as suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reaction (SUSAR) (ie, reasonable possibility; see Section  7.1.4), Global Patient Safety & 
Pharmacovigilance may independently request that the treatment code be revealed (on a 
case- by-case basis) to comply with regulatory requirements. The repo rt will be provided in an 
unblinded manner for regulatory submission. If this occurs, blinding will be maintained for the 
investigator and for other personnel involved in the conduct, analysis, and reporting of the data. 
3.8.3. Data Monitoring Committee 
This is n ot applicable.  
3.9. Drugs Used in the Study  
Additional details may also be found in the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure for 
TEV -48125.  
TEV -48125 will be provided as a sterile, unpreserved, colorless to slightly yellow, aqueous 
solution for injection, supplied in a 2.25- mL prefilled syringe for single -use administration, 
containing 150 mg/mL in 16±2.5 mM L-histidine, 0.2-mg/mL polysorbate 80, 84- mg/mL 
sucrose, and 0.136- mg/mL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).  
TEV -48125 will be administered sc at a dose of 225 mg at visits 2 through 13. Each dose will be 
separated by approximately 4 weeks ( 28 days). A more detailed description of administration 
procedures is given in Section 5.1. 
This is  an uncontrolled study with no other study drug.  
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinica l Study Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 53  3.10. Drug Supply and Accountability  
3.10.1. Drug Storage and Security  
The study drug (TEV -48125) must be stored refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F), protected 
from light; the site should have a process for monitoring the drug storage temperature. 
TEV -48125 supplies must be kept in a secure area (eg, locked refrigerator).  
3.10.2. Drug Accountability  
Each study drug shipment will include a packing slip listing the contents of the shipment, drug return instructions, and any applicable fo rms.  
Each investigator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of study drug and other study materials from Teva are correctly received, recorded, handled, stored, accounted for, and used in 
accordance with this protocol. In addition, each investigator is responsible for ensuring that study 
drug and other material from Teva are correctly disposed of, safely and properly in accordance with local regulation.  
A record of study drug accountability (ie, study drug and other materials received, used, retain ed, 
returned, or destroyed) must be prepared and signed by the principal investigator or designee, with an account given for any discrepancies . 
3.11. Duration of Patient Participation  and Justification  
This study will consist of a 28-day run -in period (only for patients not rolling over from the 
pivotal efficacy  studies) and a 12- month treatment period . Patients will be followed for 
7.5 months (225 days) after administration of the final dose of study drug (ie, a 6.5-month 
follow-up period) for collection of pharmacokinetic, immunogenicity, and biomarker samples 
and inquiries about adverse events and concomitant medication use. It is considered that, with a 
half-life of around 45 days, there will be a complete washout of the drug  from the circulating 
blood in 7.5 months ( ≥5 half -lives) , allowing a more precise evaluation of ADA.  
Patients are expected to participate in this study for its entire duration, which is a minimum of 18.5 months for patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies or 19.5 months for patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy  studies. In addition, patients rolling over from the 
pivotal efficacy studies for ADA evaluation only will participate in the current study for approximately 7.5 months. See Section  12.4 for the definition of the end of the study. 
3.12. Stopping Rules and Discontinuation Criteria  
There are no formal rules for early termination of this study. During the conduct of the study, 
serious adverse events will be reviewed (see Section  7.1.5) as they are reported from the 
investigational center  to identify safety concerns . The study may be termina ted by the sponsor at 
any time.   
A patient may discontinue participation in the study at an y time for any reason (eg, lack of 
efficacy, consent withdrawn, and adverse event) . The investigator and/or sponsor can withdraw a 
patient from the study at any time for any reason (eg, protocol violation or deviation as defined in Section  11.1.2, noncompliance, or adverse event).  In addition, patients with abnormal hepatic 
laboratory values ( eg, ALT, AST, ALP, gamma- glutamyl transpeptidase  [GGT], total bilirubin, 
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinica l Study Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 54  or international normalized ratio [INR])  may meet criteria for discontinuation from the study 
drug as summarized in Appendix E .  
3.13. Source Data Recorded on the Case Report Form  
All patient data must have supportive original source documentation in the medical records, or 
equivalent, before they are transcribed onto the CRF. Data may not be recorded directly onto the 
CRF and considered as source data unless the sponsor provides written instructions specifying 
which data are permitted to be recorded directly onto the CRF.  
Source data, including test results and/or assessments (eg, clinical laboratory, central ECG 
evaluation center, and electronic headache diary data) collected by other institutions outside of 
the study center, are sent to the investigational center wh ere they are retained but not entered into 
the CRF unless otherwise noted in the protocol. These data may also be sent electronically to the 
sponsor (or organization performing data management) for direct entry into the clinical database 
(see Section  13.1). All data from other institutions will be available to the investigator.  
The CRFs are filed in the sponsor’s central file.  
3.14. Study Procedures  
Study procedures and assessments with their timing are summarized in  Table 1 (patients rolling 
over from the pivotal efficacy studies), Table 2 (patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies) , and Table  3 (patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies for ADA 
assessment only) . Detailed by -visit information is provided in the sections following the table. 
Detailed descriptions of each assessment are provided in Section  6 (efficacy assessments) , 
Section  7 (safety assessments) , and Section 8 (pharmacokinetic and other assessments).

 57  b Patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies will begin study participation at visit 2. If visit 2 corresponds with EOT visit (visit 5) of the pivotal efficacy study, the EOT 
visit procedures/assessments for the pivotal efficacy study must be completed before the patient begins participation in this study, and the EOT procedures/assessments will not be repeated at visit 2. Refer to the protocols for Studies TV48125- CNS -30049 and TV48125-CNS -30050 for details regarding the EOT visit procedures/assessment s. 
c Patients who received placebo in the pivotal efficacy studies will be randomized to receive 1 of 3 TEV -48125 dose regimens (a loading dose of TEV -48125 at 675 mg followed 
by monthly TEV -48125 at 225 mg [CM only], monthly TEV -48125 at 225 mg, or quarterly TEV -48125 at 675 mg).  
d Procedure/assessment will only be completed for patients who enter this study more than 30 days after com pleting visit 5 of  the pivotal efficacy study.  
e Procedure/assessment will be performed before other assessments (eg, blood draws and administration of questionnaires).  
f Serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis.  
g Women of childbearing potential only.  
h Inquiries about adverse events will be made at every visit. At visits 2 through 13, inquiries about adverse events will be ma de before and after study drug administration. 
Postdose inquiries will be made before the patient leaves the study center.  
i The predose adverse event inquiry will only be completed for patients who begin this study on a different day from the EOT vi sit of the pivotal efficacy study.  
j Procedure/assessment will only be completed for patients who begin this study on a different day from the EOT visit of the pi votal efficacy study.  
k As appropriate, patie nts should be treated with standard of care following completion of the EOT/early withdrawal visit.  
l The eC -SSRS Since Last Visit version will be completed.  
m Patients will complete electronic headache diary entries about the previous day daily (beginning on day 1) during the first 3 months, during the 4-week period after visit 7, and

3.14.1. Procedures for Screening of Patients N ot Rolling Over from the Pivotal Efficacy 
Studies  (Visit 1  [Day -28]) 
Patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies will be screened approximately 28 days 
before the baseline visit.  
A signed and dated informed consent form will be obtained before screening procedures commence (see Section  12.1). Evaluations obtained as part of routine medical care and 
performed during the screening period may be used in place of the protocol- specific evaluations . 
In addition, disease- specific assessments performed within a specified time frame before 
informed consent may be used for the study. Patients will acknowledge and agree to the possible use of this information for the study by giving informed consent.  
After informed consent is obtained, patients who are screened will be assigned an 8- digit 
identification number such that all patients from each country are given consecutive 
identification numbers in successive order of inclusion. The first 2 digits of the screening number 
will be the number assigned to the country where the investigational center is located, the next 3 digits will be the investigational center number, and the last 3 digits will be the patient number 
assigned at  the investigator center (eg, the 3
rd patient screened in the US  [country 01] at 
center  101 would be given the number of 01101003).  The screening number is the permanent 
number assigned to the patient for the duration of study. 
After confirmation of study eligibility, patients will be screen failed or randomized into the 
current study. For randomized patients, an enrollment number will be assigned consisting of t he 
8-digit screening number for randomized patients and the last 2 digits of the assigned protocol (ie, 51 for Study TV48125- CNS -30051).  
A patient who is screened and does not meet study entry criteria will not be considered for screening again .

patients who consent to pharmacogenomics analysis if the sample is not obtained at an earlier 
visit.  
Patients who discontinue treatment prematurely must be encouraged to continue to attend the 
regular scheduled visits, and complete the prescribed safety and efficacy evaluations through the 
EOT  visit and the follow- up visit, if at all possible.  
Patients who both discontinue treatment and also withdraw from the study should have EOT 
(early withdrawal) visit procedures/assessments ( see Table 1 and Table 2 ) performed on the last 
day the patient receives the study drug, or as soon as possible thereafter. The patient should also 
return for the follow -up visit approximately 7.5 months after the last dose of study drug if at all 
possible. 
Procedures for patients who withdraw prematurely from the study are described in Section 4.4. 
As appropriate, patients should be treated with standard of care following termination of the study.  
Patients with ongoing adverse events or clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results (as interpreted by the investigator) will be mo nitored as described in Section 7.1.2.

Patients Rolling Over from the Pivotal Efficacy Studies for ADA Assessment Only : Not 
applicable.  
4.3. Justification for Key Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria select for patients who meet ICHD -3 criteria for CM  and 
EM ( Classification Committee of the IHS, 2013) . Because headache consortium guidelines 
recommend preventive therapies for patients with CM and patients with EM occurring on more 
than 4 days per month due to the frequency of headaches and high degree of disability, patient s 
will be allowed to remain on stable doses of no more than 2 (patients not rolling over from the 
pivotal efficacy studies) or 1 (patients rolling over from the pivotal studies)  concomitant 
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 80  preventive medi cation  with at least moderate efficacy ( Silberstein et al 2012 ) for the duration of 
the study. If discontinuation of preventive medication is clinically indicated by the investigator 
(eg, due to no further need or safety concerns), the medications may be stopped, and the reason must be recorded.  
4.4. Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (in accordance with the applicable country’s acceptance), each patient is free to withdra w from the study at any time . The  investigator also 
has the right to withdraw a patient from the study in the event of intercurrent illness, adverse 
events, pregnancy (see Section  7.2), or other reasons concernin g the health or well -being of the 
patient, or in the event of lack of cooperation. In addition, a patient may be withdrawn from the 
study as described in Section s 3.12, 3.14.4, 5.4, and 7.1.7.  
Should a patient decide to withdraw after administration of study drug, or should the investigator decide to withdraw the patient, all efforts  will be made to complete and report all observations up 
to the time of withdrawal. A complete final evaluation at the time of the patient’s withdrawal 
should be made and an explanation given as to why the patient is withdrawing or being 
withdrawn from the study.  
The reason for and date of withdrawal from study drug treatment and the reason for and date of 
withdrawal from the study must be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto 
the CRF. If a patient withdraws consent, every attempt will b e made to determine the reason. If 
the reason for withdrawal is an adverse event or a potentially clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory test result, monitoring will be continued at the discretion of the investigator (eg, until 
the event has resolved or stabilized, until the patient is r eferred to the care of a healthcare 
professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is 
made). The specific event or test result must be recorded on the source documentatio n and 
transcribed onto the CRF.  
All protocol- specified procedures/assessments  should be performed at the early withdrawal visit 
(see EOT/early w ithdrawal visit in Table 1 and Table  2). Patients who withdraw from the study 
will be asked to return to the clinical site for a follow -up visit approximately 7.5 months after 
their last dose of study drug. Immunogenicity, pharmacokinetic, and safety 
procedures/assessments  will be performed at this visit (see Table 1 and  Table 2).  
A patient should only be designated as lost to follow up if the site is unable to establish contact with the patient after 3  documented attempts via 2 different methods (phone, text, e- mail, 
certified letter, etc.).

675 mg ) throughout this long- term safety , tolerability,  and efficacy study . Patients rolling  over 
from the pivotal efficacy studies who received placebo and will continue receiving study drug in 
the current study and patients not rolling over will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio using IRT 
as follows: 
• Patients with CM will receive sc TEV -48125 at 675 mg (loading dose) followed by 
11 monthly sc doses of TEV-48125 at 225 mg or sc TEV-48125 at 675 mg once every 3 months for 12 months for a total of 4 doses. 
• Patients with EM will receive monthly sc TEV-48125 at 225 mg for 12 months or sc 
TEV -48125 at 675 mg once every 3 months for 12 months for a total of 4 doses 
Study drug will be administered by qualified study personnel as sc injections approximately 
every 4 weeks ( 28 days). The 4- week  period will be determined relative to the planned dosing 
day provided the patient returns to the study center within the tolerance window (±5 days). If the 
patient returns to the study center more than 5 days late, then the 4- week  period will be 
determined from the actual dosing day rather than the planned dosing da y. 
In order to maintain the study blind, all patients will receive 3 injections at visits  2, 5, 8, and 11 
and 1 injection at all other visits  as detailed in Table 4.

 82  The recommended sc injection sites follow the National Institutes of Health Patient Education 
Guidelines of June 2012, which are available in Appendix C  of this document and at the 
following website: http://www.cc. nih.gov/ccc/patient_education/pepubs/subq.pdf.  The suggested 
sites of injection are back of upper arms, lower abdomen/belly/waistline, and front of thighs. At 
each visit, the injections should be given in a different location (eg, not in precisely the same 
place), and study staff member(s) responsible for administration of injections should inspect previous injection sites to ensure that they are free of bruising and tenderness and that proper rotation of sites is performed.  
Study drug should be removed from the refrigerator and allowed to equilibrate at room 
temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before study drug administration.  
A 1.5-mL volume from each syringe in each visit’s kit(s) must be injected sc for dosing to be 
considered complete. The total number of sc injections and their locations will be recorded for each dosing visit. 
5.2. Restrictions 
Medications prohibited before and/or during the study are described in Section 5.3 and in the exclusion criteria (Section  4.2). Restrictions in regard to pregnancy and required laboratory 
values are provided in the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Section  4.1 and Section  4.2, 
respectively) . Restrictions in regard to sexual activity are detailed in the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria (Section  4.1 and Section  4.2, respectively), and highly effective contraception methods 
are reviewed below.  
Highly effective contraception methods include the following hormonal and other methods of birth control: 
• combined (estrogen and gestagen) oral contraceptives, hormone implants, hormone rings, contraceptive patch, and hormone i njectables initiated at least 7  days before 
study drug administration  
• intrauterine device in place for a period of at least 2  months before study drug 
administration  
• barrier methods of contraception: condoms with spermicide for males, diaphragm 
with spermicide for females, and portio cap with spermicide for females  
• vasectomy for male partners of female patients  
There were no additional restrictions in this study. 
In addition, male patients may not donate sperm for the duration of the study and for 7.5 months 
after discontinuation of study drug. 
5.3. Prior and Concomitant Therapy or Medication  
Any prior or concomitant therapy, medication, or procedure that a patient has had within 6 months before study drug administration and up to the end of the study period will be recorded on the CRF. In addition, migraine preventive medication that a patient took within 2  years before 
study drug administration will be recorded.  Generic or trade name, indication, and dosage wil l be 
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 83  recorded. The sponsor will encode all therapy and medication according t o the World Health 
Organization drug dictionary. 
Patients will be allowed to remain on stable doses of up to 1 (patients rolling over from the 
pivotal efficacy studies) or 2 (patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies) 
concomitant preventive migraine medication for the duration of the study provided the 
medication has at least moderate evidence of efficacy as defined by guidelines ( Silberstein et al 
2012) and presented in Appendix A . Patients on preventive medication must be on a stable dose 
for at least 2 months of consecutive use prior to study entry . Alternatively , patients mu st have 
discontinued the preventive medication at least 5 half -lives prior to screening. If discont inuation 
of preventive medication is clinically indicated by the investigator (eg, due to no further need or 
safety concerns), the medications may be stopped , and the reason must be recorded. For all 
patients not remaining on preventive migraine medications, disallowed mediations are presented 
in Appendix B . 
Patients will be allowed to use acute medication to treat a cute migraine attacks, as needed . 
All concomitant medications taken during the study, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal or nutritional supplements, must be recorded with indication, daily dose, and 
start and stop dates of administration. All patients will be questioned about concomitant 
medication use at each visit.
 
5.4. Procedures for Monitoring Patient Compliance  
The investigator will be responsible for monitoring patient compliance. If the investigator or the 
sponsor determines that the patient is not in compliance with the study protocol, the investigator 
and the sponsor should determine whether the patient should be withdrawn. The IEC/IRB should be notified. 
5.5. Total Blood Volume  
The total volume of blood to be collected during this study for each patient rolling over from the pivotal effic acy studies is approximately 164.5 mL, as detailed in Table 5.

 85  6. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
6.1. Primary Efficacy Measure and Justification   
There is no primary efficacy measure.  
6.2. Electronic Headache Diary  
Exploratory efficacy endpoints will be derived from headache variables collected during the time 
period specified in Ta ble 1 (patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies) and Table 2 
(patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies) using an electronic headache di ary 
device. Eligible patients will receive  comprehensive training from site personnel in the use of the 
electronic headache diary  device. Site personnel will also instruct patients on the requirement for 
timely and daily completion of the electronic diary. 
On each day, the patient will be asked to record diary data for the previous 24-hour period. 
Patients may be asked about their performance at work, school, and when doing household 
chores (ie, functional assessments). Patients who report headache on the previous day will answer questions about the headache (ie, the number of hours with headache, presence of 
associated symptoms, and use of acute migraine medications).  Additional details regarding the 
questions patients will answer can be found in the electronic headache diary training manual. 
If a pat ient fails to log in and complete the diary for the preceding day, the patient will be 
prompted to enter the missed day’s information the next time he/she accesses the electronic diary 
provided no more than 48  hours have elapsed since completion of that day. If more than 48 hours 
have elapsed since completion of a diary day, the patient will not be allowed to enter diary information for that day, and it will be considered a missed day. 
Rating of headache severity and duration of headache for each day will be completed in the 
electronic diary. Overall headache duration will be recorded numerically, in hours, as well as number of hours with headache of at least moderate  severity.  
If headache is reported, the headache severity will be subjectively rated by the patient as follows: 
• mild headache  
• moderate headache  
• severe headache  
Patients will also record whether photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting are present, and they will record any migraine medications (name of drug, number of tablets/capsules, and the dose in milligrams per tablet/capsule) taken on each day . 
6.3. Six-Item Headache Impact Test  
The HIT -6 was developed by Kosinski et al (2003)  as a short form for reliably assessing the 
adverse headache impact in clinical practice and clinical research settings. The questionnaire measures the adverse impact of headache on social functioning, role functioning, vitality, 
cognitive functioning, and psychological distress. It also assesses headache severity. The HIT-6 
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 86  has b een shown to be a reliable and valid tool for assessment of headache impact in patients with 
CM ( Yang et al 2011 ). 
Patients with CM will complete the HIT -6 at time points specified in Table 1 (patients rolling 
over from the pivotal efficacy studies) and Table 2  (patients not rolling over from the pivotal 
efficacy studies ). 
6.4. Migraine Disability Assessment  Questionnaire  
The MIDAS questionnaire is a 5 -item instrument developed to assess headache- related disability 
based on lost days of activity in 3 domains (work, household work, and nonwork) over the 
previous 3 months. The total of the scores of the first 5 questions is used for grading of disa bility, 
with scores of 0 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 20, and ≥21 interpreted as disability grades 1 (little or no 
disability), 2 (mild disability), 3 (moderate disability), and 4 (severe disability), respectively. It 
has been shown to be reliable and valid for migraine, with substantially higher scores in migraine 
cases than non -migraine cases ( Stewart et al 1999a, Stewart et al 1999b ). 
Patients  with EM  will complete the MIDAS questionna ire at time points specified in Table 1 
(patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies) and  Table 2 (patients not rolling over 
from the pivotal efficacy studies). 
6.5. Two-Item Patient Health Questionnaire/9-Item Patient Health 
Questionnaire  
The PHQ is a 9 -item questionnaire with each item corresponding to 1 criterion of the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders 4th edition diagnostic criteria for major d epressive 
disorder. Each of the items is scored on a scale of 0 (“not at all”) , 1 (“several days”), 2 (“more 
than half the days”), and 3 (“nearly every day”) based on the frequency of symptoms during the past 2 weeks ( Spitzer et al 1999). The PHQ -2 was developed from the PHQ-9 to rapidly screen 
for depression and consists of the first 2 questions from the PHQ-9. The PHQ -2 and the PHQ-9 
are well -validated measures for detecting and monitoring depression, anxiety, and s omatization 
(Kroenke et al 2010).  
Patients will complete the PHQ -2 at time points specified in Table 1 (patients rolling over from 
the pivotal efficacy studies) and Table 2 (patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy 
studies). If the PHQ- 2 is positive (ie, a score ≥3), patients will complete questions 3 through 9 
[unique questions] of the PHQ -9. 
6.6. Migraine -Specific Quality of Life  Questionnaire  
The MSQOL, version 2.1, is a 14- item questionnaire to assess the impact of migraine and 
migraine treatment on a patient’s quality of life during the previous 4 weeks, which has been shown to be a reliable and valid tool for use in CM and EM ( Bagley et al 2012). The MSQOL 
measures the degree to which performance of normal activities is limited by migraine (Role Function-Restrictive domain comprising 7 items), the degree to which performance of normal activities is prevented by migraine (Role Function -Preventive domain comprising 4 items), and 
the emotional effects of migraine (Emotional Function domain comprising 3 items). Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health- related qual ity of life.  
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 87  Patients will complete the MSQOL at time points specified in Table 1 (patients rolling over from 
the pivotal efficacy studies) and Table 2 (patients not rolling over fr om the pivotal efficacy 
studies). 
6.7. EuroQol -5 Dimension Questionnaire  
The EQ -5D- 5L is a standardized questionnaire that assesses overall state of health. The 
EQ-5D- 5L consist of 2 parts. In Part 1, patients rate their health state in 5 domains: mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood, using a scale of 1 to 5 where 1=no 
problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme 
problems. In Part 2, patients rate their health state on a 100 mm visual analog scale; a rating of 0 
represents the worst imaginable health state, and a rating of 100 represents the best imaginable health state.  
Patients will complete the EQ -5D- 5L at the time points specified in Table 1 (pati ents rolling over 
from the pivotal efficacy studies) and Table 2 (patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies). 
6.8. Patient Global Impression of Change Scale  
The PGIC scale is a validated generic tool for assessment of overall change in the severity of 
illness following treatment. Patients will rate how they describe the change (if any) that their 
migraine/headaches have had in their general quality of life and health status since beginning the treatment in this study on a 7 -point scale where 1=no change (or condition got worse); 2=almost 
the same, hardly any change at all ; 3=a little better, but no noticeable change ; 4=somewhat 
better, but the change has not made any real difference; 5=moderately better, and a slight but noticeable change; 6=better, and a definite improvement that has made a real and worthw hile 
difference; and 7= a great deal better, and a considerable improvement that has made all the 
difference.  
Patients will complete the PGIC scale at t ime points specified in Table 1 (patients rolling over 
from the pivotal efficacy studies) and Table 2 (patients not rolling over fr om the pivotal efficacy 
studies). 
6.9. Work Prod uctivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire  
The generic version of the WPAI questionnaire measures the overall effect of health on 
productivity at work and daily activities. The specific health problems version of the WPAI 
questionnaire allows investiga tors to attribute productivity and activity impairment issues to 
specific health conditions. After the employment status of a respondent is identified, 
3 open-ended questions are asked concerning (1) hours absent from work due to health problems 
(or specif ic condition), (2) hours absent from work due to other reasons, and (3) hours actually 
worked. Two additional questions are included that ask about the impact of health on 
productivity, 1 concerning productivity at work and the other concerning daily activities outside 
of work. The response format of each item of the WPAI questionnaire consists of an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 10 (complete impairment) ( Reilly et al 1993 ).

 89  7. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY   
In this study, safety will be assessed by qualified study personnel by evaluating the following: 
reported adverse events , clinical laboratory test results, vital signs measurements, 12- lead ECG 
findings, physical examin ation findings (including body weight measurements), eC- SSRS scores, 
local injection site assessments, and concomitant medication usage. 
7.1. Adverse Events  
7.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical 
product, regardless of whether it has a causal relationship with this treatment.  
In this study, any adverse event occurring after the clinical study patient has signed the informed 
consent form for this study  should be recorded and reported as an adverse event.  
An adverse event can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severity during the course of this  study, or 
significant worsening of the disease u nder study or of any concurrent disease, whether or not 
considered related to the study drug. A new condition or the worsening of a pre- existing 
condition will be considered an adverse event. Stable chronic conditions (such as arthritis) that are present b efore study entry and do not worsen during this  study will not be considered adverse 
events .  
Accordingly, an adverse event can include any of the following: 
• intercurrent illnesses  
• physical injuries  
• events possibly related to concomitant medication  
• significant worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease under study or other pre-existing conditions (Note: A condition recorded as pre- existing that 
is intermittently symptomatic [eg, headache] and that occurs during this  study should 
be recorded as an adverse event.)  
• drug interactions 
• events occurring during diagnostic procedures or during any follow-up period of this  
study 
• laboratory or diagnostic test abnormalities that result in the withdrawal of the patient 
from the study, are associated with clinical signs and symptoms or a serious adverse 
event, or require medical treatment or further diagnostic work-up, or are considered by the investigator to be clinically significant (Note: Abnormal laboratory test results 
at the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the study or receiving study 
drug are not considered adverse events.)  
• all events of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinemia (defined as AST or ALT ≥3 × the ULN, plus eithe r total bilirubin ≥2 × the U LN or INR  >1.5) or 
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 90  Hy’s Law events require immediate study treatment cessation and reporting as a 
serious adverse event.  Refer to Appendix E  for guidance regarding monitoring 
patients with elevated liver function  tests . 
Migraine exacerbations, including acute headache, requiring headache medications will be collected as part of the efficacy assessment in this study. Migraine exacerbations (including acute 
headache) should be recorded as an adverse event only if the presentation and/or outcome is more severe than would typically be expected from the normal course of the disease in a 
particular patient or if they are severe enough to require hospitalization of the patient, in which 
case they are recorded as serious adverse events.  
7.1.2. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
For adverse event recording, the study period is defined for each patient as the time period from 
signature of the informed consent form for this study  through the follow- up visit (approximately 
7.5 months after the final dose of study drug). Adverse events will be collected at each visit via 
adverse event inquiry. 
All adverse events that occur during the defined study period must be recorded on the source 
documentation and transcribed onto the CRF, regardless of the severity of the event or judged relationship to the study drug. For serious adverse events, the serious adverse event f orm must 
also be completed and the serious adverse event must be reported immediately (see Section  7.1.5.3.1).  The investigator does not need to actively monitor patients for adverse events 
once the study has ended. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient  after the defined study 
period should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, following the procedures described in Section 7.1.5.3.1.  
At each contact with the patient, the investigator or designee must question the patient about 
adverse events by asking  an open-ended question such as, “Have you had any unusual symptoms 
or medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe.” All reported or observed signs 
and symptoms will be recorded individually, except when considered manifestations of a 
medical condition or disease state. A precise diagnosis will be recorded whenever possible. 
When such a diagnosis is made, all related signs, symptoms, and any test findings will be 
recorded collectively as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a serious adverse event, also on the serious adverse event f orm. 
The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable intervals until it resolve s, 
stabilize s, or return s to baseline, or until the patient is referred for continued care to a anot her 
health care professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is made.  
The onset and end dates, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 24 hours), action 
taken regarding study drug, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be 
recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF.  
The relationship of each adverse event to study drug and study procedures, and the severity and 
seriousness of each adverse event, as judged by the investigator, must be recorded as described 
below.

Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 91  7.1.3. Severity of an Adverse Event  
The severity of each adverse event must be recorded as 1 of the choices on the following scale:  
Mild:  No limitation of usual activities  
Moderate:  Some limitation of usual activities  
Severe:  Inability to carry out usual activities  
7.1.4. Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Study Drug  
The relationship of an adverse event to the study drug is characterized as follows:  
Term  Definition  Clarification 
No reasonabl e 
possibility  
(not related)  
 This category applies to adverse 
events that , after careful 
consideration, are clearly due to extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc) or to adverse events  that, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged to be unrelated 
to the study drug.  The relationship of an adverse event may be considered “no reasonable possibility” if it is clearly due to extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the following apply:  
• It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of the study drug. 
• It could readily have been produced by the patient’s clinical state, environmental, or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
• It does not follow a known pattern of response to the study drug.  
• It does not reappear or worsen when the study drug is 
re-administered .  
Reasonable 
possibility  
(related)  
 This category applies to adverse events for which, after careful 
medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, a con nection with 
the study drug  administration cannot 
be ruled out with certainty . The relationship of an adverse event may be considered 
“reasonable possibility” if at least 2 of the following 
apply:  
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug.  
• It cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
• It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction  in 
dose. There are important exceptions when an adverse event does not disappear upon 
discontinuation of the study drug, yet 
a drug 
relationship clearly exists.  
• It follows a known pattern of response to the study 
drug.

 92  7.1.5. Serious Adverse Events  
7.1.5.1. Definition o f a Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes or actions: 
• death  
• a life -threatening adverse event (ie, the patient was  at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occur red); does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death  
• inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, which means that hospital inpatient admission and/or prolongation of hospital stay were required for 
treatment of an adverse event, or that they occurred as a consequence of the event. 
Hospitalizations scheduled prior to study entry will not be considered serious adverse events, unless there was worsening of the pre-existing condition during the patient’s participation in this study.   
• persistent or significant disability or incapacity (refers to a substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an  emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Note: Any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal produc t is considered an important medical ev ent. 
An adverse event that does not meet any of the criteria for seriousness listed above will be regarded as a nonserious adverse event.  
7.1.5.2. Expectedness  
A serious adverse event that is not included in the Adverse Reaction section of the relevant 
reference safety information by its specificity, severity, outcome, or frequency is considered an 
unexpected adverse event. The reference safety information for this study is the Investigator’s Brochure . 
The sponsor’s Pharmacovig ilance Department will determine the expectedness for all serious 
adverse events.  
For the purpose of SUSAR reporting, the version of the reference safety information document at the moment of the occurrence of the SUSAR applies .

To satisfy regulatory requirements, a ll serious adverse events (as described in Section  7.1.5.1) 
that occur during the defined study period (including the protocol-defined follow-up period, 
described in Section 7.1.2), regardless of judged relationship to treatment with the study drug, must be reported to the sponsor by the investigator . The event must be reported  within 24 hours 
of when the investigator learns about it. Completing the serious adverse event form and reporting the event must not be delayed, even if not all the information is available. The investigator does not need to actively monitor patients for adverse events once this study has ended. Serious 
adverse events occurring in a patient after the defined study period should be reported to the 
sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them . 
The serious adverse event form should be sent to the local safety officer (LSO) or other 
designated personnel (a contract research organization [CRO] in a country without a sponsor 
LSO; contact  information is in the Clinical Study Personnel Contact Information section); the 
LSO will forward the report to the sponsor’s Global Patient Safet y & Pharmacovigilance 
Department.  
The following information should be provided to record the event accurately and completely: 
• study number 
• investigator and investigational center  identification  
• patient number 
• onset date and detailed description of adverse event  
• investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to the study drug (no reasonable possibility, reasonable possibility) 
Additional information may include the following:  
• age and sex of patient  
• date of 1
st dose of study drug 
• date and amount of last administered dose of study drug 
• action taken  
• outcome, if known 
• severity  
• explanation of assessment of relatedness  
• concomitant therapy (including doses, routes, and regimens) and treatment of the event  
• pertinent laboratory or other diagnostic test data  
• medical history  
• results of dechallenge/rechallenge, if known 
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 94  • for an adverse event resulting in death:  
− cause of death (whether or not the death is related to study drug) 
− autopsy findings (if available) 
Each report of a serious adverse event will  be reviewed and evaluated by the investigator and the 
sponsor to assess the nature of the event and the relationship of the event to the study drug, study 
procedures, and underlying disease.  
Additional information (follow-up) about any serious adverse event unavailable at the initial 
reporting should be forwarded by the investigational center within 24 hours of when it becomes known to the same address as the initial report.  
For all countries, the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Depar tment will 
distribute the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences form/ extensible 
markup language file to the LSO and/or CRO for local submission to the regulatory authorities, 
IEC/IRBs, and investigators, according to regulations. The investigator is responsible for 
ensuring that the IRB/IEC is also informed of the event, in accordance with local regulations.  
Blinding will be maintained for the people who are involved directly in the study. Therefore, in 
case of a SUSAR, only the LSO and/or CRO personnel involved with safety regulatory 
submissions will receive the unblinded report for regulatory submission; the others will receive a blinded report.  
Note: Although pregnancy is not a serious adverse event, the process for reporting a pre gnancy is 
the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event, but using the pregnancy form (see 
Section  7.2).  
7.1.5.3.2. Sponsor Responsibility  
If a serious unexpected adverse event is believed to be related to the stu dy drug or study 
procedures, the sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify all investigators participating in 
sponsored clinical studies of TEV-48125 and the appropriate regulatory authorities (and 
IEC/IRB, if appropriate).  
In addition to notifying the investigators and regulatory authorities (and IEC/IRB, if appropriate), 
other measures may be required, including the following:  
• altering existing research by modifying the protocol 
• discontinuing or suspending the study 
• altering the process of informed consent by modifying the existing consent form and informing current study participants of new findings 
• modifying listings of expected toxicities to include adverse events newly identified as related to TEV -48125 
7.1.6. Protocol -Defined Adverse Events of Special  Interest  
The following are considered protocol-defined adverse events to be sent to the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety and  Pharmacovigilance Department for evaluation: ophthalmic adverse events of 
at least moderate severity, events of possible drug -induce d liver injury (AST or ALT ≥3 × the 
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 95  ULN, total bilir ubin ≥2 × the ULN or INR >1.5), Hy’s Law events , or events of suspected 
anaphylaxis and severe hypersensitivity reactions. Severe h ypersensitivity reactions will be 
monitored using the diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis as outlined by the 2006 Joint National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network Second 
Symposium on A naphylaxis ( Sampson et al, 2006 [also see Appendix F ]). In the event of 
suspected anaphylaxis, vital signs, including oxygen saturation and respiration rate, will be 
measured. Other assessments will be performed at the discretion of the investigator. 
The process for reporting a protocol- defined adverse event is the same as that for reporting a 
serious adverse event (see Section  7.1.5.3). Protocol-defined adverse events for reporting to 
Pharmacovigilance Department can be either serious or nonserious according to the criteria 
outlined in Section  7.1.5.1. 
7.1.7. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event  
Any patient who experiences an adverse event may be withdrawn from the study or from study drug at an y time at the discretion of the investigator. If a patient is withdrawn because of an 
adverse event, both the adverse events page and termination page of the CRF will be completed at that time.   
The patient will be monitored at the discretion of the investigator (eg, until the event has 
resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a health care professional, or 
until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is made). The investigator must inform the clinical project physician/clinical leader as soon as possible of all 
patients who are being considered for withdrawal due to adverse events. Additional reports must 
be provided when requested. 
If a patient is withdrawn from the study or study drug for multiple reasons that include adverse 
events, the termination page of the CRF should indicate that the withdrawal was related to an 
adverse event. An exception to this requirement will be the occurrence of an adverse event that, in the opinion of the investigator, is not severe enough to warrant discontinuation but that 
requires the use of a prohibited medication, thereby requiring discontinuation of the patient. In 
such a case, the reason for discontinuation would be need to take a prohibited medication, not t he 
adverse event.  
7.1.8. Overdose of Study Drug  
Any dose of study drug (whether the investigational product or placebo), whether taken intentionally or unintentionally, in excess of that prescribed must be immediately reported to the sponsor. When the identification of the study drug must be known, the investigator must follow the procedures outlined in Section  3.8.  
7.1.9. Protocol Deviations Because of an Adverse Event  
If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency, departures from the protocol may be allowed on a case- by-case basis . After stabilization and/or treatmen t has been 
administered to ensure patient safety, the investigator or other physician in attendance must contact the individual identified in th e Clinical Study Personnel Contact Information section  of 
this protocol as soon as possible to discuss the situation. The investigator, in consultation with the sponsor, will decide whether the patient should continue to participate in the study. 
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 96  7.2. Pregnancy  
All pregnancies of women participating in the study that occur during the study, or within 
7.5 months after the last administration of TEV -48125, are to be reported immediately to the 
individual identified in the clinical study personnel contact information section of this protocol, 
and the investigator must provide the LSO and/or CRO with the pregnancy form. The process for 
reporting a pregnancy is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event (see 
Section  7.1.5.3).  
Any female patient becoming pregnant during the study will discontinue treatment . All patients 
who become pregnant will be monitored for the outcome of the pregnancy (including spontaneous or voluntary termination). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of the infant up to 8 weeks of age), including details of birth and presence or absence of any birth 
defect, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, will be reported to the 
sponsor. Any complication of pregnancy during the study and any complication of pregnancy that the investigator becomes aware of after termination from the study will be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event, as appropriate. 
If the pregnancy does not continue to term, 1 of the following actions will be taken: 
• For a spontaneous abortion, report as a serious adverse event. 
• For an elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, report as a serious adverse 
event . 
• For an elective abortion not  due to developmental anomalies, report on the pregnancy 
form; do not report as an adverse event. 
For pregnancies of partners of men participating in the study, the Teva Pharmacovigilance 
Department will determine the procedure to appropriately follow up after notification as 
described  above. All partners who become pregnant and provide appropriate consent to the Teva 
Pharmacovigilance Department will be monitored to the completion or termination of the pregnancy. 
7.3. Clinical Laboratory Tests  
All clinical laboratory test results outside of  the reference range will be interpreted by the 
investigator as belonging to 1 of the following categories:  
• abnormal but not a clinically signif icant worsening  from baseline  
• abnormal and a clinically signif icant worsening  from baseline  
A laboratory test result that has significantly worsened (according to medical judgment) from the 
baseline result will be recorded on the source documentation, transcribed onto the CRF as an 
adverse event, and monitored as described in Section  7.1.2. An adverse event includes a 
laboratory or diagnostic test abnormality (once confirmed by repeat testing) that results in the 
withdrawal of the patient from the study, the temporary or permanent cessation of treatment with 
study drug, or medical treatment or further diagnostic work -up. 
In addition, potentially clinically signif icant values will be predefined by the sponsor for selected 
laboratory parameters and will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan.

7.3.5. Other Clinical Laboratory Tests 
7.3.5.1. Huma n Chorionic Gonadotrop in Tests  
At screening (visit 1) , women of childbearing potential who are not rolling over from the pivotal 
efficacy studies will have a s erum β -HCG test . Urine β -HCG tests will be performed for women 
of childbearing potential at all other time points specified in Table 1 (patients rolling over from 
the pivotal efficacy studies) and Table 2 (patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy 
studies). Any patient who becomes pregnant during the study will be withdrawn. Procedures for 
reporting the pregnancy are provided in Section 7.2.  
7.3.5.2. Follicle -Stimulating Hormone Tests 
Postmenopausal women not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies will have an FSH test 
at screening (visit 1).  
7.4. Vital Signs 
Vital signs (pulse, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body temperature, and respiratory rate) 
will be measured before other assessments (eg, blood draws and administration of 
questionnaires) at the time points detailed in  Table  1 (patients rolling over from the pivotal 
efficacy st udies) and Table 2 (patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies). 
Before pulse and blood pressure are measured, the patient must be in a supine or semi -erect/seated position and resting for at least 5 minutes. The same position and arm should 
be used each time vital signs are measured for a given patient. For  any abnormal vital sign 
finding, the measurement should be repeated as soon as possible. Any vital sign value that is judged by the investigator  as a clinically significant change (worsening) from a baseline value 
will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto 
the CRF, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2. 
In addition, potentially clinically significant values may be predefined by the sponsor for 
selected vital signs (see Section  9.7.2) and, if so, will be documented in the statistical analysis 
plan or other relevant documents (eg, medical monitoring plan). 
7.5. Electrocardiography  
A 12 -lead ECG will be conducted before other assessments (eg, blood draws and administration 
of questionnaires) at the time points detailed in Ta ble 1 (patients rolling over from the pivotal 
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 100  efficacy studies) and Table 2 (patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies). The 
ECGs should be performed after the patient has been supine for at least 5 minutes.  
The ECG s performed during the additional visits for pharmacokinetic sampling (patients not 
rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies only) will be performed in triplicate.   
A qualified physician at a central diagnostic center will be resp onsible for interpreting the ECG. 
ECGs should be performed and transmitted according to the central ECG reading instructions 
provided in the ECG user manual. ECG equipment will be provided to all clinical sites. 
Although the ECG interpretation will be performed centrally, the clinical evaluation remains 
under the Investigator’s responsibility. 
The ECG will be evaluated by the Investigator at the time of recording (signed and dated), and 
the printout should be kept in the source documentation file. When pote ntially clinically 
significant findings are detected by the Investigator, a cardiologist should be consulted for a 
definitive interpretation. All communications and diagnoses should be filed in the source 
documentation file. The Investigator’ s interpretation will be recorded in the CRF regardless of 
the central reading interpretation. Any abnormal findings assessed by the Investigator as 
clinically significant should be recorded in the relevant CRF modules (eg, adverse event, medical history). 
Objective alerts are predefined as described in the central ECG reading manual. In these cases, 
the site and the sponsor will be informed immediately.  
Any unscheduled ECGs must also be submitted for central ECG reading. 
Any ECG finding that is judged by the investigato r as a potentially clinically significant change 
(worsening) compared with a baseline value will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the 
source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF, and monitored as described in 
Section  7.1.2. 
7.6. Physical Examinations  
Physical examinations, including height (to be obtained at the screening visit only) and weight 
will be performed at the time points detailed in  Table 1 (patients r olling over from the pivotal 
efficacy studies) and Table 2 (patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies).  
A complete physical examination will include  the following organ sy stems: general appearance; 
head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; chest and lung; heart; abdomen; musculoskeletal; skin; lymph 
nodes; and neurological. Any physical examination finding that is judged by the investigator as a potentially clinically significant change (worsening) compa red with a baseline value will be 
considered an adverse event, recorded on the CRF, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2.  
7.7. Electronic Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The eC-SSRS will be used to assess the patient’s suicidal ideation (severity and intensity) and behavior ( Posner et al 2011). The eC- SSRS Baseline/Screening version will be completed by the 
patient  at visit 2 for patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies , and the eC- SSRS 
Since Last Visit version will be completed at all other time points, as described in Table 1 
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 101  (patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies) and Table 2 (patients not rolling over 
from the pivotal efficacy studies)  
Any positive findings on the eC- SSRS Since Last Visit version requires evaluation by a 
physician or doctoral- level psychologist.  
7.8. Concomitant Therapy or Medication  
Concomitant therapy or medication usage will be monitored throughout the study. Details of 
prohibited medications are found in Section 5.3.  
7.9. Immunogenicity  
Blood samples for serum ADA assessment will be collected at visits 5, 8, 14 ( EOT/early 
withdrawal visit), and 15 (final visit) for patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies 
and at those time  points as well as visit 2 for patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy 
studies. Blood samples for ADA assessment will also be collected upon observation of any 
severe hypersensitivity reaction (eg, anaphylaxis). See Appendix F  for the clinical criteria for 
diagnosing anaphylaxis . Bioanalytical personnel shoul d be made aware of any anaphylaxis 
occurrence as soon as possible in case an anti -TEV -48125 immunoglobulin E assay is required. 
For patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies for ADA assessment only, blood samples for serum ADA assessment will  be collected at visit 16 (follow -up visit). 
7.10. Injection Site Assessments  
Injection site assessments will be performed immediately and 1 hour after administration of each dose of study drug ( see Table 1 [patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies] and 
Table 2 [patients not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies]) . The injection site(s) will be 
assessed for erythema, induration, ecchymosis, and pain, and severity will be graded according to the following criteria:  
• Injection -site erythema, injection -site induration, and injection- site ecchymosis will 
be graded according to measurements: absent, 5 mm to ≤50 mm (mild), >50 to 
≤100 mm (moderate), and >100 mm (severe). Induration must be assessed by careful 
superficial p alpation avoiding pressuring or squeezing the injection site.  
• Injection -site pain will be measured as summarized in  Table 7.  
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 102  Table 7: Severity of Pain Scale for Injection Site Assessments  
Grade  Assessment  
0 No pain 
1 Mild  
2 Moderate 
3 Severe  
4 Worst possible 
If a patient has severe injection site induration, erythema, and/or ecchymosis and/or grade 3 
(severe) or grade 4 (worst possible) injection site pain at 1 hour after completion of study drug 
administration, the patient will be reassessed at 3 hours after study drug administration and hourly thereafter until the reaction/pain is of moderate or less severity. 
Appropriate treatment may be provided if necessary, in which case it must be recorded as 
concomitant medication.  
Injection site reactions will also be recorded as adverse events as described in Section  7.1. 
7.11. Methods and Timing of Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety 
Data 
All adverse events will be reviewed on a periodic basis by the clinical project physician/medical 
monitor according to the safety monitoring plan (eg, scheduled safety reviews for TEV-48125) 
as interim/preliminary safety databases become available.  Safety data will additionally be 
evaluated periodically and ad hoc (if necessary) in the Product Safety Group.  
Methods and timing of assessing safety data are discussed in Section 3.14. Procedures for recording safe ty data are discussed in Section  13.1, and methods of safety analyses are discussed 
in Section  9.7.2.

 103  8. ASSESSMENT OF PHARMACOKINETICS/ IMMUNOGENICITY/ 
BIOMARKERS  
8.1. Pharmac okinetic Variables  
Sampling for pharmacokinetics will be sparse. Thus, t he TEV -48125 pharmacokinetic samples 
will be analyzed using a population pharmacokinetic approach and will be reported separately to 
the clinical study report.  
Samples from  all patients will be analyzed for TEV -48125 using an appropriate validated 
method.  
8.1.1. Specimen Sampling and Handling  
Blood samples (4 mL) will be collected via venipuncture or indwelling catheter at the time points 
detailed in  Table 1 (patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies) and Table 2 (patients 
not rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies) f or plasma concentration measurements of 
TEV -48125.  
The dates and times of  study drug administration and the date and time of each pharmacokinetic 
sample will be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF.  
For plasma collection, samples will be collected into dipotassium EDTA collection tubes, 
inverted sl owly 6  to 8 times to  mix the contents, and placed on water/ice (~4°C). Blood samples 
will be centrifuged (1500g, ~10 minutes, 2°C to 6°C ) between 5  minutes and 1 hour after 
sampling. If a refrigerated centrifuge is not available, samples should be chilled before centrifugation. Other measures should be taken as appropriate to prevent samples from heating significantly during centrifugation. Separated plasma will be transferred in approximately equal portions into 2 labeled, 2- mL polypropylene tubes (sets A and  B). 
Labels for samples should include study number, patient number, period, nominal collection time, set (A or B), and indication that they are pharmacokinetic samples. Samples will be stored 
at a temperature within the range of -70°C ±20°C in an upright position until they are shipped to 
the central laboratory.  
8.1.2. Shipment and Analysis of Samples  
Plasma samples for all patients will be shipped frozen on dry ice from the investigational center 
to the central laboratory, where they will be stored until ship ment to the sponsor or its designee  
for analysis.  
• Set A samples will be transported (frozen) with a temperature data logger, by 
next-day courier, to the central laboratory.  
• Set B samples will either be sent to the same laboratory as that for set A on a 
subsequent day, by next-day courier, or be retained at the investigational center until 
the study is completed and the clinical study report has been issued (unless shipment 
to another facility is requested by the sponsor).

Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 104  Samples will be analyzed using a validated method. Timing of the initiation of sample analysis 
will be determined by the Teva Pharmaceuticals bioanalytical representative responsible for the 
bioanalysis. Refer to the laboratory manual for additional details. 
8.2. Immunogenicity Testing  
Samples  from  all patients will be analyzed for ADA using an appropriate validated method.  
8.2.1. Blood Sampling and Handling  
Blood samples (5 mL) will be collected via venipuncture or indwelling catheter at the time points detailed in  Table 1 (patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies) , Table 2 (patients not 
rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies) , and Table 3 (patients rolling  over from the pivotal 
efficacy studies for ADA assessment only)  for immunogenicity testing.  
For serum collection, samples will be collected into Vacutainer tubes containing no anticoagulant, and allowed to set at room temperature less than 30 minutes to allow for serum 
separation to occur. Samples will then be centrifuged (1500g, approximately 10 minutes, 2°C to 
6°C). If a refrigerated centrifuge is not available, samples should be chilled before centrifugation. Other measures should be taken as appropriate to prevent samples from heating significantly 
during centrifugation. Separated serum will be transferred in approximately equal portions into 
2 labeled, 2- mL polypropylene tubes (sets  A and B). 
Sample labels should include study number, patient number, period, nominal collection time, set 
(A or B), and indication that they are ADA samples. Serum samples will be stored at a 
temperature within the range of -70°C ± 20°C in an upright position until they are shipped to the central laboratory.  
8.2.2. Shipment and Analysis of Samples  
Serum samples for all patients will be shipped frozen on dry ice from the investigational center 
to the central laboratory, where they will be stored until shipment to the sponsor or its designee  
for analysis.  
• Set A samples will be trans ported (frozen) with a temperature data logger, by 
next-day courier, to the central laboratory.  
• Set B samples will either be sent to the same laboratory as that for set A on a 
subsequent day, by next-day courier, or be retained at the investigational cent er until 
the study is completed and the clinical study report has been issued (unless shipment to another facility is requested by the sponsor).  
Samples will be analyzed using an appropriate validated method. Timing of the initiation of sample analysis will be determined by the Teva Pharmaceuticals department representative responsible for the bioanalysis. Refer to the laboratory manual for additional details. 
8.3. Assessment of Exploratory Biomarkers 
Biomarkers are defined as biological substances that monitor physiological effects, assess drug activity, and predict clinical outcome, safety, and response to therapy.  
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 105  Calcitonin gene- related peptide-containing nerve fibers are prevalent in bone tissue and have 
been hypothesized to be important in the regulation of bone metabolism, response to bone injury, 
and the perception of bone pain. In vitro, CGRP is anabolic to osteoblasts and can inhibit maturation to osteoclasts. Preclinical studies suggest that CGRP antagonism may have benefit in 
osteoarthritis ( Benschop et al 2014) and bone-related pain. In the current study, exploratory 
analysis may be conducted on blood (serum, plasma, and RNA) and urine biomarkers of 
extracellular matrix turnover,  bone formation, and bone resorption.  
In preclinical models, CGRP can promote angiogenesis in ischemia, capsaicin -induced synovitis, 
and neovascularization of tumors. Exploratory analysis will be conducted on endothelial/angiogenic markers to determine if TEV -48125 alters angiogenic markers.  
Calcitonin gene- related peptide is known to act directly on macrophage and dendritic cells by 
inhibiting them from producing inflammatory cytokines and presenting antigens to T cells. It has been hypothesized that CGRP may act as a regulator of the innate immune response. Exploratory 
analysis will be conducted on inflammatory endpoints in blood to examine effects of TEV-48125 
in patients with migraine.  
Based on the known biology of CGRP’s mechanism of action, biomarker assessment will 
potentially inclu de markers of bone remodeling, inflammation, and angiogenesis. M ultiplex 
immunoassay panels will be applied to measure changes in urine, serum, plasma , and RNA 
biomarkers.  
The planned biomarker analysis will be detailed in a separate document, which may be updated 
at a later stage before the analysis to allow updating with new scientific information .  
8.3.1. Pharmacogen omic  Assessment  
A single b lood sample (6 mL) for pharmacogenomic analysis  will be collected from each patient 
who provides consent for pharmacogenomic testing; this sample may be collected during the pivotal efficacy studies (for patients rolling over from Studies TV48125- CNS -30049 and 
TV48125- CNS -30050) or during the current the study. Pharmacogen omic  assessment potentially 
includes the association analysis of both known and unknown DNA and RNA genetic variations. In the current study, known CGRP and migraine- associated genes will be examined to determine 
their association with clinical treatment responses to study drug and their potential to be mark ers 
predictive of migraine severity and progression (eg, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety features or disease susceptibility and severity features). The current list of genes with polymorphisms associated with either CGRP target engagem ent or migraine mechanism of 
action includes CALCA, CALCB, CALCRL,  CRCP,  RAMP, PRDM16, AJAP1, TSPAN2, 
MEF2D, TRPM8, TGFBR2, PHACTR1, FHL5, C7orf10, MMP16, ASTN2, LRP1, APOA1BP, TBC1D7, FU T9, STAT6, ATP5 B, and MTHFR ( Anttila et al 2013 ). The final list of genes that 
may be investigated may be edited at a later time  before the analysis to allow updating with new 
scientific information. Genetic analysis could also include sequencing of the whole genome and/or RNA transcripts, if required.  
Pharmacogenomic assessment will be performed based on study results. Samples will be used for 
investigations related to headache, indications where CGRP pathways are implicated, and indications that may be associated with the risk of he adache or those that are common 
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine

drugs. 
8.3.2. Specimen Sampling and Handling  
Blood samples ( a total of 18.5 mL; 6 mL each for plasma and  serum and  6.5 mL for RNA 
[PAXg ene]) will be collected via venipuncture or indwelling catheter at the time points detailed 
in Table 1 (patients rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies) and Table 2 ( patients not 
rolling over from the pivotal efficacy studies)  for serum, plasma, and RNA biomarker measures. 
Urine will be collected in parallel with blood collection. In addition, a 6-mL whole blood sample 
will be collected at baseline for DNA. Details for  processing and handling of each type of 
biomarker sample will be outlined in the laboratory manual.  
All blood and urine tubes will be labeled with the patient coded number. Following DNA 
extraction from pharmacogenomic sample, the sample will be labeled with a new code 
(ie, double coding), so that genetic data will not be recorded having a patient number.  
Samples will be stored for a period of up to 15 years from the last patient last visit in the main study and then destroyed. 
8.3.3. Shipment and Analysis of Samples  
Biomarker samples for serum, plasma, RNA, and urine will be stored at –70°C and sent to the 
central laboratory on dry ice, per instructions in the laboratory manual. Sample labels should 
include study number, patient randomization number, visit code, collection date and time, and 
indication that they are biomarker samples. Shipments should be made as specified in laboratory manual. An electronic file containing sample demographics will be e- mailed to the respective 
biomarker laboratory and the sponsor’s biomarker representative for each shipment. 
Following DNA extractions of whole blood, the samples will be stored at –70°C and labeled 
with a new code (ie, double coding), so that genomic data will not be recorded with a patient number. Data will be kep t confidential and stored separately.  
The biomarker sample analyses will be performed if and when required. Since new techniques continue to be developed, the method and laboratory that will be recommended for the future biomarker analysis cannot be anticipated.  
8.4. Methods and Timing of Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Clinical 
Pharmacology Data 
Methods and timing of assessing clinical pharmacology data are discussed in Section 3.14. 
Procedures for recording clini cal pharmacology data are discussed in Section  13.1, and methods 
of analyses are discussed in Section  9.5.4.

and maximum) will be provided. For categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will 
be provided. Categories for missing data will be presented if necessary. 
9.5. Efficacy Analysis  
Individuals with CM often complain of continuous levels of very low severity headache, which 
is typically not modified during the earlier stages of treatment. Accordingly, and following the Classification Committee of the IHS guidelines ( Silberstein et al 2008 ), headache days of at least 
moderate severity for both CM and EM patients will be defined for the purpose of this study as a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) when the patient reports: 
• a day with headache pain that lasts ≥4 hours with a peak severity of at least moderate severity  
or 
• a day when the patient used an acute migraine- specific medication ( triptans or ergots) 
to treat a headache of any severity or duration  
Migraine day is endorsed based on the same criteria as described in the pivotal studies. For CM 
patients, a migraine day is endorsed when at least 1 of the following situations occur: 
• a calen dar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating ≥4 consecutive hours of a headache 
meeting criteria for migraine with or without aura  
• a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating ≥4 consecutive hours of a headache 
meeting criteria for probable migraine, a migraine s ubtype where only 1 migraine 
criterion is missing  
• a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating a headache of any duration that was 
treated with migraine -specific medications (triptans and ergot compounds) 
For EM patients , a migraine day is endorsed when at least 1 of the following situations occur:  
• a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating ≥ 2 consecutive hours of a headache 
meeting criteria for migraine with or without aura  
• a calendar day (0:00 to 23:59) demonstrating ≥ 2 consecutive hours of a headache 
meeting criteria for probable migraine, a migraine subtype where only 1  migraine 
criterion  is missing

 114  10. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
The medical experts, study monitors, auditors, IEC/IRB, and health authority inspectors (or their 
agents) will be given direct access to source data and documentation (eg, medical charts/records, 
laboratory test results, printouts, and videotapes) for source data verification, provided that patient confidentiality is maintained in accordance with local requirements.  
The investigator must main tain the original records (ie, source documents) of each patient’s data 
at all times. Examples of source documents are hospital records, office visit records, examining physician’s finding or notes, consultant’s written opinion or notes, laboratory reports, drug 
inventory, study drug label records, diary data, protocol-required worksheets, and CRFs that are 
used as the source (see Section  3.13).  
The investigator will maintain a confidential patient identification list that allows the 
unambiguous identification of each patient. All study-related documents must be kept until 
notification by the sponsor.

 115  11. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
11.1. Protocol Amendments and Protocol Deviations and Violations  
11.1.1. Protocol Amendmen ts 
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opinion of a written amendment by the IEC/IRB and national and local 
competent authorities , as applicable, except when necessary to address immediate safety 
concerns to the patients, or when the change involves only nonsubstantial logistics or 
administration. The principal investigator at each investigational center, the coordinating investigator (if applicable), and the sponsor will sign the protocol amendment.  
11.1.2. Protocol Viol ations 
Any deviation from the protocol that affects, to a significant degree, (a) the safety, physical, or 
mental integrity of the subjects of the study and/or (b) the scientific value of the study will be 
considered  a protocol violation. Protocol violations may include nonadherence on the part of the 
patient, the investigator, or the sponsor to protocol-specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
primary objective variable criteria, or GCP guidelines; noncompliance to  study drug 
administration; and use of prohibited medications. Protocol violations will be identified and recorded by investigational center personnel in  the CRF. All protocol violations will be reported 
to the responsible IEC/IRB, as required. 
When a protocol violation is reported, the sponsor will determine whether to discontinue the 
patient from the study or permit the patient to continue in the study, with documented approval from the medical expert . The decision will be based on ensuring the safety of the patient and 
preserving the integrity of the study.  
Changes in the inclusion  and exclusion criteria of the protocol are not  prospectively granted by 
the sponsor. If investigational center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol 
inclusion and exclusion criteria was entered in a study, they must immediately inform the 
sponsor of the protocol violation. If such patient has already completed the study or has withdrawn early, no action will be taken but the violation will be recorded. 
11.2. Inform ation to Study Personnel  
The investigator is responsible for giving information about the study to all staff members involved in the study or in any element of patient management, both before starting the study and during the course of the study (eg, when new staff members become involved). The investigator 
must assure that all study staff members are qualified by education, experience, and training to 
perform their specific responsibilities. These study staff members must be listed on the investigational c enter authorization form, which includes a clear description of each staff 
member’s responsibilities. This list must be updated throughout the study, as necessary. 
The study monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study staff, including t he 
investigator, and for ensuring that they comply with the protocol. Additional information will be 
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 116  made available during the study when new staff members become involved in the study and as 
otherwise agreed upon with either the investigator or the study monitor. 
11.3. Study Monitoring  
To ensure compliance with GCP guidelines, the study monitor or representative is responsible for ensuring that patients have signed the informed consent form and the study is conducted 
according to applicable standard operating procedures (SOPs), the protocol, and other written 
instructions and regulatory guidelines. 
The study monitor is the primary association between the sponsor and the investigator. The main 
responsibilities of the study monitor(s) are to visit the investigator before, during, and after the 
study to ensure adherence to the protocol, that all data are correctly and completely recorded and reported, and that informed consent is obtained and recorded for all patients before they 
participate in the study and when changes to the consent form are warranted, in accordance with 
IEC/IRB approvals. 
The study monitor(s) will contact the investigator and visit the investigational center at regular 
intervals throughout the study. The study monitor will be permitted to check and verify the 
various records (CRFs and other pertinent source data records, including specific electronic source documentation [see Section  3.13]) relating to the study to verify adherence to the protocol 
and to ensure the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data being recorded. If electronic CRFs are used for the study, the study monitor will indicate verification by electronically applying source document verification flags to the CRF and will ensure that all required electronic signatures are being implemented accordingly.  
As part of the supervision of study progress, other sponsor personnel may, on request, accompany the study monitor on visits to the investigational center. The investigator and 
assisting staff must agree to cooperate with the study monitor to resolve any problems, errors, or 
possible misunderstandings concerning the findings detected in the course of these monitoring 
visits and/or provided in follow-up written communication. 
11.4. Clinical Product Complaints 
A clinical product complaint is defined as a problem or potential problem with the physical 
quality or characteristics of clinical drug supplies and/or clinical device supplies used in a 
clinical research study sponsored by Teva. Exampl es of a product complaint include, but are not 
limited to, the following:  
• suspected contamination 
• questionable stability (eg, color change, flaking, crumbling, etc) 
• defective components  
• missing or extra units (eg, primary container is received at the site  with more or less 
than the designated number of units inside) 
• incorrect packaging or incorrect or missing labeling/labels  
• unexpected or unanticipated taste or odor (or both) 
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 117  • device not working correctly or appears defective in some manner 
Each investigati onal center will be responsible for reporting a possible clinical product complaint 
by completing the Product Complaint Form provided by Teva and emailing it to 
 within 48 hours of becoming aware of the issue. 
For co mplaints involving a device or other retrievable item, it is required that the device (or 
item) be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. For complaints 
involving a drug product, all relevant samples (eg, the remainder of the patient’s drug supply) 
should be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible.  
11.4.1. Product Complaint Information Needed from the Investigational Center  
In the event that the Product Complaint Form cannot be completed, the investigator will obtain 
the following information, as available: 
• investigational center number and principal investigator name  
• name, phone number, and address of the source of the complaint  
• clinical protocol number 
• patient identifier (patient study number) and corresponding visit numbers, if 
applicable  
• patient number, bottle, and kit numbers (if applicable)  
• product available for return (yes, no) 
• product was taken or used according to protocol (yes, no) 
• description or nature of complaint 
• associated serious adverse ev ent (yes, no) 
• clinical supplies unblinded (yes, no) 
• date and name of person receiving the complaint  
Note: Reporting a complaint must not be delayed because not all the required information can be immediately obtained. Known information must be immediately  reported. The sponsor will 
collaborate with the investigator to obtain any outstanding information. 
11.4.2. Handling the Study Drug at the Investigational Center  
The investigator is responsible for retaining the product in question in a location separate from 
the investigator’s clinical study supplies. The sponsor may request that the investigator return the product for further evaluation and/or analysis. If this is necessary, the clinical study monitor or designee will provide the information needed for returning the study drug. 
If it is determined that the investigational center must return all of the study drug, the sponsor 
will provide the information needed to handle the return. 
The integrity of the randomization code and corresponding blinded clinical supplie s will be 
maintained whenever possible. A serious adverse event or the potential for a product quality 

 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 118  problem existing beyond the scope of the complaint may be a reason to unblind the clinical 
supplies for an affected patient. 
11.4.3. Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Product Complaint  
If there is an adverse event or serious adverse event, the protocol should be followed. 
11.4.4. Documenting a Product Complaint  
The investigator will record a description of the product complaint in the source documentation 
as well as any actions taken to resolve the complaint and to preserve the safety of the patient. 
Once the complaint has been investigated by the sponsor and the investigator, if necessary, an event closure letter may be sent to the investigational center where the complaint originated or to all investigational centers using the product.  
11.5. Audit and Inspection 
The sponsor may audit the investigational center to evaluate study conduct and compliance with protocols, SOPs, GCPs, and applicable regulatory requirements. The sponsor’s Global Clinical 
Quality Assurance department, independent of the Global Clinical Development department, is 
responsible for determining the need for (and timing of) an investigational center audit. 
The investigator must accept that regulatory authorities, and sponsor representatives may 
conduct inspections to verify compliance with GCP guidelines.

 119  12. ETHICS 
Details of compliance with regulatory guidances and applicable laws are provided in Section  1.6. 
12.1. Informed Consent  
The investigator, or a qualified person designated by the investigator, should fully inform the 
patient of all pertinent aspects of the study, including the written information approved by the 
IEC/IRB. All written and/or ora l information about the study will be provided in a language as 
nontechnical as practical and understood by the patient. The patient should be given ample time 
and opportunity to inquire about details of the study and to decide whether or not to participat e in 
the study. The above should be detailed in the source documentation. 
Written informed consent will be obtained from each patient before any study- specific 
procedures or assessments are done and after the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and 
potent ial hazards are explained, according to the IEC/IRB requirements. The patient’s 
willingness to participate in the study will be documented in a consent form, which will be 
signed and personally dated by the patient and by the person who conducted the infor med 
consent discussion. The investigator will keep the original consent forms, and copies will be 
given to the patients. It will also be explained to the patients that the patient is free to refuse entry 
into the study and free to withdraw from the study a t any time without prejudice to future 
treatment . 
Patients will be asked to sign a separate informed consent form if they agree to provide blood 
samples for pharmacogenomic a ssessment .  
12.2. Health Authorities and Independent Ethics Committees/Institutional 
Review Boards  
Before this study starts, the protocol will be submitted to the national/local health authorities and 
to each IEC/IRB for review. As required, the study will not start at a given investigational center before the IEC/IRB and health authority (where applicable) for the center to give written approval or a favorable opinion. 
12.3. Confidentiality Regarding Study Patients  
The investigator must ensure that the privacy of the patients, including their identity and all personal medical information, will be maintained at all times. In CRFs and other documents or 
image material submitted to the sponsor, patients will be identified not by their names, but by an 
identification code (ie, identification number).  
Personal medical information may be reviewed for the purpose of patient safety and/or verifying 
data in the source and transcribed onto the CRF. This review may be conducted by the study

 121  13. DATA HANDLING, DATA QUALITY CONTROL, AND RE CORD 
KEEPING  
13.1. Data Collection  
Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically designed for this study. The data collected 
on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management system (CDMS) that meets the 
technical requirements described in 21CFR Part 11. The CDMS will be fully validated to ensure 
that it meets the scientific, regulatory, and logistical requirements of the study before it is used to capture data from this study. Before using the CDMS, all users will receive training on the 
system and study-specific training. After they are trained, users will be provided with individual 
system access rights.  
Data will be collected at the investigational center by appropriately designated and trained 
personnel, and CRFs must be completed for each patient who provided informed consent. Patient 
identity should not be discernible from the data provided on the CRF. Data will be verified using the data source by the study monitor, and reviewed for consistency by Data Management using 
both automated logical checks and manual review. All data collected will be approved by the 
investigator at the investigational center. This approval acknowledges the investigator’s review and acceptance of the data as being complete and accurate.  
If dat a are processed from other sources (eg, central laboratory, bioanalytical laboratory, central 
image center, electronic diary data, or ePRO Tablet), the results will be sent to the investigational center, where they will be retained but not entered into the CRF, unless otherwise specified in the 
protocol. These data may also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization performing 
data management) for direct entry into the clinical database. Laboratory test results will not be entered into the CRF, unless otherwise noted in the protocol. All data from other sources will be available to the investigators.  
For patients who enter a study but do not meet entry criteria, at a minimum, data for screen failure reason, demography, and adverse events from the time of informed consent will be entered into the CRF. 
13.2. Data Quality C ontrol  
Data Management is responsible for the accuracy, quality, completeness, and internal consistency of the data from this study. Data handling, including data quality control (QC) , will 
comply with international regulatory guidelines, including ICH GCP guidelines. Data 
management and control processes specific to this study, along with all steps and actions taken 
regarding data management and data QC, will be described in a data management plan.  
Case report forms received will be processed and reviewed for completeness, consistency, and 
the presence of mandatory values. Applicable terms will be coded according to the coding 
conventions for this study. Logical checks will be implemented to ensure data quality and accuracy. Any necessary changes will be made in the clinical database, and data review and 
validation procedures will be repeated as needed. Data from external sources will be compared 
with the information available in the CDMS . Discrepancies found will be queried. 
 Long -Term Study –Chronic and Episodic Migraine 
Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 122  Data corrections in the CDMS will be made using the CDMS update function. The system 
requires a reason for each change and keeps a complete audit trail of the data values, dates and 
times of modifications, and authori zed electronic approvals of the changes.  
At the conclusion of the study, the CDMS and all other study data will be locked to further 
additions or corrections. Locking the study data represents the acknowledgement that all data 
have been captured and confir med as accurate.  
13.3. Archiving of Case Report Forms and Source Documents  
13.3.1. Sponsor Responsibilities  
The sponsor will have final responsibility for the processing and QC  of the data. Data 
management oversight will be carried out as described in the sponsor’s SOP s for clinical studies.  
Day-to-day data management tasks for this study are delegated to a CRO , and these functions 
may be carried out as described in the SOPs for clinical studies at that organization. These SOPs 
will be reviewed by the sponsor before the start of data management activities. The original 
CRFs will be archived by the sponsor. Center-specific CRFs will be provided to the respective investigational centers for archiving.   
13.3.2. Investigator Responsibilities  
The investigator must maintain all writte n and electronic records, accounts, notes, reports, and 
data related to the study and any additional records required to be maintained under country, state/province, or other local laws, including, but not limited to, the following :  
• full case histories  
• signed informed consent forms 
• patient identification lists  
• CRF s for each patient on a per -visit basis  
• data results from other sources (eg, central laboratory, bioanalytical laboratory, 
central image center, and electronic diary data)  
• safety reports  
• financial disclosure reports/forms 
• reports of receipt, use, and disposition of the study drug 
• copies of all correspondence with sponsor, the IRB/IEC, and any regulatory authority 
The investigator will retain all records related to the study until the CRO or sponsor sends 
written notification that records may be destroyed. If, after 10 years from study completion, or 
earlier (in the case of the investigative center closing or going out of business), the investigator reasonably determines that study record retention has become unduly burdensome, and sponsor 
has not provided written notification of destruction, then the investigator may submit a written request to sponsor at least sixty 60 days before any planned disposition of study records. Upon receipt of such request, the sponsor may make arrangements for appropriate archival or

Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 124  14. FINANCING AND INSURANCE  
A separate clinical study agreement, including a study budget, will be entered into between each 
principal investigator and the sponsor (or the CRO designated by the sponsor) before the study 
drug is delivered. 
This clinical study is insured in accordance with the corresponding local legal provisions. The 
policy coverage is subject to the full policy terms, conditions, extensions, and exclusions. 
Excluded from the insurance cover are inter alia, damages to health, and worsening of previous existing disease that would have occurred or continued if the patient had not taken part in the clinical study.  
The policy of Clinical Trials Insurance will be provided to the investigational centers by the sponsor. 
For covered clinical studies (see 21CFR54), the investigator will provide the sponsor with 
financial information required to complete Form FDA 3454. Each investigator will notify the sponsor of any relevant changes during the conduct of the study and for 1 year after the study has 
been completed.

 129  17. SUMMARY OF CHANGE S TO PROTOCOL 
17.1. Amendment 01  Dated 30 March 2016  
The primary reason s for this amendment are as follows:  
• To incorporate required revisions based on health authority input from the European 
Medicines Agency , FDA, and Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency  
• To provide clarifying language for the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
• To clarify allowed and disallowed preventive medications  
• To revise protocol-defined adverse events of special interest  and to add clinical 
criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis  
• To update and/or clarify versions of certain exploratory endpoints, including the 
EQ-5D (now -5L) and PGIC, respectively 
This revision is considered to be substantial by the sponsor’s Authorized Representative. Other nonsubstantial revisions have been made to the protocol (and protocol synopsis, as appropriate). These changes are unlikely to affect to a significant degree the safety or rights (physical or mental integrity) of the patients in the clinical study or the scientific value of the clinical study.  
Where indicated , Table 1 (Study  Procedures and Assessments  for Patients Rolling Over from the 
Pivotal Efficacy Studies ) and Table 2 (Study Procedures and Assessments for Patients Not 
Rolling Over from the Pivotal Efficacy Studies ) have been revised to reflect changes described 
below.

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Rate  Method of Blinding and Randomization  
The sponsor, investigators, study staff (except for staff 
involved in bioanalytical analyses), and patients will be 
blinded to treatment assignment.  The Sponsor will be 
unblinded when the pivotal efficacy studies have been 
unblinded. A computer- generated master randomization list 
will be provided to drug packaging facilities.  The sponsor, investigators, study staff (except 
for staff involved in bioanalytical analyses), 
and patients will be blinded to treatment assignment. A computer- generated master 
randomization list will be provided to drug 
packaging facilities.  The sentence was included in

Study Drug Dose, Mode of Administration, and Administration Rate  
Prefilled syringes (active or placebo) will be contained in uniquely numbered kits and stored (refrigerated at 2°C to 
8°C) on site. Active syringes will contain 150 mg/mL of TEV -48125, and placebo syringes will contai n the same 
vehicle and excipients as those for active injections. Each kit will contain 1 prefilled syringe. All study drugs will be 
administered by a qualified clinic staff member separate from 
the staff member(s) responsible for collecting safety and 
efficacy information from the patients.  Prefilled syringes (active or placebo) will be 
contained in uniquely numbered kits and

 133  1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
1.1 Introduction (Other sections affected by this change: Section 16)  
However, approximately  3% to 6%  of individuals with EM 
evolve, in any given year, to a significantly more disabling 
condition called chronic migraine (CM) ( Bigal et al 2008, 
Lipton et al 2007 , Scher et al 2003). Individuals with CM 
present with headaches of any severity on 15 or more days per 
month and have full-blown migraine on at least 8 days per 
month ( Classification Committee of the IHS, 2013). A 
sizable proportion of individuals with CM experience s daily 
headaches and, therefore, face s considerable disability (Bigal 
and Lipton 2008).  
[…] 
Calcitonin gene -related peptide (CGRP) is a well -studied 
neuropeptide found at the centers of the migraine processes, 
both centrally and peripherally (Eftekhari and Edvinsson 2010, Olesen  2011).  However, approximately 3% of individuals 
with EM evolve, in any given year, to a significantly more disabling condition  called 
chronic migraine (CM) (Bigal et al 2008, Lipton et al 2007, Scher et al 2003). 
Individuals with CM present with headaches 
of any severity on 15 or more days per month and have full-blown migraine on at least 8 
days per month (Classification Committ ee of 
the IHS, 2013). A sizable proportion of 
individuals with CM experiences daily 
headaches and, therefore, faces considerable 
disability (Bigal and Lipton 2008). 
[…] 
Calcitonin gene -related peptide (CGRP) is a 
well-studied neuropeptide found at the cent ers 
of the migraine processes, both centrally and 
peripherally (Eftekhari and Edvinsson 2010). Update/correction of 
information and associated literature on evolution of EM to 
CM was made. 
 
Revision of other select 
literature cited  was made here 
and throug hout the document . 
Although there are more than 40 medications within these 
classes of drugs that are used with varying response rates to 
prevent migraine, only  5 marketed drugs are approved by 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United 
States (US) for the preventive treatment of migraine; 4 of 
them are approved for the prophylaxis of migraine: 
propranolol, timolol maleate, divalproex sodium, and 
topiramate. The clinical trials (Brandes et al 2004, Klapper 1997, Mathew et al 1995, Nadelmann et al 1986, 
Silberstein et al 2004) that supported registration of these drugs for this indication were conducted before the 
establishment of CM as a single entity and generally 
included patients with headaches on less than 15 days per 
month.  4 (propranolol [In deral®, Akrimax Pharmaceuticals], Although there are more than 40 medications 
within these classes of drugs that are used 
with varying response ra tes to prevent 
migraine, only 5  market ed drugs are approved

treatment of migraine; 4 of them are approved 
for the prophylaxis of migraine: propranolol, timolol maleate, divalproex sodium, and 
topiramate. The  clinical studies (Brandes et al 
2004, Klapper 1997, Mathew et al 1995, Nadelmann et al 1986, Silberstein et al 2004)

1.3.1 Nonclinical Studies  
The inflammation was consideredsuspected  to be the result of 
immune complex formation/deposition from the monkeys’ 
immunogenic response to the drug (TEV-48125) and was not 
considered to be clinic ally relevant . In the  pivotal 6-month 
chronic toxicity study in monkeys following once- weekly sc 
dosing at dosage levels of up to 300 mg/kg/week, achieving high exposure throughout the study, no microscopic findings were noted in any of the organs, includi ng the cil iary 
vessels of the eyes, and the NOAEL of the chronic toxicity study was determined to be the highest dose tested, 300 
mg/kg/week. Thus, it is believed that, in view of the low 
frequency (ie, observed in very few animals) and minimal 
severity, t he finding (perivascular inflammation) that was 
only recorded in the 3 -month toxicity study, and had been 
resolved during the recovery period, is an incidental 
finding.

6.8 Patient Global Impression of Change Scale  
The PGIC scale is a validated generic tool for assessment of overall change in the severity of illness following treatment. Patients will rate how they feel now compared with how they 
felt before receiving study drug on a 7 point scale where 3 is 
“very much worse,” 0 is “no change,” and 3 is “very much 
improved”. Patients will rate how they describe the change 
(if any) that their migraine/headaches have had in their general quality of life and health status since beginning 
the treatment in this study on a 7 -point scale where 1=no 
change (or condition got worse); 2=almost the same, hardly any change at all; 3=a little better, but no 
noticeable change; 4=somewhat better, but the change  has 
not made any real difference; 5=moderately better, and a 
slight but noticeable change; 6=better, and a definite 
improvement that has made a real and worthwhile 
difference; and 7=a great deal better, and a considerable improvement that has made all the  difference.  The PGIC scale is a validated generic tool for

violations, are a subset of protocol deviations that may 
significantly impact the completeness, accuracy, and/or 
reliability of the stud y data or that may significantly affect a 
patient’s rights, safety, or well being. Protocol violations 
include enrolling patients in violation of key eligibility criteria 
designed to ensure a specific subject population, failing to 
collect data necessary t o interpret primary endpoints, 
noncompliance to study drug administration, use of prohibited 
medications, GCP noncompliance, or any other deviations 
that may have an impact on the processes put in place for the 
care and safety of the patients or compromise the scientific 
value of the trial.  
Any deviation from the protocol that affects, to a 
significant degree, (a) the safety, physical, or mental integrity of the subjects of the study and/or (b) the 
scientific value of the study will be considered a protocol 
violation. Protocol violations may include nonadherence 
on the part of the patient, the investigator, or the sponsor 
to protocol -specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
primary objective variable criteria, or GCP guidelines; 
noncompliance to study drug  administration; and use of 
prohibited medications.  Protocol violations will be 
identified and recorded by investigational center personnel 
onin the CRF. All protocol violations will be reported to the 
responsible IEC/IRB, as required. 
When a protocol viol ation is reported, the sponsor will 
determine whether to discontinue the patient from the study or 
permit the patient to continue in the study, with documented 
approval from the medical representativeexpert . The decision 
will be based on ensuring the safety of the patient and

Changes in the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
of the protocol are not prospectively granted 
by the sponsor. If investigational center 
personnel learn that a patient who did not 
meet protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria 
was entered in a study, they must immediately inform the sponsor of the protocol violation. If 
such patient has already completed the study 
or has withdrawn early, no action will be

 178  APPENDIX E.  GUIDANCE ON SAFETY MONITORING  
Guidance  on Monitoring Patients with Elevated Liver Function Tests  
Liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT, and ALP) as well as total and direct bilirubin  will be measured  
(and indirect bilirubin will be calculated)  at each study visit.  
In any case of elevated ALT or AST to a level exceeding ≥2× the ULN (including patients whose 
baseline ALT or AST levels are ≥2× and ≤3× the ULN, who may be enrolled in the study), a thorough medical history and physical examination with a focus on liver disease should be undertaken.
1 In addition, the patient should be instructed to refrain from alcoholic beverages. 
In case of symptoms compatible with drug-induced liver injury during the study, patients will be instructed to return to the study center for an unscheduled visit or to go to the emergency room to 
measure liver enzymes as soon as possible. Solitary elevations of total or direct bilirubin, not 
accompanied by elevations of ALT or AST should be managed according to the discretion of the treating phy sician.  
Elevation of Either ALT or AST to ≥3× ULN  
Confirmation is required prior to study drug discontinuation in cases of elevation of either ALT or AST ≥3× ULN (Note: In cases of elevation of ALT or AST ≥8× the ULN, no confirmation is 
required prior to study drug discontinuation, but the assessments below should be performed). 
The following procedures should be followed: 
• The day in which the abnormal value is received from the laboratory will be considered as day 0.  
• The investigator should repeat the test for confirmation purposes (this may be performed in a local laboratory along with complete blood count [CBC] and 
differential to assess for eosinophilia. In general, in case a blood sample is sent to a 
local laboratory, the following assessments [and ref erence ranges] are mandatory: 
ALT [serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase], AST [serum glutamic oxaloacetic 
transaminase], ALP, total and direct bilirubin, CBC [with differential for eosinophil 
count, separate tube], and INR [separate tube; not to be sent in a confirmatory test]). The investigator should also question the patient regarding symptoms. 
The abnormality will be regarded as confirmed in each of the following scenarios: 
• the baseline value was within the normal range and ALT or AST is still ≥3× the ULN  
• the baseline value was above the ULN and ALT or AST is ≥2× the baseline value  
Additional Tests/Evaluations:  
                                                 
1 Thorough medica l history with a focus on liver disease: p ersonal or family his tory of liver disease; personal history 
of a systemic disease with potential liver involvement; exposure to alcohol, medications (prescription or 
over-the-counter ), herbal preparations, dietary  supplements, recreational drugs, special diets , or environmental 
chemical agents; potential exposure to infectious agents (eg, travel to developing countries, history of potential exposure to blood or blood products, high- risk sexual relations) ; and any a dditional information deemed relevant 
by the investigator.  Physical examination, including signs of chronic liver disease .

Clinical Study Protoc ol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS -30051 
 179  Upon confirmation of the abnormality as noted above, the following additional evaluations 
should be performed and results should be recorded in the CRF: 
• serology for hepatitis A (antibody and immunoglobulin M [IgM] and IgG), B (core 
antibody total, core IgM, and surface antigen), and C viruses (central laboratory) 
• serol ogy for autoimmune hepatitis: anti- nuclear antibodies (titer), anti-smooth muscle 
antibodies, and anti-liver kidney microsomal antibodies (central laboratory); further testing may be required in case of a positive result for hepatitis B or C 
• ultrasound exa mination of the liver and biliary tract at the investigator’s discretion  
• other diagnostic tests/consultations as deemed necessary by the investigator (eg, serology for hepatitis E virus in case of travel to endemic geography)  
• observation and follow-up (to be performed after the abnormality was confirmed as above) 
ALT or AST ≥3× (>3.5× the ULN if the Baseline Value Is >2.5× the ULN) but Less Than 5× the ULN  
In addition to the above procedures required for any elevation to levels >3× the ULN: 
• Alanine aminotransferase, AST, GGT, ALP, total and direct bilirubin, CBC and 
differential (to assess for eosinophilia), and INR should be monitored on days 5 
(±2 days), 8 (±2 days), 14 (±3  days), and 28 (±3 days). On at least 1 of these days, the 
test should be performed centrally. (The INR should be sent to a local laboratory only.)  
• In cases where a local laboratory is used, the results should be recorded in the CRF, 
accompanied by the reference range of the relevant measurements.  
• Should the abnormality (≥3× the ULN in case baseline was within the normal range 
or ≥2×  the ULN in case the baseline value was above ULN but still <5× the ULN) 
persist further, the patient will be followed according to the investigator’s discretion, 
but a blood sample for ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, and total and direct bilirubin should 
be sent to the central laboratory at least once a month.  
ALT or AST ≥5× but Less Than 8× the ULN  
In addition to the above procedures required for any elevation to levels >3× the ULN: 
• Alanine aminotransferase, AST, GGT, ALP, total and direct bilirubin, CBC and differential count (to assess for eosinophilia), and INR should be monitored twice a week.  
• At least for every other measurement, the tests should be sent to the central laborato ry. The rest of the tests may be sent to a local laboratory. The INR should 
always be sent to a local laboratory.  
ALT or AST ≥8× the ULN  
In addition to the above procedures required for any elevation to levels >3× the ULN:

 180  • The study drug should be discontinued immediately, and the early withdrawal visit 
should be performed. 
• For follow- up guidance, please see below section “Follow-Up of Liver Enzymes 
After Stopping Rules Are Met.” 
Stopping Rules  
In the following circumstances, the study drug will be discontinued immediately: 
• any increase in ALT or AST to ≥3× the ULN, combined with INR >1.5× the ULN or total bilirubin >2 × the ULN  
• any increase in ALT or AST to ≥3× the ULN, which is accompanied by symptoms clearly associated with impaired liver function  (eg, vomiting, nausea, fever, rash, 
eosinophilia) and not deemed related to other diseases (eg, vomiting or nausea trigger ed by migraine)  
• any increase in ALT or AST to levels ≥5 but <8× the ULN, which is persistent for ≥2 weeks of repeated measurements  
• any increase in ALT or AST to levels ≥8× the ULN  
• in any case where monitoring of liver enzymes cannot be performed according to the protocol guidance 
Follow- Up of Liver Enzymes After Stopping Rules Are Met  
• A patient who meets the above criteria for discontinuation of the study drug should be 
invited to the site to return the study drug. Early withdrawal visit activities should b e 
performed as soon as possible. 
• Liver enzymes should be monitored until normalization or stabilization of the 
abnormality, according to the discretion of the investigator. 
• In any case, following the early withdrawal visit, the minimal follow -up period wil l 
be 30 days and will include measurement of liver enzymes at least once weekly (may 
be performed in local laboratory, with at least 1 test being sent to the central 
laboratory). 
• Every effort should be made to complete the additional tests/evaluations, as described above.

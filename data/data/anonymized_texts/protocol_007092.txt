Title  Systems Biology of 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 
(PNEUMOVAX®23) and 13 -valent pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine (PREVNAR®13) (HIPC : VAX -003). 
Short Title  System s Biology PPV23  and PCV13 . 
Rationale  PCV13 [13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar ®13)] 
induces better functional immune responses when compared to 
PPV23 [23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 
(Pneumovax® 23)] in older naïve adults. We h ypothesize that this is 
due to intrinsic defects in innate responses that could explain the 
poor immunogenicity of PPV23 when compared to PCV13. 
Therefore, we propose to extensively study innate and adaptive 
immune responses generated after administration of either 
pneumococcal polysaccharide or conjugate vaccines in older adults.

Investigational 
Product(s)/  
Intervention(s)  23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PNEUMOVAX® 
23 or PPV23) (Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ) . 
13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PREVNAR®13 or 
PCV13)  (Pfizer, New York, NY) . 
Study Procedures  Vaccination, targeted physical examination, phlebotomy , urine 
pregnancy test.  
Statistical 
Considerations  At the center of this study is the identification of the generic innate 
signatures and the correlation sign atures of innate immune 
response.  
The generic innate signatures will be identified from both immune 
parameters measured by FACS/Luminex assays and array -based 
gene expression will be measured by microarray experiments. The 
generic innate signatures will b e identified for the treatment groups 
separately.  
The traditional immune parameters and array -based gene 
expression that change after immunization are considered generic 
innate signatures.  
After vaccination, the innate signatures that are correlated with  the 
adaptive immune responses (day 30 OPA titers, day 30 IgG levels, 
day 180 serotype specific avidity indexes, plasmasblasts)  are 
considered correlation signatures of the innate immune responses.

Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
1.1 Background 
Pneumococcal diseases are a major public health problem, globally. According to the World 
Health Organization, invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) are responsible for 1.6 million 
deaths per year globally2. In the United States alone, there are four million cases of pneumonia 
each year and the pneumococcus is the most common agent leading to hospitalization3. 
Although all age groups may be affected, the highest rate of pneumococcal disease occurs in 
young children and in the elderly population. In addition, persons suffering from a wide range 
of chronic conditions and immune deficiencies are at increased risk. 
Vaccination is the most effective way of preventing pneumococcal infections. Until  
December 2011, only one vaccine was licensed in the United States for adults: 
PNEUMOVAX®23, the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPV23) based on the 23 most 
common serotypes. With its wide serotype coverage, PPV23 is recommended for elderly and 
younger adults at high risk for pneumococcal infections4. The 23-valent vaccine accounts for at 
least 90% of pneumococcal blood isolates and at least 85% of all pneumococcal isolates from 
sites which are generally sterile as determined by ongoing surveillance of U.S. data. Despite the 
high valency of the vaccine and the good vaccine uptake in the US (>70%) among adults, they 
are still 24,000 cases per year of IPD leading to 4,500 deaths among adults>50 years5. Also 
PPV23 does not appear to reduce the much larger burden of nonbacteremic pneumococcal 
pneumonia with 364,000 cases each year among adults ≥ 65 years of age in the United States4. 
This is explained in part by the decrease in functionality (OPA activity and avidity) of 
antibodies in the elderly after PPV236.  
The 7 and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV7, PREVNAR®7 and PCV13 , 
PREVNAR®13, respectively) have been licensed for use in the US for children since 2000 and 
2010 respectively. The 7-valent conjugate vaccine has led to a marked reduction (~84 to 90% )  in 
disease burden events linked to the 7 vaccine serotypes  even in adults due to a “herd 
immunity”  effect from universal vaccination in children <2 years old 5,7. Since December 2011, 
PREVNAR®13 (PCV13) is licensed for adults 50 years and older. When PCV13 is given to older 
adults (age 60-64) who ha ve never received PPV23, it induces opsonophagocytic antibody 
(OPA) titers to shared serotypes in both vaccines, and for most of those serotypes the immune 
HIPC: VAX-003 CONFIDENTIAL Page 18 of 80 
  
Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 responses to PCV13 are significantly greater than those induced by PPV238. A Phase IV trial, the 
Community Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults (CAPITA) is currently 
underway to evaluate the efficacy of PCV13 against vaccine type nonbacteremic pneumococcal 
pneumonia in adults ≥ 65 years of age who have never received pneumococcal vaccines in the 
past9. The trial enrolled approximately 85,000 adults in the Netherlands and efficacy results are 
expected in 2013. 
A better understanding of the innate and adaptive immunologic mechanisms by which the 
elderly respond to both pneumococcal vaccines could determine the best vaccination strategies 
necessary to decrease the burden of disease associated with increase age. Defining the generic 
innate immune signatures of existing pneumococcal vaccines will allow more rapid and reliable 
evaluation of new vaccine candidates more suitable to populations at high risk for 
pneumococcal diseases particularly the elderly. Therefore additional early surrogates of 
protection are required to more accurately and rapidly evaluate and predict immune response 
after vaccination in the elderly. 
 In this context, systems biology approaches offer a new approach to compare the global 
architecture of the immune response between PPV23 and PCV13. Systems biology is a biology-
based inter-disciplinary study field that focuses on complex interactions in biological systems , 
using a new holistic perspective. Systems biology offers several so- called “Omic” technologies 
that can provide unbiased and rich information on the physiological state of organisms through 
their molecular profiles. These systems biology approaches are likely to be of value in 
identifying molecular signatures that are induced rapidly after vaccination and that correlate 
with, and predict, the later development of protective immune responses. Such a strategy 
would be particularly useful when evaluating the efficacy or immunogenicity of suboptimal 
vaccines, or in identifying individuals who are likely to respond sub-optimally to vaccination, 
such as the elderly receiving PPV23 in particular. Furthermore, the predictive signatures would 
highlight new correlates of protective immunity and stimulate the formulation and validation 
of new hypotheses on the biological mechanisms by which such molecular signatures modulate 
vaccine-induced immunity and protection. Despite this promise in identifying molecular 
signatures, they have only recently been applied to vaccinology10, 11. 
Accordingly, a key goal of the present proposal is to identify molecular signatures that predict 
the sub-optimal immunogenicity of PPV23 when compared to PCV13 in the elderly . One of the

Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 key systems biology technologies that will be employed are microarray analyses. Essentially, 
blood samples will be isolated at baseline (day 0 prior to vaccination), and at days 1, 3, 7, 14 post 
vaccination, and the RNA from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated and analyzed 
for the expression of mRNAs. The microarray platform will be Affymetrix Human Genome 
U133 Plus 2.0 Array, similar to what we had used previously10. In our previous work on yellow 
fever vaccine10, we identified a gene signature that correlates with and predicted YF-17D CD8+ 
T cell responses with up to 90% accuracy in an independent, trial. A distinct signature, 
including B cell growth factor TNFRS17, predicted then neutralizing antibody response with up 
to 100% accuracy. These findings highlight the utility of system biology approaches in 
predicting vaccine efficacy. 
In summary the proposed study offers an unprecedented opportunity to capture the global 
architecture of immune responses to PPV23 versus PCV13 in the elderly. This is likely to have a 
major impact in t wo areas: (i) the elucidation of unique signatures of innate immune response 
that predict vaccine immunogenicity, and will thus be relevant from a public health perspective ; 
(ii) such unique signatures of innate immune response may illuminate the immunologic defects 
responsible for sub-optimal immunity in the elderly population when using a polysaccharide 
vaccine when compared to a conjugate vaccine. 
1.2 Rationale for Selection of Study Population 
To be able to probe the immune system and better understand the innate and adaptive immune 
responses in older adults to pneumococcal vaccines, 88 healthy volunteers between the ages of 
25-40 and 60-89 years will be randomized to receive either PPV23 or PCV13 in a 1:1 ratio. Both 
vaccines are approved for persons 50 and above. However, we elected to study older subjects 
(60 years and above) because functional antibodies decrease markedly with more advanced age. 
The younger group will include 22 subjects between the ages of 25-40 and will help understand 
the potential effect of age on immune responses to PCV13 and PPV23. Subjects will be recruited 
from the general population of metro Atlanta and enrolled at the Hope Clinic, located in 
Decatur, GA.

The vaccines used in the study will be PNEUMOVAX®23 manufactured by Merck (Whitehouse 
Station, NJ) and PREVNAR®13 manufactured by Pfizer (New York, NY). Subjects in the study 
will be administered 1 dose per label of PNEUMOVAX®23 or PREVNAR®13. Study vaccines 
will be purchased from the manufacturers or their distributors. 
1.4 Rationale for Selection of Investigational 
Product(s)/Intervention(s) and Regimen 
Both vaccines will be tested and compared to better understand the innate and adaptive 
immune responses of polysaccharide and conjugate pneumococcal vaccines in the elderly.  
1.5 IMMUNE RESPONSE AGAINST PNEUMOCOCCUS AND 
SYSTEMS BIOLOGY EXPERIENCE 
Immunity following pneumococcal disease is directed primarily against the capsular 
polysaccharide of the bacteria serotype involved. Protective immunity is mainly dependent 
upon type-specific, anti-capsular antibodies, although serological correlates of immunity are 
poorly defined. Capsular polysaccharides when incorporated alone into vaccines are recognized 
by the immune system as “T -cell independent anti gens”. The “T -cell independent” responses 
do not develop in children until 2 years of age. Although adequate IgG levels are obtained, the 
humoral response is characterized by a short-lived initial IgM response and the absence of a 
memory response12. In eld erly, these “T -cell independent” responses elicit an a dequate 
quantitative response (by ELISA) but a suboptimal qualitative response (measured by OPA and 
avidity) in vaccine recipients6. Thus, capsular polysaccharides alone are poorly immunogenic in 
the yo ung and the elderly13, 6. 
The limited response to capsular polysaccharides has been overcome by coupling the 
polysaccharide to an immunogenic protein carrier, which can present the antigen as a T-cell 
dependent epitope. The glycoconjugate vaccines are “T -cell dependent antigens” and induce 
antibodies with good avidity 14 (47 to 76% of antibodies remaining bound to the antigen coated-
ELISA well after addition of 0.05M sodium thiocyanate), maturation, isotype switching, as well

Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 as memory formation 15. Other major effects of these vaccines are prolonged mucosal antibody 
expression, interference with bacterial transmission, and herd immunity 5, 7  
Antibody mediated killing of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) by phagocytes is an 
important mechanism of protection of the human host against pneumococcal infections. It is 
thought that opsonophagocytic antibodies reflect in vivo  mechanisms of defense against 
pneumococcal infection. Measurement of opsonophagocytic antibodies (functional antibody 
assay) using a standardized opsonophagocytic assay (OPA) is important for the evaluation of 
candidate vaccines4 and a requirement for the licensure of new pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
formulations in infant populations. The measurement of functional antibodies has been shown 
to better correlate with protection in infant populations and it is also likely to be a better 
indicator for elderly populations than the measurement of antibodies specific to the capsular 
polysaccharides by ELISA (antibody binding assay). 
Although vaccination with PPV23 provides some protection against invasive pneumococcal 
disease in a healthy elderly population, there is evidence that vaccine efficacy declines with age 
16, and with associated co-morbidities4. The decrease in efficacy could be associated with the 
impairment in the functional quality of the response. Even with advanced age, individuals seem 
to retain the ability to quantitatively respond to PPV (measured by ELISA). However, the ability 
to elicit a functional antibody response (measured by opsonophagocytic assay (OPA) is reduced 
with advanced age 6, 17. 
In a randomized study comparing PCV13 to PPV23 in pneumococcal vaccine naïve subjects 
between the ages of 60 to 64 years, the GMTs for 10 of the 12 serotypes common to both 
vaccines were higher in the PCV13 group, and were statistically significant higher for 8 of the 12 
serotypes8. In a previous randomized study comparing PCV7 to PPV23 in pneumococcal 
vaccine naïve subjects ≥70 years of age, OPA GMTs were significantly higher in the PCV7 group 
for 5 of the 7 common serotypes18.  
Data on innate immunity to PCV13 and to PPV23 are limited. Sen et al.19 have shown tha t 
PPV23 contains both TLR2 and TLR4 ligands. Our preliminary in vitro data show that PPV23 
signals via TLR2 and TLR9 and activates human CD11c+ myeloid DC precursors to secrete 
several cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-12p40, TNF and IL-8. Interestingly MCP-1, 
a chemokine involved in recruitment of many inflammatory cells including monocytes, was not

Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 induced. In contrast, monocytes only produced IL-8 to PPV23. These results suggest that PPV23 
induces distinct cytokine profiles from different subsets of antigen presenting cells.  
A better knowledge of the innate immunity is crucial to understand the immunologic 
mechanisms of response to PPV23 and PCV13 vaccines.

1.6 Risks 
1.6.1 Risks of Investigational Product(s)/Intervention(s) 
Pneumococcal polys accharide vaccine is recommended for all adults aged ≥65 years and those 
adults aged 19-64 years with underlying medical conditions that put them at greater risk for 
serious pneumococcal infection 20. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
will continue to review evidence as it becomes available to guide development of a 
recommendation regarding routine use of PCV13 in adults aged 50 years and older21 . Eleven 
immunocompetent subjects between the ages of 25-40 will receive PPV23 without an indication. 
Safety concerns in this group are not anticipated on the basis of previous safety data generated 
in young adults vaccinated with pneumococcal vaccines with lower valency (6 and 12) which 
was used to support the licensure of PPV2321a .Additionally, the safety profile is not expected to 
differ between young adults without co-morbidities and adults with a medical indication to 
receive PPV23. 
PNEUMOVAX®23, manufactured by Merck (Whitehouse Station, NJ), is indicated for 
vaccination against pneumococcal disease caused by those pneumococcal types included in the 
vaccine. The most common adverse experiences reported in >10% of subjects vaccinated with 
PNEUMOVAX®23 in clinical trials were: local reaction at injection site including 
pain/soreness/tenderne ss, erythema, swelling/induration and systemic reaction, mostly with 
asthenia/fatigue, myalgia and headache.  
  
HIPC: VAX-003 CONFIDENTIAL Page 23 of 80 
  
Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 Other Adverse reactions identified during post approval use of PNEUMOVAX 23 include:  
Guillain-Barré syndrome,  radiculoneuropathy, seizure, angioneurotic edema, cellulitis, nausea, 
vomiting, arthralgia, arthritis, limb mobility decreased, paresthesia, weakness, anaphylactoid 
reaction, lymphadenitis, serum sickness. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a 
population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or 
their causal relationship to product exposure. 22. 
PREVNAR®13, manufactured by Pfizer (New York, NY), is indicated in adults (50 years or 
older) for prevention of pneumonia and invasive disease caused by those pneumococcal types 
included in the vaccine. In adults aged 50 years and older solicited adverse reactions reported in 
>10% of subjects vaccinated with PREVNAR®13 were: pain at the injection site (>50%), fatigue 
(>30%), headache (>20%), muscle pain (>20%), joint pain (>10%), decreased appetite (>10%), 
injection site redness (>10%), injection site swelling (>10%) and  limitation of arm movement 
(>10%)23. In one randomized study comparing safety of PCV13 to PPV23 in 60-64 years old 
previously unvaccinated, the frequency of local reactions was not statistically significant in both 
arms except for pain (more frequent in the PCV13 arm). Also the frequency of systemic 
reactions was not statistically different in both arms except for decrease in appetite, joint and 
muscle pains (more frequent in the PPV23 arm) 23. In 6 studies comparing the safety of PCV13 to 
PPV23, SAE were similar among both groups (around 6% at 6 months post vaccination) 23.  
Eleven immunocompetent subjects between the ages of 25-40 will receive PCV13 without an 
indication. The safety profile of PREVNAR13®  in immunocompetent healthy adults aged 25- 40 
years -including both systemic and injection-site adverse events- is not expected to be different 
than in subje cts ≥ 50 years old. Safety concerns in this group are not anticipated on the basis of 
previous safety data generated in young adults vaccinated with pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccines with lower valency (7). Multiple studies have been published on the use of 
PREVNAR7® in immunocompromised hosts in transplant recipients23a and HIV infected 
subjects 23b with acceptable safety profile. In one study with 25 young adults non HIV infected 
between the ages of 29-46, side effects with PREVNAR7® were mild (98%) mostly involving 
local tenderness, malaise, and myalgia. These side effects occurred within 7 days after 
vaccination and none were severe or life-threatening 23b.

Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 Revaccination with PPV23 is recommended by the ACIP for subjects with functional or 
anatomic asplenia and for persons with immunocompromising conditions20, although, this 
pop
ulation is not eligible for the current study. However, the ACIP recommends that those who 
received PPV23 before age 65 years for any indication should receive another dose of the 
vaccine at age 65 years or later if at least 5 years have passed since their previous dose.  
Persons aged >65 years should be administered a second dose of vaccine if they received the 
vaccine >65 years previously and were aged <65 years at the time of primary vaccination. 
Revaccination with PNEUMOVAX®23 is considered safe although for subjects aged > 65 years 
the overall injection-site adverse experiences rate was higher following revaccination (79.3%) 
than following primary vaccination (52.9%). The rate of vaccine-related systemic adverse 
experiences was also higher following revaccination (33.1%) than following primary vaccination 
(21.7%) in subjects > 65 years of age22. With revaccination there is a potential risk of 
hyporesponsiveness with certain serotypes 24, 25. In both of these longitudinal studies, patients 
were, of course, older at the time of revaccination than at first vaccination and so it is possible 
that some of the differences in the immune response to revaccination were due to an age-effect, 
rather than to an effect of prior receipt of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. 
Ortqvist et al. also show how the responses in the elderly are serotype specific, with some 
serotypes eliciting poorer responses than others26. A recent study by Manoff et al., show that 
both IgG antibodies and functional antibodies persist in persons older than 65 year above 
baseline concentrations five year after primary vaccination and revaccination27. Although the 
responses were slightly lower after revaccination there was no blunting of the responses to a 
second dose of the polysaccharide vaccine. Responses are markedly different in the elderly if 
the polysaccharide vaccine is given after the conjugate vaccine, where there is clear evidence of 
the lack of booster response and possible hyporesponsiveness regardless of the dose of 
conjugate vaccine used for priming 28, 29. In  contrast, immunologic hyporesponsiveness is not 
seen with PCVs, and repeated doses of PCVs can be given to without diminishment of the 
immune response 28, 30.  
However, it should be noted that because the quantity of antibodies that correlate with 
protection against pneumococcal disease has not been clearly defined, it is unknown if the 
lower antibody levels seen on revaccination correlate with inferior protection. There is also the 
added advantage of increased serotype coverage by the PPV23.  Currently, there are no

immunocompetent adults previously vaccinated with PCV13.  
1.6.2 Risk of Study Procedures 
The discomforts of this study include having blood drawn, intramuscular (IM) injection, and 
possible allergic reactions to the components the pneumococcal vaccines administered in the 
study. 
Drawing blood causes transient discomfort and may cause fainting. Bruising at the blood draw 
site may occur but can be prevented or lessened by applying pressure to the draw site for 
several minutes. Intramuscular injection also may cause transient discomfort. The use of aseptic 
technique will make infection at the site where blood will be drawn or where the vaccination is 
given extremely unlikely. Vaccines used in the study will be a single vial dose preventing the 
risk of over or under dosing and the potential risk of contamination when compared to multi-
dose vials. 
In the clinical trials of PNEUMOVAX® 23 22, the most common local adverse events at the site of 
injection were pain/tenderness/soreness (60.0%), swelling/induration (20.3%), and erythema. 
The most common systemic adverse experiences were headache (17.6%), asthenia/fatigue 
(13.2%), and myalgia (11.9%).  All of these adverse reactions were reported at a rate lower than 
10% after receiving a placebo injection.  
In the post-marketing experience of PNEUMOVAX®23, the following additional adverse 
reactions have been identified: Cellulitis, Malaise, Fever (>102°F), Warmth at the injection site,

1.6.3 Risk of Concomitant Medications, Prophylactic Medications and 
Rescue Medications 
We do not anticipate the use of any other medication; however should anaphylactic or 
hypersensitivity reactions occur, an epinephrine (1:1000) and diphenhydramine injections are 
readily available at the Hope Clinic during vaccine use. Epinephrine injection can be associated 
with high blood pressure, arrhythmia, lightheadedness, nervousness, restlessness, tremor, 
shortness of breath and diaphoresis. The frequency of these side effects is not defined. 
Diphenhydramine injection can be associated with low blood pressure, arrhythmia, confusion, 
dizziness, sedation, restlessness, diarrhea, nausea and urinary retention. The frequency of these 
side effects is also not defined. 
Subjects are allowed to use acetaminophen or NSAIDs if they experience a moderate to severe 
local or systemic side effects after vaccine administration. 
1.7 Benefits 
1.7.1 Benefits of Investigational Product(s)/Intervention(s) 
Participants will have the benefit of receiving a licensed pneumococcal vaccine which may offer 
protection against pneumococcal disease. Also the knowledge gained from this study could 
facilitate the design of more effective pneumococcal vaccines for the geriatric population.

Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 2. OBJECTIVES 
PCV13 induces better functional immune responses when compared to PPV23 in older naïve 
adults. We hypothesize that this is due to intrinsic defects in innate responses that could explain 
the poor immunogenicity of PPV23 when compared to PCV13. Therefore, we propose to 
extensively study innate and adaptive immune responses generated after administration of 
either pneumococcal polysaccharide or conjugate vaccines in older adults.  
2.1 Primary Objective(s) 
To analyze the generic innate immune signatures that correlate with  the magnitude of the 
adaptive immune responses (opsonophagocytosis [OPA ] titers)  at day 30 in order to identify 
the correlation signatures of the innate immune responses to PPV23 and PCV13. 
2.2  Secondary Objective(s) 
To analyze the generic innate immune signatures that correlate with the persistence and the 
quality of the adaptive immune responses determined by serological assays to PPV23 and 
PCV13. 
2.3 Exploratory Objective(s) 
To compare the generic innate immune signatures that correlate with the magnitude of the 
adaptive immune responses (opsonophagocytosis [OPA] titers) in elderly and the young in the 
different age strata . 
To compare the generic innate immune signatures that correlate with the persistence and the 
quality of the adaptive immune responses as determined by memory B cells, plasmablasts and 
monoclonal antibodies to PPV23 and PCV13.

MATERIAL(S),  OTHER  STUDY  PRODUCTS  
(CONTROLS/PLACEBOS) 
5.1 Investigational Product(s)/Intervention(s) 
The Emory Investigational Drug Service will purchase PNEUMOVAX® 23 from its 
manufacturer (Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ) and PREVNAR®13 from its manufacturer 
(Pfizer, New York, NY) or their distributors. The Emory Investigational Drug Service will store 
the vaccines and will monitor temperatures of refrigerator containing the vaccines. 
Refer to section 1.6, and applicable product labeling for known and potential risks to human 
participants associated with the investigational product(s) intervention(s). 
5.2 Formulation, Packaging, and Labeling 
PNEUMOVAX® 23 (Pneumococcal Vaccine Polyvalent) is a sterile, liquid vaccine for 
intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. It consists of a mixture of highly purified capsular 
polysaccharides from the 23 most prevalent or invasive pneumococcal types of Streptococcus 
pneumoniae, including the serotypes that most frequently cause invasive drug-resistant 
pneumococcal infections among children and adults in the United States.  
 
 
PNEUMOVAX 23 is manufactured according to methods developed by the Merck Research 
Laboratories. Each 0.5 mL dose of vaccine contains 25 micrograms of each polysaccharide type 
in isotonic saline solution containing 0.25% phenol as a preservative. 
PNEUMOVAX 23 will be supplied as a single-dose vial of liquid vaccine. 
PREVNAR 13®, Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine (Diphtheria CRM197 Protein) is a 
sterile suspension of saccharides of the capsular antigens of Streptococcus pneumonia  serotypes 1, 
3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F, individually linked to nontoxic diphtheria 
CRM197 protein. Each serotype is grown in soy peptone broth. The individual polysaccharides 
HIPC: VAX-003 CONFIDENTIAL Page 36 of 80 
  
Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 are purified through centrifugation, precipitation, ultrafiltration, and column chromatography. 
The polysaccharides are chemically activated to make saccharides, which are directly 
conjugated by reductive amination to the protein carrier CRM197, to form the glycoconjugate.  
The individual glycoconjugates are compounded to formulate Prevnar®13. Potency of the 
formulated vaccine is determined by quantification of each of the saccharide antigens and by 
the saccharide to protein ratios in the individual glycoconjugates. Each 0.5 mL dose of the 
vaccine is formulated to contain appr oximately 2.2 μg of each of Streptococcus pneumoniae  
serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F saccharides, 4.4 μg of 6B saccharides, 34 μg 
CRM197 carrier protein, 100 μg polysorbate 80, 295 μg succinate buffer and 125 μg aluminum as 
aluminum phosphate adjuvant. 
 
Note: No additional labeling of the vaccines will be required

7.1 Enrollment and Randomization 
This research study will be explained in lay terms to each potential research participant. The 
potential participant will sign an informed consent form before undergoing any study 
procedures. Participants who are deemed eligible for the study (see sections 4.1 and 4.2) will be 
enrolled and assigned a unique participant number. Approximately eighteen months are 
needed for enrollment. The duration of participation for each subject is approximately 6 
months. An additional optional blood draw will be offered 2-3.5 years after enrollment. 
Eighty 
eight subjects ( 22 subjects (ages 25-40) and 66 subjects ( ages 60-89)) will be randomized 
to receive PPV23 or PCV13 in a 1:1 ratio. 
7.2 Screening Visit(s) 
Refer to 7.3  
7.3 Baseline Visit(s) 
Interested subjects will call recruiters for a telephone screening where the eligibility criteria of 
the subject will be reviewed. To confirm that participant has never received pneumococcal 
vaccine in the past, vaccination records may be requested from participant’s physician after 
obtaining a release of information from the participant. If the subject is found to be eligible and 
continues to be interested in participating after reading the informed consent (emailed or 
mailed to him/her), an appointment will be scheduled.  
Study staff will review with the subject the study informed consent form and will answer all 
questions related to the study. Once the subject signs the informed consent, a study 
participation number will be assigned and subject will be randomized to receive PPV23 or 
PCV13. The participant will be asked to provide demographic information and information 
related to his/her medical history including current medications and vaccination history to 
verify eligibility . The volunteer’s vital signs will be recorded and a targeted physical exam will 
only be performed if needed based on findings during review of health status. For female 
volunteers of age bearing potential, a urine pregnancy test is obtained. Only females with a 
HIPC: VAX-003 CONFIDENTIAL Page 42 of 80 
  
Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 negative urine pregnancy test will be enrolled in the study. Females of child bearing potential 
will be asked to use effective contraceptive method thirty days before and 30 days after 
vaccination. Blood for immunological assays will be drawn at this visit. For female participants 
aged 25-40 blood for immunological assays will be drawn after results of the urine pregnancy 
test are available and shown to be negative. 
The participant will get the pneumococcal Vaccine Information Sheet and then receive 1 dose 
per label of either PNEUMOVAX®23 or PREVNAR®13 according results of randomization.  
Any Adverse Event (including – but not only- vaccine reactions and local or systemic 
Reactogenicity Events) of grade 3 or higher severity or any SAE occurring after vaccination 
while the subjects is still at the clinical site will be recorded and reported. 
The participant will be provided with a written description of what represents a local and 
systemic vaccine reaction of mild, moderate and severe intensity (Refer to Appendix 3 and 
Appendix 4). Subjects will be instructed to notify the study center by telephone if they develop 
any severe reactions within 1 week following vaccination.  
At the end of the visit, the participant will also be instructed to promptly call the site if he/she 
develops any of the following: 
 becomes sick or has been treated at the doctor’s office or emergency department or has 
been hospitalized for any illness throughout D180 of the study; 
 develops any adverse event that limits self-care activities of daily living (e.g.  bathing, 
dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bed 
ridden) even if he/she decides not to get medical care; or 
 starts or stops any medications/therapies during enrollment in the study. 
 Becomes pregnant.

Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 8.2 Adverse Events 
This section defines the types of adverse events and outlines the procedures for appropriately 
collecting, grading, recording, and reporting them. Information in this section complies with 
ICH Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting and  ICH E6: Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and applies the standards set forth 
in the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
Version 4.0 [Published: May 28, 2009; revised version 4.03; June 14. 2010)] . These criteria have 
been reviewed by the study investigators and have been determined appropriate for this study 
population. 
8.2.1 Definitions 
8.2.1.1  Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is any occurrence or worsening of an undesirable or unintended sign, 
symptom, laboratory finding, or disease that is experienced during participation in the trial. An 
AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporarily 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) Study Agent(s)/Intervention(s), whether 
or not related to the medicinal (investigational) Study Agent(s)/Intervention(s). 
8.2.1.2  Adverse Events Associated with Study Vaccines and Study 
Procedures 
The most common adverse reactions after vaccine administration are fully described in Section 
1.6.1 . 
Adverse events after blood draws may include: 
 Fainting /Vasovagal events 
 Bruising at puncture site larger than 2 cm diameter 
 Bleeding from puncture site lasting more than 30 minutes 
 Swelling at puncture site larger than 2 cm 
 
8.2.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An adverse  event or suspected adverse reaction is  considered ‘‘serious ’’ if, in the view of  either 
the investigator or sponsor, it  results in any of the following  outcomes:  
HIPC: VAX-003 CONFIDENTIAL Page 47 of 80 
  
Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 -Death 
- A life-threatening  adverse event 
- Inpatient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
- A persistent or  significant incapacity or substantial  disruption of the ability to conduct  normal 
life functions 
 -A congenital  anomaly/birth defect 
Important medical  events that may not result in death, be  life-threatening, or require  
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Note: 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘life-threatening ’’ if, in the view 
of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate 
risk of death.  
It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death. 
8.2.3. Unexpected Adverse Event or Adverse Reaction 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘unexpected ’’ if it is not listed in 
the product label information of PNEUMOVAX®23 nor PRENAR®13 or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed.  
For
 example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater 
severity) if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. 
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of 
greater specificity) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. 
‘‘Unexpected, ’’ as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the product label information as occurring with a class of 
vaccine or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the product but are not 
specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.

The ISM is a physician with relevant expertise whose primary responsibility will be to provide 
independent safety monitoring in a timely fashion and to provide recommendations regarding 
the safe continuation of the study.  
The ISM is a physician independent from the study team and will evaluate adverse events, 
including SAE, against the known safety profile of the study product to assess for possible 
changes to the overall risk of the study. Contact information for the ISM and the NIAID Medical 
Officer is listed in page 3 of this protocol.  
The ISM and the NIAID Medical Officer will communicate as needed to discuss any safety 
events of special interest developing during the study and when conducting the review of 
periodic reports of cumulative safety data. The study has provisions for a back- up to ensure that 
independent safety monitoring happens at all times during the study. Additional roles and 
responsibilities of the ISM are described in sections 8.2.7 and 8.3 below. 
8.2.5  Collecting, Recording and Managing Adverse Events 
8.2.5.1  Collecting and reporting Adverse Events 
Adverse events occurring after the subject has signed the consent will be collected and reported 
as follows: 
 Any Adverse Event (including – but not only- vaccine reactions and local or systemic 
Reactogenicity Events) of grade 3 or higher severity or SAE occurring after vaccination 
while the subjects is still at the clinical site. 
 Local REs and systemic REs of grade 3 or higher severity occurring from Day 0 to Day 7 
reported over the telephone by the participant and/or assessed at the clinic. 
 AEs of grade 3 or higher severity throughout D180 of the study (including -but not only 
– AEs linked to blood draws). 
 All SAEs throughout D180.  
Adver
se events may be identified during this study through any of these methods: 
1.  Examination of the participant during study visits. 
2.  Questioning the participant during study visits.

during the study 
 Note: Not all safety events identified may require recording and reporting 
A complete recording of safety events in the CRF will include event term, date of onset and 
resolution/stabilization, assessment of severity, relationship to study vaccine or 
procedures/intervention(s) such as phlebotomy, expectedness, determination of whether the 
AE qualifies as serious, treatment required, action taken with study participation and outcome. 
AEs qualifying as SAEs also require a narrative of the event. Updates in safety events will be 
recorded as additional information becomes available. 
 
8.2.5.2 Managing Adverse Events 
 
The site investigator must apply his or her clinical judgment as to whether an AE is of sufficient 
severity to require that the participant immediately be removed from further treatment under 
the protocol. The investigator must institute any necessary medical therapy to protect a 
participant from any immediate dangers.  
Severe related AEs and all SAEs will be followed until they are resolved.  
Participants who are prematurely terminated from the study due to a safety event will be 
followed until resolution of the AE or until 30 days after a participant terminates from the 
study, whichever comes later.  
Note:  
Resolution of an AE is defined as the return to baseline status or as stabilization of the condition 
with the expectation that it will remain chronic.

8.2.6.1.  Grading criteria 
Adverse events requiring reporting in this study will be graded according to the criteria set 
forth in the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  
(Version 4.03; June 14, 2010 ). 
Adverse events requiring reporting in this study if not listed in the NCI-CTCAE (Version 4.03; 
June 14, 2010) will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following general 
guideline in the NCI-CTCAE manual): 
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-
appropriate instrumental ADL*. 
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; 
limiting self-care ADL**. 
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
Grade 5 Death related to AE. 
*Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL) refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries 
or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. 
**Self-care  Activities of Daily Living (ADL)   refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding 
self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. 
 Anaphylaxis is a disorder characterized by an acute inflammatory reaction resulting from the 
release of histamine and histamine-like substances from mast cells, causing a hypersensitivity 
immune response. Clinically, it presents with breathing difficulty, dizziness, hypotension, 
cyanosis and loss of consciousness and may lead to death. 
Severity grading of anaphylaxis as per the NCI-CTCAE (Version 4.03; June 14, 2010) manual is 
as follows: 
Grade 1=  
Grade 2=  
Grade 3= Symptomatic bronchospasm, with or without urticaria; parenteral intervention

9.1. Sample Size and Power Calculations 
The study is explorative. Not enough preliminary data exists to support accurate calculation of 
the sample size. However we conducted a sample size analysis based on hypothetical scenarios 
and knowledge of similar studies. Based on previous studies performed at the Hope Clinic and 
the Vaccine Research Trials Center, the rate of subjects that become ineligible during the study 
(i.e. do not meet exclusion/inclusion criteria anymore, lost to follow-ups, unable to have blood 
draws) is between 5 to 10%. Assuming 10% attrition rate, 88 subjects will be recruited and 1:1 
randomized into the two treatment groups, resulting in an expected 80 subjects for data 
analysis. The sample size is on-par with similar studies. In the case that the sample size of 
subjects missing any of the 4 draws required for the primary endpoint [meaning draws at days 
1, 3, 7(+1), and 30 (+7)]    is   higher than 10% of the 88 subjects to be recruited for the study, we 
will recruit extra patients to maintain the target sample size of 80 subjects.  
The randomization process will be detailed in the MOP. At the center of this study is the 
identification of generic innate signatures and finding their correlations with the adaptive 
immune response. The generic innate signatures will be identified from both traditional 
immune parameters measured by FACS/Luminex assays and array-based gene expression will 
be measured by microarray experiments. The generic innate signatures will be identified for 
different treatment groups separately.  The traditional immune parameters and array-based 
gene expression that change after immunization are considered generic innate signatures. The 
traditional immune parameters and array-based gene expression  that are correlated with the 
adaptive immune responses (day 30 OPA titers, day 30 IgG levels, day 180 serotype specific 
avidity indexes, plasmablasts also) are considered correlation signatures of the innate immune 
responses.  
Both for sample size consideration and data analysis, we will use different stringency levels for 
the traditional immune parameters and microarray data, because the traditional immune 
parameters are measured with less noise, and a traditional immune parameter is more likely 
than an average gene to be associated with the immune response.  
 
HIPC: VAX-003 CONFIDENTIAL Page 56 of 80 
  
Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 Primary Endpoint 1. 
The innate signatures will be detected in each treatment group separately. A two-sided paired 
paired t-test will be used to test each immune parameter, in order to find immune parameters 
that change significantly over the baseline. As multiple immune parameters are studied, we use 
the alpha level of 0.01 to offset multiple testing. With 30 samples in each treatment group in the 
elderly, we can reject the null hypothesis of equal means with 80% power if the true effect size 
(mean difference/sigma) is 0.66, using a two-sided paired t-test and the alpha level of 0.01.  
For the gene expression, again the innate signatures will be detected in each treatment group 
separately. The actual data analysis will be performed using the method Significance Analysis 
of Microarrays (SAM) with paired design. For sample size consideration, we will consider the 
simpler case of a paired t- test. As the number of genes tested is in the order of tens of 
thousands, we use the alpha level of 0.0005 to offset the effect of multiple testing. This means an 
average of one false positive for every 2000 null genes tested, which is an acceptable level as we 
expect >100 truly differentially expressed genes. In actual data analysis false discovery rate 
(FDR) will be used. With 30 samples in each elderly treatment group, we can reject the null 
hypothesis of equal means with 80% power if the true effect size (mean difference/sigma) is 
0.88, using a two-sided paired t-test and the alpha level of 0.0005. 
 
Primary Endpoint 3, Secondary Endpoints 2&4. 
The correlation signatures will be identified for each treatment group separately. The innate 
signature markers/genes identified in the analysis of Primary Endpoint 1 will be used in this 
step for the identification of correlation signature. For the traditional immune parameters, with 
30 samples in each elderly treatment group, at the alpha level of 0.01, we can reject the null 
hypothesis of zero correlation with 80% power if the true correlation is 0.57 using a two-sided 
test for Pearso n’s correlation coefficient.  
For the gene expression data, the actual data analysis will be performed using SAM with 
quantitative outcome. For sample size consideration, we will consider the simpler case of 
testing the significance of Pearson’s correlatio n coefficient. We use the alpha level of 0.005 to 
offset the effect of multiple testing. This means an average of one false positive for every 200 
null genes tested, which is an acceptable level as we expect the number of innate signature 
genes under study will be in the hundreds. The alpha level used here is different from that in 
HIPC: VAX-003 CONFIDENTIAL Page 57 of 80 
  
Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 Primary Aim 1, because the numbers of multiple tests being conducted are different (several 
hundreds v.s. tens of thousands in Aim 1). With 30 samples in each elderly treatment group, at 
the alpha level of 0.005, we can reject the null hypothesis of zero correlation with adaptive 
immune responses with 80% power if the true correlation is 0.60 using a two-sided test for 
Pearson’s correlation coefficient.  
9.2. Data Analysis 
9.2.1. General considerations 
The young treatment groups are of limited size. The main purpose of the young treatment 
groups is to provide some indication whether the elderly respond to the vaccines differently 
than the young. By themselves, the young groups do not have sufficient statistical power to 
generate reliable innate and correlation signatures. However when used in comparison against 
elderly groups, and by only considering biological pathways (collections of genes contributing 
to the same biological process) that are affected by the vaccine, they can provide some 
indication as to how different the response is in the elderly compared to the young.  Thus for 
data analysis, the young treatment groups will be used only in exploratory endpoints. The 
primary and secondary endpoints will focus on the elderly groups.  
 
The analyses will be based on population with critical time points met, defined as those who 
received vaccine per label and got the 4 draws required for the primary endpoint, i.e. draws at 
days 1, 3, 7 (+1), and 30 (+7)  within the required windows. Data from the study will be 
analyzed using the statistical software R31 .High-throughput data will be analyzed using 
appropriate methods, either by stand-alone software or modules in leading statistical softwares, 
e.g. the Bioconductor in the R framework32 .For cytokine data, missing values will be dealt with 
using multiple imputations. For microarray data, nearest neighbor method and local least 
squares may be used to fill missing values. Unsupervised learning techniques such as PCA, 
PLSDA, clustering, and factor analysis 33 will be used for the visualization and identification of 
global patterns. For descriptive endpoint (primary endpoint 2), we will generate summary 
statistics, and visualize the data using histograms and boxplots when applicable. For the 
identification of innate signatures, the two treatment groups will be analyzed separately.

Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 Analyses of primary endpoints: 
1. Identification of generic innate immune signatures [Traditional immune parameters measurements 
+ array-based gene expression] at days 1, 3 and 7 post vaccination with either PPV23 or PCV13 in the 
elderly. 
The innate signatures will be detected in each elderly treatment group separately. We will take 
the measurements on the day of vaccination as baseline. For traditional immune parameters, we 
will test if an immune parameter shows significant change over baseline at day 1, 3, and 7 after 
each vaccination, using a two-sided paired t-test. In addition, for each immune parameter, the 
fold-change over baseline will be calculated for every subject. The average (arithmetic mean) 
fold change over the 30 subjects will be combined with the test p-value in a selection criterion as 
appropriate. Based on previous studies similar in nature, the tentative selection criterion is p-
value ≤ 0.01 and average fold change ≥ 3.  
For the gene expression data, again the innate signatures will be detected in each elderly 
treatment group separately. We will use the method Significance Analysis of Microarrays 
(SAM) 34 with paired design to find differentially expressed genes over the baseline. False 
discovery rate (FDR) will be used as selection criterion. The tentative selection criterion is FDR ≤ 
0.1.  
2. Measurement of adaptive immune responses [Opsonophagocytosis assay (OPA) titers] at day 30 post 
vaccination with either PPV23 or PCV13 in the elderly. 
The OPA titers will be presented as descriptions of the actual values separately in both study 
elderly populations (PPV23 and PCV13 recipients). Summary statistics, boxplots and 
histograms will be used to summarize the data.    
3. Correlation of signatures of generic innate immune responses at days 1, 3 and 7 that correlate to 
adaptive immune responses [Opsonophagocytosis assay OPA titers] at day 30 post vaccination with 
either PPV23 or PCV13 in the elderly.  
The correlation signatures will be detected in each elderly treatment group separately. The 
innate signature markers/genes identified in Primary Endpoint 1 will be used in this step for 
the identification of correlation signature.  
For traditional immune parameters, we will calculate the correlation coefficient between the 
immune parameter and the adaptive immune response (day 30 OPA titers). The p-values 
associated with the correlation coefficients will be used to select traditional immune parameters

tentative selection criterion is p- value ≤ 0.01.  
For gene expression data, we will use the method Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) 
with quantitative outcome to identify genes that are significantly associated with the respective 
adaptive immune responses (day 30 OPA titers). False discovery rate (FDR) will be used as 
selection criterion. The tentative selection criterion is FDR ≤ 0.1.  
 
Analyses of secondary endpoints: 
1. Comparison of the serotype specific IgG levels at day 30 post vaccination with either PPV23 or PCV13 
in the elderly. 
Descriptive analysis, boxpots and histograms, will be conducted to present the data. Testing 
between the two elderly treatment groups will be conducted using unpaired t- test after proper 
data transformation. In the case that near-normality cannot be achieved with data 
transformation, we will resort to the Wilcoxon test.  
2.  Correlation of signatures of generic innate immune responses at days 1, 3 and 7 with serotype specific 
IgG levels at day 30 post vaccination with either PPV23 or PCV13 in the elderly.   
The analysis will be conducted in each elderly treatment group separately. For traditional 
immune parameters, we will calculate the correlation coefficient between the immune 
parameter and the adaptive immune response (IgG levels at day 30 post vaccination). The p-
values associated with the correlation coefficients will be used to select traditional immune 
parameters that are associated with the respective adaptive immune responses (IgG levels at 
day 30 post vaccination). The tentative selection criterion is p- value ≤ 0.01.  
For gene expression data, we will use the method Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) 
with quantitative outcome to identify genes that are significantly associated with the respective 
adaptive immune responses (IgG levels at day 30 post vaccination). False discovery rate (FDR) 
will be used as selection criterion. The tentative selection criterion is FDR ≤ 0.1.  
3. Comparison of the serotype-specific avidity indexes in a subset of up to 6 vaccinees per vaccine group 
at day 180 post vaccination with either PPV23 or PCV13 in the elderly. 
Descriptive analysis, boxpots and histograms, will be conducted to present the data. Testing 
between the two elderly treatment groups will be conducted using unpaired t-test after proper 
data transformation. In the case that near-normality cannot be achieved with data 
transformation, we will resort to the Wilcoxon test.

avidity indexes in a subset of up to 6 vaccinees per vaccine group at day 180 post vaccination with either 
PPV23 or PCV13 in the elderly. 
The analysis will be conducted in each elderly treatment group separately. For traditional 
immune parameters, we will calculate the correlation coefficient between the immune 
parameter and the adaptive immune response  (serotype specific avidity indexes at day 180 p) 
the p-values associated with the correlation coefficients will be used to select traditional 
immune parameters that are associated with the respective adaptive immune responses 
(serotype specific avidity indexes at day 180). The tentative selection criterion is p- value ≤ 0.01.  
For gene expression data, we will use the method Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM)

adaptive immune responses (serotype specific avidity indexes at day 180). False discovery rate 
(FDR) will be used as selection criterion. The tentative selection criterio n is FDR ≤ 0.1.  
5.  Comparison of the adaptive immune responses [Opsonophagocytosis assay (OPA) titers] at day 30 
post vaccination with either PPV23 or PCV13 in the elderly. 
Descriptive analysis, boxpots and histograms, will be conducted to present and visually 
contrast the data. Testing between the two elderly treatment groups will be conducted using 
unpaired t-test after proper data transformation. In the case that near-normality cannot be 
achieved with data transformation, we will resort to the Wilcoxon test.  
 
Analyses of exploratory endpoints 
1. Correlation of signatures of generic innate immune responses at days 1, 3 and 7 with adaptive immune 
responses [Opsonophagocytosis assay OPA titers specifically] at day 30 post vaccination among subjects 
in diff erent age strata   
First, we will identify innate signatures in each young treatment group, as well as potentially in 
each age stratum of each elderly treatment group. There are a total of potentially 8 groups: 
participants between the ages of 25-40 receiving PPV23, participants between the ages of 25-40 
receiving PCV13, participants between the ages of 60-69 receiving PPV23, participants between 
the ages of 60-69 receiving PCV13, participants between the ages of 70-79 receiving PPV23, 
participants between the ages of 70-79 receiving PCV13, participants between the ages of 80-89 
HIPC: VAX-003 CONFIDENTIAL Page 61 of 80 
  
Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 receiving PPV23, participants between the ages of 80-89 receiving PCV13. The analysis will be 
done using the same method described in the analysis plan of Primary Aim 1.  
For correlation analysis, the analysis is similar to primary endpoint 3. Instead of using all the 
data, we will analyze each age stratum within each treatment group separately.  
2. Comparison of the kinetics and magnitude of select serotype specific plasmablasts (days 7, 14, 30  (with 
day 30 on a subset of vaccinees only) ) and memory B cells (days 30, 180) post vaccination with either 
PPV23 or PCV13 in the elderly.  
Summary statistics, boxplots and histograms will be used to summarize and visually contrast 
the data. We will use t-test or Wilcoxon test to compare each immune parameter (magnitude, 
kinetics) from D0 to D180 post vaccination between the two treatment groups at the pre-
specified time points for serotype specific plasmablasts (days 7, 14, 30 with day 30 on a subset of 
vaccinees only)) and for memory B cells (days 30, 180).  
3. Comparison of the plasmablats repertoire and monoclonal antibodies from plasmablasts in a subset of 
vaccinees per vaccine group at day 7 post vaccination with either PPV23 or PCV13 in the elderly. 
The repertoire and monoclonal antibody levels will be presented as descriptions of the actual 
values. Summary statistics, boxplots and histograms will be used to summarize the data. 
Testing between the two treatment groups will be conducted using t-test or Wilcoxon test.  
4. Comparison of identified innate signature variables and correlation signature variables 
between PPV23 and PCV13 recipients 
After identifying the innate immune signatures and correlation immune signatures within each 
elderly treatment group and each young treatment group, there is an interest in comparing the 
signatures between PPV23 and PCV13 recipients. Here we consider four groups: elderly PPV23, 
elderly PCV13, young PPV23 and young PCV13. Each group has two signatures – innate 
signature and correlation signature. For each group, the correlations signature is a subset of the 
innate signature. For both the innate and the correlation signature, we will make comparisons  
between:  
# A-- the two vaccine groups in the same age category : elderly (60-89) receiving PPV23 v.s. 
elderly (60-89) receiving PCV13 and young (25-40) receiving PPV23 v.s. young (25-40) 
receiving PCV13),  
HIPC: VAX-003 CONFIDENTIAL Page 62 of 80 
  
Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 # B-- all the other possible combinations: elderly (60-89) receiving PPV23 v.s. young (25-40) 
receiving PPV23; elderly (60-89) receiving PPV23 v.s. young (25-40) receiving PCV13; elderly 
(60-89) receiving PCV13  v.s. young (25-40) receiving PPV23; elderly (60-89) receiving PCV13 
v.s. young (25-40) receiving PCV13. 
This part of the analysis will depend on the results of the aforementioned analysis and hard to 
specify at this stage.  
As a preliminary consideration, the identified innate signature variables and correlation 
signature variables can be contrasted between groups using descriptive statistics, such 
tabulation and Venn diagrams.  
5. Comparison of generic innate immune responses at days 1, 3 and 7 with adaptive immune 
responses [Opsonophagocytosis assay OPA titers and ELISA] at years 2-3.5 post vaccination with either 
PPV23 or PCV13. 
For correlation analysis, the analysis is similar to primary endpoint 3. Instead of using all th e 
data, we will analyze data in the elderly.  
 
Enriched biological pathways can be identified using each type of signature in each of the four 
groups considered above (i.e.  elderly (60-89) receiving PPV23, elderly (60-89) receiving 
PCV13, young (25-40) receiving PPV23 and young (25-40) receiving PCV13) ,  using gene 
ontology (computer program that generates biological networks from gene lists). Then the 
enriched pathways can be manually compared between the different treatment groups as per 
#A and #B above. Biological interpretations of the differences will be made.  
9.2.2. Patient populations 
For all endpoints, our data analysis will be based on all subjects who are randomized, receive 
vaccination per label, and for whom there is a blood sample taken at the 2 required time points 
(Day 0 and Day 30 +/- 7 days ) and or Day 0 and Day 180.

Summary of descriptive statistics for baseline and demographic characteristics will be provided 
for all enrolled participants. Demographic data will include age, race, sex, medical history 
including medication, vaccination history and previous documented Pneumococcal disease will 
be recorded.  
9.2.4 Status of Study Subjects  
Status of study subjects (continue in the study vs. left the study and reasons for discontinuation) 
will be incorporated to the periodic safety reports. 
9.3. Interim Analyses  
N/A 
 
9.4. Deviations from Statistical Plan 
The principal features of the study design and of the plan for statistical analysis of the data are 
outlined in this protocol . Any changes in these principal features will require a protocol 
amendment and will be described in the final report. These changes will be subject to review by 
the IRB, ISM and NIAID.  
Although our statistical methods and time-points for measurements will adhere to what is 
proposed herein, our experience with analyses of similar studies in the past has underscored the 
need for flexibility and adaptability in trying different statistical approaches to arrive at the 
most informative results.  
As such, we may use alternative approaches such as the gene set enrichment analyses, or other 
approaches, and run additional statistical analyses of data generated by use of assays at time 
points other than those stated in the primary, secondary and exploratory endpoints, on an ad 
hoc basis.

Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13  Version 7 .0 March 30, 2017 * Any Adverse Event (including – but not only- vaccine reactions and local or systemic 
Reactogenicity Events) of grade 3 or higher severity or serious adverse event (SAE) occurring 
after vaccination while the subjects is still at the clinical site will be recorded and reported. 
** Instruction includes the following: 
1. Participants will be provided (on Day 0 only ) with a written description of what represents a 
local and systemic vaccine reaction of mild, moderate and severe intensity and instructed to call 
the site to report reactogencity events of grade 3 (severe) or higher severity within 1 week 
following vaccination. 
2. Participants will also be instructed to promptly call the site if he/she develops any of the 
following: 
 Becomes sick or has been treated at the doctor’s office or emergency department or ha s 
been hospitalized for any illness throughout D180 of the study; 
 Develops any adverse event that limits self-care activities of daily living (e.g.  bathing, 
dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bed 
ridden) even if he/she decides not to get medical care; or 
 he/she starts/stops medications during enrollment in the study. 
 Becomes pregnant. 
*** Assessment of health status includes: 
 Evaluation of local REs and systemic REs of grade 3 or higher severity developing after 
the last visit (only until Day 7 Visit) 
 Any adverse event (AE) that limited self-care activities of daily living or any serious  
adverse event (SAE) which may not have been reported by the participant by calling the 
site as directed at a prior visit 
 Any medications administered after vaccination. 
**** Innate assays will not be conducted at days 30 and 180. Adaptive assays will not be 
condu
cted at day 1. 
***** Eligible female subjects aged 25-40 years will use effective contraception 1 month prior and 
one month following vaccination. 
***** Only for major health problems

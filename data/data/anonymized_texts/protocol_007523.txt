 1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA 
 
This is a  doubl e-blind ed, randomi zed trial. Its purpose is to compare the steroid cream 
mom etasone furoate 0.1%  (MF), with st andard emollient skin care, Eucerin, on the  prevention of 
grade 2 or higher skin toxi cities in b reast cancer patients receiving PMRT to the chest wall and 
regional lymph no des. Patients will be  stratified based on two variables: the presence of a 
reconstruction in o rder to achieve a balanced pop ulation of  patients being treated with either 
photon or  electron beams, and bo dy mass ind ex (BMI <30 vs ≥30 ). 
 
Female breast cancer patients who h ave received mastectomy + axillary surgery and will und ergo 
postm astectomy radiation (PMRT) at our institution are eligible  for this study. Enrollment of 143 
patients is expected to take place over 3 years. 
 
Skin toxicities using the Common  Terminolo gy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.4 scale 
will be  scored by evaluating RN or MD . Ass essments will be  completed at baseline, weekly 
during radiation th erapy (RT), and 10-14 days following the  completion of RT. Patient-reported 
skin symptoms will also be  assessed at baseline, at week 5 of RT, and 10-14 days following 
compl etion of RT.

 3.0 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE 
 
3.1 Benefit of Postmastectomy Ra diation 
 
 
PMRT is an essential compon ent of treatment for locally advanced breast cancer. The publi cation 
of the Ox ford Overview m eta-analyses of randomized clinical trials in 2005  showed that, 
compared with surgery alone, the addition of PMRT after mastectomy both reduced the rate of 
local cancer recurrence and improved 15-year breast cancer mortality by 5% (Clarke, Collins et 
al. 2005). Although the clinical benefits of PMRT are well established, there is a paucity of data 
available on the acute toxicities of PMRT, namely, skin toxicities. The majority of studi es that 
examine  quality of life after mastectomy focus primarily on cosmetic and psychosocial issues. 
 
3.2 Ra diation-Induced Dermatitis 
 
 
A variety of patient and treatment-related factors such as fractionation schedules, dose, size of 
the treatment field, concurrent chemotherapy, use of bolus  or other beam-modifying devices, 
and individu al genetic variation can affect the intensity of the skin reaction to radiation 
(Tucker, Turesson et al. 1992 ). The majority of data available regarding side effects are 
generated from patients receiving radiation to the int act breast, not the chest wall after 
mastectomy. Side effects are generally categorized as acute if occurring during or within 6 
weeks of radiation t reatment and late if occurring >6 weeks after completion of treatment. A 
common  acute toxicity is dermatitis within the irradiated volum e. Typically, the skin becomes 
erythematous and/or hyperpigm ented, and may desquamate, in particular in the area of skin 
folds such as the axilla, supraclavicular fossa, or inframammary fold. Desquamation may be 
dry  or  moist.  Progressive  erythema  may  be  seen  after  10-20  Gy,  depending  on  the 
fractionation schedule (Turesson and No tter 1975 ), and reaches maximal int ensity 
approxim ately 1-2 weeks following the completion of treatment. An example of the 
developm ent of moist  desquamation and grade 2 erythema in a woman 1 week post- 
completion of PMRT to an unreconstructed chest wall is illustrated in Appendix 3. 
 
Factors contributing to variation in the severity of dermatitis in patients receiving PMRT have 
not been well studi ed. Acute skin toxicities are generally more severe in the setting of PMRT 
than breast conservation therapy (BCT), as the skin itself is consid ered part of the radiation 
target with PMRT. There are remarkably little  data available on the incidence of radiation 
dermatitis in the post-mastectomy chest wall setting. The three large randomi zed trials 
investigating the use of PMRT either do not report toxicity or report late toxicity excluding skin 
toxicities (Overgaard, Hansen et al. 1997;  Overgaard, Jensen et al. 1999;  Ragaz, Olivotto et al. 
2005 ). One s mall retrospective series of 89 patients receiving PMRT using an electron technique 
reported that 19 patients developed dry desquamation, and only five developed moist 
desquamation (Hehr, Budach et al. 1999). In contrast, a series of 118 patients treated with a 
similar technique reported that 52% of patients developed grade 3-4 skin toxicity by Radiation 
Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria, and 31% of patients required an unplanned treatment 
break to recover from early radiation-induced skin toxicities (Spierer, Hong et al. 2004). 
 
The  developm ent  of  normal  tissue  toxicities  in  breast  cancer  patients  receiving  adjuvant 
external beam RT demonstrates significant heterogeneity among  individuals (Twardella, Popanda 
et  al.  2003),  which  can  be  attributed  to  a  variety of  individual,  tumor  stage,  cellular,  and 
molecular factors. Increasing evidence suggests that individual genetic variations  may also play a 
significant role in the developm ent of adverse radiation respons es (De Ruyck, Van Eijkeren et al.

 2005;  Andreassen, Alsner et al. 2006;  Alsbeih, El-Sebaie et al. 2007 ), but these remain poorly 
understood. Existing estimates on rates of radiation d ermatitis are extrapolated from patients with 
intact breasts, who have been treated with a variety of techniques that affect the developm ent of 
dermatitis. A  randomi zed  trial  investigating  the  use  of   intensity-modulated  RT  (IMRT)  in 
the setting  of  BCT  demonstrated  moist  desquamation  in  31.2% receiving IMRT and 47.8% 
with standard treatment, respectively (Pignol,  Olivotto et al. 2008 ). The primary factor that 
predisposed to moist  desquamation was large breast size; race-ethnicity and genetic factors were 
not assessed in this Canadian study.  In Table 1, we summarize the results from the few studies 
that  have  specifically evaluated  skin  toxicities  in  breast  cancer  patients  who  h ave  received 
PMRT.

3.3 Evidence for Topical Agents’ Prevention and Treatment of Radiation-Induced Dermatitis 
 
 
Acute  radiation  dermatitis  has  been  attributed  to  the  combin ed  result  of  a  decrease  in 
functional stem cells, changes in the skin’s endothelial cells, inflammation, cell necrosis, and 
death (Hymes et al. 2006 ). Proposed mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory effect of 
corticosteroids include vasoconstriction, decreased capillary permeability, and inhibition of 
leukocyte proliferation and migration (Yohn,199 0). Ho wever, all mechanisms are not fully 
elucidated. 
 
At the present time, there are no established standards for either the prevention  or management 
of radiation-induced skin reactions. Intervention is primarily based on clinician experience. 
Num erous products are used by various radiation oncology departments throughout  the world. 
Biafene cream (Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceuticals, Titus ville, NJ, USA) was evaluated in a 
multi center randomi zed trial condu cted by the  RTOG  and was not found to be superior to 
standard regimens in the prevention of radiation-induced skin reactions (Fisher, Scott et al. 
2000). Generally, it is agreed that a key element of the prevention of radiation dermatitis is 
moisturizing the irradiated area with Eucerin, Aquaphor, aloe vera, or other hydrophilic  products 
(Maddocks-Jennings, Wilkinson  et al. 2005). The emphasis has been on teaching self care to 
minim ize skin trauma, irritation, and or/infection. In our department, we recommend the 
application of Eucerin BID to the breast or chest wall as standard care for our  breast cancer 
patients. Moist d esquamation is  treated with Silvadene cream or hydrocolloid d ressings. 
 
To  date,  five  t rials  have  evaluated  topical  corticosteroids  for  the  prevention  of  acute  skin 
reactions in patients receiving radiation (Bostrom, Lindm an et al. 2001; Schmuth, Wimmer et al. 
2002; Shukla, Gairola et al. 2006;  Omidvari, Saboori et al. 2007;  Miller, Schwartz et al. 2011).

 The details and results of these studies are summ arized in Table 2;  however, these studi es 
collectively demonst rated that topical corticosteroid agents used as the sole skin care regimen 
during irradiation reduced the  severity of skin reactions following RT.

Mometasone furoate is a medium -strength topical steroid that has a low atrophog enic potential, 
and has demonst rated greater anti-inflammatory activity and a longer duration of action than 
other medium -strength topical steroids such as betamethasone (Prakash & Benfield, 1998 ).  MF 
has  been  shown  to  be  effective  in  reducing  clinically  appreciated  radiation  dermatitis  and 
pruritus in patients who are receiving whole breast radioth erapy in several randomi zed trials 
comparing MF with a placebo emolli ent (Bostrom, Lindman et al. 2001; Miller, Schwartz et al. 
2011). However, its applicability in patients who have undergone mastectomy and receive 
irradiation of the chest wall has not been establish ed. Only one  of these studies included patients 
who received chest wall radioth erapy but, because the sample  size was so small, they were 
unable to draw definitive conclusions  regarding the benefit of MF in this popul ation (Miller et 
al., 2011 ). The aim of this study is to elucidate the effect of mometasone furoate versus 
standard of care on patients receiving post-mastectomy irradiation, specifically.

 3.4 Patient-Reported Outcomes and Provider Assessment Tools for Radiation Dermatitis 
 
 
Currently, the most widely used standardized method of recording provider-assessed toxicities 
is the CTCAE version 4. CTCAE h as been shown to result in stable assessments of toxicities 
among practition ers (Trotti, 2003 ). Using this  assessment tool, grade ≥2 radiation dermatitis 
encompasses an assessment of both the degree of erythema and desquamation, as gauged by the 
provider. Grade 2 erythema is defined as “moderate to brisk,” and grade 2 
MD is d efined as “patchy, most ly confined to skin folds and creases” (CTCAE v4.03, 2009 ). 
 
There is evidence that patients and clinicians differ in their assessment of the severity of 
subjective skin toxicities (such as pruritus) during radiation (Neben-Wittich M. A., 2011). The 
Skindex-16 is a  tool designed to capture patient-reported assessments of subjective adverse 
effects. Skindex-16 is comprised of sixteen questions, which are sub-categorized into an 
emotional subs cale (six question s), a functional subs cale (five question s), and a symptom 
subscale (five questions ). Rankings of the questionn aire are then averaged to obtain a score of 
severity of patient-reported outcomes. This allows providers to gauge which aspects of the 
patient’s experience are most affected by the treatment. 
 
The Fitzpatrick Skin Classification is a  well-recognized tool for patients’ initial assessment of 
their general level of skin sensitivi ty. The scale ranges from category I to VI, representing a  range 
from p ale skin/ always burns to d ark skin/n ever burns (Fitzpatrick TB, 198 8). 
 
 
4.0 OVERVIEW OF STUDY  DESIGN/INT ERVENTION  
 
4.1 Design 
 
This is a  Phase III doubl e-blind ed, randomi zed trial. Its purpose is to compare MF 0.1%, a 
steroid cream, with standard emollient skin care, Eucerin, on t he prevention of acute grade 2 
or higher skin toxi cities in breast cancer patients receiving PMRT to the chest wall and 
regional lymph no des. We hypothesize that MF will prevent moderate to severe radiation 
dermatitis in women undergoing chest wall irradiation for breast cancer. 
 
4.2 Intervention 
 
Eligible patients will receive skin care according to their randomi zation assignment du ring 
radiation th erapy. Skin toxicity assessments and assessment of patient-reported compliance 
will be  done on a weekly basis w hile the patient is receiving RT, by the RN or physician 
utilizing CTCAE 4.0 and the weekly status check form, as per current standard practice. 
Patient-reported skin toxicities will be  measured using the Skindex-16 assessment tool. 
Patients will report Fitzpatrick Skin Category at the time of the Histo ry and Physical. 
 
Patients will be  follow ed at 10-14 days after the completion of  treatment du ring which time 
they will h ave a provider skin assessment and th ey will compl ete an addition al Skindex-16 
Assessment.

 5.0 THERAPEUTIC/D IAGNOSTIC AGENTS 
 
5.1 Mometasone Furoate 
 
 
Class:  Anti-inflammatory agents 
ATC Class:  D07A C13 
VA Class:  DE200  
Chemical Name: 9α,21-dichloro-11β,17 -dihydroxy-16α-methyl-17(2-furanylcarbonyl)pregna- 
1,4-diene-3,20-dione  
Molecular Formula: C27H30Cl2O6 
CAS  Number: 83919 -23-7 
Brands: Elocon 
 
Topical MF is a medium -potency corticosteroid that modifies the body's immune  response by 
suppressing the formation, release, and activity of endog enous mediators of inflammation, 
including prostaglandins,  kinins,  histamines, liposomal enzymes, and the compl ement system. It 
is available in a 0.1% cream, lotion or ointment form. Indications  for topical use include relief of 
inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.  MF has a low 
atrophog enic potential, and a longer duration of  action th an oth er topical steroids in its class. 
 
5.2 Eucerin Original cream 
Eucerin Original is a hydrous l anolin emolli ent skin cream, whi ch is u sed to soften and moistu rize 
the skin. Emolli ents may be used as lubricants to treat or prevent dry, itchy skin,  and minor  skin 
irritations.  
 
5.3 Skindex-16 Ass essment Module 
The us efulness of patient-reported outcomes as an alternate means to measure side effects has 
been reported in the lit erature (Huschka, Mandrekar et al. 2007 ). The Skindex-16 is an analog 
scale  of  symptoms  and  functional  endpoints  related  to  skin  toxicity that  can  occur  in  the 
treatment area, and has been assessed for reliability: scale scores were reproducible after 72 
hours, and demonst rate both content and construct validity (Chren, Lasek et al. 2001 ). It has 
been used for patients to rate skin conditions  that have occurred within the previous week. It 
consists  of a short 16-item assessment completed by the patient, using numerical analogue scales 
(0 = never bothered to 6 = always bothered). Respons es to the Skindex-16 are categorized into 
three subscales: symptom, emotio nal, and functional (Appendix 1).

7.0 RECRUIT MENT PLAN 
 
All female patients who received a mastectomy and plan to receive PMRT at MSKCC 
will be eligible  for screening. Potential participants will be identified by the protocol 
investigators or the departmental breast research team. 
 
Approxim ately 120-150 breast cancer patients receive PMRT in the  Department of Radiation 
Oncology in the  Main Campus p er year. On average, 15-20 mastectomy patients are under 
treatment at any moment, thus providing  a large pool of patients who could be eligible  for this 
study. We estimate treating 70-80 eligible  patients at the Main Campus per year, which would 
enable us to reach our accrual goal of 143 p atients within 3years.

 9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  PLAN 
 
9.1 Skin Cream Application 
 
Arm 1 consists of patients randomized to standard of care arm (Eucerin) and Arm 2 is the 
experimental arm (MF 0.1%). Patients will start applying the agent to the chest wall twice 
daily beginning on the first day of radiation treatment and continuing  10-14 days post- 
compl etion of  RT. 
 
Patient education regarding amount to be applied (amount  depending  on body habitus)  and 
area of treatment field will be reinforced by the  R.N. prior to the first radiation treatment. 
Patients will be instructed to apply cream to the upper outer quadrant, upper inner quadrant, 
lower outer quadrant, and lower inner quadrant, as well as irradiated nodal fields. They will 
be instructed to apply cream in a thin, uniform layer twice a day, in the morning and 
evening, and not within  the imm ediate 4 hours prior to  radiation treatment. Patients will be 
informed that application immediately following  radiation treatment is acceptable for those 
scheduled to receive morning treatments. 
 
Patients will be instructed to wash the area daily using a mild soap such as Dove  or 
Cetaphil, and to pat skin dry prior to cream application. Patients will be instructed to avoid 
the use of any exfoliating agents, such as loofah, spong es, or scrubs. Skin will not be 
washed for at least 8 ho urs after each application. 
 
Patients will be instructed to wear soft, loose clothing to cover the treated areas, but not to 
use any occlusive dressings, and to avoid exposu re to the sun. The use of sunscreens should 
be discouraged, with a preference to using clothing  to cover the treatment area when 
exposu re to the sun is expected. Patients will be discouraged from scratching the treated 
area and using possible s kin irritants such as aftershaves, colognes, and perfumes. 
Aluminum -free deodorants will be permitted.   Topical and/or systemic treatments for 
prophylaxis of dermatitis oth er than assigned cream will be prohibit ed during the study. 
 
The topi cal agents will be blinded and dispensed after randomi zation at patient’s simul ation 
visit or  at the radiation s etup in 130 gram jars labelled with patient’s name and MRN by the 
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) pharmacy.  It is estimated that the 
average patient will require approximately 3 grams of cream per application, and will 
require one addition al prescription  for a jar of study cream during the 7 week trial.  During 
weekly assessment of compliance at routine  status check, date of dispensation of second jar 
will be  recorded on p rovider assessment sheet as an addition al indi cator of compli ance. 
 
Patients will return to clinic for a follow  up visit at 10-14 days followi ng the compl etion of 
RT. At this visit the study inv estigator will perform  a skin assessment and the patient will 
compl ete the Skindex-16. 
 
9.2 C hest Wall Ra diotherapy 
 
 
 
The radiation t reatment included in this stu dy represents the  instit utional standard of care and 
is not influenced by the  patient’s decision to participate in this study. Either photons or 
electrons will be used for the primary radiotherapy treatment, depending on reconstruction

 the chest wall with customized bolus, or photon tangents with daily bolus over the chest 
wall.  Patients who have a reconstruction are treated with two tangential photon beams and 
bolus over the reconstructed breast everyday. Treatment breaks necessitated by severe 
toxicities will be  recorded and will not be  consid ered deviations.  
 
Concurrent delivery of chemotherapy will not be allowed. Biologic  agents and hormonal 
therapy during radiation will be  permitted. 
10.0 EVALUATION D URING TREATMENT/INT ERVENTION  
 
10.1 Evaluation During Radiation 
Weekly status checks including  assessment of patient compli ance and Provider Skin Toxicity 
Assessments using  CTCAE 4.0 du ring radiation treatment will be  performed according to 
standard practice in the  Department of Radiation On cology. The patient will compl ete the 
Skindex-16 form du ring the last week of RT (week 5). The  amount of  topical agent used will 
be evaluated based on t iming  of patient’s request for refillby an R.N. in o rder to assess 
compli ance with the  treatment regimen and will be  documented on the  Provider Skin To xicity 
Assessment form. 
 
10.2 Evaluations After Radiation 
Follow -up visits will be  compl eted 10-14 days after the compl etion of  RT. At this tim e, 
provider assessment of skin toxi city will be  performed by the physician and RN, and the 
patient will compl ete another Skindex-16 form.

 11.0 TOXICITI ES/SIDE EFFECTS 
 
The patient will be monito red for erythema and desquamation in the radiation field, which are 
expected side effects from chest wall radiotherapy. Some patients may develop moist 
desquamation, which usually heals within a few weeks and is treated with Silvadene cream 
and/or hydrocolloid  dressings.  Treatment breaks secondary to severe acute skin toxicities and/or 
cellulitis du ring radiation are not anticipated. 
 
If a patient develops grade 2 or greater moist  desquamation, or adverse reaction to the topi cal 
agent, she will be instructed to discontinue  study cream and will receive standard of care 
management as determined by the patient’s provider.  These patients will continue  to be  evaluated 
according to study guidelines, and intervention  will be noted on the Provider Skin Toxicity 
Assessment form.   Patients who develop grade 2 erythema without  the p resence of moist 
desquamation will continue  to use  study cream without d eviation from p rotocol guidelines. 
 
Side effects from MF are uncommo n. In controlled clinical studies of MF, the incidence of 
adverse reactions of burning, pruritus, and skin atrophy was 1.6%. Infrequent side effects 
include i rritation, dryness, folliculitis, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions,  hypopigmentation, 
allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, striae, and miliaria. Systemic absorption may 
produce reversible hypothalamic-pituit ary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations  of 
Cushing  syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glycosuria. 
 
Eucerin Original side  effects are rare but in clude skin redness, irritation, and itching. 
 
 
12.0 CRIT ERIA FOR TH ERAPEUTIC R ESPONSE/OUTCO ME ASSES SMENT 
 
12.1 Ass essment of Primary Objective 
The grading of skin toxicity will be based on the CTCAE version 4.0 scale as defined in section 
3.4. To ensure unbiased skin toxicity measurement, both the  clinical team and patient will be 
blind ed to the treatment assignment. The type of skin toxicity (moist  desquamation or grade ≥2 
erythema), maximal score, its location within the target (chest wall or axilla), and time to 
occurrence will be recorded weekly during RT and at week 2 follow-up on the Provider Skin 
Toxicity Assessment Form. Following  the post-treatment visit, the patient will not need to return 
to the clinic for other follow-up visits  unless oth erwise specified by the treating physician. 
 
 
12.2 Ass essment of Secondary Objectives 
The Skindex-16 module  score will be utilized to assess patient-reported toxicities at baseline, 
during week 5 of RT, and 10-14 days post-RT. 
 
The maximal reported toxicity score and time to occurrence will be assessed weekly and at 
the two w eek follow up.  
 
13.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
It will be  made clear to all participants th at they are allowed to withdraw from the  study at any 
time. If at any time the patient is found  to be  ineligible  from the protocol as designated in the 
section on  Criteria for Patient/Subject Eligi bility, the patient will be  removed from the  study.

 14.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
This is a doubl e-blind ed, randomized trial (see Section 15.2 for details of randomization) to 
compare MF 0.1% cream with standard skin care (Eucerin) on the prevention  of moderate to 
severe skin toxicities in b reast cancer patients receiving post -mastectomy radiation to  the chest 
wall and regional lymph nodes. A patient is deemed to have developed skin toxicity if she has a 
grade ≥2 skin toxi city as defined in Section 3.4 within 7 weeks from the  beginning of radiation. 
 
Based on estimates provided by radiation oncologists at our instit ution, the rate of grade ≥2 
toxicity using  Eucerin as skin care for chest wall radiation is ≈ 50%. This estimate is slightly 
lower than the findin gs from the Spierer study cited in section 3.2, to reflect this study’s 
inclusion  of patients treated with photons  (in the p resence of reconstruction) as well as 
electrons.  We expect that the usage of MF can reduce this rate to 25%. 124 evaluable patients 
are needed for the comparison, with 62 patients in each arm. Two-sample, two-sided 
proportion tests will be used to derive the statistical significance. One interim analysis will be 
conducted when 31 patients in each arm have been enrolled and evaluated using the O’Brien- 
Flemming procedure, which will declare significance if the test p-value is less than 0.005. 
Correspond ingly the final analysis will declare significance if the test p-value is less than 0.048. 
This design has a power of approximately 0.83 (i.e., detecting the true toxicity rate of 25% or 
lower) at the type I error (i.e., declaring MF more effective while  it yields the same toxicity 
rate as Eucerin) rate of 0.05 based on 100000 st atistical simul ations.  
 
All deaths unrelated to the toxicities, and patients lost to follow-up (before toxicities can be 
evaluated), will be excluded from the comparison and new patients will be accrued for 
replacement. To this end we plan to enroll an addition al 15% of patients. Therefore our final 
proposed accrual is about 143 p atients, which is expected to be done  in 3 years. 
 
Patient-reported skin symptoms will be scored from the Skindex-16 surveys and compared 
between interventions  using Wilcoxon  tests at each separate assessment time point . Analysis of 
covariance  may  also  be  used  when  the  baseline  information  is  taken  into  account  as  a 
covariate. Multiple comparison tools  will be employed to adjust for statistical significance 
levels. Maximum  reported skin toxicities will be tabulated and summary statistics will be 
provided. Time to occurrence of skin toxicity will be handled by routine survival analysis such 
as Kaplan-Meier estimation, log-rank tests, and/or Cox regression  models when comparisons 
are needed. 
 
 
15.0 RESEARCH PARTICIPANT REGISTRATION AND RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURE S 
 
15.1 Research  Participant Registration 
Confirm eligibility as defined in the  section entitled Criteria for Patient/Subject Eligibility. 
Obtain informed consent, by followi ng procedures defined in s ection entitled Informed 
Consent Procedures. 
 
During the registration p rocess registering indivi duals will be  required to compl ete a protocol 
specific Eligibility Checklist. 
Page 15 of 20 
Amended: 08 /07/13 
MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING  CANCER CENTER 
IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#: 13-069 A(1)  
 All p articipants must be  registered through the  Protocol Participant Registration (PPR) Office 
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. PPR is available Mond ay through Friday from 
8:30am – 5:30pm at 646 -735-8000. Registrations must be  submitt ed via  the PPR Electronic 
Registration System (http://pp r/).  The  compl eted signature page of the written consent/RA or 
verbal script/RA, a compl eted Eligibility Checklist and oth er relevant do cuments must be 
uploaded via  the PPR Electronic Registration System. 
 
15.2 Random ization 
 
Randomi zation will be  done at MSKCC. Patients will be randomi zed to the  MF 0.1%  cream 
arm or the standard skin care arm with Eu cerin at the ratio of 1:1.  For patients enrolled at 
MSKCC, after eligibility is established and imm ediately after consent is obt ained, the  RSA 
will register participants in the  PPR system and randomize participants usi ng the Clinical 
Research Database (CRDB), by calling the  MSKCC PPR Office at 646-735-8000  between the 
hours of 8:30 am and 5:30 pm, Monday to Friday. Randomization will be  accomplish ed by the 
method of random  permuted blo ck, and will be  stratified by the presence of breast 
reconstruction and BMI. After treatment arm is determined by randomization, RSAs at 
MSKCC will noti fy the research staff of the participant ID via email wit hin 24 ho urs of 
randomi zation. Since this is a double  blind stu dy, the research participants’ treatment 
assignments can be viewed in the  CRDB only by the hospit al pharmacists who are dispensing 
the study drugs. 
 
15.3 Blinding 
 
Study drug containers will appear identical with assigned numb ers divid ed evenly between 
study drug and control. Details of  which drug is associated with each number will be  recorded 
in a logbook. When a patient is assigned to a  treatment arm based on the  process outlin ed in 
section 15.2, the  pharmacist will obt ain a numb er assignment from CRDB, re-label the cream 
and keep a log recording the  numb er of the jar dispensed. 
 
16.0 DATA MANAGEMENT ISSUES  
 
An RSA will be assign ed to the stu dy, whose responsibilities will include project compliance, 
data collection, abstraction and entry, data reporting, regulatory monit oring, problem resolution 
and prioritization, and coordinating the activities of the protocol study team. 
 
The data collected for this study will be entered into a secure database. Source documentation 
will be  available to sup port the comput erized patient record. 
 
 
 
16.1 Quality Assurance  
 
Weekly registration reports will be generated to monitor  patient accruals and completeness 
of registration data. Routine data quality reports will be generated to assess missing  data 
and inconsist encies. Accrual rates, and extent and accuracy of evaluations  and follow -up, 
will be monito red periodically throughout  the study period and potential problems will be 
brought to  the attention of  the study team for discussion and action.

 16.2    Data and Safety Monitoring 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at MSKCC were approved by the  National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) in September 2001. The plans address the new policies set forth by 
the NCI in the document entitled “Policy of the National Cancer Institute for Data and 
Safety Monito ring of Clinical Trials,” which can be found  at 
http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/g rantspoli cies/datasafety.htm. The DSM Plans at MSKCC were 
established and are monito red by the Office of Clinical Research. The MSKCC DSM Plans 
can be found on  the MSKCC Intranet at http://ms kweb2.m skcc.org/irb/ind ex.htm.  
 
There are several different mechanisms by which clinical trials are monito red for data, 
safety, and quality. There are institution al processes in place for quality assurance (e.g., 
protocol monito ring, compliance and data verification audits, therapeutic response, and staff 
education on clinical research quality assurance) and departmental procedures for quality 
control, plus there are two institution al committees that are responsible  for monito ring the 
activities of our clinical trials programs: the Data and Safety Monito ring Committee for 
Phase I and II clinical trials, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board for Phase III clinical 
trials, reporting to the Center’s Research Council and Institution al Review Board (IRB). 
 
During the protocol developm ent and review process, each protocol will be assessed for its 
level of risk and degree of monitoring required. Every type of protocol (e.g., National 
Institut es of Health sponso red, in-house  sponso red, industrial sponsored, NCI cooperative 
group, etc.) will be addressed and the monito ring procedures will be established at the time 
of protocol activation. 
 
 
17.0 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
The procedures involved in this study are felt to be of minim al risk, meaning that the probability 
and magnitude  of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of 
themselves than those  ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine 
physical or psychologi cal examinations  or tests. The benefit derived from the study would be 
prevention  of moderate to severe skin toxi cities in breast cancer patients undergoing  chest wall 
radiation.  Patients  or  their  legal  guardians  will  receive  comprehensive  explanation  of  the 
proposed treatment options being offered on this protocol, including the nature of the 
investigation, rationale, alternative treatments and any known previously observed side effects, 
the investigational nature of the stu dy, and the potential benefits and risks of the int ervention. 
Participation in this trial is volunt ary.  All  patients will be required to sign  a  statement of 
informed consent, which must conform to IRB guidelines. 
 
 
17.1    Privacy 
 
MSKCC’s Privacy Office may allow the  use and disclosure of protected health in formation 
pursuant to a  compl eted and si gned Research Au thorization form. The  use and dis closure of 
protected health in formation will be  limited to the  individu als described in the  Research 
Autho rization form. A Research Autho rization form must be  compl eted by the Principal

subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII])
Visit 5 estimated Glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as calculated by the 
Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD -EPI) formula 
(< 60 mL/min/1.73 m2vs ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2)
Visit 5 glycat ed haemoglobin (HbA 1c, < 8.5% vs ≥8.5%)
participation in the CGM substudy (CGM participation versus non -CGM 
participation )

Endpoints Primary endpoint is the change from baseline in HbA 1cafter 26 w eeks
Key secondary endpoints are:
incidence rate of symptomatic hypoglycaemic adverse events ( AEs)with 
confirmed plasma glucose < 54 mg/dL (< 3.0 mmol/L) and/or severe 
hypoglycaemic AEs per patient -year from  Week 5 to Week 26
osevere hypoglycaemic AEs are defined as events requiring the assistance 
of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon or other 
corrective actions.  Plasma glucose concentrations may not be available 
during an ev ent, but neurological recovery following the return of plasma 
glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was 
induced by a low  plasma glucose concentration 
incidence rate of symptomatic hypoglycaemic AEs with confirmed plasma 
glucos e < 54 mg/dL (< 3.0 mmol/L) and/or severe hypoglycaemic AEs per 
patient -year from Week 1 to Week 26
change from baseline in body weight (kg) after 26 w eeks
change from baseline in total daily insulin dose (TDID), U/kg, after 26 w eeks
change from baseline in systolic blood pressure (SBP) after 26 w eeks
change from baseline in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) after 26 w eeks
Safety criteria: Incidence rate of symptomatic hypoglycaemic AEs with confirmed plasma glucose 
< 54 mg/dL (< 3.0 mmol/L) and/or severe hypoglycaemic AEs per patient -year 
from Week 1 to Week 4

Frequency of patients with adjudicated events:
cardiovascular events
severe hypoglycaemia
DKA
Statistical m ethods: For the primary endpoint, change from baseline in HbA 1cafter 26 w eeks, restricted 
maximum likelihood estimation based on mixed -effect model for repeated 
measures (MMRM) analysis will be used to obtain adjusted means for the 
treatment effects. This model will include treatment, week and pre -existing insulin 
therapy as discrete fixed effects, baseline eGFR (CKD -EPI) and baseline HbA 1cas 
continuous fixed effects, as well as the interaction between week and treatment and 
the interaction between week and baseline HbA 1c.  The initial primary treatment 
comparisons will be the Bonferroni adjusted contrast betw een the doses of 
empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg and placebo at Week 26.  The doses of 
empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg w ill therefore be tested at the level of α=0.025 (tw o-
sided).
The primary analysis will be an eff icacy analysis, including on -treatment data only.  
Follow ing the efficacy analysis, an effectiveness analysis (on -and off- treatment 
data) w ill be performed in a hierarchical manner.  If the null hypothesis is rejected 
for both the efficacy and effectivenes s analysis then the primary endpoint (betw een 
empagliflozin 2.5 mg and placebo , on-treatment data only) and the key secondary 
endpoints will be tested in a confirmatory way using a gatekeeping approach, w ith 
unequal splitting of the alpha, and sequential testing.
The key secondary endpoints of change from baseline in body weight after 26 
weeks and change from baseline in TDID w ill be analysed using a similar model to 
the analysis of the primary endpoint, w ith the addition of baseline and interaction 
betw een baseline and week for the respective endpoint.
The key secondary endpoint of incidence rate of symptomatic hypoglycaemic AEs 
with confirmed plasma glucose < 54 mg/dL (< 3.0 mmol/L) and/or severe 
hypoglycaemic AEs from Week 5 to Week 26 w ill be analysed using a negative 
binomial model.  The model will include treatment and pre -existing insulin therapy 
as discrete fixed effects, baseline rate, baseline HbA 1cand baseline eGFR as 
continuous fixed effects and logarithm of days of exposure as an offset.  The
primary treatment comparisons will be the rate ratios comparing the incidence rates 
per-patient year from Week 5 to Week 26 on each dose of empagliflozin to 
placebo.  The same analysis strategy will be applied for the key secondary endpoint 
of incidence r ate of symptomatic hypoglycaemic AEs with confirmed plasma 
glucose < 54 mg/dL (< 3.0 mmol/L) and/or severe hypoglycaemic events from 
Week 1 to Week 26.
The key secondary endpoints of change from baseline in SBP and DBP after 26 
weeks will be analysed using a similar model to the analysis of the primary

A Permitted visit windows should be strictly adhered to, to ensure laboratory results from a preceding visit are available by the time of the next visit, and to ensure a 
sufficient supply of medication until the next visit.  For patients participating in the CG M substudy, the time span between Visit 5 (Day -14) and Visit 6 (Day 1) should 
ideally be exactly 14 days ; the time span between Visit 6 (Day 1) and Visit 8 (Day 29) should ideally be exactly 28 days; the time span between Visit 11 CGM and Visit 
11EOT shou ld ideally be exactly 14 days . For further details see Section 6.1
B The patient’s therapy for T1DM (e.g. ability to review blood glucose values, skills for carbohydrate estimation and insulin adjustment) should be optimised from V isit 2 
for a period of 6 weeks (i.e. until the patient reaches Visit 5 and the placebo run -in period) to achieve the best standard of care in accordance with local guidelines.  This 
optimal therapy should then be continued from Visit 5 for eligible patient s.  For further details see Section 4.2.1
C During the T1DM therapy optimisation period, and daily for 5 days following clinic Visit 6, data from the electronic (e)-diary should be reviewed remotely by designated 
site personnel, paying particular attention to adjustments in the insulin regimen, glucose values and, if available, ketone measurements.  In addition, the patient should be 
contacted by telephone (e.g. weekly during the T1DM therapy optimisation period) if e -diary data, including glucose data, is not available and/or if the data suggests 
closer monitoring of the patient is required.  Additional clinic visits can also be arranged if necessary.  For further detai ls see Sections 5.2.3 and 6.2.1
D Visit 4T is a telephone visit . Visit 3 can be a telephone visit (3T), if deemed sufficient based on Investigator judgement, or a clinic visit; if performed as a telephone visit, 
assessments in brackets in the Flow Chart do not have to be performed
E Visit 5 includes a 9-point plasma glucose profile on Day -2.  No clinic visit is required on this day, as the 9-point plasma glucose profile will be performed by the patient 
at home.  For further details see Footnote Nand Section 5.2.6

01-MCS -40-106-RD-03(11.0)/Saved on:24Jul2014F Following randomisation and prior to the initiation of study medication, Investigators are advised to reduce the patient’s total insulin dose based on need/ by 10% to avoid 
hypoglycaemia; thereafter further insulin adjustments may be implemented as necessary.  For further details see Section 4.2.1
G An early End of Treatment (eEOT) Visit, as well as a Follow -up Visit 12, should be performed for any patient who discontinues study medication prematurely; the eEOT 
Visit should be completed as soon as possible after study medication is stopped.   
the 9-point plasma glucose profile should only be performed if it is feasible for it to be done over a 24 hour period before the eE OT visit 
when study medication is still being taken; otherwise it can be omitted.  Visit 12 should be performed 3 weeks after the eEOT visit, and where possible, patients s hould 
then be followed up according to the visit schedule.  For further details see Section 6.2.3
H NF:non-fasting; F: fasting
I Following the termination of trial medication, and if deemed necessary based on Investigator’s judgement, additional support (e.g. telephone interaction) can be given to 
the patient during the adjustment of T1DM therapy in the Fo llow-up period  
J Safety laboratory includes calculation of the eGFR.  Following a positive urine dipstick result (at the site) for leukocyte e sterase (for WBC) or nitrite, a midstream urine 
sample for urine culture is triggered.  For further details see Section 5.3.3
K For female patients of child -bearing potential (local urine pregnancy test)
 
 
 
 
O Home monitoring device: meter for monitoring of blood (plasma) glucose and ketone levels at home
P Self-Blood Glucose Monitoring (SBGM) should be performed daily from the beginning of the T1DM therapy optimisat ion period to the end of the Follow -up period.  
Measurements should be taken 4 times a day as a minimum e.g. at least before breakfast , lunch, dinner and bedtime.  Additional measurements will also be warranted (e.g. 
after clinic Visit 6).  For further details see Section 5.3.2.1 .  Ketone measurements should be performed by the patient in case of any symptoms of DKA.  Other conditions 
may also trigger the need for ketone measurement.  For further details see Section 5.3.2.2
Q  
R For the screening visit (Visit 1) an abbreviated, safety laboratory and urinalysis will be performed as follows: liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine, 
TSH, and urinalysis.  For further details see Section 5 .3.3
S At Visits 6, 11 EOT , eEOT (if applicable) and 12 only, the safety laboratory testing will include lipids.  Samples should be obtained from the patient in a fasting state.  For 
further details see Section 5.3.3
 
U For Visit 2, an abbreviated safety laboratory (fastin g) will be performed as follows: C-peptide , beta -hydroxy -buty rate, bicarbonate and electrolytes only.  For fu rther 
details see Section 5.3.3

MEDICAL BACKGROUND 1.1
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) accounts for 5 to 10% of all cases of diabetes mellitus.  
This disease is a complex disorder that requires constant attention to diet, exercise, glucose 
monitoring, and insulin therap y to achieve good glycaemic control.  T1DM occurs as a 
consequence of the organ -specific immune destruction of the pancr eas’ insulin -producing β -
cells in the islets of Langerhans [ R10-6370, R10 -6371].
Controlling blood glucose in T1DM leads to improved patient outcomes [ R04-2186, R12 -
1489 ].  For this reason, several medical associations have given treatment recommendations 
for T1DM [ P13-05979, R12 -4773] including gl ycaemic goals.  Most bodies reco mmend that 
adult patients with T1DM should obtain gly cated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) ≤7.0%.  However, 
despite advances in insulin formulation and delivery , such as the development of continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) s ystems, refinement of pharmac okinetic (PK) properties 
of rapid -and long -acting insulin analogues, and the use of continuous glucose monitoring 
(CGM) sy stems, current therapy  for patients with diabetes requiring insulin often does not 
lead to satisfactory  glycaemic control.  In fact, only a minor portion of patients achieve 
normalisation of HbA 1cand restoration of eugl ycaemia.  Most patients generall y achieve 
HbA 1clevels no lower than 8.0%.  Hence, with the currently  available treatment options, 
patients with T1DM often fail to maint ain adequate blood glucose control.  This may  not onl y 
lead to acute conditions such as h ypergl ycaemia and ketoacidosis, but may  also lead to 
debilitating secondary  complications including heart disease, blindness and kidney  failure 
[R10-6369].  I n addition, inadvertent excessive administration of insulin may also contribute 
to acute conditions such as severe h ypogl ycaemia.
Empagliflozin is a reversible, highl y potent (IC 501.3 nM) and selective competitive inhibitor 
of sodium- glucose co- transporter 2 (SGLT -2), a member of a larger group of sodium 
substrate co- transporters, the sodium -glucose co- transport 5 (SL C5) gene family  [R05-0939].  
Under normogl ycaemia, glucose is completel y reabsorbed b y SGLTs in the kidney , whereas 
the reuptake capacit y of the kidney  is saturated at plasma glucose concentrations higher than 
approximately  10-11mmol/L , resulting in glucosuria.  This threshold concentration can be 
decreased b ySGLT -2 inhibition [ c01678844]; an approximately  5000- fold selectivity  over 
human SGL T-1 (IC 506278 nM), responsible for glucose absorption in the gut, was calculated
for empagliflozin [ U06-1742].
It was demonstrated, nearly  four decades ago, that in patients with poorly  controlled T1DM, 
the maximum tubular reabsorption capacit y for glucose was significantly increased, whereas 
one would in fact have suspected that during h ypergly caemia, with increased interstitial and 
intracel lular glucose concentrations, the reduced glucose concentration gradient across the 
basolateral membrane of the proximal renal epithelial cell would attenuate glucose efflux 
[R10-6572].  This paradoxically  increased glucose rea bsorption in T1DM could be explained 
by an up -regulation of glucose transporters, including SGLT- 2 which was shown in tubular 
cells cultured from patients with T ype 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [ R10-0703 ].  The 
phenomenon of an i ncreased reabsorption of glucose when glucose concentration is elevated

01-MCS -40-106-RD-03(11.0)/Saved on:24Jul2014could therefore be considered a maladapted response to glucosuria in diabetes, since it would 
rather be desirable for the kidney  to excrete the excess filtered glucose load in order to restore 
normogl ycaemia [ P11-10364].
Based on these pathoph ysiological considerations, it follows that empagliflozin has the 
potential to provide a novel approach to the treatment of T1DM, as adjunctive therap y to 
insulin.  E mpagliflozin lowers both the saturation threshold and the transport maximum of 
SGL T-2 for glucose, resulting in increased glucosuria, insulin -independent reduction of 
plasma glucose levels with potentially  low risk of hy poglycaemia, and negative energy  
balance with poten tial weight reduction in T1DM.
DRUG PROFILE 1.2
Empagliflozin is a novel, orally  available, potent, and selective inhibitor of the renal SGLT -2.  
Its selective inhibition reduces renal reabsorption of glucose and promotes increased urinary 
glucose excretion (UGE) resulting in redu ction of blood glucose levels.
Empagliflozin has been developed for the treatment of T2DM, and has received marketing 
approval in various regions including the European Union and the USA where it is marketed 
under the brand name Jardiance®.
1.2.1 Non-clinical assessment of safety
For further information regarding pre -clinical evaluation, please refer to the current version 
of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for empagliflozin [ c01678844].
1.2.2 Clinical pharmacokinetics
Clinical pharmacokinetics – Type 2 diabetes mellitus 1.2.2.1
In humans, empagliflozin predominantly showed linear PK.  Empagliflozin reaches peak 
levels at approximately  1.5 hours and showed a biphasic decline with the terminal elimination 
half-life of 12.4 hours ranging from 10 to 19 hours.
Empagliflozin exposure increases with renal or hepatic impairment; however, no dose 
adjustment is recommended as the observed changes in exposure were not clinically  
meaningful.  The observations from a Phase I study  in patients with renal impairment indicate 
a rather low gly caemic efficacy  of empagliflozin in patients with severe renal impairment and 
end-stage renal disease, while efficacy  is assumed to be unchanged with hepatic impairment.
No clinical ly relevant PK interactions were observed with other oral antidiabetics, warfarin, 
verapamil, ramipril, simvastatin, digoxin, hy drochlorothiazide, torasemide, gemfibrozil, 
rifampicin, probenecid and oral contraceptives (Microgy non®).

1.2.3 Clinical efficacy and safety 
Clinical efficacy and safety  –Type 2 diabetes mellitus 1.2.3.1
Empagliflozin hasbeen studied as part of a global development program with 15582 patients 
with T2DM treated in clinical studies of which 10004 were treated with empagliflozin, either 
alone or in combination with metf ormin, a sulfonylurea, a PPARγ agonist, dipeptidy l 
peptidase -4inhibitors, or insulin.
The Phase III studies in T2DM showed that treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg 
once dail y for up to 24 weeks results in a reduction of HbA 1cup to 0.85%, body  weight up to 
2.2kg and s ystolic blood pressure (SBP) up to 4.8 mmHg compared with placebo.  This was 
consistently  observed with empagliflozin as monotherapy , add on to metformin, to metformin 
and sulphony lurea, to pioglitazone with or without metformin, and to basal insulin with 
metformin and/or sulphony lurea.  Phase III studies up to 104 weeks in T2DM support the 
sustained effect of empagliflozin.
In clinical studies, empagliflozin was well tolerated in both normal healthy  volunteers and 
patients with T2DM up to maximal treatment duration of 104 weeks in completed studies.  
The frequency  of overall Adverse Events (AEs), AEs leading to discontinuation and Serious 
AE (SAEs) were comparable to placebo.  There was no significant increase in frequency  of 
hypogly caemia with empagliflozin compared to placebo except when used in combination 
with a sulphony lurea or basal insulin.  I n general there was a small increase in frequency  of 
urinary  tract infection (UTI) compared to placebo.  There was an increase in frequen cy of 
genital infections with the use of empagliflozin.  There was a small increase in total 
cholesterol, low -densit y lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high -densit y lipoprotein (HDL) 
cholesterol and no significant changes in trigl ycerides.  No changes in e lectroly tes were 
observed with empagliflozin.  There was a reduction in eGFR which gradually  returned 
toward baseline values over the treatment period in the trials.  Furthermore, eGFR returned to 
baseline when empagliflozin was discontinued.  In a dedicat ed study  in patients with 
moderate renal impairment (eGFR between 30 -60mL/min/1.73 m2) treatment with 
empagliflozin was well tolerated and led to statistically significant reduction of HbA 1c and 
clinically  meaningful improvement in FPG (fasting plasma glu cose), body  weight and BP 
compared to placebo at Week 24.  Similar results were sustained for up to 52 weeks 
[c01678844].

safet y, tolerabilit y and efficacy seen in the clinical study programs to date, the available 
clinical and non -clinical data support safe and efficacious use in humans and further 
development of empagliflozin in T1DM and T2DM.

ASSESSMENT
RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL 2.1
In an extensive Phase III program, empagliflozin (10 mg and 25 mg) was shown to be safe 
and efficacious in the treatment of patients with T2DM and has received marketing approval 
in more than 30 countries including the EU and US.  Due to its insulin -independent mode of 
action empagliflozin also has potential for use in the treatment of patients with T1DM.   
, this 
Phase III trial is planned to confirm the efficacy  and safet y of empagliflozin in patients with 
T1DM and to further investigate tolerability  and PK.
TRIAL OBJECTIVES 2.2
The objective of this study  is to assess the efficacy, safet y, tolerabilit y and PK of once dail y 
oral doses of empagliflozin 2.5 mg, 10 mg and 25 mg compared to placebo in patients with 
T1DM as adjunctive to insulin therapy .
BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT 2.3
A pha rmacologic rationale for the use of empagliflozin in T1DM can be found in Section 1.1.  
The overall tolerability  and safet y profile outlined in Section 1.2, and the current IB, supports 
chronic administration of empagliflozin 2.5 mg, 10 mg and 25 mg in human studies.
According to the medication assignment planned in this trial, 75% of the patients will receive 
empagliflozin , and 25% of patients will be assigned to placebo.  For those assigned to 
empaglifloz in, patients may benefit from positive gl ycaemic effects.  In addition to achieving 
better gly caemic control, patients receiving empagliflozin are expected to benefit from a 
reduced number and intensity  of hy poglycaemic events due to a reduced need for 
insulin/reduced glucose excursions (since when using insulin only , its subcutaneous 
administration often leads to over- insulination ultimately  causing hy pogly caemia).  
Nevertheless, patients will be closely  monitored for hy poglycaemic episodes throughout the 
trial, and the frequency  of this monitoring will be adjusted in accordance with the anticipated 
risk (including night- time glucose measurements during the first day s after initiation of the 
study  medication).  Patients assigned to both empagliflozin and pl acebo may  also derive 
general medical benefit from careful and close monitoring b y medical personnel during the 
study .  Placebo patients may  benefit from optimising the therapy  for T1DM as part of the 
T1DM therap y optimisation period.
As part of the prepa ration for entry  into the randomised treatment period, therapy  for T1DM 
will be optimised (e.g. review of blood glucose values, insulin dose and its adjustment for 
meals, ability  to carbohydrate count etc.) over a 6 week period (T1DM therapy  optimisation 
period) to ensure that, in the I nvestigator’s opinion, a patient is achieving the best standard of 
care in accordance with local guidelines before entering the randomised treatment period of 
the trial.  This optimal t herap y will then be continued, and at randomisation, I nvestigators are

01-MCS -40-106-RD-03(11.0)/Saved on:24Jul2014advised to reduce the patient’s total insulin dose based on need/ by 10% to minimise the risk 
for h ypoglycaemia.  Since glomerular filtration is physiologicall y decreased during episode s 
of severe h ypogl ycaemia (due to reduced renal blood flow hence leading to lowering of urine 
glucose excretion and therefore efficacy  of empagliflozin), hy poglycaemia induced b y insulin 
is not expected to be significantly  aggravated by  empagliflozin [ R12-4766].
Special attention will be paid to prevent T1DM -inherent DKA.  Due to the mechanism of 
action, empagliflozin may  potentiall y modify  the clinical presentation of DKA.  Patients 
receiving empagliflozin may  be at risk to underestimate their need for insulin if blood sugar 
levels are within individual target ranges or onl y slightly elevated.  Insulin deficiency might 
lead to ketoacidosis which could be life -threatening if not recognised and appropriatel y 
treated.  All patient s will be made aware of this risk and be instructed not to reduce their 
insulin dose below Investigator recommendations.  I n addition to blood glucose monitoring, 
the frequency  of which will be increased after starting the study  medication (for further 
details see Section 5.3.2.1 ), in the same way  as during routine clinical care, patients will be 
reminded how to determine ketones in case of an y sympto ms of DKA, e.g.nausea, vomiting ,
abdominal pain etc.  They  will be instructed to do this irrespective of the glucose value in the 
event of DKA sy mptoms occurring.  More frequent ketone testing (e.g. once dail y) will be 
recommended during the run- in period and during the first 4 weeks of the treatment period; 
this will allow patients and I nvestigators to understand baseline ketosis rates and compare 
them, as appropriate, to the incidence of ketosis following the initiation of study  medication.  
A meter will be provided to the patient for this purpose ; as an additional safeguard, the meter 
will also be used to check ketone levels at most clinic visits (see Flow Chart ).  Patients will 
be reminded of the interpretation of ketone values measured by  the meter, and on appropriate 
action to be taken in the event of increased ketone levels (see Section 5.3.2.2). In addition, 
patients will be reminded about insulin adjustment during “sick day s”and about the
importance of keeping themselves hy drated .
Investigators should also differentiate deteriorating ketosis/DKA from an y mild to moderate 
increase of ketones which may  be seen due to the mechanism of action of empagliflozin, 
especiall y in the fasted state (e.g. in the morning).  See also Section 1.2.3.2.
Patients will be carefull y selected for the trial in line with the eligibility  criteria, to ensure, in 
the Investigator’s judgement, that they  have a good understanding of their disease and how to 
manage it.  They  should a lso be selected in terms of their ability  to be compliant with the 
demands of the trial.  This means, for example, that patients should be able to lead the 
optimisation of their T1DM therap y since they  are judged to have sound self- management 
skills and approaches to insulin dose adjustment, and are reliable in terms of performing 
frequent home testing of both glucose and ketones when required.
As with all drugs, the potential for h ypersensitivity and allergic reactions has to be taken into 
consideration w hen empagliflozin is administered.  Other risks to the patients are the risks 
inherent to an y investigational medicinal product used in a clinical trial setting, such as 
unexpected adverse clinical or laboratory  events.

certain hepatic events will be performed in this trial.  Furthermore, adjudication of 
cardiovascular events, severe h ypogl ycaemia and DKA will be performed.  The pro gress of 
the trial will also be assessed at regular intervals by  an independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC).  For further details please refer to Section 3.1.1.1.
Based on the findings in non-clinical studies conducted to date, and in accordance with 
international regulatory  guidelines, the inclusion of women of child- bearing potential in this 
trial is justified.  To minimise the risk of unintentional exposure of an embryo or foetus to the 
investigational drug, women of child -bearing potential must agree to the requirements for 
pregnancy  testing and contraceptive methods described in this protocol (for further details see 
Section 3.3.3).
Safety  will be carefull y assessed by monitoring the patients for AEs clinically , by laboratory  
testing and b y blood glucose and ketone monitoring.  The Investigator will have the 
discretion to remove patients from the study  should there be any  safety  concerns or if the 
patient’s wellbeing is at jeopard y.
The potency , selectivity , and efficacy  in various animal models and the PD data from studies 
in healthy  volunteers and patients with diabetes suggest that empagliflozin may  be able to 
provide a valuable benefit to patients with T1DM.
Given the positive risk -benefit ratio for empagliflozin to date, the careful selection of patients 
and their monitoring during the stud y, the blood glucose and ketone monitoring performed b y 
the patients at home and the option to adjust a patient’s insulin treatment, the Sponsor 
considers the benefit -risk assessment for the use of empagliflozin in T1DM patients in this 
trial to be favourable.

OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN 3.1
This multi -national, randomised, placebo -controlled, double -blind, parallel group stud y 
compares 3 doses of empagliflozin ( 2.5 mg, 10 mg and 25 mg) to placebo in patients with 
T1DM as adjunctive to insulin therapy .  In total, 960patients with T1DM who meet the entry  
criteria will be entered (randomised) in the trial.  T he randomised treatment will be double -
blind .  A triple -dummy  design will be used for masking the treatment assignment, i.e. each 
patient will take 3 tablets a day , receiving 1 active treatment and 2placebo matching the 
alternative active treatments, or 3 placebos matching the alternative treatments.
Patients will be enrolled (screened) in the trial once they  have signed the informed consent. 
All patients who are suitable a fter screening will undergo a 6 week T1DM therapy  
optim isation period, followed b ya 2week open -label placebo run -in period before 
randomisation.  Patients who successfull y complete both of these periods and who still meet 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomised into the 26 week double -blind treatment 
period in which they  will receive either one of the 3 doses of empagliflozin or placebo in 
addition to their regular insulin therapy .
About 30% of the patients will take part in a CGM substudy . In addition to the regular trial 
assessments, these patients will have 4CGM period of 2 weeks each (Week -2 to Week -
1, 
Week 1 to 2, Week 3 to 4 and Week 25 to 26). This substudy  will be conducted at selected 
trial sites which are experienced with CGM. Participation in the substudy  will be optional for 
patients at these sit es.
After the 26 week treatment period, all patients will enter a 3 week follow -up period during 
which they  will not be treated with study  medication.  During this period all AEs need to be 
collected, documented and reported.  The patient’s participation is concluded when they  have 
undergone the last planned visit (i.e. Trial Completion/Visit 12); last -patient -last-visit-
primary -endpoint will occur when all patients have completed 26 weeks of treatment.  The 
end of the trial is defined as “last patient out ” (i.e. last Visit 12 completed by  the last patient 
in the trial).  For further details regarding the definition of the end of the trial, please see 
Section 8.6
.

Certain hepatic events will be adjudicated b y external independent experts for severit y and 
causal relationship with the trial medication in a blinded fash ion.  The events which will be 
reviewed will be defined in a charter.  Events may  either be defined by  abnormal laboratory  
values and/or relevant adverse events or both.  For example, assessments will be made for 
events of hepatic injury , including liver e nzyme elevations.
For qualify ing events, relevant source documents generated from any medical evaluations of 
these events will be requested including laboratory  values, histological analy sis, results of 
ultrasound, CT, MRI , scintigraph y, hospital discharg e letters, and medical reports from other 
physicians.  All evaluations will be performed in a blinded fashion.  The assessments will be 
analysed based on empagliflozin data combined from multiple trials (i.e. on project level).
DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUD ING THE CHOICE OF 3.2
CONTROL GROUP
This trial will investigate the efficacy , safety and tolerability of empagliflozin in patients with 
T1DM, as adjunctive to insulin therapy , and will further characterise the PK.
The trial design was chosen according to the FDA’s “Guidance for Industry , Diabetes 
Mellitus: Developing Drugs and Therapeutic Biologics for Treatment and Prevention” [ R08-
2669 ].  According to this guideline, insulin is the essential glucose -lowering therapy  for 
patients with T1DM.  All experimental T1DM treatments that are not insulin analogues or 
other insulin receptor ligands should be studied as add- on therapies to insulin.  Consequently , 
in this trial empagliflozin and matching placebo will be administered as a dd-on to an existing 
insulin therapy .  Treatment with MDI  of insulin or CSII (i.e. insulin pump therapy ) are held 
as the practical gold standard for the treatment of T1DM [ P13-
05979].
A 6 week T1DM therap y optimisation period , followed b y a 2week placebo run -in period is 
deemed appropriate to screen out non -compliant patients, and to capture a “true” baseline 
incidence rate of h ypogl ycaemia ,together with optimal insulin use .
HbA 1cas the primary endpoint has been demonstrated to be a reflection of the gl ycaemic 
control over the preceding 12 weeks and maintenance data o ver a period of approximately  
6months are requested by  the different regulatory agencies.  Therefore the primary  endpoint 
is the change from baseline in HbA 1cafter 26 weeks of randomised treatment.
The3 week foll
ow-up
period is considere d to be sufficient, as pre vious st udies with
empagliflozin have shown that its’PDeffect only extends to a bout three days after the la st
dose.  Furthermo re, it w ill allow for the assessment of rev ersibility of unex pected long- term
side effects.
Use of a placebo group is deemed acceptable since it is expected that the insulin therapy 
requirement of patients receiving placebo will remain unchanged compared to their treatment 
before randomisation.

01-MCS -40-106-RD-03(11.0)/Saved on:24Jul2014The rationale for dose and dose -interval selection is described in Section 4.1.3 .
SELECTION OF TRIAL P OPULATION 3.3
A sufficient number of male and female patients with T1DM will be screened to ensure the 
randomisation of 960 patients from around 180trial sites.
It is expected that around 5 patients will be randomised at each trial site.  If enrolment is 
delay ed, addi tional sites may  be recruited.  Permission to enrol more than 36 patients per site 
must be obtained from the TCM at BI.  This will only  be allowed after a careful review of the 
enrolment status and of the site.
Screening of patients for this trial is competitive across all countries within the trial, i.e. 
screening for the trial will stop at all sites when it is anticipated that a sufficient number of 
patients have been screened to y ield the desired number of pati ents randomised to trial 
treatment.  Investigators will be notified when sufficient patients have been screened and 
when screening is complete, and will not be allowed to recruit additional patients for the 
study .  Patients who have completed Visit 1 procedures prior to notification of the 
termination of recruitment will be allowed to continue in the study , if they  meet all entry  
criteria and they  are able to follow the visit schedule specified in this Clinical Trial Protocol 
(CTP).
A log of all patients e nrolled into the trial (i.e. who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the I SF at the investigational site irrespective of whether they  have been treated 
with investigational drug or not.
3.3.1 Main diagnosis for trial entry

repeated h ypoglycaemic episodes or DKA that, in the I nvestigator’s opinion, may  put the 
patient at risk with continued participation
If a patient becomes pregnant during the trial the study  medication will be stopped, the 
patient will be discontinued from the trial and the patient will be followed up until birth or 
otherwise termination of the pregnancy .
A patient can be discontinued afte r discussion between Sponsor and Investigator if eligibility  
criteria are being violated, or if the patient fails to comply  with the protocol (e.g. non-
attendance at study  assessments).
Patients who drop out during the screening, T1DM therap y optimisation, or run -in periods 
prior to randomisation will be considered screening failures.  They will be recorded as 
screening failures in the Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF )and no further follow -up is 
required.  The data will be included in the trial database and will be reported.
Patients who discontinue the trial treatment or withdraw from the study  after randomisation 
will be considered as “early  discontinuations” and the reason for this premature 
discontinuation of trial treatment or withdrawal from the st udy must be recorded in the eCRF.  
The data will be included in the trial database and will be reported.
For the anal ysis of this trial it is absolutely  crucial that all planned assessments are done as 
planned, even if patients discontinue trial treatment .Patients who discontinue treatment 
prematurel y and who do not withdraw their informed consent must therefore be followed up 
for the intended regular treatment period.  All assessments related to the primary  and 
secondary  endpoints must be performed as if the patient would have remained on treatment.  
Details of procedures to be followed for patients prematurel y terminating the trial treatment 
can be found in Section 6.2.3.
Patients who discontinue or withdraw from the study after randomisation will not be 
replaced.
Discontinuation of the trial by  the Sponsor 3.3.4.2
BI reserves the right to discontinue the trial overall or at a particular trial site at an y time for 
the following reasons:
Failure to meet expected enrolment goals ov erall or at a particular trial site
Emergence of an y efficacy /safet y information invalidating the earlier positive benefit -
risk-assessment that could significantl y affect the continuation of the trial
Violation of GCP, the CTP, or the contract disturbing the appropriate conduct of the trial
The Investigator / the trial site will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in case of 
trial termination (except in case of the third reason).

4.1.2 Method of assigning patients to treatment groups
When a patient is qualified for entry into the randomised double- blind treatment period, 
treatment assignment will be by  means of a third- party  randomisation s ystem at Visit 6, 
Day 1.  This will involve the use of IRT, which will take into consideration the relevant 
stratification factors.  To facilitate the use of IRT, the I nvestigator will receive all necessary  
instructions and/or documents for using the IRT.
Patients will be randomly  assigned, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, to either:
(i) empagliflozin 2.5 mg
(ii) empagliflozin 10 mg 
(iii) empagliflozin 25 mg 
(iv) placebo  
For further details refer to Section 7.6.
Patient assignment to the treatment groups will be determined b y a computer generated 
random sequence.  Access to the randomisation cod e will be controlled and documented.  For 
further details please refer to Sections 4.1.5.1 and4.1.5.2.
The kit(s) corresponding to the assigned medication number(s) should be given to the patient 
and the number of the kit(s) that was/were dispensed will be entered in the eCRF.  Using this 
procedure, relevant parties will be blinded to the treatment group assignment.
4.1.3 Selection of doses in the trial
The exposure response relationship between empaglif lozin and UGE was evaluated for 
patients with T1DM (for further details please refer to Section 1.2.2 ).  Results indicate that 
near maximal effects are achieved with empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg once daily ; these 
findings are co mparable to those observed in patients with T2DM.  I t is concluded that there 
are no clinically  relevant differences in PK/PD between the T1DM and T2DM populations

4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
The treatments to be evaluated are outlined in Table 4.1.4: 1 below.  Patients who qualify  will 
be randomised to one of the dosage and treatment schedules described.  Except for the open -
label run-in period, trial medication will be dispensed in a double- blind manner.
All patients will be assigned place bo at the beginning of the placebo run -in period (Visit 5) 
and dispensing will occur once within this period.  Dispensing of kits for the double -blind 
treatment will begin at Visit 6.  Dispensing will occur on 4 occasions as indicated in the Flow 
Chart , covering a period of 26 weeks.  For further details regarding packaging please refer to 
Section 4.1.6 .
The dose of empagliflozin is fixed as shown in Table 4.1.4: 1 below.  Double doses and dose 
reductions are not permitted.  On the other hand, adjustment of a patients’ existing insulin 
therap y is permitted (for further details see Section 4.2.1 ).
From the start of the run -in period, patie nts will be instructed to take their trial medication 
once dail y in the morning with a glass of water.  To ensure a dose interval of about 24 hours, 
the medication should be taken each day  at approximatel y the same time in the morning.

food.
Patients should be i nstructed not to take their trial medication in the morning before visits as 
they will be dosed at the site.  Patients who fail to do so should have the visit rescheduled as 
soon as possible, ideally  on the following day .  Insulin administration (basal and /or bolus) on 
the morning of clinic visits will be left to the discretion of the patient and/or Investigator and 
may be depende nt on planned meal intake etc.  Visits should be routinely  scheduled in the 
morning, at approximately  the same time of day  (e.g. 7am to 11am) for each visit.  The actual 
date and time of administration of the medication at the trial visit will be recorded in the

4.1.5 Blinding and procedures for unblinding
Blinding 4.1.5.1
After randomisation at Visit 6, patients, I nvestigators and every oneinvolved in analy sing or 
with an interest in this double -blind study  will remain blinded with regard to the randomised 
treatment assignments until after database lock.  However, due to the requirements to report 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reacti ons (SUSARs), it may be necessary  for a 
representative from BI’s drug safet y group to access the randomisation code for individual 
patients during study conduct.  I n such cases, access to the code will only  be permitted by  
authorised drug safet y representa tives.  Access to the code will be via the IRT sy stem .
The randomisation code will be kept secret by  Clinical Trial Support at BI up to database 
lock.  Please refer to Section 4.1.5.2 for the rules regarding breaking the code for an 
individual or for all patients in emergency  situations.
The randomisation codes will be provided to bioanaly tics prior to last patient out to allow 
them to exclude PK samples taken from placebo -treated pat ients from the bioanaly tical 
analyses.  Bioanal ytics will not disclose the randomisation code or the results of their 
measurements until the study  is officially  unblinded.
Unblinding and breaking the code 4.1.5.2
Emergency  unblinding will be available to the Investigator /Pharmacist /investigational drug 
storage manager via IRT.  It must only  be used in an emergency  situation when the identity  of 
the trial medication must be known to the Investigator in order to provide appropriate medical 
treatment or otherwise as sure safety  of trial participants.  The reason for unblinding must be 
documented in the source documents and/or appropriate CRF page alo ng with the date of 
unblinding.

Trial medication will be labelled with the trial ide ntification and medication code number.  I t 
will be dispensed as indicated in the Flow Chart .  At each dispensing, an appropriate number 
of tablets (empagliflozin and/or placebo -to-match empagliflozin) plus some reserve will be 
given to the patient.
Supply  and re -suppl y will be managed b y the IRT.  
For details of packaging and the description of the label, refer to the ISF.
4.1.7 Storage conditions
The trial medication must be kept in its tightly  closed original packaging under the 
recommended storage conditions indicated on the label.  A temperature log must be 
maintained by  the Investigator/Pharmacist/investigational drug storage manager to make 
certain that the medication is stored at the correct temperature.  If storage condi tions are 
found to be outside the specified range, the process outlined in the I SF should be followed.
Trial medication must be stored securel y at the study sites, out of reach of children and be 
protected from moisture and direct sunlight, e.g. in a lock ed cupboard or at a Pharmacy .  It 
may only be dispensed to trial patients fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria b y 
authorised study  personnel as documented in the ISF.  Receipt, usage and return of the trial 
medication must also be documented on the respective forms in the ISF.
All unused medication including all packaging, empty  or filled, must be either returned to the 
Sponsor, or, following written authorisation from the Sponsor, may  be destroy ed at site.  
Receipt, usage and return must be documented on the respective forms.  Account must be

maintain records of the product’s deli very to the trial site, the inventory  at the site, the use by  
each patient (see Section 4.1.8.1 below), and the return to the Sponsor or alternative 
disposition of unused product(s).
These records will include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expiry  (‘use by ’) dates, and 
the unique code numbers assigned to the investigational products and trial patients.  The 
Investigator/Pharmacist/investigational drug storage manager will mai ntain records that 
document adequately that the patients were provided the doses specified b y the CTP and 
reconcile all investigational products received from the Sponsor.  At the time of return to the 
Sponsor and/or appointed CRO (Contract Research Organisation), the Investigator/
Pharmacist/investigational drug storage manager must verify  that all unused or partiall y used 
drug supplies have been returned b y the clinical trial patient and that no remaining supplies 
are in the Investigator’s possession.
Patient treatment compliance 4.1.8.1
Patients will be asked to bring all trial medication kits (with or without any  remaining tablets) 
with them to each trial visit.  The tablets will be counted by  the Investigator or a qualified 
designee and compliance will be calcu lated according to the following formula unless there
arereasons to use a different calculation (e.g. to account for periods during which a patient 
was genuinel y unable to take an y trial medication ):

Compliance during the open- label placebo run-in period must be between 80% and 120%.  If 
compliance is outside this range, the patient should not be randomised.
Compliance during the randomised period should also be between 80% and 120%.  Patients 
who are non -compliant according to thi s definition will be treated as protocol violators.  The 
significance of protocol violations will be determined individually  for the purposes of the 
per-protocol anal ysis.
Patients who are not compliant with their medication should again be carefully  interviewed 
and again informed about the purpose and the conduct of the trial.  This discussion should be 
documented.

01-MCS -40-106-RD-03(11.0)/Saved on:24Jul20144.2.1 Rescue medication, emergency proce dures, and additional treatment s
There are no rescue medications in this trial.
All patients will be required to keep their existing insulin therapy  as stable as possible from 
screening at Visit 1 until the beginning of the T1DM therap y optimisation period at Visit 2.  
From Visit 2, therap y for T1DM should be optimised (e.g. review of blood glucose values 
andinsulin dose and its adjustment for meals, improve the patients’ ability  to carbohy drate 
count etc.) over a 6 week period to ensure that, in the Investigator’s opinion, a patient is 
achieving the best standard of care in accordance with local guidelines.  In CSII patients, and 
where considered appropriate, adjustments in T1DM therap y might be supported by basal 
rate testing.
Optimisation of the T1DM therap y should be complete by  the end of the 6 week T1DM 
therap y optimisation period (i.e. b y Visit 5), so that a patient’s insulin regimen is as stable as 
possible as they  enter the placebo run -in period and for 2 weeks prior to r andomisation at 
Visit 6.
During periods of stability, in case of h ypogl ycaemia (e.g. with measured glucose 
concentration ≤ 70 mg/dL [ ≤ 3.9 mmol/L ]), patients should preferably  ingest additional 
carboh ydrates according to standard practice in the managemen t of T1DM.  However, a 
patient’s existing insulin regimen should be adjusted an y time for safet y reasons if deemed 
necessary  by the Investigator, e.g. in case of persisting hypergl ycaemia or hypogly caemia 
despite adequate carboh ydrate intake.
Based on the mode of action of empagliflozin and the results of previous trials in T1DM (for 
further details see Section 1 ), at randomisation on Day  1 (Visit 6) and the initiation of 
randomised study  medication, for patients with an HbA 1cof 7.5 to < 8% at V isit 5,
Investigators are advised to reduce the patient’s total insulin dose by  10% to avoid 
hypoglycaemia.  For patients with an HbA 1cof ≥8% at V isit 5, Investigators are advised to 
adjust the patient’s total insulin dose based on ne edas assessed by frequent SBGM and close 
patient follow-up upon initiation of randomis ed study  medication.  In all cases, t he actual 
reduction will be dependent upon individual glucose values.  Thereafter and until the end of 
the trial (Visit 12), further adjustments to insulin therap y (both basal and bolus insulin) may  
be implemented as necessary  to avoid hy pogly caemia and also hy pergl ycaemia to keep 
ensuring that, in the Investigator’s opinion, the patient is achieving the best standard of care 
in accord ance with local guidelines .
Apart from the recommendation for an initial insulin reduction as mentioned above at the 
start of randomised treatment, there will be no protocol- defined algorithm towards insulin 
adjustment in this trial. However, t he Sponsor will provide additional support to the 
Investigator with respect to insulin adjustment via training documentation that will be 
presented at Investigator Meetings and made available in the I SF.  Throughout the trial, 
adjustment needs to balance a patient’s individual risk for h ypoglycaemia on the one hand 
and the risk for h yperglycaemia and DKA on the other hand with special caution at the 
beginning of the treatment period, and in the Follow-up period, when empagliflozin treatment

01-MCS -40-106-RD-03(11.0)/Saved on:24Jul2014is started and stopped res pectivel y.  Any insulin dose change or adjustment must be based on 
laboratory  tests or SBGM.  However, there are no blood glucose targets defined throughout 
this trial to allow I nvestigators to follow their local standard of care guidelines for the 
managem ent of blood glucose.  Wh enever possible, patients should keep to the same 
trademark and application device for their existing insulin with no intention to change this 
during the trial; for medical/safet y reasons however (e.g. malfunction of a pump in a CSII 
patient), switches in mode of insulin delivery  are permitted.  There should also be no planned 
major changes of the injection sites/areas.
In accordance with Section 3.3.2, I nvestigator’s must ensure that patients selected for the trial 
are capable of leading the management and adjustment of their insulin therapy  when at home, 
including a “sick day ” management plan, and at the same time, can be relied upon to contact 
the Investigator for advice at the appropriate point in time, as this is an outpatient trial.  
Investigator oversight will also be an important element of the insulin adjustment process.
Special attention must be paid to the prevention of DKA.  Due to the mechanism of action, 
patients receiving empagliflozin are at risk to underestimate their need for insulin in case of 
blood sugar levels within their individual target range.  Insulin deficiency  might lead to 
ketoacidosis which could be life- threatening if not recognised and appropriately  treated.  All 
patients must be made aware of this risk and be instructed not to reduce their insulin intake 
below Investigator recommendations.  For further details see Section 2.3.
In addition to performing glucose monitoring, the frequency of which wil l be increased after 
starting the stud y medication (for further details see Section 5.3.2.1), in the same way  as 
during routine clinical care, patients will be reminded to determine ketones in case of an y 
symptoms of DKA, e.g.nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain etc (see Section 5.3.2.2).  They  
will be instructed to do this irrespective of the glucose value in the event of DKA s ymptoms 
occurring.  A meter will be provided to the patient for this purpose.  Patients will also be 
reminded about the interpretation of ketone values measured via the meter, and on 
appropriate action to take in the event of increased ketone levels (see Section 5.3.2.2).  
Ketones should also be determined in case of repeatedly elevated blood glucose levels (e.g. 
> 200 - 240 mg/dL [> 11.1 -13.3 mmol/L ]) which cannot be explained.  Regular (e.g. 2 -3 
times a week) measurements before breakfast are recommended throughout the trial as from 
Visit 2. More frequent (e.g. once dail y) measurements before breakfast are recommended 
during the run
-in period and during the first 4 weeks of the treatment period and might also 
be agreed upon with the patient afterwards if deemed necessary  by the Investigator.  In case 
of a suspected DKA the Investigator should ensure that ap propriate tests are performed at the 
earliest opportunity according to local guidelines, such as a blood gas test (i.e. pH, 
bicarbonate ; the results will be collected on the relevant page of the eCRF ) and that the 
patient is appropriatel y treated (i.e. hospitalized or referred to emergency treatment) 
according to local treatment guidelines .
Other concomitant therapies should be kept as stable as possible over the course of the trial 
but might be changed in case of medical need.  New anti- diabetic therap y should not be 
initiated during the randomised treatment period and the Follow -up period.

There are no special emergency  procedures to be followed.
4.2.2 Restrictions
Restrictions regarding concomitant treatment 4.2.2.1
Treatment with anti- obesity  drugs or s ystemic corticosteroids will be prohibited due to their 
influence on glucose metabol ism.  There are no restrictions on treatment with non -systemic 
corticosteroids such as inhaled or local corticosteroids.
For patients taking th yroid hormones, an y change in the dose should be avoided.  If dose 
changes do occur, then they  should be recorded in the source documents and in the eCRF.
Patients participating in the CGM substudy  must not take an y paracetamol (acetaminophen) 
containing drugs –provided there is no medical necessit y –throughout the CGM monitoring 
periods, since this may  falsely  raise CGM glucose readings.
Restrictions on diet and life sty le 4.2.2.2
Throughout the trial, patients must follow a reliable approach to insulin dose adjustment for 
meals, such as carboh ydrate counting, and based on I nvestigator recommendations.  This 
method will be discussed with the patient at Visit 1 as part of the eligibility checks.
Patients who participate in the CGM substudy  and who alread y use real -time CGM as part of 
their therap y for T1DM may continue t heirown CGM but would also need to wear the 
(blinded) trial CGM in addition during the trial CGM periods.
At the beginning of the T1DM therap y optimisation period (Visit 2), patients will be 
reminded about the appropriate management of their diet and phy sical activity  by the 
Investigator or qu alified site personnel.  This must include a reminder to maintain adequate 
daily  fluid intake to avoid dehy dration.  They  will also be reminded about the importance of 
following a “sick day ” management plan and corresponding insulin adjustments, should the y 
become unwell during the trial.  This discussion will be based on local recommendations for 
individuals with T1DM and should be evident from source documents (see 
Section 8.3.1).  
Site-specific tools may  be used where necessary .  Patients will be reminded to follow the 
recommended dietary  and phy sical activity  plan during the stud y.Extreme diets (e.g. 
ketogenic diets such as the Atkins diet ) should be avoided.
Patients must not take any  other investigational drug within 30 da ys before Visit 1 until the 
last visit (Visit 12) of this trial.

after 26 weeks .  Throughout this CTP, the term “baseline” for HbA 1crefers to the last 
observation prior to the first intake of randomised trial medication.
5.1.2 Secondary e ndpoint s
The key  secondary  endpoints to assess efficac y are as shown below.  Throughout this CTP, 
the term “baseline” re fers to the 4 week period prior to randomisation for the rate of 
symptomatic hypogly caemic AEs with confirmed plasma glucose < 54 mg/dL (< 3.0 
mmol/L) and/or severe hypogl ycaemic AEs and the 2week placebo run -in period for the 
mean dail y insulin requirement .

been developed (NGSP = [0.09148*I FCC] + 2.152).  This relationship is continuously  
monitored and an y changes are investigated.  The NGSP certification process and test results 
for NGSP -certifi ed methods do not change as a result of the IFCC standardisation of HbA 1c, 
and will continue to be directly traceable to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial 
(DCCT) reference and now also the IFCC reference.
Further details about HbA 1csample handling, shipment, and assay  procedures can be found in 
the laboratory  manual in the I SF.
Blood samples for the determination of FPG at the central laboratory  will be taken after an 
overnight fast (no food or drinks except for water for at least 10 hours).  The samples should

use during these periods of the study .  Prior to its first use, instructions on the proper use of 
the e -diary  will be provided by  the site staff.  Refresher training should be provided at 
subsequent timepoints as deemed appropriate b y the Investigator or designated site -
personnel.
Daily  entries into the e -diary  will include at least: 
glucose values from SBGM (see Section 5.3.2.1)
any hypoglycaemic events that have occurred
ofor criteria for h ypogl ycaemic events, see Section 5.3.5.2
insulin requirement
Any ketone measurements performed should also be entered into the e -diary  if and when any  
data becomes available (see Section 5.3.2.2).
During the T1DM therapy  optimisation period, and daily  for 5 days following clinic Visit 6, 
data from the e -diary  should be reviewed remotel y by designated site personnel, pay ing 
particular attention to adjustments in the insulin regimen, glucose values, and if available, 
ketone measurements.  In addition, the patient should be contacted b y telephone (e.g. weekl y 
during the T1DM therapy optimisation period) if e- diary  data, including glucose data, is not 
available and/or if the data suggest closer monitoring of the patient is required.  Additional 
clinic visits can also be arranged if necessary  (for further details see Section 6.2.2); 
assessments at such visits would be defined according to Investigator judgement.
Throughout the trial, the Investigator and/or designated site personnel shou ld review the 
patient’s glucose and e -diary  results to determine if treatment adjustments need to be 
implemented.  As a minimum, this review must take place at the timepoints indicated in the 
Flow Chart .
The e -diary  data wi ll be transferred to a vendor server for data collection and transfer to the 
Sponsor .

SBP and DBP as well as pulse rate (electronically  or by  palpation, count for 1 minute) will be 
measured at the timepoints indicated in the Flow Chart with a calibrated electronic 
sphy gmomanometer.  The BP measurement should be performed three times at each 
timepoint and the mean value of the measurements will be analysed.
Initia lly, BP should be taken 3 times in both arms.  The arm with the higher average pressure 
(systolic or – if equal –diastolic) should be used for subsequent measurements; if 
measurements for both arms are equal, the non -dominant arm should be chosen.
BP mea surements should alway s be performed on the same arm and, if possible, by the same 
person and using the same device.  The same method must be used throughout the trial for a 
given patient i.e. if a patient receives the first BP measurement for example with an electronic 
device, the same method and device should be used throughout the study  for this patient.
After patients have rested quietly , in the seated position for at least 5 minutes, 3 BP 
measurements will be taken approximately  2 minutes apart.  The seated pulse rate should be 
from the second BP reading.
BP measurements should be recorded to the nearest 1 mmHg.
BP should alway s be measured before an y blood samples are taken.

ASSESSMENT OF S AFETY 5.3
5.3.1 Physical e xamination
Physical examinations will be performed b y the Investigator or designated site- personnel at 
the timepoints indicated in the Flow Chart .  Documentation of, and findings from the phy sical 
examination, must be part of the source documents available at the site.
5.3.2 Home monitoring
Self-blood glucose monitoring 5.3.2.1
From the beginning of the T1DM therap y optimisation period (Visit 2) until the end of the 
Follow -up period (Visit 12), all patients will be provided with SBGM equi pment (i.e. a 
glucose monitoring device/meter) and supplies for use at home during the study  for self -
measurement of blood glucose.  Instructions on the proper use of the SBGM equipment will 
be provided b y the site staff.  The patient will be asked to ente r data from the glucose meter 
tothe e -diary  on a dail y basis.
Routinely , SBGM testing should be performed 4 times a day  as a minimum (e.g. at least 
before breakfast, lunch, dinner and at bedtime); furthermore, for 5 day s from the day  of 
randomisation (i. e. Day s 1-5), SBGM testing frequency  should be increased to 8 -10 times a

between the patient going to bed and getting up).  On one of these 5 day s, the day time 
timepoint s of the SBGM testing should mirror the timepoints for a 9-point plasma glucose 
profile (for further details see Section 5.2.5).  Additional tests should be done as 
recommended b y the Investigator (e.g. up to 7 days post randomis ation) or at an y time the 
patient is sy mptomatic, i.e. experiences signs/s ymptoms of hy per-or hypogly caemia.  In 
patients prone to nocturnal hy poglycaemic events, a bedtime snack consisting of long -acting 
carboh ydrates should be considered.  Alternatively , minimum glucose levels of e.g.  > 110 -
130 mg/dL (> 6.1 -7.2 mmol/L) should be targeted at bedtime to avoid nocturnal 
hypoglycaemia.  The Sponsor will also provide guidance on this topic via documentation in 
the ISF.
If, after an overnight fast, anSBGM test result reveals blood glucose of > 200 – 240 mg/dL 
(> 11.1 – 13.3 mmol/L ) or ≤ 70 mg/dL ( ≤3.9 mmol/L ), the patient should be asked to contact 
the site for advice.   The Investigator should then instruct the patient on appropriate measures 
in orde r to adequatel y control their hypergl ycaemia or h ypogl ycaemia.  All insulin treatment 
decisions should be based on blood glucose values measured using SBGM or based on 
laboratory  values obtained through the central laboratory  (or, if applicable, the local 
laboratory ).
A comparable SBGM s ystem will be supplied to all patients and must be used by them 
throughout the stud y.  In accordance with Section 3.3.2, I nvestigator’s should carefully  select 
patients for the stud y in terms of t heir abilit y to comply  with the SBGM requirements.  
Patients not adhering to the SBGM instructions given by  the Investigator should be retrained 
at the earliest possible opportunity .
Ketone measurement 5.3.2.2
Patients will be equipped with an electronic device to determine their ketone concentration 
(i.e. a blood glucose monitoring device/meter that is also capable of measuring blood 
ketones).
Patients should be reminded to test their ketones in case of any  symptoms of DKA, e.g. 
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, etc., irrespective of the glucose value.  Patients must be 
reminded about the signs and sy mptoms of DKA, on the interpretation of ketone values 
measured via the meter, and on appropriate action to take in the event of increased ketone 
levels (see below) .  In the same way  as during routine clinical care, patients should also be 
reminded to test for ketones in case of repeatedl y elevated blood glucose levels (e.g. > 200 -
240mg/dL [> 11.1 - 13.3 mmol/L ]) which cannot be explained.  Regular (e.g. 2-3 times a 
week) measurements before breakfast are recommended throughout the trial as from Visit 2. 
More frequent (e.g. once daily ) measurements before breakfast are recommended during the 
run-in period and during the first 4 weeks of the treatment period and might also be agreed 
upon with the patient afterwards if deemed necessary  by the Investigator.
In the event of increased ketones, patients should either follow the rules given by  their 
Investigator (e.g. increased fluid intake and/or insulin bolus ; food intake and insulin bolus in 
case of near -
normal blood glucose ) or contact their trial site.  In case of deteriorating ketosis,

range considered to be normal for the patient .  Patients should be instructed to immediately  
refer themselves to hospital and/or the Investigator, or to contact an emergency  physician in 
case of a blood ketone concentration > 1.5 mmol/L (as indicated in the meter manual).  In 
case of a suspected DKA the Investigator should ensure that appropriate tests are performed 
at the earliest opportunity according to local guidelines, such as a blood gas test (pH, 
bicarbonate) .  The results will be collected on the relevant page of the eCRF.
Investigators should also differentiate deteriorating ketosis/DKA from an y mild to moderate 
increase of ketones which may  be seen due to the mechanism of action of empagliflozin, 
especiall y in the fasted state (e.g. in the morning).  For further details, see also Sections 
1.2.3.2 and 2.3.
In accordance with Section 3.3.2 , Investigator’s should carefully  select patients for the study  
in terms of their ability  to comply  with ketone measurement requirements.  Patients not 
adhering to the instructions given b y the Investigator should be retrained at the earliest 
possible opportunity .
5.3.3 Safety laboratory parameters
At the following visits, laboratory  samples will be collected from the patient after a full 
overnight fast (i.e. nothing to eat or drink except water for at least 10 hours): Visits 2, 6, 9, 11
EOT, eEOT (if applicable), and 1 2.  At all other visits, the pa tient does not have to be in a 
fasted state when laboratory samples are taken.
When applicable, laboratory  samples, as described in the Flow Chart , should be collected 
before trial medication is taken.
All parameters that will be determined during the trial conduct are listed in Table 5.3.3: 1 and 
Table 5.3.3: 2 .  The analy sis will be performed by a central laboratory .  The respective 
reference ranges and details abo ut sample handling and shipment will be provided in the 
laboratory  manual in the ISF.
UACR in spot urine will be calculated at the central laboratory .
The central laboratory  will derive the eGFR from (and report it together with) serum 
creatinine values based on the CKD -EPI formula which is considered more accurate in the 
normal range than the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula.  The CKD -
EPI formula will be defined in central laboratory  documentation due to regional/racial 
variations in the formula that is applied.
The eGFR (cy statin C, serum) will also be derived, at the visits where c ystatin C levels are 
measured.

5.3.5 Other safety parameters
Assessment of h ypoglycaemia rate 5.3.5.1
Hypoglycaemia rates will be assessed based on AE data, which in turn rely on the criteria for 
hypoglycaemic events (see Section 5.3.5.2 below).  Glucose values used within the criteria 
for h ypoglycaemic events will originate in the SBGM device and from central laboratory 
measurements.  All glucose values originating in the SGBM device will subse quently  be 
entered into the e -diary  (for further details please see Sections 5.2.3 and 5.3.2.1 ).
Criteria for h ypogl ycaemic events 5.3.5.2
Every  episode of blood/plasma glucose ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤3.9 mmol/L) should be documented 
with the respective time and date of occurrence.  This includes hy poglycaemia with glucose 
values < 54 mg/dL (< 3.0 mmol/L) and all s ymptomatic and all severe h ypogl ycaemic events.
For the anal ysis, all hy poglycaemias wil l be classified according to the following criteria:
Asymptomatic hy poglycaemia: event not accompanied b y typi cal symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia but with a measured glucose concentration ≤ 70 mg/dL ( ≤ 3.9 mmol/L)
Documented s ymptomatic hy poglycaemia with gluco se concentration ≥ 54 mg/dL and

5.3.6 Assessment of adverse events
Definitions of AE s 5.3.6.1
Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily  have 
to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
AnAE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE which:
results in death
is life -threatening
requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation
results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity
is a conge nital anomal y/birth defect
or
is to be deemed serious for an y other reason if it is an important medical event when 
based upon appropriate medical judgement which may  jeopardise the patient and may  
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
above definitions.
Life-threatening in this context refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might have caused death 
if more severe.

01-MCS -40-106-RD-03(11.0)/Saved on:24Jul2014AEs considered “Always Serious”
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, 
BI has set up a list of AEs, which by  their nature, can alway s be considered to be “serious” 
even though they  may  not have met the criteria of an SAE as given above.
The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the Remote Data Capture ( RDC )
system .  These events should alway s be reported as SAEs as described in Section 5.3.6.1
Adverse events of Special Interest (AESIs)
The term AESI relates to any  specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being 
of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring and safet y assessment within this trial, 
e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class.  
AESI s need to be reported to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same 
timeframe that applies to SAE, see Section 5.3.7.
Patients with AESI s need to be followed up appropriately , regardless of the origin of the 
laboratory  data (e.g. central, local etc.). The Investigator should consider which, if any , 
concomitant therapies should not be taken during evaluation.  Discontinued treatments can be 
reintroduce d per Investigator discretion.
The following are considered as AESIs:
Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury  is defined by  the following alterations of hepatic laboratory  parameters after 
randomisation (Visit 6): 
an elevation of AST and/or ALT ≥3 fold ULN combined with an elevation of total 
bilirubin ≥2 fold ULN measured in the same blood sample
an isolat ed elevation of AL T and/or AST ≥ 5 fold ULN
These laboratory  findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided via the 
RDC -system.
In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury  (icterus, unexpla ined encephalopathy , unex -
plained coagulopath y, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without laboratory  results 
(ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the Investigator should make sure these parameters are 
analysed, if necessary  in an unscheduled blo od test.  Should the results meet the criteria of 
hepatic injury  alert, the procedures described in the “DILI checklist” should be followed .

Decreased renal function is defined by  a creatinine value showing a ≥ 2fold increase from 
baseline and is above the ULN.
For the AESI “decreased renal function” the Investigator shall collect an unscheduled 
laboratory  sample for creatinine as soon as possible and initiate follow -up laboratory  tests of 
creatinine according to medical judg ement.
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
DKA is defined b y the diagnostic criteria in Table 5. 3.6.1: 1 below, and as defined b y the 
American Diabetes Association (ADA) [ R14-5435 ].
Investigators should note that not all criteria in the table below need to apply  for the diagnosis 
of DKA, and clinical judgement should also be taken into consideration. Due to its 
mechanism of action, empagliflozin may  potentially  modify  the clinical presentation of DKA 
which may  occur at lower plasma glucose levels than stated in Table 5.3.6.1: 1 below (see 
Section s 1.2.3.2 and 2.3for further details).

01-MCS -40-106-RD-03(11.0)/Saved on:24Jul2014Severe h ypogl ycaemic episodes 
Severe h ypogl ycaemic episodes are events requiring the assistance of another person to 
activel y administer carbohydrate, glucagon or other corrective actions.  Plasma glucose 
concentrations may  not be available during an event, but neurological recovery  following the 
return of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was 
induced b y a low plasma glucose concentration.
This includes fatal h ypogly caemic events.
Events involving lower limb amputation
This definition includes amputation (i.e. resection of a limb through a bone), disarticulation 
(i.e. resection of a limb through a joint) and auto -amputations (i.e. spontaneous separation of 
non-viable portion of the lower limb).
Not included in this definition are debridement (removal of callus or dead tissue), procedures 
on a stump (like stump revision, drainage of an abscess, wound revision etc.) and other 
procedures (e.g., nail resection or removal) without a concom itant resection of a limb 
(amputation or disarticulation).
Each lower limb amputation, disarticulation, or auto -amputation should be reported 
separately . The SAE report should include the date of the procedure, the level of amputation 
or disarticulation, the medical condition(s) leading to the procedure and if the patient had 
some of the known risk factor(s) for lower limb amputation.
Intensity of AEs
The intensity  of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or symptom(s) that is/are easily  tolerated
Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability  to work or to perform usual activities
Causal relationship of AEs
Medical judgement should be used t o determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, 
confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history .
Yes: There i s a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE.
No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE.

5.3.7 Adverse event collection and reporting
AE collection
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate eCRF and/or other 
designated data collection repository  by the Investigator (see also Figure 5.3.7: 1 below) :
From signing the informed consent onwards through the Residual Effect period (REP), 
until trial completion, all AEs (serious and non -serious), and AESIs
If in an individual patient only  vital status information is collected from a certain time 
point on, no further AEs or AESI s will be reported for this patient
Figure 5.3.7: 1 Trial periods for collection of AEs
The REP is defined as 7 day s after the last trial medication application, except for 
hypoglycaemia, where the REP is 1 day .  All AEs which occurred through the treatment 
period and throughout the REP will be considered as on treatment (please see Section 7.3.4). 
Events which occurred after the REP will be considered as post -treatment events.
After the last per protocol contact the Investigator does not need to acti vely monitor patients 
for AEs.  However, if the I nvestigator becomes aware of SAEs or AESIs that occurred after 
the last per protocol contact, the SAEs and AESIs should be reported b y the I nvestigator to 
the Sponsor if considered relevant b y the Investigat or.
AE reporting to Sponsor and timelines
The Investigator must report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form via fax immediately  (within 24 hours ) to the 
Sponsor’s unique entry  point (country  specific contact details will be provided in the I SF).

the Investigator could inform t he Sponsor upfront via telephone.  This does not replace the 
requirement to complete and fax the BI SAE form.
With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE form has to be 
provided.  For follow -up information the same rules and t imeline appl y as for initial 
information.
Information required
For each AE, the Investigator should provide the information requested on the appropriate 
eCRF pages and/or other designated data collection repository  and the BI SAE form, e.g. 
onset, end da te, intensit y, treatment required, outcome, seriousness, and action taken with the 
investigational drug(s).  The Investigator should determine the causal relationship to the trial 
medication and the trial procedures outlined under Section 6.2.
The following should also be recorded as an (S)AE in the eCRF and/or other designated data 
collection repository  and SAE form (if applicable):
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laboratory  test results, if they  are 
judged clinically  relevant by  the Investigator
If such abnormalities already  pre-exist prior to trial inclusion they  will be considered as 
baseline conditions.
All (S)AEs, including those persisting after trial completion must be followed up until they  
have resolved, have been sufficiently  characterised, or no further information can be obtained.
Screening failures
SAEs occurring in patients after having discontinued in the trial due to screening failures, i.e. 
after the screening period and who did not receive any  trial medication, are to be reported if 
the Investigator considered the SAE related to the screening pr ocedure.  SAEs which 
occurred during the screening period are to be reported according to standard procedures.
Pregnancy
In the rare case that a female patient participating in this clinical trial becomes pregnant after 
having taken trial medication, the Investigator must report immediately  (within 24 hours) the 
drug exposure during pregnancy  (DEDP) to the Sponsor’s unique entry  point (country -
specific contact details will be provided in the I SF).  The Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for 
Clinical Trials (Part A ) should be used.

(Part B).
As pregnancy  itself is not to be reported as an AE , in the absence of an accompany ing SAE, 
only the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials and not the SAE form is to be 
completed.  If there is an SAE associated with the pregnancy  then the SAE has to be report ed

APPROPRIATENESS OF M EASUREMENTS 5.7
All measurements performed during this trial are considered standard measurements in the 
clinical development of a non -insulin product such as empagliflozin, and/or standard as pa rt 
of routine care for T1DM [ R08-2669, R14 -0344].  All defined measurements will be 
performed in order to monitor safet y and tolerability aspects and to determine efficacy and 
PK in an appropriate w ay.
A surrogate endpoint (i.e. the laboratory  parameter HbA 1c) is used as the primary  efficacy  
endpoint, since for the purposes of drug approval and label ing, which will support an 
indication of gl ycaemic control, regulatory  authorities state that this endpoint, albeit 
surrogate, is the primary  endpoint of choice [ R08-2669].

VISIT SCHEDULE 6.1
All trial visits should tak e place in the morning (e.g. between 7am and 11am).   All patients 
must adhere to the visit schedule as specified in the Flow Chart .  
 
If any visit has to be re -scheduled, subsequent visits should follow the original visit schedule.  
The trial medication kits will c ontain sufficient medication to allow for the protocol -
permitted visit windows.
If a patient mistakenl y takes trial medication on the morning of a visit before attending the 
clinic (excluding visits prior to randomisation) or comes in non -fasted where a f asting 
condition is required, the visit should be re -scheduled to the next day  reminding the patient 
about the expected conditions.  
 
DETAILS OF TRIAL PRO CEDURES AT SELECTED VISITS 6.2
At each visit, assessments should be performed as indicated in the Flow Chart and as detailed 
in the respective pro tocol sections.
6.2.1 Screening, T1DM therapy optimisation and placebo run- in periods
Screening visit (Visit 1) 6.2.1.1
The screening visit does not need to be done with the patient in a fasted state (see Section
5.3.3)
No trial procedures sho uld be done unless the patient has consented to taking part in the 
trial.  Once they  have consented, the patient is considered to be enrolled in the trial and to 
have started screening.  The patient should be recorded on the enrolment log and be 
registered in the I RT s ystem as a screened patient
BP should alway s be measured before an y blood samples are taken .  For details regarding 
the correct method for measuring BP, see Section 5.2.4
Patients who are not eligible to proceed to Visit 2 should be registered as a screen failure 
in the I RT s ystem and the eCRF and no further follow -up is required
T1DM therap y optimisation period (Visits 2, 3 and 4 T) 6.2.1.2
Visit 2 should be done with the patient in a fasted state (i.e. no food or drink exce pt water 
for 10 hours) (see Section 5.3.3)

Visit 3T, if performe d as a telephone visit, does not require attendance at the clinic.  If 
performed as a clinic visit, Visit 3 does not need to be done with the patient in a fasted 
state (see Section 5.3.3 )
Visit 4 Tis a telephone visit and does no t require attendance at the clinic
Each visit should only  be performed once it has been confirmed that the patient is eligible 
to progress to the next visit; ineligible patients should be registered in the IRT s ystem and 
the eCRF as a screen failure and no further follow -up is required
BP should alway s be measured before an y blood samples are taken (relevant for Visit 2 
only).  For deta ils regarding the correct method for measuring BP, see Section 5.2.4
At the end of each visit, patients should be reminded about the importance of entering 
data into their e -diary  on a daily  basis, including data from the glucose/ketone meter, so 
that optimisation of the T1DM therap y can be monitored remotel y by designated site -
personnel, and an asse ssment made of the need for weekl y telephone discussions and/or 
additional visits  
Placebo run- in period (Visit 5) 6.2.1.3
Visit 5 does not need to be done with the patient in a fasted state (see Section 5. 3.3)
Visit 5 should only  be performed once it has been confirmed that the patient is eligible to 
progress to this visit, based on an assessment of results from Visits 2 to 4 T
As for Visit 1, BP should always be measured before an y blood samples are taken.  For 
details regarding the c orrect method for measuring BP, see Section 5.2.4
Following completion of the Visit 5 procedures, eligible patients will be dispensed a 
placebo run -in kit for the 2 week run -in period which will be assigned via the I RT s ystem.  
Ineligible patients should be registered in the IRT sy stem and the eCRF as a screen failure 
and no further follow -up is required

01-MCS -40-106-RD-03(11.0)/Saved on:24Jul2014Throughout the treatment period, BP should always be measured before an y blood samples 
are taken.  For details regarding the correct method for measuring BP, see Section 5.2.4.
Laboratory  samples should also be taken prior to the intake of trial medication at clinic visits 
throughout the treatment period.
All patients, including those who discontinue treatment early, must be followed up until the 
end of the stud y.  Patients must continue to be followed up according to the visit s chedule 
(unless they  withdraw consent for further follow -up) in order to collect data at the end of the 
planned observation period.  For further details see Section 6.2.3.
Randomisation visit (Visit 6) 6.2.2.1
Visit 6 should be done with the patient in a fasted state (i.e. no food or drink except water 
for 10 hours), and only  once it has been confirmed that the patient is eligible to progress 
to randomisation.  This includes a check of the data from the patient e- diary , and 
 
Eligible patients will be randomised on Day 1 by using the IRT s ystem;all visit 
assessments should have been completed prior to this, and before the first intake of study  
medication
At Visit 6 (Day  1) the patient should also be reminded to contact the site without delay  if 
he/she has an y questions or concerns with respect to insulin adjustments.  The patient 
should also be reminded to increase the frequency of SBGM testing for 5 day s from the 
day of randomisation (i.e. on Day s 1-5),  
   
Where considered necessary , the patient should be called dail y for 5 days following 
Day 1 to discuss further adjustment of their insulin therap y; additional clinic visits should 
be scheduled if closer monitoring of the patient is warranted
Interim visits (Visits 7 -10) 6.2.2.2
Visit 9 should be done with the patient in a fasted state (i.e. no food or drink except water 
for 10 hours); Visits 7, 8 and10do not require fasting
  
Prior to each clinic visit, patients should be reminded to attend without having taken their 
trial medication in the morning, and to bring all used/unused medication with them to the 
visit 
  
using their SBGM device, 
starting directly before a dose of study  medication is administered, and to continue this 
until directly  before administering stud y medication on the following day

6.2.3 End of treatment and follow -up period
End of treatment –completers (Visit 1 1EOT) 6.2.3.1
Patients who succe ssfully  complete the 26week treatment period should have the 
assessments for Visit 1 1EOT performed, as indicated in the Flow Chart .  Patients who 
complete the full 26week treatment period should be registered as completed in the I RT 
system.
Visit 1 1 EOT should be done with the patient in a fasted state (i.e. no food or drink except 
water for 10 hours), and patients should be reminded to attend without having taken their 
trial medication in the morning as they  will take the last dose at the site , and to bring all 
used/unused medication with them to the visit.  The patient should be reminded not to 
start an y new anti -diabetic therap y until after Visit 1 2
  
Patients should be reminded to continue with e- diary  entries, checks of glucose and 
ketones using the glucose and ketone monitoring device for another 3 weeks until Visit 12
End of tre atment -early discontinuations (eEOT) and withdrawals 6.2.3.2
For the anal ysis of this trial it is absolutely  crucial that all planned assessments are done as 
planned, even if patients discontinue trial treatment .Patients who discontinue treatment 
prematurel y and who do not withdraw their informed consent must therefore be followed up 
for the intended regular treatment period.  All assessments related to the primary  and 
secondary  endpoints must be performed as if the patient would have remained on treatment.
Patients who discontinue study  medication earl y should have the assessments for eEOT 
(Earl y Discontinuations Only) performed, as indicated in the Flow Chart .  For such patients, 
the eEOT Visit should be done as soon as possibl e after the decision to discontinue has been 
made.  If the eEOT Visit occurs within the time window of a scheduled visit and the patient 
continues to be followed up, the eEOT Visit will replace that scheduled visit.  For example:
if a patient discontinues study  medication 16 weeks after randomisation (i.e. between 
Visits 9 and 10), the eEOT Visit could be scheduled one week later, and it would occur 
within the time window of the next scheduled visit (i.e. Visit 10 at Week 18 +/ -7 day s).  
When returning to the visit schedule, after completing the 3 week Follow -up Visit (see 
Section 6.2.3.3 below), the patient would return for Visit 11 EOT at Week 26
If a patient intends to immediately  discontinue (withdr aw) from the stud y, an eEOT Visit 
should be performed as soon as possible after the decis ion to withdraw has been made.

Patients who successfully  complete the 26week treatment period should have the 
assessments for Visit 1 2 performed, as indicated in the Flow Chart . For these patients: 
Visit 1 2should be done with the patient in a fasted state (i.e. no food or drink except 
water for 10 hours)

Follow -up visit (Visit 1 2) –early discontinuations (eEOT) and withdrawals 6.2.3.4
For patients who discontinue treatment prematurely prior to completion of 26weeks the 
following should be performed whenever possible once an eEOT Visit has been completed 
(see Section 6.2.3.2):
3 weeks after the date of the eEOT Visit , patients should complete Visit 12.  Visit 1 2
should be done with the patient in a fasted state (i.e. no f ood or drink except water for 10 
hours), and a ll assessments indicated in the Flow Chart for Visit 12 should be performed 
Thereafter, patients should be followed up according to the visit schedule (e.g. a patient 
who discontinued study medication a week after Visit 8 ( Week 4) –i.e. at Week 5 -
would next be followed up for Visit 9 ( Week 12) after having completed an eEOT visit as 
soon as possible after Week 5, and a Visit 12at Week 8.
The Investigator may
 negotiate a revised visit schedule should the patient be unwilling or 
unable to adhere to the regular schedule according to the Flow Chart .  These follow -up 
visits may  occur b y telephone or in the clinic but Visit 11 EOT (Week 26) must be 
performed as a clinic visit in order to complete all scheduled assessments
When being followed up according to the visit schedule, only assessments relating to the 
primary  and secondary endpoints and general safety  have to be completed (i.e. weight, 
vital signs, phy sical examination, ECG, safety  laboratory , pregnancy  test, HbA 1c, e-diary

from the patient, together with all other study -related devices and equipment, once the 
visit is complete d
For patients who discontinue treatment prematurely and do not wish to follow the visit 
schedule, at le ast a contact should be planned, at the timepoint of the primary  endpoint at 26
weeks to collect data about the vital status as a minimum.
If study  treatment is stopped prior to completion of 26weeks and the patient intends to 
immediately  discontinue (wi thdraw) from the study , an eEOT Visit should be performed as 
soon as possible after the decision to withdraw has been made.  The patient should return for

SAMPLE SIZE
STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL 7.1
This is a randomised, double blind, multi -centre, placebo- controlled, parallel group, 26week 
study  to assess the efficacy , safet y, tolerability , and PK of once dail y oral doses of 
empagliflozin 2.5 mg, 10 mg and 25 mg compared to placebo in patients with T1DM as 
adjunctive to insulin therapy .
The superiorit y of the 3 doses of empagliflozin will be tested against placebo. A Bonferroni 
adjustment will first correct for the parallel testing of the 2 higher doses (empagliflozin 25 
mg and 10 mg ) inorder to maintain a ty pe I error rate of 0.05.  Each of these 2 doses will 
therefore be tested at the level of α=0.025 (two -sided).
Following the efficacy  analy sis(on-treatment data only )of the primary  endpoint, change 
from baseline in HbA 1cafter 26 weeks, for the 2 higher doses, an effectiveness anal ysis (on-
and off -treatment data) will be performed in a hierarchical manner.  If the null hy pothesis is 
rejected for both the efficacy  and effectiveness analy sis the error rate will be unequall y split 
and transferred between the testing of the lowest dose empagliflozin 2.5 mg (with an 
allocated alpha weight of 1/5) and the testing of k ey secondary  endpoints (with an allocated 
alpha weight of 4/5) in a gatekeeping strategy .  If the null -hypothesis of “equal HbA 1cchange 
after 26 weeks between placebo and empagliflozin 2.5 mg” can be rejected using on-
treatment data onl y, alpha of this te st will be equally  split and added to the alpha level for the 
test of the key  secondary  endpoints of the two higher doses.
Superiority  of empagliflozin 10 mg versus placebo in key  secondary  endpoints will be 
sequentially  tested with an unequal alpha split .  The same approach will be followed to test 
superiority  of empagliflozin 25 mg versus placebo on these endpoints.
See Section 7.2 for further details on the endpoint testing strategy .
With regard to efficacy  and safet y endpoints, the term “baseline” refers to the last observed 
measurement prior to administration of any  randomised study  medication, the 4 week period
prior to randomisation for the rate of h ypoglycaemia and the run-in period from Visit 5 to 
Visit 6 for the mean daily  insulin requirement.
Patients who prematurel y discontinue trial medication will continue to attend all visits and be 
followed up until the end of the trial when possible.
The randomisation will be stratified b y the Visit 5 eGFR value (< 60 mL/ min/1.73 m2versus 
≥60 mL /min/1.73 m2), the Visit 5 HbA 1cvalue (< 8.5% versus ≥ 8.5%), by  the patients’ pre -
existing insulin therapy  (MDI  versus CSII) , and by  the patient’s participation in the CGM 
substudy  (CGM participation versus non -CGM participation) .  If necessary, and depending 
upon global distribution, entry of patients into a particular HbA 1cstratum may  be capped.

The following testing procedure will be used to evaluate the superiority  for the primary
endpoint for empagliflozin 25 and 10 mg doses against placebo at the level of α=0.025 .  The 
overall probabilit y of t ype I error is therefore maintained at α=0.05 (two -sided).
The superiorit y of treatment with empagliflozin to placebo will be tested for H bA1cchange 
from baseline at Week 26, via the pairwise comparison of the two higher empagliflozin dose s
against placebo, at α=0.025 level.  Both doses will be tested in parallel on the Full Anal ysis 
Set (FAS) for the efficacy  analy sis and on the modified I ntention -to-Treat (mI TT) set for the 
effectiveness anal ysis; see Section 7.3 for the analy sis set definitions.  Both anal yses will test 
the same null hy pothesis:
H0,0,1: Mean change from baseline in HbA 1c(%) after 26 weeks in the empagliflozin 10 mg 
group = Mean change from baseline in HbA 1c(%) after 26 weeks in the placebo group
H0,0,2: Mean change from baseline in HbA 1c(%) after 26 weeks in the empagliflozin 25 mg 
group = Mean change from baseline in HbA 1c(%) after 26 weeks in the placebo group
Following testing of the null hy potheses H 0,0,1 and H 0,0,2 for both efficacy  and effectiveness 
for HbA 1c,within each dose group (empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg) the remaining alpha will be 
unequally  split for te sting the superiority  of empagliflozin 2.5 mg to placebo on the primary  
endpoint and for testing the superiorit y of the key  secondary  endpoints for the higher doses as 
detailed below.
One-fifth of the remaining alpha will be used for testing the superiori ty of 
empagliflozin 2.5 mg to placebo on the primary  endpoint .  The test will be done two -
sided.  T he null hy pothesis is as follows: 
H0,0,3: Mean change from baseline in HbA 1c(%) after 26 weeks in the empagliflozin 2.5 mg 
group= Mean change from baseline in HbA 1c(%) after 26 weeks in the placebo group
Depending on the success of the testing of H0,0,1 andH0,0,2, H0,0,3 willbe tested at the following 
alpha level α 0,3:
If eitherH0,0,1 or H 0,0,2 is rejected at 0.025 level, then 
oα0,3 = 1/5×0.025=0.005.
If H 0,0,1 andH0,0,2 are both rejected at 0.025 level, then
oα0,3 = 1/5×0.025+ 1/5×0.025= 0.01.
Four -fifth of the remaining alpha will be transferred for testing the superiority  of the 
key secondary  endpoints for empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg.  
Additionally , if H 0,0,3 is 
rejected,   the alpha α 0,3of the testing of H 0,0,3 will be equall y split and added to the 
alpha level for testing the superiority  of the key  secondary  endpoints.  For further 
details, see Step 2 in Table 7.2: 1 .  The null hy potheses for the key  seco ndary  
endpoints are as follows:

PLANNED ANALYSES 7.3
To account for the testing of 2doses of empagliflozin 25 and 10 mg , a Bonferroni adjustment 
will be applied to the ty pe I error rate and tests for the primary  endpoint (efficacy  and 
effectiveness sequentially) will be conducted at the level of α=0.025 (two -sided).  A 
gatekeeping strategy  will then be employ ed for the test of the primary  endpoint for 
empagliflozin 2.5 mg against placebo .  Gatekeeping and sequential testing strategy  will 
follow for tests of the key secondary  endpoints for empagliflozin 25 and 10 mg to maintain 
the ty pe I error rate at the level of α=0.025 ( two-sided) within each dose ( see Section 7.2 for 
details).
Safety  anal yses will be performed on the treated set (TS).  The TS is defined as all patients 
treated with at least one dose of study  medication.
The primary  efficacy  analy sis for all empagliflozin doses will be performed on the FAS.  The 
FAS is defined as all randomised patients who are treated with at least one dose of study  
medication, have a baseline HbA 1cand at least one on -treatment HbA 1cmeasurement.
  The 
effect iveness anal ysis of the primary  endpoint for empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg will be 
performed on the mITT set.  The mITT set is defined as all randomised patients who have a 
baseline HbA 1cand at least one post randomisation HbA 1cmeasurement .
A per protoc ol set (PPS) of patients following the trial protocol in essential criteria will be 
created for sensitivity  analy ses.  Patients included in the FAS who have important protocol 
violations (I PVs) that can be expected to have a distorting influence on the ass essment of the

will be provided in the Trial Statistical Analy sis Plan (TSAP).
Further sensitivity  anal yses will be based on the randomised set (RS).  The RS includes all 
randomised patients regardless of t reatment with study  medication.
All analy ses will be conducted in SAS®version 9.2 or later.
7.3.1 Primary endpoint analyses
Primary  anal ysis of the primary  endpoint 7.3.1.1
The primary  endpoint in this trial is the change from baseline in HbA 1c(%) after 26 weeks.
The primary  efficacy  analy sis will be performed on the FAS; patients will be assigned to the 
treatment they  were randomised to and anal ysed according to the stratum to which they  
belong (regardless of an y mis -assignm ent based on identification of the wrong stratum).  
Only  on-treatment HbA 1cvalues will be in cluded in the primary  analy sisfor efficacy .
Mean changes from baseline in HbA 1cafter 26 weeks will be anal ysed using a restricted 
maximum likelihood -based repeated measures approach (MMRM analy sis).  Anal yses will 
include the fixed categorical effects of treatment, pre- existing insulin therapy , week and 
treatment b y week interaction , as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline HbA 1c, 
baseline eGFR and baseline HbA 1cby week interaction.  An unstructured (co)variance 
structure will be used to model the within patient measurements.
If this anal ysis fails to converge, the following covariance structures will be tested: 
compound sy mmetry , variance components and Toeplitz.  The (co)variance structure 
converging to the best fit, as determined b y Akaike’s information criterion, will be used as 
the primary  analy sis.
The Kenward- Roger approximation will be used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom.  
Significance tests will be based on least -squares means using a two -sided α = 0.025 (two-
sided 97.5% confidence intervals).  The residuals are assumed to have a multivariate nor mal 
distribution with zero means and covariance matrix as specified above.  The primary  
treatment comparisons will be the contrast between treatments at Week 26.
The statistical model will be:
HbA 1cchange from baseline = overall mean + continuous basel ine HbA 1c+ pre -existing 
insulin therapy  + continuous baseline eGFR + treatment + 
week + baseline HbA 1cby week interaction + treatment by  
week interaction + random error
For empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg, following the anal ysis of the efficacy  estimand, an 
effectiveness anal ysis will be performed on the mITT set.  This will use the same model as 
described for the efficacy anal ysis, but include all available on -and off - treatment values.

Safety  will be assessed for the endpoints listed in Section 5.1.3.2. All treated patients will be 
included in the safet y evaluation (i.e. in the TS).  Safet y analyses will assign patients to the 
treatment group as randomised. Safety  anal yses will be mostly  descriptive in nature and will 
be based on BI standards.  I n addit ion, statistical analysis for selected endpoints (to be 
defined in the TSAP) may  be performed, if appropriate.  No hypothesis testing is planned.
The active empagliflozin treatment groups will be compared with the placebo group in a 
descriptive way .  Tabulations of frequencies/proportions will be used for the evaluation of 
categorical (qualitative) data, and tabulations of descriptive statistics will be used to 
summarise continuous (quantitative) data.
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Di ctionary  for Drug Regulatory  Affairs
(MedDRA) .  The anal ysis of AEs will be based on the concept of treatment emergent adverse 
events.  That means that all AEs occurring from first study  medication intake until 7 day s 
after last stud y medication intake will be assigned to the randomised treatment.  This includes 
AEs that start before first study  medication intake and deteriorate under treatment.  All AEs 
occurring before first study  medication intake will be assigned to ‘pre -treatment’ and all AEs 
occurring after last study  medication intake + 7 day s will be assigned to ‘post -treatment’.  
Additional listings based on actual treatment at onset of AE will be produced for patients who 
receive incorrect treatment at any  point during the trial.  Specific analy ses of hy poglycaemia 
will assign events onl y up to the end of the last study  medication intake + 1 day  to the 
randomised treatment, later h ypogl ycaemia events will be assigned to ‘post -treatment’.
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of AEs will be tabulated by s ystem organ class 
and preferred ter m after coding according to the current version of the MedDRA.
Independent of this rule, the relationship of an AE to the study  medication will be assessed b y 
the Investigator.
Laboratory  data will be analy sed both quantitatively  as well as qualitatively .  The latter will 
be done via comparison of laboratory data to their reference ranges.  Values outside the 
reference range as well as values defined as clinically  relevant will be highlighted in the 
listings.  Treatment groups will be compared descriptive ly with regard to distribution 
parameters as well as with regard to frequency  and percentage of patients with abnormal 
values or clini cally relevant abnormal values.
Vital signs, ph ysical examinations, or other safet y-relevant data observed at screening, 
baseline, during the course of the trial and at the end -of
-trial evaluation will be assessed with 
regard to possible changes compared to findings before start of treatment.

INTERIM ANALYSES 7.4
There is no interim analysis planned for this trial but the conduct of the trial will be 
monitored by  a DMC .For further details please refer to Section 3.1.1.1.
HANDLING OF MISSING DATA 7.5
For the primary  anal ysis of the primary  endpoint, if a patient misses a visit, the missing data 
will not be imputed and only  on-treatment data will be included.  The mixed effect model 
will handle missing data based on a likelihood method under the "missing at random 
assumption".  Every  randomised patient with at least baseline and one on- treatment 
measurement will be included in the anal ysis.  This approach will also be used for the 
confirmatory  anal ysis of the key secondary  endpoints investigating change from baseline in 
body  weight, TDID, SBP and DBP.
An anal ysis including off -treatment data and multiple imputation will be used as a sensitivity  
analysis for the primary  endpoint to handle missing data.  A deta iled description of multiple 
imputation will be included in the TSAP.  This approach will also be applied to the key  
secondary  endpoints of change from baseline in body  weight, TDID , SBP and DBP.
For the key  secondary  endpoint of incidence rate of symptom atic h ypogl ycaemic AEs with 
confirmed plasma glucose < 54 mg/dL  (<3.0 mmol/L ) and/or severe h ypoglycaemia , 
available on -treatment data will be anal ysed and no imputation performed.  A sensitivity  
analysis including post treatment events will also be perfor med.
Details regarding the imputation rule for further endpoints will be specified in the TSAP.  No 
imputation is planned for any  anal ysis of AEs, laboratory  data, and vital signs.
RANDOMISATION 7.6
The trial will be performed as a double -blind design w ith re spect to placebo and the 3 active 
dose groups of empagliflozin.  Patients will be randomised in blocks to the 4study  treatments 
in a 1:1:1:1 ratio at Visit 6.  The randomisation will be stratified by the baseline eGFR value 
as calculated b y the CKD -EPI formula (< 60 mL /min/1.73 m2versus ≥60 mL /min/1.73 m2), 
baseline HbA 1c (< 8.5% versus 
≥8.5%), the patients’ pre -existing insulin therap y (MDI

versus non- CGM participation) .If necessary , and depending upon global distribution, entry  
of patients into a particular HbA 1cstratum may  be capped.
The randomisation of patients to the treatment groups will be performed via I RT.  BI will 
arrange for the randomisation as well as packaging and labelling of study  medication.  The 
randomisation list will be generated using a validated sy stem, which involves a 
pseudorandom number generator and a supplied seed number so that the resulting allocation 
of medication numbers to treatment is both reproducible and non -predictable.  The block size 
will be documented in the CTR.  Access to the codes will be controlled and documented.
DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE 7.7
Based on previous experience with empagliflozin  it is 
estimated that the change in HbA 1cfrom baseline after 26 weeks of treatment is 0.3% in 
empagliflozin ( 2.5 mg, 10 mg and 25 mg) and 0% in placebo and that the standard deviat ion 
of this difference is 0.9%.
As this trial investigates primarily  the 2 higher dose levels of empagliflozin, 10 mg and 25 
mg, the alpha (Ty pe I error) is assumed to be 2.5%.  Assuming that the change from baseline 
in HbA 1cfollows a normal distribution (Student’s t -test) and that a tw o-sided test will be 
employ ed, with equal standard deviations, then a sample size of 225 patients per arm will 
show superiority  with a power of 90%.
Based on the results of these 2 tests (see Section 7.2 for further details) , when comparing 
empagliflozin 2.5 mg (n=225) to placebo (n=225) on the primary  endpoint, there is 82%
power , respectivel y 76%, to detect a significant difference (alpha=1%, respectively  
alpha= 0.5%) of 0.3% with a common standard deviation of 0.9%.
Software pac kage nQuery  version 7.0 was used to derive the sample size.
Given that there are 4treatment groups, a total sample size of 960patients (240 per group) 
will be randomised to allow for an estimated 6% of patients who do not qualify  for the FAS.

RECORDS
The trial will be carried out in compliance with the protocol, the ethical principles laid down 
in the Declaration of Helsinki, in accordance with the I CH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline 
for GCP ,relevant BI SOPs and relevant regulations.
Standard medical care (prophy lactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures) remains in the 
responsibility  of the treating phy sician of the patient.
The Investigator will inform the Sponsor immediately  of any  urgent safety measures taken to 
protect the trial subjects against an y immediate hazard, and also of an y serious breaches of 
the protocol or of ICH GCP.
The rights of the Investigator and of the Sponsor with regard to publication of the results of 
this trial are described in the I nvestigator contract .  As a rule, no trial results should be 
published prior to finalisation of the CTR.
As applicable locally , the certificate of insurance cover will be made available to the 
Investigator and the patients, and will be stored in the I SF.
TRIAL APPROVAL, PATI ENT INFORMATION, AND INFORMED 8.1
CONSENT
This trial will be initiated only  after all required legal documentation has been reviewed and 
approved b y the respective I RB /IEC and CA according to national and international 
regulations.  The same applies for the implementation of changes introduced by  amendments.
Prior to patient participation in the trial, written informed consent must be obtained from each 
patient (or the patient’s legally  accepted representative) according to ICH / GCP an d to the 
regulatory  and legal requirements of the participating country .  Each signature must be 
personall y dated b y each signatory  and the informed consent and any  additional patient-
information form retained by  the Investigator as part of the trial recor ds.  A signed copy  of

eCRFs for individual patients will be provided b y the Sponsor. See Section 4.1.5.2 for rules 
about emergency  code breaks.  For drug accountability , refer to Section 4.1.8 .
8.3.1 Source documents
Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the patient and substantiate the 
integrit y of the data collected.  Source documents are filed at the Investigator’s site.
Data reported on the eCRF must be consistent with the source data or the discrepancies must 
be explained.  The Investigator may need to request previous medical recor ds or transfer 
records, depending on the trial; current medical records must also be available.
For eCRFs, all data must be derived from source documents.
8.3.2 Direct access to source data and documents
The Investigator/institution will permit trial -related m onitoring, audits, I RB / IEC review and

Description of change Statistical methods:
“The subsequent test will be the confirmatory  testing 
of the primary  endpoint between empagliflozin 2.5 
mg and placebo and will follow a gatekeeping 
strategy .
For empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg the key  
secondary  endpoints will be tested in a confirmatory  
way, following the test of the primary  endpoint.  The 
key secondary  endpoints will be anal ysed using a 
gatekeeping approach, with unequal splitting of the 
alpha, and sequential testing. ”
Has been changed to:
“The primary analysis will be an efficacy 
analysis, including on -treatment data only.  
Following the efficacy analysis, an effectiveness 
analysis (on -and off -treatment data) of 
empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg versus placebo 
will be performed in a hierarchical manner.  If 
the null hypothesis is rejected for both the 
efficacy and effectiveness analysis then the 
primary endpoint (between empagliflozin 2.5 mg 
and placebo, on -treatment data only) and the key 
secondary endpoints will be tested in a

Section to be changed 2.3 BENEFIT -RISK ASSESSMENT
Description of change “As part of the preparation for entry  into the 
randomised treatment period, therap y for T1DM will 
be optimised (e.g. review of insulin dose and its 
adjustment for meals, ability  to carbohy drate count 
etc.) over a 6 week p eriod (T1DM therap y 
optimisation period) to ensure that, in the 
Investigator’s opinion, a patient is achieving the best 
standard of care in accordance with local guidelines 
before entering the randomised treatment period of 
the trial. This optimal therap y will then be 
continued, and at randomisation, I nvestigators are 
advised to reduce the patient’s total insulin dose by

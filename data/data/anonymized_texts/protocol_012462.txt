Clinical Trial Protocol: DDES001/ 18-110-0002  21 June 2018  
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 9 of 66 As an exploratory study, t he study is not powered to show statistical differences 
for any of the efficacy endpoints.  
With a sa mple size of 60 subjects in the Safety and Efficacy Assessment , the 
study will have 79% probability of detecting AEs occurring at a rate of 5% or 
more in either treatment arm.  
Multiplicity Consideration : 
There will be no adjustments for multiple endpoints or multiple treatment 
comparisons for this early phase, exploratory study.  
Safety Variables:  
Frequencies and percentages of subjects with treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), serious TEAEs, and TEAEs causing premature discontinuation will b e 
provided  by treatment group. An AE is treatment emergent if it occurs or worsens 
after the first dose of study treatment.  Separate summaries  will be provid ed for 
ocular specific and all AEs (including systemic).  
Other safety endpoints including visual acuity, slit-lamp biomic roscopy, corneal 
sensitivity, dilated fundoscopy, intraocular pressure  will be summarized by 
treatment group and visit using descriptive statistics.  Changes or shifts from 
baseline will also b e summarized where appropriate.  For assessments  performed 
by eye, study eye and fellow eye may be summarized separately.  
Summary of Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects  
The previous human experience with topical naltrexone administered to the eyes of 
healthy volunteers and the non clinical safety studies conducted have indicated that 
topical naltrexone appears to be well tolerated. Nevertheless, patients will be closely 
monitored for safety -related issues.

1.1 Dry Eye Disease (DED)  
Dry Eye Disease (DED) is defined by the International Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS) as a 
multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the 
tear film, and accompanied by ocular symptoms, in which tear film instability and 
hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, and neurosensory 
abnormalities play etiological roles  (DEWS II Definition and Classification 2017).  As 
many as 5 - 35% of patients v isiting ophthalmic clinics report dry eye symptoms, making 
it one of the most common conditions seen by ophthalmic specialists (McCarty CA, et al. 
1998; Lin PY, et al. 2003). Estimates range from 20 million people in the United States 
(US) being affected with mild to moderate dry eye, to a high of as many as one out of every 
five Americans. Prevalence is greater in females and the elderly. Schaumberg et al . 
reported pr evalence rates ranging from 3.9% in men aged 50 –54 years to 7.7% in those 80 
years or older, while an increased rate from 5.7% in women younger than 50 years to 9.8% 
in women >75 years was observed (Schaumberg DA, et al. 2003). Prevalence is affected 
by ge ographical parameters and appears to be higher in Asian populations. Dry eye can be 
related to external factors, such as the low humidity of air conditioned offices, winter 
heating, a dusty or windy outdoor environment, prolonged computer use, or wearing 
contact lenses, as well as to internal factors, such as hormonal imbalance, autoimmune 
disease, the presence of many widely prescribed systemic medications, anatomical changes 
or trauma, and aging. Symptoms result in mildly decreased quality of life at a mi nimum, 
and with increasing severity, loss of function and productivity, pain, light sensitivity, and 
the misery that accompanies significantly impaired vision and decreased quality of life. 
With the aging population in the United States and other countries  of the developed world, 
and with increasing computer use, DED is expected to continue to become more prevalent 
and finding a treatment is becoming more important (Schaumberg DA, et al. 2009 ).  
STUDY TREATMENT  
Researchers at Pennsylvania State University/H ershey Medical Center have been 
exploring the role of the Opioid Growth Regulatory System (OGRS), which includes 
Opioid Growth Factor (OGF), and its receptor, OGFr, in the health and healing of the 
corneal epithelium for nearly 20 years. These studies incl uded evaluating the impact of 
the OGRS on healthy corneal epithelium and the healing of wounded corneal epithelium 
utilizing cell and organ culture. Experiments have been performed in living animals. 
Additionally, cell and organ culture experiments were pe rformed utilizing human eye 
bank corneas not suitable for transplantation. These studies have demonstrated the safety 
and efficacy of topically applied naltrexone in expediting the healing of corneal epithelial 
wounds in normal and diabetic rats. This rese arch led to an investigational drug study 
entitled: “Topical Application of Naltrexone to the Ocular Surface of Healthy Volunteers: 
A Tolerability Study” (Liang et al., Volume 32 (2), 2016, pp 127 -132; DOI: 
10.1089/jop.2015.0070). It was concluded that top ical naltrexone was  well tolerated in

7 STUDY MATERIALS  
7.1 Study Treatment(s)  
7.1.1 Study Treatment  
Naltrexone Ophthalmic solution will be formulated as a stable, sterile, topical, 
ophthalmic solution containing 21 μg/mL naltrexone hydrochloride in a multi -use 
container for topical administration to the eye. The study t reatment will be delivered as a 
drop in each eye BID:  
 Naltrexone Ophthalmic Solution, 0.002 % 
 Placebo Ophthalmic Solution  
 
7.1.2 Description of and Justification for the Route of Administration, Dosage, Dosage 
Regimen, and Treatment Period(s).  
Selection of Dose:  
Previous animal studies demonstrated that NTX dissolved in Vigamox® in the range of 
10-5 M or 10 -4 M was effective in reversing dry eye after 1 drop.  
In the human study, the highest dosage of NTX was 5 x 10 -5 M dissolved in Vigamox® 
and applied four times  over a 24 -hour period equaling 3.77 µg of NTX.  The compound 
was prepared by Skip’s Pharmacy, FL.  
These molar dosages of NTX were converted by Bionex to yield a final formulation 
containing 20 µg/ml NTX, with each drop (0.028 ml) containing 0.56 µg NTX (a ssuming 
~35.7 drops per ml).  In the proposed clinical trial, drops will be applied twice daily 
yielding a total NTX dosage of 1.12 µg over a 24 -hour period of time. This is one -third 
the clinical dosage shown to be safe for a 24 -hour period of time.  
Furth ermore, the 20 µg/ml NTX dosage used in the bridge studies was shown to be 
consistently more effective in comparison to the NTX (5x 10 -5 M) prepared in 
Vigamox®.  Moreover, the 20 µg/ml NTX dosage was applied 4 times daily for a period 
of 30 days in both r ats and rabbits and shown to be safe based on pathological assessment

Adverse Events  (AEs) (both elicited and observed) will be monitored throughout the 
study. All AEs (both elicited and observed) will be promptly reviewed by the investigator 
for accuracy and completeness. All AEs will be documented on the appropriate CRF.  
If a female has a positive pregnancy test during the study, then the investigator will notify 
Ora immediately. The investigator shall request from the subject and/or the subject’s 
physician copies of all related medical reports during the pregnancy and shall document 
the outcome of the pregnancy. The investigator will retain these reports together w ith the 
subject’s source documents and will provide a copy of all documentation to Ora.  
8.4 Schedule of Visits, Measurements and Dosing  
8.4.1 Scheduled Visits  
Refer to Appendix 1  for a schedule of visits and measurements.  
8.4.2 Unscheduled Visits  
These visits may be perfo rmed in order to ensure subject safety. All procedures 
performed at an unscheduled visit will be recorded in the source document s and on the 
Unscheduled Visit CRF pages. Any procedure indicated in the CRF that is not performed 
should be indicated as “Not d one.”  
Evaluations that may be conducted at an Unscheduled Visit include:  
 Slit-lamp Biomicroscopy;  
 Visual Acuity;  
 Intranasal Examination;  
 Urine Pregnancy Test (if applicable);

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 30 of 66 8.5 Compliance with Protocol  
Subjects will be instructed on the proper use and storage of the study drug  at Visits 1, 2, 
3, and 4, and provided with written instructions. Subject diaries and study drug will be 
collected at each visit from Visit 1 up to and including Visit 5 to assess subject 
compliance with the protocol.  
Subject dosing compliance will be determined by the subject’s re sponse or lack thereof to 
the prompt “Was the dose taken?” in the subject diary. If more than 20% of the responses 
to the total expected dose -taken prompts are checked “no,” left blank, or missing, then 
the subject will be deemed noncompliant for dosing an d a deviation recorded. In addition, 
if more than 20% of all expected diary symptom assessments are missed, then the subject 
will be deemed noncompliant and a diary deviation recorded.  
Subject’s bottles may also be weighed at each visit to determine dosing  accountability.  
8.6 Subject Disposition  
8.6.1 Completed Subjects  
A completed subject is one who has not been discontinued from the study.  
8.6.2 Discontinued Subjects  
Subjects may be discontinued prior to their completion of the study due to:  
 subject request/withdrawal  
 AEs 
 protocol violations  
 administrative reasons (e.g., inability to continue, lost to follow up)  
 sponsor termination of study  
 other  
Note: In addition, any subject may be discontinued for any sound medical reason.  
Notification of a subject discontinuation and the reason for discont inuation will be made 
to Ora  and will be clearly documented on the CRF.  
8.7 Study Termination  
The study may be stopped at any time b y the investigator  and/or Ora.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 31 of 66 8.9 Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
For the conduct of this trial, an assigned Ora, Inc. CRA will conduct an initial SIV, 
providing an in -depth review of the protocol with emphasis that the trial will be 
conducted according  to the pertinent regulatory requirements.   Interim monitoring visits 
(IMVs) are not planned, however to ensure patient safety and efficacy, weekly contact 
with PI or authorized delegate will occur in order to:  
 Confirm eligible subjects are being properly consented  
 Asse ss status and document any adverse events associated with the study 
procedures and IP.    Should there be any unexpected adverse events, or an 
abnormally high number of adverse events occurring among enrolled subjects, the 
CRA will alert the Lead CRA and Project Manager in order to determine whether 
an on -site IMV is warranted  
 Confirm administration and storage of IP is being conducted and monitored as per 
protocol design.  
At the conclusion of the trial, after all eligible/enrolled subjects ha ve had their last on -site 
visit, the CRA will conduct a Close -Out Visit (COV).   During the COV the CRA will:  
 Review all ICFs  
 Assess data integrity by selecting a random sampling of 10% of total subjects 
enrolled and conduct a thorough review of source to v erify adequacy of data 
collection (GDP), subject eligibility and safety (GCP).    
 CRA will query any discrepant data.   If any findings constitute Major protocol 
deviations, the Lead and PM will be notified to determine if additional data 
review is warranted . 
 Reconcile and return IP  
 Review and reconcile site’s ISF to Ora’s TMF.  
Further details of the study monitoring will be outlined in a monitoring plan.  
Regulatory authorities of domestic and foreign agencies and Ora, Inc. Quality Assurance 
and/or its design ees may carry out on -site inspections and/or audits which may include 
source data checks. Therefore, direct access to the original source data will be required 
for inspections and/or audits. All inspections and audits will be carried out giving 
considerati on to data protection as well as subject confidentiality to the extent that local, 
state, and federal laws apply.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 of 66 9 ADVERSE EVENTS  
9.1 Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an IP in 
humans, whether or not co nsidered IP -related. An AE can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an IP, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise 
from any use of the IP (e.g ., off -label use, use in combination with another drug or 
medical device) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an 
overdose. An AE can arise from any delivery, implantation, or use of a medical device, 
including medical devi ce failure, subject characteristics that may impact medical device 
performance (e.g., anatomical limitations), and therapeutic parameters (e.g., energy 
applied, sizing, dose release, and anatomic fit) associated with medical device use.  
All AEs spontaneous ly reported by the subject and/or in response to an open question 
from study personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination or other 
diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the source document and on the appropriate 
pages of the CRF. Any clin ically relevant deterioration in clinical finding is considered 
an AE and must be recorded. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event.  
Documentation regarding the AE should be made  as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
severity, and relationship to IP, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by the physician or reported by the subject upon indirect questioning.  
9.1.1 Severity  
Severity of an AE is de fined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an 
AE as determined by the investigator or reported to him/her by the subject. The 
assessment of severity is made irrespective of relationship to IP or seriousness of the 
event and should be e valuated according to the following scale:  
 Mild : Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
 Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
 Severe : Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of 
therapy, and interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
9.1.2 Relationship to Investigational Product  
The relationship of each AE to the IP should be determined by the investigator using 
these explanations:  
 Suspected : A reasonable possibility exists that the IP caused the AE. A suspected 
AE can be further defined as:  
Naltrexone Ophthalmic Solution  Ocunova, Inc.   
Clinical Trial Protocol: DDES001/ 18-110-0002  21 June 2018  
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 of 66  Definite : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence from 
the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of the drug 
class, is confirmed by improvement on stopping the IP and no other 
reasonable cause exists.  
 Probable : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence 
from the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of the 
drug class, is confirmed by improvement on stopping the IP and the suspect IP 
is the most likely of all causes.  
 Possib le: Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence 
from the time of IP administration, but could also have been produced by the 
subject’s clinical state or by other drugs administered to the subject.  
 Not Suspected: A reasonable possibility does not exist that the IP caused the AE.  
 Not Related:  Concurrent illness, concurrent medication, or other known cause 
is clearly responsible for the AE, the administration of the IP and the 
occurrence of the AE are not reasonably related in time, OR expos ure to IP 
has not occurred.  
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the IP caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the IP and the AE. Types of  evidence that would suggest a 
causal relationship between the IP and the AE event include: a single occurrence of an 
event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with IP exposure (e.g., 
angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome); one or more occurrences of an 
event that is not commonly associated with IP exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in 
the population exposed to the IP (e.g., tendon rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific 
events observed in a clinical trial (such as known  consequences of the underlying disease 
or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study 
population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more 
frequently in the IP -treatment group than in a concurre nt or historical control group.  
9.1.3 Expectedness  
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information 
about the IP using these explanations:  
 Unexpected: An AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
 Expected:  An AE that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has been 
observed.  
 Not applicable: An AE unrelated to the IP.  
AE events that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with  a class of products or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological/mechanical (or other) properties of the product, but 
are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular product under 
investigation are to be considered unexpected.  
Naltrexone Ophthalmic Solution  Ocunova, Inc.   
Clinical Trial Protocol: DDES001/ 18-110-0002  21 June 2018  
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34 of 66 The investigat or should initially classify the expectedness of an AE, but the final 
classification is subject to the Medical Monitor’s determination.  
9.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of the investigator , it results in any of the 
followi ng outcomes:  
 Death;  
 A life -threatening AE;  
Note: An AE is considered “life -threate ning” if, in the view of the investigator  its 
occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
Note: The term “inpatient hospitalization” refers to any inpatient admission (even if less 
than 24 hours). For chronic or long -term inpatients, inpatient admission includes transfer 
within the hospital to an acute/intensive care inpatient unit. Inpatient hospitalization does 
not in clude: emergency room visits; outpatient/same -day/ambulatory procedures; 
observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; hospice facilities; nursing homes; or 
clinical research/phase 1 units.  
Note: The term “prolongation of existing hospitalizatio n” refers to any extension of an 
inpatient hospitalization beyond the stay anticipated or required for the reason for the 
initial admission as determined by the investigator or treating physician.  
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disru ption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions;  
Note: A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would be 
interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g., 
hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central  corneal ulcer or damage to the optic nerve).  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment , they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
9.3 Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs and their outcomes must be reported to Ora and the IRB/IEC as requi red by the 
IRB/IEC, federal, state, or local regulations and governing health authorities and recorded 
on the appropriate CRF. AE’s will be collected from first dose of study drug to 30 days 
after treatment discontinuation.

Clinical Trial Protocol: DDES001/ 18-110-0002  21 June 2018  
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 35 of 66 9.3.1 Reporting a Suspected Unexpect ed Adverse Reaction  
All AEs that are ‘suspected’ and ‘unexpected’ are to be reported to Ora and the IRB/IEC 
as required by the IRB/IEC, federal, state, or local regulations and governing health 
authorities.  
9.3.2 Reporting a Serious Adverse Event  
To ensure subje ct safety, all SAEs, regardless of relationship to the IP, must be 
immediately reported. All information relevant to the SAE must be recorded on the 
appropriate CRFs. The investigator is obligated to pursue and obtain information 
requested by Ora in additi on to that information reported on the CRF. All subjects 
experiencing a SAE must be followed up and the outcome reported.  
In the event of a SAE, the investigator must notify Ora immediately; obtain and maintain 
in his/her files all pertinent medical record s, information, and medical judgments from 
colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow -up of the subject; provide Ora with a 
complete case history, which includes a statement as to whether the event was or was not 
suspected to be related to the use  of the IP; and inform the IRB of the SAE within their 
guidelines for reporting SAEs.  
Contact information for reporting SAEs and ADEs:  
 
Clinical Project Manager:  Phoebe Carter  
Company:  Ora, Inc.  
Office Telephone:  (978) 685 -8900 x9496  
Alternative Telephone:  (978) 409 -0955

9.4 Procedures for Unmasking (if applicable)  
All subjects, investigators, and study personnel involved with the conduct of the study 
will be masked with regard to treatment assignments. When medically necessary, the 
investigator may need to determine what treatment arm has been assigned to a subject. 
When possible (i.e., in non -emergent situations), Ora should be notified before 
unmasking study drug. Ora must be informed immediately about any unmasking event.  
If the  investigator identifies a medical need for unmasking the treatment  assignment of a 
subject, he  should contact Ora prior to unmasking the identity of the IP, if possible. Ora 
will ask the site to complete and send them the Unmasking Request Form. Ora will

Clinical Trial Protocol: DDES001/ 18-110-0002  21 June 2018  
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36 of 66 determine if the unmasking request should be granted. The result of the request will be 
documented on the Unmasking Request Form. If approval is granted to unmask a subject, 
written permission via the Unmasking Request Form will be p rovided to the investigator. 
The investigator will unmask the subject using the unmasking report. The investigator 
will complete the Unmasking Memo form and include it in the subject’s study file and 
provide a copy for the Trial Master File (TMF). For each  unmasked request, the reason, 
date, signature, and name of the person who unmasked the subject, must be noted in the 
subject’s study file. Unmasked subjects will be discontinued from the study.  
9.5 Type and Duration of the Follow -up of Subjects after Adverse Events  
The investigator will follow unresolved AEs to resolution until the subject is lost to 
follow -up or until the AE is otherwise classified. Resolution means the subject has 
returned to baseline state of health or the investigator does not expect any f urther 
improvement or worsening of the AE. If the subject is lost to follow -up, the investigator 
should make 3 reasonable attempts to contact the subject via telephone, post, or certified 
mail. All follow -up will be documented in the subject’s source docum ent. Non -serious 
AEs identified on the last scheduled cont act must be recorded on the AE CRF with the 
status noted.  
If the investigator becomes aware of any new information regarding an existing SAE 
(i.e., resolution, change in condition, or new treatment ), a new SAE/Unanticipated Report 
Form must be completed and faxed to Ora within 24 hours of the site’s awareness of the 
new information. The original SAE form is not to be altered. The report should describe 
whether the event has resolved or continues and  how the event was treated.  
10 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES AND METHODS OF ANALYSES  
10.1 Analysis Populations  
Analysis Populations  
 Modified Intent -to-Treat Population  – The modified intent -to-treat ( mITT) 
population includes all randomized subjects with at least one post visit 2 study 
assessment. Efficacy analysis will be performed on the mITT population. 
Subjects in the mITT population will be analyzed as randomized.  
 
 Safety Population – The safety population includes all subjects who have 
received at least one dose o f the investigational product. Subjects in the Safety 
population will be analyzed as treated.  
The statistical analysis of s afety data will be performed for the safety population. The 
analysis of baseline and all efficacy data will be performed for the mITT population.  
Sample Size:

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 of 66 With a sample size of 60 subjects in the Safety and Efficacy Assessment , the study 
will have 79% probability of detecting AEs occurring at a rate of 5% or more in either 
treatment arm.  
Multiplicity Consideration : 
There will be  no adjustments for multiple endpoints or multiple treatment 
comparisons for this early phase, exploratory study.  
Safety Variables:  
Frequencies and percentages of subjects with treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), serious TEAEs, and TEAEs causing pre mature discontinuation will b e 
provided by treatment group. An AE is treatment emergent if it occurs or worsens 
after the first dose of study treatment.  Separate summaries  will be provid ed for ocular 
specific and all AEs (including systemic).  
Other safety endpoints including visual acuity, slit -lamp biomic roscopy, corneal 
sensitivity, dilated fundoscopy, intraocular pressure  will be summarized by treatment 
group and visit using descriptive statistics.  Changes or shifts from baseline will also 
be summarized  where appropriate.  For assessments performed by eye, study eye and 
fellow eye may be summarized separately. Summaries of the comfort data from the 
Comfort Assessment of the study will be performed on the safety population from 
that Assessment. The statist ical analysis of safety data will be performed for the 
safety population , separately for the Comfort Assessment and the Safety and Efficacy 
Assessment of the study . The analysis of baseline and all efficacy data in the Safety 
and Efficacy Assessment of the  study will be performed for the mITT population.  
The efficacy analys es may also be performed o n the PP population  as sensitivity 
analyses . 
 
10.2 Statistical Hypotheses  
For each efficacy endpoint and time point, the statistical hypotheses are as follows:  
H0: There is no difference between the Naltrexone  Ophthalmic Solution  treatment 
group and placebo for the respective endpoint . 
H1: There is a difference between the Naltrexone  Ophthalmic Solution treatment 
group  and placeb o for the respective endpoint. A differ ence in favor of Naltrexone  
Ophthalmic Solution s will be considered a success for that endpoint.  
10.3  Sample Size  
The study is not powered to show statistical differences for any of the efficacy 
endpoints. The sample size was determined based on prior clinical trial experience 
with in subjects with dry eye syndrome and is deemed to be robust sufficient to

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 46 of 66 APPENDIX 2: EXAMINAT ION PROCEDURES, TEST S, EQUIPMENT, AND  
TECHNIQUES   
Visual Acuity Procedures (ETDRS Chart)  
LogMAR visual acuity (VA) must be assessed using an Early Treatment Diabetic 
Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. The procedure used will be consistent with the 
recommendations provided for using the ETDRS eye chart. VA should be evaluated at 
the beginning of each visit in the study (i.e., prior to slit -lamp examination). VA testing 
should be done  with most recent correction.  
Equipment  
The VA chart to be used is the ETDRS chart. If smaller reproduction (18"  by 18", e.g., 
from Prevent Blindness) wall charts are used, the subject viewing distance should be 
exactly 10  feet (or as specified by the manu facturer). In ALL cases, for purposes of 
standardizing the testing conditions during the study, all sites must use only the 'R' charts, 
and the right eye should be tested first. For reflectance (wall) charts, the chart should be 
placed frontally and well -illuminated.  
Measurement Technique  
The chart should be at a comfortable viewing angle. The right eye should be tested first. 
The subject should attempt to read each letter, line -by-line, left to right, beginning with 
line 1 at the top of the chart. The subj ect should be told that the chart has letters only, no 
numbers. If the subject reads a number, he or she should be reminded that the chart 
contains no numbers, and the examiner should then request a letter in lieu of the number. 
The subject should be asked  to read slowly, so as to achieve the best identification of 
each letter. He/she is not to proceed to the next letter until he/she has given a definite 
response.  
If the subject changes a response (e.g., that was a "C" not an "O") before he has read 
aloud t he next letter, then the change must be accepted. If the subject changes a response 
having read the next letter, then the change is not to be accepted. The examiner should 
never point to the chart or to specific letters on the chart during the test.  
A maxi mum effort should be made to identify each letter on the chart. When the subject 
says he or she cannot read a letter, he or she should be encouraged to guess. If the subject 
identifies a letter as 1 of 2 letters, he or she should be asked to choose 1 lette r and, if 
necessary, to guess. When it becomes evident that no further meaningful readings can be 
made, despite encouragement to read or guess, the examiner should stop the test for that 
eye. However, all letters on the last line should be attempted as let ter difficulties vary and 
the last may be the only one read correctly. The number of letters missed or read 
incorrectly should be noted.   
Naltrexone Ophthalmic Solution  Ocunova, Inc.   
Clinical Trial Protocol: DDES001/ 18-110-0002  21 June 2018  
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 47 of 66 LogMAR Visual Acuity Calculations  
The last line in which a letter is read correctly will be taken as the base logMAR r eading. 
To this value will be added the number "N x 0.02" where 'N' represents the total number 
of letters missed up to and included in the last line read. This total sum represents the 
logMAR VA for that eye.  
For example: Subject correctly reads 4 of 5 le tters on the 0.2  line, and 2 of 5 letters on the 
0.1 line.  
Base logMAR  = 0.1  
N (total number of letters incorrect on line 0.2 as 
well as 0.1)  = 4 
N x T (T=0.02)  = 0.08  
Base logMAR + (N x T)  = 0.1 + 0.08  
logMAR VA  = 0.18  
Repeat the procedure for the left eye.  
In order to provide standardized and well -controlled assessments of VA during the study, 
all VA assessments at a single site must be consistently done using the same lighting 
conditions and same correction if possible during the entire study. If the same correction 
cannot be used (i.e., a subject forgets his glasses), the reason for the change in correction 
should be documented.  
Note: A clinically significant visual acuity decrease (defined as an increase of 0.22 or 
greater in logM AR score) from b aseline (Visit 1 ) will be considered an Adverse Event.  
Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy Procedures  
Slit lamp biomicroscopic observations will be graded as Normal or Abnormal. Abnormal 
findings will be categorized as clinically significant (findings that may interfere with 
study parameters or otherwise confound the data as determined by the investigator)  or not 
clinically significant (NCS). The following will be examined:  
 Cornea  
 Conjunctiva  
 Anterior Chamber  
 Iris 
 Lens

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 48 of 66  Eyelid  
External magnification and biomicroscopy will be performed using a slit -lamp. 
Magnification will be consistent with standard clinic al practice. The subject will be 
seated.  
Dilated Fundoscopy  
Dilated fundus exams will be performed using indirect ophthalmoscopy. The investigator 
will make observations of the vitreous, retina, macula, choroid and optic nerve.   
Observations will be grade d as Normal or Abnormal. Abnormal findings that are 
clinically significant (as determined by the investigator that may interfere with study 
parameters or otherwise confound the data) and those that are not clinically significant 
will be described. An indir ect Fundoscopy examination should be performed if retinal 
disease is detected. A 78 or 90 diopter lens should also be used as needed.  
 Vitreous:  Examination should emphasize the visual axis.  
 Retina, Macula, Choroid:  Include an observation of the retina and its blood 
vessels. Eyes should be excluded from the study if active inflammation is present.  
 Optic Nerve:  Significant damage or cupping to the optic nerve should be noted.  
 
It is recommended that tropicamide 1% ophthalmic solution be used to dilate subjects. 
The use of cyclopentolate 1% ophthalmic solution is recommended as secondary dilating 
medication, should the need arise.   
Intraocular Pressure  
Intraocular pressure (IOP)  will be measured in each eye by contact tonometry by the 
examiner and the results will be recorded in mmHg.   A single measurement is made to 
obtain a determination of IOP.   The same tonometer employing the investigator’s 
standard technique will be used th roughout the study.   In addition, all reasonable efforts 
will be made to have the same examiner obtain all IOP measurements for a given subject.

Tear Film Break -Up Time (TFBUT)  
The examiner will instill 5 L of 2% preservative -free sodium fluorescein solution into 
the inferior conjunctival cul -de-sac of each eye.  To thoroughly mix the fluorescein with 
the tear film, the subject will be instructed to blink several times.  In order to achieve 
maximum fluoresc ence, the examiner should wait approximately 30 seconds after 
instillation before evaluating TFBUT.    
With the aid of a slit -lamp, the examiner will monitor the integrity of the tear film, noting 
the time it takes to form micelles from the time that the e ye is opened.  TFBUT will be 
measured in seconds using a stopwatch and a digital image recording system for the right 
eye followed by the left eye.  A Wratten #12 yellow filter will be used to enhance the 
ability to grade TFBUT.   
For each eye, 2 measureme nts will be taken and averaged unless the 2 measurements are

the moistened area will be recorded (mm) for each eye.  
Corneal Sensitivity  
The aesthesiometer  (Cochet –Bonnet) is a nylon thread contained in a pen –like case that 
can be extended specific distances from the tip of the case. The following steps will be 
followed by the examiner for evaluating corneal sensitivity:  
1. Remove Cochet –Bonnet from box.

the readings will be incorrect and the filament should not be used).  
3. The examiner will inform the subject that a thin delicate plastic filament will be used 
to test their cornea l sensitivity and that they will feel the sensation similar to a strand 
of hair on their eye. (If the subject is hesitant, a spot on the subject’s hand will be 
cleaned with an alcohol pad and the filament touched to the hand to demonstrate the 
painless con tact).  
4. The examiner will instruct the subject to say “Yes” when they feel sensation on their 
eyeball.  
5. The examiner will place their free hand on the cheek below the eye being measured to 
stabilize subject’s head position.  
6. The examiner will position their hand with the device such that the filament is normal 
(90 degree angle with corneal surface). The device should be between the examiner’s 
index, middle finger, and thumb.  
7. The examiner will extend fingers such that the filament applies gentle pressure on th e 
central corneal surface. The examiner will then ask subject if they can perceive the 
filament touching the central corneal surface.  
If the subject responds “Yes”, the examiner will ensure the response is valid by 
performing a sham (not touching the corne a) application and also confirm that 
response was not due to eyelids touching the filament.  
If the subject responds “No”, then the filament is shortened the length by 5mm and 
reapplied to the cornea.  
If the subject responds “Yes”, record length; if the su bject responds “No”, go to  
step b.  
Step 7 is repeated 3 times.  
The filament is retracted such that only 10 mm are exposed.  
The tip is wiped with an alcohol pad gently ENSURING that it does NOT bend the 
filament.  
The alcohol is allowed to dry before reusing device (alcohol can cause corneal abrasions).

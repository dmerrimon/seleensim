order to determine more accurately if the subject was HCC-free during the course of the observation period.
●Update Section 5.3.2.1 , Collection of Samples for Analysis.
Rationale:   To clarify pharmacokinetic samples are not to be collected on 
Day 1 and dosing on Week 4 is not required to occur at the site. 
●Update Section 5.4.1.1 , HCV Virologic Failure Criteria.
Rationale:   The section was re-written to clarify the HCV virologic failure 
criteria and that cases of confirmed HCV reinfection, for which a definition 
was provided, are excluded from the definition of relapse.

immunoglobulin test and replacing it with anti-hepatitis A virus total test as a 
result of an error in the original list of tests.  
●Update Section 8.1, Statist ical and Analyti cal Plans.
Rationale:   To specify that an interim analysis may be conducted as part of 
regulatory authority interactions. 
●Update Section 8.1.2.1 , Primary Efficacy Endpoints.
Rationale:   The text was updated to comply with Regulatory Authority 
feedback, which requested that, for high SVR12 rates that are less than 100%,

Protocol Title:   An Open-Label, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 
ABT-493/ABT-530 in Combination with Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin in Chronic Hepatitis C (HCV) 
Infected Subjects Who Have Experienced Virologic Failure in AbbVie HCV Clinical Studies (MAGELLAN-3)
Objectives:
!The primary objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy by evaluating the percentage of subjects achieving a 12-week post-treatment sustained virologic failure response (SVR
12) in 
each treatment arm and safety of ABT-493/ABT-530 plus SOF and RBV in adults or adolescents with chronic HCV GT1-6 infection who previously failed HCV treatment in an AbbVie HCV clinical study, designated as an AbbVie HCV parent study.  
!Secondary objectives are to assess the percentage of subjects with HCV on-treatment virologic failure, and the percentage of subjects with HCV virologic relapse. 
Investigators:   Multicenter; investigator information on file at AbbVie
Study Sites:   Approximately 40 sites who participated in an AbbVie HCV parent study.  
Study Population:   Subjects who have experienced virologic failure after receiving regimens containing 
ABT-493/ABT-530 in an AbbVie HCV parent study.  Subjects who have experienced virologic failure during or after receiving ombitasvir/paritaprevir/r + dasabuvir (3D), ombitasvir/paritaprevir/r (2D) in an AbbVie HCV parent study may be enrolled at AbbVie's discretion.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 50 subjects.

Methodology:
This is a Phase 3b, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
ABT-493/ABT-530 in combination with SOF and RBV in HCV GT1 – 6-infected subjects including subjects with compensated cirrhosis and/or HIV-1 coinfection who have experienced virologic failure while participating in an AbbVie HCV parent study.  Approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled.  Treatment arm allocation will be based on HCV genotype, cirrhosis status, and treatment experience with protease inhibitor (PI) and/or NS5A inhibitor (NS5Ai)-containing regimens prior to enrolling in the AbbVie HCV parent study.

assigned to Arm B (16 weeks), regardless of the cirrhosis status or PI and/or NS5Ai use prior to the AbbVie 
HCV Parent Study.
!Arm A:  Subjects will receive orally ABT-493/ABT-530 300/120 mg QD, SOF 400 mg QD, 
RBV 600 mg to 1200 mg daily in two divided doses (based on baseline age and weight) for 12 weeks
!Arm B:  Subjects will receive orally ABT-493/ABT-530 300/120 mg QD, SOF 400 mg QD, RBV 600 mg to 1200 mg daily in two divided doses (based on baseline age and weight) for 16 weeks
Arm A will enroll approximately 5 subjects, and Arm B will enroll approximately 45 subjects.  All subjects administered at least one dose of study drugs will be followed for 24 weeks in the Post-Treatment Period to monitor HCV RNA and to evaluate efficacy and the emergence and/or persistence of resistance-associated viral variants.
Planned visits in the Treatment Period consist of Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 for all subjects and an 
additional Week 16 visit for subjects in Arm B.  During the Post-Treatment Period, subjects will have visits at Post-Treatment Weeks 4, 12, and 24.  Efficacy and safety data will be monitored throughout the study.  As this is an open-label study, safety will be reviewed by AbbVie.

Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects who achieve SVR 12(HCV RNA < LLOQ 
12 weeks after the last actual dose of study drug) in each treatment arm and overall.  The primary 
endpoint will be analyzed based on intention to treat (ITT) population.  The number and percentage of subjects achieving SVR
12will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using the 
normal approximation to the binomial distribution, unless the number of virologic failures is less than 5, then the Wilson's score method will be used for the confidence interval instead.
The secondary efficacy variables are:
!The percentage of subjects with on-treatment HCV virologic failure in each treatment arm and 
overall;
!The percentage of subjects with post-treatment HCV virologic relapse in each treatment arm and overall.
The number and percentage of subjects meeting each secondary efficacy endpoint will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using the Wilson score method.  Analyses of additional efficacy endpoints and efficacy s ubgroup analyses will be performed.
Resistance:
For all subjects receiving study drugs and with available samples, the variants at signature resistance-
associated amino acid positions at baseline identified by next generation sequencing (NGS) and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence will be analyzed.
The following resistance information will be analyzed for subjects receiving study drugs who do not 
achieve SVR
12and who have a post-baseline sample with HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL:  1) the amino acid 
variants in available post-baseline samples identified by NGS and comparison to the baseline sequence, 
2) the amino acid variants in available post-baseline samples at signature resistance-associated positions identified by NGS and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence, and 3) the persistence of viral variants by NGS.
Pharmacokinetic:
Plasma concentrations of ABT-493, ABT-530, SOF, primary metabolite of SOF (GS-331007), and RBV 
will be tabulated for each subject and treatment arm.  Summary statistics will be computed for each 
treatment arm.
Safety:
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drugs will be included in the safety analyses.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Safety summaries will be provided by treatment arm and overall.  The number and percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (i.e., any event that begins or worsens in severity after initiation of study drug) will be tabulated by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term 
(PT).  The tabulation of the number of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events also will be 
provided by grade and relationship to study drug.  Change from baseline in laboratory tests and vital signs measurements to each time point of collection will be summarized, and values that are potentially clinically significant, according to predefined criteria, will be summarized by treatment arm and overall.

3.0 Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is  a global health problem, with over 
170 million indi viduals infected worldwide.1  There are six major HCV genotypes (GT), 
GT1 to GT6, and each genotype expresses a distinct epidemiological pattern across the 
world.  Patients with chronic HCV infection are at high risk of developing cirrhosis, death related to the complications of cirrhosis, and developing hepatocellular carcinoma.
2  
Successful treatment of HCV was shown to significantly reduce the risk of disease progression and related mortality as well as the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
3,4
Currently approved IFN-free and, in some cases, RBV-free DAA combination regimens, such as sofosbuvir (SOF)/ledipasvir (LDV), ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with (3D) or without (2D) dasabuvir, SOF and daclatasvir (DCV), and elbasvir/grazoprevir represent substantial progress in the treatment of HCV infection.  These regimens are associated with significant improvement of the sustained virologic response (SVR) rate and safety profile in the approved patient populations.  However, these IFN-free regimens are not equally potent across all HCV genotypes and subtypes, and across all subpopulations.  They may require co-administration with RBV in some sub-populations.
The next generation DAA regimens have high potencies across all HCV genotypes and 
across patient subpopulations, including Abbvie's ABT-493/ABT-530 or glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB).  GLE/PIB is approved in some parts of the world, including Europe and the United States, under the brand name MAVIRET
®or 
MAVYRET™, respectively.
ABT-493 (NS3/4A protease inhibitor [PI]) and ABT-530 (NS5A inhibitor [NS5Ai]) are 
denoted as next generation compounds because they each demonstrated potent pan-genotypic antiviral activity against all major HCV genotypes, i.e., GT1 through GT6 and 
they are potent against known common single resistance-associated amino acid variants with no or little loss of potency.

M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26

ABT-493
ABT-493 is an NS3/4A protease inhibitor (PI) with potent, pangenotypic activity and a 
high barrier to resistance with activity against common variants that emerge following 
exposure to first generation PIs.  AbbVie is developing ABT-493 to be used in combination with the NS5A inhibit or ABT-530 for the treatment of chronic HCV 
infection.  ABT-493 is highly active against replicons containing wild-type HCV NS3 from GT1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.  ABT-493 activity against GT5 NS3 is unknown because a 
replicon with GT5 NS3 is not currently available ( Table 1 ).  Based on findings that each 
of 5 well characterized HCV PIs, including 2 linear and 3 macrocyclic PIs, demonstrated similar activity against GT2a, 5a, and 6a NS3 protease,
5it is predicted ABT-493 would 
inhibit NS3 protease of GT5a with activity similar to that of GT2a and 6a.

The pharmacokinetics of ABT-493 has been evaluated at doses up to 1200 mg QD.  
ABT-493 reached T maxaround 3 to 4 hours with an elimination half-life of 6 to 9 hours.  
ABT-493 exposures increased in a greater than dose proportional manner across the 25 mg to 1200 mg dose range.  Orally administered ABT-493 was predominantly cleared 
through the biliary-fecal route.  The percentages of the ABT-493 dose recovered in urine were less than 4%.  No metabolite was identified in systemic circulation.
In summary, ABT-493 is a potent, pangenotypic PI with high potential for treatment of 
chronic HCV infection.  A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology, metabolism, 
and pharmacology and Phase I data can be found in the Investigator's Brochure.

ABT-530
ABT-530 is an NS5A inhibitor (NS5Ai) with potent, pangenotypic activity and a high barrier to resistance with activity agains t common variants that emerge following 
exposure to first generation NS5Ai.  ABT-530 is highly active against HCV replicons containing wild-type HCV NS5A from GT1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 ( Table 3 ).

ABT-530 retains activity against common single resistance-associated amino acid variants 
in NS5A ( Table 4 ).  ABT-530 is > 100-fold more active than the first generation NS5Ai 
(ombitasvir, daclatasvir, and ledipasvir) against key resistance-associated variants selected by these inhibitors in the clinic at GT1 NS5A amino acid positions 28, 30, 31, and 93.  Its genetic barrier to resistance is higher than that of ombitasvir across all GTs.

The pharmacokinetics of ABT-530 has been evaluated at doses up to 600 mg QD.  
ABT-530 reached a T maxaround 3 to 5 hours, with an elimination half-life of 12 to 
17 hours.  ABT-530 exposures increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner across the 1.5 mg to 120 mg dose range and approximately dose proportionally from the 120 mg to 600 mg single doses.  ABT-530 undergoes minimum renal elimination.  Orally administered ABT-530 was predominantly cleared through the biliary-fecal route as unchanged parent drug.
In summary, ABT-530 is a potent, pangenotypic NS5Ai with high potential for treatment 
of chronic HCV infection.  A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology, 
metabolism, and pharmacology and Phase 1 data can be found in the Investigator's
Brochure.

ABT-493 and ABT-530
When ABT-493 was given in combination with ABT-530 in healthy volunteers, preliminary results showed ABT-493 exposures were not significantly changed when co-administered with ABT-530 ( ≤ 31% difference); however, the exposure of ABT-530 
increased in an ABT-493-dose-dependent manner (from 1.5-fold at 100 mg ABT-493 up to 3- to 4-fold at 400 mg ABT-493).
Results of clinical DDI studies conducted to date have shown that as perpetrators of DDIs, 
ABT-493/ABT-530 combination had no clinically meaningful impact on drugs that are substrates of CYP or UGT enzymes.  The ABT-493/ABT-530 combin ation increased 
exposure of substrates for P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 transporters.  
Except for some OATP inhibitors (e.g., high dose cyclosporine), ritonavir-boosted 
protease inhibitors and P-gp inducers, ABT-493 and ABT-530 exposures were minimally affected by co-administrations of other drugs.  ABT-493 is a substrate of OATP and inhibition of OATP increases ABT-493 exposure.  When ABT-493 + ABT-530 was administered with cyclosporine (400 mg), an OATP inhibitor, ABT-493 exposure was up to 5.1-fold of DAAs alone.  The increased exposures observed were not associated with 
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
26
clinically significant safety findings.  Protease inhibitors, as a class, have potential to 
inhibit OATP, thus larger exposure increases in ABT-493 with ritonavir boosted proteaseinhibitors than with ritonavir alone may result from interaction of ABT-493 with both the protease inhibitor and ritonavir components.
ABT-493/ABT-530 possesses greater antiviral activity as compared to the 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir regimen, while also maintaining adequate activity against va riants that confer resistance to ombitasvir and paritaprevir.

HCV/HIV-1 Co-Infection
HCV and HIV-1 co-infection is associ ated with accelerated hepatic fibrosis progression 
and higher rates of liver decompensation and death compared to HCV monoinfection, and liver disease is a leading cause of non-A IDS-related mortality among HIV-1-infected 
patients.
25-27  Treatment of HIV-1 with antiretrovi ral therapy and treatment of HCV have 
independently been shown to delay the progression of fibrosis and reduce complications from end-stage liver disease among co-infected patients.
28,29
According to data from different trials, the eff ectiveness of DAA-based therapy appears to 
be similar between HCV mono-infected individuals and HCV/HIV-1 co-infected individuals, as shown in Table 5 .
30  Per the most recent AASLD treatment guidelines, it is 
recommended that HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients be treated and re-treated the same as HCV mono-infected patients, albeit with attention paid to potential drug-drug interactions with anti-retroviral medications.

ARV Drug-Drug Interaction Studies with ABT-493 and ABT-530
Phase 1 DDI studies of the ABT-493 + ABT-530 combination with HIV antiretroviral 
(ARV) drugs have been conducted in healthy volunteers and/or HIV-1 infected subjects.
The ABT-493 + ABT-530 combination had no clinically meaningful impact on the 
exposures ( ≤80%) of evaluated ARV regimens: ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors 
(darunavir, lopinavir), rilpivirine, raltegravir, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF).  ABT-493 and ABT-530 exposures were not affected by rilpivirine and raltegravir.  
Dolutegravir, lamivudine and abacavir (Triumeq
®) coadministered with ABT-493 + 
ABT-530 has recently been evaluated in a DDI Study M15-584.  Coadministration was 
safe and well tolerated with mild side effects reported.  ABT-493 and ABT-530 had no 
impact on dolutegravir, lamivudine and abacavir exposures.  There was a mild decrease in ABT-493 and ABT-530 exposures of no clinical significance.

Efavirenz induces P-gp and exposures of ABT-493 and ABT-530 in the presence of 
efavirenz were approximately 3- and 2-fold lower, respectively, and thus will not be 
allowed in this study.
When ABT-493 was administered with ritonavir, exposure of ABT-493 was 2-fold of 
ABT-493 exposure alone.  Coadministration of ABT-493 + ABT-530 with ritonavir boosted protease inhibitors, darunavir QD or lopinavir BID resulted in further increases in ABT-493 exposure of 3- to < 5-fold and < 2 fo ld exposure to ABT-530 without change in 
the LPV or DRV exposures.  In spite of the increase in ABT-493 exposures while coadministered with DRV/r or LPV/r, it was well tolerated, with mild side effects.  Coadministration of ABT-493 + ABT-530 with ritonavir boos ted atazanavir was studied 
in a DDI study that was terminated early due to an increase in ABT-493 exposure up to 
16-fold and ABT-530 exposure up to 3-fold with Grade 1 and 2 increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Grade 2 to 3 increase in total b ilirubin (predominately 
indirect).  
Study M15-584 evaluated the drug interaction profile when ABT-493/ABT-530 
300 mg/120 mg is co-administered with Genvoya
®(elvitegravir 150 mg, cobicistat 
150 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, tenofovir alafenamide10 mg QD).  Co-administration was 
safe and well tolerated, with mild side effects reported and one grade 3 neutropenia deemed related to the combination of Genvoya, ABT-493 and ABT-530 in a black male subject with baseline low absolute neutrophil count (ANC), leading to premature study drug discontinuation.  The ABT-493 exposure  increased 3-fold and the ABT-530 
exposure increased 57%, with non-clinically significant increase in elvitegravir and cobicistat exposures.  Thus, cobicistat boosted elvitegravir will be allowed in this study.  
In addition, ritonavi r and cobicistat-boosted HIV-1 protease inhibitors (darunavir and 
lopinavir) will be allowed in the non-cirrhotic  arm only.  These HIV-1 protease inhibitors 
will not be allowed in cirrhotic subjects, as the ABT-493 predicted exposures in this 
population approach the ALT 5% Grade 2 threshold.

Clinical Study Results
Studies M14-867 and M14-868 (data on file)13are Phase 2 studies designed to assess the 
efficacy and safety of the combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530 in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic subjects with HCV GT1 – 6 infect ion following 8 or 12 weeks of administration.  
In these two studies, high SVR rates have been achieved for the combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530 at the dose strength consistent with the Phase 3 doses, i.e., ABT-493 300 mg and ABT-530 120 mg ( Table 6 ).  In Studies M14-867 and M14-868, all subjects 
(N = 147) with HCV GT1, GT2, GT4, GT5 and GT6 infection have achieved SVR
12, 
following 8 or 12 weeks of treatment and a high SVR 12rate of 96% has been achieved for 
GT3 infected subjects (107/111).
Study M15-410 is a Phase 2 study designed to  assess the efficacy and safety of the 
combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530 in subjects who failed a prior DAA-containing 
therapy.  Prior DAA treatment regimens among enrolled include SOF/LDV (n = 8), SMV 
+ SOF ± RBV (n = 8), 3D ± RBV (n = 4), DSV + FDV + RDV ± RBV (n = 4), SAM + SMV (n = 2), TVR + PR (n = 8), BOC + PR (n = 10), DCV ± PR (n = 2).  The most common NS3 RAVs at baseline include Q80 (n = 22), R155 (n = 4), and D168 (n = 4), and the most common NS5A RAVs at baseline include Q30 (n = 14) and Y93 (n = 10).  Six out of 6 subjects on ABT-493 200 mg and ABT-530 120 mg, and 20 out of 22 subjects on ABT-493 300 mg and ABT-530 120 mg plus RBV 800 mg have achieved SVR
12.  Twenty one out of 22 subjects (95%) who were treated with the ABT-493 300 mg 
and ABT-530 120 mg combination therapy have achieved SVR 12.  A summary of the 
SVR rates of ABT-493/ABT-530 300 mg/120 mg in the Phase 2 Studies M14-867, M14-868 and M1 5-410 is presented in Table 6 .

The combination therapy of ABT-493 and ABT-530 is well tolerated and the most 
frequently reported adverse events were fatigue, nausea, and headache (occurring in > 5% 
of subjects) with the majority being Grade 1 or 2 in severity.  Among the 274 subjectswho received at least one dose of study drug in the Phase 2 studies, Studies M14-867 and M14-868, there were 4 (1.5%) treatment-emergent SAEs reported:  pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, B-cell ly mphoma, and metastatic prostate cancer, and all assessed as having 
no reasonable possibility of being related to ABT-493 or ABT-530.  Two subjects (0.7%; 2/274) discontinued due to treatment-emergent adverse events.  One subject with history of irritable bowel disease discontinued due to  Grade 2 AE of abdominal pain assessed as 
having a reasonable possibility of being related to both th e DAAs and RBV .  In all 
subjects with baseline ALT elevations in Studies M14-867 and M14-868, the ALT levels 
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
31
were normalized or trended toward normal with DAA treatment, and there have been no 
on-treatment ALT elevations above baseline.
A total of 2,376 subjects were randomized or enrolled in the registrational studies or 
supportive Phase 2 studies to receive GLE 300 mg QD and PIB 120 mg QD.  Of these, 2,369 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug.
Sofosbuvir (SOF)
SOF is a nucleotide analog NS5B polymerase inhibitor active against all major genotypes.  
SOF is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection as a component of a combination antiviral treatment regimen.  The approved dose is 400 mg orally once daily, without regard to food.
45  
A study to assess the PK and safety of co-administration of 400 mg QD SOF in combination with ABT-493 400 mg QD and ABT-530 120 mg QD in healthy subjects (Study M14-532) showed minimal effect ( ≤ 16% change in central values) on the steady-
state exposures of ABT-493 and ABT-530 compared to the administration of ABT-493/ABT-530 combination alone.  SOF C
maxand AUC 0-24central values were 
increased by 66% and 125%, respectively, compared to SOF alone, however, GS-331007 C
maxand AUC 0-24were minimally affected ( ≤ 21% change in central values).
Comprehensive safety, efficacy and PK i nformation is contained within the SOF 
USPI/SmPC/local label.
Ribavirin (RBV)
RBV is a guanosine analogue that has little or no effect on HCV RNA as monotherapy, 
but when combined with interferon-based therapies, RBV improves SVR rate over conventional or pegIFN monotherapy.
46,47
RBV is a known teratogen (FDA category X).  Pregnancy should be avoided following RBV therapy (Refer to Section 6.1.6 ).  Comprehensive safety, efficacy and PK 
information is contained within the RBV USPI/SmPC/local label.

3.1 Differences Statement
Study M15-942 is the first study to investig ate ABT-493/ABT-530 in combination with 
SOF and RBV as a retreatment option for subjects infected with HCV GT1 – 6, with or 
without HIV-1 co-infection, who experienced virologic failure following treatment with ABT-493/ABT-530 in a previous AbbVie HCV clinical trial, designated as the AbbVie HCV parent study.  Subjects who have experienced virologic failure following treatment with 3D or 2D in an AbbVie HCV parent study may be enrolled at AbbVie's discretion.
3.2 Benefits and Risks
Benefits
Subjects who have experienced virolo gic failure following treatment with 
ABT-493/ABT-530, as well as treatment with 3D or 2D, are difficult patient populations 
to cure and need effective and safe options for retreatment.  Study M15-942 is designed to retreat these subjects with an intensified regimen that contains ABT-493, an NS3/4A inhibitor; ABT-530, an NS5A inhibitor; SOF, an NS5B inhibitor and RBV, for either 12 weeks or 16 weeks.  
One of the potential benefits of retreatment with ABT-493/ABT-530 plus SOF and RBV 
is that the co-administration of drugs of distinct mechanisms of action can potently inhibit the viral replication of HCV variants prese nt in DAA treatment-experienced subjects 
effectively, thus leading to a higher cure rate.
ABT-493/ABT-530 demonstrates excellent antiviral activity with high genetic barrier to 
development of drug resistance which has been translated into high SVR
12rates in clinical 
studies.  The addition of SOF and RBV to ABT-493/ABT-530 provides additional mechanism(s) 
of action that may overcome re sistant variants selected in subjects exposed to 
ABT-493/ABT-530 alone.  The longer treatm ent duration of 16 weeks for cirrhotic 
subjects, subjects with GT3 infection, and subjects who have previously failed a PI-
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
33
and/or NS5Ai-containing regimen before experiencing virologic failure in an AbbVie 
HCV parent study is expected to improve the chances of achieving SVR 12.
SVR rates among HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients treated with new, all-oral HCV DAA regimens are comparable to those observed in HCV-monoinfected patients, and this similar efficacy finding is anticipated following treatment with ABT-493/ABT-530.  In addition, successfully treating these patients is expected to address the risk of increased disease progression in untreated HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients (accelerated hepatic fibrosis progression and higher rates of liver decompensation and death compared to HCV monoinfection).  Also, liver disease is a leading cause of non-AIDS-related mortality 
among HIV-1-infected patients.
25-27
Risks
The likelihood of successfully retreating HCV infection with ABT-493/ABT-530 plus SOF and RBV is not known.  
The safety profile of SOF and RBV are well established.  Adverse events that are known 
as well as those not previously described may occur with the combination of ABT-493/ABT-530 plus SOF and RBV, as detailed in the informed consent for this study.  
In addition, subjects may experience inconvenience or discomfort related to the study visits or study procedures.  Additional safety data for each drug alone and the combination of ABT-493/ABT- 530 plus SOF and RBV ar e detailed in Section 3.0and in the 
Investigator's Brochure or product package inserts.
Additional risks associated with ABT-493/ABT-530 plus SOF and RBV, including the 
risks of toxicity, virologic failure, and development of resistance-associated variants (Section 5.6.4 ), appear to be limited and manageable based upon the available data. 
Virologic failure criteria have been incorporated into the study to ensure subjects are exposed to appropriate durations of the regimen.  
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
34
Given the potential benefits of expected high SVR 12rates in a population of subjects who 
failed multiple classes of DAAs, as well as the limited risks associated with the planned 
therapy, the risk-benefit assessment is favorable.
4.0 Study Objective
●The primary objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy by evaluating the 
percentage of subjects achieving a 12-week post-treatment sustained virologic 
response (SVR 12) in each treatment arm and safety of ABT-493/ABT-530 plus 
SOF and RBV in adults or adolescents with chronic HCV GT1 - 6 infection 
who previously failed HCV treatment in an AbbVie HCV clinical study, 
designated as an AbbVie HCV parent study.
●Secondary objectives are to assess the percentage of subjects with HCV on-treatment virologic failure, and the percentage of subjects with HCV virologic relapse.
5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 3b, open-label, non-randomi zed, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of ABT-493/ABT-530 in combination with SOF and RBV in HCV GT1 –
6-infected subjects, including subjects with compensated cirrhosis and/or HIV-1 coinfection, who have experienced virologic failure while participating in an AbbVie HCV parent study.  
It is anticipated that approximately 50 HCV infected subjects who have experienced 
virologic failure following treatment with ABT-493/ABT-530 or 3D or 2D regimens in one of the AbbVie HCV parent studies will be enrolled. Besides meeting the eligibility 
criteria (Section 5.2), additional subject eligibility to enroll in Study M15-942 will be 
evaluated at the discretion of AbbVie based upon the characteristics of subject's HCV infection, prior treatment history, and the evolving data from on-going clinical studies.
A study schematic (Treatment Period) is shown below in Figure 1 .

5.1.1 Screening
At the Screening Visit, subjects who provide written (signed and dated) informed consent 
prior to any study specific procedures will receive a unique subject number via the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system.
The investigator will evaluate whether the subject meets all of the eligibility criteria 
specified in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 during the period from the Screening Visit 
through Study Day 1 prior to dosing and record the results of this assessment and the details of the informed consent process in the subject's medical records.  Eligible subjects have up to 42 days following the Screening Visit to enroll into the study.
5.1.1.1 Rescreening
Subjects who test positive at Screening for any of the following parameters are not 
eligible to rescreen:
●Positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg);
●A positive HIV-2 test;
●A positive serum pregnancy test (if female).
In addition, subjects who develop decompensated liver disease, including ascites noted on physical exam, hepatic encephalopathy or esophageal variceal bleeding during the screening period will not be eligible for rescreening.
Otherwise, subjects may be retested/rescr eened only once without approval of the AbbVie 
Therapeutic Area Scientific Director (TA SD)/TA MD, as follows:
●Subjects who have exclusionary laborat ory parameter(s) are allowed to retest 
within the screening period on the related panel(s) (e.g., exclusionary ALT 
requires a repeat chemistry panel) within  the same screening period and must 
meet all eligibility laboratory criteria on any panel that is repeated.  If the retest 
result(s) are also exclusionary, the s ubject may not be rescreened or retested 
again.
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
38
●Subjects who fail to enroll within 42 days of Screening, regardless of the 
reason for falling outside the 42-day screening window, may rescreen only 
once and must be rescreened for all eligibility criteria (except those noted below), not just those that were exclusionary.
Subjects may rescreen once for any other reason, with approval of the AbbVie TA SD/TA 
MD.
Subjects being rescreened do not need to be retested for HBsAg, HIV-2 Ab, HCV 
genotype and subtype, and FibroScan/liver biopsy.
5.1.2 Treatment Period
Prior to the Study Day 1 visit, after all eligibility criteria have been confirmed, subjects 
will be allocated via IRT into one of two treatment arms based on their HCV genotype, cirrhotic status, and prior treatment experience with PI- and/or NS5Ai-containing regimens before experiencing virologic failure in an AbbVie HCV parent study.  Subjects 
will be administered study drugs at the site on Study Day 1, and provided with dosing instructions.
Study visits during the Treatment Period are detailed in Appendix C .  Safety and 
tolerability will be assessed throughout th e study.  Laboratory testing will include 
chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis as specified in Table 10 .  Plasma samples for 
pharmacokinetic analysis and HCV RNA an alysis will be collected as detailed in 
Section 5.3.1.1 and Section 5.3.3.1 , respectively.  Blood samples for optional 
pharmacogenetic analysis will be collected as detailed in Appendix C .
All subjects will continue to return to the site on an outpatient basis as outlined in 
Appendix C .  Sites should ensure that subjects adhere to all the study visits.  Subjects who 
cannot complete their study visit per the visit schedule should ensure that they do not run out of study drug prior to their next study vis it.  Compliance is critical to ensure adequate 
drug exposure.

39
Some of the Treatment Period study visits and visit activities (including but not limited to 
vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and concomitant medication assessment) may be 
conducted in the home or non-hospital/clinic environment by qualified individuals at the request of the investigator and with the agreement of the subject.
Virologic failure criteria will be evaluated a nd applied by the investigator as detailed in 
Section 5.4.1.1 .  Subjects meeting on-treatment virolog ic failure (OTVF) criteria will be 
discontinued from study drugs.Subjects who discontinue from the study drugs during the Treatment Period regardless of 
the reason for discontinuation should return for a Treatment Discontinuation Visit andundergo the study procedures as outlined in Appendix C and as described in Section 5.4.1 .
Subjects who take at least one dose of study  drug and complete or discontinue treatment 
will enter the Post-Treatment Period as detailed in Section 5.1.3 .
5.1.3 Post-Treatment Period
All subjects who received at least one dose of study drug and either complete or discontinue treatment will be monitored for an additional 24 weeks following the last dose 
of study drug for safety, HCV RNA and the emergence, persistence of resistance-
associated viral variants, and – for HCV/HIV-1 coinfected subjects – plasma HIV-1 RNA and HIV drug resistance.
The Post-Treatment Period will begin the day following the last dose of study drug 
treatment.  Study visits during the Post-Treatment Period are detailed in Appendix C and 
Section 5.3.1.1 .
Some of the Post-Treatment Period study visits and visit activities (including but not 
limited to vital signs, clinical laboratory tes ts, concomitant medication assessment) may 
be conducted in the home or non-hospital/clinic environment at the request of the investigator and with the agreement of the subject.

Rationale for Inclusion Criteria
1, 2, 8 – 11 In order to select the appropriate subject population with appropriate 
disease characteristics for evaluation
3 – 5 RBV has known teratogenic effects.  The impact of ABT-493 and 
ABT-530 on human pregnancies has not been established.  However, 
assessment of the completed nonclinical reproductive toxicology studies indicates that there is no drug-related effect on 
teratogenicity/fetotoxicity.  In addition, the compounds are non-
genotoxic.  No adequate human data are available to establish whether or not sofosbuvir poses a risk to pregnancy outcomes.  In animal 
reproduction studies, no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes 
was observed with the components of sofosbuvir at exposures greater 
than those in humans at the recommended human dose

5.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Use of medications/supplements (including prescription or over-the-counter, vitamins 
and/or herbal supplements) or vaccines from the time of signing the informed consent through the Treatment Period and 30 days after study drugs are stopped, must be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) at each study visit indicated in the Treatment Period (Appendix C ) along with the reason for use, date(s) of administration including 
start and end dates, and dosage information including dose, route and frequency.  The investigator should review all concomitant medications for any potential interactions.
During the Post-Treatment Pe riod, all medicati ons taken will be recorded until 30 days 
following the last dose of study drugs.  After 30 days post-treatment, during the 
Post-Treatment Period, only antiviral therapies related to the treatment of HCV and/or 
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
47
HIV and medications prescribed in association with a serious adverse event (SAE) will be 
recorded in EDC.
The AbbVie TA SD/TA MD should be contacted if there are any questions regarding 
concomitant or prior therapies.
5.2.3.1 Prior HCV Therapy
The HCV drug treatment regimen and its duration given as a part of the subject's 
participation in an AbbVie HCV parent study, as well as all other past HCV treatment regimens and their durations received by the subject, will be recorded in the eCRF.
5.2.3.2 Prior and Concomitant HIV-1 Therapy
If a subject is on an HIV-1 ART regimen, it must include at least one of the ARV agents 
defined on Inclusion Criterion 10 (Section 5.2.1 ).
Subjects will maintain the same dose and dosing interval of their HIV-1 ART regimen upon initiating the study drugs regimen.
Subjects must remain on the same HIV-1 ART regimen for the entire Treatment Period.  
Any change to an allowed HIV-1 ART regimen during the Treatment Period must be 
discussed with the AbbVie TA SD/TA MD prior to the change, unless the change is being made to address an immediate safety concern.
Subjects receiving any other HIV-1 ART in addition to those listed in Inclusion 
Criterion 10 (Section 5.2.1 ) would not be eligible for enrollment in the study.
5.2.3.3 Other Concomitant Therapy
Subjects should be on a stable dose of concomitant medications for at least 14 days prior 
to initiation of study drugs.  The investigator should confirm that a concomitant medication/supplement can be safely administer ed with study drugs.  Some medications 
may require dose adjustments due to the potential for drug-drug interactions.
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
48
During the Post-Treatment Period, investigators should reassess concomitant 
medications/supplements and subjects may resume previously prohibited medications/supplements or revert to pre-study doses, up to 14 days following discontinuation of study drugs, if applicable.
Flu shots and all essential vaccinations are allowed during Screening through the Post-
Treatment Period for all subjects.  Flu shots and vaccinations may affect plasma HIV-1 
RNA levels.
5.2.3.4 Prohibited Therapy
Medications or supplements prohibited to be administered with ABT-493/ABT-530 are 
listed in Table 9 .  For subjects in the study in  countries where ABT-493/ABT-530 
(glecapravir/pibrentasvir) has received marketing authorization, any medications in the local label that are contraindicated to be administered with ABT-493/ABT-530 (glecapravir/pibrentasvir) are also considered to be prohibited medications.  Subjects must be able to safely disconti nue any prohibited medications or supplements at least 14 days 
or 10 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of any study drug and not use these during the entire Treatment Period and for 14 days following discontinuation of

5.3 Efficacy, Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacogenetic and Safety 
Assessments/Variables
5.3.1 Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed and Flow 
Chart
Study procedures described are listed in the following section of this protocol and are 
summarized in tabular format in Appendix C .
5.3.1.1 Study Procedures
Informed Consent and RBV Information
Signed study-specific informed consent will be obtained from the subject before any study 
procedures are performed.  All subjects will be given the RBV Medication Guide (where applicable/locally available).  Male subjects will be given an additional copy of the RBV Medication Guide (where applicable/locally available) to share with their female partner(s) (where applicable/locally available).  Details about how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3.
Medical History
The subject's medical history including history of tobacco, alcohol use and drug use, 
recorded in the AbbVie HCV parent study, will be updated at the Screening Visit with any relevant information that was not collected in the previous AbbVie study and any new medical history that occurred between the end of the previous AbbVie study and this study.  In some cases, the medical history recorded in the previous AbbVie study will be electronically transferred in to the eCRFs in this study and in other cases it will need to be 
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
53
manually entered into the eCRFs by the site due to differences between the medical 
history eCRFs for the previous AbbVie study and the current study.  The subject's medical history will also be updated, as needed, at the Study Day 1 Visit.  This updated medical 
history will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.
Physical Examination
A complete physical examination will be performed at visits specified in Appendix C , or 
upon subject discontinuation.  A symptom-directed physical examination may be 
performed at any other visit, when necessary.
The physical examination performed on Study Da y 1 will serve as the baseline physical 
examination for clinical assessment.  Any significant physical examination findings after 
the first dose will be recorded as adverse events.Height will be measured only at Screening.
Vital Signs and Weight
Body temperature, blood pressure, waist circumference, pulse and body weight will be 
measured at each study visit as specified in Appendix C or upon subject discontinuation.  
Blood pressure and pulse rate should be measured after the subject has been sitting for at least 3 minutes and prior to blood collection.  The subject will wear lightweight clothing and no shoes during weighing.
Pregnancy Testing
A serum and urine pregnancy test will be performed for all female subjects of 
childbearing potential at Screening and Day 1.  Additional urine pregnancy tests will be performed every 4 weeks, starting at Day 1 (prior to enrollment) during the treatment period, including at the last treatment period vis it and until 4 months after the last study 
drug dose (or as directed by local RBV label, whichever is more restrictive), as indicated in Appendix C .  Determination of postmenopausal status will be made during the 
Screening period, based on the subject's history.
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
54
Females of non-childbearing potential (either postmenopausal or permanently surgically 
sterile as defined above) at Screening do not require pregnancy testing.
12-Lead Electrocardiogram
A 12-lead resting ECG will be obtained at Screening.  The ECG should be performed 
prior to blood collection.
The ECGs will be evaluated by an appropri ately trained physician at the site ("local 
reader").  The local reader from the site will sign and date all ECG tracings and will 
provide his/her global interpretation as a written comment on the tracing using the 
following categories:
●Normal ECG
●Abnormal ECG – not clinically significant
●Abnormal ECG – clin ically significant
Only the local reader's evaluation of the ECG will be collected and documented in the subject's source.  The automatic machine r eading (i.e., machine-generated measurements 
and interpretation that are automatically printed on the ECG tracing) will not be collected.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Samples will be obtained at a minimum for the clinical laboratory tests outlined in 
Table 10 at the visits indicated in Appendix C .
Blood samples for serum chemistry tests should be collected following a minimum 8-hour 
fast (with the exception of the Screening Visit, which may be non-fasting).  Subjects whose visits occur prior to the morning dose of study drug should be instructed to fast after midnight.  Subjects whose visits occur following the morning dose of study drug should be instructed to fast after breakfast un til the study visit occurs.  At the Study Day 1 
visit, a fasting blood sample should be collected prior to the first dose of study drug.  Blood samples should still be drawn if the s ubject did not fast for at least 8 hours.  Fasting 
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
55
or non-fasting status will be recorded in the source documents and on the laboratory 
requisition.  The baseline laboratory test results for clinical assessment for a particular test will be defined as the last measurement prior to the initial dose of study drug.
A central laboratory will be utilized to process and provide results for the clinical 
laboratory tests.
Instructions regarding the collection, processing, and shipping of these samples will be 
provided by th e central laboratory chosen for this study.  The certified laboratory chosen 
for this study is Covance.  Samples will be sent to the following addresses:

For any laboratory test value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to 
be clinically significant:
●The investigator will repeat the test to verify the out-of-range value.
●The investigator will follow the out-of- range value to a satisfactory clinical 
resolution.
●A laboratory test value that requires a subject to be discontinued from the 
study or requires a subject to receive treatment will be recorded as an adverse 
event.
The management of laboratory abnormalities th at may occur during the study is described 
in Section 6.1.7 .
Hepatitis B and HIV Screen
HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) and anti -HIV Ab will be performed at Screening.  
The investigator must discuss any local reporting requirements to local health agencies 
with the subject.  The site will report these results per local regulations, if necessary.  The HBsAg results will be reported by the central laboratory to the clinical database.
Liver Diagnostic Testing
Subjects categorized as cirrhotic in the AbbVie HCV parent studies will be categorized 
as being cirrhotic in this study.
Subjects categorized as non-cirrhotic in the AbbVie HCV parent studies, who do not 
have a qualifying liver biopsy showing absence of cirrhosis within the previous 12 months 
from Screening or qualifying FibroScan showing absence of cirrhosis with the previous 6 months from Screening, but who otherwise meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of 
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
58
the exclusion criteria will undergo liver bi opsy or non-invasive testing (FibroTest/APRI 
or FibroScan) prior to enrollment.  Selection of liver biopsy or non-invasive testing 
performed should be based on local standard practice.
Subjects must be documented as  non-cirrhotic or cirrhotic defined as meeting one of the 
following criteria: 
Non-Cirrhotic
A liver biopsy within 12 months prior to or during Screening demonstrating the 
absence of cirrhosis, e.g., a METAVIR, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, IASL, Scheuer, or Laennec fibrosis score of ≤ 3, Ishak fibrosis score of ≤  4; or
A FibroScan
®score of < 12.5 kPa within ≤ 6 months of Screening or during Screening 
period (FibroScan®must be approved by the local regulatory agency to qualify for 
entrance criteria); or
A Screening FibroTest score of ≤ 0.48 and Aspartate Aminotransferase to Platelet 
Ratio Index (APRI) < 1.
Cirrhotic
Previous histologic diagnosis of cirrhosis on liver biopsy, e.g., METAVIR, Batts-
Ludwig, Knodell, IASL, Scheuer, or Laennec fibrosis score of > 3, Ishak score of > 4 or on a liver biopsy conducted during Screening; or
A FibroScan
®score of ≥ 12.5 kPa at any time prior to Screening or during Screening 
period (FibroScan®must be approved by the local regulatory agency); or
A Screening FibroTest result that is ≥ 0.75 and an APRI > 2.
In the absence of a definitive diagnosis of presence or absence of cirrhosis by 
FibroTest/APRI using the above criteria (indeterminate FibroTest [0.48 < result < 0.75], or conflicting FibroTest and APRI results [e.g., FibroTest ≤ 0.48, but APRI

M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
59
≥1]), a liver biopsy or FibroScan®is required.  Liver biopsy results will supersede 
Fibrotest/APRI or FibroScan®results and be considered definitive.
Subjects who are categorized as cirrhotic in this study according to the criteria above 
must also meet Inclusion Criteria 8 and 9.
When performed within the specified timeframes, the result of the liver biopsy 
supersedes the results of FibroScan and FibroTest/APRI and result of FibroScan 
supersedes the results of FibroTest/APRI.
Child-Pugh (Child-Turcotte-Pugh) Score and Category
The Child-Pugh (Child-Turcotte-Pugh) score uses five clinical measures of liver disease (3 laboratory parameters and 2 clinical assessments) as shown in Table 11 .  Child-Pugh 
score will be determined only for subjects with compensated cirrhosis at the visits indicated in Appendix C .

Clinical Assessment of Hepatic Decompensation
A clinical assessment of hepatic encephalopathy and ascites will be performed only for 
subjects with compensated cirrhosis at Study Day 1 prior to dosing to confirm the subject 
has not progressed to hepatic decompensation since screening.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Screening:  Liver Ultrasound
HCC screening will be required as a protocol-specified study procedure only at the 
Screening Study Visit and at the last Post -treatment Study Visit, as indicated in 
Appendix C , for subjects with compensated cirrhos is only.  Between those visits, HCC 
screening should be performed according to standard of care.
At the Screening Study Visit and at the last  Post-treatment Study Visit, subjects with 
compensated cirrhosis will be required to perform a liver ultrasound to screen for HCC, 
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
61
unless the subject has a historical liver ultrasound, CT or MRI performed for HCC 
screening within 3 months prior to those vis its, in which case the result of the historical 
US, CT or MRI will be used as the result for that Study Visit assessment.  A positive 
ultrasound result suspicious of HCC will be confirmed with CT scan or MRI.  Alternate methods of screening for HCC (i.e., MRI or CT) at a study visit should be discussed with the TA MD.
Enrollment and Assignment of Subject Numbers
All screening activities must be completed and reviewed prior to enrollment.  Subjects 
who meet the eligibility criteria will proceed to enrollment via the IRT system on Day 1 
(Treatment Period).  Subject numbers will be unique 5-digit numbers starting with 10001.  
The first 3 digits will represent the investigative site and the last 2 digits will represent the 
subjects screened at that site.  Enrolled subjects will keep their subject number throughout the study.
Study Drug Compliance for Kits
Bottles of ABT-493/ABT-530, SOF and RBV will be provided for subject dosing to the 
site.  Each subject will have compliance documented by the site in the subject's source notes for ABT-493/ABT-530, SOF and RBV.  At each drug accountability visit in Appendix C , the overall number of tablets of ABT-493/ABT-530, SOF and RBV 
remaining in each bottle will be recorded in the source and transferred to the IRT system along with the date of reconciliation.
HCV Genotype and Subtype
Plasma samples for HCV genotype and subtype  will be collected at Screening.  Genotype 
and subtype will be assessed using the Versant®HCV Genotype Inno LiPA Assay, 
Version 2.0 or higher (LiPA; Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY).  If the 
LiPA assay is unable to genotype/subtype  a sample, its genotype/subtype will be 
determined by a Sanger sequencing assay of a region of the NS5B gene (Covance).

HCV RNA Levels
Plasma samples for HCV RNA levels will be collected as indicated in Appendix C .  
Plasma HCV RNA levels will be determined for each sample collected by the central 
laboratory using the COBAS®AmpliPrep/COBAS®TaqMan HCV Quantitative Test, 
v2.0.  For this assay, the lower limit of detection (LLOD) and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) are both 15 IU/mL.
HCV Resistance Testing Sample
A plasma sample for HCV resistance testing will be collected prior to dosing on Day 1 
and at the study visits indicated in Appendix C .  Specific instructions for preparation and 
storage of HCV RNA and HCV resistance samples will be provided by the central laboratory, AbbVie, or its designee.
Archive Serum and Plasma Sample
Archive serum and plasma samples will be collected at the study visits, indicated in 
Appendix C .  Archive serum and plasma samples are being collected for possible 
additional analyses, including but not limited to, study drug or metabolite measurements, 
HCV RNA levels, safety/efficacy assessments, HCV gene sequencing, HCV resistance testing, biomarkers of inflammation or fibrosis, and other possible predictors of response including biomarker for other causes of liver diseases, as determined by AbbVie.
Specific instructions for preparation and storage of archive samples will be provided by 
the central laboratory, AbbVie, or its designee.

cards to record the exact date, time (record to the nearest minute) and number of tablets of study drug administration (ABT-493/ABT-530, SOF, and RBV) for the last 2 doses of each study drug taken prior to the scheduled pharmacokinetic sample co llection during the 
Treatment Period.
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
63
The site staff will record the information about the last 2 doses taken prior to the 
scheduled pharmacokinetic sample collection from the study drug dosing card into the eCRF.  In the event that the dosing card is not available, the site may obtain dosing information via patient interview and record this information in the source notes.
To facilitate proper dosing of study drug before pharmacokinetic evaluation blood 
samples are taken, the following procedures should be performed:
●The study coordinator should make sure the subject is given the dosing card at 
the visits listed in Appendix C .
●The Investigator or designee will contact the subject approximately 2 days before the scheduled visit date to review the importance of proper study drug
administration relative to the pharmacokinetic blood collection and documentation of dosing times on the dos ing card.  The date and time of the 
contact will be entered into the subject's source documents.
●The completed dosing card will be collected by the Investigator or designee on the day of the visit and be kept as a source record of dosage administration times documented in the eCRF.
Flow Cytometry, HIV RNA and HIV Resistance Testing Samples
For subjects with HCV/HIV-1 coinfection, samples for plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and 
flow cytometry (including but not limited to CD4+ T- cell and CD8+ T- cell counts 
[absolute and percent]) will be obtained at the times specified in Appendix C .  Plasma 
HIV-1 RNA will be measured by the central laboratory using the Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test, version 2.0 HIV-1 Assay.  Results below the LLOD are reported as:  "Not Detected."  Sub jects will also have bl ood samples drawn and 
archived at the study visits indicated in Appendix C .  These samples may be used for 
other analyses including drug resistance testing.  These samples may be tested at the discretion of AbbVie.
If a HIV-1 RNA level result of a subject on stable HIV-1 ART is ≥ 200 copies/mL, the 
subject's HIV-1 RNA is to be repeated as noted in Section 5.4.1.2 .  At the time the repeat 
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
64
plasma HIV-1 RNA is drawn, a sample should be obtained for HIV-1 genotypic resistance 
testing.  If the subject's repeat HIV-1 RNA is ≥ 500 copies/mL, the sample obtained for 
HIV-1 genotypic resistance testing will be analyzed.
HIV-1 protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN) sequences, as 
applicable, will be analyzed by Monogram Biosciences using the GenoSure®Prime drug 
resistance assay.
If the subject's repeat HIV-1 RNA is < 200 copies/mL, then the subject will resume 
routine plasma HIV-1 RNA assessments as shown in Appendix C , and described in 
Section 5.4.1.1 .
Specific instructions for preparation and storage of flow cytometry, plasma HIV-1 RNA, archive and HIV resistance samples will be provided by the central laboratory, AbbVie, or 
its designee.

Department at AbbVie.  Plasma concentrati ons of possible metabolites of any analytes 
listed above may also be determined using either validated or non-validated methods.
5.3.3 Efficacy Variables
Virologic response will be assessed by plasma HCV RNA levels in IU/mL at various time 
points from Day 1 through 24 weeks after completion of treatment.
5.3.3.1 Primary Variable
The primary efficacy variable is SVR
12(HCV RNA < LLOQ 12 weeks after the last 
actual dose of study drug) in each treatment arm, and overall.
5.3.3.2 Secondary Variables
The secondary efficacy variables are:
●The percentage of subjects with HCV on-treatment virologic failure in each 
treatment arm and overall.
●The percentage of subjects with HCV virologic relapse in each treatment arm and overall.
5.3.4 Resistance Variables

acid positions at baseline identified by next generation sequencing (NGS) will be 
compared to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence.
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
67
The following resistance information will be analyzed for subjects receiving study drugs 
who do not achieve SVR 12and who have a post-baseline sample with HCV RNA 
≥1000 IU/mL:  1) the amino acid variants in ava ilable post-baseline samples identified by 
NGS and comparison to the baseline sequence, 2) the amino acid variants in available post-baseline samples at signature resistance associated positions identified by NGS and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence, and 3) the persistence of viral resistance by NGS.
5.3.5 Safety Variables
The following safety evaluations will be performed during the study:  adverse events, vital 
signs, physical examination, and laboratory tests assessments.
5.3.6 Pharmacokinetic Variable
Individual plasma concentrations of ABT-493, ABT-530, SOF, primary metabolite of 
SOF (GS-331007), and RBV will be tabulated and summarized.  Additional parameters may be calculated if useful in the interpretation of the data.
5.3.7 Pharmacogenetic Exploratory Research Variables
Optional pharmacogenetic samples may be collected to conduct exploratory investigations 
into known and novel biomarkers.  The types of biomarkers to be analyzed may include, but are not limited to, nucleic acids, proteins, lip ids or metabolites.  The samples may be 
analyzed as part of a multi-study assessment of factors influencing the subjects' response to the study drug (or drugs of the same or similar class) or the development and progression of the subjects' disease or related conditions.  The samples may also be used 
to develop new diagnostic tests, therapies, research methods or technologies.  The results from these analyses are exploratory in nature and may not be included with the study report.

5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
Each subject has the right to withdraw from the study at any time.  In addition, the 
investigator may discontinue a subject from the study at any time if the investigator considers it necessary for any reason, including the occurrence of an adverse event or noncompliance with the protocol.
If, during the course of study drug administration, the subject prematurely discontinues 
(D/C), the procedures outlined for the applicable Premature D/C Visit should be completed as defined in Appendix C .  Ideally this should occur on the day of study drug 
discontinuation, but no later than 2 days af ter their final dose of study drug and prior to 
the initiation of any other anti-HCV therapy.  However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject's condition.  Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the investigator's best clinical judgment.  The last dose of any study drug and reason for discontinuation will be recorded in the EDC (electronic data cap ture) system.  The subject should then begin the Post-
Treatment Period where the subject will be monitored for 24 weeks for HCV RNA, the emergence and persistence of resistant viral variants.
If a subject is discontinued from study drugs or during the Post-Treatment Period with an 
ongoing adverse event or an unresolved laboratory result that is significantly outside of the reference range, the investigator will attempt to provide follow-up until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the laboratory re sult or adverse event is achieved.
In the event that a positive result is obtained on a pregnancy test for a subject or a subject reports becoming pregnant during the Treatment Period, the administration of RBV (if applicable) to that subject must be discontinued immediately.  DAAs may be continued at the Principal Investigator's discretion after discussion with the subject, if the benefit of continuing DAAs is considered to outweigh the risk.  Specific instructions regarding subject pregnancy can be found in Section 6.1.6 .  Subjects will be monitored for SVR in 
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
69
the Post-Treatment Period as described in Section 5.1.3 .  The investigator is also 
encouraged to report the pregnancy information to the voluntary RBV Pregnancy 
Registry.
5.4.1.1 HCV Virologic Failure Criteria
The following criteria will be considered evidence of OTVF, for the purposes of subject 
management, leading to discontinuation of study drug: 
●Confirmed increase from nadir in HCV RNA (defined as 2 consecutive HCV
RNA measurement of > 1 log10 IU/mL above nadir) at any time point during study drug treatment; or
●Confirmed HCV RNA ≥ 100 IU/mL (defined as 2 consecutive HCV RNA 
measurements ≥ 100 IU/mL) after HCV RNA < LLOQ during study drug 
treatment.
Confirmatory testing should be completed as soon as possible and the subject should 
remain on study drug treatment until the OTVF criterion has been confirmed.  Subjects 
with confirmed OTVF will be discontinued from study drug and will continue to be followed in the Post-Treatment Period for the emergence and persistence of resistant viral substitutions until 24 weeks post-treatment ( Appendix C ).
Post-treatment relapse is defined as confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ (defined as 
2 consecutive HCV RNA measurements ≥ LLOQ) at any post-treatment visit, for subjects 
who completed treatment (defined as study drug duration ≥ 77 days for subjects who 
received 12 weeks or ≥ 103 days for subjects who received 16 weeks) and had HCV RNA 
< LLOQ at the final treatment visit, excluding cases of reinfection, as defined below.  HCV reinfection is defined as confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after the end of treatment in 
a subject who had HCV RNA < LLOQ at Final Treatment Visit, along with the post-treatment detection of a different HCV genot ype, subtype, or clade compared with 
baseline, as determined by phylogenetic analysis performed by the sponsor of the HCV NS3, NS5A, and/or NS5B gene sequences.  Reinfection in the case of the same HCV subtype is defined as a clade switch, as indicated by the lack of clustering between the 
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
70
baseline and post-treatment sequences by phyloge netic analysis.  If phylogenetic analysis 
is not possible due to technical difficulties, HCV reinfection may be determined with a 
confirmed HCV genotype or subtype switch by the Versant HCV Genotype Inno-LiPA Assay v2.0 or Sanger assay.
5.4.1.2 Failure to Maintain HIV Virologic Suppression
HIV-1 RNA will be assessed at each scheduled study visit during the Treatment and 
Post-Treatment Period, as detailed in Appendix C .
The criteria for failure to maintain HIV virologic suppression among subjects on stable ARTs is as follows:
●HIV-1 RNA ≥ 200 copies/mL confirmed on 2 consecutive tests at least 
2 weeks apart, in a subject compliant with their HIV ARV therapy
At the time a confirmatory HIV-1 RNA is drawn, a sample for HIV-1 genotypic resistance testing should also be obtained; this sample will be analyzed if the subject's repeat plasma HIV-1 RNA is ≥ 500 copies/mL.  Subjects should remain on HCV study drug treatment 
and his/her current ART regimen while the failure to maintain HIV virologic suppression is being confirmed.  A confirmatory HIV-1 RNA and HIV-1 genotypic resistance blood draw can be done as an unscheduled visit.  However, if this blood draw falls on the date of a scheduled study visit ( Appendix C ), only a single HIV-1 RNA and HIV-1 genotypic 
resistance blood draw needs to be performed at this visit.
During the Treatment Period, subjects with confirmed failure to maintain HIV-1 RNA 
suppression should con tinue HCV study drug treatment unless there is a requirement for 
prohibited concomitant medications (Section 5.2.3.2 ) to construct a new HIV ART 
regimen.
Clinical management of failure to maintain HIV virologic suppression during the study 
(Treatment and Post-Treatment Period) will be handled by the Investigator according to current HIV treatment guidelines and local standard of care.
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
71
If the investigator wishes to change the HIV-1 ART regimen for a subject, it must be 
discussed with the AbbVie TA MD prior to the change being made, unless the change is 
being made to address an immediate safety concern.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, ei ther in its entirety or at any study site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination.  The investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination.  Advance notice is not required by either party if the study is stopped due to safety concerns.  If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will immediately notify the investigator by telephone and subsequently provide written instructions for study termination.
5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Treatments Administered
Each dose of study drug (ABT-493/ABT-530, SOF, and RBV) will be dispensed in the 
form of tablets at the visits listed in Appendix C .  The date and time of dosing will be 
recorded to the nearest minute in the source documents (or study drug dosing card) and the eCRF for the 2 days immediately prior to each st udy visit starting prior to the Week 2 
visit.
AbbVie will provide ABT-493/ABT-530 as 100 mg/40 mg film-coated tablets.  
ABT-493/ABT-530 will be taken orally as three tablets QD (total daily dose of 300 mg/120 mg) and with food.
AbbVie will provide SOF as 400 mg tablets.  SOF will be taken orally as 1 tablet QD, 
with food.
AbbVie will provide RBV as 200 mg tablets.  RBV dosing is determined based on the age

ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
72
with food.  The RBV dose established at Day 1 should be maintained throughout the 
entire treatment, regardless of ulterior changes in age or weight, unless a dose 
modification is needed due to toxicity (see Section 6.1.7).
Study drug must not be dispensed without contacting the IRT system.  Study drug may 
only be dispensed to subjects enrolled in the study through the IRT system.  At the end of the Treatment Period or at the Premature D/C Visit from the Treatment Period, the site will contact the IRT system to provide vi sit date information and study drug return 
information for each kit (Section 5.5.7 ).
In the event that there is an issue with the study drug supply during the Treatment Period, commercial drug may be provided only with prior AbbVie approval, so that the subject does not experience treatment interruptions.  If commercial drug is provided, AbbVie will provide instructions for documentation.

5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
At the Screening Visit, all subjects will be assigned a unique subject number through the 
use of IRT.  For subjects who do not meet the study selection criteria, the site personnel must contact the IRT system and identify the subject as a screen failure.
Subjects who are enrolled will retain their subject number, assigned at the Screening Visit, 
throughout the study.  Subjects will be allocated to one of two arms based on their HCV genotype (1 to 6), cirrhosis status (presence/ab sence), and prior treatment experience with 
PI- and/or NS5Ai-containing regimens before experiencing virologic failure in an AbbVie HCV parent study.  For enrollment of eligible subjects into the study, the site will utilize 
the IRT system in order to receive a unique study drug kit numbers.  The study drug kit 
numbers will be assigned according to schedules computer-generated before the start of the study by the AbbVie Statistics Departmen t.  Upon receipt of study drug, the site will 
acknowledge receipt in the IRT system.
Contact information and user guidelines for IRT use will be provided to each site.
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
74
Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria will  be enrolled as described in Section 8.3.
5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Selection of the doses for this study is discussed in Section 5.6.4 .  Study drug dosing will 
be initiated at the Study Day 1 Visit.
ABT-493/ABT-530 (3 tablets) will be dosed QD with food.SOF (1 tablet) will be dosed QD, at the same time as ABT-493/ABT-530.RBV (3 to 6 tablets based on age and weight of the subject at Day 1) will be dosed twice 
daily with food.  For example, if a subject takes 5 tablets of RBV per day, 2 tablets should be taken in the morning, and 3 tablets should be taken in the evening.  One of the two daily RBV doses will be taken at the same time as ABT-493/ABT-530 and SOF.  The other RBV dose should be taken approximately 12 hours apart.
The timing of study drugs administration should be kept consistent during the treatment 
period.
5.5.5 Blinding
This is an open-label study.5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will 
administer/dispense study drug only to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with the protocol.  The study drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the protocol.
At the start of the study, each subject should receive counseling regarding the importance 
of dosing adherence with the treatment regimen with regard to virologic response and potential development of resistance.
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
75
At each study visit after Day 1 during the Tr eatment Period, subjects will be instructed to 
bring all bottles of study drug (full, partial or empty) for assessment of treatment 
compliance.  At post-baseline dispensing visits denoted in Appendix C , study site 
personnel will assess subject compliance by inspecting the contents of the bottles and record the status of each one, as well as the exact number of remaining tablets of ABT-493/ABT-530, SOF and RBV in IRT.  Treatment compliance will be based on the number of tablets dispensed, as recorded in IRT, and the number of remaining tablets.  If poor compliance is noted, the subject should be counseled and this should be documented in the subject's source.
5.5.7 Drug Accountability
The investigator or his/her representative will verify that study drug supplies are received 
intact and in the correct amounts.  This will be documented by signing and dating the Proof of Receipt (POR) or similar document and via recording in the IRT system.  A current (running) and accurate inventory of study drug will be kept by the investigator and will include lot number, POR number, number of tablets dispensed, subject number, initials of person who dispensed study drug and date dispensed for each subject.  An overall accountability of the study drug will be performed and verified by the AbbVie monitor throughout the Treatment Period.  The monitor will review study drug accountability on an ongoing basis.  Final accoun tability will be verified by the monitor at 
the end of study drug treatment at the site.
During the study, should an enrolled subject  misplace or damage a study drug bottle of 
ABT-493/ABT-530, SOF, or RBV, the IRT system must be contacted and informed of the 
misplaced or damaged study drug.  If the bottle is damaged, the subject will be requested to return the remaining study drug to th e site.  Replacement st udy drug may only be 
dispensed to the subject by contacting the IRT system.  Study drug replacement(s) and an explanation of the reason for the misplaced or damaged study drug(s) will be documented within the IRT system.  Study drug start dates for each drug and the last dose of the regimen will be documented in the subject's source documents and recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  The status of each bottle, number of tablets remaining in each bottle 
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
76
returned, and the date of reconciliation will be documented in the IRT system.  The 
monitor will review study drug accountability on an ongoing basis.
Upon completion of or discontinuation from the Treatment Period, all original study drug 
bottles (containing unused study drugs) will be returned to AbbVie (or designee) or destroyed on site.  All destruction procedure s will be according to instructions from the 
Sponsor and according to local regulations following completion of  drug accountability 
procedures.  The number of tablets of each type of study drug returned in each bottle will be noted in the IRT system or on a drug accountability log (if appropriate).  Labels must 
remain attached to the containers.
5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study exploring the efficacy and safety 
of the combination regimen of ABT-493/ABT-530 plus SOF and RBV in subjects with chronic HCV GT1 – 6 infection who experienced virologic failure in HCV treatment in an AbbVie HCV parent study.
The primary effi cacy is m easured by the percentage of patients achieving SVR
12in each 
treatment arm.  The study design will provi de additional data on ABT-493/ABT-530 in 
combination with SOF and RBV, such as response rates in subjects infected with different 
HCV genotypes, with or without cirrhosis, the PI and/or NS5Ai treatment experience prior to the AbbVie HCV parent study pharmacokinetics, resistance, and the nature of virologic failure (e.g., OTVF or post-treatment relapse).
No control group is included in this study.  This study does not aim to establish non-
inferiority or superiority to the standards of care, thus a comparator arm is not needed.  
5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard pharmacokinetic, statistical, clinical, and laboratory procedures will be utilized 
in this study.  HCV RNA assays are standard and validated.

5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population
This study will enroll subjects infected with chronic HCV GT1 – 6 who experienced 
virologic failure following treatment with ABT-493/ABT-530, 3D or 2D regimens in an AbbVie HCV parent study, in order to assess the efficacy, safety of ABT-493/ABT-530 plus SOF and RBV as a retreatment regimen.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
5.6.4.1 Rationale for Dose Selections
HCV infected patients who were treated and experienced virologic failure in an AbbVie 
HCV parent study, will be treated with ABT-493/ABT-530 300 mg/120 mg in 
combination with SOF 400 mg and weight-based RBV for 12 or 16 weeks in the current protocol.  The dose of 300 mg/120 mg of ABT-493/ABT-530 was selected based on 
multiple HCV clinical trials including Studies M14-867, M14-868 and M15-410 in order to optimize efficacy of the combination while maintaining an acceptable safety profile, is consistent with the dose used in AbbVie HC V Phase 3 studies and is the approved dose 
for commercial use.
In Studies M14-867 and M14-868, high SVR rates have been achieved for the 
combination of ABT-493 300 mg and ABT-530 120 mg ( Table 6 ).  All subjects (N = 147) 
with HCV GT1, GT2, GT4, GT5 and GT6 infection have achieved SVR
12, following 8 or 
12 weeks of treatment and a high SVR 12rate of 96% has been achieved for GT3 infected 
subjects (107/111).  In Study M15-410 Part 1, 21 out of 22 subjects (95%) who were previous DAA-experienced and treated with the ABT-493 300 mg and ABT-530 120 mg combination therapy in the study have achieved SVR
12.  
ABT-493 and ABT-530 regimens including the ABT-493/ABT-530 300 mg/120 mg QD 
regimen used in the current study have been well-tolerated and safe across all Phase 2b study arms including cirrhotic subjects.  All ABT-493 and ABT-530 doses studied had a 
similar safety profile.  The most frequently reported adverse events were fatigue, nausea and headache and were mostly Grade 1 or 2 in severity.  In all subjects with baseline ALT 
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
78
elevations, ALT levels normalized or trended toward normal with DAA treatment, and 
there have been no on-treatment ALT elevations above baseline grade.
SOF, an HCV nucleotide analog NS5B polymerase inhibitor, is approved for use at a dose 
of 400 mg per day.  At this  dose, SOF has been investigated in various studies in 
combination with RBV, pegIFN/RBV, and with  the protease inhibito r simeprevir and the 
NS5A inhibitors DCV and LDV with or without RBV in cirrhotic and non-ci rrhotic 
subjects, including those with prior failure of pegIFN and a protease inhibitor.48,49  This 
dose has been shown to demonstrate significant antiviral activity with only modest treatment limiting toxicities and a safety profile that is similar to that of the AbbVie 
DAA's regimen.  Therefore this dose will used in this study.
Weight based RBV, 600 mg to 1200 mg, will be dose-divided to twice daily.  This dose is 
approved for treatment of adult and adolescent patients with chronic HCV infection in combination with pegIFN.  The same dose is selected for this study because its safety profile has been well characterized when administered with pegIFN, including incidence of hemolytic anemia, and there are well-defined dose reduction criteria in the event of RBV-induced anemia as noted in Section 6.1.7.4 .  In addition, the RBV dose was studied 
in the absence of pegIFN in adults in Studies M12-267, M12-746, M12-998, M11-652, M11-646, M13-098, M13-389, M13-961, M14-002, and M14-004, and in adolescents in Study M14-748, and the RBV dose was found to be generally safe and well tolerated and resulted in high SVR rates.  It has been demonstrated that for previous virologic failures, the inclusion of additional drugs that have  different mechanisms of action in the 
combination retreatment regimen will increase the probability to achieve SVR.

5.6.4.2 Rationale for Duration Selections
HCV infected patients who were treated and experienced a virologic failure in an AbbVie 
HCV parent study, will receive a regimen of ABT-493/ABT-530 in combination with SOF 400 mg and weight based RBV for 12 or 16 weeks in the current protocol.  Treatment duration for the study was selected based on available data from Study M15-410 and it is dependent upon the subject's HCV genotype, ci rrhotic s tatus and 
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
79
prior treatment experience with PI- and/or NS5Ai-containing regimens before 
experiencing HCV virologic failure in an AbbVie HCV parent study.  In Part 1 of Study M15-410, the efficacy and safety of ABT-493 and ABT-530 with or without RBV in adults with chronic HCV GT1 infection without cirrhosis who previously failed treatment with a DAA-containing regimen were assessed.  The interim results from this 
study, as summarized in Section 3.0, demonstrate high SVR
12rates (mITT rates of 95 –
100%) following a 12-week treatment regimen of ABT-493 and ABT-530 with or without 
RBV.  In the current study, the addition of SOF and RBV to ABT-493/ABT-530 offers multiple mechanisms of action in the retreatment regimen and will increase the probability to achieve SVR following similar treatment duration.  
In order to increase the probability to achieve SVR for subjects who are more difficult to 
treat, such as subjects with HCV GT3 infection, subjects with compensated cirrhosis and subjects who previously failed PI and/or NS5Ai-containing regimens prior to experiencing a virologic failure in an AbbVie HCV parent study, the treatment duration will be extended to 16 weeks.  Since ABT-493/ABT-530 has pangenotypic activity, subjects with mixed infections and undetermined genotypes will be allowed to be treated 
in this study.  The extended treatment duration of 16 weeks for subjects with GT3 infection was based on the study design of Part 3 of Study M14-868.  In Part 3 of Study M14-868, GT3-infected subjects who were treatment-naïve are allocated to the 
12 week arm, GT3-infected subjects who were IFN-experienced with compensated cirrhosis are allocated to the 16 week arm, GT3-infected subjects who were IFN-experienced subjects without compensated cirrhosis are allocated at a 1:1 ratio to the 12 week and 16 week treatment arms.  To be consistent with the rationale of duration selection in Study M14-868, a longer treatment duration of 16 weeks with an intensified regimen of ABT-493/ABT-530 in combinati on with SOF and RBV is selected in 
Study M15-942 for subjects with GT3 infection, in order to increase the probability to achieve SVR in HCV GT3 infected subjects who have already failed a DAA-containing regimen.
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
80
Subjects with compensated cirrhosis have historically required longer treatment durations 
versus patients without cirrhosis.  The ABT-493/ABT-530 regimen was evaluated for 12 week treatment duration in  Study M14-172 for subjects with HCV GT1, 2, 4, 5, and 
6 infection with compensated cirrhosis, who are either treatment-naïve, or PI- and NS5Ai-naïve.  In Study M14-867, subjects infected with HCV GT1 with cirrhosis were evaluated following an 8 week treatment duration with ABT-493/ABT-530.  All subjects who have completed the treatment (33 of 34) have achieved SVR.  One subject prematurely discontinued at treatment Week 4 due to an AE, and at the time of discontinuation, the subject had no detectable virus.
Subjects who failed multiple DAA regimens are considered to be a difficult to treat 
patient population.  The ABT- 493/ABT-530 regimen was evaluated for a 12 week and 
16 week treatment duration in Study M15-410, Part 2 for DAA treatment-experienced subjects with HCV GT1, 4, 5, and 6 infection with  or without compensated cirrhosis.  It is 
anticipated that a treatment duration of 16 weeks with ABT-493/ABT-530 in combination with SOF and RBV for subjects who have failed multiple DAA treatment regimens will maximize the probability of achieving SVR, and reduce the chance of HCV virologic failures across genotypes.

6.1 Medical Complaints
The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse 
events on a routine basis throughout the study.  The investigator will assess and record any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the 
adverse event to study drug, and any action(s) taken.  For serious adverse events considered as having "no reasonable possibility" of being associated with study drug, the investigator will provide an "Other" cause of the event.  For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject will be recorded.
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this  treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional ove rdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any 
worsening of a pre-existing condition or illne ss is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity of a previously reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are usually not considered to be adverse events or serious adverse events (SAE).  However, laboratory abnormalities or changes in vital signs that result in study drug discontinuation or 
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
82
interruption, necess itate therapeutic medical intervention, meets protocol specific criteria 
(see Section 6.1.7 regarding toxicity management) and/or are deemed clinically 
significant by the investigator should be r ecorded as AEs or SAEs as defined in 
Section 6.1.1.1 and Section 6.1.1.2 .
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during the study will not be considered 
an adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition 
and the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpected ly during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned due to worsening of the pre-existing condition), then the deterioration 
of the condition for which the elective surgery /procedure is being done will be considered 
an adverse event.
6.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
If an AE meets any of the following criteria,  it is to be reported to AbbVie as a SAE 
within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event:
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have 
been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any 
length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay.  This 
does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
83
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  
Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but 
based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any 
of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-
threatening, hospitalization, prol ongation of hospitalization, 
congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will rate the severity of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE Version 4).
The table of clinical toxicity grades "National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4" is available from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) website at:  http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf and is to be used in the grading of adverse events.  Below are the general grading categories.  However, the investigator should always search NCI 
ABT-493/ABT-530

CTC AE for a given diagnostic/symptomatic AE term to identify and apply specific 
grading details for that AE entity.
Grading System for Adverse Events (a semi-colon indicates 'or' within the description of 
the grade).
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms ; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental ADL*
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospi talization ind icated; disabling; 
limiting self-care ADL**
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated
Grade 5 Death related to AE
ADL = Activities of Daily Living
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.
** Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.
6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
Assessment of relatedness will be made separately with respect to ABT-493/ABT-530, 
SOF, and RBV.  The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
No Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
85
For causality assessments, events assessed as  having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not reported causality or deemed it as not 
assessable, AbbVie will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opinion of no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug is 
given, "Other" cause of event must be provided by the investigator for the serious adverse 
event.
6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All serious adverse events as well as protocol-related non-serious adverse events 
(e.g., infection at liver biopsy site) will be collected from the time the subject signed the study-specific informed consent until the administration of the first dose of study drug.  From the time of the administration of the first dose of study drug until 30 days following discontinuation of study treatmen t, all adverse events and serious adverse events will be
collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject.
After 30 days following completion of study treatment and throughout the Post-Treatment 
Period, all spontaneously reported SAEs will be collected (nonserious AEs will not be collected).
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 2 .

6.1.5 Adverse Event Reporting
In the event of a serious adverse event, whether associated with study drug or not, the 
Investigator will notify Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event by entering the serious adverse event data into the electronic data capture (E DC) system.  Serious adverse events that occur prior to the site 
having access to the RAVE
®system or if RAVE is not operable should be documented on 
the SAE Non-CRF forms and emailed (preferred route) or should be faxed to Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the serious adverse event.

The reference document used for SUSAR reporting in the EU countries will be the most current version of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).
6.1.6 Pregnancy
Subjects and their partners should avoid pregnancy, and males should avoid sperm 
donation, starting with Study Day 1 until 4 months for females subjects and 7 months for male subjects and their female partners after stopping RBV, or as directed by local RBV label, whichever is more restrictive.
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
88
Pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to AbbVie within 1 working day of the site 
becoming aware of the pregnancy.  Follow Section 5.4.1 if a female subject has a positive 
pregnancy test during the Treatment Period.  Subjects will be monitored for SVR in the Post-Treatment Period as described in Section 5.1.3 .
Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in  a study subject and the outcome of the 
pregnancy will be collected for pregnancies through the duration of the study (or per local RBV label).  The investigator is encouraged to report the pregnancy information to the voluntary RBV Pregnancy Registry.  Pregnancy in a study subject is not considered an adverse event.  However, the medical outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is considered a serious adverse event and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event.
6.1.7 Toxicity Management
For the purpose of medical management, all adverse events and laboratory abnormalities 
that occur during the study must be evaluated by the investigator.  All adverse events and laboratory abnormali ties will be managed and followed to a satisfact ory clinical 
resolution.  A toxicity is deemed "clinically significant" based on the medical judgment of the investigator.  Please refer to Section 6.1.7.1 , Section 6.1.7.2 , Section 6.1.7.3 , 
Section 6.1.7.4 , Section 6.1.7.5 , and Section 6.1.7.6 for details on Toxicity Grades.
Interruption of DAA therapy is not recommended, and if interruption occurs under extenuating circumstances (e.g., due to hospitalization of the subject), it should be less than 7 consecutive days.  If study drug interruption lasts for longer than 7 days, the investigator should contact the AbbVie Study TA MD.  The Investigator should ensure 
that any study drug interruptions or RBV dose modifications and associated adverse events are promptly entered into the appropriate eCRFs.
The toxicity management guidelines below should be followed throughout the Treatment 
Period of the study.  Specific toxicity manag ement guidelines apply to the instances of:  
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
89
decreases in hemoglobin for subjects receiving RBV (Section 6.1.7.4 ), increases in ALT 
(Section 6.1.7.5 ), and reductions in Creatinine Clearance (Section 6.1.7.6 ).
6.1.7.1 Grade 1 or 2 Laboratory Abnormalities and/or Adverse 
Events
Subjects who develop Grade 1 or 2 laboratory abnormalities or adverse events may 
continue study drugs with appropriate medical management and follow-up per study 
protocol.
6.1.7.2 Grade 3 or 4 Laboratory Abnormalities
With the exception of Grade 3 or higher abnormalities of uric acid, phosphorus, total 
cholesterol, triglycerides, or glucose (in subjects  with a history of diabetes), if a subject 
experiences a Grade 3 or greater laborat ory abnormality during the treatment period, the 
abnormal laboratory test should be repeated (repeat testing should be done on a re-drawn sample).  If the Grade 3 or greater abnormality is confirmed, the investigator should assess whether the abnormality can be managed medically as per local practice without interruption of study drug or whether study drugs should be interrupted and the laboratory parameter followed until it improves.
If study drugs are interrupted and restarted and the abnormality recurs, then study drugs 
should be permanently discontinued.
Decreases in hemoglobin level should be managed according to the guidance in 
Section 6.1.7.4 , elevations of serum ALT should be managed according to the guidance in 
Section 6.1.7.5 and reductions in creatinine clearance for subjects receiving RBV should 
be managed according to the guidance in Section 6.1.7.6 .  Grade 3 or greater 
abnormalities of uric acid, phosphorus, total cholesterol, triglycerides or glucose (in subjects with a history of diabetes) should be managed medically as appropriate and do not require confirmation or study drug interruption, unless deemed necessary by the investigator.

M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
90
6.1.7.3 Grade 3 or 4 Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events
If a subject experiences a Grade 3 or 4 adverse event or a serious adverse event that the 
investigator considers to have a reasonable possibility of relationship to study drug, the 
investigator should assess whether the adverse event can be managed medically without interruption of study drug, or whether study drugs should be interrupted until it improves.  
If study drugs are interrupted and restarted and the adverse event recurs, then study drugs 
should be permanently discontinued.
If a subject experiences a Grade 3 or 4 adverse event or serious adverse event that is 
considered unrelated (no reasonable possibility) to  the study drugs, it is not necessary to 
interrupt study drugs unless an interruption is required because of the nature of the event (e.g., unable to take oral medications).
The investigator should ensure that all serious adverse events are reported to AbbVie 
within 24 hours of awareness.  Serious adverse event follow-up information, including associated dose interruptions (or discontinuations), must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of awareness by entering updated SAE information into the appropriate eCRFs.
Grade 3 or 4 adverse events and any associated dose interruptions (or discontinuations) 
should be entered into the appropriate eCRFs.
6.1.7.4 Management of Decreases in Hemoglobin for Subjects 
Receiving RBV
Reductions in hemoglobin are a well characterized side effect of RBV exposure.  If a 
subject experiences a hemoglobin decrease that meets the criteria outlined in Table 13 , a 
confirmatory test should be performed.  If the hemoglobin decrease is confirmed to meet 
the criteria, the management guidelines in Table 13 should be followed, unless local RBV 
label requires a more stringent management.  Management will be different for subjects without a history of known cardiac diseas e and subjects with known cardiac disease.
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
91
Use of hematologic growth factors (such as erythropoietin, filgrastim), or blood 
transfusions is not recommended and is permitted only with approval of the AbbVie Study TA MD.  Management of hematologic growth factor therapy is the responsibility of the investigator, and growth factors will not be provided by AbbVie.
Alternate management of hemoglobin decreases outside of these criteria requires approval 
of the AbbVie Study TA MD, except for more stringent management requirement from a local RBV label.

If hemoglobin < 10 g/dL despite being for 4 weeks on the reduced RBV dose, permanently discontinue RBV and manage the subject as medically appropriate
Hemoglobin < 8.5 g/dL or 
< 12 g/dL after 
4 weeks of dose 
reductionPermanently discontinue RBV and manage the subject as medically appropriate
Enter discontinuation into appropriate eCRFs and create corresponding adverse event
* For subjects aged 12 to less than 18, RBV dose reduction should be per local RBV label.
Management of other hematologic parameters besides hemoglobin (like WBC, platelets, 
neutrophils, etc.) should be performed according to the local RBV label.  Alternative RBV dosing can be used if agreed upon by AbbVie TA MD.

6.1.7.5 Management of Increases in ALT
If a subject experiences a post-baseline ALT value ≥ 5 × ULN that is also ≥ 2 × Baseline 
value, the subject should have a confirmatory test should be performed.  If, the ALT is 
value confirmed ≥ 5 × ULN, and ≥ 2 × Baseline value, the recommendations below 
should be followed:
●Complete hepatic questionnaire
●Evaluate for alternate etiology of ALT elevation; document in the source, 
update the medical history and concomitant medications eCRF (if applicable),and obtain Anti-HAV IgM, Anti-HAV Total , Anti-HBc IgM, Anti-HBc Total, 
Anti-HBs, HBV DNA, HBsAg, Anti-HEV IgM, Anti-HEV IgG and HEV RNA, and other additional tests, as appropriate.
●Manage the subject as medically appropriate.
●Repeat ALT, AST, total and fractionated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and INR within 1 week.  Repeat liver chemistries as indicated until resolution.
●Discontinue study drugs if any of the following is observed at any time:
○ALT level is ≥ 20 × ULN in the absence of an alternate etiology.
○Increasing direct bilirubin or INR or onset of symptoms/signs of hepatitis.
○At the discretion of the investigator.
Alternate management of confirmed ALT increases requires approval of the AbbVie 
Study TA MD.
6.1.7.6 Management of Reductions in Creatinine Clearance for 
Subjects Receiving RBV
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, calculated using the MDRD equation) and 
Creatinine clearance (CrCl, estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation) will be calculated throughout the study.  Both results w ill be provided to the investigators, but 
toxicity management and RBV dose adjustment will be performed based on CrCl values only.  
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
94
If a subject experiences an CrCl value below 50 mL/min, a confirmatory test should be 
performed as soon as possible.  If CrCl is confirmed to be below 50 mL/min, medical evaluation should include a full review of concurrent medications, including those taken on an as needed basis, those which are sold over the counter, and any dietary and herbal supplements.  
In addition, the following should occur:
●Concomitant medication dose reduction based on CrCl or eGFR should be 
done as per local prescribing informatio n of the concomitant medication (if 
applicable).  
●The AbbVie Study TA MD should be c ontacted to discuss whether dose 
modification or drug substitution may be required for concomitant medications 
given the reduced kidney function as well as potential drug interactions with 
the DAAs.  Drug interactions between concomitant med ications and the 
DAAs, for example, could potentially increase antihypertensive medications' 
exposures, especially in the setting of re duced kidney function and may result 
in further deterioration of renal function.  Also, if anti-hypertensive medications are adjusted, vital signs must be closely monitored to ensure appropriate blood pressure control.
●The dose of RBV should be adjusted as follows:  
○for CrCl between 30 and 50 mL/min:  alternating doses of 200 and 400 mg 
every other day; 
○for CrCl less than 30 mL/min – 200 mg  daily.  
●A urine specimen should be obtained for urinalysis (including urine for albumin), and a separate urine specimen for archive should be obtained.
●Creatinine clearance and any other necessary analytes should be repeated 
within 7 days and as clinically indicated until resolution.
○If CrCl improves to > 50 mL/min within 14 days after RBV dose 
modification, consideration should be given to increase RBV dose towards 
the original value.  If CrCl decreases below 50 mL/min again, RBV should be permanently discontinued.
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
95
The investigator should ensure that any concomitant med ication changes, RBV dose 
modifications, study drug interruption and study drug discontinuations, as well as related 
adverse events are entered into the appropriate eCRFs.
Alternative management of RBV dose in the setting of reduced renal function will require 
approval of the AbbVie Study TA MD, unless it is a more stringent management required by local RBV label.
6.1.8 Collection of Data Regarding Known AIDS-Defining 
Conditions
HIV-1 infected subjects participating in clinical trials may develop conditions typically 
associated with AIDS.  A lis t of these known AIDS-Defining Conditions (ADCs) is 
presented in Appendix D .  The events listed in Appendix D will be summarized as HIV-
related events, not as adverse events.  These ADCs will be collected from the time of study drug administration until 30 days following discontinuation of study drug.
6.2 Product Complaint
6.2.1 Definition
A Product Complaint is any Complaint (see Section 6.0for the definition) related to the 
biologic or drug component of the product.
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or 
packaging, product appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the labeling/instructions (example:  printing illegible), missing components/product, or packaging issues.

variables (e.g., age and BMI).  The number and percentage of subjects will be presented for categorical variables (e.g., gender and race).
Study drug exposure and compliance will be summarized.  Treatment compliance to study 
drug will be calculated based on the percentage of tablets taken relative to the total tablets expected to be taken.  A subject is considered to be compliant if the percentage is between 80% and 120%.  Compliance will be calculated for each subject and summarized with the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  The percentage of compliant subjects will be summarized for each treatment arm.
8.1.2 Efficacy

interval.
8.1.3 HCV Resistance Analyses
The genes of interest for NGS in this study are those encoding full length NS3/4A, NS5A 
and NS5B.  For each DAA target, signature resistance-associated amino acid positions 
will be identified by AbbVie Clinical Vi rology.  An appropriate prototypic reference 
sequence will be used for comparison with sequences from samples.
Only samples with an HCV RNA level of ≥ 1000 IU/mL will undergo sequence analysis 
in order to allow accurate assessment of products of amplification.  Therefore, if the HCV 
RNA level at the time of HCV virologic failure or treatment discontinuation is < 1000 IU/mL, the sample closest in t ime after HCV virologic failure/treatment 
discontinuation with an HCV RNA level ≥1000 IU/mL will be used.  Included time 
points for analyses on samples from subjects who do not achieve SVR
12are 1) the sample 
closest in time after failure/discontinuation with an HCV RNA level of ≥ 1000 IU/mL,
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
103
and 2) 24 weeks post-DAA treatment, provided that resistance-associated variants were 
detected by NGS at the time of HCV virologic failure/treatment discontinuation.
The following definitions will be used in the HCV resistance analyses:
●Baseline variant: a variant (by NGS) in a baseline sample ( ≥ 2% or ≥  15% 
prevalence within a subject's viral population depending on variant frequency 
threshold utilized) that was not present in appropriate prototypic reference amino acid sequence for a given DAA target.
●Post-baseline variant:  an amino acid variant in a post-baseline time point sample that was not detected at baseline (< 2%) in the subject and is detectable 
in ≥ 2% of the sequences from the post-baseline sample in a given DAA target.
●Enriched variant:  variant present in both the baseline and a post-baseline 
sample whose prevalence in the post-baseline sample is at least 20 percentage points greater than the prevalence in the baseline sample [(post-baseline % –
baseline %) ≥ 20]
●Treatment-emergent variant: A post-baseline variant or an enriched variant.
●Variant at signature amino acid position:  va riant (relative to reference) present 
in a baseline or a post-baseline sample at a signature amino acid position.
The following analyses will be performed for all subjects:
To characterize prior HCV DAA resistance patterns in the study population, available 
resistance analysis data obtained at the time of the subject's virologic failure of the previous DAA treatment will be collected and reported.
For all subjects, the following will be provided:
●The number and percentage of subjects with baseline variants at detection-
thresholds of ≥ 2% and ≥  15% for variants at signature amino acid positions, 
and ≥ 15% for variants at non-signature positions.
●A listing of all baseline variants ( ≥ 2% detection threshold) at signature 
resistance-associated amino acid positions for each DAA target.
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
104
●A listing of all baseline variants ( ≥ 15% detection threshold) at non-signature 
resistance-associated amino acid positions for each DAA target.
●A listing of subjects with multiple baseline variants at signature amino acid 
positions (each at ≥ 15% prevalence within a subject's viral population), either 
within a DAA target or across any 3 DAA targets.
●The impact of baseline variants on treatment outcome will be assessed as 
follows:  for each variant, the SVR 12rate will be calculated for subjects with 
and without the variant and the 2 rates will be compared.  Analyses will be grouped by subject's HCV subtype and DAA target.  Subjects not achieving SVR
12due to non-virologic reasons will be excluded from this analysis.  These 
analyses will be performed based on the following criteria:
○An analysis will be performed based on amino acid position, using 
detection thresholds of ≥ 2% and ≥  15% for all variants at each signature 
amino acid position and a detection threshold of ≥ 15% for all variants at 
each non-signature amino acid position.
○An additional analysis will be performed using detection thresholds of ≥2% and ≥ 15% for the impact of each specific variant as specified by 
clinical virology.
The following will be provided for subjects who do not achieve SVR
12and have post-
baseline resistance data available:
●A listing by subject of all treatment-emergent variants relative to the baseline sequence will be provided for each DAA target
●A listing by subject of all variants at signature amino acid positions
●The number and percentage of subjects (with subject listing) with variants emerging at an amino acid position relative to baseline
●The number and percentage of subjects (with subject listing) with certain specific emerged variants
The persistence of post-baseline variants at signature resistance-associated amino acid 
positions for each target will be assessed by NGS at Post-Treatment Week 24.  A listing 
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
105
by subject and time point of all post-baseline variants relative to the baseline amino acid 
sequence will be provided for each DAA target.
If resistance-associated variants are not detected in a given target for a subject at the time 
of failure/discontinuation, then that target may not be sequenced in subsequent samples from that subject.
Phylogenetic analysis will be conducted on HCV sequences from available baseline 
samples from all subjects in the study in order to accurately determine their subtypes.  The resulting subtype information will be presented in summaries of baseline characteristics and efficacy subgroup analyses.
8.1.4 HIV Resistance Analyses
If a subject develops a confirmed, plasma HIV-1 RNA level ≥ 500 copies/mL after 
starting the study, the subject's HIV-1 PR, RT, and/or IN sequences, as applicable, will be 
analyzed by Monogram Biosciences using the GenoSure
®Prime drug resistance assays.  
The number of subjects who demonstrate HIV genotypic resistance and the genotypic resistant mutations detected in the samples obtained from these subjects will be tabulated and summarized.  Resistance will be defined as described by the IAS-USA Panel.
48
8.1.5 Safety
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the safety analyses.  All safety analysis will be done by treatment arm and overall.
8.1.5.1 Adverse Events
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA).  The number and percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (i.e., any event that begins or worsen s in severity after initiation of study drug 
through 30 days post-study drug dosing) will be tabulated by primary MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  The tabulation of the number of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events by severity grade (Grades 1 – 5) and r elationship 
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
106
to each study drug also will be provided.  Sub jects reporting more than one adverse event 
for a given MedDRA preferred term will be counted only once for that term using the 
most severe grade for the severity grade table and the most related for the relationship to study drug tables.  Subjects reporting more than  one type of event within a SOC will be 
counted only once for that SOC.
Additional analyses will be described in the statistical analysis plan.
8.1.5.2 Clinical Laboratory Data
Clinical laboratory tests will be summarized at each visit.  The baseline value will be the 
last non-missing measurement prior to the initial dose of study drug.  Mean changes from 
baseline to each post-baseline visit, including Final Treatment Visit, will be summarized descriptively.
Laboratory data values will be categorized as low, normal, or hi gh based on reference 
ranges of the laboratory used in this study.  The number and percentage of subjects who 
experience post-baseline shifts during treatment in clinical laboratory values from 
low/normal to high and high/normal to low based on the normal range will be summarized.
In addition, the number and percentage of subjects with post-baseline values meeting pre-
specified criteria for Potentially Clinically Significant laboratory values or toxicity grades during treatment will be summarized.
8.1.5.3 Vital Signs Data
Mean changes in temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and weight 
from baseline to each post-baseline visit, including Final Treatment Visit, will be summarized.  The number and percentage of subjects with post-baseline values meeting pre-defined criteria for Potentially Clinically Significant vital signs values during treatment will be summarized.

8.1.5.4 HCV/HIV-1 Co-Infection
The following additional safety data will be summarized and analyzed for subjects with 
HCV/HIV-1 co-infection overall and in each treatment arm:
●The percentage of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA suppression at the end of 
treatment and at Post-Treatment Week 12 using the FDA Snapshot Algorithm;
●The number and percentage of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 20 copies/mL at each applicable time point;
●Change from baseline in CD4+ T-cell count (absolute and percent) to each applicable post-baseline time point;
●Change from baseline in lymphocytes (count and percentage) and CD8+ T- cell 
counts (absolute and percent) to each applicable post-baseline time point;
●The listing of subjects with a plasma HIV-1 RNA value ≥ 200 copies/mL at 
any baseline or post-baseline visit during the study.
The analysis of change fro m baseline in  CD4+ T-cell c ount (absolute and percent), 
lymphocytes (count and percentage) and CD8+ T-cell counts (absolute and percent) will 
report the mean and median values at baseline and at each applicable post-baseline visit, as well as N, mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum and maximum values for the change from baseline overall and within each treatment arm.
8.1.6 Pharmacokinetic and Exposure-Response Analyses
Plasma concentrations of ABT-530, ABT-493, RBV, SOF and GS-331007 and 
pharmacokinetic parameter values for ABT-493 and ABT-530 will be tabulated for each subject and group.  Summary statistics will be computed for each time and visit.
Plasma concentration data from this study may be combined with data from other studies 
and analyzed using the following general methodology:
Population phar macokinetic analyses will be performed using the actual sampling time 
relative to dosing.  Pharmacokinetic models will be built using a non-linear mixed-effect 
modeling approach with the NONMEM software (version VII, or higher version).  The 
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
108
structure of the starting pharmacokinetic model will be based on the pharmacokinetic 
analysis of data from previous studies.  Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of the PK analytes will be the pharmacokinetic parameters of major interest in the NONMEM analyses.  If necessary, other parameters, including the parameters describing absorption characteristics, may be fixed if useful in the analysis.  The evaluation criteria described below will be used to examine the performance of different models.
●The objective function of the best model is significantly smaller than the 
alternative model(s).
●The observed and predicted concentrations from the preferred model are more randomly distributed across the line of unity  (a straight line with zero intercept 
and a slope of one) than the alternative model(s).
●Visual inspection of model fits, standard errors of model parameters and 
change in inter-subject and intra-subject error.
Once an appropriate base pharmacokinetic model (including inter- and intra-subject error 
structure) is developed, empirical Bayesian estimates of individual model parameters will be calculated by the posterior conditional est imation technique using NONMEM.  The 
relationship between thes e conditional estimates CL/F and V/F values with only 
potentially physiologically relevant or clinically  meaningful covariates (such as subject 
age, sex, body weight, concomitant medications, laboratory markers of hepatic or renal function, etc.) will be explored using stepwise forward selection method, or a generalized additive method (GAM), or another suitable regression/smoothing method at a significance level of 0.05.  After identification of all relevant covariates, a stepwise backward elimination of covariates from the full  model will be employed to evaluate the 
significance (at P< 0.005, corresponding to an increase in objective function > 7.88 for 
one degree of freedom) of each covariate in the full model.
In general, all continuous covariates will be entered in the model, initially in a linear 
fashion, with continuous covariates centered around the median value.  Linear or non-
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
109
linear relationships of primary pharmacokinetic parameters with various covariates may 
also be explored.  For example:
TVCLi = Theta(1) + Theta(2) (Comedication [1,2,…] + Theta(3) (WTi-median value) + 
Theta(4) (AGEi – median value).
Where TVCLi = Typical value of clearance for an individual i1, Theta(1) is the intercept 
and Theta(2) – (4) are regression parameters relat ing the fixed effects (weight and age 
centered on the median value) to clearance.
Relationship between exposure (e.g., population pharmacokinetic model predicted 
concentrations over time or average concentrations or AUC or trough concentrations of the individual model-predicted pharmacokinetic profiles, or some other appropriate measure of exposure) and clinical observations (antiviral activity) will be explored.  Exposure-response relationships for primary and secondary efficacy variables and/or some safety measures of interest may also be explored.
Additionally, relationship between exposure and safety endpoints of interest may also be 
explored.  Additional analyses will be performed if useful and appropriate.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
It is anticipated that approximately 50 HCV infected, DAA treatment-experienced 
subjects who have experienced virologic failure in an AbbVie HCV parent study will be enrolled.  
8.3 Randomization Methods
This study is not randomized.  Eligible subjects will be allocated to a treatment arm 
according to their HCV genotype, cirrhosis status (presence/absence), and prior treatment experience with PI- and/or NS5Ai-containing regimens before experiencing virologic failure in the AbbVie HCV parent study.

9.0 Ethics
9.1 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requires that the clinical protocol, any protocol 
amendments, the Investigator's Brochure, the informed consent and all other forms of subject information related to the study (e.g., a dvertisements used to recruit subjects) and 
any other necessary documents be reviewed by an IEC/IRB.  The IEC/IRB will review the ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted.  IEC/IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent and subject information and/or advertising, as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a study site.
Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/IRB approval and approval by 
Regulatory Authority(ies), if required by local regulations, prior to implementation of any changes made to the study design.  The investigator will be required to submit, maintain and archive study essential documents according to ICH GCP and all other applicable regulatory authorities.
Any serious adverse events that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated by local 
regulations, will be reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory Agencies, as required by local regulations.  During the conduct of the study, the investigator should promptly provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports, and any additional reports required by local regulations) to the IEC/IRB of any changes that affect the conduct of the study and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation of the submission to the IEC/IRB should also be provided to AbbVie.
9.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Council on 
Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines governing clinical 
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
111
study conduct and the ethical principles th at have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  Responsibilities of the clinical investigator are specified in Appendix A .
9.3 Subject Information and Consent
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject, and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to any study-related screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be reviewed and signed and dated by the subject, the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements.  A copy of the informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record.  An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
The optional pharmacogenetic testing and analyses will only be performed if the subject 
has voluntarily signed and dated the IRB/IEC approved pharmacogenetic informed consent, after the nature of the testing has been explained and the subject has had an opportunity to ask questions.  The pharmacogenetic informed consent must be signed before the pharmacogenetic testing is performed.  If the subject does not consent to the additional pharmacogenetic testing, it w ill not imp act the subject's participation in the 
study.
In the event a subject withdraws from the main study, optional pharmacogenetic 
exploratory research samples will continue to be stored and analyzed unless the subject 
specifically withdraws consent for the optional samples.  If consent is withdrawn for the optional sampling, the subject must inform their study doctor, and once AbbVie is informed, the optional samples will be dest royed.  However, if the subject withdraws 
his/her consent and the samples have already been tested, those results will still remain as 
part of the overall research data.

10.0 Source Documents and Case Report Form 
Completion
10.1 Source Documents
Source documents are defined as original documents, data and records.  This may include 
hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory data/information, subjects' diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing and other records, recorded data from 
automated instruments, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, and/or x-rays.  Data collected during this study must be recorded on the appropriate source documents.  The Investigator Awareness Date (SAE CRF) may serve as the source for this data point.  This adverse event data point required for eCRF completion can be entered directly in the eCRF.
The investigator(s)/institution(s) will permit study-related monitoring, audits, IEC/IRB 
review, and regulatory inspection(s), providing direct access to source data documents.
10.2 Case Report Forms
Case report forms (CRF) must be completed for each subject screened/enrolled in this 
study.  These forms will be used to tran smit information collected during the study to 
AbbVie and regulatory authorities, as applicable.  The CRF data for this study will be collected with an electronic data capture (EDC) system called Rave
®provided by the 
technology vendor Medidata Solutions Incorpor ated, NY, USA.  The EDC system and the 
study-specific electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will comply with Title 21 CFR Part 11.  The documentation related to the validation of the EDC system is available through the vendor, Medidata, while the validation of the study-specific eCRFs will be conducted by AbbVie and will be maintained in the Trial Master File at AbbVie.
The investigator will document subject data in his/her own subject files.  These subject 
files will serve as source data for the study.  All eCRF data required by this protocol will be recorded by investigative site personnel in the EDC system.  All data entered into the eCRF will be supported by source documentation.
ABT-493/ABT-530
M15-942 Protocol Amendment 2EudraCT 2016-002491-26
113
The investigator or an authorized member of the investigator's staff will make any 
necessary corrections to the eCRF.  All ch ange information, includi ng the date and person 
performing the corrections, will be available via the audit trail, which is part of the EDC system.  For any correction, a reason for the alteration will be provided.  The eCRFs will 
be reviewed periodically for completeness, legibility, and acceptability by AbbVie personnel (or their representatives).  AbbVie (or their representatives) will also be allowed access to all source documents pertinent to the st udy in order to verify eCRF entries.  The 
principal investigator will review the e CRFs for completeness and accuracy and provide 
his or her electronic signature and date to eCRFs as evidence thereof.
Medidata will provide access to the EDC system for the duration of the trial through a 
password-protected method of internet access.  Such access will be removed from investigator sites at the end of the site's participation in the study.  Data from the EDC system will be archived on appropriate data media (CD-ROM, etc.) and provided to the investigator at that time as a durable record of the site's eCRF data.  It will be possible for the investigator to make paper printouts from that media.
11.0 Data Quality Assurance
To ensure data integrity and subject safety, a study monitor will continuously, throughout the study, verify that all subjects sign the informed consent prior to any study specific procedures being conducted, that the protocol procedures are being followed appropriately, and that the information provided in the eCRF is complete, accurate, and supported by information in source documents.  Computer logic and manual checks will be created to identify items such as inconsis tent study dates.  Any necessary corrections 
will be made to the eCRF.
12.0 Use of Information
Any research that may be done using optional pharmacogenetic exploratory research samples from this study will be experimental in nature and the results will not be suitable 
for clinical decision making or patient management.  Hence, the subject will not be

Duration of Treatment:   12 or 16 weeks.
Criteria for Evaluation:
Efficacy:
Efficacy will be assessed utilizing plasma HCV RNA levels throughout the study.
Resistance:The following information will be tabulated and summarized:  1) for all subjects receiving study drug 
with available samples, the variants at baseline at signature resistance-associated amino acid positions relative to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence; and 2) for subjects who do not achieve SVR
12
and who have a post-baseline sample, all treatment-emergent variants relative to baseline.
Pharmacokinetic:

(GS-331007), and RBV will be tabulated and summarized.
Safety:Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring adverse events, physical examinations, clinical 
laboratory tests, and vital signs.
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects who achieve SVR 12(HCV RNA < LLOQ 
12 weeks after the last actual dose of study drug) in each treatment arm and overall.  The primary 
endpoint will be analyzed based on intention to treat (ITT) population.  The number and percentage of subjects achieving SVR
12will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using the 
normal approximation to the binomial distribution, unless number of virologic failures is less than 5, then the Wilson's score method will be used for the confidence interval instead.
The secondary efficacy variables are:
!The percentage of subjects with on-treatment HCV virologic failure in each treatment arm and 
overall;
!The percentage of subjects with post-treatment HCV virologic relapse in each treatment arm and overall.
The number and percentage of subjects meeting each secondary efficacy endpoint will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using the Wilson score method.  Analyses of additional efficacy endpoints and efficacy subgroup analyses will be performed.
Resistance:
For all subjects receiving study drugs and with available samples, the variants at signature resistance-
associated amino acid positions at baseline identified by next generation sequencing (NGS) and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence will be analyzed.
The following resistance information will be analyzed for subjects receiving study drugs who do not 
achieve SVR
12and who have a post-baseline sample with HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL:  1) the amino acid 
variants in available post-baseline samples identified by NGS and comparison to the baseline sequence, 
2) the amino acid variants in available post-baseline samples at signature resistance-associated positions identified by NGS and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence, and 3) the persistence of viral variants by NGS.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Pharmacokinetic:
Plasma concentrations of ABT-493, ABT-530, SOF, primary metabolite of SOF (GS-331007), and RBV 
will be tabulated for each subject and treatment arm.  Summary statistics will be computed for each 
treatment arm.
Safety:
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drugs will be included in the safety analyses.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Safety summaries will be provided by treatment arm and overall.  The number and percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (i.e., any event that begins or worsens in severity after initiation of study drug) will be tabulated by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  The tabulation of the number of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events also will be 
provided by grade and relationship to study drug.  Change from baseline in laboratory tests and vital signs measurements to each time point of collection will be summarized, and values that are potentially clinically significant, according to predefined criteria, will be summarized by treatment arm and overall.

5.4.1.1 HCV Virologic Failure Criteria
The following criteria will be considered evidence of OTVF, for the purposes of subject 
management, leading to discontinuation of study drug: 
●Confirmed increase from nadir in HCV RNA (defined as 2 consecutive HCV
RNA measurement of > 1 log10 IU/mL above nadir) at any time point during 
study drug treatment; or
●Confirmed HCV RNA ≥ 100 IU/mL (defined as 2 consecutive HCV RNA 
measurements ≥ 100 IU/mL) after HCV RNA < LLOQ during study drug 
treatment.
Confirmatory testing should be completed as  soon as possible and the subject should 
remain on study drug treatment until the OTVF criterion has been confirmed.  Subjects 
with confirmed OTVF will be discontinued from study drug and will continue to be 
followed in the Post-Treatment Period for the emergence and persistence of resistant viral substitutions until 24 weeks post-treatment ( Appendix C ).
Post-treatment relapse is defined as confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ (defined as 
2 consecutive HCV RNA measurements ≥ LLOQ) at any post-treatment visit, for subjects 
who completed treatment (defined as study drug duration ≥ 77 days for subjects who 
received 12 weeks or ≥ 103 days for subjects who received 16 weeks) and had HCV RNA 
< LLOQ at the final treatment visit, excluding cases of reinfection, as defined below.  HCV reinfection is defined as confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after the end of treatment in 
a subject who had HCV RNA < LLOQ at Final Treatment Visit, along with the post-treatment detection of a different HCV genot ype, subtype, or clade compared with 
baseline, as determined by phylogenetic analysis performed by the sponsor of the HCV NS3, NS5A, and/or NS5B gene sequences.  R einfection in the case of the same HCV 
subtype is defined as a clade switch, as indicated by the lack of clustering between the baseline and post-treatment sequences by phyloge netic analysis.  If phylogenetic analysis 
is not possible due to technical difficulties,  HCV reinfection may be determined with a

 Secondary: 
Compare the response rates fo r the transfusion independent and the transfusion 
dependent patients. For example t he response rate of two different drugs DAC versus 
AZA on abbreviated schedule to a  standard arm of AZA given over  5 days.  
 
Evaluate the durability of respons e, the overall and transforma tion-free survival rates, 
and the safety profile of 2 different drugs.  The quality of life protocol  (2014-0636) titled “Interventional  Validation of an MDS-
Specific Measure of Quality o f Life:  Assessing the Responsiven ess of the QUALMS-1 
to Different Hypomethylating Agent Regimens fo r Low and Interme diate Risk Disease” 
was written specifically as a companion study to protocol 2014- 0112 and may be 
offered as an optional assessmen t to patients enrolled onto thi s protocol. 
 
II. RATIONALE 
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) a re clonal hematopoietic stem-c ell disorders 
characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, peripheral-blood cy topenias, and increased 
tendency to progress to acute  myeloid leukemia (AML).
1 Median age of patients with 
MDS is approximately 70 years.2 This patient population is frequently a ffected by other 
comorbid conditions, a factor that often influences treatment d ecisions.  
 
Treatment of MDS is based on prognos tic factors that predict su rvival and progression 
to AML. The most widely used prognostic system for therapeutic decision making is still 
  2014-0112 
October 19, 2016 
3 
 the International Progn ostic Scoring System.3 This system stratifies patients into the 
following four groups: low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and  high risk. Risk is based 
on number of cytopenias, percent age of bone marrow blasts, and karyotype. Low risk 
and intermediate-1 risk are usually grouped together as lower-r isk disease, whereas 
intermediate-2 risk and high ri sk are grouped together as highe r-risk disease. Several 
other factors have recently been shown to have prognostic value . These include, among 
others, the need for RBC transfusions4 and the presence of retic ulin marrow fibrosis.5 
Analysis of recently identified genetic and i mmunophenotypic al terations has not yet 
been introduced in the therapeutic  decision making of MDS.1 
 
The survival of patients with hi gher-risk MDS is significantly different than that of 
patients with lower-risk disease . Without intervention, median survival of higher-risk 
patients is close to 12 months.3 Survival of patients with lower-risk disease is more 
diverse and ranges from a few months (poor-prognosis, lower-ris k disease) to more 
than a decade (Fig 1 and Tables 1 and 2).3,6 Risk of transformation  to AML in lower-risk 
MDS is less than 30%.6 A recent analysis has indicated that most patients with lower-
risk MDS die from causes directly related to complications of M DS.7  
 Therefore, the objectives of ther apy are different in lower- versus higher-risk disease. In 
higher-risk MDS, treatment options  should impact survival as a primary end point. In 
lower-risk MDS, therapies should  be adapted to specific patient  situation, including 
severity and type of cytopenias and expected survival.
6 Therefore, in lower-risk MDS, 
  2014-0112 
October 19, 2016 
4 
 therapies should have the capacit y to improve transfusion needs  and potentially 
survival.  
 
Until recently, treatment approac hes in patients with lower-ris k MDS have focused on 
improving transfusion needs. It should be noted that we conside r transfusions as part of 
supportive care in MDS. In general , patients with lower-risk MD S do not receive therapy 
until they become transfusion dependent. This notion could be c hallenged by the recent 
report that the prognosis of patients with lower-risk MDS is he terogeneous, ranging from 
9 months to more than a decade.6 This model may allow the identification of patients 
with lower-risk disease and poor  prognosis (Fig 1). The questio n is whether the more 
aggressive treatment of these pat ients, can favorably change th e natural history of this 
group of patients with poor pr ognosis and lower-risk disease.  
 
In MDS, tumor suppressor genes are  silenced by the effects of i rregular DNA 
hypermethylation.8-9 Two hypomethylating agents (HMA), decitabine at 20 mg/m2 IV 
daily for 5 days every months , and azacitidine at 75 mg/m2 IV/SC daily for 7 days every 
month, are approved for treatment of patients with higher-risk MDS.8-9 The use of the 
hypomethylating agent azacitidine, has been formally shown in a  randomized clinical 
trial to improve survival of patients with higher-risk MDS.8 Furthermore, azacitidine given 
over 5 days was found to be equiva lent to a regimen given over 7 days in a phase II 
randomized trial.11  
 
  2014-0112

 We assessed the use of decitabine  in patients with lower risk M DS. In a phase II trial, 
decitabine given at lower dose, 20 mg/m2 IV daily for 3 days ever y month induced an 
objective response rate of 23% i n 43 patients wit h low and inte rmediate-1 risk disease. 
The median overall survival (OS ) was not reached; about 70% of patients were alive at 
500 days. The safety profile was adequate.10  
 
Results from a study investigatin g alternative SC azacitidine dosing schedules in lower-
risk patients with MDS suggested that a lower dose schedule (37 5 mg/m2 total dose) 
was beneficial.11   Furthermore, clinical respons es were reported in patients wh o 
received oral azacitidine, a form ulation proven to have lower d rug exposure and DNA 
hypomethylation relative to SC azacitidine.   We have recently initiated a phase II randomized trial comparin g decitabine to 
azacitidine given in an abbreviate d way of 3 days in patients with low-risk MDS. So far, 
34 patients were enrolled (19 tr eated with azacit idine and 15 w ith decitabine). 24 
patients are evaluable for response. The response rates were 31 % and 36% for patients 
treated with azacitidin e and decitabine respec tively with no significant toxicity.     
 Given our previous experience a nd considering the above data in  support of lower 
doses regimen we propose to eval uate in a phase II Bayesian design the efficacy of 
DAC versus AZA versus standard AZ A (5 days) in patients with lo w and intermediate-1 
risk MDS transfusion-dependent ver sus BSC in patients with low and intermediate-1 risk 
MDS transfusion-independent .

III. BACKGROUND DRUG INFORMATION 
A. Decitabine: 
Decitabine (Dacogen™, 5-aza-2’- deoxycytidine) is an analogue of  the natural 
nucleoside 2’- deoxycytidine. It is believed to exert its antin eoplastic effects after 
phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibitio n of DNA 
methyltransferase, causing hypome thylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or 
apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at 
concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synth esis. In rapidly 
dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attr ibuted to the formation of 
covalent adducts between DNA met hyltransferase and decitabine i ncorporated into 
DNA. Non-proliferating cells are r elatively insensitive to deci tabine. 
 
In solid tumor patients who rece ived 72-hour infusion of decita bine at 20 to 30 
mg/m2/day, decitabine pharmacokinetics were characterized by a bipha sic disposition. 
The total body clearance (mean ± SD) was 124 ± 19 L/hr/m2, and the terminal phase 
elimination half-life was 0.51 ± 0.31 hr. T he exact route of el imination and metabolic fate 
of decitabine is not known in hum ans. One of the pathways of el imination of decitabine 
appears to be deaminati on by cytidine deami nase found principal ly in the liver but also 
in granulocytes, intestinal epith elium and whole blood. In vitr o studies in human liver 
microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 
enzymes. In vitro  metabolism studies have suggest ed that decitabine is not a sub strate 
for the human liver cyt ochrome P450 enzymes. As plasma protein binding of decitabine 
  2014-0112 
October 19, 2016 
7 
 is negligible (<1%), interactions  due to displacement of more h ighly protein bound drugs 
from plasma proteins are not expected. 
 
Decitabine has been approved by t he Food and Drug Administratio n (FDA) in the United 
States for treatment of patients with MDS including previously treated and untreated, de 
novo and secondary MDS of all French-Am erican-British subtypes (refr actory anemia,  
refractory anemia with ringed si deroblasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts, 
refractory  anemia with excess blasts in transformation, and chronic myelom onocytic 
leukemia) and  intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high-risk International Pro gnostic 
Scoring System (IPSS)  groups.  
 
The major toxicity is myelosup pression. Decitabine may also cau se fever, cough, 
constipation, diarrhea, nausea, v omiting, edema, headache, inso mnia and 
hyperglycemia. Rarely, decitabine  can cause allergic reactions.4 
 
B. Azacitidine (AZA) 
Azacitidine, a ring analog of the pyrimidine nucleoside cytidin e, has effects on cell 
differentiation, gene expression , and DNA synthesis and metabolism. Since the early 
1970s, azacitidine has been invest igated in the US for the trea tment of acute leukemia. 
Clinical trials have focused pr imarily on patients with disease refractory to conventional 
chemotherapy. These investigations  indicated azacitidine has ac tivity in the treatment of 
acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Clinical trials subsequently have been conducted 
to evaluate the effects of azacitidine in a variety of other ma lignant and hematologic 
  2014-0112 
October 19, 2016 
8 
 disorders, including solid tumo rs, hemoglobinopathies (thalassemia and sickle cell 
anemia), and myelodysplast ic syndromes (MDS). 
 
Toxicology studies have been con ducted in mice, rats, dogs, and Rhesus monkeys. 
Most of the studies were perfo rmed during the 1970s and early 1 980s according to 
existing guidelines and standards in place during that period. The nonclinical studies 
identified the bone marrow, liver , kidneys, and lymphoid tissue s (spleen, lymph nodes) 
as the main target organs of toxicity. In single-dose studies, the lethal dose of 
azacitidine after intravenous (IV) administration in mice, rats , and dogs was 
approximately 250 mg/m2. Repeated daily dosing appears to increase the toxicity of 
azacitidine. The genotoxicity of a zacitidine is consistent with  that of other nucleoside 
analogs that interact with nucleic acids. Likewise, similar to other agents with cytostatic 
properties, azacitidine was embr yotoxic and reduced the reprodu ctive performance in 
mice and rats. It is important to n ote that animal study data i s superseded in many 
respects by the extensive clin ical safety data collected in the  last two decades. 
 
Limited azacitidine pharmacokinet ic data are currently availabl e. Based on plasma 
concentrations of total radioactivity (which represent parent d rug plus circulating 
metabolites), azacitidine is r apidly absorbed when given subcut aneously (SC), with 
maximum plasma concentrations f ound 0.5 to 2 hours after dosing. Azacitidine and/or 
its by-products are rapidly cleared by the kidneys. The half-li ves and percent 
radioactivity recovered in urine are similar for the IV and SC routes of administration.

 The effects of renal or hepatic  impairment, gender, age, and race on the 
pharmacokinetics of azaciti dine have not been studied. 
 
In 1985, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) study investigators began clinical 
trials with azacitidine in MDS  patients under t he auspices of the National Cancer 
Institute (NCI). Results from  the three studies conducted by th e CALGB (Protocols 
8421, 8921, and 9221) have been published. The first two CALGB studies (Protocol 
8421 and Protocol 8921) w ere uncontrolled Phas e 2 investigation s. The most recent 
CALGB study (Protocol 9221) was a  Phase 3 investigation that compared azacitidine to 
supportive care alone. The azacitid ine dose investigated in the  CALGB studies was 75 
mg/m2/day for 7 days, repeated on a 28-day cycle. Azacitidine w as administered by 
continuous IV infusion in the fi rst study (Protocol 8421), and by SC injection in the two 
studies that followed. The dose wa s adjusted based on toxicity and clinical response. In 
the Phase 3 investigation (Protocol 9221), azacitidine produced  higher response rates 
than supportive care alone. In addition, azacitidine prolonged the time to transformation 
to AML or death.  The efficacy of azacitidine to treat MDS also was evaluated in 7 open-label studies 
conducted outside the CALGB protocols. T he dosage regimen used in 6 of these 
studies was 75 mg/m
2 given daily for 7 days every 3-4 weeks by SC injection in 4 
studies, SC or IV in 1 study, and the route was not specified i n the last study. The 
dosage regimen used in the seventh study was 5-35 mg/m2/day given by continuous IV 
infusion for 14 days. The lowest response rate was found in thi s seventh study, which 
  2014-0112

10 
 suggests the mechanism of 5-azaciti dine’s activity requires repeated administration of a 
minimally effective dose to achie ve improvement in hematologic parameters. 
 
As with other antimet abolites, bone marrow suppression (leukope nia, 
thrombocytopenia) is a common adv erse event associated with azacitidine. However, 
myelosuppression generally occur s more often and with greater s everity at doses higher 
than those used to treat MDS. Gast rointestinal toxicity (ie, na usea, vomiting, and 
diarrhea) can limit the dose of a zacitidine in any patient popu lation. Infrequent adverse 
effects include neuromuscular aches, generalized weakness, rena l tubular acidosis, and 
liver enzyme abnormalities. Eryt hema and burning at the injecti on site can occur 
following SC administration, whi ch usually resolves within 24-72 hours.  
 
Azacitidine is approved for all patients with MDS using FAB cri teria (up to 30% blasts).

V. Treatment plan 1. Study design  
Transfusion-dependent subjects wil l be randomized to AZA 75 mg/ m
2 IV/SC for 5 days, 
AZA 75 mg/m2 IV/SC for 3 days, or DAC 20 mg/m2 IV for 3 days on an even basis at the 
beginning, then, based on effica cy and following a Bayesian design, patients will be 
assigned to the superior arm.   
Transfusion-independent subjects  will be randomized to either B SC or one of the 3 
arms mentioned above on an even basis at the beginning, then, b ased on efficacy and 
following a Bayesian design, patients will be assigned to the s uperior arm. 
 Transfusion-independent subjects  assigned to BSC will be assign ed to one of the 3 
above arms once they start requiring blood transfusion. That would be considered an event.   
  2014-0112 
October 19, 2016 
12 
 Transfusion-dependent group will be defined as patients requiri ng blood transfusion for 
MDS or CMML-1 at any time.  
 2. Treatment plan 
Patients will be rando mized to receive: 
Decitabine 20 mg/m
2 IV daily for 3 days (da ys 1-3) approximately  every 28 days 
or Azacitidine 75 mg/m
2 SC or IV daily for 3 days (days 1-3) approximately every 28 da ys 
or 
Azacitidine 75 mg/m2 SC or IV daily for 5 days  (days 1-5) approximately every 28 days 
or BSC (for transfusion-i ndependent subjects only) 
Patients may receive their second course of therapy without int erruption, regardless of 
their degree of myelosuppression . After the first course of the rapy, the interval between 
subsequent cycles of therapy could  be shortened or prolonged at the discretion of the 
investigator. Subsequent cycles c an be given prior to periphera l blood count recovery if 
considered to be in the best int erest for the patient and after  discussion with the 
principal investigator and t he discussion docu mented in the pat ient’s medical record. If 
study drug related prolonged myel osuppression (≥42 days of absolute neutrophil count 
[ANC] <1 x 10
9/L and platelet count <30 x 109/L) is observed after cycle 2, subsequent 
cycles may be given at the nex t lower dose (DAC, 15 mg/m2/day, then 10 mg/m2/day, 
then 5 mg/m2/day; AZA, 56 mg/m2/day, then  37 mg/m2/day, then 18 mg/m2/day) after 
recovery (ANC ≥1 x 109/L and platelet count >50 x 109/L) and subsequent cycles of 
  2014-0112 
October 19, 2016 
13 
 AZA.  Granulocyte-colony stimula ting factor for fever of unknow n origin, infection, and/or 
ANC <0.75 x 109/L can be administered. 
 
Dose reductions can also be made in other clinical situations w here this step is 
considered to be in the best int erest for the patient and after  discussion with the 
principal investigator and t he discussion docu mented in the patient’s medical record. 
The following table is a suggesti on for dose modifications in s ubsequent treatment 
courses:

discontinuation of therapy due  to side effects, or death.  
Secondary: 
1. Overall improvement rate (OIR ), defined as complete remissio n (CR), partial 
remission (PR), marrow CR (mCR), o r hematologic improvement (HI ), measured 
using each patient’s best respons e with the 2 different agents.  Response will be

 assessed using the modified MDS International Working Group 2006 criteria. The 
best response within the first tw o cycles will be the OIR for e ach treatment arm 
that will be used in  the adaptive randomiz ation algorithm. 
2. Transfusion independence (def ined as being transfusion-free for ≥8 consecutive 
weeks between the first dose an d study treatment discontinuatio n)  
3. Cytogenetic response, if applicable 4. Clinical benefit 5. Duration of response 6. Time to transformation into AML 7. Overall survival 8. Safety profile 
 VII. CRITERIA FOR WITHDRAWAL 
Reasons for withdrawal include: 
• Withdrawal of consent or the subject refuses to continue treatment and/or 
procedures/observations. • Relapse/progression unless t he treating physician determines that the patient has 
achieved clinical benefit, at wh ich time further therapy on pro tocol may be permitted 
with approval from the PI and t he discussion documented in the patient’s medical 
record. • No response after at least 6 c ourses unless the treating phys ician determines that the 
patient has achieved clinical benefit, at which time further th erapy on protocol may be 
permitted with approval from the PI and the discussion documented in the medical 
  2014-0112 
October 19, 2016 
18 
 record. A bone marrow bi opsy and/or aspirate is required to con firm that the patient has 
not achieved a response. 
• Intercurrent illness preventi ng further administration of pro tocol treatment, 
• Unacceptable toxicity that in the opinion of the investigator  makes continued therapy 
unsafe. 
 
VIII. CRITERIA FOR RESPONSE

XII. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
General Description 
 
  2014-0112 
October 19, 2016 
21 
 This is an adaptive randomized phase II trial for low-risk MDS patients. Regarding the 
patients transfusion status, pat ients can be categorized as tra nsfusion dependent and 
transfusion independent patients.  It is expected that there wil l be half of the transfusion-
dependent patients and half of tr ansfusion-independent patients . For transfusion 
dependent patients, the goal is to  compare three treatment arms : 1) DAC, 2) AZA3 
(treatment of 3 days), and 3) AZA 5 (treatment of 5 days). For t ransfusion independent 
patients, the goal is to compare  four treatment arms: 1) best s upportive care (BSC) 2) 
DAC, 3)AZA3 (treatment of 3 days), and 4) AZA5 (treatment of 5 days). The primary 
outcome is event free survival (EF S) defined as the time from b eginning of treatment till 
an event occurs or last follow- up. For transfusion independent patients, the events 
includes lack of response, requi rement of blood transfusion, pr ogression to advanced 
stages of disease, transformation into AML, discontinuation of therapy due to side 
effects, and death. The patients who change from transfusion in dependence to 
transfusion dependence under BSC wi ll be enrolled in transfusio n-dependent group and 
adaptively assign to the three tr eatment arms, that is, DAC, AZ A3, or AZA5. For 
transfusion dependent patients, the events includes lack of res ponse, progression to 
advanced stages of disease, transformation into AML, discontinu ation of therapy due to 
side effects, and death. 
 
Study design 
The maximum number of patient s accrued will be 240. There will be two parallel 
adaptive randomization trials for transfusion dependent  (N=120 ) and transfusion 
independent (N=120) patients respectively. Since we are expecti ng patients under BSC 
  2014-0112 
October 19, 2016 
22 
 will eventually become the transfusion dependent, it is assumed that initially there will 
be 120 patients under transfusi on-dependent group, and the total number increases to 
about 150 after enrolling the approximate 30 pat ients under BSC . 
 
 Part I Transfusion dependent patients (N=150)  
Design 
Patients will be rando mized using a Baye sian adaptive algorithm. Patients will be 
randomized fairly among the three arms at the start of the tria l (for the first 30 patients), 
that is, 10 patients per arm. Thereafter, as the trial progress es and data accrue, the 
randomization will bec ome unbalanced in favor of the treatment that, on average, has 
better results in terms of even t free survival. Therefore, each  successive patient is more 
likely to receive the treatment with better results, on average. A minimum of 30 and a 
maximum of 150 patients will be a ccrued. There will be 12 months follow up after the 
last patient is accrued with an anticipated accrual rate of 5 p atients per month. 
 
Denote the event free survival for the patients in the three ar ms (DAC; AZA3; AZA5) as 
Ti for i=1,2,3. Assume the T i is independent exponen tial with median µ i. And each µ i 
independently follows an inverse gamma distribution with parame ter α=2.05, β=7.34. 
The parameters were chosen to set the mean of the prior equal to 7 (the historical 
median EFS in months) and a vari ance of 1000. For each patient, the randomization 
probability for treatment arm i will be based on the posterior probability that it has the 
largest median EFS. For example, for arm 1, the posterior proba bility is π 1=Pr(µ 1> µi) for 
i=2,3. In order to avoid aggressi vely favoring one arm too earl y in a large trial, instead of 
  2014-0112 
October 19, 2016 
23 
 assigning patients with posterior probability, we use its squar e root transformation as in 
the following formula to assign patients: 
 
Aa=
3 2 11
  
 ,  where Aa is the probability of  assigning patients to arm 1,  π1 is 
the posterior probability that  arm 1 is superior, etc. 
 
If at any point during the trial Pr(µ i>max{u j, for all j ≠i} |data) >  0.975, the trial will be 
terminated and treatment i will be s elected as superior.  If at  any point during the trial 
Pr(µi>max{uj, for all j ≠ i}  |data)<0.025, then accrual to the arm i will be suspended, 
and will be reopen if in the future , the changes in other arms make this probability 
Pr(µi>max{uj, for all j ≠ i} |data) ≥ 0.025.   If the maximum accrual is reached and Pr 
(µi>max{u j, for all j ≠i }|data) > 0.8 (< 0.2), treatment i will be selecte d as superior 
(inferior).  A treatment arm will be dropped at any point durin g the trial if Pr(µ i > 7 
|data) < 0.1, for i=1,2,3. Table 3 given below summarizes opera ting characteristics of 
the design. The historical median EFS is assumed to be  7 month s with the accrual 
rate of 5 patients per month . The trial will be stopped early a nd a treatment selected 
as being “better” if the probabi lity that one treatment’s median EFS is larger than the 
other’s EFS exceeds 0.975. If th e trial does not stop early and  the maximum 150 
patients are accrued, a  treatment is selected as being “better”  if the probability that 
one treatment’s median EFS is la rger than the other’s EFS excee ds 0.8. A treatment 
arm will be dropped at any point dur ing the trial if the probab ility that the treatment’s 
median EFS is larger than 7 mont hs is less than 0.1. The “# of patients treated” row is 
  2014-0112 
October 19, 2016 
24 
 the average number of patients treated on a given arm under the given scenario. 
When the medians all equal to 7 m onths (scenario 1), the probability of selecting one 
of the three arms (i.e., a fals e positive result) is at most 9. 8%. The probability of 
selecting the best treatment (i.e. , a true positive result) for  scenario 2, when the 
medians EFS are 7, 7, and 12 months for the arms, respectively,  are 0.7%, 0.7%, 
and  88%.

Toxicity Monitoring 
 Evidence of toxicity will be monitored closely for all patients . As expected, there will be 
150 transfusion-dependent patients enrolled which includes the 120 patients initially 
recruited and another 30 patient s who have changed from transfu sion independence to 
dependence. With 10 patients fairly randomized to each arm, the re will be at most 120 
patients being adaptively assigned to any of the three arms. Taking the initial 10 
patients assigning to each arm,  the maximum number of patient per treatment arm will 
be 130.  For each treatment, tr eatment will be terminated if Pr ((
E >0.2 | data)  >0.9, 
where E is the proportion of any grade 3 or higher treatment related n on-hematologic 
toxicities. It is assumed to follow a non-informative prior of Beta (0.4, 1.6)   That is, the 
trial will be terminated if at any time during the study, there  is a more than 90% chance 
that the average rate of grade 3 or  greater treatment related n on-hematologic toxicity is 
more than 20%. Patients will be monitored by a cohort size of 1 0 according to the 
following stopping boundaries for toxicity. The design software Multc Lean Desktop

Design 
 Patients will be rando mized using a Baye sian adaptive algorithm. Patients will be 
randomized fairly among the four a rms at the start of the trial  (for the first 40 patients), 
that is, 10 patients per arm. Thereafter, as the trial progress es and data accrue, the

maximum of 120 patients will be a ccrued. There will be 12 months follow up after the 
last patient is accrued with an anticipated accrual rate of 4 p atients per month. 
 
Denote the event free survival f or the patients in the four arm s (BSC; DAC; AZA3; 
AZA5) as T
i for i=1,2,3,4. Assume the T i is independent exponential with median µ i. And 
each µ i independently follows an inverse gamma distribution with param eter α=2.14, 
β=13.73. The parameters were chos en to set the mean of the prio r equal to 12 (the 
historical median EFS in months) and a variance of 1000. For each patient, the 
randomization probability for treatment arm i will be based on the posterior probability 
that it has the largest median EFS. For example, for arm 1, the  posterior probability is 
π1=Pr(µ 1> µi) for i=2,3,4. In order to avoid favoring one arm earlier in a large trial, 
instead of assigning patients wit h posterior probability, we us e the following formula to 
assign patients:  
Aa=

   
  , where Aa is the probability of  assigning patients to arm 1,  
π1 is the posterior probability that arm 1 is superior, etc.

 If at any point during the trial Pr(µ i>max(u j for all j ≠i )|data) > 0.975 (< 0 .025), the trial 
will be terminated and treatment i  will be selected as superior  (inferior).  If the 
maximum accrual is reached and Pr (µ i>max{u j for all j ≠i}|data) > 0.8 (< 0.2), 
treatment i will be selected as superior (i nferior).  A treatme nt arm will be dropped at 
any point during the trial if Pr(µ i > 12 |data) < 0.1, for i=1, 2,3,4. Table 6 given below 
summarizes operating characterist ics of the design. The histori cal median EFS  is 12 
months. The tables below assume an accrual rate of 4 patients per month. The trial 
will be stopped early and a treatment selected as being “better” if the probability that 
one treatment’s median EFS is la rger than the other’s EFS excee ds 0.975. If the trial 
does not stop early and the maxi mum 120 patients are accrued, a  treatment is 
selected as being “better” if the probability that one treatment’s median EFS is larger than the other’s EFS exceeds 0 .8. A treatment arm will be dropped at any point 
during the trial if the probabilit y that the treatment’s median  EFS is larger than 12 
months is less than 0.1. The “# o f patients treated” row is the  average number of 
patients treated on a given arm under the given scenario. When the medians all 
equal to 12 months (scenario 1),  the probability of selecting one of the three arms 
(i.e., a false positive result) is at most 3.7 %. The probabili ty of selecting the best 
treatment (i.e., a tr ue positive result) for scenario 5, when the medians TTP are 12, 
12, and 24 months for the arms, respectively, are 0.1%, 0.04%, 0.2%, and  79.7%.

 Data analysis will be performed using SAS or S-plus, as appropr iate. All patients will be 
included in the intent-to-trea t analysis for efficacy.  Demogra phic and disease 
characteristics of the patient s at registration will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics such as mean, st andard deviation (SD), median and ra nge. The EFS under 
different treatment will be estimated by Kaplan-Merier method, along with the 95% 
credible intervals, and logrank test will be used to assess the  EFS differences under 
different treatments. The Cox proportional hazards model will b e used to analyze the 
effects of treatments and other covariates.

Leukemia-specific Adverse Event Recording and 
Reporting Guidelines 
 
These guidelines serve to bring the Department of Leukemia in c ompliance with the 
institutional policy on Reporting of Serious Adverse Events-def inition of expected AE-" 
All clinical protocols should include a list of the expected an d anticipated events or 
hospitalizations relating to the study treatment" and Guideline  for Good Clinical 
Practice 4.11.1 "All serious adverse events (SAEs) should be re ported immediately to 
the sponsor except for those SAEs that the protocol or other document  (e.g., 
Investigator’s Brochure) identifies as not needing immediate reporting".   Adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that may prese nt during treatment 
with a pharmaceutical product but which does not necessarily ha ve a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  Adverse drug reaction is a response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and 
which occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, dia gnosis, or therapy of 
disease or for the modification of physiologic function. 
 
Assessing causal connections between agents and disease is fund amental to the 
understanding of adverse drug reactions. In general, a drug may  be considered a 
contributory cause of an adverse event if, had the drug not bee n administered, 1) the 
event would not have happened at all, 2) the event would have o ccurred later than it 
actually did, or 3) the event would have been less severe.  Adverse Events (AEs) will be evaluated according to current CTC version in each protocol. Only unexpected AEs will be recorded in the Case Repo rt Form (CRF).  
Expected events during leukemia therapy are: 
1. Myelosuppression related events (due to disease or leukemia therapy) 
a. febrile or infection episodes not requiring management in the intensive 
care unit 
b. epistaxis or bleeding except for catastrophic CNS or pulmonary 
hemorrhage 
c. anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, 
leukocytosis 
2. Disease related events 
a. symptoms associated with anemia 
i. fatigue ii. weakness iii. shortness of breath 
b. electrolyte abnormalities (sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, CO2, 
magnesium) 
c. chemistry abnormalities (LDH, phosphorus, calcium, BUN, protein, 
albumin, uric acid, alkaline phosphatase, glucose) 
d. coagulation abnormalities 
e. disease specific therapy (induction, maintenance, salvage, or stem cell 
therapy) 
  2014-0112

38 
 f. alopecia 
g. bone,  joint, or muscle pain h. liver function test abnormalities associated with infection or disease 
progression 
i. disease progression 
3.  General therapy related events 
a. catheter related events b. renal failure related to tumor lysis syndrome or antibiotic/antifungal therapy c. rash related to antibiotic use 
4. Hospitalization for the management of any of the above expected events  
Abnormal hematologic values will not be recorded on the CRF. Fo r abnormal 
chemical values grade 3 or 4, the apogee will be reported per c ourse in the CRF. 
 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE) 
 
A serious adverse event (experience) or reaction is any untowar d medical occurrence 
that at any dose  
Results in death 
Is life-threatening Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experi ence when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
this definition. Examples of such medical events include allerg ic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or  the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32). 
 
(Sections relating to ORERM are for MDACC held IND studies only.)   
Important medical events as defined above may also be considered serious adverse events. Any important medical event can and should be r eported to 
the IRB as an SAE if deemed appropriate by the Principal Invest igator, the 
IND Sponsor, or the Office of Research Education and Regulatory  
Management (ORERM).  All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeti ng the definition 
of a SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures outlined in “Universi ty of Texas M. D. Anderson Canc er Center 
Institutional Review Board Policy on Reporting Serious Adverse Events”.   
Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, 
must be reported to ORERM, regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge of the event). Hospitalizations for the management of any 
expected adverse events (previously described) will not have an

 expedited report but it will be included in the annual report v ia the SAE 
log. 
 
All life-threatening or fatal events, expected or unexpected, and regardless of 
attribution to the study drug, must have a written report submi tted within 24 
hours (next working day) of knowledge of the event to the Safet y Project 
Manager in ORERM.    The MDACC “Internal SAE Report Form for Prompt Reporting” will be used for 
reporting to ORERM.   
Serious adverse events will be captured from the time the patie nt signs 
consent until 30 days after the last dose of drug. Serious adve rse events must 
be followed until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory tests have 
returned to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, or there has 
been acceptable resolution of the event. 
 
Additionally, any serious adverse  event that occur after the 30  day time period 
that is related to the study treatment must be reported to IRB and ORERM. 
This may include the development of a secondary malignancy. 
  
Reporting to FDA  
Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by the IND Spon sor (Safety 
Project Manager ORERM) according to 21 CFR 312.32. 
 
It is the responsibility of the PI and the research teams to en sure serious adverse 
events are reported according to the Code of Federal Regulation s, Good Clinical 
Practices, the protocol guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, a nd Institutional Review 
Board policy. 
  Reporting of external SAEs 
The MDACC institutional policy for reporting of external SAEs will be followed.

*********************************************************************************************  
 1.  Abstract  
Children and adults with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) are at risk of developing a vitamin D deficiency or 
insufficiency, defined as a 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) serum blood level <30 ng/mL. 
Greater than 85% of people with CF have pancreatic insufficiency, which contributes to poor 
absorption of fat soluble vitamins and dietary fats. A 25OHD level greater than 30 ng/mL has 
been shown to provide improvements  to markers of inflammation in adults with CF and is 
known to improve bone mineral density and prevent bone fractures in all populations, including 
CF. This study will assess the safety of a one -time high dose of cholecalciferol or vitamin D3 
along with ef ficacy and feasibility of providing this therapy.   
  
Children between the ages of 3 years and 18 years (inclusive), with a 25OHD level <30 ng/mL 
will be provided with a vitamin D3 supplement of 250,000 international units (IU) observed in 
our CF clinic. W e hypothesize that this one -time, oral, high dose of vitamin D3 will safely and 
effectively raise the 25OHD level to above 30 ng/mL.   
  
Safety will be monitored using a tiered safety protocol. Within the first tier, a serum calcium 
level and a serum phosp horus level will be measured at 1 week and 3 months following the 
dosage. This timing is appropriate as cholecalciferol has a half -life of 2 -3 weeks and these timed 
levels  would be at or near the middle of the 25 -OHD range. A second tier safety evaluation  will 
only be done if serum calcium levels or serum phosphorus levels are elevated. For this second 
tier, the participant will have a parathyroid hormone level measured (PTH) as well as a spot 
urine calcium to creatinine ratio.   
  
Feasibility is to be mea sured using a 10 -question phone survey 1 week following the dosage (see 
appendix A - attached). Efficacy will be measured by the 25OHD level itself; if 25OHD levels 
are found to be between 30 -100 ng/mL over the course of the study, the dose will have 
demon strated effectiveness in achieving the study’s goal.   
  
The purpose of this study is to show that 25OHD levels can be safely corrected with a one -time 
dose of vitamin D3 and be feasibly provided in the outpatient setting to children with CF.

 3.  Background   
Cystic Fibrosis is an inherited disease that primarily affects the lungs but also can affect the 
pancreas, liver and gastrointestinal tract. Subsequently, the bone health of individuals is also 
compromised due to complications arising from malnutrition, ma labsorption, and repeated 
pulmonary exacerbations.   
  
Greater than 85% of individuals with Cystic Fibrosis have pancreatic insufficiency, meaning that 
their pancreas does not produce digestive enzymes to chemically break down carbohydrates, fats, 
and proteins. It is known that a majority of digestion takes place in the duodenum of the small 
intestine where the digestive enzymes are secreted by the pancreas to the duodenum in 
preparation for the chyme that is released from the stomach. Without digestive enzymes, 
individuals with CF end up with large macronutrients passing through the small and large 
intestine undigested, unabsorbed and eventua lly excreted. Maldigestion and malabsorption 
results in steatorrhea or fatty stools. Therefore, individuals with CF are required to take 
porcinebased pancreatic replacement enzymes before each meal or snack to digest and absorb the 
carbohydrates, fats and proteins in their food.   
  
In addition to having difficulty digesting and absorbing macronutrients, individuals with CF also 
have difficulty absorbing fat soluble vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E and 
vitamin K . Therefore, individuals with  CF are prescribed higher maintenance dosages of these 4 
micronutrients to ensure they have adequate absorption and do not become deficient. Individuals 
with CF require significantly more than the current recommendations vitamins, calories and 
protein. Rec ent literature has demonstrated that a substantial proportion of patients with CF are 
vitamin D  insufficient and the current guidelines in treating their clinical insufficiency are not 
adequate (1).Adequate vitamin D status is defined and measured by a 25 OHD level of greater 
than or equal to 30 ng/mL. Vitamin D insufficiency is defined as a 25OHD level of between 
2029 ng/mL and vitamin D deficiency is defined as a 25OHD level of less than 20 ng/mL.   
  
Adequate vitamin D levels have been frequently linked to improving bone mass in those with 
and without CF. Low levels of vitamin D (25OHD) make it difficult for the body to produce 
sufficient osteoclasts, which are found in growing bone (1).  Lower than expected  bone mass of 
the spine and whole body has been  potentially linked to suboptimal levels of vitamin D in

Page 4 of 18  pediatric patients with CF (2). In  adult CF populations, sufficient levels of vitamin D have also 
been linked to reductions in inflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin6 
(3).   
  
The Cystic Fibrosis foundation currently outlines step -wise treatment for vitamin D insufficiency 
as well as for vitamin D deficiency (4). A Cochrane review describing vitamin D 
supplementation in cystic fibrosis was published in 2012. The authors re ported that none of the 
studies in the review had closely examined bone mineral density relationship, nutritional status, 
or growth related to vitamin D. Lung function at baseline was reported in one of the studies; 
however, no data was collected in any of  the reviewed studies indicating proportions of 
respiratory exacerbations and none of the reviewed studies assessed quality of life (5). Therefore, 
there is still extensive research needing to be performed with regards to CF and vitamin D 
insufficiency.   
  
Currently, our CF center at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital are seeking to improve the 
administration of vitamin D to our insufficient  CF patients. We know that individuals with CF 
are burdened with multiple medications throughout the day. The cur rent administration of 
vitamin D to our patients who have vitamin D insufficiency include a recommendation for the 
parent or caregiver to purchase vitamin D as cholecalciferol in the prescribed amount, at a local 
drug store, and to administer to the patien t once daily with food and with enzymes (if 
applicable). After consistently providing this prescribed dose for 12 weeks, the patient is asked 
to have his/her 25OHD level re -drawn with a second venipuncture. Anecdotally we have 
discovered that parents and c aregivers often do not obtain the prescribed amount of vitamin D by 
the next CF clinic visit 2 -3 months later and will also delay the second episode of venipuncture 
due to anxiety surrounding this procedure.   
  
When we analyzed our center specific data on  vitamin D levels and treatment, we discovered that 
our current efforts reveal approximately 87% of our population have vitamin D levels  within the 
past twelve months. Of those tested, 53 (40%) demonstrate levels between 30 ng/ml and 40 
ng/ml and 43 (33%)  below 30 ng/ml (insufficient), the remaining 27% had levels below 20 
ng/mL (deficient). Current empirical and anecdotal data show a clear need for improvement in 
administration of vitamin D3 for the purpose of correcting vitamin D insufficiency and 
defici ency in this pediatric CF population.  
  
As evidenced by our recent analysis, we continue to face challenges in our efforts to improve 
vitamin D abnormalities. Insurance companies rarely, if ever, cover vitamin supplements, putting 
the financial burden on parents. Adding additional medication to already expansive chronic 
therapy increases the burden of care for everyone involved. Repeating vitamin D level tests 
several times a year results in significant patient and family stress for those with needle avers ion, 
including additional costs to insurance and other financial entities.  
  
To address these challenges, we are exploring alternatives to our current treatment methods.  
These include increasing the daily maintenance dose of vitamin D3 across the board.

Page 5 of 18  Alternatively, we are evaluating  implementation of STOSS (single high -dose oral vitamin D3) 
therapy. Research has shown that a one -time high dosage of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), 
increases 25OHD levels in the Cystic Fibrosis population as well as the n on-CF population in 
both pediatric and adult individuals, without hypercalcemia and with reductions in parathyroid 
hormone (PTH) (6, 7, 8, 9).  If successful, changing the current route of correcting vitamin D 
insufficiency via STOSS therapy would provide financial relief related to medication access and 
a decrease in burden of care.   
  
Research has displayed that the human body’s response to vitamin D3 is biphasic, meaning it 
responds rapidly to low vitamin D3 doses and responds much slower to a larger vi tamin D3 dose. 
Heaney et al. found that the low doses of vitamin D3 had a half -life of 20 -30 days, but a high 
dose, such as 100,000 IU vitamin D3 had a half -life of 50 days (10). The authors hypothesized 
that perhaps at this higher dosage the vitamin D3 is  being stored in fat and other body tissues and 
then slowly released; whereas the daily low doses of vitamin D3 provide an immediate increase 
or response that can sometimes be reflected in the blood sample.  
  
In children and adults without malabsorption d isorders, the current recommended range of daily 
vitamin D intake ranges from 400 IU per day for children as recommended by the American 
Academy of Pediatrics (11). Whereas the Institute of Medicine or IOM recommends a range of  
600 IU to 4000 IU per day b ased on the age of the child. The IOM committee did increase its  
“upper level intake”.  That dose is 4,000 IU/day for adults, 3,000 IU/day for kids aged 4 -8, 2,500 
IU/day for kids aged 1 -3, 1,500 IU/day for infants aged 6 -12 months, and 1,000 IU/day for 
infants aged 0 -6 months. The Endocrine Society for Patients at risk for vitamin D deficiency 
recommend a daily requirement of 400 IU -1000 IU for children depending on age and their 
upper level intake is 2000 -4000 IU per day depending on age as well (12, 13) . However, these 
recommendations are not for children with absorption disorders such as Cystic Fibrosis.  
  
According to the National Institutes of Health, 25 -OHD levels which are consistently greater 
than 200 ng/mL are "potentially toxic" (13). The IOM co mmittee found no conclusive evidence 
that increased vitamin D levels confer increased health benefits, challenging the concept that 
“more is better". However, this was meant to be applied to healthy populations. A review of 
literature conducted in 2013 dis played that intoxication from vitamin D supplementation was 
rare in the pediatric setting. This same review also found that hypervitaminosis was “usually 
asymptomatic” and errors in formulation of the vitamin, manufacturing or prescription of the 
vitamin r esulted in intoxication (13).  
  
Vitamin D toxicity or hypervitaminosis D is characterized by elevated serum calcium levels or 
hypercalcemia (14). Due to the hypercalcemia, acute symptoms of toxicity can include muscle 
weakness, confusion, vomiting, anorexia, polyuria and polydipsia. In a ddition, hypercalcemia 
can be chronic, and those symptoms of intoxication from hypervitaminosis D could include bone 
demineralization, pain, and nephrocalcinosis.   
  
Therefore, we believe STOSS therapy will efficaciously, safely and feasibly increase vita min D 
levels to above 30 ng/mL in our pediatric CF population. We hypothesize that STOSS therapy

greater than or equal to 30 ng/mL without instances of hypercalc emia (7).  
  
 4.  Study Procedures   
The study is a phase 2 single arm study that will assess the safety, feasibility and efficacy of a 
high dose of vitamin D3 as cholecalciferol in Cystic Fibrosis pediatric patients with a 25OHD 
level <30 ng/mL. The member s of the study team will enroll 30 participants who have consented 
and meet eligibility criteria, including a baseline 25OHD level <30 ng/mL which is measured 
annually, at a minimum, as a part of the current standard of care. All patients with CF, will be 
consented to participate upon having his/her annual lab work collected.   
  
As patients present with a 25OHD level < 30 ng/mL they will be screened to see if they meet full 
eligibility criteria for enrollment. This will include a phosphorus level and spot urine calcium to 
creatinine ratio which will be collected at their CF visit (patients seen at the St. Petersburg 
office) or within 2 weeks prior to their visit if in Sarasota or Tampa. (See section 5 for complete 
inclusion/exclusion criteria). Screening wi ll also consist of a urine pregnancy test to be 
completed the day of the administration of the high dose of vitamin D.   
  
After a patient meets full eligibility criteria, they will be enrolled in the study and we will 
administer the 250,000 IU vitamin D3 at that visit. Upon administration, each participant will be 
provided with an oral, one -time dosage of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in the form of capsules 
that will be swallowed; the capsule cannot be crushed or dissolved in anything in order to be 
admini stered.   
  
Participants will be witnessed by a member of the study team to confirm 100% adherence. With 
this, they will also be provided with water and saltine crackers to take with the vitamin D by 
mouth. If the participant is on pancreatic enzymes, they  will be required to take their prescribed 
snack dosage with this as outlined by their CF Physician. The participants will be notified to 
bring their own supply of pancreatic enzymes to this visit with them. If the participant forgets to 
bring pancreatic e nzymes, enzymes will be provided to them at a dosage closest to the prescribed 
snack dosage.   
  
If the participant has an episode of emesis upon taking the high dose of vitamin D3 at any time 
following the dose, the participant will not be provided or required to take any additional high 
dose of vitamin D3 for study purposes. They will continue to be followed in the study. They will 
also continue to take their previously prescribed standard CF vitamins as dictated by standards of 
care throughout the study; this information will be kept in a secure study database. Information 
on the participant’s daily CF vitamin/mineral prescription, including total International Units of 
cholecalcif erol they are receiving will be collected at each study visit. Additionally, information 
on the participant’s pancreatic function, i.e.: pancreatic insufficiency or pancreatic sufficiency 
will be collected at baseline, among other demographic data.

Page 7 of 18  As m uch as possible, we will try to have study visits coincide with clinic visits which usually 
occur every 3 months as a part of the current standard of care. A study calendar describing all 
study procedures is found at the end of this section.  
  
The followi ng safety measures have been reviewed and approved by two Johns Hopkins All 
Children’s Hospital Endocrinologists: As additional measures of safety at 7 days to the next 
working business day of the administration of the 250,000 IU of vitamin D3, all partici pants will 
also have a serum calcium and serum phosphorus level measured. If any participant has a serum 
calcium above the upper limits of normal (ULN) for their age (appendix B), they will be 
contacted via telephone to be queried about symptoms of hyperca lcemia such as muscle 
weakness, confusion, vomiting, anorexia, confusion, polyuria and polydipsia. If the patient has 
more than 1 symptom of hypercalcemia and an elevated serum calcium level, we will consider 
this an adverse event. During this communicatio n, it will be decided if any type of treatment will 
be needed to remedy the complaint (see section on treatment of hypervitaminosis D from 
hypercalcemia).   
  
If any participant has a serum calcium level greater than the ULN for age or a serum phosphorus 
level greater than the ULN for age, a second tier of safety measures will be taken. This will 
include measuring a PTH with reflex calcium level as soon as possible, within approximately  7 
days ( + 3 days) of the serum calcium or phosphorus lab draw. In addi tion, we will obtain a spot 
urine calcium to creatinine ratio. Calcium levels and/or phosphorus levels will be repeated every 
2 weeks ( +7 days) until normalized for age. If the spot urine calcium to creatinine ratio is > ULN 
for age (Appendix C) we will ob tain an Endocrinology consult and if symptomatic be instructed 
to go to the Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital for evaluation . The urine calcium to 
creatinine ratio will be repeated in 1 week ( +3 days) and then monthly ( +7 days) until 
normalized for ag e. Proposed treatment for hyperphosphatemia will involve increased fluids and 
restriction of phosphorus loaded foods. Proposed treatment for hypercalcemia, as reflected by a 
serum calcium level, is detailed in another section of this protocol.   
  
To evalu ate for feasibility, at 7 days to the next working business day after administration of the 
250,000 IU administration of Vitamin D3, participants will be contacted by a member of the 
study team via phone to answer a 10 -item questionnaire which is included as an appendix at the 
end of this protocol. This questionnaire is to assess feasibility of the 250,000 IU Vitamin D3.  
  
Regardless of serum calcium level or other labs collected, if a participant does become ill after 
taking the high dose of vitamin D3 (e.g., muscle weakness, confusion, vomiting, anorexia,  
polyuria and polydipsia, etc.) they will be asked to call the CF office number , 727.767.3995. 
During this communication, it will be decided if any type of treatment will be needed to remedy 
the complaint (see section on treatment of hypervitaminosis D from hypercalcemia).  If their 
serum calcium level was within normal limits for ag e, but they have symptoms of those found 
with hypercalcemia, it will be noted in our study findings but not classified as an adverse event.  
  
At 12 weeks ( + 30 days) from the initial study visit, participants will be required to have another 
25OHD level m easured via venipuncture as a part of standard of care. In addition, as a part of the

Page 8 of 18  first tier of safety measures, a serum calcium and serum phosphorus level will be measured 
again. If either of these levels is elevated, a PTH level will be measured as s oon as possible 
within approximately 14 days ( + 3 days) of this serum calcium lab draw.  If serum calcium level 
is above ULN a spot urine calcium to creatinine ratio will be ordered. At 26 weeks ( + 30 days) 
and 52 weeks ( + 30 days) the participants will ha ve 25OHD levels measured again. No 
additional one -time  high dosage of vitamin D3 will be prescribed or provided during the study 
period for any reason to any of the participants. No additional measures of safety, in the forms of 
serum calcium labs, serum phosphorus, or PTH will be measured.  
  
Any participant with an elevated serum calcium level of anything above normal limits for age 
will be instructed to limit calcium containing foods in their diet, stop supplements with 
additional vitamin D and/or calci um. Since these participants will be called regarding their 
elevated serum calcium level to query about symptoms of hypercalcemia, we will be able to 
instruct them on this.   
  
If at any time after the study intervention has started and the participant has  a 25OHD level less 
than 30 ng/mL, they will be placed on the current standard CF Foundation step -wise guidelines 
for treatment appropriate for their low vitamin D level.  
  
There will not be a placebo group, as the study design does not support this; prov iding a placebo 
is not ethical in this population for this condition.   
  
If a patient does not complete the study for any reason, meaning they do not get each set of lab 
work completed, their results up to that point in time will still be used in the stud y but their 
duration of participation will be noted in the results section. Every effort will be made to contact 
patients who are lost to follow up to ascertain the reason for withdrawal.

 6.  Drugs/ Substances/ Devices   
This trial is being conducted under Investigational New Drug (IND) applicatio n # 128487 – IND 
Sponsor: Deanna Green, MD; all relevant FDA regulations will be followed.    
Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) capsules from Biotechpharmacal will be used. Each capsule has 
50,000 International Units of Vitamin D3. Each participant will be provi ded with 250,000 IU 
Vitamin D3 (5 capsules) regardless of age, sex or 25OHD level.   
  
The dosage of 250,000 IU Vitamin D3 has been shown to be safe and effective in raising the 
25OHD level in adult patients with CF and dosages higher than this have been sh own to be safe 
and effective at raising 25OHD levels in pediatric patients as young as 36 months old with 
dosages of 100,000 IU Vitamin D3 in addition to pediatric patients 12 years old receiving 
400,000 IU Vitamin D3 as a one -time dosage without any adver se events, including 
hypercalcemia.

Serious Adverse Experien ces (SAE): An SAE is defined as any AE that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
• Death;

Page 12 of 18  • Life-threatening adverse experience;  
• In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the participant or require intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed.  
  
For this study, important medical events that will be reported as an SAE per protocol also 
include:  
If at any time >10% of the participants experience hypercalcemia, accrual will be held 
pending safety analysis and will be restarted only with the approval  of the Data Safety 
Monitoring Board.   
A hypercalcemia level with serum calcium measure of > 13.5 mg/dL  requiring 
hospitalization and treatment.   
  
The following additional demographic and clinical information will be collected at baseline for 
each participant: Age, gender, pancreatic status (pancreatic insufficiency or pancreatic 
sufficiency), brand of daily vitamin, prescribed dosage and amount of v itamin D3 in prescribed 
daily dosage. Qualitative data on the appropriateness of study materials and reasons for 
nonparticipation and attrition will also be collected to inform future improvement in study 
materials and recruitment and retention strategies.   
  
Demographic and clinical characteristics of participants will be summarized using counts and 
percentages for categorical variables and mean and standard deviation or median and range for 
continuous variables. The mean and corresponding standard deviati on of serum calcium level 
one-week after administration of the high dose of vitamin D3 as well as the proportion and 95% 
confidence interval of participants with elevated serum calcium levels for age will be calculated.   
  
Feasibility and efficacy paramet ers including recruitment rate, retention, response percentages to 
initial and follow up questionnaires and proportion of participants with serum 25OHD level >30 
ng/mL at the end of the study will be calculated with the corresponding  
95% confidence interv als. All adverse events and study related adverse events will be 
summarized using counts and percentages.  
  
The aim of the study is to determine safety and feasibility of a single high dose (250,000 IU) oral 
vitamin D3 for the treatment of vitamin D insuf ficiency/deficiency in pediatric cystic fibrosis 
patients. The study is therefore not powered to detect a difference in a clinically important 
endpoint. We intend to consecutively enroll 30 patients in the study. A sample size of 30 should 
be sufficient to  determine the safety and feasibility and to also estimate the parameters needed to 
perform a definitive sample size and power estimation of a large -scale RCT if safety and 
feasibility are shown in the current study. An appropriate sample size and power ca lculation 
based on the parameters obtained in this study will be presented in a future large -scale RCT 
protocol.

Page 13 of 18  Early Stopping Rules:   
1. Participants who experience hypercalcemia as defined by a serum calcium greater than 
13.5 mg/dL or with a spot urine  calcium to creatinine ratio >2 times ULN will be allowed 
to stop the study and resume standard of care of treatment of their vitamin D 
insufficiency and will be required to receive  treatment for their severe hypercalcemia 
(defined below in section 10 und er “steps taken to minimize the risks”).  
2. Participants who experience a 25OHD level as defined by a level of >100 ng/mL will 
continue to be followed in the study and be monitored for hypercalcemia or 
hypercalciuria with the study protocol.    
  
 10.  Risks :  
Risks of the trial include:  
a. Venipuncture risks at baseline, 1 week, 3 mo, 6 mo, & 12 mo;   
b. Swallowing risks at baseline;  
c. risk of hypervitaminosis D at 3 mo, 6 mo, & 12 mo;   
d. risk of hypercalcemia at 1 week, 3 mo, 6 mo, & 12 mo;  
e. risk of renal sto nes at 1 week, 3 mo, 6 mo, & 12 mo;  
f. risk of continued vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency regardless of treatment throughout 
the study duration;  
g. Other minor risks associated with the trial include upset stomach (nausea) and taking a 
vitamin supplement by mouth.  
  
Steps taken to minimize the risks:  
a. Standard precautions will be used with other venipuncture occurrences;  
b. Patients will be monitored as they are administered their one -time, oral, high dose 
vitamin D in CF Clinic. They will be provided with wat er to take it with by mouth;  
c. To minimize the risk of hypervitaminosis D and hypercalcemia, the participants are 
having their serum levels of 25OHD, calcium and phosphorus monitored in the study. 
Participants with an elevated serum calcium will be called a nd queried about symptoms 
of hypercalcemia as well as instructed to stop any calcium containing supplements, any 
vitamin D containing supplements, and to limit foods containing calcium from their diet.  
d. In the event of hypervitaminosis D, hypercalcemia, an d/or hyperphosphatemia, Dr. 
Green, study Principal Investigator, will be notified as soon as possible. She will evaluate 
the event and decide on the appropriate action for further testing and/ or referral. Subjects 
with calcium levels >ULN for age will req uire a spot urine calcium to creatinine ratio.  
Those with Grade 4 severity will require further intervention.   
1. Grade 1 severity:  corrected serum calcium of >ULN – 11.5 mg/dL   
2. Grade 2 severity:  corrected serum calcium of > 11.5 -12.5 mg/dL   
3. Grade 3 severity: corrected serum calcium >12.5 - 13.5 mg/dL   
4. Grade 4 severity or severe hypercalcemia corrected serum calcium of >13.5 
mg/dL. If subjects are found to have grade 4 severity or severe hypercalcemia, 
they will be treated as follows (16, 17):

mL/hour that is then adjusted to maintain the urine output at 100 to 150 
mL/hour   
b. Administration of calcitonin (4 IU/kg) and repeat measurement of serum 
calcium in several hours.   
If a hypocalcemic response is noted, then the patient is 
calcitoninsensitive and the calcitonin can be repeated every 6 to 12 
hours (4 to 8 IU/kg). We typically administer calcitonin (along with a 
bisphosphonate) in patients with calcium >14 mg/dL who are a lso 
symptomatic.   
c. The concurrent administration of a bisphosphonate, such as zoledronic 
acid or pamidronate, per institutional guidelines.  
  
Significant reduction in serum calcium levels should be seen within 12 -48 hours of 
administration of saline plus calcitonin  
  
During the study, we may obtain research data about the participant’s health. If there are 
unexpected findings from our research that are important to their health and should be discussed 
with them and or their family, we will notify them.  
  
Patient data will be stored for research purposes as a HIPAA defined limited data set in a secure, 
password protected web -based electronic data capture (EDC) system. Each patient will be 
assigned a unique Participant ID number in the EDC system. Access to the EDC system will be 
restricted to those users identified as part of the research study t eam and permission will be 
granted based on levels of access deemed necessary for their role. Data extractions as well as 
modifications or edits to data will be logged appropriately to adhere to audit trail requirements. 
No financial risks to participants have been identified.  
  
 11.  Benefits  
Previous studies of a high dose of vitamin D3, in adults with CF, have shown that they have a 
decrease in markers of inflammation, specifically interleukin and TNF. Studies have also shown 
that adequate vitamin D ma y help to maintain or improve lung function although this has not 
been proven. Adequate vitamin D is widely known to improve bone mineral density in children 
and adults, with and without CF. It is hoped that this study might provide additional information 
regarding the role of a high dose of vitamin D in relation to sustaining an appropriate serum 
25OHD level for up to 12 months, safely and feasibly.  
  
 12.  Costs   
Labs:   
Serum calcium levels measured at 1 week post administration of the high dose vitamin D3 and at 
the 3 month visit post administration of vitamin D3 will be covered by a grant. The cost of each 
serum calcium measurement will be billed as “research” and will cost approximately $62.64 for 
each draw.

JHMIRB eFormA 01  
 Protocol Template Version 3 Dated: 06/2007    
Page 15 of 18  Serum phosphorus will be measured at baseline, 1 week post administration of the high dose 
vitamin D3 and again at the 3 month visit along with serum calcium and 25OHD. The cost of 
serum phosphorus will be bille d as “research” and is $31.42 per draw and will be covered by a 
grant provided by the ACH foundation.  
  
Spot urine calcium to creatinine ratio levels will be done as a part of the screening process for 
this study as well as if a participant has a serum ca lcium level >ULN. The cost of one spot urine 
calcium to creatinine ratio is $73.52. This will cost approximately $2205.60 for the screening 
purpose of this test for 30 participants.   
  
We will additionally budget the cost of three participants requiring t his test as a measure of 
safety, as this will be 10% of our overall goal number of study participants. Once we have 10% 
of our study participants with hypercalcemia and requiring additional safety testing, the study 
will be held until the DSMB can review..  The cost of three participants requiring this test at week 
1 and at month 3, will cost $441.12 ($73.52 per test).   
  
The cost for the urine pregnancy tests will be about $1.98 per test or $49.63 per box of 25 tests. 
We do not expect to need more than 25 pregnancy tests since these will only be used for female 
participants greater than 8 years old.   
  
25OHD level is a part of the standard of care for pediatric patients with Cystic Fibrosis and will 
be measured for “baseline” measures prior to enrollment i n the study and upon annual exam. 
Therefore, the cost fits within the usual cost to the participant even if they weren’t participating 
in the study. In addition, each time they are required to have it re -measured at 3 mo, 6 mo & 12 
mo it will continue to b e a part of the standard of care for assessing their vitamin D. There will 
be standard costs associated with it that the participant would be paying even if they weren’t 
participating in this study.  
  
Vitamins/Supplements:  
Vitamin D3 water miscible form will be purchased via grant funds from BioTechPharmacal.com 
for $18.00 per 100 capsules of a water soluble and vegetarian vitamin D3 – 50,000 IU per 
capsule (18 cents per capsule or maximum cost per STOSS dosage of 250,000 IU is $0.90).  
  
CF specific vita mins are currently prescribed to all patients upon diagnosis. Therefore, 
participants will already be prescribed these as a part of the standard of care for the nutritional 
management of pediatric patients with CF and pancreatic insufficiency. Patients who  are 
pancreatic sufficient will be on a standard regular multivitamin with minerals as a part of the 
standard of care. Neither of these will accrue additional cost to our center or to the patient.  
  
Other: Support Personnel  
A research coordinator will ac t as a part of the research time. He/she will assist in approaching 
eligible patients to obtain consent for participation in this study, scheduling necessary lab work, 
conducting the 10 -item questionnaire and inputting the necessary data into the Red Cap d atabase

Other: Data Safety Monitoring Board – DSMB  
We will require 3 members for our DSMB, one of which will be the chair person. The first 
DSMB meeting will occur at 50% of participant enrollment, the second meeting when 50% of 
participants have had their 3 -month evaluation (after the  safety endpoints have been evaluated), 
the third meeting when 50% of participants have completed the study a nd the fourth meeting 
when all have completed study.

Protocol Title  A Phase 1 , Open -label, Multicenter Study Evaluating the Safety and 
Tolerability , Biologic Activity, Pharmacodynamics, and 
Pharmacokinetics  of Single and Repeated  Escalating Intravitreal 
Doses  of ICON -1 in Patients with Uveal  Melanoma W ho are Planned 
to Undergo Enucl eation  or Brachytherapy  
Protocol Number  IT-003 
Study Phase  Phase 1 
Study Sites  Approximately 7-10 centers located in the U nited States  
Study Objectives  Primary Objective  
 To evaluate the safety  and tolerability  of single and repeated 
escalating i ntravitreal injections of ICON -1 administered  in 
patients wi th uveal  melanoma  who are planned to undergo  
enucleation  or brachytherapy . 
Secondary Objectives  
 To assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effect 
of ICON -1 in patients with uveal melanoma.  
 To describe preliminary evidence of  the biologic activity  of 
ICON -1 as determined by changes in  visual acuity, and tumor 
size 
Exploratory Objective  
 To explore the prognostic in dicato r of the genetic profile  of 
the tumor  in relation to Tissue Factor  expression and response 
to ICON -1 therapy .    
 To describe preliminary evidence of the biologic activity of 
ICON -1 as determined by changes in  tumor pathology, and 
proteomic analysis of vitreous humor . 
Study Design  This is a phase 1, open -label , sequential -group, multicenter s tudy to 
evaluate the safety and tolerability, biological activity , 
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic activity  of single and 
repeated escalating intravitreal injections  of ICON -1 in patients with 
primary uveal melanoma who  are planned to undergo enucleation  or 
brachytherapy .  
Iconic Therapeutics Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
IT-003 05 September 2016  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 7 of 86 Patients diagnosed with primary uveal melanoma involving the 
posterior uveal tract for which the selected treatment management 
plan is enucleation or brachytherapy may be screened for this study. 
Eligible p atients will be assigned to one of three cohorts  that will be 
enrolled consecutively :  
Cohort 1  (enucleation or brachytherapy) : Single dose of 0.3 mg 
(300 µg/100 µl) ICON -1, (n=2)   
Cohort 2  (enucleation or brachytherapy) : Two doses of 0.3 mg 
(300 µg/100 µl) ICON -1 each administered one week apart , 
(n=3)  
Cohort 3  (enucleation or brachytherapy ): Two doses of 0.6 mg 
(300 µg/100 µl + 300 µg/ 100 µl ) ICON -1 each administered 
one week apart , (n=5)   
Each dose level will be evaluated for clinical safety before escalating 
to the next cohort. Clinical and safety data will be reviewed by the 
IT-003 Safet y Review Committee (SRC)  comprised of at least one  
participating Clinical Investigator and the Iconic T herapeutics 
internal Safety Management Committee. The following ocular 
adverse events (even if non -serious)  are considered A dverse Events 
of Special Interest (AESIs) , and will be reported  by the investigator to 
the sponsor and SRC as appropriate : 
 Ocular in flammatory event of CTCAE Grade ≥ 3  
 Vitreous or retinal hemorrhage event interfering with 
visualization of the tumor or retina of CTCAE Grade ≥ 2  
 Any acute onset treatment -emergent vision -threatening 
condition as assessed by the investigator  
Patient  data will be evaluated by the SRC for the occurrence of ocular 
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) events. An ocular DLT is defined  as 
an ocular inflammatory adverse event of 3+ or more severity or a 
grade 2 or higher unexpected vitreous or retinal hemorrhage 
interfe ring with the visualization of the tumor or retina.   
All patients at a given dose level must complete th eir pre-procedure 
safety assessment  after rece iving their last dose of ICON -1 to enable 
evaluat ion of the safety of th at dose level. For cohorts 1 and 2, if no 
patient s experience a DLT , escalation to the next dose level will take 
place. If no patient s experience  a DLT in cohort 3, then cohort 3 will 
be considered the maxi mum administered dose (MA D). If on e patient 
experiences a DLT  in any cohort , an add itional patient will be 
enrolled and evaluated at that dose level. For cohorts 1 and 2, i f two 
or more patients experi ence a DLT  in the original cohort or the 
expanded cohort, then enrollment in that cohort will be suspended 
Iconic Therapeutics Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
IT-003 05 September 2016  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 8 of 86 and any subsequent cohorts will  not be enrolled . For cohort 3, if two 
or more patients experience a DLT in the original cohort or the 
expanded cohort , then enrollment in the cohort will be suspended and 
the IT -003 Safety Review Committee will examine  the safety data to 
determine if  chan ges are warranted.  
If an AESI  occurs while the patient is at the study center and requires 
clinical management, the patient will remain at the study center 
according to the Investigator’s judgment. The patient will be 
managed according to the routine treatment practices of the study 
center. The patient will complete all subsequent study visits.  
All AESI s, serious adverse events , patient discontinuations and 
pregnancy reports must be reported to Iconic Therapeutics within 24 
hours of the investigator learn ing of the event.  
ICON -1 will be administered on Day 0 for all cohorts, and in addition 
on Day 7 for cohorts 2 and 3 only. Patients will return to the study 
center on Day 1 for a safety follow -up visit (all cohorts) and 1 day 
post Day 7  (cohorts 2 and 3 on ly). All patients will return to the clinic 
for safety, clinical, and imaging assessments prior to the scheduled 
surgical procedure. Patients will have their planned Standard of Care 
surgical procedure (enucleation or brachytherapy ) as early as 4 days 
after the last ICON -1 treatment , and return to the study center 30 days  
post-procedure for follow -up safety assessment s (and ocular  
assessments for brachytherapy patients)  and end of study visit .  
Safety will be evaluated by means of occurrence of adverse events, 
clinical laboratory tests ( serum chemistry, hematology,  coagulation , 
and anti -drug antibody levels (ADA) ), vital signs measurements, 
abbreviated physical examinations, slit -lamp biomicroscopy, 
intraocular pressure (IOP), and dilated ophthalmoscopy.  
Pharmacodynamic and biological activity will be measured by means 
of BCVA by ETDRS, spectral -domain optical coherence tomography 
(sdOCT), color f undus photography (CFP), fluorescein angiography 
(FA), ophthalmic ultrasound, and optionally (according to 
investigator judgment) indocyanine green ( ICG) angiography and 
enhanced -depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI -OCT) . 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) and Pharmacodynamic (PD) markers will be 
evaluated by means of measuring plasma  concentrations of ICON -1, 
serum cytokine levels, circulating tissue factor  (TF), 
immunophenotyping , and circulating tumor DNA (CTDNA) .  
For enucleation patients:  immediately f ollowing the enucleation  
procedure , vitreous humor will be aspirated for intraocular ICON -1 
and proteomic analysis of  TF and cytokine levels. Following the 
clinical site ’s standard of care pathology of the tumor, prepared slides 
and/or tumor block samples will be sent to a central laboratory  for the 
Iconic Therapeutics Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
IT-003 05 September 2016  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 9 of 86 study  for additional study -related pathology evaluation of th e tumor 
(including ICON -1 binding, TF expression, protease activating 
receptors 2 ( PAR2 ) expression, immune infiltrate , and alterations of 
the vasculature ), genetic  profiling , and Exome sequencing  of the 
tumor. Genetic profiling  of the tumor  previously performed with fine 
needle aspiration of the tumor does not require repeated testing.    
For brachytherapy patients:   the plaque placement procedure and 
associated follow -up will be according to the standard of care at each 
site.  
Patients  (or their legally authorized representative) may choose to 
withdraw from the study for any reason at any time without prejudice.  
Study assessments for an Early Termination Visit should be 
conducted in the event a patient  discontinues from the study 
prematurely . 
Study Duration  Enrollment is anticipated to take approximately 9 months and patient 
participatio n will be up to approximately 7-8 weeks  including up to 7 
days for screening, and up to approximately 6 -7 weeks for treatment 
and follow -up.

Study Eye 
Determination  The study eye is defined  as the eye that meets all of the inclusion 
criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.  
Investigational 
Product  The investigational product is human Immuno -conjugate 1 ( ICON -1). 
ICON -1 is a recombinant fusion protein  that targe ts and binds to the 
aberrantly expressed  Tissue F actor in retina l disease , tumors and 
supporting stroma (vasculature, infiltrating mononuclea r cells). It is a 
dimeric antibody -like protein  with a molecular weight of 157 kDa ; 
each monomer has two functional domains joined by a linker. The 
targeting domain of ICON -1 is a mutated FVIIa protein conjugated to 
an Fc effector moiety of a human IgG1 im muno globulin .   
ICON -1 is supplied in single -use glass vials containing 0.28 mL of a 
sterile solution of ICON -1 at a concentration of 3 mg/mL in 15 mM 
HEPES , 150 mM NaC l, 25 mM Arginine, pH 7.4 with 0.01% of 
Polysorbate -80 and 5 mM CaCl 2. 
Test Article 
Adm inistration  Patients will be enrolled in  one of three cohorts :  
 0.3 mg (300  µg/100  µl) ICON -1 administered on Day 0  
 0.3 mg (3 00 µg/10 0 µl) ICON -1 administered on Day 0 and 
Day 7  
 0.6 mg (300  µg/100  µl + 300 µg/100 µl ) ICON -1 administered 
on Day 0 and Day 7  
Using aseptic technique , ICON -1 will be administered by first 
withdrawing vial contents through a 5 -micron 19 -gauge filter needle 
attached to a 1 -cc tuberculin or Luer Lock syringe and then replacing 
the filter needle with a 30 -gauge x ½ inch needle for i ntravitreal 
injection.  Adequate topical anesthesia and broad -spectrum 
microbicide will be given prior to injection.   
IOP will be measured before and aft er each injection . For cohort 3, 
the second intravitreal injection will be administered the same day 
following stabilization of IOP to the pre -injection level (i.e., within 5 
mmHg of the pre -injection IOP) and a minimum of 30 minutes after 
the first injection.

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 23 of 86 8 INTRODUCTION  
8.1 Background  
Ocular melanoma (OM) is the second most common primary malignant melanoma in adults and 
leads to significant mortality and ocular morbidity [1]. About 95% of OM tumors can be 
described as Uve al Melanoma (UM), which develop in the melanocytes (pigment cells) of the 
eye and primarily affect the choroid, iris and ciliary body of the uveal tract [2,3]. Using data 
from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program the mean age -adjusted 
incidence of UM in the US is estimated to be 5.1 per million . An estimated 2,000 new cases of 
UM are diagnosed each year (2,4). In Europe the rate of new cases ranges from over 2 per 
million in Spain and Italy to over 6 per million in northern European countries  [5,6]. 
Current Therapies and  Unmet Therapeutic Need  
Standard -of-Care (SOC) for OM is currently radiation therapy  or surgical r emoval of the eye 
(enucleation ).  There are no chemotherapy agents or targeted biologics approved by the FDA for 
treatment of OM.  Small tumors (<10 mm in diameter and <2 mm in height) are often observed 
until growth is documented. Symptomatic patients wit h medium or large tumors usually receive 
some form of radiation, either plaque radiotherapy (brachytherapy) or proton beam radiation  [2]. 
However, th ese radioactive therapies are highly invasive and lead to further complications 
including retinopathy, cataracts, glaucoma and significant vision loss. For large tumors 
enucleation is usually performed. Thus, there is a need for treatment of OM that avoids the  loss 
of an eye or the acute and chronic complications of radiation, while still preserving sight.  
Neither radiation nor enucleation affects the rate at which metastatic disease occurs [7]. While 
local recurrence in the eye is rare, five - and ten -year rates of distant metastasis of 25 and 34 
percent have been reported [8] and nearly half of all ocular melanomas will eventually develop 
distant metastasis , primarily in the liver , with lung and bone marrow the other sites. Once 
metastases have occurred, median survival is between 6 and 12 months. In fact, approximately 
50 percen t of all patients will die of metastatic disease within 10 years following diagnosis, 
despite early diagnosis of the primary tumor, successful local treatment, and close follow -up [9]. 
There is an urgent need for new therapeutic strategies for OM that are not only less or non -
invasive, but that also have a potential to slow the onset of metastas es.  
Prognostic Markers in Uveal  Melanoma  
Proper assessment of the extent of disease and propensity for metastasis is one of the major 
challenges in the current management of UM.  For example, UM is not only a localized ocular 
disease; circulating  tumor  cells (C TCs) have been observed as early as initial diagnosis [10].  In 
uveal  melanoma patients, the presence of tyrosinase RNA in the peripheral blood was found to 
be associated with the stage of disease an d predicted disease progression in patients with early as 
well as advanced melanoma [11,12,13]. In fact, the presence of tyrosinase or MelanA /MART1 
transcripts is an independent prognostic factor in patients with high -risk primary UM [14,15,16]. 
However, as with cutaneous melanoma  [17], multiple markers will likely be needed to increase 
the sensitivity of tumor cell detection, i.e. micrometastasis, in UM.

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 24 of 86 The Molecular Pathogenesis of Uveal Melanoma  
Uveal melanoma harbors early activating mutations in GNAQ or GNA11 found in 80 percen t of 
primary uveal melanomas [18].  Mutations in BRCA1 -associated protein -1 (BAP1) and splicing 
factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) occur later in tumor progression and are mutually exclusive [19]. 
Ciliary  body tumor location has also been associated with monos omy 3 and gains in 
chromosome 8 , both  molecular markers of poor prognosis [20]. 
Uveal Melanomas Classificat ion 
Type 1  Low Risk of Metastasis or Type 2 High Risk of Metastasis are based on gene expression 
profile. Genes that discriminate class 1 (low -risk) from class 2 (high -risk) include highl y 
significant clusters of down -regulated genes on chromosome 3 and up -regulated genes on 
chromosome 8q [21]. Tumors have begun to be classified as having low (class 1) or high (class 
2) metastatic potential, depending on the e xpression of 15 genes [22]. 
Why Target Tissue Factor in Uveal  Melanoma  
Tissue Factor is a 46kd 263 amino acid single chain transmembrane glycoprotein. Tissue Factor 
plays a key role in health and disease . In normal homeostasis it is involved in the initiation of 
coagulation via its external domain and mediation of pro -inflammatory pathways via extra and 
intracellular signaling . In tumor biology it has been show n to trigger angiogenesis, tumor growth 
and metastasis , and promote an inflammatory  immune environment (via extra - and intracellular 
signaling) .   
Two studies support the role of TF in UM. Direct evidence comes from Walker et al who 
showed TF was expressed at elevated levels in cell lines of uveal melanoma compared with 
normal uveal melanocytes by several techniques including Western blotting, RNAase protection 
and Reverse Transcription PCR [23].  In another study, Van Raamsdonk et al found that 83% of 
the 713 uveal melanomas they analyzed had somatic mutations in GNAQ or GNA11, both of 
which are genes coding for the alpha subunit of G prot eins. They concluded that GNAQ and 
GNA11 are activated in a MET -PI3K -dependent manner, and are significant contributors to the 
development of UM [18]. Activation of  the MET -P13K pathway has been shown to increase TF 
expression in cancer ( Figure 1) [24].

(Figure 1  from Han et al. Journal of Hematology & Oncology 2014,7:54)   
Molecular Basis for Tissue Factor Signaling in Tumorigenesis and Metastasis  
1) TF regulates tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis. The TF/Vll  complex initiates many of its 
activities by activation of Protease Activated Receptors (PAR2) ( Figure 2). The TF/Vll/PAR2 
complex can lead to activation of enzymatic  pathways (PKC, MAPK, P13K) regulating cell 
proliferation as well as inhibition of apoptosis by prevention of activation of caspase 3  [25]. 
2) TF promotes tumor an giogenesis and metastasis . Blood vessels in tumor tissues are essential 
for tumor progression and neovasculatu re is a prerequisite for blood -borne metastasis. 
TF/FVIIa/PAR2 induces the production of proangiogenic factors (VEGF) and migration 
promoting fact ors such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), cysteine -rich 61 (Cyr61), CXCL1 
and IL -8 [26]. TF exhibits its pro -metastatic characteristics in part by initiating the pro -coagulant 
cascade in the tumor microenvironment, including thrombin formation, fibrin generation and 
platelet activation. This fibrin -platelet “clot” formation is essential for generating a shield around 
tumor cells to facilitate the spread of tumo r cells and the escape of newly formed 
micrometastasis  from natural killer (NK) cell -mediated cytolysis [27].

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 26 of 86 Figure 2: Function of TF in Cancer Progression  
 
 
Immuno -oncology:  TF can modulate immune responses within the tumor microenvironment. 
Once thrombin is generated, it can directly cleave complement component C5 to produce C5a 
and C5b. C5a has a pro -tumor effect via recruiting myeloid derived suppressor cells to the tumor 
microenvironment, resulting in an immunosuppressive milieu [28]. 
Increased TF expression by cancer cells and supporting stroma leads to  the secretion of a variety 
of chemokines, cytokines  and to the accumulation of Type 2 macrophage s (TAMs) within the 
tumor. Tumor -associated macrophages (TAMs) actively promote tumor growth by supporting 
the recruitment and development of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Tumor 
associated macrophages (Type 2 macrophages) produce high levels of  IL-10, TGF -beta and low 
levels of IL -12. Type 1 macrophages produce low levels of IL -10 and high levels of IL -12.   
Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are characterized by the ability to suppress cytotoxic 
functions of T cells and NK cells  - a key m echanism of tumor defense. MDSCs originate from 
myeloid progenitor cells and are immature cells that do not differentiate into granulocytes, 
macrophages, or dendritic cells (DCs).  
Figure 2. Function of TF in cancer progression.  TF forms TF/FVIIa complex and subsequently induce PAR 
signaling us ing GPR alpha, beta, gamma (G protein coupled receptors). PKC is phosphorylated by activated PAR 
complex, which leads to p -PKC translocation. PAR can also induce MAPK and PI3K activation, both of which 
trigger pro -tumor effects, such as proliferation, angi ogenesis and metastasis. Binding to activator protein (AP) can 
also induce c -Jun up regulation and in turn promote tumor progression. Moreover, TF binding to ABP -280 leads 
to actin modulation, resulting in tumor cells metastasis. As TF binds to integrin re ceptor and enhances the ability 
of migration, in turn leading to tumor cell angiogenesis and migration (From Han et al. Journal of Hematology & 
Oncology 2014, 7:54) . 
Iconic Therapeutics Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 27 of 86 In general, human MDSCs are defined as CD11b -positive, CD33 -positive, HLA -DR-negative or 
low, and lineage markers (Lin) (CD3, CD14, CD19, CD56) negative. Multiple tumor -derived 
factors secreted from the tumor and tumor stroma (tumor associated macrophages, fibroblasts 
and vascular endothelium) drive MDSC recruitment and different iation. These tumor - derived 
factors include granulocyte -macrophage colony -stimulating factor (GM -CSF), granulocyte 
colony -stimulating factor (G -SCF), macrophage colony -stimulating factor (M -CSF), IL -1𝛽, IL-6, 
VEGF, I L-13, IL -10, prostaglandin E2. Among t hese factors, GM -CSF and IL -6 may be most 
powerful in inducing MDSCs from bone marrow progenitors. GM -CSF is required for 
recruitment of MDSCs to the tumor microenvironment. Tumor -derived CXCR2 ligands (IL -8, 
CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5) also attract MDSCs to the tumor microenviro nment  [29]. 
ICON -1  
Iconic Therapeutics, Inc. has developed a therapeutic immunoprotein known as ICON -1 to target  
and bind  TF. ICON -1 is a  recombinant fusion protein , an antibody -like protein with a mo lecular 
weight of 157 kDa, that has two functional domains, one targeting and one effector domain 
joined by a linker  (Figure 3). The targeting moiety of ICON -1 is a mutated factor VIIa protein 
and the Fc portion from a human IgG1 immunoglobulin is unchanged and maintains its effector 
function . The mutated VIIa is defective as a clotting signal but retains its specific high affinit y 
for TF. When ICON -1 binds to TF expressed on the surface of cells, the Fc moiety is activated as 
it binds to the Fc receptor on NK cells, initiating cell -mediated cytotoxicity [30]. Secondary 
mechanisms of action that may be involved include complement activation and interference with 
TF int racellular signaling.  
Figure 3: Molecular Structure of ICON -1 
 
 
There are several mechanisms through which ICON -1 is thought to affect tumor growth and 
development. Early pre -clinical work demonstrated the ability of ICON -1 to cause antibody 
dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity of tumor target cells, and vascular endothelium. Other 
mech anisms under investigation include complement mediated cytotoxicity of targeted tissues 
and blockade of TF dependent internal signaling. The therapeutic potential of ICON -1 is derived 
via the FVIIa targeting moiety, I CON -1 binds to the TF expressed on the surface of endothelial

and their function of inducing angiogenesis and mediating inflammat ion. Secondly, the TF -
bound ICO N-1 molecule, through its Fc effector region, signals the immune system to release 
natural killer (NK) cells and initiate cell -mediated cytotoxicity towards the tumor and its 
supporting stroma (vascular endothelium and infiltrating inflammatory cells).  
8.2 Nonclinical Studies

pharmacodynamic s, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxico logy of ICON -1 in 
models of TF overexpression.

observed -adverse -effect -level (NOAEL) were determined. Pharmacokinetics evaluation of 
ICON -1 after intravenous administration in the porcine species determined the half -life of ICON -
1 at 14.1 to 30.6 hours and the NOAEL of 60 μg/kg  [data on file, Iconic Therapeutics] .

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 29 of 86 A standard Tissue Cross -Reactivity (TCR) study was performed to determine if ICON -1 binds to 
normal human tissues and examine  potential toxicities associated with ICON -1 administration.  
The findings from this study suggested that  ICON -1 did not react with normal human tissues, 
when tested at the experimentally -determined optimal concentration (5 μg/mL) or at a 6 -fold 
higher level.  Staining was only observed in the positive control colon carcinoma tumor. Positive 
staining results m ay be indicative of potential toxicities associated with administration of ICON -
1 to humans in vivo . These findings confirm ICON -1 does not interact with normal tissue  [data 
on file, Iconic Therapeutics] . 
Single intravitreal ( IVT) administration of ICON -1 in the rabbit eye induced a mild ocular 
inflammatory response. Repeated dosing in the mini -pig induced a robust immune response and 
resulted in ocular inflammatory reactions, most evident after the second dose. The subcutaneous 
administration of ICON -1 in dogs and monkeys resulted in a robust immune response in anti -
drug antibodies in all animals, as early as 15 days after the drug administration.  
These nonclinical results indicated that a single IVT dose of up to 600 μg of ICON -1 was 
tolerable and safe in mini-pigs. The mutated FVIIa present in the ICON -1 molecule has minimal 
thrombin generation activity. The ocular reactions observed with the repeated IVT dose in mini-
pigs as well as the anti -drug antibody (ADA) response after sub cutaneous administration in dogs 
and monkeys, suggested a species -specific immune response most likely due to the heterologous 
nature of the human protein in the three different species.  
These results were the basis of and supported the initiation of a sin gle IVT ascending dose study 
of ICON -1 in humans, patients with CNV associated with wet AMD.  
Anti-cancer Activity of ICON -1 
TF is overexpressed in the pathological neovasculature of solid cancerous tumors and plays a 
role in tumor growth, tumor angiogenesi s, metastasis, and thrombosis. Previous attempts to 
target TF have resulted in disruption of the clotting cascade, resulting in unacceptable safety 
profiles. ICON -1 has demonstrated activity against  tumors by binding to  TF, as well as 
preliminary safety da ta showing it does not disrupt normal clotting.  
Table 2 lists in vitro  and in vivo  nonclinical studies demonstrating the anti -cancer activity of 
ICON -1. The in vivo studies showed that ICON -1 was safe and effective when administered 
systemically.  
The in vitro  studies suggest that part of the mechanism of action of ICON -1 is due to cell -
dependent cytotoxicity. Cocco et al [ 30] examined the response of chemotherapy -resistant 
primary uterine serous papillary adenocarcinoma (USPC) cell lines to ICON -1 treatment in 
chromium release assays. Using rituximab as a control , USPCs overexpressing TF were shown 
to be highly sensitive to ICON -1 as measured by cell -mediating killing (65.6% ± 3.7%; range 
57.5 - 77.0%, P< 0.001). In contrast, virtually no cytotoxicity against USPCs was observed in 
controls (controls = untreated, n o ICON -1; rituximab treatment).  
When the molecule was tested in animal models of carcinoma, murine ICON -1 (delivered by an 
adenoviral vector) was shown to be effective in SCID -Hu and full murine models against

8.3 Clinical Experience with ICON -1 
In clinical studies conduc ted by Iconic Therapeutics, more than  one hundred  (100) patients  have 
been administered ICON -1 as single  doses,  or repeated doses either as  monotherapy or in 
combination with other therapies.  A first-in-human Phase 1 study  (IT-001) initiated in October 
2010 and completed in July 2012, evaluated administration o f single doses of ICON -1 in 18 
patients with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to  age-related macular degeneration (wet 
AMD). The study population included both treatment -naïve patients and patients previously 
treated w ith chronic anti -VEGF therapy. In an ongoing Phase 2 , randomized, double -masked, 
active -controlled study (IT -002) in pa tients with CNV secondary to AMD , 88 patients have been 
enrolled.  
The Phase 1 s tudy (IT-001) was an open -label , single intravitreal dose,  dose-escalating design. 
There were no control groups in this study. Six patients each were enrolled in one of three 
different cohorts of ICON -1; 60 μg, 150 μg, and 300 μg . The three cohorts were enrolled 
sequentially employing a traditional 3+3 design. The planned maximum adminis tered  dose in 
this study was 300  μg ICON -1. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ICON -1 would be 
identified as the maximum dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients had a confirmed 
significant safety event  (or 300 μg, the  highest dose contemplated in the p rotocol) . At the 
investigator’s discretion, treatment with bevacizumab (Avastin ®) or ranibizumab (Lucentis ®) 
therapy was allowed two weeks after injection of ICON -1 as rescue therapy. Patients could 
receive standard of care anti -VEGF therapy at any time thereafter.  Patients were followed for 
safety and efficacy for 6 months following administration of ICON -1. The primary objective s of 
the study were  to establish a preliminary safety profile  of ascending doses of ICON -1 and to 
determine the MTD that can be  administered by intravitreal injection as measured by the

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 31 of 86 occurrence of ocular and systemic adverse events . Ocular and systemic events were assessed by 
means of vital signs measurement, ophthalmic examinations, intraocular pressure measurement, 
and the pr esence of anti -ICON -1 antibodies.   
The administration of single intravitreal doses of ICON -1 was demonstrated to be safe and well 
tolerated in all three doses  tested . There were no systemic or ocular dose -limiting toxicities and a  
maximum tolerated dose wa s not determined up to the maximum administered dose of 300 μg 
ICON -1. Most frequently reported adverse events were ocular (conjunctival hemorrhage [n=5], 
vitreous floaters [n=3], conjunctival edema [n=3], and signs of macular degeneration [n=3]) and 
commo nly related to the injection procedure or the retinal signs of the underlying AMD. Only 
one adverse event, a case of vitritis in the 300 μg cohort was considered by the Investigator to be 
related to study drug. No retinal or choroidal abnormalities were no ted on clinical examination or 
angiographically. There were no systemic adverse events reported. No significant systemic levels 
of ICON -1 or antibodies to ICON -1 were detected.  Single dose administration of ICON -1 in the 
Phase 1 study demonstrated prelimin ary evidence of biologic activity and pharmacodynamic 
effec t relevant to wet AMD;  clinical improvement in BCVA , associated with a reduction in CRT 
(on OCT) and a decrease of CNV area of leakage (on FA)  in some patients .  
The ongoing Phase 2 study (IT -002) is the first study to examine administration of repeated 
intravitreal doses of ICON -1. Eighty eight (88)  patients ≥50 years of age  with CVN secondary to 
AMD were  enrolled in this  study from approximately 49  centers loca ted in the United States . 
The study was designed to test the safety of repeated intravitr eal injections of 0.3 mg ICON -1 
administered as monotherapy or in combination with ranibizumab (Lucentis ®) compared to 
ranibizumab monotherapy , and to test proof of conc ept by evaluating biologic activity and 
clinical outcomes of the three treatment arms . Patients will receive up to six (6 ) monthly 
intravitreal administrations of study treatment  and followed for safety  and efficacy  through one 
month following administration of  the last intravitreal treatment . Safety is evaluated by means of 
the occurrence of ocular and systemic adverse events, and changes in clinical laboratory tests, 
vital signs and ophthalmic evaluations. In addit ion, the pharmacokinetic and immunogenetic 
evaluation of the presence of ICON -1 in the systemic circulation is being performed. Biologic 
and pharmacodynamic effect  is assessed by means of changes in visual acuity, qualitative and 
quantitative anatomic chan ges to the retina and CNV as measured by sdOCT, FA, fundus 
autofluorescence imaging ( FAF) and CFP.  
Eighty six (86)  patients received three or more doses  of ICON -1 alone, in combination with 
Lucenti s®, or Lucentis ® alone.  Thirteen  SAEs in nine patients  have been reported to date.  There 
are currently no ocular or non -ocular safety events that led to study unmasking. No ocular or 
non-ocular safety signals have emerged to date and the study continues to be conducted as 
planned.  
8.4 Study Rationale  
Uveal melano ma is a life -threatening and devastating  disease chara cterized  by poor overall 
survival and limited therapeutic options resulting  in either the loss of an eye or complications 
leading to  significant vision loss. Data  from preclinical studies , and current a nd ongoing clinical 
studies in wet AMD (described above) support s investigating ICON -1 as a potential ly less

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 32 of 86 invasive therapeutic option  delaying the need for enucleation  as well as possibly prolonging the 
onset of metastases .  
Patients scheduled for enucleation or brachytherapy as treatment of uveal melanoma provide an 
opportunity to examine the clinical safety of intravitreal administration of ICON -1 within a 
tumor environment. Examini ng the excised tissue after enucleation  will allow c onfirmation of 
the extent of TF expression and whether intravitreally administered ICON -1 binds to TF 
expressed  on uveal melanoma tumor cells and supporting stroma (target engagement).  The short 
term biologic response of ICON -1 binding will be examined wi th a comprehensive panel of in -
vitro and in -vivo outcome measures. This study may shed light on the ability of ICON -1 to 
produce cytotoxic damage to the tumor or inhibit tumor growth as shown in earlier pre -clinical 
models of tumor xenografts.  
The dose -escalating design and sample size for this study are  based on the standard accepted 
clinical toxicity evaluation and are  intended to establish a preliminary safety profile of ICON -1 
administered for the first time in patients with uveal melanoma and to provid e preliminary 
evidence of biologic activity in support of additional studies.

10.1 Overa ll Study Design and Plan  
This is a phase 1, open -label, sequential -group, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability, biological activity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic activity of single and 
repeated escalating intravitreal injectio ns of ICON -1 in patients with primary uveal melanoma 
who are planned to undergo enucleation  or brachytherapy .  
Patients diagnosed with primary uveal melanoma involving the posterior uveal tract for which 
the selected treatment management plan is enucleatio n or brachytherapy  may be screened for this 
study. Eligible patients will be assigned to one of three cohorts that will be enrolled 
consecutively:  
Cohort 1  (enucleation or brachytherapy) : Single dose of 0.3 mg (300 µg/100 µl) ICON -1, 
(n=2)   
Cohort 2  (enucleation or brachytherapy) : Two doses of 0.3 mg (300 µg/100 µl) ICON -1 
each administered one week apart , (n=3)  
Cohort 3  (enucleation or brachytherapy ): Two doses of 0.6 mg (300 µg/100 µl + 300 µg/ 
100 µl) ICON -1 each administered one week apart , (n=5)   
Each dose level will be evaluated for clinical safety before escalating to the next cohort. Clinical 
and safety data will be reviewed by the IT -003 Safet y Review Committee (SRC)  comprised of at 
least one  participating Clinical Investigator and the Iconic T herapeutics internal Safety 
Management Committee. The following ocular adverse events (even if non -serious)  are 
considered A dverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) , and will be reported  by the investigator 
to the sponsor and SRC as appropriate : 
 Ocular in flammatory event of CTCAE Grade ≥ 3  
 Vitreous or retinal hemorrhage event interfering with visualization of the tumor or retina 
of CTCAE Grade ≥ 2  
 Any acute onset treatment -emergent vision -threatening condition as assessed by the 
investigator  
Patient  data will be evaluated by the SRC for the occurrence of ocular Dose Limiting Toxicity 
(DLT) events. An ocular DLT is defined  as an ocular inflammatory adverse event of 3+ or more 
severity or a grade 2  or higher unexpected  vitreous or retinal hemorrhage  interferi ng with the 
visualization of the tumor or retina .   
If an AESI  occurs while the patient is at the study center and requires clinical management, the 
patient will remain at the study center according to the Investigator’s judgment. The patient will 
be manag ed according to the routine treatment practices of the study center. The patient will 
complete all subsequent study visits.  
All AESIs , serious adverse events, patient discontinuations and pregnancy reports must be 
reported to Iconic Therapeutics within 24  hours of the investigator learning of the event.

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 35 of 86 ICON -1 will be administered on Day 0 for all cohorts, and in addition on Day 7 for cohorts 2 and 
3 only. Patients will return to the study center on Day 1 for a safety follow -up visit (all cohorts) 
and 1 day post Day 7  (cohorts 2 and 3 only). All patients will return to the clinic for safety, 
clinical, and imaging assessments prior to the scheduled surgical procedure.  Patients will have 
their planned surgical procedure (enucleation or brachytherapy  plaque pl acement ) as early as  4 
days after the last ICON -1 treatment,  and return to the study center 30 days post-procedure  for 
follow -up safety  assessments ( and ocular assessment s for brachytherapy patients) and end of 
study visit.  
Safety will be evaluated by mea ns of occurrence of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests 
(serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and plasma anti-drug antibody levels (ADA)), vital 
signs measurements, abbreviated physical examinations, slit -lamp biomicroscopy, intraocular 
pressure  (IOP), and dilated ophthalmoscopy. Pharmacodynamic and biological activity will be 
measured by means of BCVA by ETDRS, spectral -domain optical coherence tomography 
(sdOCT), color f undus photography (CFP), fluorescein angiography (FA), ophthalmic 
ultrasoun d, and optionally (according to investigator judgment) ICG angiography, and enhanced -
depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI -OCT) . Pharmacokinetic (PK) and 
Pharmacodynamic (PD) markers will be evaluated by means of measuring plasma  concentrations 
of ICON -1, serum cytokine levels, circulating tissue factor (TF) , immunophenotyping  and 
circulating tumor DNA (CTDNA) .  
For enucleation patients:  immediately f ollowing the enucleation  procedure , vitreous  humor 
will be aspirated for intraocu lar ICON -1 and proteomic analysis of TF  and cytokine levels. 
Following the clinical site ’s standard of care pathology of the tumor, prepared slides and /or 
tumor block samples will be sent to a central laboratory  for additional study -related pathology 
evalu ation of the tumor (including ICON -1 binding,  TF and PAR2 expression, immune inf iltrate  
and alterations of the vasculature ), genetic profiling , and Exome sequencing  of the tumor. 
Genetic profiling of the tumor previously performed with fine needle aspiration of the tumor 
does not require repeated testing .     
For brachytherapy patients:  the plaque placement procedure and  associated follow -up will be 
according to the standard of care at each site .      
Patients  (or their legally authorized representative) may choose to withdraw from the study for 
any reason at any time without prejudice.  Study assessments for an Early Termination Visit 
should be conducted in the event a patient  discontinues from the study prema turely.

Approximately 7-10 centers located in the US  will participate in this study.   
10.3 Discussion of Study Design  
In this Phase 1 study ICON -1 will be intravitreally administered for the first time in patients with 
uveal melanoma. The starting dose of ICON -1 (300 µg/100 µl)  is the maximum dose 
administered in the Phase 1  single IVT administration  study , and the  ongoing Phase 2  repeated 
IVT administration  study in patients with CNV secondary to AMD . As this dose has been 
administered to approximately sixty ( 60) patients and  found to be well tolerated to date, a cohort 
of two patients which may be expanded to thre e patients is thought to be sufficient to make a 
determination to escalate to the subsequent higher dose level of two doses of 0.3 mg ( 300 µg/100 
µl) ICON -1 administered one week apart .  The cohort size is increased  (cohort 2; n=3, cohort 3; 
n=5), as the dose and volume is escalated  in subsequent cohorts .  Each of these cohorts may be 
expanded by one patient in the event of a DLT. A toxicity rate of one third or less in a cohort is 
within the accepted clinically observed toxicity standards  to establ ish a preliminary safety profile 
of ICON -1 administered in patients with uveal melanoma  and to support additional studies.  In 
this study, the maximum administered dose will not exceed 0.6 mg ( 300 µg/100 µl + 300 µg/100 
µl) ICON -1. 
Pharmacodynami c and biolo gic activity markers are utilized to explore preliminary evidence of 
activity with respect to target engagement (ICON -1 binding to TF in the tumor) as measured by 
tissue staining of the tumor and supporting stroma within the enucleated eye,  assessment of 
immune infiltrate in the tumor,  measurement of TF  and PAR2  dependent cytokines/chemokines 
in blood, TF and cytokine levels in vitreous humor, and changes in tumor size and volume as 
well as changes in BCVA by ETDRS.  Ophthalmic ultrasound is utilized to assess and measure 
changes in the size of the ocular tumor. Ophthalmic imaging including sdOCT, EDI-OCT, FA, 
ICGA, and C FP are utilized for measuring and evaluating  changes in vasculature , in the 
anatomic layers of the re tina, choroid, and ocul ar tumor  and the associated pathology of the 
lesions ( such as exudation) .  
The study duration, including a  one to two week  dosing period  prior to a scheduled enucleation 
or plaque placement procedure is considered an adequate period to assess sa fety, PK an d 
preliminary pharmacodynamic and bio logic activity without delaying or interfering with standa rd 
of care treatment for uveal melanoma . 
10.4 Appropriateness of Measurements  
The primary aim for data analyses in this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of 
escalating doses of ICON -1 administered in patients with uveal melanoma. The choice of safety 
and biological  activity parameters to be evaluated in this stud y refle ct experience in pre clinical  
studies , the Phase 1  study in patients with wet  AMD, and the ongoing phase 2  study  in patients

generally recognized as reliable, accurate , and relevant.  Validated clinical bioanalytical assays 
will be used for this purpose.

12.1 Study Drug Dosage and  Administration  
12.1.1  Investigational Product ( ICON -1) 
The investigational product is human Immuno -conjugate 1 ( ICON -1). ICON -1 is a recombinant 
fusion protein  that tar gets and binds to the aberrantly expressed  Tissu e Factor (TF) . It is a 
dimeric antibody -like protein; each monomer has two functional domains joined by a linker. The 
molecular weight is 157 kDa. The targeting domain of ICON -1 is a mutated FVIIa protein 
conjugated to an Fc effector moiety of a human IgG1 immuno globuli n.   
 
12.1.2  Test Article Administration  
Patie nts will be enrolled in one of three cohorts :  
 0.3 mg (300  µg/100  µl) ICON -1 administered on Day 0  
 0.3 mg (3 00 µg/10 0 µl) ICON -1 administered on Day 0 and Day 7  
 0.6 mg (300  µg/100  µl + 300 µg/100 µl ) ICON -1 administered on Day 0 and Day 7  
Using aseptic technique , ICON -1 will be administered by first withdrawing vial contents through 
a 5-micron 19 -gauge filter needle attached to a 1 -cc tuberculin or Luer Lock syringe and then 
replacing the filter needle with a 30-gauge x ½ inch needle for the intravitreal injection. 
Adequate topical anesthesia and broad -spectrum microbicide w ill be given prior to injection .   
IOP will be measured before and after each in travitreal  injection .  
For Cohort 3,  the second intravitreal injection  will be administered the same day following 
stabilization of IOP to the pre -injection level (i.e., within 5 mmHg of the pre -injection IOP) and 
a minimum of 30 minutes after the first injection.   
12.2 Study Drug Packaging, Labeling  and Sto rage  
ICON -1 will be provided by the Sponsor and is supplied in single -use glass vials containing 0.28 
mL of a sterile solution of ICON -1 at a concentration of 3 mg /mL in 15 mM HEPES, 150 mM 
NaCl, 25 mM Arginine, pH 7.4 with 0.01% of Polysorbate -80 and 5 mM  CaCl 2.  
Vials of ICON -1 will be shipped frozen on dry ice and should be stored frozen at ≤ -60ºC  until 
just before use.  Temporary storage is permitted at -20ºC for up to 60 days . ICON -1 vials should 
be thawed by leaving at room temperature for approximately 10 -15 minutes prior to 
administration. Verify that the study drug is completely thawed by taking the vial and gently 
swirling it. ICON -1 may NOT be refrozen once it has been thawed. Time between thawing and 
administration should be as min imal as possible and should not exceed 4 hours.  Vials of ICON -1 
are for single -use only .

IT-003 05 September 2016  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 42 of 86 12.3 Selection of Dose s and Timing of Dose s  
The starting dose of ICON -1 was selected based on the results of preclinical efficacy and 
toxicology studies, a phase 1 study of single IVT administration and a n ongoing  phase 2 study  of 
repeated IVT administration  in patients with CNV secondary to AMD. The highest dose tested 
was 0.3 mg ICON -1 administered by intravitreal injection , and repeated doses up to 6 monthly 
doses per patient were found to be well tolerated in all patients to date. A maximum tolerated 
dose was not determined in the phase 1 study. In the phase 2 clinical study 300 µg/100 µl ICON -
1 is being administered intrav itreally followed by 0.5 mg/50 µl  ranibizumab  after 30 minutes, a 
total injection volume of 150 µl. A total injection volume of 200  µl for cohort 3 is supported by a 
preclinical study in mini -pigs where three cycles of 600 µg ICON -1 were administered as tw o 
doses of 300 µg/100 µl each , two days apart (see Section 8.1 for information regarding the 
preclinical, Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies) .  
12.4 Criteria for Dose -Escalation  and Stopping Rules  
Eligible patients will be assigned to one of three cohorts that will be enrolled consecutively:  
Cohort 1 (enucleatio n or brachytherapy) : Single dose of 0.3 mg (300 µg/100 µl) ICON -1, 
(n=2)   
Cohort 2  (enucleation or brach ytherapy) : Two  doses of 0.3 mg (300 µg/100 µl) ICON -1 
each administered one week apart , (n=3)  
Cohort 3  (enucleation or brachytherapy ): Two  doses of 0.6 mg (300 µg/100 µl + 300 µg/ 
100 µl) ICON -1 each administered one week apart , (n=5)   
Each dose level wi ll be evaluated for clinical safety before escalating to the next cohort. Clinical 
and safety data will be reviewed by the IT -003 Safety Review Committee comprised of at least 
one participating Clinical Investigator and the Icon ic Therapeutics internal Safety Management 
Committee. Patients will be evaluated for the occurrence of ocular Dose Limiting Toxicity 
(DLT) events. An ocular DLT is defined as an ocular inflammatory adverse event of 3+ or more 
severity or a grade 2  or higher unexpected  vitreous or retinal hemorrhage  interfering with the 
visualization of the tumor or retina .  
All patients at a given dose level must complete their pre-procedure  safety assessment  after 
receiving their last dose of ICON -1, to enable evaluat ion of  the safety of th at dose level. For 
cohorts 1 and 2, i f no patients experience a DLT , escalation to the next dose level will take place. 
If no patients experience a DLT  in cohort 3 , then cohort 3 will be considered the maximum 
administered  dose (MA D).  
If one patient experiences a DLT  in any cohort , an additional patient will be enrolled and 
evaluated at that dose level.  
For cohorts 1 and 2, i f two or more patients experi ence a DLT  in the original cohort or the 
expanded cohort, then enrollment in that cohort will be suspended , any subsequent cohorts will 
not be enrolled.  For cohort 3, if two or more patients experience a DLT in the original cohort or 
the expanded cohort , then enrollment in the cohort will be suspended and the IT -003 Safety 
Review C ommittee will examine  the safety data to determine  if changes are warranted .

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 43 of 86 A maximum of three patients may  be enrolled in cohort 1, a maximum of four patients may  be 
enrolled in cohort 2, an d a maximum of six patients may  be enrolled in cohort 3.  
12.5 Measurement of Study Drug  Compliance  
All study treatment will be admini stered by the Investig ator at each clinical site. The date  and 
time of study treatment must be documented for each subject in the source record. Treatment 
assignment and dose must be do cumented in records with access restricted to authorized study 
personnel  only.   
12.6 Study Drug  Accountability  
The Investigator or designee is responsible  for maintaining accurate rec ords of study drug 
supplies. Reasons for any departure from the expected disp ensing regimen must be recorded. 
Study drug may not be used for any other purpose other than that described in the protocol. All 
study drug supplies and accountability records must be stored in a secure location with limited 
access restricted to authorized  study personnel  only. 
All vials of study drug will be recorded on a Drug Accountability Log accounting for all vials 
received, administered, not used, and destroyed. Drug Accountability will be performed by a 
Study Monitor during site visits. Once reconci led, study drug will be returned to the sponsor or 
destroyed at the site , as directed by the sponsor . If the study drug is to be destroyed at the site, i t 
is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure arrangements have been made for appropriate 
destructio n according to applicable regulations, guidelines and procedures. Appropriate records 
of the destruction must be maintained.  
12.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
All medications (prescription, over -the-counter (OTC) and herbal)  and nutritional supplements  
taken b y a subject from 30 days prior to Screenin g through the completion of the study  will be 
recorded . Changes in the dosing and/or  frequency of concomitant medication must be captured 
with new start and stop dates indicating the previou s and current doses/freq uencies . 
Use of two or more concomitant anticoagulant treatments (direct thrombin inhibitor class of 
drugs such as Coumadin (warfarin), Pradaxa (dabigatran), and Xarelto (rivaroxaban)) is 
prohibited. Aspirin is not considered an anticoagulant treatment in this study. Concomitant 
treatment with  one chronic anticoagulant (e.g., patients with a history of 
cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases [events] or hospitalization due to such conditions) is not 
prohibited . 
Use of treatment for concomitant metastatic  disease is allowed during the study.  
Use of topical ocular anti -glaucoma medications is allowed during the study.  
Use of any investigational product or  device within 30  days before Screening through  the 
comple tion of the study is prohibited .

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 44 of 86 The Medical M onitor should be notified before prohibited medication or therapy is administered 
unless the safety of the patient requires immediate action. In the event of an emergency, any 
needed medications or therapies may be prescribed without prior  approval but the  Medical 
Monitor must be notified of the use immediately thereafter.  The decision to administer a 
prohibited medication or therapy should be done with the safety of the patient as the primary 
consideration. If permissibility of a specific medication or the rapy is in question, the Investigator 
should contact the Medical Monitor.  
12.8 Other Study  Supplies  
Additional supplies for administering study treatment intravitreal injections will include 1-cc 
tuberculin syringes, 5-micron 19 -gauge x 1 -1/2 inch filter needle s for withdrawal of t he study 
drug vial contents , and 30-gauge x ½ inch needle s for intravitreal injection s of ICON -1.

13.1 Subject Identification Numbers  
Patient s will be enrolled in  one of three cohorts  following confirmation  from the study Medical 
Monitor . Each patient will be assigned a unique Screening Number after informed consent is 
obtained. The Screening Number will be used as the Subject Number throughout the study .  
13.2 Enrollment and Method of Assigning Patients  to Treat ment Arms  
This is an open -label, sequential -group, multicenter study. The Investigator will evaluate the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria to determine patient eligibility for entry into the study. When a 
potential patient is identified, the investigator must contact the Medical Monitor at  Iconic 
Therapeutics to confirm availability in the cohort . 
The Sponsor, Investigator, research staff and participants will know the treatment that is being 
administered as well as the cohort  assignment. Cohort 1 (single dose of 0.3 mg ICON -1) will be 
enrolled fir st, followed by cohort 2 (two  doses of 0.3 mg ICON -1 administered one week apart), 
and then cohort 3  (two doses of 0.6 mg ICON -1 administered one week apart). Clinical and 
safety  data will be reviewed by the IT -003 Safety Review Committee after all patients in a cohort 
have completed their pre -procedure safety assessment visit  before enrolling patients into 
subsequ ent cohorts .

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 53 of 86 14.9 Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits may be necessary due to AEs or other reasons. The Investigator may examin e 
a patient  as often as is medic ally necessary while the patient  is enrolled in the study. Any follow -
up that is performed to monitor patient safety should be recorded  as an Unscheduled Visit . 
14.10  Patient  Withdrawal from Treatment or Study  
14.10.1  Handling of Withdrawals  
Patients  (or their legally authorized repre sentative) may choose to withdraw from the study for 
any reason at any time without prejudice . The study assessments for the Early Terminati on Visit 
should be conducted in the event a patient  discontinues from the study prematurely.  If a patient  
withdraws from the study, he or she may not reenter the study.  
The Princi pal Investigator or the Sponsor may withdraw a patient  from the study for any of the 
following reasons:  
 Adverse event  
 Prohibited therapy ( patient  requires concomitant medication or a medical procedure 
prohibited by the protocol ) 
 Subject noncompliance ( patient  does not adhere to the requirements specified by the 
protocol ) 
 Subject improper entry ( patient  was enrolled in the study but did not meet the  eligibility 
criteria ) 
 Subject withdrawal of consent  
 Pregnancy ( patient  becomes pregnant ) 
 Lost to follow -up 
 Death  
At the time of withdrawal, the Principal  Investigator should advise the patient  of the other 
available options. When a patient  is withdrawn from the study for any reason, the reason(s) for 
withdrawal will be recorded in the eCRF. For any patient  who withdraws due to an AE, the 
reason for withdrawal must be recorded as an AE and not any other reason. Whenever possible, 
all patient s who withdraw from the study prematurely will undergo assessments listed for the 
Early Termination  visit.  
If a patient  fails to return for a scheduled visit, it is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator 
or designee to document all efforts to contact the patient and to determine the reason the patient  
did not return.  If a patient  cannot be contacted with 3 documented telephone call a ttempts ,

withdrawal of consent or an AE), the reason for discontinuation will be recorded as “lost to 
follow -up”. The date that the certified letter was mailed will be considered the date of study 
withdrawal.  
In the event of a patient  death during the study, the date of death (a s listed on the death 
certificate) will be used as the date of study withdrawal.  
It is vital to obtain follow -up data on any patient  who is withdrawn due to an AE. In such cases, 
every effort must be made to undertake protocol -specified safety follow -up pr ocedures.  
The Medical Monitor should be notified promptly when a patient  is withdrawn.  
The Sponsor may terminate  the study at any time for clinical or administrative reasons and may 
discontinue participation by an individual Investigator or site for poor enrollment or 
noncompliance.  
14.10.2  Replacements  
Patients who discontinue from the study prior to the pre-procedure safety evaluation fol lowing 
their last injection may  be replaced.  
14.10.3  Sponsor or Regulatory Agency Termination of the Study  
Although the Sponsor intends to complete the study, the right is reserved to discontinue the study 
at any time for clinical or administrative reasons, or if required by the local regulatory authority.

This section describes the study assessment procedures. Se e Study Flowchart and Assessments  
(Section 21.1 - Appendix A) for timing of each assessment.  
15.1 Informed Consent  
Each site will be required to obtain IRB/EC approval of the ICF. Before any study specific 
procedures are performed, the investigator o r designee will provide the subject or the subject’s 
legally authorized representative with a copy of the current IRB/EC approved ICF and allow 
adequate time for review and t he opportunity to ask any questions regarding the study and/or 
ICF. The Investigator should answer all questions to the best of his ability and to the satisfaction 
of the subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative before performing any stud y visit 
assessments.  The ICF should be signed and dated by the subject or subject’s legally authorized 
representative, the Investigator or his designee, and witness (where applicable) before any study 
specific procedures are performed.  
The consenting proce ss must b e conducted in accordance with  ICH GCP and local regulatory 
and/or IRB/EC requirements. A copy of the signed and dated ICF should be given to the subject 
or the subject’s legally authorized representative and a copy should be maintained in the 
subject’s medical records. The consenting process should be documented in the subject’s source 
record including the names of persons participating in the discussions and a brief summary of 
what was discussed including questions and responses.  
If the protocol is amended or new safety information becomes available, and revisions are 
required to the ICF, the subject or subject’s legally authorized representative will be required to 
sign the updated IRB/EC approved ICF.  
If a subject or subject’s legally authorized  representative withdraws consent at any time the date 
and time and details of the discussion should be recorded in the subject’ s source record along 
with the names of the persons participating in the discussion.   
15.2 Eligibility Assessment  
The Investigator mu st contact the study Medical Monitor when a potential patient is identified 
for the  study to ensure there is space in the cohort. Screening assessments will be used to 
determin e eligibility  before enrolling  a patient  in the study cohort . 
15.3 Demographic Data  
Demographic data will be recorded including date of birth, gender, race and ethnicity.  
15.4 Medical, Surgical, and Ocular History  
Medical history will be recorded and should elicit all major illnesses , diagnoses, and surgeri es 
for the patient . Ocular history wi ll also  be recorded and should be specific to which eye as 
appropriate.

Prior and Concomitant Therapy taken from 30 days prior to Screening through the last study visit  
will be recorded . The patient ’s source record should incl ude start and stop dates, dose, route, 
frequency, and indication.  
15.6 Vital Signs  
Vital signs should be taken when the patient  is adequately rested (after the patient  has been 
resting in a seated position for at least 5 minutes). Vital signs measurements include blood 
pressure (systolic and diastolic in millimeter of mercury (mmHg)), heart rate (beats/minute), 
respiratory rate (breaths/minute), and temperature (◦C).  
15.7 Abbreviated Physical Examination  
Abbreviated physical examination should include at a minimum assessments of general 
appearance, cardiovascular, respiratory, neck/HEENT  (head, eyes, ears, nose and throat), and 
dermatologic. Height and weight will be measured  at Screening only. Additional assessments 
should be c ompleted at the judgment of the Investigator.  
15.8 Best-corrected Visual Acuity  
Best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) will be measured for each eye, pre -treatment prior to 
dilating eyes, using standard Early T reatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) -like retro -
illuminated charts. BCVA will be recorded as the total letter score in each eye.  
Visual acuity testing  will be performed by qualified  site personnel , and should occur before any 
examination requiring contact with the eye. In order to provide standardization and well -
controlled measurements of BCVA during the study, all measurements at a single site must be 
consistently done using the same lighting conditions, correction, chart type, and measurement 
procedure for an individual  patient throughout the study.  
A study specific refraction and BCVA testing protocol will be provided in a separate BCVA 
testing and imaging procedures manual.  
15.9 Slit-lamp Biomicroscopy  
Slit-lamp biomicroscopy will be performed for each eye by qualified site personnel . Slit-lamp 
biomicroscopy, including magnification, will be performed without dilation of the pupil and 
consistent with standard clinical practice. The patient will be seated during the examination. This 
procedure should  be conducted in the same manner for all patients and will include an 
assessment of each of the following as normal or abnormal:  
 Eyelids  
 Conjunctiva  
 Cornea  
 Anterior chamber

 Lens  
All abnormal findings that are clinically significant will be described. A change from normal to 
abnormal for any biomicroscopic variable will be considered clinically significant.  
15.10  Intraocular Pressure  
At each study visit IOP w ill be measured  according to routine clinical practice  using contact 
tonometry  (e.g. Goldmann  Applanation, Tono -Pen). It is recommended that the same instrument 
be used  throughout the duration of the study for each patient. At injection visits, IOP will be 
measured in both eyes before the injection by qualified site personnel , and in the study eye only 
after intravitreal  injection  (in Cohort 3, IOP will be measured in the study eye following each of 
the two injections) . Measurements will be recorded in mmHg (e.g., 19 mmHg).  At the 1 day 
post-treatment  visits, a single IOP measu rement will be performed in the study eye only. At other 
study visits  IOP will be measured  in both eyes by qualified site personnel.  Elevated IOP should 
be clinically managed in accordance with routine clinical  care of the practice and in accordance 
with investigator judgment.     
The tonometer must be calibrated for accuracy before the first patient  in the study at a given site 
undergoes the first examination, and continue to be performed in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s specifications until the last patient  at the site has exited the study.   
15.11  Dilated Ophthalmoscopy

tumor is performed prior to plaque placement for genetic profile testing , the results of that testing 
will be recorded . 
15.22  Evaluation of Adverse E vents  
Adverse events (AEs) will be monitored continuously during the study from the time that the 
subject has provided written informed consent through the subject’s last day of study 
participation. A Es may be reported spontaneously by the subject, discovered by Investigator or 
study staff through questioning, or  observed through physical examination or other means. It is 
the responsibility of the Investigator to assess and document all A Es that occur during the course 
of the study, regardless of the causal relationship with the study drug.  
The following information will be collected for all A Es and recorded on the subject’s source 
document and AE eCRF:  
 Event description (diagnosis preferred, if unknown, reco rd the signs/symptoms)  
 Onset and resolution dates  
 Severity (intensity)  
 Frequency (intermittency)  
 Relationship to study drug (causality) as determined by the Investigator  
 Seriousness  
 Action taken with study drug  
 Corrective action taken  
 Outcome  
15.22.1  Definition  of an Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  
Iconic Therapeutics Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
IT-003 05 September 2016  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 62 of 86 An AE can the refore be:  
 Any unfavorable and unintended medical diagnosis, sign or symptom  
 Any new undesirable medical occurrence or unfavorable or unintended change in a pre -
existing condition that occurs during or after study treatment  
 Laboratory abnormality, vital s ign or ophthalmic assessment that is assessed as clinically 
significant and different from baseline (e.g., requiring discontinuation of study treatment, 
specific treatment, or a change in subject management). If possible, changes in laboratory 
results or c hanges in vital signs that meet the definition of an AE should be reported as a 
medical diagnosis rather than as the abnormal value (e.g., “hypertension” rather than 
“blood pressure increased”).  
The following are special considerations when determining an d reporting A Es: 
 Whenever possible, the Investigator should group signs or symptoms that constitute a 
single diagnosis under a single AE term (e.g., “cough, rhinitis, and sneezing” might be 
grouped together as “upper respiratory tract infection”).  
 Pre-existing conditions are not considered A Es unless the condition worsens (increase in 
frequency, severity or specificity) during or following study drug administration. 
Fluctuations in a pre -existing condition should be assessed by the Investigator, and those 
that fall within the limits of expected fluctuations for the disease state, and are not 
assessed as worsening of the disease, should not be considered A Es. Any change assessed 
as clinically significant worsening of the disease from baseline must be documen ted as an 
AE. 
 Elective surgery (including the planned enucleation surgery or brachytherapy , and 
associated inpatient hospitalization , as applicable ) or routine diagnostic procedures are 
not considered A Es. However, an untoward medical event occurring durin g the pre -
scheduled elective surgery or diagnostic procedure should be recorded as an AE.  
 Death itself is not considered an AE; it is instead the outcome of an AE.  
 Pregnancy is not considered an AE, but it is an important medical event that must be 
followe d up as described in Section 15.22.8 . 
 For cohort 3, i f the IOP in the study eye following the first intravitreal injection does not 
stabilize sufficiently to the pre-injection level (i.e., within 5  mmHg of the pre -injection 
IOP) to perf orm the second intravitreal  injection , the change in IOP should be reported as 
an AE.  
 For cohort 3, e levated IOP in the study eye following the first intravitreal injection s hould 
be considered an AE if : (1) two or more follow -up IOP measurements are required to 
demonstrate stabilization to the pre -injection level (i.e., within 5 mmHg of the pre -
injection value), thereby delaying the time of the second intravitreal  injection;  or (2) 
interventional therapy is required to return IOP to within 5 mm Hg of the pre -injection 
value.  
Iconic Therapeutics Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
IT-003 05 September 2016  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 63 of 86 A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is any AE with an onset from any time after the patient  has 
received study drug  through 30 days after the last dose of study drug , whether or not it is 
considered causally related to the study drug.   
15.22.2  Serious Adverse Event  
All A Es will be assessed as either serious or non -serious. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any 
event that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death  
 Life-threatening (i.e., if in the view of the Investigator or Sponsor, the event’s occurrence 
placed the subject at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe).  
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
(Hospitalization for elective surgery for a pre -existing condition or for surgery planned 
before study entry is not considered an SAE.)  
 A persistent or significant disability /incapacity (permanent or substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to perform normal life functions). This definition is not intended to 
include experiences of relatively minor or temporary medical significance.  
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect (an A E that occurs in the child or fetus of a subject 
exposed to study drug prior to conception or during pregnancy).  
Important medical event or serious medical condition that does not meet any of the above criteria 
may be considered an SAE if, based upon appro priate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
15.22.3  AE Severity  
The severity of an AE should be determined by the intensity of the AE and will be assessed using 
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 4.03 (June 14, 2010)  Eye Disorders section . 
Table 3:  CTCAE Grading  
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or dia gnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 64 of 86 Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; 
limiting self care ADL**.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death related to AE.  
 
Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the 
telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, usin g the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden  
15.22.4  Study Drug Causality  
The Investigator will assess the relationship of the AE to the study drug as either “Related” or 
“Not Related”. The following should be taken into consideration when assessing SAE ca usality:  
 Positive temporal relationship to study drug, such as if the study drug was withdrawn and 
the AE resolved or the event recurred after re -introduction.  
 If there is a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with an underlying or 
concomitant  illness.  
 Possible association with previous or concomitant therapy.  
 No temporal relationship to the study drug and/or a more likely alternative etiology 
exists.  
 If the AE is directly related to study procedures or lack of efficacy.  
15.22.5  Adverse Events of Speci al Interest (AESIs)  
AESIs  are events of medical and scientific concern specific to the investigational product, for 
which ongoing monitoring and rapid communications by the investigator to the sponsor and 
Safet y Review Committee is appropriate. Ocular adve rse events that qualify as an AESI (even if 
non-serious) include the following:  
 Ocular inflammatory event of CTCAE  Grade ≥ 3  
 Vitreous or retinal hemorrhage event interfering with visualization of the tumor or retina 
of CTCAE Grade ≥ 2  
 Any acute onset trea tment -emergent vision -threatening condition as assessed by the 
investigator

IT-003 05 September 2016  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 65 of 86 15.22.6  Adverse Event Reporting Procedures  
The occurrence of A Es should be sought by non -direct questioning of the subject at each 
scheduled or unscheduled study visit. At each visit, study personnel should ask the following 
question: “Have you had any problems since your last visit?” A Es may also be detected when 
they are volunteered by the subject during and between visits or through physical examination, 
or other assessments. All A Es (serious and non -serious) reported by the subject will be reviewed 
by a qualified physician participating in the study and must be recorded on the subject’s source 
documents and AE eCRF.  
An AE that is classified as “serious” requires expeditious handling and reporting to the Sponsor 
or designee within 24 hours of site notification to comply with regulatory requirements.  
All SAEs  and AESIs , whether or not related to study drug, must be reported immediately to the 
Sponsor or designee by entering the SAE /AES I information directly into the electronic data 
capture (EDC) system (AE eCRF)  within 24 hours after the Investigator becomes aware of the 
event.  
Note that any SAEs that occur after the subject has provided written informed consent but before 
administrati on of study drug and are considered related to a protocol procedure must also be 
reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours after the Investigator’s awareness of the 
event.  
Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully d ocument an SAE before 
reporting the event to the Sponsor  or designee . If only limited information is initially available, 
follow -up information regarding the SAE is  required. Additional relevant information such as 
hospital records, laboratory test results , discharge summaries  and/or autopsy reports should be 
provided as soon as these are available.  These  SAE follow -up documents should  be uploaded 
into the EDC system for informational purposes; however, if a document  cannot be uploaded , it 
should be submitt ed to  Iconic Therapeutics Drug Safety :

15.22.7  Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Agencies  
An AE, whether serious or non -serious, is considered “unexpected” if the event is not reported in 
the clinical safety section of the reference document (e.g., Investigator Brochure or Package 
Insert) or if the event is of greater severity or frequency than is reported in the reference 
document.  
Iconic Therapeutics Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
IT-003 05 September 2016  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 66 of 86 Expedited SAE reports are those SAEs that are both unexpected based on the reference 
document and considered related to the study drug (i.e., the relationship c annot be ruled out). 
The Sponsor will determine which SAEs qualify for expedited reporting.  
Reports of those SAEs that qualify for expedited reporting submitted to regulatory agencies in 
accordance with applicable local regulation (e.g., 21 Code of Federa l Regulations [CFR] 312.32 
and, as applicable, European Union Directive 2001/83/EC and 2001/20/EC).  
Expedited reports will be also distributed to Investigators. Upon receiving such notices, the 
Investigator must review and retain the notice with the Investigator Brochure and immediately 
submit a copy of this information to the governing IRB/IEC in accordance with institutional 
guidelines and local regulations.  
15.22.8  Pregnancy  
Pregnancy alone is not an AE. However, any report of pregnancy that occurs in a fe male subject  
within 30 days after the subject’s last administration of study drug, and that becomes known to 
the Investigator, must be reported to the Sponsor even if the subject is withdrawn from study.  
If a subject or Investigator suspects that a subjec t may be pregnant prior to study drug 
administration, the study drug administration must be withheld until the results of blood serum 
pregnancy tests are available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive the study 
drug and must not be enro lled in the study. If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is 
receiving study treatment, the study drug must be withheld immediately until the result of a 
pregnancy testing is known. If pregnancy is confirmed, the study drug will be permanently 
discont inued and the subject withdrawn from the study. The Investigator must follow the 
pregnancy to conclusion, and collect data on both maternal and fetal outcome including follow -
up information regarding the course of the pregnancy and perinatal and neonatal o utcomes.  
A Pregnancy Report form will be submitted to the Sponsor, at a minimum, initially and at the 
end of the pregnancy. The Investigator is also encouraged to submit to the Sponsor trimester 
follow up reports during the pregnancy. The outcome of the p regnancy and any complications 
occurring during the pregnancy or the delivery must be reported to the Sponsor.  
A miscarriage or spontaneous abortion will be considered an SAE, and will be reported to the 
Sponsor according to the procedure described in Section 15.22.5 . 
15.22.9  Overdose  
Overdose is defined as any dose higher than the protocol prescribed dose of study drug. 
Occurrences of overdose leading to an AE will be repo rted on the AE eCRF. An overdose 
leading to an SAE will be reported to the Sponsor according to the procedure described in 
Section 15.22.5 .

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 67 of 86 15.22.10  Follow -up of Adverse Eve nts  
Patients with an ongoing SAE will be followed until the event is resolved, the significant 
changes return to baseline, the condition stabilizes, the event is no longer considered clinically 
significant by the Investigator, the patient  withdraws consen t, or the patient  is lost to follow -up. 
This may imply that follow -up will continue after the patient  has left the study and that 
additional investigation may be requested by the Sponsor. If the severity or relationship to study 
drug worsens for an ongoing  SAE, a follow -up SAE report should be sent to the Sponsor within 
24 hours after the Investigator becomes aware of the change in status.  
All non -serious adverse events will be followed through the study exit visit. If a non -serious AE 
is first identified a t the last scheduled study contact, the event will be recorded on the AE eCRF 
with the current status noted, but no further follow -up is required.  
15.22.11  Follow -up of Post -study Serious Adverse Events  
Should the Investigator become aware of a new SAE that occurs within 30 days after the last 
scheduled study contact and the event is determined by the Investigator to be related to the study 
drug, the SAE should be reported to the Sponsor and followed in accordance with the procedures 
described in this protocol.

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 72 of 86 18 DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING  
18.1 Case Report Forms and Source Documents  
As part of the responsibilities assumed by participating in the study, the Investigator agrees to 
maintain detailed and accurate case histories of all study patients . Original data will be recorded 
in the subject’s source documents (which may include medical records, hospital charts, clinic 
charts/notes, diagnostics tests such as x -rays, laboratory tests and ECGs, and electronic 
recordings), and transcri bed onto electronic case report forms (eCRFs) provided by the Sponsor.  
The Investigator agrees to maintain accurate source documentation as part of the case history for 
each subject. Recorded data should be updated/corrected in a manner that does not oblit erate, 
destroy, or render illegible the previous entry (e.g., by drawing a single line through the incorrect 
entry and writing the revision next to the corrected data). An individual who has corrected an 
entry should make clear who made the correction and when, by adding his/her initials and the 
date of the correction.  
Designated site staff must complete the applicable eCRFs as soon as possible after each subject 
visit, and the eCRFs must be available for review at the next scheduled monitoring visit. 
Elect ronic case report form completion guidelines that describe how to appropriately enter data 
into eCRFs from the source documents will be provided to the study sites. If an item is not 
available or is not applicable, this should be indicated. Blank data fiel ds should not be present 
unless otherwise directed.  
Prior to locking the clinical database, the Investigator must review and approve all completed 
eCRFs to verify their accuracy.  
18.2 Monitoring of the Study  
Qualified individuals (CRAs  or Study Monitors ) design ated by the Sponsor will follow the study 
closely, and monitor all aspects of the study according to ICH/ GCP and standard operating 
procedures for compliance with applicable government regulations. The Principal Investigator 
(PI) agrees to allow the CRAs d irect access to study drug accountability records and drug 
supplie s, dispensing and storage areas,  clinical files of the study patients  (including original 
medical records)  and the regulatory files . The PI also agrees to assist the CRAs if requested. The 
Principal Investigator and appropriate site staff are responsible for being present or available for 
consultation during routinely scheduled site visits conducted by the CRAs.  
The CRA will maintain necessary email, telephone, fax, and/or mail contact with the 
Investigators and study site  personnel , and will visit the study sites at periodic intervals. The 
CRA will maintain current personal knowledge of the study through observation, review of study 
records and source documentation, and discussion of the con duct of the study with the 
Investigators and study site staff. During those visits, the CRA will compare the subject data 
entered in the eCRFs against original source documents at the clinical site, and evaluate the 
eCRFs for completeness and accuracy. Dat a that are modified on the eCRFs to resolve any 
discrepancies must be supported by the source documents. The review of subject medical records 
Iconic Therapeutics Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
IT-003 05 September 2016  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 73 of 86 will be performed in a manner to ensure that subject confidentiality is adequately maintained. 
Further details of  the study monitoring will be outlined in a separate Monitoring Plan.  
18.3 Data Management  
Data management for this study will be contracted to a Contract Research Organization (CRO) 
designated by the Sponsor. All data management procedures will be detailed in separate, 
specifically identified documents that collectively will be referenced as th e Data Management 
Plan (DMP).  
The designated site personnel will transcribe the information required by the protocol onto the 
eCRFs that will be provided using a fully v alidated Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system 
conforming to FDA requirements for the capture of electronic data. The data will be checked for 
missing data or suspect errors upon entry against validation programs, and appropriate flags will 
be displayed on the eCRFs. The Investigator or designee will make the necessary corrections or 
verify the correctness of the data based on these flags. The database will be backed up regularly 
throughout the study by the CRO or EDC vendor.  
Study Monitors representing the Sponsor will review the eCRFs against the source 
documentation at the site for completeness and accuracy, and will discuss the need for further 
corrections with the Investigator or designee. In addition, computerized edit checks a nd manual 
review processes will also be performed by the CRO on an ongoing basis as outlined in the DMP 
until all data clarifications are resolved.  
In order to classify adverse events and concomitant medications, preferred terms will be assigned 
to the or iginal terms entered on the eCRFs using MedDRA and WHO Drug dictionaries, 
respectively.  
After all data are entered and all data queries resolved, the Investigator must certify that the 
subject data are complete and accurate by applying an electronic signa ture to the eCRF study 
completion page. Once all eCRFs for the study are signed and the analysis populations are 
determined and documented, the clinical database will be locked.  
After the clinical database is locked, disks containing electronic copies of a ll applicable subjects’ 
eCRFs will be provided to each Investigator to be maintained on file by the Investigator.  
18.4 Inspection of Records  
Investigators and institutions involved in the study will permit study -related monitoring, audits, 
IRB/IEC review, and r egulatory inspection(s) by providing direct access to all study records. The 
Investigator or study site may be audited by the Sponsor or its representatives and/or regulatory 
agencies at any time. In the event of an audit, the Investigator agrees to allow the Sponsor, 
representatives of the Sponsor, the FDA, or other regulatory agency access to all study records.  
The Sponsor will review case report form data and perform electronic edit checks on the data.  
Iconic Therapeutics Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
IT-003 05 September 2016  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 74 of 86 The Investigator should promptly notify the Sponsor  of any audits scheduled by any regulatory 
authorities and promptly forward copies of any received audit reports to the Sponsor.  
18.5 Study Record Retention  
Government agency regulations and directives require that all study documentation pertaining to 
the cond uct of a clinical study must be retained by the Investigator. Original source documents 
for each subject should  be included in this documentation. Study documentation should be 
retained by the Investigator until notified by the Sponsor in writing that rete ntion is no longer 
necessary. In addition, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor of any change in the location, 
disposition or custody of the study documentation. Study documentation includes study records, 
subject charts/notes, subject medical records,  laboratory tests, and paper or electronic recordings. 
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the Investigator/institution as to when this 
documentation no longer needs to be retained.  
Records containing subject medical information must be hand led in accordance with the 
requirements of the applicable privacy rules and consistent with the terms of the subject 
authorization contained in the ICF for the study. Care should be taken to ensure that such records 
are not shared with any person or for an y purpose not contemplated by the ICF. Furthermore, 
eCRFs and other documents to be transferred to the Sponsor should be completed in strict 
accordance with the instructions provided by the Sponsor, including the instructions regarding 
the coding of subjec t identities.  
Essential study documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region, or at least 2 yea rs have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of 
clinical development of the study drug. These documents should be retained for a longer period, 
however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the 
Sponsor. Should t he Investigator retire, relocate, or for other reasons withdraw from the 
responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred by the Investigator to 
another party who will accept the responsibility. The Sponsor must be notified in writi ng by the 
Investigator of the name and address of the new custodian and receive documented acceptance 
from the new custodian. If requested, the Investigator will provide the Sponsor, applicable 
regulatory agencies, and applicable IRB/IEC with direct access  to original source documents.

1 If there is study drug available at the clinical site, Screening assessments may be conducted on same day as Baseline visit ( Day 0), prior to enrollment and 
intravitreal injection. Informed consent must be obtained before  any study related screening  activity or treatment is undertaken that is not part of routine care.  
2 Cohort 1 does not have Visit 4 or 5 ; the next visit after Visit 3 is Visit 6.  
3 Height and weight measured at Screening only.  
4 IOP measured using routine practice with a calibrated c ontact tonometer. For study eyes, IOP will be measured pre and post injection(s).   
5 Blood samples for PK and PD assessments will be drawn before and 4 hours ±1 hour post injection.  
6 At Early Termination, b lood samples for PK and PD assessments will be drawn if Day 1 PK/PD blood samples were not collected following injection on Day 0.  
7 The surgical  procedure is scheduled independent of this study  according to standard of care clinical management of uveal melanoma per patient’s treating physician 
and is  not a stu dy procedure.   
8 Following enucleation, v itreous humor will be collected for ICON -1 and proteomic analysis of TF  and other cytokine levels. In addition to the pathology standard 
procedures of the clinical site, the study -related pathology s lides  and/or tumor block sample  will be prepared and shipped to a central study laboratory for additional 
evaluations of the tumor (TF expression, ICON -1 binding, immune infiltrate, genetic profiling, and Exome sequencing). Genetic profiling of the tumor previo usly 
performed with fine needle aspiration of the tumor does not require repeated testing.  
9 Ocular assessments for brachytherapy patients only.  
10 Ocular assessments at early termination visit only if early termina tion occurs prior to surgical procedure .

2 Height and weight measured at Screening only.  
3 IOP measured using routine practice with a calibrated contact tonometer. For study eyes, IOP will be measured pre and post in jection (s).   
4 Blood samples for PK and PD assessments will be drawn before and 4 hours ±1 hour post injection (for cohort 3, after the secon d injection).  
5 At Early Termination, b lood samples for PK and PD assessments will be drawn if Day 1 or 1 day post Day 7 t reatment  PK/PD blood samples were not collected 
following injection on Day 0 or Day 7.  
6 For Cohort 3 , the s tudy eye receives  two study drug  injections. The second study drug injection will occur following stabilization of IOP to within 5 mmHg of the 
pre injection measurement and ≥30 minutes after the first injection at the visit.  
7 The surgical  procedure is scheduled independent of this study  according to standard of care clinical management of uveal melanoma per patient’s treating physician 
and is not a stu dy procedure.   
8 Following enucleation,  vitreous humor will be collected for ICON -1 and proteomic analysis of TF  and other cytokine level s. In addition to the pathology standard 
procedures of the clinical site, the study -related pathology s lides and/or tumor block sample  will be prepared and shipped to a central study laboratory for additional 
evaluations of the tumor (TF expression, ICON -1 binding, immune infiltrate, genetic profiling, and Exome sequencing). Genetic profiling of the tumor previously 
performed with fine needle aspiration of the tumor does not require repeated testing.  
9 Ocular assessments for brachytherapy patients only.  
10 Ocular assessments at early termination visit only if early termination occurs prior to surgical procedur e.

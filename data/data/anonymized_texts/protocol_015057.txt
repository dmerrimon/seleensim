Study Title:  
A Phase 3 Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of AR -15512 , a Cold Ther moreceptor  Modula tor, for 
the Treatment of Dry Eye Disease (COMET -3) 
Study Number:  
AR-15512- CS302 
Study Phase:  
3 
Primary Objective(s): 
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of topical ophthalmic 0.003% AR-15512 compared to its vehicle dosed 
twice daily (BID) in subjects with dry eye disease (DED).  
Study Design:  
This will be a Phase 3, multicenter, vehicle -controlled, double -masked, randomized study conducted at 
approximately 20 sites in the United States . All subjects enrolled will have DED. The study will consist of 
Screening (Day -14) and Baseline  (Day 1)  visits as well as follow -up visits at Day  7, Day 14, Day 28 , and 
Day 90 (Study Exit). In addition, there will be a Day 60 dispensing visit.  
All subjects will be exposed to the Controlled Adverse Environment (CAE®) at the Screening visit to assess 
eligibility.  At the end of the Screening visit, all qualified subjects will be assigned to administer AR -15512 
vehicle BID to both eyes for approximately 14 days during the vehicle run -in period. After the vehicle run -in 
period, subjects will be re -evaluated at the Baseline visit for signs and symptoms of DED. Only subjects who 
requalify, based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be enrolled in the study and randomized in a 1:1 ratio 
within each site to receive 0.003% AR-15512  or AR -15512 vehicle to be administered BID as 1 drop in each 
eye for 90 days. Efficacy will be assessed at  the Baseline (Day 1) visit and Day 7, Day 14, Day 28, and 
Day 90. At the end of the Day 90 visit,  subjects will exit the study. Safety assessments will be conducted at 
each study visit.  
Study Populati on: 
This study is anticipated to enroll approximately 460 subjects with DED  so as approximately 414 subjects 
complete Day 90. The anticipated dropout rate is 10%. To achieve this goal, approximately 1500 subjects 
may be screened . 
Key Inclusion Criteria  
Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to enter into the study:  
• Male or female, 30 years of age or older at the Screening visit  
• Have a p revious history of DED, clinician diagnosed or patient reported, within the previous 
6 months prior to the Screening visit 
• Have used and/or desired to use artificial tears for DED symptoms within 2 months prior to the 
Screening visit 
• Both of the following signs of DED in the same eye:  
a. Total corneal fluorescein staining score of ≥ 2 and ≤ 15 based on the modified NEI grading 
scheme, with no one region scoring > 3 in at least 1 eye at the  Screening visit only

fluorescein staining) in at least 1 eye based on the Ora Calibra® grading scale  after the 
90-minute CAE® exposure  
b. Ora Calibra ODS score ≥ 3 at 2 or more consecutive time points in at least 1 eye during 
CAE® exposure within ≤ 20 minutes of entering the CAE® (if a subject  has an ocular  
discomfort rating of 3 at time 0 for an eye, the subject  must report an ocular discomfort 
rating of 4 for 2 consecutive measurements for that eye  within ≤ 20 minutes of entering the 
CAE)  
• Corrected visual acuity equal to or better than logMar  +0.7 (Snellen equivalent equal to or better 
than 20/100), as assessed by Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale in both 
eyes at both the Screening and Baseline visits  
Key Exclusion Criteria

• Vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure)  
• Hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis  
• Adverse events  
• Corrected visual acuity  
• Intraocular pressure  
• Dilated fundus exam  
Statistical Methods:  
Sample Size Determination  
Two hundred two (202) intention -to-treat ( ITT) population subjects (study eyes) per treatment group yields 
99% power to conclude superiority of 0.003% AR -15512 over vehicle in the proportion of subjects ≥ 10  mm 
in unanesthetized Schirmer score on Day 14, assuming a true difference of proportions (AR -15512 vs 
vehicle) of 80% vs 30% and a two- sided alpha = 0.05.  
Additionally, 202 ITT population subjects (study eyes) per treatment group yields 9 9% power to conclude 
superiority of 0.003% AR -15512 over vehicle in the mean change from Baseline  in SANDE score on Day 28 
assuming a true difference (AR -15512 minus vehicle) of -7.9, a common standard deviation of 17.72 , and a 
two-sided alpha = 0.05.  
Accounting for subject discontinuations, approximately 460 total subjects ( 230 per treatment arm) will be 
randomized assuming a dropout rate of 10%.  
 
Primary endpoint 
• Proportion of subjects ≥ 10 mm increase in unanesthetized Schirmer score on Day 14  
 
Secondary endpoints  
• Change from Baseline in SANDE score on Day 28  
• Change from Baseline in  unanesthetized Schirmer score on Day 14 
• Change from Baseline  in SANDE Score on Day 90 
• Change from Baseline  in ODS  - VAS on Day 90 
• Change from Baseline  in Eye Dryness - VAS Day 90

    • Proportion of subjects ≥ 10 mm increase in unanesthetized Schirmer score on Day 90 
• Change from Baseline  in unanesthetized Schirmer score on Day 90 
 
Statistical Analyses  
Analysis of primary efficacy will be based on difference of proportions tests for dichotomous endpoints and 
analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) for change from Baseline  endpoints. Available data only will be used if 
the discontinuation rate is <  5% in each arm ; otherwise, an estimand based on multiple imputation will b e 
used for the primary analysis.  
Analysis of secondary efficacy will be conducted as described for the primary efficacy endpoints, using 
difference of proportions test s or ANCOVA with available data only if the discontinuation rate is < 5% in 
each arm and multiple imputation otherwise. The secondary efficacy endpoints will only be formally tested if 
the endpoint is significant at the α=0.05 level. Testing of the secondary efficacy endpoints will be conducted 
using a fixed -sequence hierarchical strategy.

    1. INTRODUCTION  
AR-15512 is a potent and selective agonist of Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 8 
(TRPM8)  that is being developed for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye 
disease (DED ). 
1.1 Background 
DED is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by a loss of homeostasis 
of the tear film, and accompanied by ocular symptoms, in which tear film instability and 
hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, and neurosensory abnormalities play etiological roles ( Craig 2017). Epidemiological data suggest the prevalence of DED falls 
in the range of 5% to 50% of the global population ≥ 50 years old, depending on the definition of DED that was used (Baudouin 2014, Bron 2014, Rolando 2010, Smith 2007, Stapleton 2017, Uchino 2013).   
DED is broadly attributed to either impaired tear film production or excessive tear film evaporation. Either of these changes to the tear film can compromise the health of the ocular surface with associated epithelial damage, which can adversely affect visual function. This can be experienced as blurred vision and ocular surface discomfort, often described as a 
feeling of dryness, burning, itchiness, or a sandy/gritty sensation. 
Treatment of DED is mainly symptomatic and very few specific pharmacologic therapies are 
currently approved ( Jones 2017) . Artificial tear preparations are generally the first therapy  
considered. Artificial tears are based on lubricating or viscosit y-increasing agents and there is 
limited evidence suggesting that any one type of artificial tear is markedly better than others 
(Doughty 2009). With respect to pharmaceuticals, various strategies exist for targeting the 
underlying ocular inflammation associated with DED with two products ( Restasis
® 
[0.05% cyclosporine ophthalmi c emulsion] and Cequa™ [0.09% cyclosporine ophthalmic 
solution]) indicated for increased tear production in patients with DED and a third , Xiidra® 
(5.0% lifitegrast ophthalmic solution), indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of DED. In addition, a novel cholinergic agonist, delivered nasally (varenicline solution, 
nasal spray 0.03mg [Tyrvaya™]), is approved for the treatment of signs and symptoms of 
DED. The short- term application of topical ocular steroids is also used for acute management 
of DED. 
In recent years, increased attention has been placed on the neuronal regulation of tear 
production. The trigeminal nerve provides the pathway for parasympathetic stimulation of the lacrimal functional unit and sensory stimulation of the cornea and conjunctiva is essential for initiating basal tear production (Belmonte 2015; Belmonte 2017). Reduced corneal 
neuron density and / or dysfunction of the corneal sensory nerves have been hypothesized to contribute to the pathogenesis of DED. The functional types of sensory nerve fibers of the 
cornea are distinguished by their selective expression of different transient receptor potential channels, each of which confers a specific sensitivity to mechanical, thermal, or chemical stimuli.

    Branches of the trigeminal nerve innervating the cornea and lids selectively express cold 
sensitive thermoreceptors, called TRPM8  receptors ( Belmonte 2017, Viana 2011). TRPM8 
receptors are associated with the detection of ocular surface dryness and are activated by 
evaporative cooling and hyperosmolarity leading to regulation of tear production and blink rate (Belmonte 2017, Yang 2017, Yang 2018). In addition, agonists of TRPM8 promote a 
cooling sensation that may be beneficial for reducing ocular discomfort and pain. Taken together, TRMP8 agonists may have a dual role in the potential treatment of DED by both stimulation of tear production and reduction of discomfort ( Abelson 2013).  
AR-15512 is a potent and selective agonist of TRPM8  that has been used as a flavoring  agent 
or adjuvant in the food industry and as cooling agent for chewing gum and candies for several years. AR-15512 was  acquired by Aerie in connection with the acquisition of 
Avizorex Pharma S.L. (“Avizorex”), who began the development of AR-15512 ophtha lmic 
solution.  
When applied topically to the eye, AR-15512 activates cold thermoreceptor nerve terminals 
of the cornea leading to regulation of tear production and blink rate. In addition, a cooling 
sensation may be produced which could be beneficial for reduc tion of ocular discomfort. 
Preclinical and clinical evidence to date support the mechanism of AR -15512 as an agonist of 
TRPM8 and the ability of AR-15512 to modulate corneal nerve impulse activity leading to increased tear production and a reduction of DED symptoms. 
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of AR-15512 is 
provided in the investigator’s brochure (IB).

isk/Benefit Assessment  
AR-15512 has been used as a flavoring agent or adjuvant in the food industry and as a 
cooling agent for chewi ng gum and candies for more than a decade. AR-15512 
(FL-no. 16.123) is generally recognized as safe (GRAS)  as a flavoring agent or adjuvant 
(USFDA/FEMA GRAS  No. 4681) in or on human food products with no safety concerns at 
specified use levels ( EU/EFSA 2014 ; WHO/JECFA No. 2079 ). 
In vitro , in vivo  and ex vivo  studies have also been performed on AR-15512 to demonstrate 
safety , tolerability and n egligible systemic exposure and to characterize the effective dose 
and the regimen of ocular administration of AR-15512 ophthalmic solution. In addition, Aerie has conducted two good laboratory practice ( GLP ) 3-month repeated-dose topical

    ocular toxicity studies of AR- 15512 ophthalmic solution in rabbits on clinical formulations 
and higher dose regimens then reflected in this Phase 3 study.  
DED represents a significant health care burden, contributing to approximately 25% of visits 
to ophthalmic clinics (Gayton 2009, Reddy 2004, Yu 2011) , and can significantly affect a 
patient’s daily activities and quality of life. Studies have shown that DE D interferes with 
reading, driving ability, computer use, work productivity and is associated with increased 
anxiety, stress and depression ( Noor 2018).  
Currently there are few effective treatments for DED. Artificial tears, which are comprised of various polymers and buffering excipients are formulated to soothe and lubricate the ocular surface and are usually the initial option for all DED patients. Artificial tears are generally palliative in nature and do not halt disease progression. With respect to pharmaceuticals, various strategies exist for targeting the underlying ocular inflammation associated with DED, but only one (5% lifitegrast [Xiidra
®]), is indicated for the treatment of the signs and 
symptoms of DED. In addition, a novel cholinergic agonis t, delivered nasally (varenicline 
solution, nasal spray 0.03mg [Tyrvaya™]), is  approved for the treatment of signs and 
symptoms of DED.   
Thus, there is a significant unmet need for an effective topical ocular therapeutic to 
effectively treat the signs and  symptoms of DED. This unmet need in combination with all 
pre-clinical and clinical data collected to date support continu ed development of AR-15512 
as a potential new treatment for DED  with a high overall positive benefit- risk ratio to 
humans.   
2. STUDY O BJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary  Objective (s) 
To evaluate the safety  and efficacy of topical ophthalmic 0.003% AR-15512 compared to its

4.4 Screen Failures 
A screen failure occurs when a participant who consents to participate in the clinical study is not subsequently randomized. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to  
ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards  
of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure det ails, 
eligibility criteria, and any SAE s. Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in 
this study (screen failures) may  be rescreened for eligibility up to one time if there is a 
reasonable possibility, in the Investigator’s opinion, that the patient might meet the eligibility criteria. It is encouraged for the investigator to discuss potential rescreening  with the 
Sponsor. Rescreened  participants should be assigned a new participant number for every 
screening/rescreening  event.

9. Cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide 
Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus 
interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
4.5.4.1 Pregnancy Reporting  
If pregnancy of a subject occurs during the study, the Investigator will notify the Sponsor 
within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. Any subject who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will discontinue study intervention.  
Every attempt will be made to collect data on the  pregnancy with subject permission. The 
investigator will collect follow -up information on the subject and the neonate and the 
information will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., 
spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, c ongenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are 
considered SAEs and will be reported as such.  
5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
Study intervention is defined as any investigational product(s), marketed product(s), placebo, vehicle(s), or medical device(s) intended to be administered to a study participant according 
to the study protocol. 
5.1 Description of Study Interventions  
5.1.1 Investigational Product  
AR-15512 ophthalmic s olution is a  sterile, preservative -free, isotonic, buffered aqueous 
solution containing 0.003 % AR-15512, hypromellose, polyoxyl 35 castor oil, sodium 
dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, and sodium chloride in water ( either purified water or water 
for injection ). The product formulations are adjusted to a pH of approximately 7 with sodium 
hydroxide and are packaged in blow- fill-seal containers of extruded polyethylene. 
 
1 Vasectomized partner  is considered to be a highly effective birth control method providing that the partner is 
the sole sexual partner of the women of childbearing potential and that the vasectomized partner has received a 
medical assessment of the surgical success  
 
2 Sexual abstinence  is considered to be an acceptable method of contraception when defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse durin g the entire period of risk associated with the study interventions. The reliability 
of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject

The product formulation is adjusted to a pH of approximately 7 with sodium hydroxide and is packaged in blow- fill-seal containers of extruded polyethylene. 
AR-15512 vehicle will be provided in masked identical kits, identical to the investigational 
product. 
5.2 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient 
Subjects who qualify at the Screening  visit will be instructed  on proper administration 
procedure to instill 1 drop of AR-15512 vehicle BID to both eyes on Days -14 to -1 ( vehicle 
run-in period) as follows: 1 drop in each eye in the morning (from approximately 7:00h to 
10:00h) and 1 drop in e ach eye in the evening (from approximately 19:00h to 22:00h). A new 
vial should be used for each administration time (both eyes dosed from one vial). Following the vehicle run -in period, those subjects who requalify at the Baseline visit,  will be  
randomize d into two  groups, in a 1:1 ratio  within each site, as follows:  
• 0.003% AR-15512 (n = 230) 
• AR-15512 vehicle (n = 230) 
Subjects will be re -instructed on proper administration procedures at the Baseline visit. 
Subjects will be instructed to administer their randomized study intervention BID to both 
eyes as follows: 1 drop in each eye in the morning (from approximately 7:00h to 10:00h) and 
1 drop in each eye in the evening (from approximately 19:00h to 22:00h). A new vial should be used for each administration  time (both eyes dosed from one vial). At the Screening visit, 
the morning dose  of AR-15512 vehicle will be administered in clinic by the subject under 
site staff supervision. At the Day 1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 90 visits, the “evening” 
(or second) dose of randomized study intervention  will be administered by the site staff, 
thus there will be no “evening” (or second) dose administered by the subjects on these days. All office visits must be arranged at approximately the same time of day ± 1 hour.  
5.3 Method of Assigning Patients to Study Intervention Groups  
All subject s will be centr ally assigned to randomized study intervention using interactive 
response technology (IRT). Before the study is initiated, the log- in information and directions 
for the IRT will be provided to qualified personnel at each site.  
  
AR-15512 Ophthalmic Solution   
Clinical Study Protocol: AR -15512 -CS302, Amendment 2 Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
 
   
Confidential  Page 30 of 81  
    All qualified subjects will b e assigned to receive AR -15512 vehicle BID to both eyes for 
approximately 14 days during the vehicle run-in period. Following the run- in period, all 
subjects who requalify at the Baseline visit (Day 1), will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, within 
each site, to receive 0.003% AR-15512 or AR-15512 vehicle. The IRT will provide the site 
with the specific kit number(s) for each randomized subject at the time of randomization. Sites will dispense the study intervention according to the IRT instructions and the Sch edule 
of Visits and Assessments (Appendix 1).  
5.4 Masking  
During the vehicle run-in period, the subject will be masked. During the randomized study intervention period, the investigator and site staff performing eligibility / efficacy and  safety 
assessments and the subjects will be masked. Subjects will remain masked  during the 
randomized phase. Subjects  will be informed that they all will receive vehicle at some point 
in the study, but the exact timing will not be specified.   
AR-15512 (0.003%) and AR-15512 vehicle will be provided in identical single- use 
blow- fill-seal containers.  
5.5 Unmasking  
A randomization schedule for allocating the study interventions within a site will be prepared 
by an unmasked statistician who is not involved in the day- to-day conduct of the study.
 
Study intervention assignments will be masked to the Investigator, the clinical study team (Sponsor, personnel involved in day- to-day study management, Monitors, Data Managers, 
and Statisticians), and the subjects. Only in case of medical emergency or occurrence of adverse events that warrant unmasking in the opinion of the investigator, will the study intervention assignment(s) be unmasked and made available to the Investigator and the Medical Monitor. In the absence of medical need, the randomization code will not be available to the above personnel until after the study is completed and the database is locked. 
If the Investigator feels it is necessary to unmask a subject’s study intervention assignment 
after an emergency situation, the Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor. Only  after 
consultation with the Medical Monitor will a decision be made as to whether or not the study 
intervention for the subject should be unmasked. The study intervention  assignment will be 
revealed on a subject-by-subject basis, thus leaving the masking on the remaining subjects 
intact.  
5.6 Study Intervention Compliance  
At the Screening visit , the morning dose will be administered in clinic by the subject under 
supervision from site personnel. For the Day 1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 90 visits , 
the “evening” dose will be administered by designated site personnel; all other doses will be administered by the subject. Study intervention compliance will be assessed by site records 
for these treatments .

Clinical Study Protocol: AR -15512 -CS302, Amendment 2 Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
 
   
Confidential  Page 31 of 81  
    The subjects’ used and unused study intervention vials will be collected at each visit from the 
Baseline visit  up to and including the Day 90 ( Exit) visit  to assess dosing  compliance . Dosing 
compliance will be based off the used and unused vial count. If the subject is less than 80% 
or more than 125% compliant with dosing based on the expected number of used and unused 
vials, then the subject will be deemed non- compliant and a protocol deviation must  be 
recorded. Subjects will be instructed on instillation and storage of study intervention at the 
end of each  visit (e xcluding the exit visit), as well as provided written instructions.  
These guidelines will be used by the Investigator for determining the subject’s necessary compliance for the study and for recording deviations from this compliance. 
The study centers will keep an accurate accountability record that specifies the amount of 
study intervention dispensed to each subject, the amount of study intervention returned to the site, and the dates of each . 
5.7 Packaging and Labeling  
Each packaged unit will be labeled with an investigational label with the information required per applicable regulations.  
The products for each study intervention assignment will be packaged into identical randomized intervention kits; each randomized intervention kit will contain one of 2 study 
interventions : 0.003% AR -15512 ophthalmic solution or AR-15512 ophthalmic solution 
vehicle.  
Additional detail is provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
5.8 Storage 
The study intervention  must be dispensed and administered according to the procedures 
prescribed in this protocol and Pharmacy Manual . Only qualified subjects may receive study 
intervention, in accordance with all the applicable regulatory requirements. Only authorized 
staff is allowed to dispense these study interventions. Under normal conditions of handling 
and administration, the study interventions are not expected to pose significant safety risk to 
site staff. Adequate precautions must be taken to avoid direct contact with the study 
intervention. The study interventions will be stored in a secure area under the appropriate 
physical conditions for the product. Access to the study intervention will be limited to authorized site staff only. The study interventions will be stored as directed on the investigational label. The study interventions must  be stored in clinic refrigerated 
(2°C to  8°C/36°F to 46°F) until dispensed to the subject . Temperature of the study 
intervention storage location at the site is to be monitored using a calibrated monitorin g 
device and documented. Study intervention should be removed from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before use. At time of dispensing, the subject will be instructed to store the study 
intervention per details in the Pharmacy Manual and to protect from light (store in carton) as directed on the investigational label. Subjects should be instructed not to freeze the study intervention.

    5.9 Accountability  
5.9.1 Receipt and D isposition of Study Medication   
Study intervention s will be shipped to the Investigator’s site from a central depot. If a 
discrepancy is noted, the appropriate individual at the Sponsor or  designee must be notified 
immediately , in accordance with the Pharmacy Manual . The responsible person (s) for 
dispensing study intervention at the Investigator’s site is the only site staff member(s)  
permitted to distribute study intervention and also has sole responsibility to account for all 
returned used, partially used and unused vials  of study intervention. The study intervention (s) 
must not be used outside this protocol. An Investigational Product Accountability Log will be 
kept at each clinical site.  
5.9.2 Return of S tudy Intervention  
When the study is completed or is terminated by the Sponsor, all study mat erials including 
used and unused study intervention kits / vials will be returned to the Sponsor or their 
designee. Subjects should be instructed to retain all vials  (used , partially used  or unused) of 
study intervention and return them to the clinical site. All study intervention accounting 
procedures must be  completed before the study is considered to be concluded. 
The responsible person(s)  at the Investigator’s site has the sole responsibility to account for 
all used, partially used , and unused study intervention. This site staff member at the 
Investigator’s site will complete a study intervention returns form or equivalent that will be 
signed by the Investigator or designee prior to returning the used and unused study intervention vials to the Sponsor or their designee. 
6. STUDY P ROCEDURES  
6.1 Informed Consent  
Prior to any study procedures, the study will be discussed with each subject, and subjects wishing to participate must give written informed consent. The verbal explanati on of the 
study will cover all the elements specified in the written information provided for the subject. The Investigator will inform the subject of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study, including any discomfort it may entail. The subject must be given every opportunity to clarify any points he/she does not understand and, if necessary, may ask for more information. At the end of the interview, the subject should be given time to reflect. Subjects and/or a legally authorized representative then will be required to sign and date the ICF.  
The ICF must have received approval/favorable review by a properly constituted Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to use. A copy of the signed and dated consent document will be given to each subject. The original signed and dated ICF must be maintained in the study files at the Investigator’s site.

    The Investigator or staff is responsible for ensuring that no subject is exposed to any study 
related examination or activity before th e subject has given written informed consent. 
It should be emphasized that the subject is at liberty to withdraw consent to participate at any time, without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. Subjects who refuse to give, or withdraw, written informed consent may not be included or continued in this study, and should be notified that discontinuation from the study will not impact their subsequent care.  
6.2 Demographics, Medical  and Surgical  History  
Demographic data will be co llected and recorded. Significant medical and ophthalmic history 
will be collected and any current underlying medical/ophthalmic conditions, including those that may have resolved before the Screening  visit, must also be recorded. All relevant 
medical and ophthalmic surgical procedures should be recorded. 
6.3 Prior and Concomitant Medication Assessments 
Any medication (including vaccines, OTC, prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal 
supplements) that the participant is receiving at the time of enrollment or receives during the study must be recorded. P rior medications taken up to at least 90 days prior to the Screening 
visit must also b e recorded. Additional details on prohibited and allowable medications can 
be found in the Supplemental Medication Guide.  
6.4 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
6.4.1 Laboratory Parameters 
A chemistry panel, a complete blood count (hematology and differential), and urinalysis will be performed as described in the Laboratory Manual.  
6.4.2 Sample Collection, Storage and Shipping  
The site staff responsible for collecting the laboratory samples will be identified on the Site 
Authorization and Delegation Log. Details for the preparation and shipment of samples and reference ranges will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
6.4.3 Pregnancy Testing  
Urine  pregnancy tests for women of childbearing potential ( WOCBP; defined in 
Section  4.5.4) are required at Screening, Baseline and Day 90 (Study Exit ) visits. Pregnancy 
tests must be negative for the subject to receive study intervention. 
6.5 Dispensing Study Intervention  
Masked study -related site personnel will be cautioned that any used or unused study 
intervention kits are not to be opened a t the clinical site by the site staff involved in efficacy 
or safety assessments.

6.6 Efficacy Assessments  
6.6.1 Symptom Questionnaire (Visual Analog Scale  (VAS) ) 
Subjects will be asked to rate each of the following DED symptoms (both eyes together), 
over the last 24 hours , each  on a separate VAS: ocular discomfort (ODS) , eye dryness (EDS) , 
 For each VAS, subject s will be asked to place a vertical mark on the horizontal 
line to indicate the level of each symptom, with 0 corresponding to “no symptom” and 
100 corresponding to “maximal symptom”. The assessment line length of each scale will be 100 mm (Figure 2).  Instructions for measuring each subject ’s response on each VAS can be 
found in the Manual of Procedures.

    6.6.2 S
ymptom Assessment in Dry Eye Questionnaire  
The SANDE questionnaire ( Schaumberg 2007 ) is comprise d of 2 unique VAS s to assess the 
frequency and severity of DED symptoms. Subjects will be asked to complete the SANDE to 
rate both the frequency and severity of DED symptoms for both eyes together. Each of the 
two questions will be accompanied by a VAS. The assessment line length of the scale will be 
100 mm and will be similar to the following depiction (Figure 3). H igher scores indicat e 
greater frequency or severity .  
Instructions for measuring each  subject’s response on each VAS can be found in the Manual 
of Procedures. The SANDE  score will be calculated by multiplying the frequency score by 
the severity score and obtaining the square root. The final value must be rounded to the nearest whole number.

Two unanesthetized Schirmer tests will be performed  on both eyes at each of the Baseline 
(Day 1), Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 90 visits.   
Placement and removal of the strips should be performed by the Investigator, sub-
Investigator or designated trained personnel. Reading of the strips post- test, should be 
performed by only the Investigator or sub-Investigator. Every effort should be made to 
ensure the same individual(s) performs this assessment for a given subject at each applicable visit.

6.8.4 Intraocular Pressure  
The IOP must be measured in both eyes only after the biomicroscopic exam is completed and 
must be measured prior to pupil dilation. IOP will be taken by qualified study site personnel 
with the subject seated. Every effort should be made to ensure that the same study site personnel use  the same device for IOP measurement for a given subject. A Goldmann 
applanation tonometer affixed to a slit lamp is the preferred device for IOP measurement. 
6.8.5 Dilated Fundoscopy  
Dilated fundus exams will be performed  in both eyes  using indirect ophthalmoscopy. 
The Investigator will make observations of the vitreous, retina, macula, choroid and optic 
nerve. Observations will be graded as Normal or Abnormal. Abnormal findings that are clinically 
significant (as determined by the I nvestigator that may interfere with study parameters or 
otherwise confound the data) and those that are not clinically significant will be described. An indirect Fundoscopy examination should be performed if retinal disease is detected. 
• Vitreous : Examination should emphasize the visual axis. 
• Retina , Macula, Choroid: Include an observation of the retina and its blood vessels. 
Eyes should be excluded from the study if active inflammation is present.  
• Optic  Nerve:  Significant damage or cupping to the optic nerve should be noted. 
It is recommended t hat tropicamide 1% ophthalmic solution be used to dilate subjects. 
6.9 Adverse Events Assessments  
6.9.1 Performing Adverse Event Assessments  
All AEs occurring during the study, regardless of the assumption of causal relationship, must be documented on the respective eCRF .  
Qualified study staff responsible for assessing AEs will be listed on the Site Authorization and Delegation Log. This includes assessment of AE severity and relationship to treatment. AE information may be volunteered by the subject or solicited by study personnel through non-leading questions.  
Documentation of AEs/adverse reactions will include AE description, start date and stop date, severity, relationship, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome.

Confidential  Page 46 of 81  
    If a disease is known at the time an AE is reported, this diagnosis should be recorded rather 
than listing of individual symptoms. However, if a cluster of symptoms cannot be identified 
as a single diagnosis, each individual event should be reported separately. If a diagnosis is subsequently known, it should be reported as follow-up information. 
When recording an AE, the following information should be provided on the study AE 
eCRF : 
1. Action Taken with Study Intervention: 
• None 
• Study Intervention Discontinued 
• Study Intervention Interrupted  
2. AE Outcome: 
• Fatal  
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved  
• Recovered/Resolved  
• Recovered/Resolved with sequelae  
• Recovering/Resolving 
• Unknown/Lost to follow-up 
6.9.2 Adverse Event Definitions 
The following definitions of terms apply to this section:  
• Adverse event (AE): any untowa rd medical occurrence associated with the administration 
of the study intervention in humans, whether or not considered to be related to the study intervention.  
• Adverse reaction (AR) : any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
administrat ion of the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of Investigational New Drug 
(IND) safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the administration of the drug and the AE. See Section 6.9.5. 
• Life-threatening AE or life -threatening AR : an AE or AR is considered “life- threatening” 
if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or AR that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Serious adverse event (SAE) or serious adverse reaction (SAR): an AE or AR is 
considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any 
of the following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening or sight- threatening AE, subject 
hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial  disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, 
  
AR-15512 Ophthalmic Solution   
Clinical Study Protocol: AR -15512 -CS302, Amendment 2 Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
 
   
Confidential  Page 47 of 81  
    be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not 
result in subject hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as a serious adverse event when the hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization was for an elective surgical procedure or for a preexisting condition (with no increase in severity) .  
• Unexpected AE or unexpected AR: an AE or AR is considered “unexpected” if it is not 
listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an Investigator’s Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general inves tigational plan or 
elsewhere in the current application, as amended. See Section 6.9.6. 
6.9.3 Reporting Adverse Events  
AEs should be documented from the time the subject provides informed consent until subject participation in the study has been completed. If a serious or non -serious AE or adverse 
reaction is unresolved at the time of exit, efforts will be made to follow up until the AE or adverse reaction is resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or there is other 
resolution to the event. These follow-up visits will be documented.  
If an event occurs after informed consent but prior to subject enrollment and the 
commencement of study medication, it should be recorded as an AE. Any change in the health status after commencement of study me dication should be recorded as treatment 
emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ). 
Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.
 
6.9.3.1 AEs and Prior Medical History  
Any medical condition present prior to informed consent which remains unchanged or improved should not be recorded as an AE at subsequent visits. However, an AE should be 
recorded if the frequency, intensity, or the character of a pre -existing  condition worsens 
during the study period beyond what would be expected from the natural progression of that condition.  
Symptoms and signs that are consistent with the natural history of DED are not considered reportable adverse events. Such developments are recorded but are not reportable adverse events.  Worsening of symptoms and signs of DED  should be recorded as an AE or SAE only 
if judged by the investigator to have unexpectedly worsened in severity and/or frequency or 
  
AR-15512 Ophthalmic Solution   
Clinical Study Protocol: AR -15512 -CS302, Amendment 2 Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
 
   
Confidential  Page 48 of 81  
    changed in nature at any time during the study. When recording an unanticipated worsening 
of DED, it is important to convey why the development was unexpected.   
If there is a question as to whether a medical development should be reported as an adverse 
event, the Investigator is recommended to contact the Sponsor for guidance. 
6.9.4 Severity  
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the level of discomfort or the degree of intensity of an AE as determined by the Investigator or reported to them by the subject. The assessment of severity is made irrespective of study medication relationship or seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale:  
• 1 = Mild: present and noticeable, but not distressing, and no disruption of normal daily activities  
• 2 = Moderate: bothersome, discomfort sufficient to possibly reduce or affect normal daily activity  
• 3 = Severe: incapacitating, with inability to work or perform normal daily activity  
A change in increased severity for a reported  AE will require a stop date for the previous 
severity and a new start and stop date for the new severity. For example, a change in severity may go from mild to moderate, or from moderate to severe. In either case, the start and stop dates should be record ed. 
Note: A severe AE is not the same as a serious AE. Seriousness of an AE (NOT severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see Section 6.9.8 for further 
information on SAEs, SARs, and suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions [SUSARs]).   
6.9.5 Relationship  
A relationship between the AE and the study intervention  or study procedure will be 
determined by the Investigator, as applicable, for each AE using these explanations:  
• Not Related: The event is clearly related to other factors such as subject’s clinical condition, therapeutic interventions, concomitant disease, or therapy administered to the subject and does not follow a known response pattern to the product, device, or procedure.  
• Unlikely Related: The event is most probably caused by other etiologies such as subject’s underlying condition, therapeutic intervention, or concomitant therapy; or the delay between adminis tration and the onset of the AE is incompatible with a causal 
relationship. Therefore, there is not a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the product, device, or procedure.

Clinical Study Protocol: AR -15512 -CS302, Amendment 2 Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
 
   
Confidential  Page 49 of 81  
    • Possibly Related: The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence f rom the time of 
study medication administration or study procedure and/or follows a known response 
pattern to the product, device or procedure but could have been produced by other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or  concomitant therapy 
administered to the subject.  
• Related: The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of study medication administration or study procedure and/or follows a known response pattern to the product, device or procedure and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy administered to the subject, and either occurs immediately following study medication administration or procedure, or improves on stopping the study medication, or reappears on repeat exposure, or there is a positive reaction at the application site.
  
6.9.6 Expectedness 
• AEs or ARs are considered “unexpected” if they are not  listed in the Reference Safety 
Information section of the Investigator’s Brochure for AR-15512 or are not  listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or ARs that are mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure as occurring 
with this class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of AR-15512 and are not  specifically mentioned as occurring with the study drug.  
For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the Investigator’s Brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the Investigator’s Brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or ARs that are mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the phar macological properties of the drug but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
• An Investigator must immediately (i.e., within 24 hours from time of awareness) report 
any SAE or SAR (see Section 6.9.2 for definitions) to the Sponsor or its clinical research 
organization ( CRO) representative, whether or not considered drug-related, including 
those listed i n the protocol or Investigator’s Brochure. 
6.9.7 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events 
Clinical laboratory values (other than pregnancy tests results) that are noted as abnormal and 
clinically significant at study exit and that are changes from Screening values will be documented as AEs.

Serious Adverse Reactions 
6.9.8.1 Reporting SAEs or SARs  
An Investigator must immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) report any SAE or SAR 
(see Section  6.9.2 for definitions) to the Sponsor or its CRO representative, whether or not 
considered study intervention-related, including those listed in the protocol or Investigator’s Brochure. The Investigator must use the SAE report form and include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event. The Investigator must report any SAE or SAR that occurs or is observed during the study. In c ase of incomplete 
information, the Investigator must provide follow -up information as soon as possible, again 
using the SAE report form. The email or fax to submit the SAE report is found in Section  6.9.8.3.  
SAE r eports will be evaluated by the Medical Monitor. Regulatory authorities , IRB, and 
Investigators at each of the study sites will be informed as required.   
6.9.8.2 Reporting S uspected  Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs)   
The Investigator must immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) report SUSARs. In the event of 
SUSAR, the site must notify the Medical Monitor (Section 10.2) for the study and submit an 
SAE report form within 24 hours of notification, observation, or occurrence of the SUSAR, whether or not complete information is available. In the case of incomplete information, the Investigator must provide follow-up information as soon as possible using the SAE report form.

    7.4 Unscheduled Visits  
An unscheduled visit may be any visit to the Investigator other than the visits specified in the 
protocol as possibly required for the subject’s ophthalmic condition. 
The investigator will perform all procedures necessary to evaluate the study participant at these visits and record any AEs in the eCRF.  
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE  
The progress of the study will be monitored by on-site, written, and telephone communications between personnel at the Investigator’s site and the Study Monitor. The Investigator will allow the Sponsor or designee and/or representatives of H ealth 
Regulatory Agencies to inspect all eCRFs, subject records (source documents), signed 
consent forms, study medication records (receipt, storage, preparation, and disposition), 
and regulatory files related to this study at mutually convenient times at regular intervals during the study and upon request after the study has been completed.  
The purpose of these visits is to provide the Sponsor and/or Health Regulatory Agency the 
opportunity to evaluate the progress of the study, document compliance with the protocol and 
with regulatory requirements, verify the accuracy and completeness of subject  eCRF s, 
resolve any apparent discrepancies or inconsistencies in the study records, and account for all investigational supplies.  
9. PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1 General Considerations 
Quantitative variables will be summarized using number of subjects (n), mea n, median, 
standard deviation  (SD) , minimum and maximum. Qualitative variables will be summarized 
using counts and percentages.  
All summaries will be presented by treatment group.  
For the purpose of summarization, medical history, concurrent medications, and AEs will be 
coded to MedDRA and WHO Drug dictionaries, as appropriate. 
Baseline measures are defined as the last non -missing measure prior to the initiation of 
randomized study treatment  unless otherwise defined in the SAP.  
Change from Baseline (CFB) will be calculated as post-B aseline result  – Baseline ; treatment 
comparisons will be calculated as AR -15512 – vehicle.  
All primary and secondary analyses will be two-sided at a significance level of 0.05.

    9.2 Unit of Analysis  
Safety endpoints will be analyzed for both eyes. For efficacy endpoints assessed at the eye 
level, the unit of analysis will be the “study eye” as defined in Section  9.3. For efficacy 
endpoints assessed OU, the unit of analysis with be the subject.  
9.3 Study Eye Selection  
The study subject must have at least one eye (the same eye) meeting all the inclusion criteria 
(Section 4.2 ) and none of the exclusion criteria (Section 4.3 ) at both Screening and Baseline 
visits where applicable. Study subjects will be dosed in both eyes. If both eyes are eligible at the time of randomization, the study eye will be defined as the eye with the lower pre -drop 
unanesthetized Schirmer score to be performed at the Baseline visit.  If both eyes still qualify 
and have the same pre- drop unanesthetized Schirmer score, the right eye will be designated 
as the study eye 
9.4 Missi ng Data  
The primary analysis will be completed with available data per subject as specified in 
Estimand 1 from the intent- to-treat ( ITT) population, assuming the overall study 
discontinuation rate is <5% in each arm . If the study discontinuation rate is ≥ 5% in each arm 
then the primary analysis will be based on multiple imputation methodology as specified in Estimand 2, and the available data analyses will become robustness analyses.  
Additional robustness analyses will include repeating the primary analysis on the ITT population imputing missing data as failures for the proportion of subjects with ≥ 10 mm increase in unanesthetized Schirm er score on Day 14 endpoint; using multiple imputation 
methodology under different assumptions of missingness (at random and not at random) each using 30 imputed values; the ITT population imputing missing data using last observation carried forward (LOCF); the ITT population using trimmed means; and the per- protocol (PP) 
population with available data per subject. 
9.5 Hypotheses  
The primary endpoints will be tested as follows:  
H
01: The difference between study eyes treated with AR -15512 (0.003%) and study eyes 
treated with vehicle, in the proportion of subjects with ≥ 10 mm increase in unanesthetized 
Schirmer score on Day 14 = 0. 
H11: The difference between study eyes treated with AR -15512 (0.003%) and study eyes 
treated with vehicle, in the proportion of subjects with ≥ 10 mm increase in unanesthetized 
Schirmer score on Day 14 ≠ 0.

    9.7 D
etermination of Sample Size  
Two hundred two (202) ITT population subjects (study eyes) per treatment group yields 
99% power to conclude superiority of 0.003% AR-15512 over vehicle in the proportion of subjects with ≥ 10 mm increase in unanesthetized Schirmer score on Day 14, assuming a true difference of proportions (AR -15512 vs vehicle) of 80% vs 30% and a two-sided 
alpha = 0.05. 
Additionally, 202 ITT population subjects (study eyes) per treatment group yields 
99% power to conclude superiority of 0.003% AR-15512 over vehicle in the mean change from Baseline in SANDE score on Day 28 assuming a true  difference (AR -15512 minus 
vehicle) of -7.9, a common SD  of 17.72, and a two-sided alpha = 0.05.  
Accounting for subject discontinuations, approximately 460 total subjects (230 per treatment arm) will be randomized assuming a dropout rate of 10%.  
9.8 Analysis Populations  
The following analysis population will be considered. 
9.8.1 Intent -to-Treat Population  
The intent- to-treat (ITT) population includes all randomized subjects. The primary efficacy 
analysis will be performed on the ITT population. Subjects in the ITT will be analyzed as 
randomized. 
9.8.2 Per Protocol Population 
The per protocol (PP) population includes subjects in the ITT population who do not have 
significant protocol deviations likely to seriously affect the primary outcome of the study and 
who com plete the trial through Day 90. Protocol deviations will be assessed prior to database 
lock and unmasking. The PP population will be analyzed using observed data only for efficacy variables. Subjects in the PP population will be analyzed as treated.  
9.8.3 Safety  Population  
The safety population includes all randomized subjects who have received at least one dose of the investigational product. The safety population will be analyzed for all safety assessments. Subjects in the safety population will be analyzed as treated.

    9.9 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Subject demographics including age, sex , race, ethnicity, and iris color will be presented 
using summary statistics (mean, SD, minimum, maximum, and median) or frequency counts 
and percentages as appropriate.  
9.10 Efficacy Analyses 
9.10.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
• Proportion of subjects ≥ 10 mm increase in unanesthetized Schirmer score on Day 14 
9.10.2 Primary Efficacy Analyses 
The primary comparison in this trial will be between AR -15512 (0.003%) and vehicle in the 
ITT population with available data per subject using Estimand 1 below if the overall study discontinuation rate is < 5%. If the discontinuation rate is ≥ 5%, this analysis will be a sensitivity analysis.  
Estimand 1: 
• Population: subjects in the ITT population with DED defined through enrollment 
criteria  
• Endpoint:  
o Proportion of subjects with ≥ 10 mm increase in unanesthetized Schirmer 
score on Day 14 
• Intercurrent event:  
o Discontinuation of investigational products is ignored. [treatment p olicy 
strategy]  
o Non-optimal compliance is ignored. [treatment policy strategy]  
o Withdrawal due to any reason. Missing data not imputed. [hypothetical strategy]  
• Population- level summary:  
o Difference in the proportion of subjects ≥ 10 mm increase in unanest hetized 
Schirmer score on Day 14 between AR-15512 (0.003%) and vehicle  
If the overall study discontinuation rate is ≥ 5% in each arm  then the primary analysis will be 
based on multiple imputation methodology using Estimand 2 below. If the discontinuation rate is < 5%  in each arm, this analysis will be a sensitivity analysis.

fety Endpoints and Analyses  
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Frequencies and percentages of 
treatment- emergent adverse events will be summarized at the subject level by system organ 
class and preferred term for all TEAEs, treatment related TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and TEAEs causing premature discontinuation of study drug by treatment group. An AE is treatment emergent if it occurs or worsens after the first dose of trial treatment. Similar summaries will be presented for all TEAEs by maximal severity. Separate summaries will be performed for ocular and non-ocular TEAEs.  
Other safety endpoints including visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and dilated fundoscopy wi ll be summarized by treatment group and visit using descriptive statistics. 
Changes or shifts from Baseline will also be summarized where appropriate. For assessments 
performed by eye, study eye and fellow eye will be summarized separately.  
In addition, c hanges from Baseline to worst on- treatment value for ocular safety assessments 
will be summarized.

• The Helsinki Declaration ( World Medical Association  2013)  
• US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21 
• International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Consolidated Good Clinical Practice 
Guideline (E6 R2)  
• SOPs of the Sponsor and any other vendors participating in the conduct of the study 
• Obtaining prospective informed consent  
10.5 Subject Information and Consent  
Informed consent must take place before any study specific procedures are initiated. Signed 
and dated written informed consent must be obtained from each subject and/or from the subject’s legal representative prior to enrollment into the study. 
All informed consent forms must be approved for use by the Sponsor and receive approval/favorable opinion from an IRB prior to their use. If the consent form requires 
revision (e.g., due to a protocol amendment or significant new safety information), it is  the 
Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that the amended informed consent is reviewed and approved by the Sponsor prior to submission to the governing IRB and that it is read, signed and dated by all subjects subsequently enrolled in the study as well as those currently enrolled in the study if directed by the IRB. 
10.6 Subject Confidentiality  
The Investigator and his/her staff will maintain all personal subject data collected and 
processed for the purposes of this study using adequate precautions to ensure confidentiality, in accordance with local, state, and country laws and regulations.  
Monitors, auditors and other authorized representatives of Aerie, the IRB approving this 
study, and government regulatory authorities (e.g., FDA) may be granted direct ac cess to the 
study subject’s original medical and study records for verification of the data or clinical study procedures. Access to this information will be permitted to representatives of the aforementioned organizations to the extent permitted by law.  
A report of this study’s results may be published or sent to the appropriate health authorities 
in any country in which the study drug may ultimately be marketed, but subject identities will not be disclosed in these documents. 
10.7 Study Monitoring  
Clinical res earch associates will be responsible for monitoring the study sites and study 
activities. They will contact and visit the Investigator regularly. The actual frequency of 
monitoring visits depends on subject enrollment and on study site performance. Among others, the following items will be reviewed:  
• Study progress 
  
AR-15512 Ophthalmic Solution   
Clinical Study Protocol: AR -15512 -CS302, Amendment 2 Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
 
   
Confidential  Page 70 of 81  
    • Compliance with the protocol 
• Completion of eCRFs  
• Storage and accountability of study intervention  
• Source data verification  
• AE and SAE reporting 
• Essential documents contained within the regulatory binder 
For source data verification (i.e., comparison of eCRF entries with subject records), critical 
data points will be source verified and will include, but not be limited to: subject identification, informed consent and assent, if applicable (procedure, signature, and date), selection criteria, and primary efficacy and safety parameters (i.e., AEs). All other data will 
be subject to risk -based source verification, with specific details outlined in a Monitoring 
Plan.  
10.8 Interactive Response Technology 
Interactive response technology (IRT) is a validated touch-tone phone or web- based system 
that can be used for subject randomization/study intervention request, drug inventory management, emergency unmasking, and by study subjects for recording diary responses. Interactive response technology activities will be performed as described in the IRT User Manual.  
10.9 Case Report Forms and Study Records 
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories that record all observation s and other data pertinent to the investigation on each individual 
administered the study intervention or employed as a control in the investigation. Case 
histories include the case report forms and supporting data including, for example, signed and dated consent forms and medical records including, for example, progress notes of the physician, the individual's hospital chart(s), and the nurses' notes. The case history for each individual shall document that informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study. 
Study data will be recorded via electronic case report forms (eCRF s). Each authorized study 
staff member will receive a unique access account in order to use the Electronic Data Capture 
(EDC) system. Access accounts will not be shared amo ng study staff. Authorized users will 
make entries and/or changes to the eCRF via a secure internet access. Each completed set of eCRFs will be reviewed by the Investigator who will then electronically sign and date the eCRF confirming that data for the su bjects are complete and accurate.  
Source document information should be legible. Recorded data should only be corrected by drawing a single line through the incorrect entry and writing the revision next to the corrected data. The person who has made the correction should place his or her initials as well as the date of the correction next to the correction. Data may not be obliterated by erasure, redaction, or with correction fluid.

    The study records must include a copy of each Investigator's curriculum v itae and medical 
license, completed FDA Form 1572 / Statement of Investigator, each eCRF, subject 
charts/source documents, Investigator's Brochure, Investigator’s Brochure amendments, protocol, protocol amendments, correspondence with the Sponsor and the I RB, IP storage, 
receipts, returns and dispensing records, Delegation of Responsibilities Log, site training records, records of site monitoring, unmasking documentation, AE and SAE reporting, IRB approvals, advertisements, written information provided to s ubjects, and subject completed 
ICFs. If the Investigator moves, withdraws from an investigation, or retires, the responsibility for maintaining the records may be transferred to another person (e.g., Sponsor, other Investigator) who will accept the responsibility. Notice of this transfer, including written acceptance, must be made to and agreed upon by the Sponsor. 
10.10 Protocol Deviations 
Per ICH E6 ( Good Clinical Practice [GCP ]) R2 Section 4.5.1 the Investigator/institution 
should conduct the trial in compliance with the protocol agreed with the Sponsor and, 
if required, by the Regulatory Authority and which was given approval/favorable opinion by 
IRB.  
Protocol waivers or deviations from the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria are not 
allowed because they can potentially jeopardize the scientific integrity of the study regulatory acceptability or subject safety. Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the protocol is essential.  
The site will contact the Sponsor for clarification of inclusion  and/or exclusion criteria as 
needed prior to enrollment of the study subject. The Sponsor or their representative will document clarification requests and responses. If a subject does not meet any of the eligibility criteria, that subject may not be enrolled into the study. 
If the Investigator feels that in his/her clinical judgment, it is necessary to  promptly 
implement reasonable alternatives to, or deviations from, the protocol in consideration of the 
safety of study subjects, the Sponsor is to be notif ied of these alternatives and deviations, 
and the reasons for such changes are to be documented in the study records. The Investigator is to also notify his/her IRB of any such changes. 
If a significant protocol deviation is identified by the Investigator or through site monitoring 
activities an immediate submission to the IRB may be required e.g., 24 or 48 hours (as per 
IRB guidelines). The Sponsor will assess any protocol deviation and decide whether any of these non-compliances should be reported to the relevant regulatory authority as a serious 
breach of GCP and the protocol. If per the relevant regulatory  authorities’ requirements, 
the protocol deviation is not required to be reported immediately but is still required to be notified to the IRB, the spec ific protocol deviation will be added to the annual progress 
report.  
The Sponsor will review, designate, and/or approve all protocol deviations prior to the database lock.

    10.11 Access to Source Documentation  
Monitors, auditors, and other authorized representatives of the Sponsor, the governing 
IRB(s ), the FDA, the Department of Health and Human Services ( DHHS ), and other 
domestic government agencies will be granted direct access to the study subject’s original medical and study records for verification of the data and/or clinical study procedures. Access to this information will be permitted to representatives of the  aforementioned 
organizations to the extent permitted by law. 
10.12 Data Generation and Analysis 
A system of computerized data validation checks will be implemented and applied to the 
database on an ongoing basis . Query reports pertaining to data omissions and discrepancies 
will be forwarded to the clinical Investigator and the Sponsor for resolution. The study database will be updated by the clinical investigator or their staff, in accordance with the resolved query reports. All changes to the study database will be documented. 
Data will be checked per CRO’s SOPs. The database will be locked, and a biostatistician will 
complete the analyses of the data in accordance with the SAP. 
10.13 Retention of Data  
The Investigator’s site and clinical laboratory will retain all re cords related to the study in 
compliance with ICH GCP  Guidelines E6 (R2) section s 4.9.4 and 4.9.5, and appliable local 
regulations. 
Archived versions of the database will be saved by the Sponsor consistent with ICH Good 
Clinical Practices Guidelines E6 (R2 ) section  5.5.11, complying with whichever of the 
requirements is longer.  If for any reason custody of the records must  be transferred , the Sponsor is to be notified in 
writing of any such transfer.  
10.14 Financial Disclosure  
The Principal Investigator and sub-Investigators (as listed on Form FDA 1572) will provide 
financial disclosure information prior to participation in the study. The Principal Investigator 
and any sub-Investigators will notify the Sponsor promptly of any required revision to their financial disclosure status (if applicable) during the term of this study, annually, or at the end 
of the study.  
Under 21 CFR 54 the Investigator/Sub investigator is required to provide the sponsor with 
sufficient accurate financial information to allow for complete disclosure or certification and to update this information if any relevant changes occur during the study and for one yea r 
following its completion .

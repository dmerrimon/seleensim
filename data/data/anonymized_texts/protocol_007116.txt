   3 PRÉCIS  
Background : 
• Wee1 is a tyrosine kinase involved in the phosphorylation and inactivation of cyclin -
dependent kinase 1 (CDK1/CDC2) -bound cyclin B, resulting in G2 cell cycle arrest in 
response to DNA damage to allow time for DNA repair.  Recent preclinical data additionally 
implicates Wee1 in maintenance of genomic integrity during S  phase.  
• AZD1775 (formerly know n as MK -1775) is a selective inhibitor of Wee1 kinase.  Recent 
preclinical model data addit ionally show single agent anti -tumor activity in multiple cancer 
cell lines and tumor xenografts.  
• Preliminary data show AZD1775 is tolerable at lower doses in combin ation with 
chemotherapeutic agents.   We propose to demonstrate single -agent activity for AZD1775.  
 Primary Objective:  
• To establish the safety and tolerability of single-agent AZD1775 in patients with refractory solid tumors  
• To determine the pharmacokineti cs of AZD1775 in patients with refractory solid tumors  
 Secondary Objectives:  
• To evaluate t he antitumor activity of AZD1775 in patients with refractory solid tumors  
 Exploratory Objectives:  
• To determine the effect of AZD1775 on markers of DNA damage and ap optosis in tumor 
tissue and circulating tumor cells  
• To assess whether sufficient Wee1 inhib ition is maintained throughout the therapeuti c regimen  
• To identify tumor genomic alterations  and gene expression pattern s potentially associated with 
AZD1775 antitum or activity  
 Eligibility : 
• Patients must have histologically confirmed solid tumors for whic h all standard therapy 
known to prolong survival have failed , or for which standard therapies do not exist. 
• No major surgery, radiatio n, or chemotherapy within 3 wee ks (or 5 half- lives, whichever is 
shorter) prior to entering the study  
• Adequate organ function 
 
Study Design: 
• This study will follow a traditional 3+3 design . 
• In Arm  A starting at  dose level 1, AZD1775 will be administered orally , BID,  for 5 doses (D1 -
3) during each cycle.   Starting at dose level 2 and onwards, AZD1775 will be administered 
orally, BID,  for 5 doses for the first 2 weeks of each cycle (D1-3 and 8-10).  Each cycle is 21 
days (± 1 day for scheduling). 
• Once MTD is established, 6 additional patie nts will be enrolled at the MTD to further evaluate 
that dose for PK and PD endpoints. 
• A further expansion arm of 6 additional patients with documented tumors harboring BRCA-1 
or -2 mutations will also be enrolled at the MTD to further explore the safety o f the agent and 
obtain preliminary evidence of activity in this patient population.  
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
   4 • Based o n preliminary evidence of drug activity in an alternative once-daily dosing schedule, 
patients without a documented BRCA mutation will be accrued to a once-daily dosing 
schedule Arm  B, with mandatory paired tumor biopsies at the maximum tolerated single da ily 
dose, to further evaluate PD endpoints.  AZD1775 will be administered orally once daily for 5 days (D1- 5 and 8-12) during weeks 1 and 2 of each 21- day cycle (± 1 day for scheduling). 
• During the escalation phase, tumor biopsies will be optional and will be evaluated for 
pharmacodynamic (PD) studies fo r evidence of Wee1 inhibition, DNA damage and repair, and 
apoptosis ( γH2AX, pNbs1, Ra d51, pTyr15-Cdk, and caspase 3).   During the expansion phase, 
once MTD is reached, mandatory paired tumor biopsies will be pursued in up to 20 additional patients enrolled at the MTD to further evaluate PD endpoints.

a   During the escalation phase, optional paired tumor biopsies will be performed at baseline (pre -
treatment) and 2 -5 hours after the 5th dose of AZD1775 on C1D3.  In instances where there is a 
scheduling conflict, biopsies may be perform ed within + 1 day of the 5th dose of C1D3 .  
During the expansion phase, paired tumor biopsies will be mandatory in the six additional 
patients enrolled at the MTD.   Tumor biopsies will be optional in the 6 -patient BRCA mutation 
MTD expansion arm .   
 b  Blood samples for PK analyses will be collected at the following timepoints:  
C1D1: Pr ior to the initial first dose , and at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after the first dose 
C1D2: Prior to the 3rd dose administered on day 2 C1D3: Prior to the 5th dose, and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after the 5th dose administered on day 3 Additional PK sampling will be optional (but encouraged).  This s ampling would occur 24 and 
48 hours after the 5th dose of AZD1775, and will occur on Days 4 and 5, respectivel y (not 
reflected in Flow  Chart). 
 
c  Circulating tumor cells  will be obtained at baseline, and 2- 5 hours after the 5th dose of 
AZD1775 during cycl e 1 and cycle 2

2 BACKGROUND  
2.1 Cell Cycle Regulation  
Cell cycle regulation depends on a delicate balance between cyclins, cyclin-dependent 
 kinases ( Cdks) that allow  for progression through the cell cycle, and Cdk inhibitors that 
halt progression in the setting of DNA damage.  DNA replication during S phase generates intermediate DNA structures that are vulnerable to genotoxic insults.  In addition, on cogenes can induce lesions at replication forks, further exacerbating genomic 
instability.  In response to DNA damage, surveillance protei n complexes such as 
Mre11/Rad50-Nbs1 complex and Rad9/Rad1/Hus1 complex recruit repair proteins and halts cell cycle p rogression, allowing time for DNA repair.  Ataxia -telangectasia mutated 
(ATM) protein kinase and ataxia- telangectasia -related (ATR) protein kinase, two 
 members of the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase- like kinase (PIKK) family, are central to 
the DNA damage repair process.  Depending on the type of genotoxic stress, either ATM 
 or ATR is preferentially activated
1.  ATM is primarily activ ated in response to double-
 stranded DNA breaks, while ATR is activated by a broader spectrum of genotoxic stimuli and primarily activ ated in response to single -strand DNA breaks.  
 ATM/ATR kinases regulates cell cycle checkpoints by phosphorylation of mul tiple 
downstream proteins, including proteins associated with the recognition of double-stranded DNA breaks such histo ne H2AX, proteins involved in the assembly of protein 
complexes at the site of DNA damage, and effector kinases such as checkpoint kinase 1/2 
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 12 (Chk1) and (Chk2).  In contrast to Chk2, Chk1 can be activated by both ATM and ATR, 
and activation can occur during normal cell cycle progression or in response to replicative stress
2.  Activated Chk1 in turn concomitantly phosphorylates Wee1 and Cdc25C, 
thereby activating Wee1 kinase activity and inactivating Cdc25C phosphatase activity.  Wee1 is a tyrosine kinase impl icated in the in hibitory phosphorylation of CDK1/CDC2-
bound cyclin B c omplex responsible for G2 arrest
3.  Originally identified in fission 
yeast4, wee 1 deficiency resulted in pr emature mitotic entry and replication of smaller-
sized yeast.  Wee1 belongs to a family of protein kinases involved in the terminal phosphorylation and inactivation of (CDK1/CDC2) -bound cyclin B via phosphorylation 
of its Tyr15 residue near  the ATP -binding pocket (pTyr15- Cdk) , resulting in G2 cell 
cycle arrest in response to DNA damage.  Wee1 overexpression has been demonstrated in hepatocellular carcinoma
5, luminal and HER- 2 positive breast cancers6, colon, lung 
carcinoma, and seminoma tumor samples7. 
2.2 AZD1775  
Mechanism of Action  
AZD1775, is a selective, adenosine -triphosphate (ATP) com petitive, small molecule  
inhibitor of Wee1 kinase (IC 50 = 5.18nM), that  directly inhibits  phosphorylation of CDC2 
at Tyr15.  A comprehensive review of AZD1775 can be found in the AZD 1775 
Investigator's Brochure (2017).  
 AZD1775 has been sho wn to inhibit phosphorylated CDC2 in p53 mutant WiDr colon 
and l ung carcinoma cells, as measured by colorimetric ELISA in a dose-dependent 
manner [Figure 1A ].  Reduction of pY15- Cdk levels was recently demonstrated in the 
A673 Ewing sarcoma xenograft model  (included as  Figure 7).  Additionally, premature 
mitotic entry was demonstrated by concomitant increase in the percentage of cells expressing phosphorylated histone H3 at the same doses [Fig ure 1 B].  AZD1775 has 
demonstrated activity in multiple cancers based on in vitr o activity in  NCI 60 cell lines 
[Appendix B ].

2.4 Correl
ative Studies Background 
During the escalation phase, tumor biopsies will be optional and will be evaluated in 
pharmacodynamic (PD) studies for evidence of Wee1 inhibition, DNA damage and repair, 
and apoptosis (γ H2AX, pNbs1, Rad51, pTyr15-Cdk, and caspase 3).  During the expansion 
phase, once MTD is reached, mandatory paired tumor biopsies will be pursued in the 6 
additional patients enrolled at the MTD to further evaluate PD endpoints and to assess epithelial- mesenchymal  transition and immuno pharmacodynamics.  In Arm  B, with a once-
daily dosing schedule, tumor biopsies will also be optional during the escalation phase and mandatory during the expansion phase.  Paired tumor biopsies will be pursued in up to 20 
additional patients enro lled at th e maximum tolerated daily dose  to further evaluate PD 
endpoints.  Data generated from the tumor biopsies will be essential in establishing drug 
effect and will be used to inform future sequencing of com bination therapies.  
Fresh tissue biopsies will be evaluated for pTyr15-Cdk and γ H2AX.  Further evaluation of 
markers of D NA damage response will be performed based  on tissue availability : 
2.4.1 Assessing DNA damage response  
Dr. R. Kinders' laboratory, DCTD, has developed a DNA damage response immunofluorescence multiplex assay which includes Rad51, pNbs1, and γ H2AX 
measurements as markers of DNA damage- repair.  We additionally plan to measure 
cleaved caspase 3 as a marker of apoptosis.   pTyr15-Cdk expression by 
immunofluorescence will be evaluated for evidence of target effect.  
Histone H2AX is one of the H2A histones present in nucleosomes from normal tissues as 
well as cancer tissues.  H2AX is phosphorylated at its C -terminus (serine 139) within 
minutes followin g DNA double-strand breaks.  Phosphorylated H2AX, referred to as 
γH2AX, can be selectively detected using antibodies by Western blots or 
immunofluorescence.  The levels of γH2AX are directly correlated to the amounts of 
double-strand breaks per cell, and can be used as a dosimeter and biomarker for DNA 
double- strand bre aks. 
Nbs1 is an adapter protein, linking Mre11 and Rad50 to form the MRN complex involved in recognition of DNA damage and initiation of the signaling cascade in response to DNA double-strand breaks. 
Rad51 is a DNA repair protein involved in homologous recombination, where  it 
facilitates recognition of homologous DNA sequences and catalyzes strand exchange. 
Although the effect of AZD1775 as a single agent on the observable amount of DNA 
repair is not expected to be great, the collected data will be extremely important in evaluating future trials of AZD1775 plus DNA damaging agents.  Additionally, γ H2AX 
at longer periods post- dose (>12 hrs) is also a reporter of apoptosis.  

CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 20 Caspase-3 is a key protease activated during ea rly stages of apoptosis via cleavage of its 
pro-enzyme form into a heterodimer of 17- and 12-kDa subunits.  Immunofluorescence 
assays have been developed and validated by Dr. Kinders' laboratory, and will be 
performed on biopsy samples as a measure of apoptosis. 
CTCs will be collected at baselin e and then throughout the study to evaluate whether we 
can measure changes in the number and phenotype of CTCs in patients over time to 
explore any correlation with response to treatment or disease progression.  This analysis will be performed in Dr.  Kinde rs’ lab with the ApoStream instrument, which uses 
antibody-independent CTC isolation technology that can isolate viable CTCs from epithelial and non- epithelial cancers.  The enriched cells are then stained with a panel of 
antibodies targeting MUC1 (tumor m arker) and CEA (tumor marker), CK (epithelial 
marker), EpCAM (epithelial marker) and β -cat (CTNNB1; epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition m arker) and CD45 (PTPRC; leukocyte marker), as an exclusion marker.   
 
2.4.2 Evaluation of WEE-1 Inhibition with Cancer Immunotherapy 
A recent in vitro study demonstrated that WEE -1 inhibition enhances immune medi ated 
lysis of human cancer cells
19.  This was identified when examining the molecular 
mechanism by which brachyury, a T- box transcription factor that drives the epithelial -
mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human carcinoma, imparts resistance to tumor cells.  Tumor cells with high levels of brachyury displayed reduced susceptibility to lysis by immune cells, due to inefficient caspase- dependent apoptosis, manifested as inefficient 
nuclear lamin degradation in the presence of activated effector caspases.  This phenomenon correlated with a loss of cell cycle kinase CDK1, which mediates lamin phosphorylation, and pre- treatment of tumor cells with a negative regulator kinase of 
CDK1, using the WEE-1 inhibitor AZD1775 ( MK-1775), countered the defective 
apoptosis and sensitized resistant tumor cells to immune mediated lysis.   
 Based on the finding that WEE-1 inhibition enhances immune mediated lysis, we are collaborating with CCR’s Laboratory of Tumor Immunology to evaluate the combination of WEE-1 inhibition with cancer immunotherapy, specifically, the effect of AZD1775 on 
immune peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).  Peripheral immune cells will be evaluated pre- and post- treatment (baseline and day 8 ) in both Arm  A and Arm  B using 
27 markers in 4 panels to assess 123 immune subsets (Table 1).  These panels identify 9 standard immune cell subsets and 114 markers related to the maturation/function of these cells.  The results of this study will determine whether WEE -1 inhibition is immune 
inert, immune suppressive, or immune stimulatory, and wi ll provide critical information 
regarding the potential timing and scheduling of combining the AZD1775 with cancer immunotherapy (e.g., therapeutic vaccines or checkpoint inhibitors).   Serum will also be 
collected for analysis of cytokines and chemokines a s well as immune  activation markers 
such as CD40L  and CD27, and tumor- associated antigens.

2.4.3 Tumor Immuno score  
The host immune system has been shown to play a role in impeding cancer progression20.  
Therefore, as a pilot correlative study, we will correlate the response to treatment of each 
patient with colorectal cancer and adenocarcinoma with immunological biomarker expression in tumor biopsy samples by determining the Immunoscore
21.  It is hoped that 
this information will supplement traditional tumor staging (AJCC -UICC- TNM) which 
serves to p redict patient prognosis by evaluating histopathological characteristics of tumor 
biopsy samples22.   
 Immune cells can infiltrate tumors; their number, type, and loca tion (i.e., immune context) 
has been associated with disease -free survival and overall survival in large  human cancer 
studies
23-25.  An  Immunoscore is  determined from th e enumeration of a set of these 
immune cells, for example, cytotoxic (CD3+ and CD8+) and memory (CD 45RO+) T-cells 
in the core of the tumor (CT) and the invasive margin (IM).   
 Sections from FFPE- tumor tissue blocks will be evaluated for high immune cell infiltration 
and whether or not they include the CT and IM.  Enumeration of lymphocyte populations will be performed by Definiens by immunohistochemistry; clinical validation of the 
methods is currently being completed.     
2.4.4 Epithelial -mesenchymal transition  (EMT)  
EMT is a dynamic process that leads to increases in the migratory and invasive properties of tumor cells (1).  Histologically, these changes involve the loss of e pithelial marker E -
cadherin (E) and gain of the mesenchymal marker intermediate filament vimentin (V); loss of E-cadherin is linked to poor prognosis, tumor progression, and metastasis
26,27.  
 Recent data from DCTD confirm the existence of “transitional” cells that co -express both 
E-cadherin an d vimentin at the cellular level in FFPE clinical biopsies.  Quantitative 
analysis of various histologies  using an immunofluorescence assay developed and 
validated by DCTD revealed all possible phenotypes from very epithelial (E+V - colorectal

subpopulations, and EMT.

The potential clinical utility of this assay has been demonstrated : treatment with the 
multikinase inhibitor pazopanib resulted in a significant shift towards the mesenchymal phenotype in drug-sensitive but not insensitive human xenograft models (manuscript in preparation).  The EMT immunoassay will be used as to elucidate “baseline” EMT status in study patients—differences observed to date suggest inter- patient  phenotypic variation 
to be as significant a factor as histological differences within carcinomas —as well as to 
characterize drug response.  
 
2.4.5 Potential predictive molecular biomarkers of AZD1775 antitumor activity  
Tumors containing molecular alterations tha t enhance replicative stress may be particularly 
susceptible to Wee1 inhibition by AZD1775, with the heightened cell cycle stress in the presence of both factors representing a synthetic lethal interaction.  Several genomic alterations that induce replicative stress have been shown to potentially enhance AZD1775 antitumor activity in preclinical and/or clinical studies; these alterations include loss of function mutations in BRCA1/2
16,28,29 and SETD230 and amplification of CCNE1  or MYC29.  
For active Expansion Arm  B patients enrolled at the time of Amendment P (11/2/17) 
approval or thereafter, tumor biopsy cores remaining after completion of PD biomarker analyses will be used for whole-exome and RNA sequencing to identify these and other mutations or gene expression pattern s in patient tumor tissue and to examine potential 
associations between such molecular alterations and AZD1775 antitumor activity.  
 
 
 
2.5 Gene tic Sequencing Research Ethics 
This trial will collect genetic data from active Expansion Arm  B patients, enroll ed at the time 
of Amendment P (11/2/17) approval or thereafter, for exploratory studies to examine 
potential associations between genomic and RNA expression alterations and AZD1775 antitumor activity.  Tissue specimens used for sequencing analyses will be de- identified, with 
only limited clinical annotation (e.g., response to AZD1775) maintained for each specimen.  Designing the study poses challenging questions about informed consent, the privacy of the patient and the patient’s family, the researchers’ obligation to disclose genetic information to the patient, and the use and storage of research data
31-33.  In the vast majority of cases, we do 
not know the medical significance of genetic variants34,35.  These challenges will continue to 
be evaluated to maintain the rigor and integrity of the study and the wellbeing of our patients.  A Certificate of Confidentiality has been obtained from the NIH to help protect the privacy of all study participants.    
 The protocol includes a separate informed consent form for active Expansion Arm  B patients 
enrolled at the time of Amendment P (11/2/17) approval or thereafter; this consent form contains language pertaining to genetic sequencing studies.  Active Expansion Arm  B 
patients already enrolled at the time of Amendment P approval will be re -consented to the 
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 23 new, “genetic analysis” consent form prior to use of their specimens for exploratory 
sequencing analyses. 
 Whole- exom e sequencing (performed for research purposes but non- CLIA ) of tumor and 
blood can detect non-ambiguous germline variants, which may raise health and privacy implications for the patient and his or her family.  WES will not be validated for clinical use, and no clinical decisions can be made based on its results.  Furthermore, no genetic data will 
be shared with the patient.  This study does not meet the criteria specified by the NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy  (see Section 12.4
), and therefore, a GDS plan has not been included in this protocol. 
 
3 PATIENT SELECTION 
3.1 Eligibility Criteria  
3.1.1 Patients must have histologically confirmed solid tumors for which a ll standard 
therapy known to prolo ng survival have failed or for whic h standard therapies do 
not exist. 
3.1.2 Patients must have measurable disease or evaluable disease for the escalation 
phase; for the 6 additional patients enrolled at MTD for further evaluation of PK and PD endpoints (Expansion Arm  A).  For the 6- patient BRCA-mutation 
expansion arm , patients must have measurable disease; however, tumor biopsies 
are optional.  For Expansion Arm  B, patients must have  tumor  amenable to biopsy 
(excisional or incision biopsies of skin or H & N lesions under visualization ) and 
willing ness to undergo a tumor biopsy or patient will be undergoing a procedure 
due to medical necessity during which the tissue may be collected, or  tumor 
biopsy tissue from a previous research study or medical care is available for submission at registration.   Criteria for the submission of tissue are:  
  •   Tissue must have been collected within 3 months prior to registration  
  •   Patient has not received any intervening therapy for their cancer since the        collection of the tumor sample  
  •   Tumor tissu e must meet the minimum requirements outlined in Sectio n 9.    
3.1.3 Patients must have completed any chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, or biologic therapy ≥  3 weeks (or ≥ 5 half -lives, whichever is shorter) prior to 
entering the study.  Patients must be ≥ 2 weeks since any prior administration of a 
study drug in an exploratory IND/Phase 0 study or ≥  1 week  from palliative 
radiation therapy .  Patients must have recovered to eligibility levels from prior 
toxicity or advers e events.  
3.1.4 Age >18 years of age. 
3.1.5 ECOG performance status <1 (Karnofsky >60%, see Appendix A ). 
3.1.6 Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.  
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 24 3.1.7 Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: 
 
− leukocyt es      >3,000/mcL  
− absolute neutrophil count  >1,500/mcL  
− platelets        >100,000/mcL  
− hemoglobin      >9 g/dL 
− total bilirubin      <1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

− creatinine       <1.5X institutional upper limit of normal  
 OR  
− creatinine clearance     >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine 
levels above institutional normal. 
3.1.8 The effects of AZD1775 on the developing human fetus are unknown.  For this 
reason and because molecul ar inhibitors of Wee1 kinase  are known to be 
teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential (WoCBP) may be included only if 
acceptable contraception is in place for two weeks before study entry, for the duration of the treatment with the study drug, and for 2 month s after the last dose 
of AZD1775.  Male patients who are involved in the study must agree to avoid procreative and unprotected sex (i.e. , by using acceptable forms of contraception) 
and must not donate sperm during the study and for 3 months after the last dose of AZD1775.  Where the female partner is pregnant or not using effective birth 
control, men should be advised to abstain while in the study and for 3 months 
after the last dose of AZD1775.  Female partners, who are of child -bearing 
potential, of men participating in clinical studies of AZD1775 will also be required to use effective contraceptive measures while their partner is on study drug and for 3 months thereafter.  Male patients will be advised to arrange for the freezing of sperm samples  prior to the start of the study should they wish to father 
children while on AZD1775 or during the 3 months after stopping AZD1775. 
3.1.9 Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother w ith the study drugs, breastfeeding 
should be discontinued prior to the first of study drug and women should refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for 14 days following the last dose of study drug. 
3.1.10 Patients must be able to swallow whole tablets or capsules.   Nasogastric or G -tube 
administration is not allowed.  Any gastrointestinal disease which would impair ability to swallow, retain, or absorb drug is not allowed. 
3.1.11 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed conse nt 
document. 
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 26 required from each participant to confirm diagnosis .  For the BRCA- mutation 
expansion arm , confirmation of BRCA-1 or -2 mutations will be required prior to 
enrollment; pathology reports from  outsi de institutions will be accepted .

within 8 days  prior to enrollment.  
3.4.3 Imaging Studies (Eligibility  screening ): Every participant should have an 
evaluation of known sites of disease as part of the eligibility screening .  All 
patients will be  required to undergo a CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis to 
evaluate sites of  disease within 28 days prior to enrollment.  MRI evaluation of 
site of disease may be performed in lieu of CT evaluation at the discretion of the principal investigator if it is the opinion of the investigator that this modality would provide a more accurate assessment of disease than a CT  would, for a 
given site. 
3.4.4 Laboratory Evaluation: Eligibility screening  laboratory data are to be obtained 
within 8 days  prior to enrollment:  
• Hematological Profile: CBC with differential.  
• Biochemical Profile: albumin, total bilirubin, BUN,  calcium, creatinine, 
phosphorus, SGOT[AST], SGPT[ALT] , alkaline phosphatase, chloride, 
magnesium, potassium, and sodium. 
• Coagulation Profile: PT, PTT, INR  as clinically indicated prior to tumor 
biopsy. 
• Serum or urine pregnancy test for female participants of childbearing  
potential.  
3.4.5 Cardiac Evaluation: Baseline electrocardiogram will be obtained within 8 days  
prior to enrollment.  Additionally, patients must have electro cardiogram 
evaluation as clinically indicated .

5 TREATMENT PLAN  
This is an open -label Phase I trial evaluating safety and tolerability of single -agent AZD1775 
(MK -1775), an oral inhibitor of Wee1, in patients with refractory advanced solid tumors.  
Reported adverse e vents and potential risks for AZD1775 are described in Section 7.  
Appropriate dose modifications for AZD1775 are described in Section 6.  
 
Patient evaluations will be performed throughout the study as described below.  Baseline history, physical examination, laboratory evaluations, and EC G must be conducted within 8 
days prior to start of protocol therapy.  If protocol therapy is started within 8 days of the eligibility screening evaluations (see Section 3.4 ), the results from these screening 
evaluations may be used as baseline measurements.  If >8 days have passed since the screening evaluations, the medical history, physical examination, laboratory evaluations, and ECG must be repeated prior to starting protocol therapy.  Baseline tumor imaging must be 
performed within 28 days prior to start of protocol therapy.  If protocol therapy is started within 28 days of the eligibility screening tumor imaging, the screening evaluation imaging 
results may be used as baseline measurements; if >28 days have passed since the screening 
evaluation tumor imaging, the imaging must be repeated prior to starting protocol therapy.  
For dose level 1  of the original dosing schema ( Arm A), AZD1775 wil l be administered 
orally for 5 doses each cycle, with doses administered approximately 12 hours apart starting with the first dose for that week (for example, if the patient take s the first dose at 9  am on 
Monday then the next dose will be administered  at 9 pm that evening) .  Starting at dose level 
2 and onwards in this arm , AZD1775 will be administered orally for 5 doses for the first 2 
weeks of each cycle, with doses administered approximately 12 hours apart starting with the first dose for that week (as explained above except it will occur over t he first two weeks of 
the cycle).  Each cycle is 21 days (± 1 day for scheduling).  Patients will be asked to maintain 
a Study Medication Diary ( Appendix D ) and record each dose of medication.  Patients will 
be given instructions for completing the medication diary and will be asked to return it to the clinic  staff at the end of each cycle.  
 
Once the MTD is established, 6 additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD to fur ther 
evaluate that dose for PK and PD endpoints (Expansion Arm  A).  An additional expansion 
arm of 6 patients with documented tumors harboring BRCA-1 or - 2 mutations will also be 
enrolled at the MTD to further explore the safety of AZD1775 and obtain preli minary 
evidence of activity in this patient population .  This information may inform patient selection 
for further development of this agent.  Patients in this  BRCA-mutant expansion arm  must 
have measurable disease; tumor biopsies will be optional. 
 
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 28 Based on preclinical data with once daily AZD1775 dosing, Arm B, starting at 200 mg once 
daily for 5 doses each week, for two consecutive weeks will be established to evaluate PD 
and PK endpoints.  Patients will be accrued in arm s of 3, based on a 3+3 design, fo r up to 
two dose levels.  The cycle length will remain at 21 days (+ 1 day for scheduling).    Once the maximum tolerated single daily dosing is established, up to 20  additional patients will be 
enrolled on Expansion Arm  B with mandatory biopsies to furthe r evaluate PD endpoints.   
 History and physical examination will be done at baseline (within 8 days prior to the start of protocol therapy) and before the start of each  new cycle thereafter (up to 3 days before the 
start of a new cycle) .  Patients will be  examined on D1  and D8 at the clinical center during 
the first cycle and prior to every new cycle.   As of Amendment G (dated 07/17/2014), the MTD  for Arm  A was established at 225 mg 
twice daily for 5 doses each week, for two consecutive weeks.  As of Amen dment M 
(dated 11/20/16), the Arm  B MTD was established at 300 mg once daily on days 1-5 
each week, for two consecutive weeks.  
 Labs (CBC with differential; seru m chemistries ) will be performed at baseline (within 8 days 
prior to the start of protocol therapy) , D8, and D15 of cycle 1  (±1 day due to scheduling 
conflicts), then at the start of each cycle (up to 3 days before start of a new cycle).  
 CT scans will be performed at baseline ( within 8 days prior to the start of protocol therapy ), 
and repeat imaging scans will be performed every  2 cycles (3 or 4 cycles for patients on 
study for more than one or three year s, respectively ).  MRI evaluation of site of disease may 
be performed in lieu of CT evaluation at the discretion of the principal investigator if it is the opinion of the investigator that this modality would provide a more accurate assessment of disease than a CT would for a given site.  
5.1 Agent Administration  
After cycle 2, a cycle will be considered completed if 90% of the prescribed AZD1775  
doses ar e administered.  
5.1.1 Dose Escalation Phase ( Arm A) 
The primary objective of the t rial is to establish the safety , tolerability , and 
maximum tolerated dose  of single- agent AZD1775.   
 For dose level 1, AZD1775 will be administered orally for 5 doses each cycle, 
with doses administered approximately 12 hours apart starting with the first dose for that week (for example, if the patient takes the first dose at 9AM on Monday then the next dose will be administered at 9 pm that evening).  Starting at dose level 2 and onwards, AZD1775 will be administered orally for 5 doses for the first 2 weeks of each cycle, with doses administered approximately 12 hours apart starting with the first dose for that week (as explained above except it will occur over the first two weeks of the cycle) .  The duration of a cycle will be 21 days 
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 29 (± 1 day for scheduling).  Dose escalation will proceed in arm s of 3 patient s each 
(3+3 design) as outlined below (Table 1):  
 
Table 1. Arm  A Dose Escalation Scheme  
 
Dose Escalation Schedule  for Arm  A 
Dose 
Level  AZD1775 (orally BID) x 5 doses/weeks 
-1 200 mg BID x 5 doses (days 1 -3) for 1 week 
1 225 mg BID x 5 doses (days 1 -3) for 1  week  
2 225 mg BID x 5 doses (days 1 -3 each week) for 2 weeks  
3 300 mg BID x 5 doses (days 1-3 each week) for 2 weeks  
4 400 mg BID x 5 doses (days 1-3 each week) for 2 weeks  
5 550 mg BID x 5 doses (days 1-3 each week) for 2 weeks  
 Optional paired tumor biopsies will be obtained in patients who have disease amenable to biopsy during the escalation phase; mandatory paired tumor biopsies will be pursued in patients during the expansion phase in the 6 additional patients 
enrolled at the MTD  (Expansion Arm  A).  For the 6- patient BRCA- mutant 
expansion arm  at the MTD, disease must be measurable; however, tumor biopsies 
will be optional.    The trial will follow a standard 3+3 dose escalation study wherein 3 patients should have completed at least one cycle of therapy prior to considering dose escalation in the next arm of patients.  Dose escalation will proceed until dose-
limit ing toxicity is observed.  DLT is defined in Section 5.2.  Determination of 
DLT will be based on toxicities observed in the first cycle of therapy.  Patients are considered evaluable for toxicity for the purpose of arm  dose escalation decisions 
if they either 1) experienced  DLT or 2) have received 90% of treatment doses for 
cycle one of therapy and have been followed for one full cycle without DLT.  All toxicities  will be reported for all patients who receive any amount of study drug 
on this study.  Evaluation of toxicity will begin with study drug administration on cycle 1 day 1.  Intra -patient dose escalation will be permitted if: a) there is no toxicity > Grade 1 
that is related (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the study drug at the initial 
dose level experienced by that patient, b) higher doses have been evaluated and completed without DLT, and c) the patient’s disease has not progressed .  Doses 
may be escalated, provided conditions a–c are met, up to the last evaluated dose level NOT associated with DLT.

 30 5.1.2 Dose Escalation Phase ( Arm B) 
For Arm  B, AZD1775 will be administered once daily for 5 doses each week, for 
two consecutive weeks.  The duration of a cycle will be 21 days (+1 day for 
scheduling).  Dose escalation will proceed i n arm s of 3 patients each (3+3 design) 
as outlined in Table 2:  Table 2. Arm  B Escalation Scheme  
Dose Escalation Schedule for Arm B 
Dose Level  AZD1775 (orally once daily)  
-1 200 mg daily D1- 3 each week for 2 weeks 
1 200 mg daily x D1 -5 each week for 2 weeks 
2 225 mg daily x D1 -5 each week for 2 weeks  
3 250 mg daily D1- 5 each week for 2 weeks 
4 300 mg daily D1- 5 each week for 2 weeks 
5 400 mg daily D1- 5 each week for 2 weeks 
6 500 mg daily D1- 5 each week for 2 weeks 
 
5.2 Definition of Dose -Limiting Tox icity 
Determination of dose- limiting toxicity will be based on toxicities observed in the first 
cycle of therapy.  Dose escalation will proceed within each arm  according to the 
following scheme.  Dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined below.   
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 31 Number of P atients with DLT at a 
Given Dose Level  Escalation Decision Rule  
0 out of 3  Enter 3 patients at the next dose level.  
>2 Dose escalation will be stopped.  This dose level will be 
declared the maximally administered dose (highest dose administered).  Three (3) additional patients will be entered at the next lowest dose level if only 3 patients were treated previously at that dose.  
1 out of 3  Enter at least 3 more patients at this dose level.  
• If 0 of these 3 patients experience DLT, proceed to the next dose level.  
• If 1 or more of this group suffer DLT, then dose escalation is stopped, and this dose is declared the maximally administered dose.  Three (3) additional patients will be entered at the next lowest dose level if only 3 patients were treated previously at that dose.  
<1 out of 6 at highest dose level below 
the maximally administered dose  This is generally the recommended phase 2 dose.  At least 6 
patients must be entered at the recommended phase 2 dose. 
 
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as an a dverse event that is related (possibly, 
probably, or definitely) to administration of AZD1775 and fulfills one of the following 
criteria:  
5.2.1 Grade ≥ 3 Non- Hematological Toxicity  
  Grade ≥ 3 non- hematological toxicity felt to be related to study    
  medications will be  considered dose- limiting with the following    
  clarifications:  
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 33 and fosaprepitant are not permitted due to known drug interactions with 
AZD1775.  In addition, if a patient develops nausea and/or vomiting that is Grade 
2 or greater, antiemetics  may be instituted prophylactically at the discretion of the 
investigator.  Nausea and vomiting will be considered refractory if it does not resolve to≤ Grade 1 with  treatment with a combination of at least 2 of the 
antiemetics within 24 hours.   Patients should be strongly encouraged to maintain 
liberal oral fluid intake.  
5.3.2 Diarrhea  
If diarrhea develops and does not have an identifiable cause other than st udy drug 
administration, anti- diarrheals such as Lomotil (diphenoxylate HCl 2.5 mg + 
atropine  sulfate 0.025 mg/tablet) dosed according to package insert or loperamide 
4 mg po after the first unformed stool with 2 mg po with every 2 hours as long as unforme d stools continue (4 mg every 4 hours while asleep).  No more than 16 
mg of loperamide  should be taken during a 24-hour period.  This r egimen can be 
repeated for each diarrheal episode.   Diarrhea will be considered refractory if it 
does not resolve within 24 hours ≤  to G rade 2 with the above regimen (maximum 
of 16 mg of loperamide in a 24- hour period).  If the  patient develops blood or 
mucus in the stool, dehydration, or hemodynamic instability, or fever along with the diarrhea, anti -diarrheals will be disc ontinued and the patient will be treated 
with IV fluids and antibiotics as medically indicated.  
5.3.3 Neutropenia 
To reduce the risk of severe myelosuppression events, a complete blood count 
(CBC)  should be performed weekly during cycle 1, and at the start of ea ch 
subsequent cycle (up to 3 days before start of new cycle) in the dose escalation 
phase.  In the expansion phase, CBC will be performed on D1 and D8 of cycle 1, then at the start of each cycle (up to 3 days before start of new cycle).   Febrile 
neutropeni a is a life -threatening complication requiring hospitalization and urgent 
broad spectrum antibiotics, as well as an aggressive search for the source and microbial cause of the episode.   Growth factors to prevent neutropenia will not be 
administered prophyl actically.  If necessary, they may be administered according 
to accepted  American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines to allow 
re-treatment.  
5.3.4 Anemia  
Symptomatic anemia should be treated with red blood cell transfusion and is recommended if the he moglobin falls below 8 g/dL.  The initiation of 
erythropoietic  therapy for the management of chemotherapy -induced anemia 
follows the American  Society of Hematology/ASCO clinical practice guidelines 
(http://www.asco.org).  
5.3.5 Thrombocytopenia 
Thrombocytopenia w ill be treated conservatively.  In the absence of bleeding, or a 
necessary invasive procedure, platelet transfusions should be given for a platelet 
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 34 count ≤10,000/mm3.  If invasive procedure(s) is (are) planned, or the patient 
develops bleeding, platelet transfusions should be administered in accordance with 
the standard of practice, usually maintaining a platelet count above 50,000/mm3. 
5.4 Duration of Therapy  
 In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event s, treatment may continue until 
one of the following criteria applies:  
• Disease progression  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
• Significant toxicity occurs despite 2 dose reductions as described in Section 6  or no 
lower  dose level exists  
• Pregnancy 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or  
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient  
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
5.5 Duration of Follow Up 
Patients will be followed for 30 days after the last dose is administered or until one of the 
following occurs: patient enrolls on another protocol, patient receives standard of   care, or 
death, w hichever comes first.  The follow-up will consist of a phone call between Days 
27-30 after the  last dose to evaluate adverse events that were ongoing and any new events 
that might be deemed  related to the therapy.  Toxicities felt to be possibly, probably, or 
definitely related to the study  drugs that have not resolved or stabilized by Day 30 post-
treatment will be followed until stabilization or resolution via phone calls as clinically 
indicated .  An optional biopsy from patients who have progressed may be requested if the 
patient has not yet received any new treatment to assess whether progression correlates 
with a change in study pharmacodynamic marker; separate consent will be obtained.   
5.6 Criteria for Removal from Study  
Patients will be removed from stud y for one of the following reasons: completed 30-day 
follow  up period or toxicities are unresolved but stabilized, patient enrolls on another 
protocol, or patient receives standard of care.  The reason for study removal and the date the patient was removed  must be documented in the medical record and communicated to 
Central Registration per Section 4. 
  
6 DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
Toxicities should have resolved to < Grade 2 prior to starting the next cycle .  Treatment may 
be delayed for a maximum of 2 weeks beyond the actual cycle length of 21 days for toxicities that develop and do not resolve as defined above.  Beyond two weeks, the patient will not receive further therapy on this protocol and will be followed for resolution of to xicities .  
 
Treatments may be delayed up to 7 days past the end of the previous cycle of 21 days for scheduling conflicts at the discretion of the investigator.  
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 35  
Patients will be allowed up to 2 dose reductions.  If more than 2 dose reductions are require d, 
the patient will be removed from the study.  
6.1 Dose Reduction  
Dose modifications are defined below:  
6.1.1 Grade 2 Drug -related toxicity : No changes will be made to the dose of 
AZD1775 for Grade 2 toxicities.  Therapy will not be interrupted for Grade 2 hematologic toxicities.  
6.1.2 Grade 3 -4 Drug -related non-hematologic toxicities:  Doses of AZD1775 will be 
held until toxicities recover to  < Grade 2 or baseline prior to re -initiating 
treatment at the next lower dose level.  Electrolyte abnormalities will not require dose reduction if resolution to Grade 2 or less is documented within 72 hours.  Dose modifications for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea will be made only if they are refractory to treatment (See 
Section 5.3).   
6.1.3 Grade 3 Drug -related hematologi c toxicities: Dose of AZD1775 will be held 
until hematologic toxicities , except  anemia, lymphopenia, or leukopenia in the 
absence of neutropenia,  have resolved to < Grade 2 pr ior to re -initiating treatment 
at the same dose level.  
6.1.4 Grade 4 Drug -related Hemat ologic Toxicities:  Dose of AZD1775 will be held 
until hematologic toxicities , except  anemia, lymphopenia, or leukopenia in the 
absence of neutropenia,  have resolved to < Grade 2 prior to re -initiating treatment 
at the next lower dose level.

 A cycle is defined as 21 days, with D1 starting the first day of AZD1775 administration.  If a p atient receives 90%  of scheduled treatments of AZD1775 and remains in the study 
until D21, the patient will be considered to have completed a cycle of therapy.  Patients who do not complete a cycle of therapy for reasons other than toxicity will be replaced.  Patients who do not complete one cycle of therapy due to toxicity will not be replaced.  All patients should have completed one cycle of the rapy (unless removed from the study 
due to toxicity), at which point they will be evaluable. 
  
7 ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of A Es (Section 7.1 ) and the characteristics of an observed AE ( Section 7.2) 
will determine whether the event requires expedited  reporting (via CTEP- AERS ) in addition  
to routine reporting.

7.2 Adverse Event Characteristics  
• CTCAE term (AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales 
found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  
(CTCAE) version 4.0 wi ll be utilized for AE reporting  until March 31, 2018.  
CTCAE version 5.0 will be utilized for AE reporting beginning April 1, 2018.  All 
appropriate treatment  areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0.  
A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can  be downloaded from  the CTEP web site  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm.  
  
• ‘Expectedness’ : AEs can be ‘Unexpected’ or ‘Expected’ (see Section 7.1 above) for  
expedited reporting purposes only.  ‘E xpected’ AEs (the ASAEL) are bold and 
italicized in  the CAEPR ( Section 7.1 ). 
 
• Attribution of the AE:  
 1. Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment.  
 2. Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
 3. Po ssible – The AE may be related to the study treatment.  
 4. Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
 5. Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.  
 
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 40 7.3 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting  
 
7.3.1 Expedited AE reporting for this study must use CTEP- AERS  (CTEP Adverse 
Event Reporting System ), accessed via the CTEP Web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov).  The reporting procedures to be followed are presented in 
the “ NCI Guidelines for  Investigators:  Adverse Event Reporting Requirements for  
DCTD (CTEP and CIP) and DCP INDs and IDEs ” which can be downloaded 
from the CTEP Web site  (http://ctep.cancer.gov).   These requirements are briefly 
outlined in the tables below ( Section 7.3.3).  
7.3.2 In the rare occurrence when Inter net connectivity is lost, a 24- hour notification is 
to be made to CTEP by telephone at 301-897-7497.  Once Internet connectivity is restored, the  24-hour notification phoned in must be entered electronically into 
CTEP- AERS  by the original submitter at the site. 
7.3.3 Expedited Reporting Guidelines 
Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol-specific patient ID assigned during 
trial registration on all reports.  
 Note:  A death on study requires both routine and expedited reporting regardless of causality, unless as noted below.  Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided.  
 Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Disease 
Progression ” in the system organ class (SOC) “General disorders and 
administration site conditions .”  Eviden ce that the death was a manifestation of 
underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or 
progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be submitted.

FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investiga tors MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse Events, 
whether or not they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 
312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY of the followi ng outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization for ≥ 24 hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to  conduct normal life 
functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgment, they may

 42 7.3.5 Pregnancy, Fetal Death, and Death Neonatal  
NOTE: When submitting CTEP- AERS  reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy 
loss”,  or “Neonatal loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form should be completed 
for patients who became pregnant on study, and faxed along with any additional 
medical information to (301) 230-0159.  The potential risk of exposure of the 
fetus to the investigational agent(s) or chemo therapy agent(s) should be 
documented in the “Description of Event” section of the CTEP -AERS  report.  
 
7.3.5.1 Pregnancy 
• Because p atients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure 
of the fetus to agents which may be teratogenic DCTD/DCP is req uesting 
that pregnancy should be reported in an expedited manner via CTEP-
AERS  as Grade 3 “ Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - 
Other (pregnancy) ” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions  SOC.  
• The pregnancy outcome for patients on study should be reported via CTEP- AERS  at the time the outcome becomes known, accompanied by 
the same Pregnancy Report Form used for the initial report. 
 7.3.5.2 Pregnancy loss  
• Pregnancy loss is defined in CTCAE as “Death in utero.” 
• Any pregnancy loss should be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 “Pregnancy loss ” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions SOC. 
• A pregnancy loss should NOT be reported as a Grade 5 event under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC, as currently CTEP-AERS  recognizes this event as a patient death.  
 7.3.5.3 Death Neonatal  
• Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by cessation of life occurring during the first 28 days of life” that is felt by the investigator to be at least po ssibly due to the investigational 
agent/intervention, should be reported expeditiously. 
• A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4 “ Death 
neonatal ” under the General disorders and administration SOC.  
• Neonatal death should NOT be reported as Grade 5 “Death neonatal” under the General disorders and administration SOC.  If reported as such, the CTEP- AERS  interprets this as a death of the patient being treated.

 43 7.3.6 NIH IRB Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events, Unanticipated Problems, and 
Deaths  
7.3.6.1 Definitions  
Adverse event  
An adverse event is defined as any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that 
occurs  during the course of the clinical trial associated with the use of a drug in  
humans, whether or not the event is considered related to the t reatment or  
clinically significant.   For this study, AEs will include events reported by the 
patient, as well as clinically significant abnormal findings on physical examination or laboratory evaluation.  A new illness, symptom, sign or clinically  
signifi cant laboratory abnormality or worsening of a pre -existing condition or 
abnormality is considered an AE.  All AEs must be recorded on the AE case report form unless otherwise noted in Section 7.3.4.  All AEs, including clinically signi ficant abnormal findings on laboratory  
evaluations, regardless of severity, will be followed until satisfactory resolution.   
AEs should be reported up to 30 days following the last dose of study drug.  An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE if the laboratory abnormality is characterized by any of the following:  
• Results in discontinuation from the study  
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention  
• Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including hospitalization  
• Is judged by the Investigator to be of significant clinical impact  
• If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the 
investigator will provide details about the action taken with resp ect to the 
test drug and about the patient’s outcome.  
 
Suspected adverse reaction  
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused the adverse event.  For the purposes of 
IND safety reporti ng, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  A suspected adverse 
reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction,  
which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  Unexpected adverse reaction  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity  
that has been observed; or, if a n investigator brochure is not required or available,  
is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application.   “Unexpected” also refers to adverse 
events or suspected adverse reacti ons that are mentioned in the investigator 
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 44 brochure as occurring  with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the  
pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as 
occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
 Serious  
An Unanticipated Problem or Protocol Deviation is serious if it meets the definition of a Serious Adverse Event or if it compromises the safety, welfare or rights of subjects or others.  
 Serious  Adverse Event  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reacti on is considered serious if in the  
view of the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:  
• Death,  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or  require hospitalization may be considered a serious 
adverse drug experience  when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 Disability  
A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
 
Life-threatening adverse drug experience  
Any adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that places the patient or subject,  
in the view of the investigator or sponsor, at immediate risk of death from  the 
reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 Protocol Deviation (NIH Definition) Any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB  approved research protocol. 
 Non-compliance (NIH Definition)  
The failure to comply with applicable NIH Human Research Protections Program (HRPP) policies, IRB requirements, or regulatory requirements for the protection of human research subjects  
 Unanticipated Problem  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that:  
• Is unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to 
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 45  (a) the research risks that are described in the IRB -approved   
 research protocol  and informed consent document; Investigator’s   
 Brochure or other study doc uments, and 
 (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; A ND 
 
• Is related or possibly related to participation in the research; AND  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a g reater risk of 
harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than 
was previously known or recognized.   
 
7.3.6.2 NIH IRB and Clinical Director Reporting Requirements  
 
The Protocol PI will report in the NIH Problem Form to the NIH -IRB and 
NCI Clinical Director : 
• All deaths, except deaths due to progressive disease 
• All Protocol Deviations  
• All Unanticipated Problems  
• All non-compliance 
 Reports must be received within 7 days of PI awareness via iRIS.  
 
7.3.6.3 NIH IRB Reporting of IND Safety Reports  
Only IND Safety Reports that meet the definition  an unanticipated 
problem will need to be reported to the N IH IRB.  
7.4 Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
All Adverse Events must  be reported in routine study data submissions.  AEs reported 
through CTEP -AERS  must also be reported in routine study data submissions .  
7.4.1 NIH IRB Requirements for PI Reporting at Continuing Review  
Please use t he following table for reporting  adverse event at time of CR :

 46 • All Grade 3 and 4 events that are possibly, probably or definitely related to 
the rese arch;  
• All Grade 5 events regardless of attribution; 
• All Serious Events regardless of attribution.  
 
  NOTE: Grade 1 events are not required to be reported. 
7.5 Secondary Malignancy 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous malignancy  (e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy).  A 
secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.   CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP- AERS .  Three options are available to 
describe the event:  
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., a cute myelocytic 
leukemia [AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
7.6 Second Malignancy  
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy).   Second malignancies require ONLY 
routine reporting via CDUS  unless otherwise specified .  
  
8 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION

9 CORRELATIVE/ SPECIAL STUDIES  
We plan to evaluate the in vivo molecular effects of AZD1775 using pre- and post- treatment 
tumor biopsy specimens and CTCs; blood will additionally be collected for PK analysis.  
Samples will be collected during cycle 1 at baseline an d 2-5 hours after the 5th dose of 
AZD1775 or , as of Amendment M (11/20/16), prior to the 6th dose of AZD1775 on day 8 
during cycle 1 only.  In addition, an optional “restaging follow-up biopsy” may be performed 
on day 1 ( ± 2 days) of the cycle following any restaging at which a 10-20% increase in tumor 
volume is observed (according to RECIST criteria) if the patient has been on study for at 
least 4 cycles, or at time of disease progression.  Patients have the option to undergo paired tumor biopsies as part of participation in this study during the escalation phase; paired tumor biopsies will be required during the expansion phase at the MTD (Expansion Arm  A).  
Tumor biopsies will be optional in the expansion arm  of BRCA patients.  For Arm  B on a 
once-daily dosing schedule, mandatory paired tumor biopsies will be pursued in up to 20 patients enrolled at the maximum tolerated daily dose to further evaluate PD endpoints.

9.2.4 Tumor Biopsies  
9.2.4.1 Timing of tumor biopsies  
Biopsies will be optional during the escalation phase and mandatory in the 6 additional patients enrolled at the MTD  during the expansion phase (Expansion 
Arm A).  Tumor biopsies will remain optional in the expansion arm  of BRCA 
patients and follow the biopsy collection times as follows.  Biopsies will be collected : 
• before drug administration on study (baseline), and 
• on cycle 1, day 3; 2-5 hours after the 5th dose of AZD1775 
 
For the patients enrolled on Arm  B, biopsies will remain optional during the 
escalation phase, but will be mandatory in up to 20 patients enrolled at the maximum tolerated single daily  dosing schedule during the expansion phase.  
Biopsies will be collected:  
• before drug administration on study (baseline), and 
• on cycle 1, day 8; prior to  the 6th dose of AZD1775 (+/ - 1 day) 
• optionally, at disease progression or on day 1 ( ± 2 days) of the cycle following 
any restag ing at which a 10-20% increase in tumor volume is observed 
(according to RECIST criteria) if the patient has been on study for at least 4 cycles.  (For example, a biopsy would be performed on cycle 6 day 1 for a 10-20% tumor volume increase detected at the restaging following cycle 4). 
 
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 53 9.2.4.2 Biopsy Procedure 
Serial tumor biopsies will be obtained by the Interventional Radiology team by a percutaneous approach.  It is preferred that up to 5 core biopsies ≥ 18 gauge in 
diameter and ≥1 cm in length will be obtained during each procedure if 
considered safe and feasible.  It is estimated that there will be  between 2 million–
5 million cells from e ach biopsy.  If a site is deemed appropriate for biopsy with 
minimal risk to the participant by agreement between the  investi gators and 
Interventional Radiology team, an attempt for biopsy will be made.  
 The use of imaging to facilitate biopsies will be decided by members of the  
Interventional Radiology team and may include ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI.  Should a CT scan be needed for biopsy, the number of scans for each procedure will be limited to the minimum number needed to safely obtain a biopsy.  Tumor biopsies and local anesthesia will be administered only if they are considered to 
be of low risk to the participant, as determined by the investigators and Interventional Radiology.  Acceptable biopsy procedures are: percutaneous biopsy with local anesthetic; excisional cutaneous biopsy with local anesthetic; other biopsy with local anesthetic and/or sedation that has been show n to have a risk of severe 
complications < 2%; biopsy with removal of additional tumor tissue during a medically necessary mediastinoscopy, laparoscopy, gastrointestinal endoscopy, 
bronchoscopy, or craniotomy; removal of additional tumor tissue during a 
medically necessary surgical procedure.  No open surgical, laparoscopic 
endoscopic procedure will be performed solely to obtain a biopsy for this protocol.  If the participant chooses not to undergo tumor biopsy, he/she will still remain in the study and rec eive study medication, and all the other correlative studies will 
be performed.  
 
Tumor biopsies are  optional during the escalation phase and mandatory for the 
additional patients enrolled at the MTD during the BRCA- arm expansion phase.  
Baseline biopsies w ill be performed following patient enrolling  on study.  For 
Arm B, if the patient had a biopsy within the past 3 months and had no treatment 
since that biopsy, an attempt will be made to obtain and process that tissue as baseline biopsy.  If the tissue is not of sufficient quality or cannot be used for protocol-specified PD studies, a percutaneous biopsy will be performed.  If an 
initial attempt at percutaneous biopsy is unsuccessful, the patient will be given an option to proceed with a repeated attempt at percutaneous biopsy.  A separate consent form must be signed for each biopsy procedure, so patients may choose not to undergo subsequent biopsies.  If the baseline biopsy is unsuccessful or the patient refuses to undergo subsequent biopsies, no further bi opsies will be 
performed but the patient will remain on study, receive study  medication, and 
other correlative studies will be performed.

 54 9.2.4.3 Solid Tumor Biopsy Processing 
Up to 5 tissue cores will be collected.   Core s will be flash frozen  in liquid 
nitrogen  and submitted to Dr. Kinders' laboratory  for evaluation of DNA damage 
markers , and H&E pathology evaluation.  The frozen  biopsy specimens are 
transferred to PADIS, where the core biopsy sample s are stored at -80°C and 
subsequently processed within 7-10 da ys for analysis.   Biopsy samples will be 
analyzed for  γH2AX and pTyr15- Cdk.  Additional analyses of markers of DNA 
damage will depend on tissue availability.  One half -core pre- treatment flash 
frozen biopsy will be saved and stored for future analyses: targeted sequencing for DNA repair defects and p53 mutational analysis is being discussed with the 
laboratories.  Such studies, if performed, will be conducted following an amendment to the current protocol.  
 
Biopsies for PD analysis will be shipped on dry ice to:

9.2.5 Sample Collection and Processing 
Biospecimens will be collected and processed using validated SOPs that will 
ensure both specimen quality and patient confidentiality pursuant to informed consent provisions.  Information ab out each specimen (e.g., blood, tumor biopsy, 
circulating tumor cells, per specific protocol) will be recorded on a PK/PD  
collection worksheet included in Appendix F . 
 Using a computerized inventory system and a backup hardcopy process, all specimen  collection and processing steps will be documented and the specific 
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 55 location of each specimen will be tracked.  Each new specimen collected will be 
assigned a unique barcode identifier that can be linked to the original specimen collected and other relevant  information within the inventory system.  To ensure 
patient confidentiality, only containers used for the initial specimen collections will be labeled with patient identifiers.    
 Only the barcode identifier will be applied to all subsequent specimen containers.   
When  specimens are processed and aliquoted, no patient information will be 
included on the  new containers.  Original specimen containers will be discarded.   
Only barcode- labeled  specimens without patient identifiers will be shipped for 
analysis and/or storage.   Specimen labels will indicate: CTEP protocol number, 
unique patient accession number, 3- digit sample number (see list below), 
collection time, and total volume collected, as appropriate.   Samples from sets of 
at least three patients will be grouped for scientific  analysis.  
 Standardized 3- digit sample collection numbers: 
100 series: urine for PK  
200 series: blood for PK 300 series: blood for PD 400 series: blood for circulating tumor cells (CTCs)  
500 series: tumor biopsies 800 seri es: blood for pharmacogenomics or other research use  
 The inventory process contains other security provisions sufficient to safeguard patient  privacy and confidentiality.  Access to the inventory system and associated 
documents will be restricted to appro priate individuals.  Requests to use 
specimens stored in the repository must be approved.  The only patient information available in the inventory system will be the patient sex, diagnosis, and level of informed consent given.  SOPs  ensure that any changes in informed 
consent made by a patient and relayed to the PI will be reflected in the inventory system to ensure that specimens are destroyed as appropriate.  All laboratory personnel will be trained to adhere to SOPs and will be  monitored for high -quality 
performance. 
 
Any pharmacokinetic sample remaining after analysis for AZD1775 may  
be used for exploratory DDI, metabolite, or biomarker analyses.  For example, circulating citrulline concentration is emerging as a biomarker candidate for the assessment of  intestinal function and chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal 
toxicity, and preclinical studies of  AZD1775 found a reasonable correlation 
between villus atrophy and decreases in body weight and plasma citrulline. Thus, remaining plasma PK samples may be used to evaluate changes in plasma citrulline and its relationship to GI toxicities.  
 Any new use of these samples will require prospective IRB review and approval.  Access to these samples will only be granted following IRB approval of an additional protocol, granting the rights to use the material.

 56  
If at any time, a patient withdraws from the study and does not wish for their existing samples to be utilized, the individual must provide a written request.  Following receipt of this request, the samples wil l be destroyed (or returned to the 
patient, if so requested), and  reported as such to the IRB.  Any samples lost (in 
transit or by a researcher) or destroyed  due to unknown sample integrity (i.e., 
broken freezer allows for extensive sample thawing, etc.) w ill be reported as such 
to the IRB.  
  
9.2.5.1 Human Data Sharing Plan What data will be shared?  We will share human data generated in this research for future research as follows:  
x De -identified data in an NIH-funded or approved public repository  
x Identified data in BTRIS (automatic for activities in the Clinical Center)  
x De -identified or identified data with approved outside collaborators under 
appropriate agreements   How and where will the data be shared?  Data will be shared through:  x An NIH-funded or approved public repository: clinicaltrials.gov 
x BTRIS (automatic for activities in the Clinical Center)  
x Approved outside collaborators under appropriate individual agreements  
x Publication and/or public presentations  
 When will the data be shared?  x At the time of publication or shortly thereafter  
 
9.3 Exploratory whole- exome and RNA sequencing  
For active Expansion Arm  B patients enrolled at the time of Amendment P (11/2 /17) approval or 
thereafter, baseline, cycle  1 day 8, and progression/“restaging follow-up” tumor biopsy tissue 
remaining after completion of PD biomarker analyses will be used for exploratory whole -exome 
sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNA- seq) as appropriate to identify tumor genomic 
alterations and gene expression patterns potenti ally associated with AZD1775 antitumor activity, 
including loss of function mutations in SETD2
30 and amplification or overexpression of CCNE1 
or MYC29.  Baseline and cycle 1 day 8 blood samples will also be collected for sequencing to 
enable comparison of tumor and germline sequences.  Tissue specimens used for sequencing 
analyses will be de-identified, with only limited clinical annotation (e.g., response to AZD1775) maintained for each specimen.  Active Expansion Arm  B patients already enrolled at the time of 
Amendment P approval will be re- consented to the new, “genetic analysis” consent for m prior to 
use of their specimens for exploratory sequencing, and, if both pre- and post- biopsies have 
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 57 already been collected from such patients, a blood sample will be collected at time of re -consent 
for germline DNA analysis, as described below.   
 Biop sy cores and tissue sections are to be used for exploratory WES or RNA -seq only after PD 
biomarker analyses have been completed.  Tissue availability will be tracked in real time using Labmatrix.  Although the MoCha Laboratory is CLIA- certified, these sequ encing studies will not 
be done per CLIA specifications as the data are not returned to the patients or used for clinical decision making.  WES analysis will be prioritized over RNA- seq (see “Biopsy specimen use 
prioritization ” diagram, below).  WES and RNA-seq analysis of both baseline and cycle 1 day 8 
tumor tissue specimens is preferred; however, WES may be performed for a sample from only one time point depending on tissue availability.  RNA-seq may be performed for baseline specimens only if no cycle 1 day 8 tissue is available.  
Biopsy specimen use prioritization  
 
 
 
9.3.1 Tumor samples  
Biopsy tissue suitable for exploratory sequencing analyses includes frozen or FFPE tumor biopsy cores (< 1 core per sequencing run) or a series of slide -mounted FFPE tumor tissue 
sections (approximately 20 4 µ m-thick tumor sections per sequencing run). 
 For all patients, frozen  (cores)  or FFPE (cores or slides) tumor tissue will be s ubmitted for 
genetic analyses to  the MoCha Laboratory.  Samples labeled with unique patient IDs only 
will be transferred directly from PADIS to Dr. Mickey Williams’ laboratory.  Do NOT include patient identifiers (e.g., medical record number, patient name, or initials) with the samples.

 58 The biopsy specimen will be extracted for nucleic acids using the Qiagen FFPET All- Prep 
procedure.  DNA  and RNA will be assessed for quan tity and quality by spectroscopy 
(OD 260/280) and a PCR- based amplification quality assessment test.  All specimens that 
meet necessary quantity and quality criteria will be used for whole-exome and RNA 
sequencing as appropriate.  
9.3.2 Blood samples 
Optional whole blood samples will be collected at baseline and cycle 1 day 8 to obtain mononuclear cells.  The nucleic acid extracted from the patient’s mononuclear cells will be sequenced to compare somatic mutational status to the tumor biopsy specimen.  For active Expansion Arm B patients already enrolled at the time of Amendment P approval who are re -
consented to the new, “genetic analysis” consent form after both pre- and post - biopsies have 
already been collected, an optional blood sample will be collected at ti me of re -consent.  
 One 7 -mL K3 EDTA tube should be collected on the same day as the biopsy (either before or 
after the biopsy  procedure) and shippe d at ambient temperature.  S amples should be labeled 
with only the unique patient ID.  Do NOT include patient  identifiers (e.g., medical record 
number, patient name, or initials) with the samples.  
 Shipment of blood samples should be by CSP Courier and may be arranged by contacting Jenn Bangh, FNLCR, Tel.: 301-846-5893.  Samples should be sent to:

10 STUDY CALENDAR  
Eligibility screening evaluations are to be performed within 8 days prior to enrollment, with 
the exception of tumor imaging scans which must be performed within 28 days prior to enrollment (see Section 3.4).  Baseline history, physical examination, laboratory evaluations, urinalysis, and E CG are to be conducted within 8 days prior to start of protocol therapy.  If 
protocol therapy is started within 8 days of the screening evaluations, the screening evaluations may be used as baseline measurements.  If >8 days have passed since the screening evaluations, the medical history, physical examination, laboratory evaluations, urinalysis, and E CG must be repeated prior to starting protocol therapy.  Scans/x -rays and 
ECHO must be done within 28 days prior to the start of protocol therapy.   In the event that 
the patient’s condition is deteriorating, laboratory evaluations should be repeated within 48 hours prior to initiation of the next cycle of therapy.   Start of next cycle may be delayed for 
up to 1 week to accommodate scheduling conflicts.  For cycle 2 and beyond, history , physical

expansion arm .  For patients enrolled on Arm  B at once daily dosing, tumor biopsies will remain optional until 
the maximum tolera ted daily dosing is established, at which point up to 20 additional patients will be enrolled 
and tumor biopsies will be mandatory.   With Amendment P (11/2/17), on the day of each biopsy procedure 
(either before or after the biopsy procedure), an optional  blood sample should be collected into a 7-mL K3 
EDTA tube for exploratory sequencing analyses  (see Section 9.3.2 ).

l: Values from eligibility screening tests may be used as baseline evaluation  values if the test was performed 
within 8 days of start of protocol therapy (or, for radiologic evaluation and tumor measurement, within 28 
days of start of protocol therapy).  See Section  3.4 and Section 5 . 
 
 
11 MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
11.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
Although response is not the primary endpoint of this trial, patients with measurable 
disease will be assessed by standard criteria.   For the purposes of this study, patient s 
should be re- evaluated for response every 6 weeks (every 2 cycles ; 3 or 4 cycles for 
patients  on study more than one or three years, respectively ).  In addition to a baseline 
scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained at least 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response.  
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 62 Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria  proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
guideline (version 1.1 ) [Eur J Ca 45:228-247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter 
(unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
11.1.1 Definitions  
Evaluable for toxicity :  All patients will be evaluab le for toxicity from the time of 
their first treatment with AZD1775 . 
 
Evaluable for objective response :  Only those patients who have measurable 
disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluat ed will be considered evaluable for response.  These 
patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered eva luable.) 
 
Evaluable Non- Target Disease Response:  Patients who have lesions present at 
baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for non- target disease.  The response 
assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
11.1.2 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease :  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm by chest x- ray or as >10 mm with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical 
exam.  All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal 
fractions of centimeters).  
 
Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be > 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT 
scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease :  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 
mm short axis), are considered non- measurable disease.  Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non- measurable.  
 
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 63 Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple 
cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts.  
 ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ 
and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be 
selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable 
dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions :  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of 
these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
11.2 Guidelines  for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination un less the lesion(s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 
Clinical lesions :  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as 
assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 64  
Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI:  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  If CT scans have 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body 
scans).   
 As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specificatio ns of the scanning 
sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow- up should be the same as was used 
at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
PET- CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET- CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET- CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
Ultrasound:   Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised.  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be usef ul to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
 
Tumor markers :  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published 
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 65 [JNCI  96:487-488, 2004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461-3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148-1159, 
2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-125 
progression criteria which are to be integrated with object ive tumor assessment for use in 
first- line trials in ovarian cancer [JNCI  92:1534-1535, 2000]. 
 
Cytology, Histology:  These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual les ions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). 
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 FDG- PET:
  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative F DG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG- PET at follow -up:  If the positive 
FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this 
is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on CT, additional follow- up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is 
truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial ab normal FDG-PET scan).  If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up 
corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
c. FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner simil ar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by disease- specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both 
approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and 
biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
 Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
11.3 Response Criteria  
11.3.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) mu st have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm. 
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 66  
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum of diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters 
of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5  mm.  (Note:  the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). 
 
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters whi le on 
study. 
 
11.3.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph 
nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:    Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) 
and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non- target 
lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status chang e, not a 
single lesion increase.     
 
Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the 
opinion of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).  
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 67 11.3.3 Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the sm allest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The 
patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

*** In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non-target lesions may be accepted as 
disease progression.  
 
Note: Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring disc ontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

 68 11.4 Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first 
date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for prog ressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
Dura tion of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

this study does not meet GDS criteria, and no GDS  plan has been  developed. 
13 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
13.1.1 Primary Endpoints  
The primary objectives are:  
• To es tablish the safety  and tolerability of single agent AZD1775 in patients 
with refractory solid tumors.  
• To determine the pharmacokinetics of AZD1775 in patients with refractory 
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 71 solid tumors.  
13.1.2 Secondary Endpoint 
 The secondary objective is: 
 
• To evaluate the an titumor activity of AZD1775 in patients with refractory 
solid tumors.  
13.1.3 Exploratory Endpoints  
The exploratory objectives are:  
• To determine the effect of AZD1775 on pharmacodynamic markers of DNA 
damage and apoptosis in tumor tissue and blood.  
• To assess wheth er sufficient Wee1 inhibition is maintained throughout the 
therapeutic regimen.  
• To identify tumor genomic alterations and gene expression patterns potentially associated with AZD1775 antitumor activity. 
 
13.2 Study Design This Phase I study will use a standard 3+ 3 design, and permits intra-patient dose 
modification (defined in Section 5.1 ).  The MTD or recommended Phase II dose is the 
dose level at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experience DLT during the first cycle of treatment, and th e dose below that at which at least 2 (of < 6) patients have DLT as a 
result of the drug. 
13.3 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
With Amendment E ( dated 09/24/2013), an additional expansion arm  of 6 patients with 
documented tumors harboring BRCA- 1 or- 2 mutations will a lso be enrolled at the MTD 
to further explore the safety of AZD1775 and obtain preliminary evidence of activity in this patient population.  This information may inform patient selection for further 
development of this agent.  With Amendment G (dated 0 7/17/2014) a n additional Arm  B will be established to 
further evaluate an alternative once -daily dosing schedule.  Patients will be enrolled 
based on the standard 3+3 design.  Once the maximum tolerated daily dosing is established, up to 20 additional patients will be enrolled at this dose to further evaluate PD endpoints.  With that number, and a tumor biopsy QA criteria failure rate of 40% with respect to paired (pre - and post-dose) biopsies, we have an 87% likelihood of having at 
least 10 usable PD samples, and 94% likelihood of having at least 9 usable samples.  Biopsy tissue quality will be monitored and accrual will stop once we have obtained 10 usable paired samples.  
 The study is a standard design using 3 patients per arm , unless DLT is noted, in which 
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 72 point up to 6 patients may be enrolled in an arm .  Up to 30 patients will be enrolled for 
determination of the MTD.   In addition, an additional 6 patients will be enrolled at the 
MTD to further define the dose and evaluate PD studies at this dose level  (Exp ansion 
Arm A).  To allow for a small number of patients who may not be evaluable, and the 
addition of Arm B, the accrual ceiling for this trial is set at 72 patients.  It is  anticipated 
that 2 -3 patients per month may be enrolled onto this study.  Depending on the number of 
patients needed to reach MTD, it is expected that 24 -48 months will be required to accrue 
the number of patients necessary to complete the trial.  
13.4 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints  
We will assess the effect of AZD1775  on DNA damage respon se based on 
immunofluorescence analysis of markers of DNA damage,  Rad51, pNbs1, and γ H2AX in 
tumor biopsies, pTyr15- Cdk, and caspase 3 in CTCs as a marker of apoptosis.  
13.5 Reporting and Exclusions  
13.5.1 Evaluation of toxicity – All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of 
their first treatment with study agents.  
13.5.2 Evaluation of response  – All patients included in the study will be assessed for  
response to treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if 
they are ineligible.  Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories: 1) complete response, 2) p artial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive 
disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient  
data).   [Note: By arbitrary convention, category 9 usually designates the 
“unknown” status of any type of data in a clinical database.] 
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those who received no study medication) will be included in the main analysis of the response rate.   Patients in response categories 4 -9 will be considered to have a 
treatment failure (disease progression).  Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or  
drug administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate.  Precise definitions for categories 4 -9 will be protocol specific.  
 All conclusions will be based on all eligible patients.  Sub -analyses may then be 
performed on the basis of a subset of patients, excluding those for whom major protocol deviations have been identified (e.g., early death due to other reasons, early discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc.).  However,  
these sub -analyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning  
treatment efficacy, and the reasons f or excluding patients from the analysis will 
be clearly reported.  The 95% confidence intervals will also be provided.

 73 14 HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTIONS  
14.1 Justification for Subject Selection  
This study will be open to all individuals regardless of gender, ethnici ty, or race, 
provided that  the aforementioned inclusion and exclusion criteria are met.   Patients for 
this study will be recruited through internal referral, our physician referral base, and 
through various cancer information hotlines (i.e., Clinical Studies Support Center, 1-800-
4Cancer).  To date, there is no information that suggests that differences in drug metabolism or effect on tumor would be  expected in one ethnic group compared to 
another.  Efforts will be made to extend accrual to  each representat ive population, but a 
balance must be struck between participant safety  considerations and limitations on the 
number of individuals exposed to potentially ineffective treatments on the one hand and the need to explore racial/ethnic aspects of clinical rese arch on the other hand.  If 
differences in outcome that correlate to ethnic identity are noted, a follow -up study may 
be written to investigate those differences more fully.  
 Due to lack of knowledge of the effects of AZD1775 on the fetus or infants, as we ll as 
the possibility of teratogenic effects, pregnant and nursing women will be excluded from this trial.  Patients with unstable or serious medical conditions are excluded due to the possibility that  AZD1775 may worsen their condition and the likelihood that the  
underlying condition may obscure the attribution of adverse events to AZD1775.  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible PK interactions with  AZD1775 . 
14.1.1 Participation of Children  
This study includes patients 18 years of age and older.  Because insufficient 
dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of  AZD1775 in 
patients <18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but may be eligible for future pediat ric trials.  Studies will be performed in patients <18 years 
of age when it is  appropriate to do so. 
14.2 Evaluation of Benefits and Risks/Discomforts  
There may or may not be any clinical benefit to a patient from participation in this trial.  Their  participation will benefit future cancer patients.  Potential risks include the possible 
occurrence of any of a range of side effects that are listed in the consent document.  The 
procedure for protecting against or minimizing risks will be to medically evaluate patients as described in  Sections 5 and 6
.  Although no compensation is available, any 
injury will be fully evaluated and  treated in keeping with the benefits or care to which 
participants are entitled under applicable regulations. 
 
All patients > 18 years old will be offered the opportunity to assign a substitute decision maker on the “NIH Advance Directive for Health Care and Medical Research Participation” form, so that another person can make decisions about their medical care if they become incapacitated or cognitively impaired.  The process for determining whether 
CTEP # 9350  
Clinical Center # 13-C-0032 
 
 74 adults who lose capacity to give consent may continue participation in this trial, with its 
heavy reliance on non-therapeutic endpoints and collection of research samples, will be on a case -by case basis and will include consultation among the substitute decision 
maker, protocol PI, and patient’s physician regarding the health of the patient and likelihood of benefit from continued treatment.  
 
14.3 Consent and A ssent Process and Documentation  
An associate or principal investigator on the trial will inform patients of the purpose, alternatives,  drug administration plan, research objectives, and follow- up of this trial.  
The patient will be  provided an IRB-approved consent for review and signature and 
his/her questions will be answered.  After a decision is made to enroll into the study, a 
signature will be obtained from the  patient.   The original signed consent goes to Medical 
Records; a copy will be placed in the research record.  
 
All patients must have a signed informed consent form and an on- study (confirmation of  
eligibility) form filled out and signed by a participating investigator before entering on study. 
14.4 Procedure for Protecting Against or Minimizing Any Po tential Risks  
All care will be taken to minimize side effects, but they can be unpredictable in nature and severity.  This study may involve risks to patients, which are currently unforeseeable.  All patients will be monitored for side effects from taking study medication.  This 
research  represents a greater than minimal risk to participants, but presents the prospect 
of direct benefit to individual subjects.  The research component of this study required to obtain up to 3 CT tumor biopsies 
confers radiatio n expos ure at an effective dose of  2.4 rem .  This dose is below NIH RSC 
guidelines and represents a slightly greater than minimal risk to patients.  
14.5 Patient Advocate 
The patients’ rights representative is available to patients receiving treatment on this 
protocol at the NIH Clinical Center at (301) 496 -2626 in Building 10 of the Clinical 
Research Center, Room  1-3521, on the Bethesda NIH campus.  Patients will be informed 
that they can contact the study PI or RN at any time with questions about their medical care, and that the patients’ rights  representative is also available to answer non -medical 
questions about the study.

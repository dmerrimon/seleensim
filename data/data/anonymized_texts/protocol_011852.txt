 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1. Primary Objectives   
 
 To evaluate the ability of 89Zr-df-IAB2M to detect localized, clinically significant (defined 
as: ≥ 0.5 cm3 with Gleason pattern ≥ 4) prostate cancer ( PCa).  
 
1.2. Secondary Objectives   
 
 To determine the correlation of 89Zr-df-IAB2M PET/CT findings with pathological 
features (i.e. Gleason pattern, diameter and PSMA -positivity).  
 To compare the in vivo  89Zr-df-IAB2M PET/CT and 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT  to 
mpMRI.  
 To determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value ( PPV), negative 
predictive value ( NPV ) of IAB2M to detect all pathologically identified PCa lesions that 
do not meet criteria for clinical significance (defined as: < 0.5 cm3 with Gleason  pattern < 
4). 
 Determine the proportion of IAB2M positivity ( as measured by SUV) versus lesion size, 
Gleason pattern, and PSA levels.  
 Determine ability of 89Zr-df-IAB2M PET/CT to identify extra -prostatic extension.  
 Determine ability of 89Zr-df-IAB2M PET/CT to identify lymph node or other extra -
prostatic involvement.  
 To determine the safety of 89Zr-df-IAB2M PET /CT and 68Ga -PSMA -HBED -CC PET /CT 
imaging.  
 
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1  Disease  
 
Localized PCa is presently evaluated by serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) sampling and 
transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, both of the latter being  
anatomic approaches. As a secretory protein, PSA does not provide anatomic details nor does 
it distinguish betwee n malignant or benign pathology. TRUS and MR imaging modalities are 
limited by their inability to identify and differentiate localized malignant tissue from common 
benign pathology, i.e., benign prostatic hyperplasia, inflammation, etc. Furthermore, the 
images created are poorly defined and subject to artifact. The present inability to clearly image 
and identify malignant tissue and to localize the site/s of disease leads to unnecessary biopsy 
of many patients [1,000,000 prostate biopsies per year in US] an d an inability to direct the 
biopsy towards any suspicious site/s. As a direct result, the substantial majority of prostate 
biopsies are negative, suggesting that there was no need for the biopsy or that the biopsy failed 
to sample the lesion1,2. Nevertheless, the biopsied patients are subject to potentially significant 
morbidity and even mortality3,4.  
 
An imaging modality that is abl e to selectively identify malignant prostatic tissue within the 
 
 2 
 gland, would allow for accurate , targeted biopsies of suspicious foci and would reduce 
unnecessary  biopsies in patients with benign pathologies. The modality would also allow for 
improved clin ical staging and risk stratification, improved monitoring of patients on active 
surveillance and improved targeting of focal therapy.  
 
Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA)  
 
PSMA is the single, most well -established, highly restricted prostate epithelial cell membrane 
antigen known5-12.  Although first thought to be entirely prostate -specific5,13,14, subsequent 
studies demonstrated that PSMA is also expressed by some brain astrocytes and cells of the 
small intestine, proximal  renal tubules and salivary glands9. However, the level of expression 
in thes e non -prostate tissues is between a hundred -fold to a thousand -fold less than in prostate 
tissue8 and the site of PSMA expression in these normal cells (brush border/luminal location) 
are not readily accessible to circulating antibodies because of the bloo d: brain barrier or, in the 
case of the epithelial locations, due to intervening cell layers, basement membrane and 
epithelial tight junctions.  
 
In contrast to other well -known prostate -restricted molecules such as PSA and prostatic acid 
phosphatase (PAP) , which are secretory proteins, PSMA is a type II integral cell -surface 
membrane protein that is not secreted. Pathology studies indicate that PSMA is expressed by 
virtually all prostate cancers15 and PSMA expression increases progressively in higher grade 
cancers, metastatic disease, and hormone -refractory prostate cancer7,9,10. These qualities make 
PSMA an ideal target for monoclonal antibody (mAb ) imaging and/or therapy.  
 
2.2  Investigational Agent  
 
Humanized J591 (h uJ591)  
 
The huJ591 mAb is a de -immunized monoclonal antibody directed at the extra cellular domain 
of human PSMA. h uJ591 was derived from murine J591 using Biovation’s DeImmuni zation 
technology (Biovation, Aberdeen, Scotland, UK). In this technology, individual amino acids 
in predicted B and T cell epitopes were replaced with alternative amino acids such that the 
murine epitope s are no longer immunogenic to  the human immune syste m.16 The modification 
results in a non -immunogenic antibody that may be administered to patients on multiple 
occasions and over long periods withou t inducing an immune response. h uJ591 is produced 
from NS0 cells by Lonza (Lonza Biologics, Slough, UK).  
 
The humanized version of J591 has provided promising results in imaging both localized PCa 
and metastatic disease. Initial phase I/II studies using huJ591 trace -labeled with 111Indium 
(111In) and 177Lutitium (177Lu) using a DOTA chelate showed that repetitive dosing was well 
tolerated without the development of a human anti -humanized antibody (HAHA) response17-
22. No dose limiting to xicity occurred at imaging doses of radionuclide conjugates and the 
maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Excellent tumor targeting could be detected at all 
dose levels of the mAb. No mAb targeting to sites other than those involved by PCa was 
observed a lthough, as seen in other trials using radiometals, the liver is the primary site of 
 
 3 
 radiometal metabolism. Percent injected dose in the liver diminished with increasing dose of 
cold huJ591, and higher doses were associated with longer plasma clearance tim es.23-25  
 
Humanized J591 -Minibody (IAB2M)  
 
IAB2M is an engineered antibody fragment (derived from huJ591) that targets the extracellular 
domain of the PSMA. The intact parental huJ591 antibody demonstrated sufficient tumor 
uptake to be useful as an imaging and therapy agent17,26-29, however , the prolonged blood 
circulation time leads to increased background activity and radiation dose to normal organs 
thereby , somewhat limiting the imaging or therapeutic potential of these agents. Radiolabeled 
engineered antibody fragments have much faster c learance rates, providing improved tumor -
to-blood ratios30,31. However, fragments be low 60 kDa are filtered through the glomerul us, 
leading to significant renal excretory  activity32, which is an unfavorable characteristic for a 
PCa imaging agent as the radioa ctivity within the bladder interferes with imaging of the 
adjacent prostate. To address these issues, IAB2M was engineered by fusing VH -linker -VL-
CH3 gene segments, producing a single -chain protein that self -assembles into a small, stable, 
bivalent imaging  agent with a molecular weight of approximately 80  kDa. The minibody 
format is half the size of complete, full -length antibodies, yet retains full bivalent binding to 
the target and is not excreted via the glomerulus.  
Previous studies with a radiolabeled m inibody demonstrates rapid biodistribution, efficient 
target penetration, and rapid blood/background clearance due to the smaller size, allowing 
high-contrast images to be obtained within hours after injection33-35 compared to the current 
delay of se veral days to a week when intact antibodies are used for imaging36. The lack of CH2 
domain in the min ibody format removes antibody effector functions, removes FcRn -mediated 
prolongation of plasma half -life, and the risk of an immunologic response such as complement -
dependent cytotoxicity is reduced  to negligible . For functional imaging purposes, IAB2M is 
conjugated to desferrioxamine (Df) and radiometal labeled with 89Zr (T ½   78.41 hours).  The 
end product, 89Zr-df-IAB2M, is non -immunogenic, recognizes an extracellular target, is not 
excreted via the kidney, and exhibits rapid kinetics desirable for imagi ng. 
 
Engineering the IAB2M Minibody  
 
The DNA sequences of the heavy and light chains for the humanized anti -PSMA antibody 
huJ591 were provided by Dr. Neil H. Bander (Weill Cornell Medical College). ImaginAb , the 
creators and IND owners of IAB2M,  re-humanized the DNA sequences using a later generation 
approach.  The variable genes from the heavy and light chain DNA were separately amplified 
and joined together by overlap PCR to form a single -chain Fv (scFv) with an 18 amino acid 
linker. This scFv fragment was subsequently fused to the human IgG1 CH3 domain via the 
human IgG1 hinge sequence by overlap PCR to form the complete minibody (scFv -CH3 
dimer) construct (see Figure 1).  
 
 5 
 During the last two decades, many efforts have been undertaken to develop PSMA -
ligands43,44. One of these ligands, the small molecule Glu -NH-CO-NH-Lys-(Ahx) -
[68Ga(HBED -CC)], a lso known as PSMA -11®, PSMAHBED, Glu -CO-Lys(Ahx) -HBED -
CC, DKFZ -PSMA -11, PSMA -HBED - CC, PSMA -HBED, PSMA or ProstamedixTM, 
developed at the German Cancer Research Center Heidelberg (DKFZ), has become the 
most clinically used radiotracer. This compound shows a strong binding affinity to PSMA 
as well as a highly efficient internalization into PCa cells45,46. PET/CT -imaging with 68Ga-
PSMA -11 has demonstrated this novel method as an important imaging modality for 
diagnosing recurrent PCa37,47-49. Perera et al., did systematic review of 68Ga-PET articles  
and Sixteen articles involving 1309 patients were analyzed. On per -patient analysis, the 
summary sensitivity and specificity were both 86%. On per lesion analysis, the summary 
sensitivity and specificity were 80% and 97%, respectively50. 
 
ABX Advanced Biochemical Compounds, Radeberg, Germany produces PSMA -HBED -
CC for clinical use . Upon purchase and shipment to Weill Cornell Medicine, the peptid e 
will be labeled with 68Ga with the final product being 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC. 
Radionuclide conjugation will be done at the Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department 
of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medicine.  
 
The material produced are subjected to quality assuran ce testing as outlined in the Food 
and Drug Administration “Points to Consider”. All production data and supporting 
documents, together with the results of all quality assurance testing, have been provided to 
and reviewed by the Food and Drug Administratio n (68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC, IND# 
124495) . 
 
 
2.3  Rationale   
 
 89Zr-df-IAB2M for PCa imaging/diagnosis  
 
An ad -hoc analysis of data from 18 subjects with metastatic PCa showed that the 
combination of conventional imaging (CT, bone scan, FDG PET) and 89Zr-df-IAB2M PET 
imaging identified a total of 168 lesions (152 bone lesions and 16 soft tissue lesions). 
Thirty -four of these 168 lesions (32 bone lesions and two soft tissues lesions) were 
identified by 89Zr-df-IAB2M PET but not by conventional imaging. A tota l of 13  biopsies 
in these 18 patients confirmed true -positive identification of lesions in 11 of 11 locations 
and true -negative identification in one of two locations using 89Zr-df-IAB2M compared 
with nine of 11 positive lesions and two of two negative les ions correctly identified by 
FDG PET. This improved sensitivity and specificity illustrates the potential of 89Zr-df-
IAB2M PET to provide clinicians with actionable information that may improve the 
accuracy of diagnosis, staging of the disease, risk strati fication, and treatment decision -
making.   
 
Further review of 89Zr-df-IAB2M PET/CT by an independent third -party core lab was 
undertaken to determine the ideal unlabeled protein dose(10, 20 and 50 mg) and timing of 
 
 6 
 optimal imaging for lesion detection. This un -blinded analysis revealed predominantly 
pelvic and lumbar spinal bone metastases and nodal metastases detection in the 18 subject 
cohort. Based on both estimated lesion detection rate, PET/CT activity and reader 
preference, the 48 hour imaging time  point was determined to be the best time point for 
lesion detection and quantitation, while the time points from 24 hours through 96 hours 
demonstrated comparable qualitative and quantitative results to the 48 hour time point.  
Increasing unlabeled antibo dy affected the time course of detection of prostate metastases 
in all tissues examined, with the 10 mg cohort demonstrating the most sensitivity for lesion 
detection and quantitation. These results suggested that 89Zr-df-IAB2M can be an effective 
probe fo r the PCa marker PSMA and provide a robust imaging scan to better detect PCa 
tumor burden.  
 
Amendment v3 (01/27/17) : 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC for PCa imaging/diagnosis : 
Results from selective clinical trials using 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC to evaluate its diagnositic 
value are reported here under:  
 
a) Diagnostic value of 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT imaging in the diagnosis 
of recurrent prostate cancer48: 
 
The study reports data from a retrospective analysis of 319 patients who underwent 
68Ga-PSMA -ligand PET/CT from 2011 to 2014. The 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC solution 
was applied to the respective patient via an intravenous bolus injection (mean of 172.4 
MBq ±70.9, range 40 – 400 MBq, med ian 161 MBq). A non -contrast -enhanced CT 
scan was performed 1 -hour post tracer injection. Histological verification was 
performed in 42 patients after the 68Ga-PSMA -ligand PET/CT. Tracer uptake was 
measured in 901 representative tumor lesions. 82.8% of the  patients had at least one 
lesion indicative of PCa was detected. Tumor -detection was positively associated with 
PSA level and Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Gelason Score and PSA 
doubling time (PSA -DT) were not associated with tumor -detection. The av erage 
maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of tumor lesions was 13.3 ± 14.6 (0.7 -
122.5). Amongst lesions investigated by histology, 30 were false -negative in 4 
different patients, and all other lesions (n = 416) were true -positive or true -negative. 
A lesion -based analysis of sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and 
positive predictive value (PPV) revealed values of 76.6%, 100%, 91. 4% and 100%. A 
patient -based analysis revealed a sensitivity of 88.1%.  
 
b)  PET imaging with a 68Ga-PSMA ligand for the diagnosis of prostate cancer: 
biodistribution in humans and first evaluation of tumor lesions 51: 
 
Initial clinical studies with the 68Ga-labeled PSMA -HBED -CC were conducted at 
Heidelberg University Hospital and the German Cancer Research Center to assess 
 
 7 
 the biodistribution of 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC in normal tissues and tumor lesions. 
A total of 37 patients with prostate cancer and rising PSA levels were subjected to 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT imaging. Quantitative assessment of tracer 
uptake was performed 1 and 3 h post -injection by analysis of mean and maximum 
standardized uptake values (SUVmean/max) of several organs and 65 tumor 
lesions. Subsequently, tumor to bac kground ratios were calculated.  
 
The 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT images showed intense tracer uptake in both 
kidneys and salivary glands. Moderate uptake was seen in lacrimal glands, liver, 
spleen and in small and large bowel. Quantitative assessment revealed  excellent 
contrast between tumor lesions and most normal tissues. Of 37 patients, 31 (83.8 
%) showed at least one lesion suspicious for cancer at a detection rate of 60 % at 
PSA <2.2 ng/ml and 100 % at PSA >2.2 ng/ml. Median tumor to background ratios 
were 18.8 (2.4 -158.3) in early images and 28.3 (2.9 -224.0) in late images. Within 
healthy organs, kidneys and salivary glands demonstrated the highest radiotracer 
uptake. Lesions suspicious for prostate cancer presented with excellent contrast as 
early as 1 -hour after injection with high detection rates even at low PSA levels.  
 
c) 68Ga-labeled PSMA ligand as superior PET tracer for the diagnosis of 
prostate cancer: Comparison with 18F-FECH 39: 
 
This study was also published by the Heidelberg group, compared 68Ga-PSMA - 
HBED -CC PET/CT imaging to standard choline -based PET/CT. Thirty -seven 
patients with biochemical relapse of prostate cancer [mean prostate -specific 
antigen (PSA) 11.1 ± 24.1 ng/ml, r ange 0.01 -116] were retrospectively analyzed 
after 18F- fluoromethylcholine and 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT within a time window of 
30 days. Radiotracer uptake that was visually considered as prostate cancer was 
semi - quantitatively analyzed by measuring the maximum standardized uptake 
values (SUVmax) of the scans acquired 1 -hour after injection of 68Ga-PSMA 
complex solution (median 132 MBq, range 59 -263 MBq) and 18F-
fluoromethylcholine (median 237 MBq, range 114 -374 MBq), respectively. In 
addition, tumor to backgroun d ratios were calculated.  
 
The results showed a total of 78 lesions characteristic for prostate cancer that were 
detected in 32 patients using 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT imaging and 56 
lesions were detected in 26 patients using choline PET/CT. The higher det ection 
rate in 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT imaging was statistically significant 
(p=0.04). In five patients, no lesion was found with both methods. All lesions 
detected by 18F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT were also seen by 68Ga-PSMA -
HBED -CC PET/CT imaging. In 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT imaging 
 
 8 
 SUVmax was clearly (>10 %) higher in 62 of 78 lesions (79.1 %) and the tumor 
to background ratio was clearly (>10 %) higher in 74 of 78 lesions (94.9 %) when 
compared to 18F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT.  
 
The authors concluded  that 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT can detect lesions 
characteristic for prostate cancer with improved contrast when compared to 
standard 18F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT, especially at low PSA levels.  
 
 
d) Comparison of PET/CT and PET/MRI hybrid systems using a 68Ga-labelled 
PSMA ligand for the diagnosis of recurrent prostate cancer:  initial experience  
47: 
 
In a more recent publication, the Heidelberg group evaluated the feasibility of 
PET/MRI imaging with 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC. Twenty patients underwent 
PET/CT 1 -hour after injection of the 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC followed by 
PET/MRI 3 -hours after injection. Data from the two investigations were first 
analyzed separately and then compared with respect to tumor detectio n rate and 
radiotracer uptake in various tissues. To evaluate the quantification accuracy of 
the PET/MRI system, differences in SUVs between PET/CT and corresponding 
PET/MRI were compared with differences in SUVs between PET/CT 1 -hour and 
3-hours after inj ection in another patient cohort. This cohort was investigated 
using the same PET/CT system.  With PET/MRI, different diagnostic sequences, 
higher contrast of lesions and higher resolution of MRI enabled a subjectively 
easier evaluation of the images. In a ddition, four unclear findings on PET/CT 
could be clarified as characteristic of prostate cancer metastases by PET/MRI. 
However, in PET images of the PET/MRI, a reduced signal was observed at the 
level of the kidneys (in 11 patients) and around the urinary  bladder (in 15 patients). 
This led to reduced SUVs in six lesions. SUVmean values provided by the 
PET/MRI system were different in muscles, blood pool, liver and spleen.  
 
The authors concluded that prostate cancer was detected more easily and more 
accurat ely with Ga -PSMA PET/MRI than with PET/CT and with lower radiation 
exposure. Consequently, this new technique could clarify unclear findings on 
PET/CT. However, scatter correction was challenging when the specific 68Ga-
PSMA -HBED -CC was used. Moreover, dire ct comparison of SUVs from PET/CT 
and PET/MR needs to be conducted carefully.  
These encouraging results  suggest 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC to be an effective probe for 
the PCa marker “PSMA ” in metastatic prostate cancer patients and that it can provide a 
robust imaging scan to  better detect PCa tumor burden. W e plan to utilize this probe to 
 
 9 
 better understand its diagnostic role in prostate cancer  patients with localized disease . 
 
 
2.4 Correlative Studies Background  
 
 Imaging Modalities for the evaluation of Prostate Cancer  
 
 Cross -Sectional Imaging  
 
The cross -sectional imaging modalities that are used to evaluate PCa include CT and MRI. 
The utility of each of these modalities varies according to the stage of disease. At present, 
neither of these modalities ca n reliably distinguish viable PCa from necrotic or nonmalignant 
tissue.  
 
CT: Does not effectively evaluate disease that is confined to the prostate and adjacent area. 
It is not sensitive enough to detect microscopic nodal disease or tumor in non -enlarged l ymph 
nodes.  
  
MRI: To provide the most accurate assessment of the extra -prostatic region, neurovascular 
bundles, and seminal vesicles, MRI is considered the modality of choice. However, MRI is 
limited by multiple sophisticated post -imaging processes and until recently has not been 
standardized52. MRI can detect soft tissue disease and is most useful to corroborate bone 
scintigraphy findings (particu larly when the earliest involvement is thought to be present in 
the bone marrow). MRI is most sensitive  in the axial skeleton and pelvis, and is less effective 
in the ribs, chest wall, and skull. Multiple studies have demonstrated the inability of current 
multi -parametric MRI to supplant the need for TRUS guided biopsy in the diagnostic or 
surveillance setting53-55. 
 
 Functional imaging/Positron Emission Tomography (PET)  
 
PET has advantages over conventional imaging methods because it quantitatively assesses 
biologic processes in vivo  and can assess different processes using specific radiotracers. 
Processes that can be analyzed include glucose and amino acid metabolism, proliferation, 
blood flow, and biomarker/receptor status (i.e., androgen receptor, PSMA, etc). Most studies, 
however,  have focused on the accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Functional 
imaging has not yet added significant value to the management of PCa.  
 
PET scanning with 89Zr-df-IAB2M:  89Zr is an attractive radiometal for use in immuno -
PET because of its physical half -life of 78.41 hours, which is well matched to the 
pharmacokinetics of the minibody. 89Zr is cyclotron produced, has favorable chemistry 
allowing linkage to Df -IAB2M with high  yields, maintaining high radiochemical purity and 
stability without compromising  minibody binding affinity.   
 
 
Amendment v 3 (01 /27/17):

PET scanning with 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC: A similar opportunity exists to bring 
clinically important PET tracer(s) into widespread clinical use readily and inexpensively, 
through the use of generator -produced Gallium -68 (Ga -68), a positron emitting radionuclide 
with a 68 minutes half -life. Due to the high cost of establishing and maintaining cyclotron 
and elaborate radiochemistry facilities, generator -produced positron -emitting radionuclides 
such as Ga -68 have become an attractive alternative to F -18 (Fluorine -18). Ga -68 has come 
to be a relevant r adionuclide for routine clinical examinations, especially in Europe, due to 
the commercial availability of Germanium (Ge -68)/ Gallium -68 (Ga -68) generators (271 
days half -life) that allow obtaining Ga -68 on -site without the need for a cyclotron. The Ge -
68 /Ga-68 generator can be used for up to 1 year and the equilibrium between Ga -68 and Ge -
68 is rapidly re - established allowing multiple radiotracer preparations in a day from a single 
generator .

6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
Not applicable.  
 
 
7. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
investigator will be required to provide appropriate information concerning any findings that 
suggest significant hazards, contraindications, side effects, or precautions pertinent to  the safe 
use of the drug under investigation.  Safety will be monitored by evaluation of adverse events 
reported by patients or observed by investigators or research staff, as well as by other 
investigations such as clinical laboratory tests, x -rays, elec trocardiographs, etc.  
 
7.1  89Zr-df-IAB2M  Potential Risks   
 
There are no known contraindications for 89Zr-df-IAB2M.  No drug related adverse events 
were reported in the Phase I study.  Because of the potential for infusion or allergic reaction, 
the subject  should be monitored for safety for one hour following the infusion.  
 
The 14 day sterility testing will not be completed at the time of 89Zr-df-IAB2M infusion. The 
89Zr-df-IAB2M dose will be released based on the controlled process along with a history of 
sterile lots. If a sterility test becomes positive any time during the 14 -day period, the 
Investigator will be notified immediately.  The subject who received the 89Zr-df-IAB2M will 
be contacted and requested to have an office visit including blood culture s and, if clinically 
indicated, started on broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics (Vancomycin and Imipenem).  
 
Radiation Dosimetry :  89Zr and the CT component of the PET/CT study expose patients to 
ionizing radiation.  
In the phase I/IIa study 18 patients r eceived a total of four PET scans. For each PET scan 
(considered discrete time points) the radioactivity levels in the brain, lungs, heart, liver, 
gallbladder, kidneys, intestines, urinary bladder and whole body were obtained and recorded.  
Time activity c urves were generated, fit to an exponential model using the OLINDA/EXM 
software, and the number of disintegrations in the source organs were determined and used to 
estimate the organ radiation dose. The radiation doses estimates are shown in Table 1.  
The lower large intestinal wall received the largest estimated dose (2.0± 0.78mSv/MBq) 
followed by the liver (1.74± 0.68 mSv/MBq) and the kidneys (1.56± 0.48 mSv/MBq).  The 
Effective Dose was 0.687 ± 0.141 mSv/MBq , thereby result ing in an estimated Effective Do se 
of 63.5 mSv for the anticipated 2.5 mCi injection  in the present trial .

9. IMAGING AND SPECIAL STUDIES  
 
9.1 Imaging and histopathology  
 
9.1.1  3T multi -parametric pelvic MRI  
 
9.1.1.1  Method of Assessment  
   
3T mpMRI preoperative images will be read by GU radiologist reporting: location, size 
and features of lesions suspicious for PCa.  Lesional criteria on MR are defined as being 
well-circums cribed with low signal intensity on T2 weighted images with associated 
diffusion restriction on ADC maps.  Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MR imaging 
on preoperative images will also be evaluated subjectively for early and intense 
enhancement followed by ra pid washout, findings that are all associated with prostate 
cancer.  The radiologist will have access to TRUS biopsy results.  
 
An MR /lesional analysis will be performed.  Lesional criteria on MR will be defined 
as well -circumsribed low signal intensity o n T2 weighted images with associated 
diffusion restriction on ADC maps.  Dynamic contrast enhanced MR imaging on 
preoperative images will also be evaluated subjectively for early and intense 
enhancement followed by rapid washout, findings that are all char acteristic of prostate 
cancer.   
   
9.1.1.2  Timing of Assessment  
 
Will be performed within six weeks prior to or on Visit 3.  The investigators will 
attempt to schedule the mpMR as close to the date of the PET/CT so that the post -
TRUS biopsy changes do not confound the differences between the two imaging 
modalities.   
 
 
9.1.2  89Zr-df-IAB2M PET /CT imaging  
 
9.1.2.1 Method of Assessment  
 
PET/CT will be read twice by a nuclear medicine physician. For the first interpretation, 
the physician will be  blinded from clinical history , biopsy results  and conventional 
 
 21 
 imaging modalities. After the initial reading, the nuclear medicine physician will be 
provided with both the TRUS biopsy results and previously read scans  for the repeat 
PET/CT reading . During each interpretation, the physician will record all abnormal, 
suspicious areas with higher uptake than adjacent or contralateral bac kground. Each 
abnormal area will be recorded on a map of the prostate along with maximum 
standardized uptake value (SUV max) and mean standardized uptake value (SUV mean).  
 
Subsequently, the accumulation of 89Zr-df-IAB2M  will be compared to areas of known 
PCa foci on histopathology and mpMRI , as described in Section 13 . After completion 
of the histopathology, the PET/CT findings will be compared to histopathology to 
perform a lesion by lesion analysis with histopathology serving as the reference gold 
standard.  This analysis will primarily include tumors ≥ 0.5 cm3 on histopathology, with 
a secondary assessment of any lesions <0.5 cm3. Similarly, areas of increased uptake 
identified on IAB2M , which had been read as suspicious for cancer will be compared  
to histopathology to determine the underlying pathology  (e.g., inflammation, benign 
prostatic hyperplasia) . 
 
9.1.2.2 Timing of Assessment  
 
Infusion of 89Zr-df-IAB2M will occur during Visit 2 . Imaging will be performed  2-3 
days after the injection  on Visit  3. Please refer to the Calendar of Events (Section10).  
 
9.1.3  68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT imaging  
 
Patient preparation should be according to the policies and procedures of the local 
imaging site (CIBC). The patient does not need to be fasting for either the infusion or 
the scans. The use of intravenous or oral contrast will not be permitted. Specificat ions 
for acquiring the 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT scans will be provided in study 
specific documentation by the study chair or the co -investigators from the Division of 
Nuclear Medicine. PET/CT images are acquired between 1 and 3 hours after the 68Ga-
PSMA -HBED-CC infusion. Image acquisition will be from vertex of skull to mid 
thighs.  The subject will be scheduled for the injection and imaging between screening 
and prostatectomy depending on subjects’  availability and compliance.  
 
9.1.4 Histopathology  
 
9.1.4.1 Method of Assessment  
 
All patients will undergo radical prostatectomy and potential lymph node dissection. 
The prostate gland will be fixed in formalin for 12 -24 hours at room temperature. After 
fixation, the gland will be processed according to standard institutional protocol, as 
follows:  
 
1) Weigh the prostate gland with attached seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia  
 
2) Measure the prostate, seminal vesicles, and vasa deferentia  
 
 22 
  
3) Orient the gland. Note and describe any nodularities or asymmetry to the  gland; 
tissue disruptions ; defects ; or surface irregularities; adherent tissues/organs, etc.  
 
4) Ink the entire specimen —green on the right side and black on the left.  
 
5) Amputate both seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia at their attachment to the 
prostate and submit the most proximal portion of each for histology (i.e., submit 
the portion of SV/VD nearest their juncture with the prostate).  
 
6) Amputate the most distal (apical) 5 -7 mm of the gland. Place the broad cut 
surface of this “cone” of tissu e onto the table and section perpendicularly to the 
midline (into ~3 mm strips). Submit the strips on “edge” for margin (ink) 
evaluation. When submitting, if the strips are not too long, leave the left and right 
sides connected and submit the anterior and posterior halves separately (e.g., A2 -
anterior apex, A3 -posterior apex). If the strips are too long to fit into a cassette, 
divide the strips into left and right halves. Maintain the separation of anterior and 
posterior halves and designate appropriately i n the summary of sections (e.g., A2 -
left anterior apex, A3 -right anterior apex, A4 -left posterior apex, A5 - right posterior 
apex).  
 
7) Amputate the most proximal (basal) 5 -7 mm of the gland, which should include 
the bladder neck margin, and process this “c one” of tissue in the same manner as 
the apex (Step 6).  
 
8) Section the remaining prostate perpendicular to the urethra into 4 mm thick 
slices, starting at the apex and continuing towards the base until completely 
sectioned. Designate the slices/levels as A, B, C, etc., starting from the apex. 
Generally, an average 35 gram prostate should be sectioned into at least five levels 
(A to E).  
 
Sections to submit for histology: Right and left seminal vesicle and vas deferens 
(1-2 cassettes total, depending on size ); Bladder neck/base margin (2 -4 cassettes, 
divided as above); Apical margin (2 -4 cassettes, as above)  
 
Remaining prostate will be submitted as follows:  
Each slice/level is quadrisected into 1) left anterior 2) left posterior 3) right anterior 
and 4) right  posterior, as with the apex and base margins. However, DO NOT cut 
the slices/levels into strips; submit as intact quadrant pieces and designate in the 
summary of sections (e.g., left anterior slice A should be "LAA", and left posterior 
slice A  should be " LPA" and so forth).  
 
A pathologist, blinded to the imaging results, will independently review all slides. 
Cases will be reported according to standard pathologic procedures including the 
presence of tumor, Gleason score, extracapsular extension, and semina l vesicle 
invasion. In addition, using an  anatomical map of the prostate,  each individual tumor 
 
 23 
 focus will be outlined and annotated (location within the gland, tumor size, tumor stage, 
and Gleason score). Any other abnormal areas/findings within the speci men will also 
be annotated. Immunohistochemical assessment of PSMA expression and/or 
neuroendocrine features will be performed as specified in source documentation. A 
tabular list of all cancer lesions will be made for each patient based on size and/or sta ge 
of each tumor and listing Gleason score, stage, and location. This list will be used to 
review  and correlate with imaging findings on IAB2M PET/CT and mpMRI.  
 
9.1.3.2 Timing of Assessment  
 
Histopathologic specimen assessment will occur after Visit 4, radical prostatectomy . 
Please refer to the Calendar of Events (Section10).

a  Screening evaluation should be performed following informed consent and within 4 weeks before enrollment, 
except when noted otherwise. Evaluations performed as standard of care before informed consent but within the 
4-week window need not be repeated.   
b Concomitant medication refers to medication received by subjects from the point of signed informed consent 
through the end of Visit 6.   
c  Vital signs include height, weight, temperature, blood pressure and heart rate. Height and weight are obtained 
only at Visit 1. During the Infusion Visit 2, serial vital signs will be monitored pre -infusion, then 30 minutes 
 
 25 
 and 60 minutes post -infusion (±5 minutes).  
d Laboratory samples collected include Chemistry panel, CBC (hematology), PSA (first blood draw only),  and 
serum testosterone level (first blood draw only). All Screening laboratory samples are to be collected within 14 
days before enrollment or at Visit 2, Pre -infusion (serum testosterone level may be up to  4 weeks before 
enrollment or Visit 2, prior to 89Zr-df-IAB2M infusion ) and again at Visit 3.  
e Radiographic evaluations include a modified (3T multiparametric) MRI of the pelvis, if clinically indicated. 
Radiographic studies are to be performed within 6 weeks before, or on Visit 3/Day 2, provided the patient has 
not received a new intervening anti -cancer treatment.  
f Blood sample will be drawn via venipuncture for HAHA   evaluation pre -infusion at Visit 3and repeat samples 
will be taken at Visit 5 (week 6, +/ - 1 week).   
g 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC administratio n followed by PET/CT scan 1 – 3 hours later must be done prior to 89Zr-
df-IAB2M tracer administration on Visit 2 otherwise the 68Ga -PSMA -HBED -CC administration and PET/CT 
scan can be done anytime between screening and prostatectomy visit.  
 
11. DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Data Collection  
 
The data collection plan for this study is to utilize REDCap  to capture all treatment, 
toxicity, and efficacy data for all enrolled patients.   
 
            11.1.1 REDCap  
 
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a free data management software 
system that is fully supported by the Weill -Cornell Medical Center CTSC.  It is a tool 
for the creation of customized, secure data management systems that include Web -
based data -entry forms, repor ting tools, and a full array of security features including 
user and group based privileges, authentication using institution LDAP system, with a 
full audit trail of data manipulation and export procedures.  REDCap is maintained on 
CTSC -owned servers that are backed up nightly and support encrypted (SSL -based) 
connections.  Nationally, the software is developed, enhanced and supported through a 
multi -institutional consortium led by the Vanderbilt University CTSA.  
 
11.2  Regulatory Considerations  
 
All protocol amendments and consent form modifications will be made by the Principal 
Investigator.  
 
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
Data analysis and image interpretation will be performed in a manner similar to the strategy 
employed by Osborne et al. 58 and Turkbey B et al59, with both a lesion specific and sector -specific 
analysis.   For the sector -analysis, the prostate gland will be divided into segments as described in 
the START criteria58.  A lesion -based analysis will also be performed after review of 
histopathology.  
 
 26 
  
Sectors of the prostate gland as described by the START criteria, Moore C, et al.   
 
12.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
The present study is a phase II, open label, single -center, non -randomized, single -
dose study.  
 
Primary endpoints  
 
The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of subjects with PSMA -positive 
(identified by H&E staining and immunohistochemistry) "dominant"   PC lesion(s) 
greater than 5mm in diameter, whose lesion(s) have been successfully identified by 
89Zr-df-IAB2M imaging.  Because this is an exploratory pilot study, no formal sample 
size/power calculation is required.   However, with a sample size of 20 patients in the 
study, a two -sided 95% confidence interval for the proportion of patients successfully 
imaged b y 89Zr-df-IAB2M can be constructed to be within ± 19.0% of the observed 
proportion of patients with successful imaging by 89Zr-df-IAB2M.   This calculation 
assumes an 89Zr-df-IAB2M imaging -success proportion of 75%.   All estimates from 
the study will serve as preliminary data (i.e., hypothesis -generating) for future studies.   
 
o Descriptive statistics will be calculated for the study cohort:  
 
 Median and inter -quartile range or mean and standard deviation for age, 
biopsy Gleason score (1o, 2o, Total), number of cores on biopsy, number 
of positive cores on biopsy, PSA, number of lesions on prostatectomy 
pathology (RP pathology), lesion size on RP pathology, Gleason score 
(1o, 2o, and total) on RP pathology.  
 
o Lesion -based analysis:  

 
 27 
  
 SUV max measurements of 89Zr-df-IAB2M PET/CT images obtained in 
tumor and non -tumor regions will be compared. To account for 
intrapatient correlation of multiple lesions, a linear mixed -effect s model 
with a random intercept will be used to estimate and compare the mean 
SUV max values in different regions.  P<0.05 w ill be  indicative of a 
significant difference as described by Turkbey B, et al.59 
 
 Positive and negative predictive values will be estimated by using 
generalized estimating equations (GEE) modeling, with logit link 
function and a working independence correlation structure . Robust 
variance estimation and the delta method will be used to calculate 
standard errors of the positive and negative predictive values. The Wald 
test with robust variance estimates will be used for statistical inference.  
Subgroup analyses will be perfo rmed for high, moderate , and low risk 
disease (see secondary endpoints).  
 
 Receiver  operating curve  characteristics  (ROC)  will be constructed to 
determine the predictive ability of SUV level on detection of any disease  
and disease severity as correlated to  histopathology . 
 
Secondary endpoints  
 
 To determine the ability of in vivo  89Zr-df-IAb2M PET /CT to correlate with 
pathological features (i.e. Gleason pattern, diameter and PSMA -positivity) : 
 
o The Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare lesions that were and were 
not identified on in vivo  PET with respect to lesion size, immunohistoch emical 
PSMA staining , and Gleason score ( demonstrated by histo pathology ).  This 
lesion based analysis will be performed  in a similar fashion as described above . 
 
 To compare the in vivo  89Zr-df-IAb2M PET /CT and 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT 
to in vivo  mpMRI : 
 
o The diagnostic accuracy of 89Zr-df-IAB2M PET /CT and 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -
CC PET/CT imaging in patients with prostate cancer will be compared with that 
of mpMR I imaging by using sector -based analysis, as described by Turkbey B 
et al.59 The estimates of patient -specific sensitivity and specificity will be 
defined as the proportion of true -positive sectors and the proportion of true -
negative sectors in each patient. Overall sensitivity and specificity wi ll then be 
estimated by calculating the mean (and standard error) of these individual -
 
 28 
 specific estimates across patients. Differences in sensitivity and specificity 
between modalities will then be evaluated by  the Wilcoxon signed -rank test. 
 
 To determine t he sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV of IAB2M to detect all 
pathologically identified PCa lesions that do not meet criteria for clinical significance 
(defined as: < 0.5 cm3 with Gleason  pattern < 4) : 
 
o As above , but for lesions considered not to be clinically significant . 
 
 To correlate IAB2M positivity (SUV) and lesion size : 
  
o The Spearman -rank correlation coefficient will be used to evaluate the 
association between  SUV and size of the lesion  (procedure for size 
measurements are defined in Section 9. 1.3). 
 
 To correlate IAB2M positivity (SUV) and Gleason pattern  (3, 4 and 5 ): 
 
o The Spearman -rank correlation coefficient will be used to evaluate the 
association between correlate SUV and the histopathologically defined Gleason 
pattern .  The Wilcoxon rank-sum test will also be used to compare 
SUV max measurements between lesions with low Gleason score (3+4 or lower) 
and high Gleason score (4+3 or higher).  
 
 To correlate IAB2M positivity (SUV) and PSA: 
 
o The Spearman -rank correlation coefficient will be used to evaluat e the 
association between SUV and serum PSA levels  obtained during screening . 
 
 To d etermine the ability of in vivo  89Zr-df-IAB2M PET /CT to identify extra -prostatic 
extension : 
 
o The Wilcoxon rank -sum test will be used to compare SUV max measurements of 
IAB2M -positive extra -prostatic sites between lesions with and without 
histopathologically  confirmed  extra -prostatic exten sion.  
 
 To determine  the ability of in vivo  89Zr-df-IAB2M PET /CT to identify occult lymph 
node involvement : 
 
 
 29 
 o The Wilcoxon rank -sum test will be used to compare SUV max measurements of 
IAb2M -positive lymph nodes between patients with and without 
histopathologically confirmed  lymph node involvement.   
 
 To further evaluate the safety of 89ZR-DF-IAB2M PET /CT and 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -
CC imaging .  
 
o See section on Risks  
  
Additionally, we will assess whether there is improved sensitivity in detecting 
localized PCa  by combining imaging results. This assessment will be done by 
estimating the PPV with different combinations of imaging modalities.  The 
incremental effect of an additional imaging modality on PPV will be tested with 
the Wald test, as described by Turkbey B, et al.59 
 
All p -values will be two -sided with statistical significance evaluated at the 0.05 
alpha level.  All analyses will be performed in SAS Version 9.4 ( SAS Institute, Inc., 
Cary, NC) and Stata Version 13.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).  
 
12.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
The sample size for this study will be 20 patients. We anticipate an accrual rate of at 
least two patients per month.   With a sample size of 20 patients in the study, a two-
sided 95% confidence interval for the proportion of patients successfully imaged by 
89Zr-df-IAB2M can be constructed to be within ± 19.0% of the observed proportion of 
patients with successful imaging  by 89Zr-df-IAB2M.   This calculation assumes an 89Zr-
df-IAB2M imaging -success proportion of 75%.   All estimates from the study will serve 
as preliminary data (i.e., hypothesis -generating) for future studies.”  
 
12.3 Stratification Factors  
 
No stratification  factors.  However, an  interim analysis and efficacy determination 
based on the primary endpoint will be performed after the first 10 patients have 
completed Visit 4 and subsequent histopathological analysis has been performed on the 
prostate specimen.

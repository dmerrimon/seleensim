WHAT IS THE  PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?  
 
This is a research study.  We are inviting you to participate in this research study because you  have been 
diagnosed with a tumor such as carcinoid, neuroendocrine tumor, neuroblastoma, Ewing’s sarcoma, or 
brain tumor that has cells which carry somatostatin receptors.  
 
The purpose of this research study is to see if your tumor can be identified using a special procedure 
called a positron emission tomography (PET) scan  and how the results of this imaging procedure will 
chan ge the management of your tumor . You will have an injection with a radioactive drug called 
68Gallium -DOTA -tyr3-Octreotide (68Ga -DOTATOC) that binds to tumor cells that have somatostatin 
receptors and then have a PET scan. You will then have a "low dose" co mputed tomography (CT) scan 
immediately after the PET scan on the same scanner.  We believe this special PET/CT scan will be able 
to see smaller tumors than the indium [In -111] pent etreotide scan (Octreoscan ™ is the Brand name for 
the scan) that is the cur rent standard of care.   68Ga -DOTATOC is considered investigational, which 
means that it has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  Your physicians will be 
asked to complete a fo rm prior to the scan that summarizes their understanding of the extent of disease 
and the current management of the disease without the information from the PET scan with 68Ga -
DOTATOC. After the scan is completed, they will be asked if and how the scan will impact the

HOW MANY PEOPLE  WILL PARTICIPATE?  
 
Approximately  200 people will take part in this study conducted by investigators at the University of 
Iowa.   
 
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THIS STUDY?  
 
If you agree to take part in this study, your involvement will include at least 2 visits a nd a phone call.  
 
If you r doctor believes your tumor has progressed or if you receive treatment for your tumor after visit 
2, you may have up to 4 visits and 2 phone calls. You will have an additional visit for a second 68Ga -
DOTATOC PET/CT scan which will  include a phone call the following day. This second scan will 
happen only if your doctor believes your tumor has progressed or if you receive treatment for your 
tumor, and a second 68Ga -DOTATOC PET/CT scan is recommended to determine how well your tumor 
responded. Each PET/CT scan will require that you spend approximately 3 hours in the UIHC PET  
Imaging  Center.  The screening visit and follow -up visits will take between 30 minutes and an hour.  
 
Pregnancy Testing for Females Under the Age of 18  
 
All female s who are physically able to become pregnant will be required to have a pregnancy test before 
each PET scan . If the test shows that you are pregnant, you will not be able to continue in the study. This 
testing will occur in a private area without any of your family members with you.  
 
If you are 12 years of age or older we will only tell you the results of the test.  
 
You can decide whether or not to tell your parents or guardian the results of the pregnancy test, 
however, if you are pregnant we will need to tell your parents you cannot continue in the study.  
If the pregnancy test shows that you are pregnant we will ask  you whether or not you want us to talk 
with your parents or guardian about your pregnancy.  
 
If you are under 12 years of age and the pregnancy test shows that you are pregnant, we are required to 
report the pregnancy to the proper authorities.  
  
IMPORTA NT: No matter how old you are - if we think that your pregnancy may have happened 
because of abuse, we will tell the proper authorities and your parents or guardian will be told about your 
pregnancy.

The PET/CT images for this study will be reviewed by a nuclear medicine physician and will be entered 
in your medical record.  
 
The following information will be obtained from your medical record: pathology report indicating 
presence of a tu mor; biomarkers that indicate whether your tumor is growing, including any blood work,  
CT or MRI and an Octreoscan ™ showing this tumor, and what treatments you may have had since your 
last Octreoscan ™ and CT or MRI.  
 
There are no further research procedur es in this study  after you complete the 68Ga -DOTATOC scans 
and follow -up phone call. W e will follow -up your clinical progress from your clinical chart up to 5 years 
after your 68Ga -DOTATOC PET/CT scan. If you do not receive your follow -up care at the Unive rsity, 
we may contact you to ask for the follow -up information. At that time, if you allow us, we may also 
contact your physician to obtain information on your tumor therapy/follow -up.    
 
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THIS STUDY?  
You may experience one or more o f the risks indicated below from being in this study. In addition to 
these, there may be other unknown risks, or risks that we did not anticipate, associated with being in this 
study.  
 
There is a small risk of pain, burning, or infection at the site of the  blood draws for laboratory tests and

  Page 5 of 11 at the site of IV injection  of Ga-68 DOTATOC. If you elect to take alprazolam or lorazepam prior to the 
PET/CT scan, you may experience drowsiness or unclear thinking.  You will not be allowed to drive or 
to operate ma chinery for 12 -24 hrs. after receiving alprazolam or lorazepam.  You will need a driver to 
take you home or to your hotel following either of these two drugs.  Children may require sedation or 
anesthesia to remain still during the PET scanning procedure. Th e risks of sedation include a reaction to 
the medication used for sedation or anesthesia. If anesthesia is required, there is a risk of injury to the 
throat or airways from insertion of  the breathing tube.   
 
Ther e is a financial risk to participating in this study. The FDA has previously allowed us to charge the 
patient or his/her insurance c ompany for the cost of the drug, which is prepared in the UIHC PET 
Center. The charge to the pati ent or her/his insurance co mpany is $ 5,915. The other costs to the patient 
for being in this study include travel and loss of work hours; each subject will be free to decline 
participation based on these financial issues . 
 
There may be some emotional/psychological risk of the PET sc an showing more widespread tumor than 
was previously recognized ; however, there is also the possibility that the scan will show less tumor than 
previously thought.  
 
 Radiation Risk  
The maximum amount of radiati on from the research -related radiation procedures in this study is 
equivalent to approximately 60  % of the annual radiation limit for a medical worker . Long term effects 
on your health such as cancer cannot be ruled out from this amount of radiation.  Thi s dose estimate 
takes into account only the exposure to research procedures in this project.  If you have participated in 
other research studies involving radiation exposure, you should be aware that the risk of effects from 
radiation is believed to increa se with each exposure you receive (including studies performed as part of 
your medical care).   
PET Scan Risk  
The PET/CT scanner is a large machine with a hollow tube that will be used to see how much 68Ga -
DOTATOC is taken into your tumor. You will be asked  to lie on your back on a special table that slides 
into the tube.  The sides of the tube will be fairly close to your body and you will be in this scanner for 
approximately 30 -35 minutes.  We will monitor you closely while you are inside the scanner. You will 
also be given a call button to press if you would need to speak to us during the scan. The risks from the 
PET scan include the radiation described above, pain from lying still on the table or a panic attack if you 
have claustrophobia.  
 
Children may re quire sedation or anesthesia to remain still during the PET scanning procedure.  The 
risks of sedation include a reaction to the medication used for sedation or anesthesia.  If anesthesia is 
required, there is a risk of injury to the throat or airways from  insertion of the breathing tube.  
 
Women Capable of Becoming Pregnant  
If you are a woman who is capable of beco ming pregnant, we will ask you to have a pregnancy test 
before beginning this study.  You must use effective birth control methods and try not to become 
pregnant while participating in this study.  If you become pregnant, there may be unknown risks to your  
fetus, or risks to your fetus that we did not anticipate, associated with being in the study. There may be 
long-term effects of the treatment being studied that could increase the risk of harm to an unborn child.  
If you believe or know you have become pr egnant while participating in this research study, please

  Page 6 of 11 contact Dr. MS O’Dorisio at 319 -356-3595 as soon as possible so that counseling can be provided to 
you.  If a false positive pregnancy test is suspected, an obstetrician will be available to help yo u and the 
study team determine if you are or are capable of becoming pregnant.    
 
Radiation Exposure in Women Capable of Becoming Pregnant  
You may not participate in this study if you are pregnant.  If you are capable of becoming pregnant, we 
will perform  a pregnancy test before exposure to research -related radiation.  You must tell us if you may 
have become pregnant within the previous 14 days because the pregnancy test is unreliable during that 
time.  
 
Radiation Exposure in Women Who are Breast Feeding  
You may not participate in this study if you are breast feeding an infant.  There is a chance that the 
68Ga -DOTATOC could travel to your infant in your breast milk and cause unknown risks to your child.  
 
 
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF THIS STUDY?  
 
We don’ t know if you will benefit from being in this study.   We may be able to see more tumor lesions 
(or less) compared to an Octreoscan ™.  If you receive a second 68Ga -DOTATOC PET/CT scan 12 -36 
months after your first, we may or may not be able to determine how  much response you had to the 
treatment.  
 
However, we hope that, in the future, other people might benefit from this study because of knowledge 
gained in determining whether 68Ga -DOTATOC PET/CT scans are more sensitive than the current 
Octreoscan ™ plus hig h-resolution, contrast -enhanced CT for detecting somatostatin receptor positive 
tumors and measuring response to treatment.  
 
WILL IT COST ME ANYTHING TO BE IN THIS STUDY?  
 
You will have additional costs associated with being in this research study. You wil l be required to pay 
for study procedures that are not part of your re gular care. This includes $5, 915 for the 68Ga -
DOTATOC PET/CT scan and associated costs, and pregnancy testing (if needed). The $5, 915 charge 
includes making the drug, performing the PET/ CT, interpreting the results, and sending a report to your 
doctor.  
 
In some cases, insurance may cover part of the study procedures. It is recommended that you contact 
your insurance provider in advance to determine if payment for the study procedures wil l be covered. In 
the event that your insurance company denies all or part of the study procedures as “non -covered,” you 
will be responsible for the charges.  The University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics has developed a plan for 
helping you obtain insurance co verage.  If necessary, a physician will engage in a peer -to-peer review 
with your insurance company.  This will increase the chances of the costs being covered, but does not 
guarantee coverage.  If the insurance company denies this request, you will be informed of  the cost.  
You may choose to pay or decline to participate in the study.  
 
Medicare cannot be billed for study procedures that are not part of your regular care. If you have 
Medicare, you will be billed for all study procedures not part of your re gular care.

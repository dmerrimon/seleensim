1.0   INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1  Advanced Stage Lung Cancer  
In advanced stage IV NSCLC, meta -analysis of 8 trials using cisplatin based chemotherapy 
compared to Best Supportive Care resulted in chemotherapy having an absolute survival 
improvement of 10% at 1 year. (1, 2) Median survival, BSC vs. chemo: 4 vs 8+ mont hs, 
respectively. (3) Median survival now is 12+ months in more recent trials of VEGF targeted 
therapy plus platinum doublet. (4) Quality of life benefit was also observed with chemotherapy. 
(5)  First-line chemotherapy for unselected stage IV NSCLC is a p latinum doublet as the standard 
platform.  Combining taxanes with other chemotherapeutic agents has been reported to have high 
activity and to be tolerable.  Platinum doublets resulted in 2 year Survival of 15 -20%. (6) Scagliotti 
observed a survival advant age selecting doublet chemotherapy based on tumor histology. Using a 
platinum based doublet, the author observed 2 month longer median overall survival for 
adenocarcinoma treated with pemetrexed and 1 month longer for squamous cell carcinoma treated 
with g emcitabine. (7) Molecular targeted agents added to platinum doublet chemotherapy can also 
improve survival.  Anti -VEGF monoclonal antibody,  Bevacizumab , added  to platinum and 
paclitaxel improved overall survival in adenocarcinoma subset with stage IV disea se. (8) Selection 
of targeted agents where target is known can replace first -line chemotherapy (EGFR -TKIs in 
EGFR mutants; ALK fusion mutants treated with MEK TKIs). (9, 10) Identifying  better 
biomarkers will lead to better targeting.  
 
1.1.2  Ipilimumab an d Advanced Melanoma:  
 
Ipilimumab e nhanced T -cell activation leads to pan immune stimul ation against human solid tumor s. 
Recently reported unresectable stage III or IV melanoma that progressed while they were receiving 
therapy was treated with Ipilimumab dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight . The ipilimumab 
treated cohort was observed to have improved median overall survival 10.0 months compared with 
6.4. ( 30)  
 
1.1.3  Ipilimumab and Advanced Lung Cancer:  
 
In advanced metastatic NSCLC, Ipilimumab 10 mg/ kg has been successfully combined with the 
platin doublet, paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and carboplati n AUC 6, as first -line treatment.  -Abstracts of a  
phase II trial reported that the phased sequence (two courses chemotherapy followed by two courses 
of chemothe rapy + Ipilimumab) had superior progression free survival, overall response, and overall

months, for the concurrent sequence. ( 31, 32) . 
 
 
Final publication by Ly nch observed immune related PFS (irPFS) significantly improved using the 
phased regimen compared with the control regimen (HR, 0.72; P = .05), whereas the concurrent 
ipilimumab regimen did not significantly improve irPFS (HR, 0.81; P = .13). As assessed by  WHO 
criteria, there was also an improvement in PFS, relative to the control, for phased ipilimumab (HR, 
0.69; P = .02) but not for concurrent ipilimumab (HR, 0.88; P = .25). The median mWHO -PFS was 
4.2 months for the control group, 5.1 months for the phas ed ipilimumab group, and 4.1 months for 
the concurrent ipilimumab group. Similarly,  improved median overall survival for the phased 
ipilimumab group was 12.2 months, and increase of 3.9 months over the median of 8.3 months for 
the control group (HR, 0.87;  P = .23). the median overall survival of 9.7 months for the concurrent 
ipilimumab group was similar to that of the control group (HR, 0.99; P = .48).  Hematologic and 
nonhematologic toxicities were similar between control arm [Paclitaxel and Carboplatin] 
compared to phased arm [Ipilimumab, Paclitaxel, Carboplatin]; and toxicities were typical of 
those associated with Paclitaxel and Carboplatin. Specifically, toxicities observed as Grade 1 -2 
occuring > 30% in descending order (control, phased arm): anemia 8 9,92; alopecia 46,45; 
thrombocytopenia 35, 43; neutropenia 32,34; diarrhea 31,31; AST elevation 32,31; ALT 
elevation 35,29.  Observed Grade 3 -4 toxicities were infrequent, interestingly they more frequent  
in the control than phased arm,  less than 9% and 6%, respectively.  (59) 
 
 
1.2  Early Stage Lung Cancer  
 
1.2.1  Early Stage and Surgery  
The natural history of clinically staged (stage I and stage II) non-small  cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
following surgery is a five year survival of 50% and 30%, respectively.(1) Five -year survival in 
surgical pathologic stage IA (T1N0M0) and IB (T2N0M0) disease is 68 -83% and 53 -65%, 
respectively. Five year survival in surgical path ologic stage IIA (T1N1M0) and IIB (T2N1M0) 
disease is 40 -63% and 38 -45%, respectively.(2) Clinical implications are pathologically staged 
patients (17 -32% stage IA, 35 -47% stage IB, 37 -60% stage IIA, and 55 -62% stage IIB) are destined 
to recur because they  harbor regional or distant micro -metastasis outside their surgical resection.  
 
 
1.2.2  Early Stage and Posto perative Chemotherapy  
For early stage NSCLC, t he addition of chemotherapy to surgery has been shown to improve 
survival. Postoperative chemotherapy  improved 5 -year survival from 59% and 40% to 79% and 60% 
for stage IB > 4cm tumors and stage II NSCLC, respectively. ( 11, 12) Three randomized controlled 
trials of postoperative chemotherapy each reported improved overall survival for chemotherapy in

cisplatin based chemotherapy for stage IIIA NSCLC. ( 16)  
 
1.2.3  Early Stage and Preoperative Chemotherapy  
Preoperative chemotherapy trials have included small phase III and phase II trials which initially 
report ed a threefold  median survival advantage favoring chemotherapy. (17) (18) However, 
long-term results were not durable, although a trend of improved sur vival favoring chemotherapy 
persisted. (19) (20) Four additional preoperative chemotherapy phase III trials  have been 
conducted. One reported  significant OS advantage using a non -taxane platin triplet (21), two 
reported trends to OS advantage using paclita xel/carboplatin (22, 23), and one was completely 
negative administered older technology chemotherapy (non -taxane/platin ) to 88% of patients. 
(24)  Most recently, a phase III trial r eported  preoperative chemotherapy using g emcitabine plus 
cisplatin improved  survival in patients with clinical stage IIB/IIIA NSCLC. The hazard ratios for 
PFS and overall survival were both in favor of chemotherapy. A statistically significant impact 
of preoperative chemotherapy on outcomes was observed in the stage IIB/IIIA subg roup (3 -year 
PFS rate: 36.1% v 55.4%; P _ .002). (25) Similar survival benefits have been observed for 
preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy by Meta -analysis. (26, 27, 28, 29)  
 
 
1.3  Proposal: Ipilimumab and Early Stage Lung Cancer  
 
In early stage NSCLC  we propose adding ipilimumab , a T -Cell targeted agent , to enhance T -Cell 
immune response combined with preoperative platinum doublet chemotherapy . Ipilimumab is a 
monoclonal (IgG 1) antibody that co -stimulates T -Cells by targeting the CD28 homolog , CTLA -
4. This enhances T -cell immunity by co -stimulation of T -cells at T -cell receptor and CD28 by B7 
family on the antigen - presenting cell (APC). The combination of enhanced immune response 
together with cytotoxic chemotherapy may improve clinical outcome . We propose to study 
circulating T cells and tumor infiltrating T cells with specificities against tumor associated 
antigens  to better understand the effect that ipilimumab has on the immune system in NSCLC.  
 
1.4  Clinical  Trial Rationale  
 
We propose studying the cell mediated effects of ipilimumab in combination with chemotherapy 
in the neoadjuvant setting for NSCLC.  The overall immune assessment strategy for the proposed 
ipilimumab neoadjuvant trial will be based on the hypothesis that 1)  T cells with specificities 
against tumor associated antigens expressed by the patient’s progressing NSCLC are present, but 
functionally impaired, at baseline, and 2) that the immunomodulatory effects of chemotherapy 
plus ipilimumab will impact the suppres sive mechanisms, restoring functional reactivity to 
important anti -tumor effector cell populations.

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  An important potential biomarker for anti -tumor immune response is the proliferation and 
stimulation of circulating T cells with specificities against t umor associated antigens (TAA). At 
baseline few patients with cancer have populations of circulating T cells with specificities 
against TAA above the detectable level of 0.05% CD8 lymphocytes. The primary endpoint of 
this clinical trial will be to determin e if the addition of ipilimumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
for non -small cell lung cancer increases the percentage of patients with circulating T cells with 
specificities against TAA. We will also measure tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in resected 
tumors.  
 
1.4.1 T Cells with Specificities Against Tumor Associated Antigens  
 
Functional TAA -specific T cell reactivities will be monitored  at 4 time points [1) baseline prior 
to treatment, 2) cycle 2  chemotherapy , prior to ipilimumab  administration , 3) 21-36 days after 
last dose  (cycle 3 ) of chemotherapy prior to  surgery, and 4) 3 -6 weeks after adjuvant ipilimumab 
dose #2 ] utilizing a 1 2-color intracellular cytokine staining (ICS)  assay  in which functional 
reactivities within maturational subsets of CD4  and CD8 T cells will be assessed.  In this assay, 
TAA driven production of IL -2, IFN -γ, TNF -α, and the degranulation marker CD107a will be 
measured, thus permitting examination of qualitative changes in relative T  cell polyfunctionality  
within maturationa l subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes .  Pools of overlapping 15 -mer 
TAA peptides, with 11 amino acid overlaps, will be used for the functional analyses .  The 3 most 
common highly conserved TAA expressed by NSCLC are Survivin,  PRAME , and MAGE -A3, 
but peptide pools for CEA, MAGE -A1, MAGE -A4, MART -1, tyrosinase, NY-ESO -1 and gp100 
are also available in the Core laboratory.  Although the frequencies of TAA -specific T cells may 
be too low in PBMC to permit direct ex vivo functional assessments, tumor specim ens obtained 
at the time of surgical resection, post chemotherapy plus ipilimumab therapy, will be an 
especially rich source of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) for analyses .  
 
 
1.4.2 Longitudinal  Analyses of T Cell and MDSC Phenotypes   
Phenotypic and functional characterization of T cell populations will be performed on peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as well as TIL . It will be of critical  importan ce to better 
understand the impact  of ipilimumab therapy on: 1) regulatory T cel ls (Tregs) , 2) myeloid -
derived suppressor cells  (MDSC) , 3) T cell activation, and 4) T cell exhaustion . These 
parameters will all be assessed using a 14-color polychromatic flow cytometry panel specifically  
designed and validated for this trial.  
 
The comp onents of  both the 1 2-color ICS  and the 1 4-color Treg/Activation/Exhaustion/MDSC 
polychromatic flow cytometry panels are delineated in the Table below.

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  Advances in the understanding of the mechanisms that regulate T cell activation have allowed 
the rational design of new strategies for immunotherapy of tumors, including melanoma. It has 
been known for some time that engagement of the T cell antigen receptor by its elf is not 
sufficient for full T cell activation; a second co -stimulatory signal is required for induction of IL -
2 production, proliferation and differentiation to effector function of naive T cells. Abundant 
data now indicate that the primary source of th is costimulation is mediated by engagement of 
CD28 on the T cell surface by members of the B7 family on the antigen -presenting cell (APC).i 
(33) (Figure 1.)  
Expression of B7 has been shown to be limited to “professional” antigen presenting cells; that is, 
specialized cells of the hematopoietic lineage, including dendritic cells, activated macrophages, 
and activated B cells. It has been suggested that this sharply -defined restriction of B7 expression 
is a fail -safe mechanism for maintenance of peripheral T c ell tolerance, insuring that T cell 
activation can only be stimulated by appropriate APCs.ii (34) The fact that tumor cells do not 
express B7 contributes to their poor capacity to elicit immune responses.  (35, 36)  
The demonstration that induction of express ion of B7 on many tumor cells by transfection, 
transduction, or other mechanisms can heighten tumor immunogenicity led to great interest in 
pursuing this as an approach to tumor immunotherapy. As demonstrated in vivo in murine tumor 
models, the utility of B7 expression as a vaccination approach is limited by the following factors: 
(1) B7 -expressing tumor cell vaccines are only effective when the tumor cells have a high degree 
of inherent immunogenicity; (2) while B7 -expressing vaccines have been shown in ma ny cases 
to be effective in inducing protective immune responses, they have demonstrated only limited 
utility in inducing responses to established tumors; and (3) inactivation of tumor cells by 
radiation has been shown to destroy the immuno -enhancing activ ity of the B7 gene product.  (37, 
38) 
In the past few years it has become apparent that co -stimulation is even more complex than 
originally thought. After activation, T cells express CTLA -4, a close homologue to CD28. 
CTLA -4 binds members of the B7 family w ith a much higher affinity than CD28.  (39) Although 
there was initially some controversy as to the role of CTLA -4 in regulating T cell activation, it 
has become clear that CTLA -4 down -regulates T cell responses. (40)   
This was initially suggested by the following in vitro observations: (1)  blockade of CTLA -4/B7 
interactions with antibody enhanced T cell responses; (2)  cross -linking of CTLA -4 with CD3 and 
CD28 inhibited T cell responses; and (3)  administration of antibodies to CTLA -4 in vivo 
enhanced the i mmune response to peptide antigens or superantigens in mice.  (41, 42, 43, 44) 
Blocking CTLA -4-B7 interaction while preserving signaling via CD28 resulted in enhanced T 
cell responses in vitr o (42).

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  Perhaps the most convincing demonstration of the down -regulatory role of CTLA -4 came from 
examination of mice with a null mutation . (45, 46, 47) C TLA -4 knockout mice appear to have 
spontaneously activated T cells evident at approximately 1 week after birth, followed by rampant 
lymphoproliferation and lymphadenopa thy. These mice die at approximately 3 weeks of age, 
either as a result of polyclonal T cell expansion and tissue destruction or as a result of toxic 
shock resulting from lymphokine production by the T  cells.  Since thymocyte differentiation and 
selection p roceed normally in CTLA -4-deficient mice, the rampant T cell expansion that occurs 
in the mice indicates that CTLA -4 plays a critical role in down -regulating T cell responses in the

1.6.1    Pharmacology of Ipilimumab  
Ipilimumab is a human immunoglobulin G (IgG1)κ anti -CTLA -4 monoclonal antibody (mAb). 
In vitro studies were performed with ipilimumab to demonstrate that it is specific for CTLA -4, 
actively inhibits CTLA -4 interactions with B7.1 and B7.2, does not show any cross -reactivity 
with human B7.1, B7.2 negative cell lines, and stains the appropriate cells without non -specific 
cross -reactivity in normal human tissues, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. 
Ipilimumab does cross -react with CTLA -4 in non -human primates including cynomolgus 
monkeys.  
1.6.2 Animal Toxicology of Ipilimumab  
The effects of ipilimumab on prenatal and postnatal development in monkeys have not been fully 
investigated. Preliminary results are available from an ongoing  study in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Pregnant monkeys received ipilimumab every 21 days from the onset of organogenesis in the 
first trimester through delivery, at dose levels either 2.6 or 7.2 times higher than the clinical dose 
of 3 mg/kg of ipilimumab (by AUC) . No treatment -related adverse effects on reproduction were 
detected during the first two trimesters of pregnancy. Beginning in the third trimester, the 
ipilimumab groups experienced higher incidences of abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery (with 
corre sponding lower birth weight), and higher incidences of infant mortality in a dose -related 
manner compared to controls.  
Genetically engineered mice heterozygous for CTLA -4 (CTLA -4+/-), the target for ipilimumab, 
appeared healthy and gave birth to healthy CT LA-4+/- heterozygous offspring. Mated CTLA -
4+/- heterozygous mice also produced offspring deficient in CTLA -4 (homozygous negative, 
CTLA -4-/-). The CTLA -4-/- homozygous negative offspring appeared healthy at birth, exhibited

age with massive lymphoproliferation and multiorgan tissue destruction.  
Complete information on the pre -clinical toxicology studies can be found in the Ipilimumab 
Investigator Brochure (IB). Non-clinical toxicity assessments included in vitro evaluation for the 
potential of ipilimumab to mediate complement -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (CDCC) or 
antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and toxicology assessments in cynomolgus 
monkeys  alone and in the presence of vaccines.  
The in vitro studies demonstrated that ipilimumab did not mediate CDCC of PHA - or (CD)3 -
activated human T cells. However, low to moderate ADCC activity was n oted at concentrations 
up to 50 ug/mL. These data are consi stent with the requirement of high levels of antigen 
expression on the surface of target cells for efficient ADCC or CDCC. Since ipilimumab is a 
human IgG1, an isotype generally capable of mediating CDCC and ADCC, the lack of these 
activities is likely due  to a very low expression of CTLA -4 on activated T cells. Therefore, these 
data suggest that ipilimumab treatment would not result in depletion of activated T cells in vivo. 
Indeed, no depletion of T cells or T cell subsets were noted in toxicology studies  in cynomolgus 
monkeys.  
No mortality or signs of toxicity were observed in three independent 14 -day intravenous 
toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys at multiple doses up to 30  mg/kg/dose. Furthermore, 
ipilimumab was evaluated in sub -chronic and chronic  toxicology studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys with and without Hepatitis B (HepB) Vaccine and Melanoma Vaccine. Ipilimumab was 
well tolerated alone or in combination in all studies. There were no significant changes in clinical 
signs, body weight values, clini cal pathology values or T cell activation markers. In addition, 
there were no significant histopathology changes in the stomach or colon.  
 
1.7   Clinical Pharmacology  
1.7.1  Mechanism of Action  
CTLA -4 is a negative regulator of T -cell activation. Ipilimumab  binds to CTLA -4 and blocks the 
interaction of CTLA -4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA -4 has been shown to 
augment T -cell activation and proliferation. The mechanism of action of ipilimumab’s effect in 
patients with melanoma is indirect, possi bly through T -cell mediated anti -tumor immune 
responses.

The pharmacokinetics of ipilimumab was studied in 499 patients with unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma who received doses of 0.3, 3, or 10 mg/kg administered once every 3 wee ks for four 
doses. Peak concentration (C max), trough concentration (Cmin), and area under the curve 
(AUC) of ipilimumab were found to be dose proportional within the dose range examined. Upon 
repeated dosing of ipilimumab administered every 3 weeks, ipili mumab clearance was found to 
be time -invariant, and minimal systemic accumulation was observed as evident by an 
accumulation index of 1.5 -fold or less. Ipilimumab steady -state concentration was reached by the 
third dose. The following mean (percent coeffic ient of variation) parameters were generated 
through population pharmacokinetic analysis: terminal half -life of 14.7 days (30.1%); systemic 
clearance (CL) of 15.3 mL/h (38.5%); and volume of distribution at steady -state (Vss) of 7.21 L 
(10.5%). The mean (± SD) ipilimumab Cmin achieved at steady -state with the 3 -mg/kg regimen 
was 21.8 mcg/mL (±11.2).  
Specific Populations:  Cross -study analyses were performed on data from patients with a variety 
of conditions, including 420 patients with melanoma who received s ingle or multiple infusions of 
ipilimumab at doses of 0.3, 3, or 10 mg/kg. The effects of various covariates on ipilimumab 
pharmacokinetics were assessed in population pharmacokinetic analyses.  
Ipilimumab CL increased with increasing body weight; however, no dose adjustment of 
ipilimumab is required for body weight after administration on a mg/kg basis. The following 
factors had no clinically meaningful effect on the CL of ipilimumab: age (range 26 to 86 years), 
gender, concomitant use of budesonide, perfor mance status, HLA -A2*0201 status, positive anti -
ipilimumab antibody status, prior use of systemic anticancer therapy, or baseline lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The effect of race was not examined as there were insufficient 
numbers of patients in non -Caucasian ethnic groups.  
Renal Impairment:  Creatinine clearance at baseline did not have a clinically important effect on 
ipilimumab pharmacokinetics in patients with calculated creatinine clearance values of 29 
mL/min or greater.  
Hepatic Impairment:  Basel ine AST, total bilirubin, and ALT levels did not have a clinically 
important effect on ipilimumab pharmacokinetics in patients with various degrees of hepatic 
impairment.  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles for ipilimumab have been analyzed. The primary objective of 
Protocol MDX010 -015 was to determine the safety and PK profile of single and multiple doses 
of ipilimumab derived from a transfectoma or hybridoma cell line. Mean plasma concentrations 
of ipilimumab administered at doses of 3  mg/kg (hybridoma -derived drug product); 2.8  mg/kg, 
5 mg/kg, 7.5  mg/kg, 10  mg/kg, 15  mg/kg, and 20  mg/kg (transfectoma -derived drug product)

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  demonstrated approximate dose proportionality. Equimolar doses of hybridoma -derived and 
transfectoma -derived drug product had compara ble PK profiles. The range of mean volume of 
distribution at steady state (Vss) across cohorts 2.8, 3, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, and 20  mg/kg, was 57.3 to 
82.6 mL/kg, indicating drug distribution was mostly limited to the intravascular space. The 
clearance was low ( range 0.11 to 0.29  mL/h/kg) and reflective of the half -life (range 297 to 
414 h), which is consistent with the long terminal disposition phase of ipilimumab. There was 
moderate variability in the PK parameters among subjects, with CV of 11% to 48% in AUC  (0-
21d), 20% to 59% in CL, and 17% to 46% in Vss.  
Ipilimumab was originally produced and purified from a hybridoma clone. Ipilimumab drug 
substance is currently manufactured using Process B. A new drug substance manufacturing 
process (Process C) has been de veloped utilizing a higher producing sub -clone of the current 
Master Cell Bank, and modified cell culture and purification steps. The new drug substance 
manufacturing process is intended to replace the current drug substance manufacturing process. 
The bioc omparability of Process C relative to Process B was assessed in Study CA184087.  
 
PK in Phase 1 Study CA184087 (Process B and Process C)  
The PK of ipilimumab was assessed when manufactured by a newer process C relative to current 
process B as an IV infusio n (1.5 -hr), in subjects with advanced melanoma (CA184087). Upon 
meeting eligibility criteria, subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive either ipilimumab Process 
B (Arm A, reference) or ipilimumab Process C (Arm B, test) at a dose of 10 mg/kg IV 
administer ed over 90 minutes every 3 weeks on Days 1, 22, 43, and 64 (Weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10) 
during induction therapy. Randomization was stratified by baseline body weight (BW) and LDH 
values since both were identified as potential covariates in a population PK asse ssment.  
The primary endpoint of PK data at week 4 demonstrated that the PK of Process B and Process C 
are biocomparable as the 90% CIs for the ratio of geometric means of AUC(0 -21d) and Cmax - 
both adjusted or not adjusted for covariates - were entirely co ntained with the pre -specified 
equivalence interval (80 - 125%).  
 
Population Pharmacokinetics  
The population pharmacokinetics (PPK) of ipilimumab was developed with 420 subjects (1767 
serum concentrations) with advanced melanoma in phase 2 studies (CA18400 7, CA184008, and 
CA184022). (50, 51, 52) subsequently , the final PPK model was evaluated by an external model 
validation dataset from CA184004 (79 subjects with 328 serum concentration data). The PPK 
analysis demonstrated that PK of ipilimumab is linear an d exposures are dose proportional across

ipilimumab CL of 15.3 mL/h from PPK analysis is consistent with that determined by PK 
analysis as assessed in MDX010 -15 as 1 2.8 mL/h for a dose of 2.8 mg/kg and 15.7 mL/h for a 
dose of 10 mg/kg. The terminal half -life and Vss of ipilimumab calculated from the model were 
14.7 days, and 7.21 L, which are consistent with that determined by non -compartmental analysis 
(NCA). Volume of central and peripheral compartment were found to be 4.16 and 3.22 L, 
respectively, suggesting that ipilimumab first distributes into plasma volume and subsequently 
into extracellular fluid space. Clearance of ipilimumab was found to increase with increa se in 
body weight, supporting dosing of ipilimumab based on a weight normalized regimen. Other  
covariates had effects that were either not statistically significant or were of minimal clinical 
relevance.  
 
1.8   Clinical Safety with Ipilimumab  
 
1.8.1   Overview of Clinical Trials Experience  
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates 
observed cannot be directly compared with rates in other clinical trials or experience with 
therapeutics in the same class and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.  
The clinical development program excluded patients with active autoimmune disease or those 
receiving systemic immunosuppression for organ transplantation. Exposure to ipilimumab 3 
mg/kg for  four doses given by intravenous infusion in previously treated patients with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma was assessed in a randomized, double -blind clinical study 
(MDX010 -20). One hundred thirty -one patients (median age 57 years, 60% male) receive d 
ipilimumab as a single agent, 380 patients (median age 56 years, 61% male) received ipilimumab 
with an investigational gp100 peptide vaccine (gp100), and 132 patients (median age 57 years, 
54% male) received gp100 peptide vaccine alone. Patients in the s tudy received a median of 4 
doses (range 1 to 4 doses). Ipilimumab was discontinued for adverse reactions in 10% of 
patients.  (48) 
 
The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) in patients who received ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg 
were fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus, ras h, and colitis.

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  CA184024 evaluated the addition of 10 mg/kg ipilimumab to dacarbazine in patients with 
previously untreated, metastatic melanoma.  A total of 502 patients  were randomized to receive 
up to 8 cycles of dacarbazine 850 mg/m2 q3w, with either ipilimumab 10 mg or placebo for 
cycles 1 -4 and as maintenance after completion of chemotherapy.  Ipilimumab AEs were 
consistent with previous studies and predominantly aff ected skin, I tract, liver, and the endocrine 
system.  Events were managed with established guidelines and were generally responsive to dose 
interruption/discontinuation, corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressants.  Select adverse 
events associated wi th the mechanism of action of ipilimumab, regardless of attribution by the

Safety Profile of Ipilimumab at a Dose of 10 mg/kg (Phase 2 data)  
 
The safety profile of ipilimumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg was characterized in a total of 
325 subjects who received multiple doses of 10 mg/kg ipilimumab as monotherapy in the 4 
completed mela noma studies (CA184004, -007, -008, and -022). (49, 50, 51, 52) Overall, the 
incidence of Grade 3/4 AEs attributable to study drug was 31%. The target organ system, the 
incidence and the severity of the most commonly observed irAEs  are displayed in Table  4.

Overall, the 10 mg/kg had an acceptable safety regimen, while being the most active dose. The 
study drug related deaths across the program are in Section 5 of the investigators brochure.  
 
Across clinical studies that utilized ipilimumab doses ranging from 0.3 to 10 mg/kg, the 
following adverse reactions were also reported (incidence less than 1% un less otherwise noted): 
urticaria (2%), large intestinal ulcer, esophagitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, renal 
failure, and infusion reaction.  
 
Based on the experience in the entire clinical program for melanoma, the incidence and severity 
of enter ocolitis and hepatitis appear to be dose dependent.

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  1.8.2   Immunogenicity  
In clinical studies, 1.1% of 1024 evaluable patients tested positive for binding antibodies against 
ipilimumab in an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) based assay. This assay has substantial 
limitations in detecting anti -ipilimumab antibodies in the presence of ipilimumab. Infusion -
related or peri -infusional reactions consistent with hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis were not 
reported in these 11 patients nor were neutralizing antibo dies against ipilimumab detected.  
Because trough levels of ipilimumab interfere with the ECL assay results, a subset analysis was 
performed in the dose cohort with the lowest trough levels. In this analysis, 6.9% of 58 evaluable 
patients, who were treated with 0.3 mg/kg dose, tested positive for binding antibodies against 
ipilimumab.  
Immunogenicity assay results are highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity 
and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collectio n, concomitant 
medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to 
ipilimumab with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading.  
 
1.8.3   Pregnancy Outcomes  
Based on animal data, ipilimumab may cause fetal harm. The use of ipilimumab during human 
pregnancy has not been formally studied in clinical trials. There have been 7 known pregnancies 
during ipilimumab treatment: in 3 female subjects and in the partners of 4 male study subjects. 
Two (2)  of the 3 female pregnancies ended with elected terminations. The third female subject 
had a history of seizures and delivered the baby at 36 weeks gestation. The baby had respiratory 
complications that resolved by birth week 16. Three (3) of the 4 partner s of male study subjects 
had full term, normal babies. The fourth baby had small ureters, which are expected to grow as 
the baby matures. Although these outcomes do not indicate that stillbirths or other severe 
abnormalities will occur, pregnancy should be  avoided during treatment with ipilimumab.  
 
 
1.8.4  Immune -mediated Adverse Reactions with Ipilimumab  
Ipilimumab can result in severe and fatal immune -mediated reactions due to T -cell activation and 
proliferation.

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  Immune -related Gastrointestinal Events  
The clinical presentation of GI immune -related AEs included diarrhea, increase in the frequency 
of bowel movements, abdominal pain, or hematochezia, with or without fever. Fatalities due to 
GI perforation have been reported in clinical trials of ipilimumab.  Patients should be carefully 
monitored for GI symptoms that may be indicative of immune -related colitis, diarrhea, or GI 
perforation. Diarrhea or colitis occurring after initiation of ipilimumab therapy should be 
evaluated to exclude infectious or alterna te etiologies. In clinical trials, immune -related colitis 
was associated with evidence of mucosal inflammation, with or without ulcerations, and 
lymphocytic infiltration.  
Immune -related Hepatotoxicity  
Hepatic immune -related AEs were mostly clinically silen t and manifested as transaminase or 
bilirubin laboratory abnormalities. Fatal hepatic failure has been reported in clinical trials of 
ipilimumab. Serum transaminase and bilirubin levels must be evaluated before each dose of 
ipilimumab as early laboratory c hanges may be indicative of emerging immune -related hepatitis. 
Elevations in liver function tests (LFTs) may develop in the absence of clinical symptoms. 
Increase in LFT or total bilirubin should be evaluated to exclude other causes of hepatic injury, 
including infections, disease progression, or medications, and monitored until resolution. Liver 
biopsies from patients who had immune -related hepatotoxicity showed evidence of acute 
inflammation (neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages).  
Immune -related Skin  Toxicity  
Skin immune -related AEs presented mostly as a rash and/or pruritus. Some subjects reported 
vitiligo associated with ipilimumab administration. Fatal toxic epidermal necrolysis has been 
reported in clinical trials of ipilimumab.  
Immune -related En docrinopathy  
Ipilimumab can cause inflammation of the endocrine system organs, specifically hypophysitis, 
hypopituitarism, and adrenal insufficiency and patients may present with nonspecific symptoms, 
which may resemble other causes such as brain metastasi s or underlying disease. The most 
common clinical presentation includes headache and fatigue. Symptoms may also include visual 
field defects, behavioral changes, electrolyte disturbances, and hypotension. Adrenal crisis as a 
cause of the patient’s symptoms  should be excluded. Based on the available data with known 
outcome, most of the subjects symptomatically improved with hormone replacement therapy. It 
is possible that long -term hormone replacement therapy will be required for subjects developing 
hypophys itis/hypopituitarism after treatment with ipilimumab.

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  Immune -related Neurological Events  
Neurological manifestations included muscle weakness and sensory neuropathy. Fatal Guillain -
Barré syndrome has been reported in clinical trials of ipilimumab. Patient s may present with 
muscle weakness. Sensory neuropathy may also occur. Unexplained motor neuropathy, muscle 
weakness, or sensory neuropathy lasting more than 4 days should be evaluated and non -
inflammatory causes such as disease progression, infections, me tabolic syndromes, and 
medications should be excluded.  
Other Immune -related AEs  
Ocular inflammation, manifested as Grade 2 or Grade 3 episcleritis or uveitis, was associated 
with concomitant diarrhea in a few subjects (< 1%) and occasionally occurred in th e absence of 
clinically apparent GI symptoms. Other presumed immune -related AEs reported include, but 
were not limited to, arthritis/arthralgias, pneumonitis, pancreatitis, autoimmune (aseptic) 
meningitis, autoimmune nephritis, pure red cell aplasia, nonin fective myocarditis, polymyositis, 
and myasthenia gravis, of which were individually reported for < 1% of subjects.  
Overall, immune -related AEs commonly started within 3 to 10 weeks from first dose, were 
successfully managed in most instances by omitting doses, discontinuing dosing, and/or through 
administering symptomatic or immunosuppressive therapy, including corticosteroids, as 
mentioned  above and detailed in Section 11 . Immune -related AEs generally resolved within days 
to weeks in the majority of subj ects.  
 
1. 85    Ipilimumab and Growth Factor Support  
Phase I data observed it was safe to combine ipilimumab with the hematopoietic growth factor, 
granulocyte macrophage colony -stimulating factor (GM -CSF), sargramostim. Ipilimumab was 
escalated from 0.5 to 3 mg/kg q 4 weeks with GM -CSF subcutaneous at fixed dose 250mcg/m2 
for 14 days each cycle. Ipilimumab was successfully escalated to 3 mg/kg where 2/6 grade 3 
irAEs were observed: 1 pan -hypopituitarism, 1 diarrhea. Both irAEs were easily treated. 1 grade  
3 temporal arteritis was also observed unknown if related to ipilimumab? Interestingly, immune 
induced antitumor T cells were observed at highest dose and tumor response >50% drop in PSA 
was observed only in patiens with grade 3 irAEs. (58) 
 
1.9   Clinical  Efficacy: Melanoma Program  
The clinical efficacy of ipilimumab as a single agent at a dose of 3 mg/kg administered every 3 
weeks for 4 doses has been established in MDX010 -20 (a randomized, controlled study in 
second line, locally advanced/metastatic mela noma), which led to approval of ipilimumab by the

of 10 mg/kg ipilimumab to dacarbazine led to a prolongation of overall survival in patients with  
previously untr eated melanoma and was feasible with an acceptable safety profile.  
Overall survival and other efficacy endpoints were assessed in ipilimumab studies.  
Overall Survival: Prolongs survival in patients with metastatic melanoma who have failed prior 
treatment.  
Best Objective Response Rate (BORR): By the conventional mWHO criteria confirmed 
objective responses have been observed in subjects receiving ipilimumab. These responses tend 
to be durable with the majority of subjects who achieve objective responses progr ession -free at 
the end of long observation periods.  
Disease Control Rate (DCR): Disease stabilization in subjects receiving ipilimumab is a key 
characteristic of anti -tumor activity. Stable disease, sometimes of long duration, or slow steady 
decline of tum or lesion size over long periods of time, has been observed. Consequently, SD as 
well as objective responses (both captured in DCR) are important for completely characterizing 
anti-tumor activity of ipilimumab  
Progression -Free Survival (PFS): Some subjects  demonstrate initial tumor volume increase 
before response, possibly due to T -cell infiltration as shown by biopsies. Consequently, PFS 
incompletely captures all patterns of activity and may underestimate the clinical activity of 
ipilimumab.  
 
1.9.1    Ratio nale for Using Immune -Related Tumor Assessment   
Ipilimumab is an immuno -stimulating antibody with evidence of anti -cancer activity (durable 
objective response and stable disease) in subjects with advanced melanoma, including subjects 
with established brai n disease. Observations of clinical activity defined by tumor response 
endpoints defined by conventional criteria (eg, mWHO) may be inadequate to realize the kinetics 
and magnitude of clinical benefit achieved with ipilimumab.  
Histopathologic evidence has demonstrated ipilimumab can produce an influx or expansion of 
tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Therefore, early increases in lesion size detected radiologically 
or upon gross examination could be misinterpreted as progressive tumor growth and precede 
object ive tumor shrinkage. In addition the appearance of new lesions may have categorized a 
subject to have progressive disease using conventional tumor assessment criteria despite the 
concurrent observation of objective tumor responses in pre -existing lesions a nd a net reduction in 
global tumor burden that includes the new lesions.

not be presumed to have progressed and will proceed to surgery as long as all possible  sites of 
disease are deemed resectable by the surgeon.  
 
1.9.2    MDX010 -20 (Phase 3, 3 mg/kg, previously treated melanoma)  
MDX010 -20, a randomized (3:1:1), double -blind, double -dummy study included 
676 randomized subjects with unresectable or metastatic me lanoma previously treated with one 
or more of the following: aldesleukin, dacarbazine, temozolomide, fotemustine, or carboplatin. 
Of these 676 subjects, 403 were randomized to receive ipilimumab at 3  mg/kg in combination 
with an investigational peptide vac cine with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (gp100), 137 were 
randomized to receive ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg, and 136 were randomized to receive gp100 alone. 
The study enrolled only subjects with HLA A2*0201 genotype; this HLA genotype facilitates 
the immune prese ntation of the investigational peptide vaccine. The study excluded subjects with 
active autoimmune disease or those receiving systemic immunosuppression for organ 
transplantation. Ipilimumab/placebo was administered at 3 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion 
every 3 weeks for 4 doses. Gp100/placebo was administered at a dose of 2 mg peptide by deep 
subcutaneous injection every 3 weeks for four doses. Assessment of tumor response was 
conducted at Weeks 12 and 24, and every 3 months thereafter. Subjects with evide nce of 
objective tumor response at 12 or 24 weeks had assessment for confirmation of durability of 
response at 16 or 28 weeks, respectively. (48) 
The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS) in the ipilimumab  + gp100 arm 
compared to that in the gp100 arm. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were OS in the 
ipilimumab + gp100 arm compared to the ipilimumab arm, OS in the ipilimumab arm compared 
to the gp100 arm, best overall response rate (BORR) at Week 24 between each of the study arms, 
and du ration of response.  
Of the randomized subjects, 61%, 59%, and 54% in the ipilimumab + gp100, ipilimumab, and 
gp100 arms, respectively, were men. Twenty -nine (29%) percent were  65 years of age, the 
median age was 57 years, 71% had M1c stage, 12% had a hi story of previously treated brain 
metastasis, 98% had ECOG performance status of 0 and 1, 23% had received aldesleukin and

1.9.4    10 mg/kg Dosing with Ipilimumab  
In melanoma, Phase 3 studies show improved survival at both 3 mg/kg (study MDX010 -20) as 
well as with 10 mg/kg (study CA184024). Several additional conducted trials studied the 
efficacy and safety of 10 mg/kg dosing, and additional information gained from these trials is 
listed below:  
 A dose of 10 mg/kg is necessary to ensure a blockade of the CTLA -4 pathway : in vitro  a 
concentration of 20 g/mL of ipilimumab was the minimal concentration able to fully 
abrogate the binding of CTLA -4 to B7.1 and B7.2. With a dose of 3 mg/kg q3w 30% 
achieved a trough concentration of ipilimumab greater than 20 g/mL, compared to 95% of 
subjects treated at 10 mg /kg q3w.  
 In addition, in all ipilimumab trials examined to date, mean Absolute Lymphocyte Count  
(ALC) increased after ipilimumab treatment throughout the 12 -week induction -dosing 
period, in a dose -dependent manner. In an analysis of ipilimumab at 0.3, 3, o r 10 mg/kg in 
melanoma studies CA184007, CA184008, and CA184022 combined, the rate of change in 
ALC after ipilimumab treatment was significantly associated with dose (p = 0.0003), with the 
largest rate at 10 mg/kg ipilimumab. Moreover, the rate of change i n ALC over the first half 
of the induction -dosing period was significantly associated with clinical activity  in these 
studies (p = 0.009), where clinical activity was defined as CR, PR, or prolonged SD (ie, SD 
lasting at least 6  months from first dose). Al though these analyses alone could not determine 
whether the rate of change in ALC was specifically associated with clinical activity in 
response to ipilimumab treatment, as opposed to being generally prognostic, these results do 
suggest a potential benefit  to higher rates of ALC increase after ipilimumab treatment.  
 
 
In the three pri mary studies conducted in advanced melanoma (CA184007, CA184008, and 
CA184022), subjects treated with 10 mg/kg during the induction period had the highest response, 
disease control rates, median OS as well as 1 -year and 2 -year survival rates compared to ot her

2.0   Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Ipilimumab is the first drug to demonstrate  prolonged survival in subjects with pre -treated 
advanced melanoma, based on a large, multinational, double -blind, pivotal, Phase  3 study 
supported by a comprehensive Phase 2 program.  
The unique immune -based mechanism of action is reflected in the clinica l patterns of anti -cancer 
activity in some patients. Ipilimumab impacts tumor cells indirectly, and measurable clinical 
effects emerge after the immunological effects. Tumor infiltration with lymphocytes and the 
associated inflammation (documented by biops y in some subjects) is likely the cornerstone of the 
effect of ipilimumab and can manifest in various patterns of clinical activity leading to tumor 
control. In some cases, inflammation may not be noted by radiological examination and 
objective response is  observed with the first tumor assessment in a manner seen in patients 
receiving other types of anti -cancer treatments. In other cases, response may be preceded by an 
apparent increase in initial tumor volume and/or the appearance of new lesions, which may  be 
mistaken for tumor progression on radiological evaluations. Therefore, in subjects who are not 
experiencing rapid clinical deterioration, confirmation of progression is recommended, at the

initiating potentially toxic alternative therapies in subjects who might be benefitting from 
treatment. Immune -related (ir) response criteria were developed based on these observations to 
systematically categorize novel pat terns of clinical activity and are currently being prospectively 
evaluated in clinical studies.  
In metastatic diseases, stabilization is more common than response, and in some instances is 
associated with slow, steady decline in tumor burden over many mont hs, sometimes improving 
to partial and/or complete responses. Thus, the immune -based mechanism of action of 
ipilimumab results in durable disease control, sometimes with novel patterns of response, which 
contribute to its improvement in OS.  
The immune -based mechanism of action is also reflected in the safety profile. The most common 
drug-related AEs are immune -mediated, consistent with the mechanism of action of the drug and 
generally medically manageable with topical and/or systemic immunosuppressants. As 
previously discussed, the immune -mediated adverse reactions primarily involve the GI tract, 
skin, liver, endocrine glands, and nervous system.  
The early diagnosis of immune -mediated adverse reactions is important to initiate therapy and 
minimize complicati ons. Immune -mediated adverse reactions are generally manageable using 
symptomatic or immunosuppressive therapy as recommended through detailed diagnosis and 
management guidelines, as described fully in the current IB. The management guidelines for 
general immune -mediated adverse reactions and ipilimumab -related GI toxicities, hepatotoxicity, 
endocrinopathy, and neuropathy are provided in the appendices of the current IB.  
In summary, ipilimumab offers clinically meaningful and statistically significant surv ival benefit 
to patients with pre -treated advanced melanoma and evidence of clinical activity in randomized 
studies in other tumor types. These findings, together with evidence of a safety profile that is 
manageable with careful monitoring and appropriate intervention for treatment of immune -
mediated toxicities, suggest an acceptable benefit to risk ratio. In this trial, ipilimumab has the 
potential to have additive therapeutic benefit with standard NSCLC chemotherapy by enhancing 
anti-tumor immune activity . The overall risk -benefit ratio for patients entering this protocol is 
therefore at least comparable to and possibly better than alternative options.

subjects  after neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus ipilimumab.  
 
3.2 Secondary O bjectives : 
1. Evaluate feasibility/ tolerability of neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and 
surgery in early stage NSCLC.  
2. Evaluate disease -free survival  and patterns of metastases after neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
plus ipilimumab in early stage NSCLC.  
3. Evaluate the relationship between pathologic response and the RECIST response  after 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and ipilimumab.  
 
3.3 Exploratory Objectives : (refer to Appendix B for further detail ) 
1. Determine  the percentage of patients with detectable tumor infiltrating lymphocytes 
(TILs) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus ipilimumab.  
2. Estimate the rate of pathologic response rate for neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus 
ipilimumab in early stage NSCLC.  
3. Estimate the objective response rate of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and ipilimumab in 
early stage NSCLC.  
4. Determine if the immunomodulatory effects of neoadujvant chemotherapy plus 
ipilimumab impact the suppressive mechanisms, restoring functional reactivity to 
important anti -tumor effector cell populations.  
5. Explore an alternative definition for detectability suitable for expression values  and 
determining the percentage of patients with circulating T cells meeting this definition.  
6. Evaluate whether presence, qu antity or quality of detectable TILs is associated with

10.0   SAMPLE PROCUREMENT AND HANDLING  
 
10.1 Blood Specimens  
 
Blood will be collected 4 times to assess activated CD8+ T cells with specificity against tumor antigens  and 
CD4 and CD8 functional memory . At each blood collection, 4 tubes of 8.5-ml each will be collected. The 
tubes used will be ACD a nti-coagulated Vacutainer (yellow tops). The following time points will have 
blood collections  (see appendix F): 
 
Collection 1: Baseline prior to treatment  
Collection 2: Cycle 2 day 1 chemo therapy  prior to ipilimumab administration   
Collection 3: 21-36 days after completion of cycle 3 chemotherapy prior to surgery  
Collection 4: 3-6 weeks after adjuvant ipilimimab dose #2.  
 
 
 
10.2 Surgical Specimens  
 
Patients will be approached to participate in the “DUHS Biospecimen Repository and Processing Core 
(BRPC)” eIRB 35974 protocol prior to surgery.  Tissue will be collected and released as described in this 
protocol to ensure proper involvement of pathology to minimize the chance that a tissue collection event 
interferes with appropriate clinical tissue p rocessing and diagnosis.  
 
Tumor specimen  samples will be collected at time of definitive surgical resection of tumor. Lung tissue is 
harvested in the frozen section or gross dissection area of the surgical pathology suite.  The  tissue is first 
examined by a certified anatomic pathologist or surrogate (resident, pathology assistant). Relevant margins 
are inked, removed and examined by frozen section analysis, if necessary. It is imperative that harvesting 
tissue for use in researc h trials does not impede accurate initial assessment of critical features of the tumor 
resection, most notably margin status.  After the specimen has been processed for margin status, the frozen 
section assessment of the specimen is complete, (appendix G), a specimen of excess tumor will be released 
and acquired by the tumor immunology correlative science staff for isolation of tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes  for purposes of this protocol .

baseline.  
 
11.2. Materials and Supplies  
 
Qualified personnel who are familiar with procedures that minimize undue exposure to themselves and 
to the environment should undertake the preparation, handling and safe disposal of chemotherapeutic 
agents in a self -contained, protective environment. Unused portion s of injectable chemotherapeutic 
agents that do not contain a bacteriostatic agent or are prepared with unpreserved diluents (i.e., Sterile 
Water of Injection USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection) should be discarded within eight hours 
of vial entry t o minimize the risk of bacterial contamination . 
 
11.2.1. Paclitaxel, Carboplatin,  Cisplatin  and Ipilimumab  
 
Paclitaxel, carboplatin, and /or cisplatin and ipilimumab will be intravenously administered only at the 
investigational site. As a result, patient compliance is ensured.  
 
 
11.2.2. Paclitaxel  
 
Paclitaxel is commercially available as a sterile solution concentrate, 6 mg/ml in 5 ml vials (30 mg/vial) 
in poluxyethylated castor oil (Cremophor EL) 50% and dehydrated alcohol, USP, 50%. Paclitaxel must 
be pr epared in glass or polyolefin containers due to leaching of diethylexlphthalate (DEHP) plasticizer 
from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags and intravenous tubing by the Cremophor vehicle in which 
paclitaxel is solubilized. Each bag/bottle should be prepared imm ediately before administration. 
Formulation of a small number of fibers in collation (within acceptable limits established by the USP 
Particulate Matter Test for LVP's) has been observed after preparation of paclitaxel.  Therefore, in line 
filtration is ne cessary for administration of paclitaxel solution. In line filtration should be accomplished 
by incorporating a hydrophilic, microporous filter of pore size not greater than 0.22 microns (e.g., 
IVEX -II or IVEX -HP or equivalent) into the IV fluid pathway di stal to the infusion pump.  Although 
particulate formulation does not indicate loss of drug potency, solutions exhibiting excessive particulate 
matter formation should not be used. The intact vials should be stored under refrigeration (2 -8 °C). All 
solutio ns of paclitaxel exhibit a slight haziness directly proportional to the concentration of drug and the 
time elapsed after preparation, although when prepared as  described above, solutions of Paclitaxel 
(0.3-1.2 mg/ml) are physically and chemically stable f or 24 hours. Drug will be diluted in order to 
administer an IV rate of 167 ml per hour for 3 hours. Paclitaxel will be administered via an infusion 
control device (pump) using non -PVC tubing and connectors, such as the IV administration sets 
(polyethylene or polyolefin) which are used to infuse parenteral Nitroglycerin. Nothing else is to be 
infused through the line where paclitaxel is being administered. Patients will be attended by medical

one hour, then every four hours.  Medications for  acute management of anaphylaxis should be readily 
available in the location where the patient is being treated.  
 
 
11.2.3. Cisplatin  
 
Cisplatin (cis -Diamminedichlorop latinum; cis -DDP) is commercially available. It is available as 1 
mg/ml concentration aqueous injection in multidose vials of 50 ml. It should be stored at room 
temperature (15 C to 25C) and protected from light. Solutions diluted in 0.9% or 0.45% NaCl to  a 
concentration of 0.05 -2 mg/ml are stable for up to 72 hours at room temperature and should be protected 
from light. Since no antibacterial preservatives are contained in the formulation, it is recommended that 
any cisplatin solutions admixed for infusio n be discarded after 8 hours from the time of dilution. 
Cisplatin will be administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes. It should be administered in 
250-1000 ml NaCl, following intravenous hydration with at least 1000 ml NaCl. Needles, syringes,  
catheters or IV administration sets containing aluminum parts should not be used as contact with 
cisplatin yields a black precipitate.  
 
11.2.4. Carboplatin  
Carboplatin is supplied commercially as a sterile lyophilized powder available in single -dose vials   
contain ing 50 mg, 50 mg and 450 mg of c arboplatin.  Each vial con tains equal parts by weight of 
carboplatin and m annitol. Preparation:  Immediately before use, the content of each vial must be 
reconstituted with either Sterile Water for injection, USP, 5% dextrose in water, or 0.9% Sodium 
Chlorid e injection, USP, to produce a c arboplatin concentration of 10 mg/ml.  When prepared as 
directed, Carboplatin solutions are stable for 8 hours at room temperature.  Since no antibacterial 
preservative is containe d in the formulation, it is recommended that c arboplatin solutions be discarded 8 
hours after diluti on. Note: aluminum reacts with c arboplatin causing precipitate formation and loss of 
potency; therefore, needles or intravenous sets containing aluminum par ts that may come in contact with 
the drug must not be used for the pr eparation or administration of c arboplatin. Storage and  Stability:  
Unopened vials of c arboplatin are stable for the life indicated on the package when stored at controlled 
room temperatu re and protected from light. Administration:  Administer over 30-60 minutes after 
completing the p aclitaxel infusion.  The Crockcroft Gault formula  (Dose=AUC (CCC+25) will be used 
to achieve the desired AUC where CCC=Wt Kg x (140 -age)/72xCr (using actual body weight for both 
female and male and if female use 85%).  Capped AUC  6 dose of 900 mg.  Appendix D.

11.2.5   Ipilimumab (see section 15.0 for detailed drug information ) 
Ipilimumab is available in concentrations of 5  mg/mL (50  mg/10  mL and 200  mg/40  mL). Ipilimumab 
injection must not be administer ed as an IV push or bolus injection. The total dose must be calculated 
using the most recent subject weight (obtained within thr ee days of the dosing visit prior to the infusion).  
Dose only to change if there is a weight change >10% from baseline.  
For cycles 2 -3 neoadjuvant chemotherapy, Ipilimumab will be administered over 90 minutes followed 
by paclitaxel then cisplatin or carbop latin.  Ipili mumab will be administered as a single agent after 
surgery.  
 
 
11.3 Rationale for Selection of Doses in the Study  
 
11.3.1   Paclitaxel and Cisplatin or Carboplatin and Ipilimumab  
 
The combination of ipilimumab 10 mg/kg, cisplatin 75 mg/m2 or carboplatin AUC  6 and paclitaxel 175 
mg/m2 was found to be safe and effective.  In advanced metastatic NSCLC, Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg has 
been successfully combined with the chemotherapy  doublet, paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 
6, as first -line treatment.  A recent phase II trial reported that the phased sequence (two courses 
chemotherapy followed by two courses of chemotherapy + Ipilimumab) had superior progression free 
survival , overall response, and overall survival; 6.4 months, 57%, and 12.9 months, respectively; 
compared to 5.7 months, 49%, and 9.1 months, for the concurrent sequence. (31, 32)  Overall safety was 
similar to the control arm with grade ¾ adverse events being 57% , 54% and 40% in the three study 
arms, (concurrent ipi limumab+Paclitaxel/carboplatin,  phased ipilimumab+Paclitaxel/carboplatin, and 
paclitaxel/carboplatin alone),  respectively. Hematologic abnormalities observed were those generally 
expected with paclitaxe l/carboplatin alone. Most common (> 5% in any arm) treatment related grade ¾ 
adverse events (concurrent vs phased vs Paclitaxel/carboplatin alone) were: fatigue (10% vs 7% vs 6%) 
and diarrhea (10% vs 7% vs 4%) among nonsquamous patients; nausea (0% vs 5% v s 7%), vomiting 
(0% vs 5% vs 7%) and dyspnea  (0% vs 0% vs 7%) among squamous patients.  (31)Lynch et al, abstr 
701, 14th World Conf on Lung Cancer, July, 2011; (32)Grossi et al, abstr M004, 14th World Conf on 
Lung Cancer, July, 2011).  
 
  
11.4. Selection and Timing of Doses  
Patients in this study will receive chemotherapy on a 21 -day cycle for paclitaxel, plus cisplatin or 
carboplatin. Chemotherapy alone will be given durin g cycle 1 of neoadjuvant therapy  and ipilimumab 
will be given with neoadjuvant chemotherapy during cycles 2 and 3. A cycle of ipilimumab, paclitaxel,

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  and cisplatin and or carboplatin comprises one treatment of each agent on day 1 at least 21 days between 
day 1 dosing. A delay of cycle as  a result of holidays, weekends, bad weather, or other unforeseen 
circumstances will be permitted and not counted as a protocol violation. The actual dose of ipilimumab 
will be determined by the patients ’ weight in kilograms. The actual dose of paclitaxel , or cisplatin, to be 
administered will be determined by calculating the body surface area at the beginning of each cycle, on 
day 1. Carboplatin dose will be determined using the Crockcroft Gault Formula (Dose=AUC (CCC+25) 
will be used to achieve the desir ed AUC where CCC=Wt (140 -age)/72 xCr (using actual body weight for 
both female and male and if female use 85%). A 1.5% variance in the calculated total dose will be 
allowed for ease of dose administration  (Appendix D) .   Institutional guidelines will be uti lized for 
capping the carboplatin dose.  CrCl cap will be 125ml/min using the (AUC 6 capped dose =  900mg) .  
Ipilimumab will be administered first in sequence , followed by paclitaxel, followed by cisplatin or 
carboplatin. Always give ipilimumab 30-60 minutes  before preme ds for paclitaxel.  Cisplatin or 
carboplatin will be given following administration of paclitaxel on the day of therapy. A to tal of 3 cycles 
of chemotherapy  will be given , and ipilimumab will be given during cycles 2 and 3 . 
Ipilimumab w ill be administered alone beginning 4 -10 weeks after surgery to consist of adjuvant therapy 
every 3 weeks for 2 cycles followed by maintenance therapy every 12 weeks  for two cycles    Patients 
receiving post -operative radiation for standard clinical criteri a such as N2 metastatic disease or surgical 
margin sub -optimal, should receive radiation prior to adjuvant ipilimumab or at least 2 weeks after the 
most recent dose of ipilimumab.  
 
11.4.1. Special Treatment Considerations: Dose Adjustments or Delays for Chemotherapy   
Subsequent Cycles . (See section 11.5 -Ipilimumab  Dose Modifications )   
 
Ipilimumab dosing will be concurrent  with paclitaxel/ carboplatin/cisplatin  dosing. Therefore, if 
paclitaxel/platin is delayed due to AEs, ipilimumab will be delayed.  
 
If ipilimumab is delayed due to AEs, paclitaxel/platin will be delayed  up to two weeks . If ipilimumab is 
delayed more than two weeks due to ipilimumab related AE, then ipilimumab will be discontinued from 
cycle 3 of chemotherapy  (and will not be made up)  and c hemotherapy should be given as otherwise 
appropriate. If ipilimumab is held from cycle three of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, ipilimumab may be 
given adjuvantly as per protocol, if ipilimumab AE has resolved and all other criteria for giving 
ipilimumab as per protocol are met.

disclosure is required to initiate the study, to conduct study related activities, or t o comply with national, state or local laws and regulations. 
Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  Any patient who requires a dose reduction of paclitaxel/platin will continue to receive a reduced dose for 
the remainder of the study. No dose escalations are permitted in this study.  
 
Paclitaxel/platin t reatment may be delayed for up to 21days. Patients on a 21 -day cycle regimen may 
have treatment delayed for up to 42 days from Day 1 of the current cycle to allow sufficient time to 
recover from study therapy -related toxicity. A patient who cannot be administered neoadjuvant study 
therapy within 42 days of scheduled day 1 of a cycle will stop neoadjuvant study therapy  and proceed to 
surgery as deemed appropriate by the surgical team so there is no excessive delay in surgery.  If there 
was no grade ≥3 toxicity from ipilimumab, the patient may still receive adjuvant ipilimumab . 
 
 
Chemotherapy dose modifications are allowed as per institutional standard practice for treatment - 
related toxicity.  Listed below are guidelines for chemotherapy modifications.  
 
 
11.4.1.1. Hematologic To xicity Dose A djustments  
 
ANC/AGC must be ≥1500/L and platelets ≥100,000/L prior to the 1st cycle. Dose adjustments at the start 
of a subsequent cycle of therapy will be based on platelet and neutrophil counts on the day of 
scheduled treatment . Treatment sh ould be delayed to allow sufficient time for recovery. Upon 
recovery, if treatment is resumed, it should be according to the guidelines in Table 10 and Table 11. 
 
Table 10  Chemotherapy dose Adjustments Based on Day 1 Hematologic Values  
ANC/AGC (µ L)  Platelets (µ L) Percent of Previous Dose  
≥1500  AND  ≥100,000  100%  
<1500  OR <100,000  Repeat counts weekly, when ANC/AGC 
≥1500 and platelets ≥100,000, retreat at 
100% previous dose. Remove from the 
study if delay >21 days.  
Febrile Neutropenia 
as defined by CTC    Delay treatment as appropriate, once fully 
recovered (<21 days). Retreat at 75% of 
previous dose.  
ANY  AND  <10,000  Delay until recovered, as above, then 
retreat at 75% of previous dose. Remove 
from study if delay >21 days.  
For hemoglobin <8g/dL, transfusion should be considered without interruption of chemotherapy, 
erythropoietin may be used.  
Growth factor support (G -CSF or pegylated G -CSF) may be used at the discretion of the treating 
physician.

For non -hematologic toxicities, ≥  Grade 3  (CTCAE), treatment must be delayed until resolution to 
≤CTCAE grade 1 (or patient’s original baseline grade) before proceeding. Treatment should resume at 
75% of the previous dose level of all chemothe rapy agents if deemed appropriate by the treating 
physician.  
 
11.4.1.3    Renal Toxicity : Cisplatin and Paclitaxel   
 
Renal Toxicity Cisplatin  
Cisplatin therapy should be delayed if the creatinine is > 2.0 mg/dL. If treatment is delayed for renal 
toxicity, re -evaluate the serum creatinine weekly. If the serum creatinine is ≤2.0 mg/dL proceed with 
cisplatin at 75% of previous dose. If serum creatinine is not ≤2.0 mg/dL after 14 days, start next cycle 
without cisplatin. Missed cisplatin doses will not be made up. If creatinine is still not ≤2.0 mg/dL after a 
total of 42 days, the patient must be discontinued from study therapy unless continuation is approved by 
the principal investigator. If creatinine is > 2.0 mg/dL but creatinine clearance is > 45 mL/min, may 
switch fro m cisplatin to carboplatin and continue treatment if all other criteria for therapy are met.  
 
Renal Toxicity  Paclitaxel  
 
No dose adjustments needed  for renal toxicity.  
 
 
11.4.1.4   Neurologic Toxicity: Paclitaxel, Cisplatin or Carboplatin  
Dose of cisplatin, carboplatin and paclitaxel should be reduced for neurologic toxicity (Table 11).  
 
Table 11

Cisplatin is well known to cause high -frequency hearing loss. Continued use of the drug does not always 
result in hearing loss, although it may. If grade 2 or worse hearing loss is noted, the patient should be 
presented with a discussion of th e relative risks of hearing loss versus the potential benefit of continuing 
cisplatin therapy, and a decision made as to continuation of agent. Grade 3 or 4 hearing loss will warrant 
discontinuation of agent.  
 
 
11.4.1.6   Hepatic Toxicity (Paclitaxel)

>5x ULN  and >5x ULN  Or   >NL  Hold*  
Repeat LFTs weekly. If recovered, reduce dose by 25%. If not recovered within 3 weeks, discontinue 
protocol therapy. If paclitaxel is withheld due to hepatic toxicity on day 1, cisplatin or carboplatin 
should also be withheld and administered when paclitax el is resumed. There are no dose reductions of 
cisplatin or carboplatin for hepatic toxicity unless > grade 3.  
 
 
11.4.1.7   Hypersensitivity Reactions to Paclitaxel   
 
For grade 3 reactions, in the subsequent cycle, use double dose steroids pretreatment and  decrease the 
paclitaxel infusion rate for the first 1/3 of the infusion. For the last 2/3 of the infusion, double the rate of 
the infusion. For documented Grade 4 hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel, discontinue paclitaxel.  
 
 
11.4.1.8   Other Toxicit ies from Paclitaxel  
 
If a patient develops chest pain, hypotension, or arrhythmia other than asymptomatic sinus brachycardia, 
the paclitaxel infusion should be stopped and patients should not receive further paclitaxel. For 
asymptomatic sinus brachycardia,  the infusion need not be stopped, but the patie nt should be followed 
carefully.

Ipilimumab Dose Skipping Rule   
Decisions to skip an ipilimumab dose must be made on specified safety criteria. Treatment with 
ipilimumab will be skipped or discontinued if the subject experiences at least one adverse event, 
specified below, considered by the investigator to be “possibly ,” probably,” or “certainly” related to 
ipilimumab treatment. The investigator should contact BMS for any adverse event that will prompt a 
skipped dose or discontinuation of ipilimumab. If the adverse event is associated with ipilimumab 
during preoperative  chemotherapy cycle 2  delay up to 2 weeks, then give cycle 3 chemotherapy alone 
and proceed to surgery as clinically indicated. In the postoperative adjuvant or maintenance ipilimumab 
therapy, delay ipilimumab up to 4 weeks for ipilimumab related toxicity and if not recovered to < grade 
1, discontinue ipilimumab.  
 
The following criteria will be used to determine dose skipping, restarting doses, or discontinuing 
ipilimumab.  
It may be necessary to skip study drug dosing for the following related adverse event (s): 
 
 Any ≥ Grade 2 non -skin related adverse event  (including immune -mediated adverse reactions), 
except for laboratory abnormalities  
 Any ≥ Grade 3 laboratory  abnormality  
 Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness that, in the judgme nt of the 
investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subject with continued dosing.  
 
It is necessary to skip study drug dosing for the following adverse events:  
 Any ≥ Grade 3 skin related adverse event  regardless of causality.

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016   
Restart ipilimumab dosing if/when the adverse event(s) resolve(s) to ≤  Grade  1 severity or returns 
to baseline:  
 If the adverse event is associated with ipilimumab during preoperative chemotherapy cycle 2, 
delay up to 2 weeks, then give cycle 3 chemotherapy alone, and proceed to surgery as clinically 
indicated. If ipilimumab adverse event has resolved to ≤ grade 1 after surgery, then post -
operative ipilimumab may be started.  
 For postoperative adjuvant or maintenance ipilimumab therapy, delay ipilimumab up to 4 weeks  
for ipilimumab related toxicity and if not recovered to <   grade 1, discontinue ipilimumab.  
11.5.1   Immune -Related Adverse Events (irAEs)  Reactions and Immune -mediated Adverse 
Reactions: Definition, Monitoring, and Treatment  
Blocking CTLA -4 function may permit the emergence of auto -reactive T  cells and resultant clinical 
autoimmunity. Rash/vitiligo, diarrhea/colitis, uveitis/episcleritis, hepatitis, and hypopituitarism were 
drug-related, presumptive autoimmune events, now termed immune -medi ated adverse reactions , noted 
in previous ipilimumab studies.  
For the purposes of this study, an immune -related adverse reaction is defined as an adverse reaction of 
unknown etiology associated with drug exposure and consistent with an immune phenomenon. E fforts 
should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin or other etiologic causes prior to 
labeling an event an immune -related adverse reaction . Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) 
data should be used to support the diagnosis  of an immune -related toxicity. Suspected immune -related 
adverse reactions must be documented on an AE or SAE form. Another term for an irAE is an immune -
mediate adverse reaction, as it is termed in the Ipilimumab US Prescribing Information. Both terms may  
be used in this protocol document.  
Patients should be informed of and carefully monitored for evidence of clinically significant systemic 
immune -mediated adverse reactions  (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus -like diseases) or organ -specific 
immune -mediat ed adverse reaction  (e.g., rash, colitis, uveitis, hepatitis or thyroid disease). If an 
immune -mediated adverse reaction is noted, appropriate work -up (including biopsy if possible) should 
be performed, and steroid therapy may be considered if clinically n ecessary.

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  It is unknown if systemic corticosteroid therapy has an attenuating effect on ipilimumab activity. 
However, clinical anti -tumor responses have been maintained in patients treated with corticosteroids and 
discontinued from ipilimumab. If utilized, corticosteroid therapy should be individualized for each 
patient. Prior experience suggests that colitis manifested as ≥  Grade 3 diarrhea requires corticosteroid 
treatment.  
Specific treatment algorithms for immune -mediated adverse reactions adver se events are included 
see Appendi x K. 
 
11.5.2   Treatment of Infusion Reactions Associated with Ipilimumab   
Since ipilimumab contains only human protein sequences, it is less likely that any allergic reaction will 
be seen in patients. However, it is possi ble that infusion of ipilimumab will induce a cytokine release 
syndrome that could be evidenced by fever, chills, rigors, rash, pruritus, hypotension, hypertension, 
bronchospasm, or other symptoms. No prophylactic pre -medication will be given unless indica ted by 
previous experience in an individual patient. Reactions should be treated based upon the following 
recommendations.  
 For mild symptoms (e.g., localized cutaneous reactions such as mild pruritus, flushing, rash):  
 Decrease  the rate of infusion until recovery from symptoms, remain at bedside and 
monitor patient.  
 Complete  the ipilimumab infusion at the initial planned rate.  
 Diphenhydramine  50 mg IV  may be administered at the discretion of the treating 
physician and patients m ay receive additional doses with close monitoring.  
 Premedication  with diphenhydramine may be given at the discretion of the investigator 
for subsequent doses of ipilimumab.  
 For moderate symptoms (any symptom not listed above [mild symptoms] or below [sever e 
symptoms] such as generalized pruritus, flushing, rash, dyspnea, hypotension with systolic 
BP >80  mmHg):  
 Interrupt  ipilimumab.  
 Administer  diphenhydramine 50  mg IV . 
 Monitor  patient closely until resolution of symptoms.

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016   At the discretion  of the treating physician, ipilimumab infusion may be resumed at one 
half the initial  infusion rate , then increased incrementally to the initial infusion rate.  
 If symptoms  develop after resumption of the infusion, the infusion should be 
discontinued and no additional ipilimumab should be administered that day.

administered prior to dosing with ipilimumab.  
 For severe symptoms (e.g., any reaction such as bronchospasm, generalized urticaria, systolic 
blood pressure 80 mm Hg, or angioedema):  
 Immediately discontinue infusion of ipilimumab, and disconnect infusion tubing from the 
subject.  
 Consider  bronchodilators , epinephrine 1  mg IV or subcutaneously , and/or 
diphenhydramine 50  mg IV , with solumedrol 100  mg IV , as needed.  
 Patients  should be monitored until the investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will 
not recur.  
 No further  ipilimumab will be administered.  
 In case of late -occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g., appearance within one week after 
treatment of a localized or  generalized pruritus), symptomatic treatment may be given (e.g., 
oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids).  
 
 
11.5.3   Treatment of Ipilimumab -Related Isolated Drug Fever  
In the event of isolated drug fever, the investigator must use clinical judgment to de termine if the fever 
is related to the ipilimumab or to an infectious etiology. If a patient experiences isolated drug fever, for 
the next dose, pre -treatment with acetaminophen or non -steroidal anti -inflammatory agent (investigator 
discretion) should be i nstituted and a repeated antipyretic dose at 6 and 12 hours after ipilimumab 
infusion, should be administered. The infusion rate will remain unchanged for future doses. If a patient 
experiences recurrent isolated drug fever following premedication and post  dosing with an appropriate 
antipyretic, the infusion rate for subsequent dosing should be decreased to 50% of the previous rate. If 
fever recurs following infusion rate change, the investigator should assess the patient’s level of 
discomfort with the even t and use clinical judgment to determine if the patient should receive further 
ipilimumab.

Suggested Evaluation and Treatment  for Immune -related Adverse Eve nts: 
Early diagnosis and t reatment intervention for high -grade irAEs can help prevent the occurrence of 
complications such as GI perforation.  Gastrointestinal (diarrhea) and skin (rash) related toxicities are 
the most common irAEs reported in studies with ipilimumab . Suggested eva luation procedures for 
suspected irAEs of the GI tract, liver, skin, eye, pituitary, and adrenal gland are described below.  When 
sypmptomatic therapy is inadequate or inappropriate, an irAE should be treated with systemic 
corticosteroids followed by a gra dual taper.  Infrequently, subjects with irAEs may require courses of 
corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive agents that exceed 4 weeks in duration. It is recommended 
that subjects receiving immunosuppressive agents beyond 4 to 6 weeks should also recei ve 
antimicrobial prophylaxis to protect against the emergence of opportunistic infections. Such 
prophylaxis should include protection against Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly Pcarinii ) and prevalent 
fungal strains, as well as considerations for any additional pathogens that may be indicated by the 
medical history (e.g., herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus) or the environment (e.g., occupation, 
recent travel) of the subject. Consultat ion with infectious disease specialists may be considered. 
Immune -related (ir)AE management algorithms for general irAEs, and ipilimumab related diarrhea, 
hepatotoxicity, endocrinopathy, and neuropathy have been developed and are listed below.  
 
11.5.4.1   Gastrointestinal Tract:  Immune -mediated Enterocolitis  
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, mucus or 
blood in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus) . In 
symptomatic patients, rule out infectious etiologies and consider endoscopic evaluation for persistent or 
severe symptoms.  
Permanently discontinue ipilimumab in patients with severe enterocolitis and initiate systemic 
corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to  2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent . Upon improvement to Grade 
1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least one month. In clinical trials, 
rapid corticosteroid tapering resulted in recurrence or worsening symptoms of en terocolitis in some 
patients.  
63 
Confidential: The information contained in this document is regarded as confidential and may not be disclosed to another part y unless such 
disclosure is required to initiate the study, to conduct study related activities, or t o comply with national, state or local laws and regulations. 
Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  Withhold ipilimumab dosing for moderate enterocolitis; administer anti -diarrheal treatment and, if 
persistent for more than one week, initiate systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day 
prednisone or equivalent.  
The differential diagnosis for subjects presenting with abdominal pain should include colitis, 
perforation, or pancreatitis. Additionally, a few subjects with abdominal pain also had acute swelling of 
the cecal wall on CT scan that may have represented localiz ed inflammation.  
Diarrhea (defined as either first watery stool, or increase in frequency 50% above baseline with urgency 
or nocturnal bowel movement, or bloody stool) should be further evaluated and infectious or alternate 
etiologies ruled out. Subjects s hould be advised to inform the investigator if any diarrhea occurs, even 
if it is mild. An algorithm for managing subjects with diarrhea or suspected colitis is provided in 
Appendix L. 
The majority of subjects with ipilimumab -induced diarrhea or colitis re sponded to symptomatic therapy 
or corticosteroids. Permanent discontinuation of ipilimumab and starting high dose corticosteroid 
therapy (e.g., methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg once or twice per day or equivalent) is strongly 
recommended for ipilimumab related ≥  Grade 3 diarrhea/colitis and steroids should be slowly tapered 
according to symptomatic response over at least 1 month. Subjects with ipilimumab -related Grade 2 
diarrhea/colitis have to skip ipilimumab dosing and may be initially treated conservatively wi th 
loperamide, fluid replacement or budesonide, but should be immediately switched to corticosteroids 
(prednisone 1 mg/kg or equivalent) if symptoms persist for 3 -5 days or worsen. Most subjects with 
diarrhea/colitis will rapidly respond to initiation of c orticosteroids. The dose should be gradually 
tapered over at least a 1 -month duration. Lower doses of prednisone may be considered for less severe 
cases of colitis. It is suggested that prednisone (for oral administration) or methylprednisolone (for IV 
administration) be the corticosteroids of choice in the treatment of colitis. Caution should be taken in 
the use of  narcotics in patients with abdominal pain or colitis/diarrhea as narcotic use may mask  the 
signs of colonic perforation. Infrequently, subjects  will appear refractory to corticosteroids or will flare 
following taper of corticosteroids. In these subjects, unless contraindicated (i.e., sepsis, perforation and 
other serious infections), a single dose of infliximab at 5 mg/kg may provide benefit. For  patients with 
concomitant hepatitis, use of mycophenolate mofetil is recommended in place of infliximab. For 
patients with long term immunosuppressive therapy, administer antimicrobial prophylactics as 
appropriate per institutional guidelines. Such cases should be discussed with the sponsor study medical

acute phase reactants (e.g., increased CRP or platelet count; or bandemia), it is recommended that 
sigmo idoscopy (or colonoscopy, if appropriate) with colonic biopsy of 3 to 5 specimens for standard 
paraffin block be performed. If possible, 1 to 2 biopsy specimens should be snap -frozen an d stored.  
Tests should  also be performed for stool calprotectin and WB Cs. 
 
11.5.4.2   Liver:  Immune -mediated Hepatitis  
Monitor liver function tests (hepatic transaminase and bilirubin levels) and assess patients for signs and 
symptoms of hepatotoxicity before each dose of ipilimumab. In patients with hepatotoxicity, rule ou t 
infectious or malignant causes and increase frequency of liver function test monitoring until resolution.  
Permanently discontinue ipilimumab in patients with Grade 3 –5 hepatotoxicity and administer systemic 
corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day o f prednisone or equivalent . When liver function tests 
show sustained improvement or return to baseline, initiate corticosteroid tapering and continue to taper 
over 1 month.  Across the clinical development program for ipilimumab, mycophenolate treatment  has 
been administered in patients who have persistent severe hepatitis despite high -dose corticosteroids. 
Withhold ipilimumab in patients with Grade 2 hepatotoxicity.  
Liver function tests should always be performed and reviewed prior to administration of all ipilimumab 
doses. Patients treated with ipilimumab may develop elevation in LFT in the absence of clinical 
symptoms. In addition, subjects presenting with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, unexplained 
nausea, or vomiting should have LFTs performed immed iately and reviewed before administering the 
next dose of study drug. Any increase in LFT should be evaluated to rule out non -inflammatory causes 
of hepatotoxicity including infections, disease progression or medications and followed with frequent 
LFT moni toring at 3 -day intervals until resolution.  
Any LFTs ≥ Grade 2 (for subjects with normal baseline LFT) or LFT ≥ 2 times baseline  values (for 
subjects with baseline LFT of Grade 1 or 2) should prompt treating physicians to: (1) contact the  PI; (2) 
increase frequency of monitoring LFTs to at least every 3 days until LFT have stabilized or improved; 
(3) investigate to rule out non -irAE etiologies; and (4) initiate an autoimmunity evaluation.  
Disease progression, other malignancies, concurrent m edications, viral hepatitis, and toxic etiologies 
should be considered and addressed, as appropriate. Imaging of the liver, gall bladder, and bile ducts

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  should be considered to rule out neoplastic or other non -irAE -related causes for the increased LFTs. An  
ANA, perinuclear anti -neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA), and anti -smooth muscle antibody 
test should be performed if an autoimmune etiology is considered. If the LFTs are > 5 times the upper 
limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin is > 3 times the ULN, then ipilimumab dosing should be held 
according to the dose modification guidelines.  
Subjects with LFT elevations > 8x the ULN that are judged to be due to ipilimumab should initiate 
high-dose corticosteroid therapy (e.g., methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg o nce or twice daily or equivalent) 
and permanently stop administration of ipilimumab. In subjects with > 8x ULN, LFT should be 
performed daily until stable or declining for 5 consecutive days. LFT should be monitored for at least 2 
consecutive weeks to ensu re sustained treatment response. If symptoms or LFT elevations are 
controlled, the corticosteroid dose should be gradually tapered over a period of at least 1 month. Flare 
in LFTs during this taper may be treated with an increase in the dose of steroid and  a slower taper. In 
subjects without response to corticosteroid therapy within 3 to 5 days or who have an LFT flare during 
steroid tapering that is not responsive to an increase in steroids, addition of immunosuppression with 
mycophenolate mofetil should b e considered after a gastroenterology/hepatology consult. Patients 
receiving immunosuppression for more than 4 weeks should be evaluated for prophylaxis of 
opportunistic infection s per institutional guidelines.  (Appendix H). 
11.5.4.3   Skin: Immune -mediate d Dermatitis  
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of dermatitis such as rash and pruritus. Unless an alternate 
etiology has been identified, signs or symptoms of dermatitis should be considered immune -mediated.   
Permanently discontinue ipilimumab in patients with Stevens -Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal 
necrolysis, or rash complicated by full thickness dermal ulceration, or necrotic, bullous, or hemorrhagic 
manifestations . Administer systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednison e or 
equivalent.  When dermatitis is controlled, corticosteroid tapering should occur over a period of at least 1 
month.  Withhold ipilimumab dosing in patients with moderate to severe signs and symptoms.  
For mild to moderate dermatitis, such as localized r ash and pruritus, treat symptomatically. Administer 
topical or systemic corticosteroids if there is no improvement of symptoms within 1 week.

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  A dermatologist should evaluate persistent or severe rash or pruritus. A biopsy should be performed if 
appropriate and if possible, photos of the rash should also be obtained.  
Patients with low -grade ipilimumab -mediated skin toxicity (Grade 1 or 2) may remain on therapy and 
could be treated with symptomatic therapy (e.g., antihistamines). Low -grade symptoms  persisting for 1 
to 2 weeks and relapsing should be treated with topical or oral corticosteroid therapy (e.g., prednisone 1 
mg/kg once daily or equivalent). High -grade (Grade 3 or 4) symptoms require high -dose IV 
corticosteroid therapy (e.g., methylpredni solone 2 mg/kg once or twice per day or equivalent) to control 
initial symptoms. A skin biopsy should be performed if appropriate. Once rash or pruritis is controlled, 
the initiation of corticosteroid taper should be based on clinical judgment; however, th e corticosteroid 
dose should be gradually tapered over a period of at least 1 month. Patients with any high -grade skin 
related toxicity (Grade 3 regardless of causality) have to skip ipilimumab and may only continue 
treatment with ipilimumab if the initial  symptoms have improved to ≤ Grade 1, while patients with 
grade 4 skin toxicities have to permanently discontinue ipilimumab.  (Appendix K)  
 
11.5.4.4   Neuropathy:  Immune -mediated Neuropathies  
Monitor for symptoms of motor or sensory neuropathy such as uni lateral or bilateral weakness, sensory 
alterations, or paresthesia. Permanently discontinue ipilimumab in patients with severe neuropathy 
(interfering with daily activities) such as Guillain -Barré -like syndromes.  Institute medical intervention 
as appropri ate for management of severe neuropathy. Consider initiation of systemic corticosteroids at a 
dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent  for severe neuropathies. Withhold ipilimumab dosing  
in patients with moderate neuropathy (not interfering with d aily activities).  
Subjects presenting with sensory symptoms lasting more than 5 days or motor symptoms confirmed by 
physical examinations should be evaluated and non -inflammatory causes such as disease progression, 
infections (including Lyme disease), met abolic syndromes and medications (such as taxanes and/or 
platinum salts) should be ruled out.  A neurology consult should be obtained and diagnostic

started. The next dose of ipilimumab should be skipped if the event of a Grade 2 neuropathy (sensitive 
or motor) is related to study drug. The administration of ipilimumab should be permanently discontinued 
in patients with Grade 3 or 4 sensory neuropathy susp ected to be related to study drug. Patients should 
be treated according to institutional guidelines and the administration of IV steroids (e.g., 
methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg once or twice per day or equivalent) should be considered.  
The administration of ip ilimumab should be permanently discontinued in patients with Grade 3 or 4 
motor neuropathy regardless of the causality to study drug. Patients with Grade 3 or 4 motor neuropathy 
who are clinically stable should be treated according to institution guideline s and the administrat ion of 
IV steroids therapy (e.g., methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg once or twice per day or equivalent) should be 
considered.  
Patients with Grade 3 or 4 motor neuropathy who are not clinically stable or who have atypical 
symptoms should be h ospitalized and the IV administration of steroids should be initiated and IV 
immunoglobulin (IVIg) or other immunosuppressive therapies (as appropriate) should be considered.  
(Refer to Appendix J)  
11.5.4.5   Endocrine:  Immune -mediated Endocrinopathies   
Monitor patient  for clinical signs and symptoms of hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency (including 
adrenal crisis), and hyper - or hypothyroidism. Patients may present with fatigue, headache, mental status 
changes, abdominal pain, unusual bowel habits, and h ypotension, or nonspecific symptoms that may 
resemble other causes such as brain metastasis or underlying disease. Unless an alternate etiology has 
been identified, signs or symptoms of endocrinopathies should be considered immune -mediated.  
Monitor thyroid  function tests  and clinical chemistries at the start of treatment, before each dose, and as 
clinically indicated based on symptoms. In a limited number of patients, hypophysitis was diagnosed by 
imaging studies through enlargement of the pituitary gland. Withhold ipilimumab dosing in 
symptomatic patients.  Initiate systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or 
equivalent, and initiate appropriate hormone replacement therapy .

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  Most subjects with hypopituitarism presented with nonspec ific complaints such as fatigue, visual field 
defects, confusion, or impotence. Some have had headache as the predominant presentation. The 
majority of subjects with hypopituitarism demonstrated enlarged pituitary glands based on brain MRI. 
Low adrenocorti cotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol were the most common biochemical 
abnormality; low TSH, free T4,T3, testosterone or prolactin have also been reported in some subjects . 
Subjects with unexplained symptoms such as fatigue, myalgias, impotence, mental stat us changes, or 
constipation should be investigated for the presence of thyroid, pituitary or adrenal endocrinopathies. An 
endocrinologist should be consulted if an endocrinopathy is suspected. If there are any signs of adrenal 
crisis such as severe dehydra tion, hypotension, or shock, IV corticosteroids with mineralocorticoid 
activity (e.g., methylprednisolone) should be initiated immediately. If the patient’s symptoms are 
suggestive of an endocrinopathy but the patient is not in adrenal crisis, an endocrine  laboratory results 
should be evaluated before corticosteroid therapy is initiated.  
Endocrine work -up should include at least thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 levels. These 
should be obtained to determine if thyroid abnormalities are present.  THS, prolactin and a morning 
cortisol level will help to differentiate primary adrenal insufficiency from primary pituitary 
insufficiency.  
Radiographic imaging (e.g., MRI) with pituitary cuts should be performed. If the pituitary scan and/or 
endocrine lab oratory tests are abnormal, a short course of high dose corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 
4 mg every 6 hours or equivalent) should be considered in an attempt to treat the presumed pituitary 
inflammation, but it is currently unknown if this will reverse  the pituitary dysfunction. Abrupt 
discontinuation of corticosteroids should be avoided due to possible prolonged adrenal suppression. 
Once symptoms or laboratory abnormalities are controlled, and overall patient improvement is evident, 
the initiation of s teroid taper should be based on clinical judgment; however the corticosteroid dose 
should be gradually tapered over a period of at least 1 month. Appropriate hormone replacement therapy 
should be instituted if an endocrinopathy is documented, and it is pos sible that subjects may require life -
long hormone replacement.  (Refer to Appendix I)

The following clinically significant immune -mediated adverse reactions were seen in l ess than 1% of 
ipilimumab -treated patients in Study 1: nephritis, pneumonitis, meningitis, pericarditis, uveitis, iritis, 
and hemolytic anemia. Across the clinical development program for ipilimumab, the following likely 
immune -mediated adverse reactions w ere also reported with less than 1% incidence: myocarditis, 
angiopathy, temporal arteritis, vasculitis, polymyalgia rheumatica, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, 
episcleritis, scleritis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, erythema multiforme, psoriasis, pancreatitis,  arthritis, 
and autoimmune thyroiditis.  
Permanently discontinue ipilimumab for clinically significant or severe immune -mediated adverse 
reactions . Initiate systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent for 
severe immune -mediated adverse reactions.  
Administer corticosteroid eye drops to patients who develop uveitis, iritis, or episcleritis . Permanently 
discontinue ipilimumab for immune -mediated ocular disease that is unresponsive to local 
immunosuppressive therapy.  
Ocular inflammation (episcleritis or uveitis) was reported in a few subjects. These conditions responded 
to topical corticosteroid therapy. An ophthalmologist should evaluate visual complaints with 
examination of the conjunctiva, anterior and posterior chambers, and retina. Visual field testing and an 
electroretinogram should also be performed. Examination and testing should be documented on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF). Ipilimumab -related uveitis orepiscleritis may be treated with topical 
corticosteroid  eye drops.  
Symptoms of abdominal pain associated with elevations of amylase and lipase suggestive of pancreatitis 
may be associated with anti -CTLA -4 monoclonal antibody administration. The differential diagnosis of 
acute abdominal pain should include panc reatitis. Appropriate evaluation should include serum amylase 
and lipase tests.

Liver function tests (AST, ALT, T. bilirubin) will be evaluated for every subject  prior to administration 
of ipilimumab. Blood samples must be collected and analyzed at local or central labs within 3 days prior 
to dosing. LFT results must be reviewed by the principal investigator (or designee) to meet dosing 
criteria specifications:  2.5 x ULN for AST, ALT and  1.5 x ULN for T. bilirubin unless liver 
metastases are present in which case LFT  5 x ULN for AST, ALT and T. bilirubin  3.0 x ULN) prior 
to dosing.  
If, during the course of treatment abnormal LFT values are detected, the subject must be managed using 
the hepatotoxicity algorithm Appendix H.     
11.6 Permanent Discontinuation of Ipilimumab  
11.6.1 Permanent Discontinuation for Related Adverse Events  
Permanently discontinue ipilimumab for any of the following:  
 Persistent moderate adverse reactions or inability to reduce corticosteroid dose to 7.5 mg  
prednisone or equivalent per day.  
 Failure to complete full t reatment course within 18 weeks  from adminis tration of first dose.  
 Severe or life -threatening adverse reactions , including any of the following:  
Colitis with abdominal pain, fever, ileus, or peritoneal signs; increase in stool frequency (7 or 
more over baseline), stool incontinence, need for intrave nous hydration for more than 24 hours, 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and gastrointestinal perforation  
 Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >5 times the upper 
limit of normal or total bilirubin >3 times the upper limit of normal  
 Stevens -Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or rash complicated by full 
thickness dermal ulceration, or necrotic, bullous, or hemorrhagic manifestations  
 Severe motor or sensory neuropathy, Guillain -Barré syndrome, or myasthenia gravis  
 Severe imm une-mediated reactions involving any organ system (eg, nephritis, 
pneumonitis, pancreatitis, non -infectious myocarditis)  
 Immune -mediated ocular disease that is unresponsive to topical immunosuppressive 
therapy  
 Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality or i ntercurrent illness which, in the  
            judgement of the investiga tor presents a substantial clinical risk to the patient with  
            continued dosing.  
 Clinical deterioration of subject’s condition such that further benefit from ipilimumab dos ing 
is unlikely o r requires a change of therapy .

 Potentially reversible inflammation (<  Grade  4), attributable to a local anti -tumor reaction 
and a potential therapeutic response. This includes inflammatory reactions at sites of tumor 
resections or in draining lymph nodes, or at sites suspicious for, but not diagnostic of 
metastasis.  
 Hospitalization for ≤  Grade 2 adverse events where the primary reason for hospitalization is 
to expedite the clinical work -up. 
 Patients with the following conditions where in the investigator’s opinion continuing study 
drug administration is justified:  
 Ocular toxicity that has responded to topical therapy.  
 Endocrinopathies where clinical symptoms are controlled with appropriate ho rmone 
replacement therapy. Note:  Ipilimumab may not be restarted while the patient is being 
treated with systemic corticosteroids except for patients on stable doses of hormone 
replacement therapy such as hydrocortisone.  
 
11.7  Dose Modifications for Obese Patients  
 
There is no clearly documented adverse impact of treatment of obese patients when dosing is performed 
according to actual body weight. Therefore, all dosing is to be determined solely by (1) the patient’s 
BSA as calc ulated from actual weight or (2) actual weight without any modifications unless explicitly 
described in the protocol. This will eliminate the risk of calculation error and the possible introduction 
of variability in dose administration. Physicians who are uncomfortable with administering 
chemotherapy dose(s) based on actual body weight should not enroll obese patients.  
 
11.8. Blinding  
 
This is an open -label study; therefore, each patient will be aware of his or her own assigned treatment. 
All staff involved  in treating and caring for study patients will have full knowledge of treatment 
assignments for those patients under their care.  
 
11.9. Concomitant Therapy  
Patients are allowed to receive full supportive care therapies concomitantly during the study . All 
standard pretreatment and supportive care medications for chemotherapy may be used including 
corticosteroids used for that purpose.  Any disease progression requiring other forms of specific anti -

therapies warrant special attention:  
 
11.9.1  Colony Stimulating Factors  (CSFs)  
 
 The American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines for use of CSF should be followed 
(http://www.asco.org/guidelines/wbcgf ) [64]. Granulocyte colony -stimulating factor (G -CSF) may be 
used for patients who have ANC 0.5x109/L, neutropenic fever, or documented infections while 
neutropenic. Duration of uncomplicated neutropenia before initiation of G -CSF treatment is left to the 
investigator’s discretion. Granulocyte colony -stimulating factor must be discontinued at least 24 hours 
prior to the start of the next cycle of chemotherapy. If a patient develops hematologic toxicities, 
chemotherapy dose reduction and acute treatment of n eutropenia are recommended, rather than 
chemotherapy dose maintenance and pre -emptive treatment with G -CSFs. Use of erythropoietin (e.g., 
Aranesp, Procrit) is allowed. Use of stimulators of thrombopoiesis is not allowed.  
 
 
11.9.2  Antiemetic Agents  
 
For pa tients in both study arms, the use of a prophylactic anti -emetic regimen including a 5 -HT3 
antagonist is suggested. Aprepitant may be used prior to cisplatin.  Anti -emetic therapy should be 
administered according to standard local practice for patients rec eiving mildly to moderately emetic 
chemotherapy regimens and is at the discretion of the treating physician.  
 
11.9.3   Therapy for Diarrhea  
 
In the event of CTC Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, it will be treated like ipilimumab immune related diarrhea 
(see section  11.5.4 Enterocolotis . Refer to Appendix  L). The following supportive measures are 
allowed: corticosteroids, hydration, octreotide, and antidiarrheals.  
 
If diarrhea is severe (requiring intravenous rehydration) and/or associated with fever or severe 
neutropenia (Grade 3 or 4), broad -spectrum antibiotics should be prescribed. Patients with severe

intravenous hydration, correctio n of electrolyte imbalances, and other treatment as necessary.  
 
11.9.4  Therapy for Patients with Febrile Neutropenia  
 
Patients experiencing chemotherapy related febrile neutropenia  should be managed in a hospital setting 
according to standard procedures, with the urgent initiation of intravenous antibiotic therapy.  Refer to 
section 11.9.1 for use of CSFs.  
 
12.0 Prohibited Therapies During the Study  
 
Prohibited Therapies  
 
Patients in this study may not use vaccines for the treatment of cancer or prevention of disease unless 
indicated as a component of the protocol regimen (including those for common medical conditions) for 
up to one -month pre and post dosing with ipilimumab. Concomitant systemic or local anti -cancer 
medications or treatments are prohibited i n this study while r eceiving ipilimumab treatments.  
 
Patients may not use any of the following therapies during the study:   
 Any non -study anti -cancer agent (investigational or non -investigational)  this includes 
chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal cancer therapy, biologics/targeted therapies, 
radiation therapy, surgery for cancer, or experimental medications patients. Any disease 
progression requiring other forms of specific anti -tumor therapy will be cause for early 
discontinuation of study therapy  
 Any ot her investigational agents  
 Any other CTLA -4 inhibitors or agonists . 
 Any anti -PD1 inhibitor or agonist.  
 CD137 agonists  
 Immunosuppressive agents  [except those used to treat ipilimumab related immune related 
adverse events (irAEs) and standard antiemetics & p remedication for paclitaxel or platins].  
 Chronic systemic corticosteroids  unless as physiologic dose for adrenal function 
replacement.

13.0  Treatment Compliance  
 
Patient compliance with study medication will be assessed at each visit. Deviation(s) from the 
prescribed dosage regimen should be recorded in the comments section of the CRF.  
 
 
14.0   Discontinuation  
 
14.1. Discontinuation of Study Patients  
 
If a patient who does not meet enrollment criteria is inadvertently enrolled, that patient should be 
discontinued from the study treatment and the principal investigator must be contacted. In addition, 
patients will  be discontinued from study treatment in the following circumstances:  
 
 There is clear evidence of progressive disease .  
 In previous studies with ipilimumab in solid tumors there has been transient increase in lesion 
size due to inflammatory immune response followed by clear evidence of lesion regression. 
Therefore, CAT scan evidence of progression in the global tumor burden  will not be criteria for 
discontinuation  or by itself deemed evidence of progression on therapy . It is p ossible index 
tumor may enlarge > 25% or new lesions appear after 2 doses Ipilimumab before repeat CAT 
scan.  Surgical staging at time of resection will  verify progression or whether robust 
inflammatory response was mis -interpreted as progression on repeat CAT scans.  
 There is toxicity deemed by the investigator or patient as unacceptable.  
 The patient is noncompliant with study procedures.  
 The investigator  decides that the patient should be withdrawn.  
 Pregnancy:  All WOCBP should be instructed to contact the investigator immediately if they 
suspect they might be pregnant (e.g. missed or late menstrual period) at any time during study 
participation. Institu tional policy and local regulations should determine the frequency of no 
study pregnancy tests for WOCBP enrolled in the study.  The investigator must immediately 
notify BMS in the event of a confirmed pregnancy in a patient participating in the study.  
The patient or attending physician requests that the patient be withdrawn from the study.  
 The investigator, for any reason, stops the study or stops the patient's participation in the study.  
75 
Confidential: The information contained in this document is regarded as confidential and may not be disclosed to another part y unless such 
disclosure is required to initiate the study, to conduct study related activities, or t o comply with national, state or local laws and regulations. 
Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016   Termination of the study by Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS)  
 The patient, f or any reason, requires treatment with another systemic agent potentially effective 
for treatment of the study indication. In this case, discontinuation from the study occurs 
immediately upon introduction of the new agent.  
 A patient who cannot be administe red the study drug after a 21 -day delay must be discontinued 
from the study treatment.  
 Bulky residual a denopathy such that resection is  not attempted will be removed from protocol 
therapy and should receive standard oncology care as deemed appropriate by t he treating 
physician.  
 Subjects with positive surgical margins or N2 disease post -surgery.  
 Withdrawal of informed consent (subject’s decision to withdraw for any reason) . 
 Any clinical adverse event, laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the opinion of 
the investigator, indicates that continued treatment with study therapy in not in the best interest 
of the subject  
 The compulsory detention for the treatment of either a psyhchiatric or physical (e.g. infections 
disease) illness.  
 
For patien ts who discontinue the study treatment early, every effort must be made to complete the post 
treatment summary visit during which time the end -of-therapy procedures described in the Study 
Schedule (Appendix A) should be performed. The post treatment summar y visit  (End of Study=EOS)  
will commence approximately 30 days from the last dose of study drug.  
 
14.2. Discontinuation of Study  
This study can be terminated at any time for any reason by the PI -sponsor or the IRB.  If this occurs, all 
subjects on study should be notified as soon as possible.  Additional procedures and/or follow up should 
occur in accordance with Section 9.0 which describes procedures and process for prematurely 
withdrawn patients.

assure sterility of the prepared solutions, since the drug product does not contain any antimicrobial 
preservatives or bacteriostatic agents.  
 Do not shake product.  
79 
Confidential: The information contained in this document is regarded as confidential and may not be disclosed to another part y unless such 
disclosure is required to initiate the study, to conduct study related activities, or t o comply with national, state or local laws and regulations. 
Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016   Inspect parenteral drug products visual ly for particulate matter and discoloration prior to 
administration. Discard vial if solution is cloudy, there is pronounced discoloration (solution 
may have pale yellow color), or there is foreign particulate matter other than translucent -to-
white, amorph ous particles.  
 
Preparation of Solution  
 Allow the vials to stand at room temperature for approximately 5 minutes prior to preparation 
of infusion.  
 Withdraw the required volume of ipilimumab and transfer into an intravenous bag.  
 Store the prepared solution for no more than 24 hours under refrigeration (2°C to 8°C, 36°F 
to 46°F) or at room temperature (20°C to 25°C, 68°F to 77°F).  
 Discard partially used vials or empty vials of ipilimumab.  
 
Administration Instructions  
 Do not mix ipilimumab with, or administer as an infusion with, other medicinal products.  
 Flush the intravenous line with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 0.5% Dextrose 
Injection, USP after each dose.  
 Administer diluted solution over 90 minutes through an intravenous line containing a 
sterile , non -pyrogenic, low -protein -binding in -line filter  0.2 micron filter . 
See the current Investigator Brochure for additional information on allowable filter types.  The 
infusion must be completed in 90 minutes with a 10 ml normal saline flush at the end.  
Ipilimumab should be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use 
of intravenous (IV) agents. Ipilimumab is administered as an IV infusion only.  
 
15.6   Dose Calculations  
Each patient will receive ipilimumab:  
Calculate Total Dose  as follows:  
Patient body weight in kg x (x) mg = total dose in mg  
Calculate Total Infusion Volume  as follows:  
Total dose in mg ÷ 5 mg/mL = infusion volume in mL  
Calculate Rate of Infusion  as follows:  
 Infusion volume in mL ÷ 90 minutes = rate of infusion in mL/min  x 60 = ml/hr .

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  For example, a patient weighing 114 kg (250 lb) would be administered 1140 mg of ipilimumab (114 
kg x 10 mg/kg = 1140 mg) with an infusion volume of 228 mL (1140 mg ÷ 5 mg/mL = 228 mL) at a 
rate of approximately 2.5 mL/min (228 mL ÷ 90 minutes) x 60 minutes  = 150 ml/hr . 
The total dose must be calculated using the most recent subject weight (obtained within 3 days of the 
dosing visit, and prior to the infusion). Rounding to a whol e number is acceptable. Dose does not 
change unless weight changes > 10% from baseline.  
 
16. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS  
 
16.1 Criteria for Response, Progression, and Relapse (Solid  Tumors)  
 
Patients should be reevaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors  (RECIST 1.1) after 
completion of neoadjuvant ipilimumab and chemotherapy (planned 3 cycles). Unidimensional 
measurements in the largest diameter will be used.  
 
 
16.1.1 Measurable Disease  
 
Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured (select largest, most 
reproducible lesions) in at least one dimension (largest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be 
recorded) as ≥20 mm with x -ray or ≥10 mm with CT scan (CT scan slice thickness ≤5 mm) or MRI. If 
scan has slice  thickness >5mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness. Measurable lesions will also include those that can be directly measured on physical exam 
with calipers and are at least 10 mm. Lesions which cannot be accuratel y measured with calipers should 
be recorded as non -measurable. All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal 
fractions of centimeters).  
 
 
16.1.2 Non-Measurable Disease  
 
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <20 mm with x -ray or 
<10 mm using CT or MRI scan), are considered non -measurable disease. Lesions considered non -
measurable include: bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitic involvement of  skin or lungs, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses/abdominal 
organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  16.1.3 Target Lesions  
 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per  organ (total 5 maximum target lesions) are 
considered target lesions. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging techniques 
or clinically). A sum of the longest diameter (LD)  for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as 
the baseline sum LD .  
The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by whic h to characterize the objective tumor response.  
 
 
16.1.4 Non-Target Lesio ns 
 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline. Non -target lesions include measurable lesions that exceed the maximum numbers 
per organ or total of all involved organs as well as non -measurable lesions. Measurements of these 
lesions are not required but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 
 
 
16.1.5 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable/Evaluable Disease  
 
If subject has measurable disease, all measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation. For 
subjects with evaluable disease only, the sites of disease will be noted at baseline and followed for 
increase or decrease in size and/or new disease. All baseline evaluations should be perf ormed as closely 
as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 30 days before the beginning of the 
treatment, unless otherwise specified.  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be 
used to characterize each identified an d reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination when both methods have been used to 
assess the antitumor effect of a treatment.  
 Clinical lesions : Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In the 
case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate 
the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 CT a nd MRI : These techniques should be performed with cuts of 5 mm or less in slice 
thickness contiguously. If scan has slice thickness >5 mm, the minimum s ize for a 
measur able lesion should be twice the slice thickness. CT is currently the best available 
and reproducible method to measure lesions for response assessment.  
 Laryngoscopy, Endoscopy : Such techniques can be useful to evaluate patients for 
response in SCCHN and may be used in tumor measurement.

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016   Cytology, Histology : These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
 
16.2   Response Crit eria 
 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
       Complete Response (CR): Disappearance  of all target lesions  
 Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease  in the sum of the largest diameter (LD) of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD  
 Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase  and a 5 mm absolute increase in the 
sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since 
the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. If scan showin g new 
lesion is of anatomical region which was not included in baseline scans, it is PD.  
 Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatm ent started  
 
 
 
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level  
 Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD): Persistence of one or more non -target 
lesion(s) and/or maintena nce of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
 Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression (not attributable to different scanning technique or non-tumor ) of existing 
non-target lesions. (‘Unequivocal p rogression’ must be an overall level of substantial 
worsening in non -target disease that is of a magnitude that, even in the presence of SD or 
PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy.) I f scan showing new lesion is of anatomical region which 
was not included in baseline scans, it is PD.

16.21  I mmune -Related Tumor Assessment  
 
Ipilimumab is an immuno -stimulating antibody  with evidence o f anti-cancer activity (durable  
objective response and stable disease) in subjects with advanced mel anoma, including subjects  
with established brain disease. Observations of clinical activity defined by tumor response  
endpoints defined by conventional criter ia (eg, mWHO) may be inadequate to realize the kinetics  
and magnitude of clinical benefit achieved with ipilimumab.  
 
Histopathologic evidence has demonstrated ipilimumab can pr oduce an influx or expansion of  
tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Therefore, early  increases in lesion size detected radiologically or  
upon gross examination could be misinterpreted as progressive tumor growth  and precede objective  
tumor shrinkage. In addition the appearance of new lesions ma y have categorized a subject to  
have progress ive disease using conventional tumor assessment criteria despite the concurrent  
observation of objective tumor responses in pre -existing lesion s and a net reduction in global  
tumor burden that includes the new lesions.  
Therefore, patients with evidence of possible target lesion growth or new lesion appearance will not be 
presumed to have progressed and will proceed to surgery as long as all possible site of disease are 
deemed resectable by the surgeon.  Target Lesions  Non-Target

16.3 Cytology and Histology  
 
If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be  confirmed by 
cytology/histology. These techniques can be used to differentiate betwe en PR and CR in rare cases (for 
example, residual lesions in tumor types such as germ ce ll tumor s, where known residual benign tumors 
can remain). The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that ap pears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor h as met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to diff erentiate between  response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the 
treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
Pathologic Response Criteria  
After receiving preop erative  chemotherapy + Ipilimumab, criteria for examining resected tumor will be 
as follows:  
 No Response no evidence of cell death or tumor necrosis.  
 Partial Response ≥30% tumor necrosis or cell death.  
 Complete Response no evidence of viable tumor in surgical specimen (includes lung tissue 
and dissected lymph nodes ) 
 
 
16.4 Disease -Free Survival  
 Disease -free survival (DFS) is defined as the time from surgical resection to disease recurrence (first 
disease recurrence or death, whichever comes first) after surgery.  
 
 
16.5 Survival  
Survival will be measured from the date of enr ollment.

17.0   Safety  
All patients who receive at least one dose of ipilimumab will be considered evaluable for safety 
parameters. Additionally, any occurrence of non -SAE or SAE from time of consent forward, up to and 
including follow -up visits  will be reported  as per Adverse Event Reporting  sections below.  Safety will 
be evaluated for all treated patients using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0 (http://ctep.cancer.gov). Safety as sessments will be 
based on medical review of adverse event reports and the results of vital sign measurements, physical 
examinations, and clinical laboratory tests.  
 
 
 
 17.1   Documentation of Adverse Events  
 
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of patients who have entered this study and       
for alerting BMS or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered 
an unanticipated benefit to the patient. The in vestigator is responsible for appropriate medical care of 
patients during the study. The investigator remains responsible for following, through an appropriate 
health care option, adverse events that are serious or that caused the patient to discontinue be fore 
completing the study. The patient should be followed until the event is resolved or explained. Frequency 
of follow -up evaluation is left to the discretion of the investigator. Safety measures that will be used in 
the study include physical examination s, and clinical laboratory tests (e.g., hematology, blood 
chemistries, and CrCl). Patients will be rated for toxicity prior to each cycle using the NCI CTCAE scale 
version 4.0. Refer to the Study Schedule (Appendix A) for timing of safety measures.  
 
An adv erse event (AE) is the development of an unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, disease or 
the deterioration of a pre -existing condition that occurs while a patient is enrolled on a clinical trial, 
whether the event is considered related or unrelated to the study treatment. An adverse event is any 
adverse change from the subject’s baseline (pretreatment) condition; including any clinical or lab test 
abnormality that occurs during the course of research after treatment has started.  Adverse events will 
use the descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Toxicity and 
Adverse Event Reporting, Version 4.0 (CTCAE; CTEP home page: http://ctep.info.nih.gov ). 
 
Adverse events can be spontane ously reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, examination, 
or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be questioned 
regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  17.1.1. Adverse Event Reporti ng 
 
 
All adverse clinical experiences, whether revealed by observation, physical examination or other 
diagnostic procedures by the investigator, or reported by the patient, must be recorded regardless of 
treatment or suspected causal relationship. Informat ion for the adverse event should include a 
description with details as to the duration and intensity of each event, the causal relationship to the study 
drug, the action take n with respect to the study drug, and the patient’s outcome. Any adverse event tha t 
is expected, not serious or not related to the research study should be reported as part of the routine 
clinical data. All adverse events should be recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the case 
report form.  
 
If known, the diagnosis of the unde rlying illness or disorder should be recorded, rather than its 
individual symptoms. The following information should be captured for all AEs: onset, duration, 
intensity, seriousness, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and treatment requ ired. If 
treatment for the AE was administered, it should be recorded in the medical record.   
 
 
Subjects having adverse events will be monitored with relevant clinical assessments and laboratory tests 
as determined by the investigator. All adverse events a re to be followed to satisfactory resolution or 
stabilization of the event(s).  
 
Any actions taken and follow -up results must be recorded on the appropriate page of the case report 
form as well as the subject’s source documentation (medical record).  
 
For all adverse events that require the subject to be discontinued from the study, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests must be repeated at clinically appropriate intervals until satisfactory 
resolutions or stabilization of the event(s).  
 
Cases o f pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposures to study drugs should be reported 
for tracking purposes. Additional data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected for regulatory 
reporting and drug safety evaluation. This data also inclu des cases of pregnancies that occur during 
paternal exposures to Bristol Myers Squibb study drug. Lack of drug effect is not an adverse event in 
clinical trials because the purpose of the clinical trial is to establish drug effect.  
 
If a patient never receives study drug, but experiences an adverse event after the informed consent 
document is signed, ONLY events the investigator believes may have been caused by a protocol 
procedure will be reported.  
 
 
87 
Confidential: The information contained in this document is regarded as confidential and may not be disclosed to another part y unless such 
disclosure is required to initiate the study, to conduct study related activities, or t o comply with national, state or local laws and regulations. 
Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  All adverse events occurring after enrollment will be documented and recorded on the CRF and any 
additional required forms. Adverse events are to be reported for 30 days after the patient’s last dose of 
study drug and for any events beyond that time in which the investigator believes the event is related to 
study drug or study related procedures.  
 
Events leading to the clinical outcome of death due to NSCLC  will be included as part of the safety 
and efficacy analyses for this study, and will not be reported as adverse events via CRF  unless the 
investigator bel ieves the event may have been caused by the study drug or drug delivery system.  
 
 
17.1.2. Serious Adverse Events  
 
Study site personnel must alert BMS and the principal investigator immediately of any “serious” 
(defined below) adverse event experienced by a patient. In addition, adverse events must be reported to 
regulatory authorities according to the definitions and timelines specified in the local laws and 
regulations.  
An unexpected adverse event  is any adverse drug experience where the specificity or severity is not 
consistent with the current investigator brochure; or, if an investigator brochure is not available, the 
specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the risk information d escribed in the general 
investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application.  
Serious events are those that result in:  
 death  
 initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization  
 a life -threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)  
 persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 congenital anomaly/birth defect  is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that 
may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon 
appropriate medical and sci entific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require 
intervention [e .g., medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the 
definition above.) Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in  
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that 
do not result in hospitalization.)   
 
The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs:  
 a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department lasting l ess than 24 hours that does 
not result in admission (unless considered an “important medical event” or a life -threatening 
event)  
 admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure  
 routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (eg, routine 
colonoscopy)  
88 
Confidential: The information contained in this document is regarded as confidential and may not be disclosed to another part y unless such 
disclosure is required to initiate the study, to conduct study related activities, or t o comply with national, state or local laws and regulations. 
Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016   medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remedying ill health state that was planned 
before study entry. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases.  
 Admission encountered for a nother life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status and 
requires no medical/surgical intervention (e .g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver 
respite, family circumstances, administrative).  
 
 
Hospitalization for elective surgery or  routine clinical procedure (such as for study drug administration) 
that are not the result of an adverse experience (e.g. elective surgery for a pre -existing condition) are not 
considered SAE’s and should be recorded on the appropriate case report form. H ospitalization and/or 
death that are unequivocally due to progression of disease should not be reported as an SAE . 
 
Exception: BMS will be alerted to a study -specific clinical outcome of death due to progressive disease 
as a serious adverse event only if the investigator deems it to be related to use of the study drug.  
 
Serious adverse event collection begins after the patient has signed informed consent and has received a 
study drug. If a patient experiences an SAE after signing informed consent, but prio r to receiving study 
drug, the event will normally NOT be collected unless the investigator believes the event may have been 
caused by a protocol procedure.  
 
Serious adverse events will be collected for 30 days after the last dose of study drug, and serio us adverse 
events occurring 30 days after a patient is discontinued from the study will NOT be reported unless the 
investigator feels that the event may have been caused by the study drug or a protocol procedure.  
 
 
17.1.3. Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
 
All serious adverse event (SAE) reports should include the patient study number, age, sex, weight, 
severity or reaction, relationship to the study drug(s), date of administration of test medications and all 
concomitant medication and medical treatment prov ided. This information is to be recorded on FORM 
3500 , which can be located at: www.fda.gov/medwatch/getforms.htm . 
 
The SAE report should be comprised of full written summary detailing relevant aspec ts of the adverse 
event in question. Where applicable, information from relevant hospital case records and autopsy reports 
should be obtained. If the investigator does not have all information regarding the event, he/she will not 
wait to received additiona l information, but file the information currently available and update the 
summary when additional information is received. The investigator is to provide an assessment of 
causality at the time of the initial report.  
 
Any adverse event that is serious, une xpected, and/or study related which occurs in any patient in the 
course of their treatment on the research study or within 30 days following cessation of treatment must

Confidential: The information contained in this document is regarded as confidential and may not be disclosed to another part y unless such 
disclosure is required to initiate the study, to conduct study related activities, or t o comply with national, state or local laws and regulations. 
Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  be reported within 24 hours of the investigator learning of its occurre nce. This can be  by phone and 
should be followed promptly by a detailed, written report. In addition, any serious event that is 
unexpected (i.e. not in the current package inserts or the Investigator Brochures) and associated with use 
of the study drug(s), must be reporte d to the FDA within 15 calendar days, or within 7 calendar days if 
the SAE is life -threatening or fatal.  
 
Copies of completed Medwatch forms (FORM 3500) should be sent to:  
 FDA:  Fax # 1 -800-FDA -0178  
 Principal Investigator:  Neal Ready , MD: Fax # 919 -684-8926  
 All SAEs should be faxed or emailed to BMS at:  
Global Pharmacovigilance & Epidemiology  
Bristol -Myers Squibb Company  
Fax Number: 609 -818-3804  
Email: Worldwide.safety@bms.com  
 
Serious adverse events that o ccur on any Duke subject  and/or IND safety reports that are receiv ed from 
BMS will be  processed by the DCI Safety Desk. SAEs /IND Safety reports  will be reported to the DUHS 
IRB per institutional reporting guidelines.  
 
 
17.1.4   Assignment of Adverse Event Intensity and Relationship to Investigational 
Product  
All adverse events, including those that are serious will be graded according to the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.0.  
 
The following categories and definitions of causal relatio nship to investigational product as determined 
by a physician should be used:  
 
Related:  There is a reasonable causal relationship to investigational product administration and  
the adverse event.  
 
Not Related:  There is not a reasonable causal relationship to investigational product 
administration and the adverse event.  
 
The expression “reasonable causal relationship” is meant to convey in general that there are facts (e .g., 
evidence such as de -challenge/re -challenge) or other arguments to suggest a positive  causal relationship.

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  17.1.5   Pregnancy  
 
Sexually active WOCBP must use an effective method of birth control during the  course of the study, in 
a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Before enrolling WOCBP in this clinical study, the 
investigator must review the guideline about study participation for WOCBP which can be found in the 
GCP Manual for Investigators. The topics include the following:  
 General Information  
 Informed Consent Form  
 Pregnancy Prevention Information Sheet  
 Drug Interactions with Hormonal Contraceptives  
 Contraceptives in Current Use  
 Guidelines for the Follow -up of a Reported Pregnancy.  
 
Before study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during 
study participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. The subject must sign 
an informed consent form documenting this discussion.  
All WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test within 72  hours before receiving ipilimumab.  
The minimum sensitivity of the pregnancy test must be 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG. If the 
pregnancy test is positive, the subject must not receive ipilimumab and must n ot be enrolled in the study.  
 
In addition, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact the investigator immediately if they 
suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) at any time during study 
participation.  
 
If, following initiati on of the investigational product, it is subsequently discovered that a study subject is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of investigational product exposure, including during at 
least 6 half -lives after product administration, the investigat ional product will be permanently 
discontinued in an appropriate manner (e .g., dose tapering if necessary for subject safety). The 
investigator must immediately notify BMS of this event and record the pregnancy on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form (not an SA E form). Initial information on a pregnancy must be reported immediately 
to BMS, and the outcome information provided once the outcome is known. Completed Pregnancy 
Surveillance Forms must be forwarded to BMS according to SAE reporting procedures.

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  Any preg nancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be reported to the 
sponsor. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  
 
Protocol -required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up m ust be performed on the subject 
unless contraindicated by pregnancy (e.g., x -ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy follow -up 
procedures should be considered if indicated. In addition, the investigator must report to BMS, and 
follow -up on information re garding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome. Infants should be followed for a minimum of 8  weeks.  
 
 
17.1.6   Other Safety Considerations  
 
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, electrocardiograms, x -
rays, and any other potential safety assessments, whether or not these procedures are required by the 
protocol, should also be recorded in the medical record.  
 
17.1.7   Safety Oversight Committee (SOC)  
 
The Duke Cancer Institute SOC i s responsible for annual data and safety monitoring of DUHS sponsor -
investigator phase I and II, therapeutic interventional studies that do not have an independent Data 
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The primary focus of the SOC is review of safety data, toxicities and 
new information that may affect subject safety or efficacy. Annual safety reviews includes but may not 
be limited to review of safety data, enrollment status, stopping rules if applicable, accrual, toxicities, 
reference literature, and inter im analyses as provided by the sponsor -investigator.  The SOC in concert 
with the DCI Monitoring Team (see Section 12.1 for Monitoring Team description) oversees the 
conduct of DUHS cancer -related, sponsor -investigator therapeutic intervention and preventi on 
intervention studies that do not have an external monitoring plan, ensuring subject safety and that the 
protocol is conducted, recorded and reported in accordance with the protocol, standing operating 
procedures (SOPs), Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and  applicable regulatory requirements.

18.1   Monitoring Plan  
Review of this protocol begins with an initial review by the CPC , Cancer Center Protocol Committee 
(CPC), which performs a risk assessment of the trial. The PI will abide by their assessment of the level 
of risk, which will determine the intensity of subsequent external monitoring. Documentation of this 
assessment will be maintained.  
 
The clinical research study will be monitored both internally by the PI and by the Duke Cancer Institute 
(DCI) Monitoring Team in accordance with their NCI -approved “Institutional Protocol Monitoring 
Procedures and Guidelines for NIH -sponsored Research Inv olving Human Subjects”.   The monitoring 
team will conduct visits to ensure subject safety and to ensure that the protocol is conducted, recorded 
and reported in accordance with the protocol, standard operating procedures, good clinical practice, and 
applic able regulatory requirements.  As specified in the DCI monitoring plan, they will conduct routine 
monitoring after the third subject is enrolled, followed by annual monitoring of 1 -3 subjects until the 
study is closed to enrollment and subjects are no long er receiving study interventions that are more than 
minimal risk.  
Additional monitoring may be prompted by findings from monitoring visits, unexpected frequency of 
serious and/or unexpected toxicities, or other concerns and may be initiated upon request of  DUHS and 
DCI leadership, the DCI Cancer Protocol Committee, the Safety Oversight Committee (SOC),  the 
sponsor, Principal Investigator, or the IRB.  All study documents must be made available upon request 
to the DCI Monitoring Team and other authorized reg ulatory authorities, including but not limited to the 
National Institute of Health, National Cancer Institute, and the FDA.  
 
In terms of internal review, the PI  (with the help of the statistician)  will continuously monitor and 
tabulate adverse events. Appr opriate reporting to the Duke University Medical Center IRB will be made. 
If an unexpected frequency of grade 3 or 4 events occurs, depending on their nature, action appropriate 
to the nature and frequency of these adverse events will be taken. This may re quire a protocol 
amendment, dose de -escalation, or potentially closure of the study. The PI of this study will also 
continuously monitor the conduct, data, and safety of this study to ensure that:

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016   Interim analyses occur as scheduled (if applicable);  
 Stopping rules for toxicity and/or response are met;  
 Risk/benefit ratio is not altered to the detriment of the subjects;  
 Appropriate internal monitoring of adverse events and outcomes is done;  
 Over -accrual does not occur;  
 Under -accrual is addressed with approp riate amendments or actions;  
 Data are being appropriately collected in a reasonably timely manner.  
 
 
 
18.2 Audits  
 
The Duke School of Medicine Clinical Trials Quality Assurance (CTQA) office may conduct audits to 
evaluate compliance with the protocol and the principles of GCP.  The PI agrees to allow the CTQA 
auditor(s) direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate his/her time and the time of the study 
team to the CTQA auditor(s) in order to discuss findings and any relevant issues.  
 
CTQA audits  are designed to protect the rights and well -being of human research subjects. CTQA audits 
may be routine or directed (for cause). Routine audits are selected based upon risk metrics generally 
geared towards high subject enrollment, studies with limited ov ersight or monitoring, Investigator 
initiated Investigational Drugs or Devices, federally -funded studies, high degree of risk (based upon 
adverse events, type of study, or vulnerable populations), Phase I studies, or studies that involve 
Medicare populatio ns. Directed audits occur at the directive of the IRB or an authorized Institutional 
Official.  
 
CTQA audits examine research studies/clinical trials methodology, processes and systems to assess 
whether the research is conducted according to the protocol ap proved by the DUHS IRB. The primary 
purpose of the audit/review is to verify that the standards for safety of human subjects in clinical trials 
and the quality of data produced by the clinical trial research are met. The audit/review will serve as a 
qualit y assurance measure, internal to the institution. Additional goals of such audits are to detect both 
random and systemic errors occurring during the conduct of clinical research and to emphasize “best 
practices” in the research/clinical trials environment.

19.0. Investigator Responsibilities  
 
The conduct of the study will comply with all FDA safety reporting requirements.  
Serious adverse events (SAE) will be recorded on the Duke IRB Adverse Event Reporting Form and 
will be reviewed and signed by the prin cipal investigator. Only adverse events that are deemed to be 
serious, unexpected and related, or possibly related to the research must be reported to the Duke 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with institutional policy.  
 
If the investigator l earns of any SAE, including death or congenital abnormality at any time after a 
subject has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonable related to the 
study drug, the investigator should promptly file a report.  
 
 
 
20.0. Departure from the Protocol  
 
There should be no departure from the protocol if at all possible. If an emergency occurs that requires 
departure from this protocol, the principal investigator or other physician in attendance in such an 
emergency will, if cir cumstances and time permit, contact the PI immediately by phone. Such contacts 
with the PI will be made to permit a decision as to whether or not the subject will be continued on study. 
Such departures need to be clearly documented on the Duke Notification  of Protocol 
Deviation/Violation form.  A protocol deviation or violation  is reportable to the IRB if the event is likely 
to adversely affect: (i) the rights and welfare of the research subject; (ii) the safety of the research 
subject; (iii) the integrity o f the research data; and/or (iv) the subject’s willingness to continue study 
participation. Such events should be reported to the DUHS IRB within 10 business days  of the time the 
PI becomes aware of the event; however, an unanticipated study -related death m ust be reported to 
the DUHS IRB within 24 hours of the occurrence of the event .

All subject data will be identified by a subject identification number and subject initials only to protect 
the subject’s privacy . The data will be blinded accordingly in all data analysis. Subject names or 
identifiers will not be used in reports, presentations at scientific meetings, or publications in scientific 
journals.  
However, in compliance with federal guidelines, the investigator will permit r epresentatives from the 
Duke School of Medicine Compliance Office and/or Duke Cancer Institute Monitoring team to review 
that portion of the subject’s medical record that is directly related to the study. This will include all 
relevant study documentation including medical histories to verify eligibility, laboratory test results to 
verify transcri ption accuracy, X -ray reports, a dmission/discharge summaries for hospital/outpatient 
admissions while the subject is on -study, and autopsy reports for deaths occur ring during the study. As 
part of the required content of the informed consent, the subject will be informed that his medical record 
may be reviewed. Should access to the medical record require a separate waiver or authorization, it is 
the PI’s responsibil ity to obtain such permission from the patient in writing before the subject is entered 
into the study.  
 
22.0. Institutional Review  
Prior to patient accrual, this protocol and the protocol informed consent must be approved in writing by 
the Cancer Center Protocol Committee (CPC) of the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center and the DUHS 
Institutional Review Board (IRB). A signed and dated statement that the protocol and informed consent 
have been approved by the CPC/IRB will be kept in the study binder in the Pr incipal Investigator’s staff 
office. The term of study approval will not exceed one year. A progress report will be submitted 
annually to the IRB and re -approval obtained to continue the study. The IRB will also approve any 
significant changes to the proto col as well as a change of PI.  The PI will report to the IRB any changes 
in the research protocol and all unanticipated problems involving risks to human subjects and others. No 
changes will be made in the research activity without IRB approval  Records of all study review and 
approval documents will be kept on file by the PI and/or his/her staff. Adverse events will be reported to 
the IRB per institutional reporting guidelines. The IRB will receive notification of the completion of the 
study and final repor t within 3 months of study completion or termination. The PI will maintain an 
accurate and complete record of all submissions made to the IRB, including a list of all reports and 
documents.

23.0 Informed Consent/Informed Consent Process      
 
The PI or des ignee will fully explain the purpose and potential risks and benefits of the study to the 
patient prior to enrollment, and address any questions posed by the patient. In accordance with federal 
guidelines, all patients will sign a statement of informed con sent, which has been approved by the IRB. 
The patient will receive a copy of the executed consent document. The signed consent will be retained at 
the investigative site for each patient. The informed consent document serves as authorization as deemed 
unde r HIPAA and contains the appropriate statements regarding privacy and confidentiality of protected 
health information (PHI) as well as information on withdrawal from the study. The investigator or 
designee will explain to each patient (or legally authorize d representative) the nature of the study, its 
purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, the potential risks and benefits, and any 
discomfort the study may entail. Each patient will be informed that participation in the study is 
voluntary an d that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will 
not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician.  The patient 
will have as much time as he/she may need to make an informed  decision about the study and all 
treatment related questions will be answered. The consent discussion should occur in an exam room or a 
private area where it is just the research staff, the patient and his/her family/significant other(s) if 
desired.  
The i nformed consent will be given by means of a standard written statement, written in non -technical 
language. For those that cannot rea d, or are blind, the consenter will read the  consent form verbatim in 
the presence of a witness. The patient will read and c onsider the statement before signing and dating the 
document, and should be given a copy of the signed document. If the patient is unable to sign, make 
another kind of mark (like an X) to indicate consent. The person obtaining consent will document at the 
bottom of the consent form that the consent was read out loud to the patient by (name of person

24.2   Case Report Forms  
 
An electronic CRF (eCRF) will be the primary data collection document for the study.  The electronic 
records of subject data will be maintained using a dedicated database (Oracle Clinical or Redcap)  which 
is housed in an en crypted and password -protected DCI file server).  Access to electronic databases will  
be limited to the PI and designated study staff listed on key personnel.   Subject data may be stored 
temporarily on encrypted and password -protected portable memory devic es such as flash drives and 
external hard drives, but only when absolutely necessary.  Data stored on portable memory devices will 
be de -identified.  Subject data will be deleted from the portable memory device at the earliest 
opportunity.  The security an d viability of the IT infrastructure will be managed by the DCI and/or Duke 
Medicine.   
The CRFs will be updated in a timely manner following acquisition of new source data.  Only the PI and 
designated staff (as listed on key personnel), will be permitted to make entries, changes, or corrections 
in the eCRF.  
An audit trail will be maintained automatically by the eCRF management system. (RedCap or Oracle 
Clinical  database ).  All users of this system will complete user training as required or appropriate per 
regulations.  
 
Users of the electronic CRF will have access based on their specific roles in the protocol.   
 
Completeness of entered data will be checked automatically by the eCRF system, and users will be 
alerted to the presence of data inconsistencies.  Additionally, the data manager and/or designess (per key 
personnel) will cross -reference the data to verify accuracy.  Missing or implausible data will be 
highlighted for the PI requiring appropriate responses (i.e. confirmation of data, correction of data , 
completion or confirmation that data is not available, etc.).  
 
The database will be reviewed and discussed prior to database closure, and will be closed only after 
resolution of all remaining queries.  An audit trail will be kept of all subsequent change s to the data.  
 
All medical terms will be coded with MedDRA(Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities).  
Medication will coded according to the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary.

25.0 Appropriateness of Measurements  
There are no sur rogate endpoints used in this study. All efficacy and safety assessments used in this 
study are standard and appropriate for an oncology study.  
 
 
26.0 Statistical Methods and Analytical Plans  
 
26.1. General Considerations  
 
STATISTIC AL CONSIDERATIONS : 
 
Sample size justification  
The primary objective of the phase II trial is to determine the proportion of early stage lung cancer patients 
with detectable circulating T cells specific against TAA after receiving platinum based neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy plus i pilimumab before surgery.  Based on Duke ICS assessments over the past 8 years,  
“detectable” circulating T cells with specificity against TAA are defined as a CD8, CD4, and DP 
(CD4+CD8+) lymphocyte percentage of ≥ 0.05% with each value also being at least twice that of the 
background unstimulated control value ( see Appendix B of the correlative science measures for additional 
details) . It was found that the proportion of patients before or without the treatment  with “detectable” 
circulating T cells specific  against TAA is 0 -1%. Let p be the true proportion of patients with “detectable” 
100 
Confidential: The information contained in this document is regarded as confidential and may not be disclosed to another part y unless such 
disclosure is required to initiate the study, to conduct study related activities, or t o comply with national, state or local laws and regulations. 
Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  circulating T cells at Collection 3 after receiving the protocol treatment ipilimumab of any dose. For the 
purpose of sample size determination, we assume that the null hypoth esis H0: p<0.01 is tested against the 
alternative hypothesis H1: p>0.20. With a sample size of 25 evaluable patients treated with the ipilimumab, 
we have approximately 90% power to test the above hypothesis using a one -sided binomial test at a 
significance  level of 0.010. The null hypothesis H0 will be rejected if 3 or more patients are found with 
detectable circulating T cells specific against TAA after the treatment.  Assuming a 5% screening failure 
rate, the study will enroll a total of 30 patients. A pa tient is deemed “evaluable” if the patient meets 
eligibility criteria, receives the protocol treatment ipilimumab of any dose before Collection 3, and the 
levels of circulating T cells against TAA are measurable at Collection 3. All treated patients will b e 
evaluated for treatment related adverse events and followed for tumor response and disease free survival.  
 
Futility Analysis  
Futility analysis is often used for assessing clinical efficacy before the trial reaches target accrual and stops 
the trial earl y if the therapy clearly performs worse than control. The primary objective of this one -arm 
phase II trial is not to evaluate the efficacy of ipilimumab in this population. Since it is unlikely that the 
therapy will harm the patients, a futility analysis o n the percentage of patients with detectable T -cells is 
unnecessary . 
   
Adverse event monitoring  
The first 12 treated patients will be evaluated for AE’s attributable to the preoperative treatment. Overall, if 
3 or more of the first 12 treated patients (> 25%) experience grade 3-5 non-hematologic adverse events 
(excluding diarrhea and rash) that are probably, possibly, or definitely related to the preoperative treatment, 
OR if the number of treatment -related deaths from the first  treatment until  30 days  after surgery  is 2 or 
more among the first 12 patients (>17%), accrual to the study will be suspended to allow for 
investigation.  After consideration by the study team and the IRB, a decision will be made as to whether 
accrual can be resumed, potentially with  modifications to entry criteria and/or study conduct.   In addition, 
all toxicity patterns will be monitored by the DCI Safety Oversight Committee. Postoperative ipilimumab 
will not be included in toxicity monitoring to determine continued accrual.  
 
Evaluation of Investigational Therapy Feasibility  
101 
Confidential: The information contained in this document is regarded as confidential and may not be disclosed to another part y unless such 
disclosure is required to initiate the study, to conduct study related activities, or t o comply with national, state or local laws and regulations. 
Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  Adverse events in the first 10 patients with computerized data were analyzed according to the guidelines in 
the above section. It became apparent that it was difficult to accurately attribute adverse events  to standard 
chemotherapy, ipilimumab, or other causes. Further it seemed that analysis of treatment toxicities as 
isolated events did not best represent whether or not the combination of chemotherapy plus ipilimumab 
follow by surgery is safe and feasible.  As of June 28, 2014, a total of 15 patients were registered and 
treated. Therefore, safety and feasibility for the remainder of the trial will be evaluated whenever additional 
5 patients have been treated by assessing: 1) whether the cumulative percentage  of deaths among all treated 
patients related to any of the study treatments from the first ipilimumab treatment until 30 days after surgery 
exceeds 17%, and 2) if the cumulative percentage of all treated patients deemed unable to go to surgery due 
to adve rse events attributed to neoadjuvant therapy exceeds 20%.  The percentage of patients unable to go 
to surgery after chemotherapy is a conservative estimate based on data reported for a SWOG trial that 
studied neoadjuvant chemotherapy in early state lung ca ncer (22).  The trial will be stopped for accrual 
whenever a total of 30 patients are registered or at least one of the thresholds of the safety and feasibility 
criteria is exceeded. In the event either of these two thresholds is exceeded, the investigatio nal therapy will 
be considered “inf easible ” in this setting.  
 
 
 
 
Analytic methods  
The primary outcome will be analyzed using the evaluable patients as defined in the sample size 
justification section.  The exact binominal test will be used to test the incr ease in the proportion of patients 
with detectable circulating T cells specific against TAA after the treatment. The proportion will be 
estimated and its 2 -sided 98% confidence interval will be given to be consistent with the nominal 1 -sided 
significance level of 0.  01 used in the sample size justification.  All secondary objectives are considered 
exploratory in nature, and type I error will not be controlled for multiplicity. P -values for these statistical 
tests will be provided for descriptive purposes.  . All treated patients will be included in the analysis of 
adverse events.  
 
The following statistical analyses will be conducted on the secondary objectives:  
(1) Feasibility/tolerability of neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and surgery.  Based on data 
provided by Pisters et al (Pisters et al. J Clin Oncol. 2010 April 10; 28 (11): 1843 -1849), the following 
102 
Confidential: The information contained in this document is regarded as confidential and may not be disclosed to another part y unless such 
disclosure is required to initiate the study, to conduct study related activities, or t o comply with national, state or local laws and regulations. 
Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  criteria would be considered evidence of not feasible/tolerable: less than 75% of subjects receive 3 
cycles of preoperative therapy (i.e. receive  some amount of the expected study medications each cycle), 
“less than 80% of subjects undergo surgical exploration  within 42 days of day 1 of the last cycle of 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy” , more than 10% of subjects undergoing lobectomy have surgery -related 
mortality, or more than 20% of subjects experience dose -limiting toxicity during neoadjuvant therapy. 
Dose -limiting toxicity will be defined as  possibly, probably or definitely treatment -related :  ≥ Grade 4 
hematologic toxicity (excluding Grade 4 neutropen ia without fever or infection), or ≥ Grade 3 non -
hematologic toxicity (excluding grade 3 fatigue, nausea, vomiting, peripheral neuropathy, chemotherapy 
infusion reaction to carboplatin or paclitaxel).  
 
(2) Evaluate disease -free survival and patterns of me tastases after neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus 
ipilimumab in early stage NSCLC. Disease -free survival (DFS) is defined as the time from surgical 
resection to disease recurrence (first disease recurrence or death, whichever comes first) after surgery. The 
Kaplan-Meier estimator will be used to estimate median DFS and its 95% confidence interval. The 
frequencies of metastases by site will be tabulated.  
 
 (3)  The relationship between pathologic response and the RECIST response will be explored by looking at 
a frequency cross -tabulation of pathologic versus RECIST response.  
 
 
The following exploratory objectives  will be conducted:  
 
(1) Determine the percentage of patients with “detectable” ( percentage of ≥ 0.05% with each value also 
being at least twice that of the background unstimulated control value)  tumor infiltrating lymphocytes 
(TILs) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus ipilimumab. The percentage of patients with TILs for patients 
who have surgical resection and its 95% exact confidence interval will be est imated. See Appendix B of the 
correlative science measures for additional details on identifying TILs.  
 
(2) Estimate the  pathologic response rate for neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus ipilimumab in early stage 
NSCLC. The definition of pathologic response rate  is given in section 16.3. The pathologic response rate 
along with its 95% exact confidence interval will be estimated.  
103 
Confidential: The information contained in this document is regarded as confidential and may not be disclosed to another part y unless such

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016   
(3) Estimate the objective response rate of neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus ipilimumab in early stage 
NSCLC. Best response rate is of in terest and tumor response will be evaluated from treatment initiation to 
prior to surgery. The definition of objective response will be measured by RECIST 1.1. The objective 
response rate (ORR=CR+PR) along with its 95% exact confidence interval will be est imated.  
 
(4) Determine if the immunomodulatory effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus ipilimumab  impact the 
suppressive mechanisms, restoring functional reactivity to important anti -tumor effector cell populations.  
Functional TAA -specific T cell react ivities will be measured in the blood at four time points: Collection 1, 
2, 3 and 4. Changes in measures of anti -TAA reactivity (see Appendix B for details about these correlative 
science measures) across time points will be visualized using boxplots with the mean, median and 
interquartile range for each time point. For the phenotypic reactivity measures with background 
unstimulated negative control values  (from the ICS panel) , the percentage of patients with a positive 
response (a percentage value greater than the background unstimulated negative  control value) will be 
calculated.   A Wilcoxon  signed rank test will be used to test for differences from baseline, as well as for 
any association between each reactivity measure and pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy.  
 
(5) Explore an alternative definition for detectability suitable for expression values generated using Boolean 
gating, and determine the percentage of patients w ith circulating T cells meeting this definition.  The 
percentage of patients with circulating T cells meeting the new definition of detectable and its 95% exact 
confidence interval will be estimated.  See Appendix B for additional details about this outcom e measure.  
 
(6) Evaluate whether presence, quantity or quality of detectable TILs is associated with pathologic response 
to neoadjuvant therapy. Quality of TILs (also called relative polyfunctionality) is defined as ≥2 
functional marker values (out of 4) that meet the definition of detectable described in Objective 5. See 
Appendix B  for additional details about this outcome measure. A Fisher exact test will be used to evaluate 
the association of both the presence and the quality of TILs with pathologic tum or response to neoadjuvant 
therapy. A Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to test the association of the quantity of TILs and 
pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy.

Appendix B     Correlative Science Measures  
 
Primary Objective  
 
The primary endpoint is the proportion of early stage lung cancer patients with detectable 
circulating T cells specific against TAA after receiving platinum based chemotherapy plus 
ipilimumab before surgery.  Detectable circulating T cells with specificity against TAA will be 
identified using the following process:  
 
Whenever individual patient tumor tissue is available for analysis, the expression of 10 highly 
conserved TAA ’s (see Table I below) will be assessed using standard Real -Time (RT) PCR 
technology. Peptide pools represent ing the three most highly expressed TAA ’s by each tumor 
will serve as antigen -specific stimulators for PBMC isolated from the same patient at the 4 
specified time  points. If no tumor tissue is available for TAA expression analysis, peptide pools 
representi ng the three most commonly expressed TAA ’s on NSCLC, namely Survivin, PRAME, 
and MAGE -A3, will be chosen as antigen -specific stimulators . 
 
The percentage of CD4, CD8, and double positive (DP=CD4+/CD8+) lymphocytes with 
specificity against the three  selected TAA ’s,  will be calculated for each of 4 individual 
functional markers (IL -2, TNF -α, IFN -γ, and CD107 underlined below).  For each peripheral 
blood collection, the lab will generate a total of 12 lymphocyte values (4 values each for CD4, 
CD8 and DP) for each of the three TAA’s and for CD3/CD28  (used as a positive control), as 
well as generating 12 background  unstimulated negative control  values.  All values will be

Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  expressed as percentages.  A patient will be considered to have detectable circulat ing T cells if 
≥1 of the 36 percentage values (12 values * 3 TAA’s) satisfies the definition of “detectable” as 
described in section 26.0 (a lymphocyte percentage of ≥0.05% at the pre -surgical peripheral 
blood collection (Collection 3) with each value also  being at least twice that of the background  
unstimulated negative  control value).

Confidential: The information contained in this document is regarded as confidential and may not be disclosed to another part y unless such 
disclosure is required to initiate the study, to conduct study related activities, or t o comply with national, state or local laws and regulations. 
Written authorization from the coordinating site and/or sponsor is required for disclosure.                     Version 3.0: March 10, 2016  Using the same methods noted above, 12 lymphocyte percentage values (functional markers) for 
the 3 selected TAA’s w ill also be generated from tumor tissue collected at surgery, and in this 
context are called tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).  These values will be used to determine 
the percentage of patients with any detectable TILs (exploratory objective 1).  Expr ession 
percentage values for each T cell (CD4, CD8, and DP) will also be collected corresponding to 
each combination of the 4 functional markers (excluding the combination where all four markers 
are negative) using Boolean gating. These 135 values (15 valu es * 3 T cells * 3 TAA’s) will be 
used to determine a definition of detectability suitable for these measures to avoid missing 
potential positive values, and to determine the percentage of patients with ≥1 of the 135 values 
satisfying the new definition of  detectable circulating T cells (exploratory objective 5).  In 
addition, this definition will also be used to explore whether the presence, quantity or quality of 
TILs is associated with pathologic response (exploratory objective 6).   
 
* Boolean gating will be performed to calculate percentage values corresponding to the 
following combinations of T cells and functional markers (excluding the combination 
where all 4 markers are negative):  
 
* %CD4 +/CD69+/ -IL-2+ or -TNF -α+ or -IFN-γ+ or -CD107 + or -  
* %CD8 +/CD69+ -IL-2+ or -TNF -α+ or -IFN-γ+ or -CD107 + or - 
* %DP+/CD69+/ -IL-2+ or -TNF -α+ or -IFN-γ+ or -CD107 + or - 
 
For exploratory outcome 4, changes in all  measures of anti -TAA reactivity listed below across time 
points will be analyzed, as well as how these  values relate to pathologic response .   In addition, for 
the  phenotypic reactivity measures with background unstimulated negative  control values  (those 
from the ICS panel) , the percentage of patients with a positive response (a percentage value 
greater t han the background unstimulated negative  control value) will be calculated.   The 
distribution of the changes will b e estimated with a boxplot and the median (mean) change will 
be calculated by path ologic  response status (yes/no).

Blood volumes and collection time points:  
 
 At each blood collection, 4 tubes of 8.5 -ml each will be collected. The tubes used will be ACD 
anti-coagulated Vacutainer (yellow tops). The following time points will  have blood collections:  
 
Collection 1: Baselin e prior to treatment initiation  
Collection 2: cycle 2, day 1 chemotherapy prior to ipilimumab infusion  
Collection 3: 21 -36 days after completion of cycle 3 chemotherapy prior to surgery  
Collection 4: 3 -6 weeks after post -op ipilimumab dose #2.  
 
Once ACD tubes collected, Dr. Weinhold’s lab to be contacted for pick up as PBMC should 
ideally occur within 4 hours of drawn @ 919 -684-3754. Tubes are to remain ambient 
(refrigeration will limit ability to recover PBMC).  
DTRI -IM Sample Transport Record  form to be completed to accompany tube to Dr. Weinhold’s

Appendix G   Tumor  Tissue  Specimen for correlative sciences  
 
SURGICAL SPECIMEN  
 
Patients will be approached to participate in the “DUHS Biospecimen Repository and Processing Core 
(BRPC)” eIRB 35974 protocol prior to surgery.  Tissue will be collected and released as described in this 
protocol to ensure proper involvement of pathology to minimize the chance that a tissue collection event 
interferes with appropriate clinical tissue processin g and diagnosis.  
 
 
PRINCIPLE:  
Lung tissue is harvested in the frozen section or gross dissection area of the surgical pathology suite.  The 
tissue is first examined by a certified anatomic pathologist or surrogate (resident, pathology assistant). 
Relevant margins are inked, removed and examined by frozen section analysis, if necessary. It is imperative 
that harvesting tissue for use in research trials does not impede accurate initial assessment of critical features 
of the tumor resection, most notably margi n status.  After the specimen has been processed for margin 
status, the frozen section assessment of the specimen is complete, a specimen of excess tumor will be 
released and acquired by the tumor immunology correlative science staff for isolation of tumor  infiltrating 
lymphocytes for purposes of this protocol.   
 
 
SPECIMEN: Lung resection specimen  
 
LOCATION: Surgical Pathology Suite  
 
QUALITY CONTROL:  
Lab guidelines for safe handling of all samples must be followed. All tubes used for specimen processing 
must be labeled with the unique patient identifier or sample number before transfer of the tissue sample.

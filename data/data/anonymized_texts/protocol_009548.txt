This is a n open -label, multicenter, single arm study evaluating the  BP changes from baseline 
(Visit 3) to post -treatment (Visit 5)  assessed by ABPM in LPCN 1021 treated a dult hypogonadal 
male subjects .  
The study is comprised of six scheduled visits: Visit 1 and 2 are for screening, Visit  3 is 
scheduled on Day -4 (±2 day) to assess subject’s baseline BP and PR via ABPM.  Visit 4 is to 
enroll subjects, and  to provide subjects with study medication for the start of dosing. Visit 5 is to 
assess subject’s post-treatment  BP and PR via ABPM .  Visit 6 is to perform exit procedures.  
There are two confinement visits during the study of approximately 30 hours each (prior to start 
of the dosing and at the end of the study).  The study visits are d escribed below.  
Visit 1 & 2: Subjects will undergo a screening period to complete the pre -study examinations 
and to confirm  their hypogonadal status. Serum total testosterone (T)  below lab normal range  
based on two consecutive blood samples obtained betwee n 6 and 10 AM, on two separate days at 
approximately the same time of day, following an appropriate washout of current androgen 
replacement therapy will be used for screening T levels.  
MRI -1 (Window: any time between Visit 2 and Visit 4) : The MRI -1 baseli ne MRI -PDFF 
measurement will be performed between Visit 2 and Visit 4 in a subset of study subjects 
(approximately 20 or more subjects).  Following confirmation of a subject’s hypogonadal status 
at Visit 2, sites will schedule a MRI -1 at a local MRI facili ty for the subject.  MRI -1 will be 
performed for all subjects reaching Visit 4 after implementation of Protocol Version 04 until 
target enrollment is reached.  MRI -1 will not be performed for subjects who have already 
progressed past Visit 4  at the time of Version 04 implementation . 
Visit 3: The morning of Visit 3 (Day -4), hypogonadal men meeting the inclusion criteria and 
none of the exclusion criteria will be confined for approximately 26 hours in the clinic for BP 
assessments by ABPM. In the morning , about 2 hours  prior to start of the ABPM , sites will 
measure each subject’s vital signs (oral temperature, Clinic BP and PR) , with the subject seated  
at rest with back support for at least 10 minutes  prior to vital sign mea surement . Following this 
measurement , subjects will be started on the 24 -hour ABPM portion  of the study , starting at 
7:00 AM. During the 24 -hour ABPM portion  of the study , the site  will provide the subject with a 
meal, and then affix a validated, 510(k)  cleared,  portable ABPM  device to the subject’s arm; the 
device will record the subject’s BP and PR over 24 -hours.  At the end of confinement period , 
sites will upload the ABPM data from the device to the web upload , and a central reader will 
evaluate if a subject’s ABPM data ar e valid based on the ABPM Data Criteria provided in 
Section  Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring .  Subjects with valid recorded ABPM data will 
proceed to Visit 4; subjects who do not have valid ABPM data may choose to repeat Visit 3  or 
they will not be enrolled into the study .  Further, subjects will be asked if they are able to tolerate 
the ABPM component of the study  and if they are willing to complete another 24 hour ABPM  
visit.

morning (6 – 10 AM) of Visit 4 (Day 1 of treatment), eligible subjects will return to the clinic, 
where staff wi ll dispense study drug.   
Investigation Drug Product Resupply ( Day 60; Window Day 30 to Day 60 ): subjects will return 
to the clinic  for a resupply of study drug.   Sites will record the day of the study drug resupply, 
and batch number of the study drug prov ided to the subject.  
MRI -2 (Window: any time between Day 56  and Day 76 , inclusive ): The MRI -2 interim MRI -
PDFF measurement will be performed between Visit 4 and Visit 5 in subjects who had a baseline 
MRI -PDFF measurement (MRI -1).  Sites will schedule MRI -2 at the same local MRI facility that 
performed the subject’s MRI -1. 
Visit 5: The Visit 5 (Day 107, window ± 7 days) schedule involves collecting a blood sample, 
providing meals to subject s, dosing the study medication and ABPM measurements.  
The visit starts on Day 106 with confinement lasting for up to 45 hours. Subjects will enter the 
clinic on Day 106 after taking their study medication in the morning. The site will collect a  
single blood sample from the subjects  (at approximately 3 hours p ost-morning  dose on Day 106). 
Following the blood sample collection, subjects will remain at the site until completion of 
ABPM  on Day 108 (on site duration: ~45 hours) . For subjects who are not able to remain in the 
site for the 45-hour duration, blood sam ple may be collected at approximately 3 hours after the 
evening dose  of Day 106 (on site duration  at least 33 hours) .  
On the morning of Day 107 prior  to start of the ABPM , vital signs ( oral temperature, Clinic BP 
and PR) will be measured when seated at rest with back support for 10 minutes.  Subjects will 
then be provided with the study medication approximately 30 minutes after a meal.  Following 
the administration of study drug , subjects will be started on the 2 4-hour ABPM portion  of the 
study , starting at 7:00 AM . For the 24 -hour ABPM portion  of the study , the site will  affix a 
validated, 510(k)  cleared  portable ABPM device to the subject’s arm; the device will record the 
subject’s BP and PR over 24 -hours. Durin g the ABPM confinement visit, the subjects will be 
administered study drug every 12 hours with meal ( evening of Day 106, morning and evening of 
Day 107, morning of Day 108 prior to exiting site) . Following the 24 -hour ABPM period, 
subjects will exit the cl inic.  All s ubjects will be instructed to continue taking their study 
medication.  Subjects with valid recorded ABPM data  at Visit 5  will proceed to Visit 6 for exit 
procedures  after completing the MRI -2 measurement described below ; subjects who do not hav e 
valid ABPM data may choose to repeat Visit 5. 
MRI -3 (Window: any time between Visit 5 and Visit 6): Following the second ABPM 
measurement at Visit 5, subjects who had a baseline MRI -PDFF measurement  (MRI -1) will have 
a post-treatment  MRI -PDFF  (MRI -3).  Sites will schedule MRI -3 at the same local MRI facility 
that performed the subject’s MRI -1. 
Visit 6: The Visit 6 (Day 1 10, window ± 10 days) schedule involves  exit procedures, including 
return of study medication, vital signs measurement (oral temperat ure, Clinic BP and PR), a

LPCN 1021 (TU) is an oral capsule developed for use in the proposed indication of replacement 
therapy in males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous T due to 
primary or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.  
Testosterone is an endog enous androgen that is responsible for normal growth and development 
of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex characteristics. Testosterone has 
effects that include the growth and maturation of the prostate, seminal vesicles, penis, and 
scrotum; the development of male hair distribution, such as facial, pubic, chest, and axillary hair; 
laryngeal enlargement; vocal cord thickening; alterations in body musculature; and fat 
distribution. Dihydrotestosterone is another androgen endogenously p roduced in the body. 
Testosterone and DHT are necessary for the normal development of secondary sex 
characteristics.  
The Endocrine Society defines hypogonadism in men as “a clinical syndrome that results from 
failure of the testis to produce physiological levels of T (androgen deficiency) and a normal 
number of spermatozoa due to disruption of one or more levels of the hypothalamic pituitary -
testicular axis.”1  Male hypogonadism, a clinical syndrome resulting from insufficient secretion 
of T, has two main e tiologies. Primary hypogonadism is caused by defects of the gonads, such as 
Klinefelter's Syndrome or Leydig cell aplasia, whereas secondary hypogonadism is the failure of 
the hypothalamus (or pituitary) to produce sufficient gonadotropins (i.e., follicle stimulating 
hormone [FSH] and luteinizing hormone [LH]).  The 2010 Endocrine Society guidelines 
recommends replacement therapy for symptomatic men with androgen deficiency to induce and 
maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve bone mineral dens ity, sexual function, 
sense of well -being, and muscle mass and strength . 
There are various routes of T preparation administration available in the US. Each of the routes 
of delivery and formulations are approved to provide T replacement therapy, although e ach has 
unique pharmacokinetic properties, limitations, risks, and safety concerns.  
Oral administration of native T generally results in low bioavailability as it is extensively 
metabolized through pre -systemic first -pass metabolism.2  The only oral produc t currently used 
is a 17--alkyl androgens (methyl testosterone), and this product has been associated with 
serious hepatic adverse effects including life-threatening or fatal complication s.  
To date, there is no FDA approved oral T replacement therapy pro duct that is not 17 --alkylated. 
Availability of an oral product may  confer benefits over existing T replacement products

application site reactions or need for  self-injections/doct or’s office visit for injections, and an 
improved safety profile  compared with 17--alkylated androgens .3 
LPCN 1021 is an oral capsule product 112.5 mg of TU employing a proprietary formulation 
composed of lipids. LPCN 1021 oral product is designed to enable absorption of TU via the 
intestinal lymphatic pathway. Testosterone undecanoate, is a straight chain fa tty acid ester of T, 
which is not alkylated at the 17 -alpha position. Testosterone undecanoate is converted to T by 
non-specific esterases that are abundantly present in the body. Currently, TU is available as an 
injectable product in the US (brand name, A veed®). Oral  TU is not available in the US, but has 
been marketed for more than  20 years outside of the US and is available in more than  80 
countries, including Canada ( as Andriol), for the treatment of male hypogonadism .4  
The LPCN 1021 clinical developme nt program included eight Phase 1 studies and three Phase 3 
studies .  In previous clinical studies (Study LPCN 1021 -05-001 and Study LPCN 1021 -09-001), 
various oral TU formulations were evaluated. All formulations increased T concentrations in 
postmenopaus al female and hypogonadal male subjects. Two formulations (07 and 10) were 
further evaluated in a single ascending dose study in hypogonadal males ( Study S361.1.001 ). 
Single doses administered ranged from 75 mg to 225 mg, and all doses for both formulation s 
achieved T Cmax values at or slightly above the eug onadal range . In a multiple ascending dose 
study (Study M12 -778), LPCN 1021  was administered at doses ranging from 75 to 300 mg as a 
single dose on Day 1 and twice daily  from Day 2 to  14 or 28 days with a normal -fat diet.  
Effect  of food  and food-fat content  were  evaluated  on LPCN  1021 product  in a clinical  study  
LPCN 1021 -14-001.  Food  affects  the rate and extent  of TU absorption from  the LPCN  1021 
drug product  with higher  absorption occurring  when  the product  is taken  with food compared  to 
fasting.  However, s ystemic  exposure  of T following  administration of LPCN  1021 with  varying  
fat contents  was evaluated  and the data demonstrated  that there  was no significant  influence  of 
varying fat content  on T levels.   
The Phase 3 Study LPCN 1021 -13-001 provides safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic for a 
titrated dose  of LPCN 1021 as a T replacement therapy in men with primary and secondary 
hypogonadism.  Results indicate that a starting  dose of 225  mg BID, with titration to 150 mg or 
300 mg LPCN 1021 based on a pharmacokinetic algorithm, was effective in restoring T levels of 
hypogonadal men to the eugonadal  range when taken with a meal.  
The Phase 3 Study LPCN 1021 -16-002 provides safety , efficacy, and pharmacokinetic data for a 
fixed dose of LPCN 1021 as a T replacement therapy in men with primary and secondary 
hypogonadism.  R esults indicate that a twice daily fixed dose of 225 mg  taken with a meal  is

assess subject’s post-treatment  BP and PR via ABPM .  Visit 6 is to perform exit visit procedures.  
There are two confinement visits during the study , one  prior to start of the dosing and another at 
the end of the study.   The study visits are described below.  
Visit 1 & 2: Subjects will undergo a screening period to complete the pre -study examinations and 
to confirm  their hypogonadal status. Serum total testosterone (T)  below 300 ng/dL based on two 
consecutive blood samples obtained between 6 and 10 AM, on two separate days at approximately 
the same time of day, following an appropriate washout of current androgen re placement therapy 
will be used for screening T levels.  At the end of Visit 2 , sites will provide subjects with a 7-day 
sexual desire question printout, with instruction s to answer the question each day for 7 days leading 
up to Visit 3.  Sites will remind subjects to complete the  sexual desire question  printout when 
scheduling Visit 3 for elig ible subjects; ineligible subjects will be informed that they will not be 
able to participate  in the study, and they do not need complete the printout.  
MRI -1 (Window: between Visit 2 and Visit  4): The MRI -1 baseline MRI -PDFF measurement 
will be performed between Visit 2 and Visit 4 in a subset of study subjects (approximately 20 or 
more subjects).  Following confirmation of a subject’s hypogonadal status at Visit 2, sit es will 
schedule MRI -1 at a local MRI facility for the subject.  A local MRI facility capable of 
performing the MRI -PDFF test will be pre -identified by the Med pace Core Lab within the 
geographic location of the site.  Alternatively, if the site has a prefe rred MRI facility, the site can 
use their preferred facility following confirmation by the Med pace Core Lab.  
MRI -1 will be performed for all subjects reaching Visit 4 after implementation of Protocol 
Version 04 until target enrollment is reached.  MRI -1 will not be performed for subjects who 
have already progressed past Visit 4  at the time of Version 04 implementation .   
Visit 3: The morning of  Visit 3 (Day -4), hypogonadal men meeting the inclusion criteria and none 
of the exclusion criteria will be confined for approximately 26 hours in the clinic for BP 
assessments by ABPM.  Upon clinic entry, sites will collect the 7-day sexual desire question 
printout from subjects and give subjects a s exual distress question printout  to answer .  About 2 
hours  prior to start of the ABPM , vital sign measurements w ill be recorded to include oral 
temperature, Clinic BP  PR. For proper measurement of Clinic BP  and PR , the following 
procedures should be follow ed: 
• An appropriately sized cuff for the size of the subject’s arm circumference should be 
utilized to minimize inaccurate readings.   
• No smoking or exercise for at least 30 minutes before a blood pressure measurement  
• Subjects should sit in a chair with a b ack support and the arm supported at heart level 
with feet flat on the floor. The subject should void prior to the measurement.  
• Blood pressure and PR will be measured in triplicate over a minimum of approximately 
10 minutes after the subject has rested in a sitting position for at least 10 minutes.   The 
three  measurements will each be recorded in the CRF and a mean value for that visit will 
be calculated.

starting  at 7:00 AM . During the 24 -hour ABPM portion  of the study , the site will provide the 
subject with a meal, and then  affix a validated, 510(k)  cleared  portable ABPM device to the 
subject’s arm; the device will record the subject’s BP and PR  over 24 -hours .  Sites will set the 
ABPM device to record BP and PR every 15 minutes during daytime hours (7 AM to 11 PM), 
and every 20 minutes during nighttime hours (11 PM to 7 AM).  At the end of confinement 
period, sites will upload the ABPM data from the device to the web upload , and a central reader 
will evaluate if a subject’s ABPM data are valid based on the ABPM Data Criteria provided in 
Section  Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring .  Subjects with valid ABPM data will proceed to 
Visit 4; subjects w ho do not have valid ABPM data may choose to repeat Visit  3 or they will not 
be enrolled into the study .  Subjects will be asked if they were  able to tolerate the ABPM 
component of the study  and if they are willing to participate in the ABPM visit at the e nd of the 
study.  
Visit 4: Subjects with valid ABPM data will return to the clinic for study enrollment.  The 
morning (6 – 10 AM) of Visit 4 (Day 1 of treatment), eligible subjects will return to the clinic , 
where staff  will dispense study drug.  At the end of the visit, sites will provide subjects with a 7-
day sexual desire question printout, with instruction s to answer the question each day for 7 days 
leading up to Visit 5.  Sites will contact subjects 7 days in advanc e of Visit 5 to remind subjects 
to complete  the sexual desire question  printout.  
Investigation Drug Product Resupply (Day 60; Window Day 30 to Day 60) : subjects will return 
to the clinic for a resupply of study drug.   Sites will record the day of the study  drug resupply, 
and batch number of the study drug provided to the subject.  
MRI -2 (Window: any time between Day 56 to Day 76 , inclusive ): The MRI -2 interim MRI -
PDFF measurement will be performed between Visit 4 and Visit 5 in subjects who had a baseline 
MRI-PDFF measurement (MRI -1).  Sites will schedule MRI -2 at the same local MRI facility that 
performed the subject’s MRI -1. 
The Visit 5 (Day 107, window ± 7 days) schedule involves collecting a blood sample, providing 
meals to subject, dosing the study medication and ABPM measurements.  
The visit starts on Day 106 with confinement lasting for up to 45 hours. Subjects will enter the 
clinic on Day 106 after taki ng their study medication in the morning. The site will collect a 
single blood sample from the subjects (at approximately 3 hours post -morning dose on Day 106). 
Following the blood sample collection, subjects will remain at the site until completion of 
ABP M on Day 108 (confinement duration  of about 45 hours). For subjects who are not able to 
remain in the site for the 45 -hour duration, blood sample may be collected at approximately 3 
hours after the evening dose of Day 106 (confinement duration of at least 33 hours).  
Sites will collect the 7-day sexual desire question printout from subjects and give subjects a 
sexual distress question printout  to answer . Then, o n the morning of Day 107, prior to start of the 
ABPM , vital signs ( oral temperature, Clinic BP and PR) will be measured.  Subjects will then be 
provided with the study medication approximately 30 minutes after a meal.  Following th e

starting at 7:00 AM . During the 24 -hour ABPM portion  of the study , the site will affix a valid, 
510(k)  cleared  portable ABPM device to the subject’s arm; the device will record the subject’s 
BP and PR over 24 -hours.  Sites will set the ABPM device to  record BP and PR every 15 
minutes during daytime hours (7 AM to 11 PM), and every 20 minutes during nighttime hours 
(11 PM to 7 AM).  During the ABPM confinement visit, the subjects will be administered study 
drug every 12 hours with a meal (evening of Da y 106, morning and evening of Day 107, 
morning of Day 108 prior to exiting site).  Following the 24 -hour ABPM portion of the study, the 
subjects will exit the clinic . All subjects will be instructed to continue taking their study 
medication.  Subjects with valid recorded ABPM data at Visit 5 will proceed to Visit 6 for exit 
procedures after completing the MRI -2 measurement described below; subjects who do not have 
valid ABPM data may choose to repeat Visit 5.  
MRI -3 (Window: between Visit 5 and Visit 6): Following the second ABPM measurement at 
Visit 5, subjects who had the MRI -1 baseline MRI -PDFF will have a post -treatment MRI -PDFF, 
MRI -3.  Sites will schedule MRI -3 at the same local MRI facility that performed the subject’s 
MRI -1.  
Visit 6: The Visit 6 (Day 110, window ± 10 days) schedule involves  exit procedures  including 
weight measurement, physical exam, vital signs, return of study medication, a blood sample for  
clinical laboratory tests,  review of concomitant medication, AE reporting, and a review of the 
subject ’s Medical History, including specific querying if the subject has a history of diabetes, 
hypertension (never diagnosed, diagnosed but treated, diagnosed  but not treated), and the 
subject’s smoking status (never smoked, former smoker,  current smoker) to ensure that this 
information is included in the subject’s Medical History.  Sites will collect the blood sample for 
clinical laboratory tests  in the mornin g prior to meals ; the subject will not take study drug the 
morning of Visit 6 .   
The total duration of the study will be approximately  110 days not including the screening 
period.

Date: 19 February 2019  Confidential  Page 25 of 50 13.1. Screening Procedures  (Visits 1 and 2)  
Screening procedures will be performed within approximately 60 days preceding study drug 
administration . Subjects must provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any 
screening procedures. The consent to perform some general screening procedures may be 
obtained on a consent document other than the Informed Consent Form (ICF) specific to the 
study. The study -specific ICF must be signed and dated by the subject before participation to 
study -specific procedures.  
Screening procedures will be conducted over two scheduled visits : Visit 1 and Visit 2. Visit 1 
screening procedures will include: informed consent, demographic data, medical and medication 
histories, physical examination  and the first screening testosterone sample.  
In Visit  2, sites will perform sampling for additional laboratory analysis includ ing a second 
screening testosterone sample, electrocardiogram,  a blood sample for clinical laboratory tests , 
and drug and alcohol  screen.  At the end of the visit, sites will provide subjects with a 7-day 
sexual desire question printout, with instruction s to answer the question each day for 7 days 
leading up to Visit 3  (sites will collect at Visit 3).   Sites will remind subjects to complete the 
sexual desire question printout when scheduling Visit 3 for eligible subjects; ineligible subjects 
will be inform ed that they will not be able to participate  in the study, and they do not need 
complete the printout.  
13.2. MRI -1 (Window: between Visit 2 and Visit  4) 
The MRI -1 baseline MRI -PDFF meas urement will be performed between Visit 2 and Visit 4 in a 
subset of study su bjects (approximately 20 or more subjects).  Following confirmation of a 
subject’s hypogonadal status at Visit 2, sites will schedule MRI -1 at a local MRI facility for the 
subject.  A local MRI facility capable of performing the MRI -PDFF test will be pre -identified by 
the Med pace Core Lab within the geographic location of the site.  Alternatively, if the site has a 
preferred MRI facility, the site can use their preferred facility following confirmation by the 
Medpace Core Lab.  
MRI -1 will be performed for al l subjects reaching Visit 4 after implementation of Protocol 
Version 04 until target enrollment is reached .  MRI -1 will not be performed for subjects who 
have already progressed past Visit 4  at the time of Version 04 implementation .   
13.3. Baseline ABPM  (Visit 3) 
Hypogonadal men meeting the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be return 
to the clinic  on the morning of Day -4 (±2) for a confinement visit of approximately 26 hours.  
During this confinement visit, subjec ts will have their  BP measured by ABPM  for 24 hours  
starting at 7:00 AM .  Upon clinic entry, sites will collect the 7-day sexual desire question  
printout  from subjects and give  subjects a sexual distress question printout .  In the morning, prior 
to start of the ABPM , vital signs ( oral temperature, Clinic BP and PR) will be measured. 
Following this  measurement , subjects will be started on the 24 -hour ABPM portion  of the study

510(k ) cleared portable ABPM device to the arm of the subject, and the device will record BP 
and PR  for 24 -hours .  At the end of confinement period, sites will upload the ABPM data from 
the device to the web upload , and a central reader will evaluate if subjects  had valid ABPM 
results. For the 24 -hour ABPM results  to qualify as valid , the data must meet ABPM Data 
Criteria provided in Section Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring . 
Subjects with valid 24-hour ABPM results  proceed to study enrollment (Visit 4).  Subjects who 
do not  have valid ABPM data based on the ABPM criteria can choose to repeat Visit 3  or they 
will not be enrolled into the study . Subject will be asked by the clinic staff if the subject was able 
to tolerate the ABPM component of the study  and if they are able to participate in the ABPM 
visit at the end of the study.  
13.4. Treatment Phase  (Visit 4 through Vi sit 6) 
Treatment Phase of t he study consists of approximately 107 days starting at Visit 4 and ending at 
Visit 5. 
Visit 4: Sites will enroll subjects with valid 24-hour ABPM data from Visit 3 into the study.  The 
morning of  study Visit 4 (Day 1 of treatmen t), eligible subjects will return to the clinic.  Sites 
will dispense study drug, review the concomitant  medications of the subject, review any AEs.  
Sites will instruct subjects to take LPCN 1021 225 mg twice daily, with a meal (approximately 
30 minutes f ollowing meal), for 107 days ( ± 7 days).  Sites will schedule s ubjects for the 
confinement visit (Visit 5, starting on Day 106).  At the end of the visit , sites will provide 
subjects with a 7-day sexual desire question printout, with instruction s to answer the question 
each day for 7 days leading up to Visit 5.  Sites will contact subjects 7 days in advance of Visit 5 
to remind them to answer the question  as instructed . 
Investigation Drug Product Resupply (Day 60; Window Day 30 to Day 60) : subject s will return 
to the clinic for a resupply of study drug.   Sites will record the day of the study drug resupply, 
and batch number of the study drug provided to the subject.  
MRI -2 (Window: any time between Day 56 to Day 76 , inclusive ): The MRI -2 interim MRI -
PDFF measurement will be performed between Visit 4 and Visit 5 in subjects who had a baseline 
MRI -PDFF measurement (MRI -1).  Sites will schedule MRI -2 at the same local MRI facility that 
performed the subject’s MRI -1. 
The Visit 5 (Day 107, window ± 7 days) schedule involves collecting a blood sample, providing 
meals to subject, dosing the study medication and ABPM measurements.  
The visit starts on Day 106 with confinement lasting for up to 45 hours. Subjects will enter the 
clinic on Day 106 after taking th eir study medication in the morning. The site will collect a 
single blood sample from the subjects (at approximately 3 hours post -morning dose on Day 106).

evening dose of Day 106 (on site duration at least 33 hours) . 
Sites will c ollect the 7-day sexual desire question printout from the subjects, and the subjects will 
be given  a question to assess their sexual distress.  On the morning of Day 107, prior to start of 
the ABPM , vital signs ( oral temperature, Clinic BP and PR) will be measured. Subjects will then 
be provided with the study medication approximately 30 minutes after a meal.  Following the 
administration of study drug, subjects will be started on the 24 -hour ABPM portion  of the study  
starting at 7:00 AM.  During the 24 -hour ABPM portion  of the study , the site will affix a valid, 
510(k)  cleared portable ABPM device to the subject’s arm; the device will record the subject’s 
BP and PR over 24 -hours.  During the ABPM confinement visit, the subjects will be admi nistered 
study drug every 12 hours with meal (evening of Day 106, morning and evening of Day 107, 
morning of Day 108 prior to exiting site) . At the end of 24 -hours, subjects will exit the clinic.   
Clinic staff will return study medication to the subject an d instruct  the subject  to continue taking 
their study medication  until Visit 6 .  Subjects with valid recorded ABPM data at Visit 5 will 
proceed to Visit 6 for exit procedures  after completing the MRI -2 measurement described below ; 
subjects who do not have valid ABPM data may choose to repeat Visit 5.  
MRI -3 (Window: between Visit 5 and Visit 6): Following the second ABPM measurement at 
Visit 5, subjects who had the MRI -1 baseline MRI -PDFF will have a post-treatment  MRI -PDFF , 
MRI -3.  Sites will schedule a MRI -PDFF measurement at the same local MRI facility tha t 
performed the baseline MRI -PDFF.   
Visit 6: The Visit 6 (Day 110, window ± 10 days) schedule involves  exit procedures  including  
weight measurement, physical exam, vital signs, return of study medication, a blood sample for 
clinical laboratory  tests,  review of concomitant medication, AE reporting, and a review of the 
subject’s Medical History, including specific querying if the subject has a history of diabetes, 
hypertension (nev er diagnosed, diagnosed but treated, diagnosed but not treated), and the 
subject’s smoking status (never smoked, former smoker,  current smoker) to ensure that this 
information is included in the subject’s Medical History. Sites will collect the blood sampl e for 
clinical laboratory  tests in the morning prior to meals ; the subject will not take study drug the 
morning of Visit 6.  
13.5. Clinical Procedures  
The following sections help define the requirements of medical / clinical information to be 
obtained as a part o f the study.  
13.5.1.1.  Medical and Medication History  
The subject’s medical history (key events) during the past 5 years will be obtained and recorded 
on the Medical History Electronic  Case Report Form (eCRF). Any new information / changes 
should be document ed durin g the study. If a clinical event concerns a chronic disorder, which 
means it started in the past and it is still present at the screening visit, it should also be recorded 
on the Medical History eCRF.

acceptable methods of birth control include the following methods: abstinence, barrier methods, 
hormonal contraception, intrauterine devices, fallopian tube occlusion devices, and sterilization 
either of the male or female partner .  
Medication use (prescr iption or over -the-counter, including vitamins and herbal supplements)  
from 3 months prior to study drug administration through the end of the study will be recorded in 
the eCRF .  If a subject reports taking any over -the-counter or prescription medications , vitamins 
and/or herbal supplement or if administration becomes necessary from 3 months prior to study 
drug administration through the end of the study, the name of the medication, dosage information 
including dose , route,  frequency, date(s) of administra tion including start and end dates, and 
reason for use must be recorded.    
Subjects participating in the trial should be naive  to androgen replacement or has discontinued 
current therapy and completed an adequate washout. Recommended a dequate washout is 
12 weeks following intramuscular androgen injections; 4 weeks following topical or buccal 
androgens; 3  weeks following oral androgens, or, in the judgement of the investigator, the 
subject has had an adequate washout window to be eligible . 
Subjects with a chronic condition requiring medication must : 
• Be under stable treatment , with the same medication and dosage for at least 3 months 
prior to first dosing .  
• Have  no expected change to medication planned throughout the study . 
• The subject’s medication should have  no interaction with the pharmacokinetics of the 
study drug or the bioanalytical methods . 
Concomitant  Medication for Hypertension  
Given that the objective of this study is to assess changes in blood pressure after LPCN  1021 
treatment, sites should  document the medical and medication history associated with 
hypertension. Subjects should be queried  on medication for hypertension, start date, current 
medication, last change in medication prior to the start of the study. During the study, changes in 
hypertensive medication should be driven only by the requirement due to change in hypertensive 
status. Any such changes should be documented with a reason for change.  
Any addition of medication should be document ed including the indication for which the 
medi cation was added. This will be coded per WhoDrug dictionary.  
13.5.1.2.  Electrocardiogram

A physical examination will be performed at screening and exit.  The examination will include at 
minimum an examination of head/eyes/ears/nose/throat . Any changes during the study will be 
documented. Subject's height and weight will be used to calculate BMI .  
13.5.1.4.  Vital Signs  
Sites will measure oral temperature  (single measurement) , and Clinic BP and PR  on Visit 3, 
Visit  5, and at Visit 6/study exit . Vital signs must be measured after the subject has been sitting at 
rest for at  least 10 minutes  with a back support, using automated digital blood pressure devices  
(the device used should be current with respect to calibration, the exact make and model of the 
device used t o record blood pressure should be documented) .  The average of the three BP and PR 
measurements will be used in statistical analyses.  
13.5.1.5.  Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring  
Sites will measure subject ABP M on Visit 3 and Visit 5.  Sites will affix a validated, 510(k)  
cleared portable ABPM device to the arm of the subject, and the device will record BP and PR.  
Sites will set the ABPM device to record  BP and PR every 15 minutes during daytime hours (7 
AM to 11 PM), and every 20 minutes dur ing nighttime hours (11 PM to 7 AM).  At the end of 
24-hours, sites will evaluate if subjects had valid ABPM results. Site staff will be trained in the 
usage of the d evice. At the end of the 24 -hour measurements, sites will upload the data to a 
central web upload tool. A central reader of the data will qualify the data as valid or not. If data 
are not valid  at Visit 3 or Visit 5 , a repeat measurement may be allowed  at the discretion of study 
medical monitor.  For the 24 -hour ABPM results to qualify as valid , the data must meet the 
following ABPM Data Criteria:

13.5.1.10.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging -Proton Density Fat Fraction (MRI -PDFF)  
A MRI -PDFF  measurement will be performed  at baseline between Visit 2 and Visit 4  (MRI -1), 
at an interim point between Day 56 and Day 76, inclusive , (MRI -2) and post-treatment between 
Visit  5 and Visit 6  (MRI -3). MRI -1 will be performed for all subjects reaching Visit 4 after 
implementation of Protocol Version 04 until target enrollment is reach ed (approximately 20 or 
more subjects).   MRI -1 will not be performed for subjects who have already progressed past 
Visit 4 at the time of Version 04 implementation .  The MRI -2 and MRI -3 measurement s will be 
performed for all subjects who complete MRI -1. 
13.6. DOSAGE ADMINISTRATION  
All subjects will receive 225 mg BID (two capsules of 112.5 mg) taken twice daily (total daily 
dose of 450 mg taken as 225 mg in the morning and 225 mg in the evening ), approximately 12 
hours apart, approximately 30 minutes after morni ng and evening meals, with water .    
13.7. Subject Discontinuation  
All the subjects are free to withdraw from the study at any time; additionally, s ubjects may be 
withdrawn  from the study at the discretion of the investigator if they meet any of the following 
criteria : 
• Any event, in the judgment of the investigator, where continuation of the subject in the 
trial could put the subject at health risk.  
• Significant noncompliance with the protocol requirements.  
• Lost to follow -up. 
Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be  replaced . In the event that a subject withdraws 
or is discontinued from the study, the reason(s) for  the discontinuation from the study will be 
recorded and the study exit evaluation should be performed.  For consent withdrawn subjects, 
sites should query the specific reason for withdrawal and document it. For subjects who are lost 
to follow -up sites should make at least three documented attempts to contact the subject prior to 
terminating from study.  If a subject is discontinued from the study with an ongoing AE or an 
unresolved  laboratory result that is significantly outside of the reference range, the investigator 
will attempt to provide follow -up until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the laborator y result  or 
AE is achieved.  
13.7.1.  Exit Evaluation  
Exit evaluation occurs during Visit 6  for subjects who complete the study. For subjects who 
withdraw from the study or discontinued early exit evaluation  should be conducted .

A current (running) and accurate inventory of study drug will be kept by the investigator  and will 
include shipping invoices and the date on which study drug is dispensed to the  subject. An 
overall accountability of the study drug will be performed and verified by  sponsor  monitor 
throughout the study and at the study site closeout visit. Upon completion  or premature 
discontinuation of the study, all original containers (empty or containing  unused study drug) will 
be returned to sponsor (or a designee) , according to instructions from sponsor  and according to 
local regulations. Labels must remain attached to t he containers.  
13.10.  MISSED DOSE 
Subjects who miss a dose and recall the missed dose within 4 hours of their usual dose time 
should take their dose with a meal.  If more than 4 hours have elapsed after their usual dosing 
time, they should skip that dose and resu me their normal schedule with the following dose.  
14.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a 
routine basis throughout the study. The investigator will assess and record  any AE in detail 
includ ing the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or  sign/symptom, severity, time course, 
duration, outcome, relationship of the AE to study drug, and any action(s) taken. For serious AEs 
not considered  "related" to study drug, the investigator will provid e an “Other ” cause of the 
event.  For AEs to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and  severity. 
Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by site personnel, or  reported 
spontaneously by the subject will be recorded . All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory 
resolution . 
14.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical  investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not  necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore  be any unfavorable and unintended sign,  
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational)  product, 
whether or not the event is considered causally rel ated to the use of the product.  
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as  well as 
from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal. Any  worsening of a 
pre-existing condition or illnes s is considered an AE. Worsening in severity of a reported AE 
should be reported as a new AE. Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are AEs 
only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic  medical intervention, 
and/or if the investigator considers them to be AEs.

If an AE meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to the sponsor/PI  as an SAE  
within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE : 
Event  Description of Event  
Death of Subject  An event that results in the death of a subject.  
Life-Threatening  An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would  have resulted in 
immediate fatality if medical intervention  had not been taken. This does not 
include an event that  would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe  
form.  
 
Hospitalization or  
Prolongation of  
Hospitalization   An event that results in an admission to the hospital for  any length of time or 
prolongs the subject's hosp ital stay.  This does not include an emergency room 
visit or  admission to an outpatient facility.  
 
Congenital Anomaly  An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that  results in fetal loss in 
the female partner of a study subject.  
 
Persistent or 
Significant  
Disability/Incapacity  An event that results in a condition that substantially  interferes with the 
activities of daily living of a study  subject. Disability is not intended to include 
experiences  of relatively minor medical signifi cance such as headache,  nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental  trauma (e .g., sprained ankle).  
 
Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
Outcome  An important medical event that may not be immediat ely life -threatening or 
result in death or hospitalization, but based on medical judgment may jeopardize 
the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of 
the outcomes listed above (i .e., death of subject, life -threatening, hos pitalization, 
prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity). Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or  convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
For SAEs with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF.   
14.3. Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each AE: 
Mild  The AE is transient and easily tolerated by the subject.  
Moderate  The AE causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual 
activities . 
Severe  The AE causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities 
and may be incapacitating or life -threatening .

Date: 19 February 2019  Confidential  Page 37 of 50 14.4. Relationship to Study Drug  
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use 
of study dru g: 
Related  An AE where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
study drug and the AE . 
Not Related  An AE where there is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
study drug and the AE . 
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being  related  to 
the study drug will be  considered “related”. Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility 
of being  related  to study drug  will be considered  “not related”. If an investigator's opinion of no 
reasonable possibility of being related  to study drug is given,  an “other” cause of event must be 
provided by the investigator for the SAE . 
14.5. Adverse Event Collection Period  
All AEs in the  subject and pregnancies that occur in subject’s partner reported from the time of 
informed consent  until completion of the last visit  after the last dose of study drug  will be 
collected,  whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject.  
14.6. Serious  Adverse Event Reporting  
In the event of a n SAE in the subject , whether related to study drug or not, the  investigator will 
notify the sponsor  or representative within 24 hours of the site  being made aware of the SAE .

16.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
The primary endpoint and  associated analyses are described in this section. Details of the 
analyses to be performed will be given in a statistical analysis plan  
16.1. Determinat ion of Sample Size  
The final sample size of 135 was chosen for the study based on the recommendations of FDA. 
This sample size is higher than the originally proposed 75 subject sample size and should meet 
the scientific objective of ruling out a change from baseline of 4.9 mm Hg.  
16.2. Study Populations  
Statistical analyses will be performed on the full analysis set (FAS), and safety set .  
Safety Set (SS):  The safety set includes all subjects who received a dose of study drug . All 
safety analyses will be conducted in the SS.  
Full An alysis Set ( FAS ): The FAS consists of all subjects enrolled into the study with valid 
ABP M data at Visit  3 and Visit 5. All analyses of blood pressure will be conducted in the FAS.  
16.3. Statistical Analysis  
Demographic parameters will be summarized descriptivel y. Treatment -emergent AEs will be 
summarized descriptively for all subjects who were dosed (safety population).  
Descriptive statistics (arithmetic and geometric means, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of 
variation (CV [%]), minimum, maximum, and media n) of Clinic BP and PR  measurements will 
be summarized descriptively for all subjects who were dosed (SS population).  
Descriptive statistics (arithmetic and geometric means, SD, CV [%], min imum, max imum, and 
median) of daytime (7:00 AM to 11:00 PM) , nighttime ( 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM) , and 24 -hour 
ABPM parameters (heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure) from Visit 3 
and Visit  5 will be summarized descriptively for all subjects who were dosed and have valid

In addition , the following analyses  and data presentation will be included : 
• Central tendency analysis and outlier analysis for the 24 -hour average and for the hourly 
average. Outliers will be defin ed in the SAP (i.e., systolic BP exceeding 160 mmHg or a 
change in systolic BP > 20 mmHg, or a diastolic BP exceeding 100 mmHg or a change in 
diastolic BP > 15 mmHg).  
• Graphical display of hourly ABPM averages that include standard deviation bars for both 
systolic BP and diastolic BP at baseline and at endpoint (mid -trial data optional).  
• Cumulative distribution curves of 24 -hour average systolic BP and diastolic BP at 
baseline and at each of the timepoints in which ABPM studies are performed.  
• Forest plots of  daytime, nighttime, and 24 -hour change from baseline with 95% 
confidence interval displays for systolic BP and diastolic BP. 
Sensitivity analyses: 1) the above four sub -bullets grouped for subjects without hypertension, 
with hypertension untreated, and wi th hypertension treated; 2) the above four sub -bullets for 
subjects with/without diabetes mellitus.  
A complete description of the statistical analyses to be performed will be presented in the SAP.  
16.4. Endpoint Analysis  
Details of the analyses to be performed will be described  in detail in the SAP. Study primary 
endpoints are briefly discussed below.   Primar y endpoint analysis will be performed using data 
from all subjects with valid ABPM data at baseline (Visit 3) and post-treatment  (Visit 5).   
The objective of the study is to rule out a clinically meaningful increase in 24-hour average 
systolic BP, as measu red by ABPM.   The primary endpoint is the change from Visit 3 to Visit 5  
of the average 24-hour systolic BP.  If the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the change 
from Visit 3 to Visit 5 in average 24-hour systolic BP  is ≤ 4.9 mm Hg, then the change w ill be 
considered not clinically significant . 
16.5. Other Safety Endpoints  
Other k ey safety endpoints are AEs  and physical examination.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  
(MedDRA). An AE is considered treatment emergent if the event begins or worsens in severity 
after initiation of treatment . The number and percentage of subjects with treatment -emergent 
AEs will be tabulated by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term. A summary of the 
number of  subjects with treatment -emergent AEs will be provided by severity and by 
relationship to study drug. Subjects reporting more  than 1 AE for a given MedDRA preferred 
term will be counted only once  for that term using the most severe incident.  Subjects reporting 
more than 1 type of  event within a SOC will be counted only once for that SOC.  Incidence of 
treatment -emergent AEs, serious treatment -emergent AEs , treatment -emergent AEs resulting in

Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requires that the clinical protocol, any protocol  amendments, the 
Investigator's Brochure, the informed consent and all other f orms of  subject information related 
to the study ( e.g., advertisements used to recruit subjects) and  any other necessary documents be 
reviewed by an IRB. The IRB will review the ethical,  scientific and medical appropriateness of 
the study before it is cond ucted. IRB approval  of the protocol, informed consent and subject 
information and/or advertising, as relevant,  will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug 
shipment to a study site.   Any amendments to the protocol will require IRB approval prior to 
implementation of any  changes made to the study design. The investigator will be required to 
submit, maintain  and archive study essential documents according to International Conference on  
Harmonization (ICH).  
Serious adverse events that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated by local regulations, will be 
reported to both IRB and Regulatory Agencies as required by local regulations. During the 
conduct of the study, the investigator should promptly provide writ ten reports ( e.g., ICH 
Expedited Reports or any additional reports required by local regulations) to the IRB of any 
changes that affect the conduct of the study and/or increase the risk to subjects. Written 
documentation of the submission to the  IRB should  also be provided to sponsor/PI . 
17.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, ICH GCP guidelines, applicable 
regulations and guidelines governing  clinical study conduct and ethical principles that have their 
origin in the Declaration of  Helsinki. Responsibilities of the clinical investigator are specified in 
Appendix B . 
17.3. Subject Information and Consent  
Prior to the initiat ion of any screening or study -specific procedures, the investigator or  his/her 
representative will explain the nature of the study to the subject and answer all  questions 
regarding this study. Each  informed consent will be reviewed, signed and dated by the  subject, 
the person who  administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local  
requirements. A copy of each informed consent will be given to the subject and each  original 
will be placed in the subject's medical record. An entry m ust also be made in the  subject's dated 
source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to  any study -related 
procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.

The investigator/institution will permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB review, and  
regulatory inspection(s), providing direct access to source data documents.  
18.2. Case Report Forms  
Case report forms (CRF) must be completed for each subject who receives study medication  in 
this study. These  forms will be used to transmit information collected during the study to 
sponsor/PI  and regulatory authorities, as applicable. The CRF data for this study will be  collected 
with an electronic data capture  (eEDC ) system. The EDC system and the study -specific eCRFs 
will comply with Title 21 CFR Part 11. The documentation related to the validation of the EDC 
system is available through the system vendor , while the validation of the study -specific eCRFs  
will be conducted by the clinical research organization ( CRO ) and will be maintained in the Trial 
Master File at the CRO.  
The investigator will document subject data in his/her own subject files. These subject  files will 
serve as source data for the study . All eCRF data required by this protocol will  be recorded by 
investigative site personnel in the EDC system. All data entered into the  eCRF will be supported 
by source documentation.   
The investigator or an authorized member of the investigator's staff wi ll make any necessary 
corrections to the eCRF. All change information, including the date and person performing the 
corrections, will be available via the audit trail, which is part of the EDC system. For any 
correction, a reason for the alteration will be  provided. The eCRFs will be reviewed periodically 
for completeness, legibility, and acceptability by CRO personnel (or their representatives). The 
CRO (or their representatives) will  also be allowed  access to all source documents pertinent to 
the study in  order to verify eCRF entries. The  investigator will review the eCRFs for 
completeness and accuracy and provide  his or her electronic signature and date to eCRFs as 
evidence thereof.  
The CRO  will provide access to the EDC system for the duration of the tri al through a  
password -protected method of internet access. Such access will be removed from  investigator 
sites at the end of the site's participation in the study. Data from the EDC  system will be archived 
on appropriate data media ( e.g., CD-ROM) and provi ded to the  investigator at that time as a 
durable record of the site's eCRF data. It will be possible for  the investigator to make paper

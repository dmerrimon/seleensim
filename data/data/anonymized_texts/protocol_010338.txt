   2. SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
EN3835-302 protocol amendments and amended informed consent forms (as necessary) have 
been reviewed and approved by the governing Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) before 
implementation of the amendments at each study center.  
Amendment 3 was incorporated into the protocol on June 5, 2018. The major reasons for this 
amendment are clarification of the use of one of the cellulite assessments, additional subject and 
investigator training requirements, and clarification of the Per Protocol population exclusions.

Populations  Per-Protocol population: The Per -Protocol 
population is defined as those mITT subjects who do not have any major deviations.  Per-Protocol (PP) population: The PP 
population is defined as the mITT subjects without any of the following:  
- Placebo randomized subject who receives EN3835 treatment.  
- EN3835 randomized subject who receives 
placebo treatment only throughout study.  
- Any subject who uses protocol -prohibited 
medications.  
- Subject missing PR -PCSS and/or 
CR-PCSS assessment at Day 71.  
- Subject with a buttock not receiving all three treatment sessions without medical reasons (e.g., adverse events or CR -PCSS 
rated as zero (0)).  
- Subject who did not meet all inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.  
13.1.2  Subject 
and Investigator Assessments  Added text  At each visit prior to the subject assessments 
being completed, subjects will watch an ePRO 
and scale tutorial video and instructions. The 
site will document subject review of the training (video and instructions) in source 
documentation.  
13.1.2.4  Subject 
Satisfaction with Cellulite Treatment 
Assessme nt At the Day 71 visit, subjects will be instructed 
to answer a question related to their treated 
buttocks.  At the Day 71 visit, subjects will be instructed 
to answer a question related to their treated 
buttocks while viewing digital images of their 
butto cks. 
13.1.2.7  
Investigator 
Global Aesthetic 
Improvement 
Scale (I -GAIS)  Added text  Investigators will be trained by Endo or their 
designee on the use of the I -GAIS prior to 
assessing any subjects. At each visit,  the 
Investigator may review the training and use material for the I -GAIS

17.2.4  Per-
Protocol (PP) 
Population  The per -protocol population is defined as the 
mITT subjects without any of the following :  
• Placebo -assigned subject receives 
EN3835 treatment  
• EN3835- assigned subject receives 
placebo treatment only throughout study 
• Any subject receives protocol -prohibited 
medications  
• Subject lacking PR -PCSS and/or 
CR-PCSS assessment at Day 71  
• Any major protocol deviation that is deemed as impact subject efficacy  The PP population is defined as the mITT 
subjects without any of the following :  
• Placebo randomized subject who receives EN3835 treatment.  
• EN3835 randomized subject who 
receives placebo treatment only throughout  study.  
• Any subject who uses protocol -
prohibited medications.  
• Subject missing PR -PCSS and/or 
CR-PCSS assessment at Day 71.  
• Subject with a buttock not receiving all three treatment sessions without medical

• Subject who did not meet all inclusion 
and exclusion criteria.  
Amendment 2 was incorporated into the protocol on January 16, 2018. The major reasons for 
this amendment were revising the primary efficacy variable from at least one buttock to a 
randomly selected target buttock, revising key secondary endpoints, and adding an additional 
efficacy assessment.

Study Design  Added text  Of the two assigned eligible buttocks, one 
buttock will be randomly selected as the target buttock for the pr imary efficacy endpoint. The 
other (remaining) buttock will be considered 
the non- target buttock. Subjects, investigators, 
site personnel, and Endo personnel will be 
blinded to the identification of the target and 
the non -target buttocks.  
At Day 1, the s ubject will complete a Patient 
Reported Cellulite Impact Scale (PR -CIS) 
assessment.  At Day 1, the subject will complete a Patient

Randomization  On Day 1, if each of the buttocks again meet 
the criteria (3 or 4 on the PR -PCSS and CR -
PCSS), the subject will be randomized to a treatment group.  On Day 1, if each of the buttocks (ie, both 
buttocks) again meet the criteria (3 or 4 on 
the PR -PCSS and CR -PCSS), one buttock 
will b e randomly assigned by the IWRS as 
the target buttock for the primary efficacy endpoint. Subjects, investigators, site personnel and Endo personnel will be blinded to the identification of the target buttock.

13.1.2.5 Subject 
Self-Rating Scale 
(SSRS)  Added section  13.1.2.5. Subject Self -Rating Scale (SSRS)  
The SSRS is a measure that assesses subject 
satisfaction with appearance in association with cellulite on the buttocks using whole 
numbers on a 7- level scale that ranges from 0 
(extremely dissatisfied) to 6 (extremely 
satisfied). The patient will be asked to respond to the question related to the satisfaction with appearance of the cellulite on their buttocks on the appropriate visit day (note Day 71 question 
is different than Day 1 question). No 
photographs or reference to previous ratings or evaluations will be used. Subjects will be given a list of responses and they will provide a rating from those below that best represents their answer (Table 7); the list of responses is the same for Day 1 and for Day 71.  
On Day 1 (Baseline), subjects will be 
instructed to answer: Considering your 
appearance in association with your cellulite 
on your buttocks, how satisfied do you feel 
with your appearance at the present time?  
On Day 71, subjects will be instructed to 
answer:  Considering your appearance in 
association with your cellulite on your 
buttoc ks, how satisfied do you feel with your 
appearance at the present time whether or not 
in your judgment it is due entirely to treatment 
with EN3835?

14.6.1 Adverse 
Events of Special Interest  Adverse events such as bruising, ecchymosis, 
hematomas, and contusions that occur remote 
to the site of drug administration, or any hypersensitivity reactions, incl uding 
anaphylaxis, will be recorded as an AE or 
SAE as appropriate (see section 14.1.1, 
Adverse Events or section 14.1.2, Serious 
Adverse Events).  Adverse events such as bruising, ecchymosis, 
hematomas, and contusions that occur remote 
to the site of drug administration, or any hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, will be recorded and evaluated 
for seriousness and severity (see section 
14.1.1, Adverse Events or section 14.1.2, 
Serious Adverse Events).  
In addition, local AEs associated with the  
injection site, including bruising, pain, 
nodules/mass, ulceration, erythema, pruritus, swelling, and/or induration, will be recorded 
and evaluated for seriousness and severity (see 
as appropriate, section 14.1.1, Adverse Events 
or section 14.1.2, Serious  Adverse Events)  
17.1 
Determination of Sample Size  The primary variable is the proportion of 2 -
level composite responders at Day 71 defined 
as subjects with at least one of two treated buttocks with:  
• an improvement in severity from baseline (Day 1 visit) of at least 2 levels of severity in the CR -PCSS as assessed live by the 
Investigator, and  
• an improvement in severity from baseline of at least 2  levels of severity in the 
PR-PCSS as assessed by the subject while 
viewing the digital image of the same butto ck.  
A subject will be considered a responder if 
these criteria are met in either the left buttock 
or right buttock or both buttocks in that subject. In other words, a subject will be considered a responder if she has an improvement of at least 2 levels on  the PR -
PCSS and an improvement of at least 2  levels 
on the CR -PCSS on that same buttock; that 
buttock could be the left buttock or right 
buttock or both buttocks.  The primary variable is the proportion of 2 -
level composite responders at Day 71 defined 
as subjects with:  
• an improvement in severity from baseline 
(Day 1 visit) of at least 2 levels of severity 
in the CR -PCSS as assessed live by the 
Investigator of the target buttock, and   
• an improvement in severity from baseline of at least 2  levels of severity  in the 
PR-PCSS as assessed by the subject while 
viewing the digital image of the target 
buttock.  
A subject will be considered a responder if 
these criteria are met in the randomized target buttock of that subject

digital image of the same buttock.  
A subject will be considered a respo nder if 
these criteria are met in either the left buttock or right buttock or both buttocks in that subject. In other words, a subject will be considered a responder if she has an improvement of at least 2 levels on the PR -
PCSS and an improvement of at least 2  levels 
on the CR -PCSS on that same buttock; that 
buttock could be the left buttock or right 
buttock or both buttocks.  The primary efficacy variable is the proportion 
of 2-level composite responders at Day 71 
defined as subjects with:  
• an improvement in severity from baseline 
(Day 1 visit) of at least 2 levels of severity in the CR -PCSS as assessed live by the 
Investigator of the target buttock, and   
• an improvement in severity from baseline of at least 2  levels of severity in the 
PR-PCSS by the subject w hile viewing the 
digital image of the target buttock.  
A subject will be considered a responder if these criteria are met in the randomized target buttock of that subject.

Scale (PR -CIS)  Added section 13.1.2.3. Patient Reported Cellulite Impact Scale (PR -CIS)  
At the Day 1 visit and Day  71 visit, subjects 
will be instructed to answer 6 questions related to the areas selected for treatment on their buttocks on the Patient Reported Cellulite Impact Scale (Appendix D) while viewing 
digital images of their buttocks. The PR -CIS 
assesses the v isual and emotional impact of 
cellulite (happy, bothered, self -conscious, 
embarrassed, looking older or looking 
overweight or out of shape) using a 6 -question 
survey, with each question rated on a 
numerical rating scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 
(extremely ). 
This variable will be entered directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.

13.1.2.6 Hexsel Cellulite Severity Scale 13.1.2.6. Hexsel Cellulite Severity Scale  
The Hexsel Cellulite Severity Scale (referred to as the Hexsel CSS) is a photonumeric scale that looks at 5 key morphologic features of 
cellulite: (A) number of evident depressions, 
(B) depth of depressions, (C) morphological appearance of skin surface alterations, (D) laxity, flaccidity or sagging of skin, and (E) 
current classification scale based on medical literature including Nürnberger and 
Müller.(12,13) Each of these features is 
evaluated on a 4 -point scale from a low of 0 to 
a high of 3 as described in Table 8. The total  
score is the summation of all 5 features (Appendix D).  
The Investigator or qualified designee will 
independently use the Hexsel CSS to assess 
the severity of EFP in each of the two buttocks at the Screening visit and each of the two buttocks on Day 1 (Not e: In this study, the 
Hexsel CSS is used exclusively for assessment of subject eligibility; it is not used as an 
efficacy assessment). All cellulite assessments Deleted section and table

should be made while the subject is in the 
standing position with relaxed gluteus 
muscles. Howe ver, when evaluating the 
subject for Category E (classification scale by Nürnberger and Müller) (13) if the subject has 
no evident depressions, the subject should be 
asked to contract her gluteus muscles or the pinch test should be applied (by pinching the  
skin between the thumb and index finger) so the Investigator or qualified designee can differentiate between scores/grades of zero (0) 
or I. 
This variable will be entered directly into the

Name of Active Ingredient : Collagenase clostridium histolyticum  
Title of Study : A Phase 3, Randomized, Double- Blind, Pla cebo -Controlled Study of EN3835 in the 
Treatment of Edematous Fibrosclerotic Panniculopathy 
Lead Principal Investigator:  
Study Period :  
Estimated date first subject enrolled:  Feb-2018 
Estimated date last subject completed:  Oct-2018 Phase of Development : 3 
Objectives :  
To assess the efficacy and safety of EN3835 in the treatment of edematous fibrosclerotic panniculopathy 
(EFP), commonly known as cellulite, in adult women  
Study Design: This study is a Phase 3 randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled study of the 
efficacy and safety of EN3835 in the treatment of EFP in adult women. Subjects will be screened for 
study eligibility within 14 days prior to enrolling in this study. Subjects with 2 treatment areas (bilateral 
buttocks) (also referred to as quadrants) with moderate or severe levels of cellulite as independently 
assessed by the subject using the Patient Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (PR -PCSS) 
and by the Investigator using the Clinician Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR -PCSS) 
will be eligible. The eligibility of the buttocks will be confirmed on Day 1.  
Once the eligibility of the buttocks is confirmed, subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment 
group (EN3835 0.84 mg per buttock or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio within an investigational site. Each 
subject will receive a treatment course which consists of up to 3 treatment visits (sessions), separated by 
21 days (ie, Days 1, 22, and 43). Each treatment visit will consist of 12 injections (0.3 mL per injection 
of EN3835 0.07 mg/injection or placebo; 0.84 mg in 3.6 mL per buttock) in each of the two buttocks for 
a total volume of 7.2 mL (1.68 mg). Selection of dimples to be treated in the buttocks will be at the discretion of the Investigator. End of study will occur at study day 71. Of the two assigned eligible 
buttocks, one buttock will be randomly selected as the target buttock for the primary efficacy endpoint. 
The other (remaining) buttock will be considered the non -target buttock. Subjects, investigators, site 
personnel, and Endo personnel will be blinded to the identification of the target and non- target buttocks.  
At each treatment visit, each of the buttocks will be photographed before and after marking dimples and injection sites while the subject is in a consistent, standardized relaxed standing pose. The subject will 
assess the digital photographic image (pre-marking) of each of the buttocks using the PR- PCSS to 
determine the severity of EFP in each of the buttocks. In addition, the subject will evaluate each  of the 
buttocks using a Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (S -GAIS). Subsequently, the Investigator 
will conduct live assessments of each buttock using the CR -PCSS. At Day 1, the subject will complete a 
Patient Reported Cellulite Impact Scale (PR -CIS) assessment and a Subject Self -Rating Scale (SSRS) 
assessment. The subject assessments will always be completed prior to and independently of the 
Investigator assessments at each treatment visit. In addition, the Investigator will assess each of the 
buttocks using an Investigator Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (I -GAIS). All of the assessments 
must be done before the dimple marking. 
At Day 71 (End of Study/Early Termination), photographs of each of the buttocks will be taken and 
evaluated by subject using the PR -PCSS. The Investigator will conduct live assessments of each of the

Analyses:  
Analyses of Primary Endpoint: 
The primary endpoint is the proportion of 2- level composite responders at Day 71 defined as subjects 
with:  
• an improvement in severity from baseline (Day 1 visit) of at least 2 levels of s everity in the 
CR-PCSS as assessed live by the Investigator of the target buttock, and 
• an improvement in severity from baseline of at least 2  levels of severity in the PR -PCSS as 
assessed by the subject while viewing the digital image of the target buttock . 
A subject will be considered a responder if these criteria are met in the randomized target buttock of that subject.  
The primary endpoint will be summarized as percentages and analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test that compares the 2 treatment groups and adjusts for Investigator at a level of significance of 0.05. The ITT population will be evaluated for the primary endpoint with any subject not having an 
evaluation of CR- PCSS and/or PR- PCSS at Day 71 classified as a non -responder. 
Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint will include: 
• ITT subjects with missing data handled by multiple imputation (MI) approach 
• ITT subjects with missing data handled by a last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
approach  
• mITT subjects with missing data handled by  an LOCF approach  
• Observed data only (no missing data imputed) 
• Per-protocol (PP) subjects with missing data handled by an LOCF approach if 10% or more 
subjects are excluded in the PP population from mITT population.

Name of Active Ingredient : Collagenase clostridium histolyticum  
Analyses of Key Secondary Endpoints :  
There will be 8 key secondary endpoints grouped as three families of 2 to 4 endpoints per family 
analyzed in hierarchical order.  
• Family #1 – four endpoints:  
- Proportion of 1- level PR -PCSS responders defined as subjects with ≥1- level 
improvement in PR-PCSS severity rating of the target buttock at Day 71 compared to Day 1  
- Proportion of 2- level PR -PCSS responders defined as subjects with ≥2- level 
improvement in PR- PCSS severity  rating of target buttock at Day 71 compared to Day 1 
- Proportion of 1- level composite responders of target buttock (defined as subjects with 
an improvement in severity from baseline of at least 1 level of severity in the CR -PCSS 
of the target buttock assessed live by the Investigator and an improvement of severity from baseline of at least 1 level of severity in the PR -PCSS of the target buttock) at 
Day 71 compared to Day 1 
- Proportion of 2- level composite responders of the non -target buttock at Day 71 
compared to Day 1 
• Family #2 – two endpoints: 
- Proportion of 1- level SSRS responders defined as subjects who were at least slightly 
satisfied at Day 71 (SSRS rating ≥ 4)  
- Change from baseline (Day 1) of the PR -CIS total score at Day 71  
• Family #3 – two endpoints: - Proportion of 1- level S -GAIS responders defined as subjects with ≥1- level 
improvement (improved, much improved or very much improved) in the S- GAIS 
assessment of the target buttock at Day 71  
- Proportion of 2- level S -GAIS responders defined as subjects with ≥2-level 
improvement (much improved or very much improved) in the S- GAIS assessment of 
the target buttock at Day 71  
The key secondary efficacy analyses will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary endpoint based 
on the ITT population. The family #1 k ey secondary efficacy analyses will be performed only if the 
primary efficacy analysis is significant at a significance level of p ≤ 0.05 (gatekeeping strategy). 
Similarly, family #2 key secondary efficacy analyses will be performed only if at least one of  the key 
secondary efficacy endpoints of family #1 is significant at a significance level of p  ≤ 0.0125 and 
family  #3 key secondary efficacy analyses will be performed only if at least one of the key secondary 
efficacy endpoints of family #2 is significant (parallel gatekeeping strategy). Within a family of key 
secondary efficacy endpoints, the Bonferroni method will be performed to relocate unused alpha for 
testing each endpoint to assure an overall error rate of p ≤ 0.05. The details of the testing procedures will 
be provided in the statistical analysis plan for the study.

• Proportion of 1- level SSRS responders defined as subjects who were at least slightly 
satisfied at Day 71 (SSRS rating ≥ 4)  
• Proportion of subjects at each level of the subject satisfaction with cellulite treatment 
assessment (Day  71) 
• Proportion of satisfied responders (defined as subjects with a response of at least 1 
(ie, 1-Satisfied or 2 -Very Satisfied) in the subject satisfaction with cellulite treatment 
assessment (Day 71)  
All supportive endpoints will be summarized as percentages. The dichotomous secondary endpoints 
(ie, responder endpoints) will be analyzed using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted for 
Investigator. Changes in the PR -PCSS ratings and CR -PCSS ratings from baselines, S -GAIS scores, and 
I-GAIS scores will be analyzed using the Mann -Whitney test.  
Safety Analysis : 
The foll owing variables are safety endpoints:  
• AEs: Mapped to preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA)  
• Vital signs  
• Clinical laboratory tests  
AEs will be summarized by proportion of subjects reporting each event. The Fisher exact test will be 
used to compare EN3835 to placebo. Descriptive statistics will be presented for actual and change from 
baseline at each visit for vital signs and for each clinical laboratory test parameter. The comparison between treatment groups will be ba sed on the change from baseline for clinical laboratory tests and 
vital signs using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a factor of drug (EN3835 or placebo). 
Immunogenicity : Anti -AUX -I and anti- AUX -II antibody levels will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics for the actual value at the visit. Samples from Day 1, Day 22, Day 43, and Day 71 visits will be 
analyzed for anti -AUX -I and anti- AUX -II antibodies and a subset of Day 1 and Day 71 samples will be 
analyzed for neutralizing antibodies.

   8. INTRODUCTION 
8.1. Background  
8.1.1. Edematous Fibrosclerotic Panniculopathy  
Edematous fibrosclerotic panniculopathy (EFP), commonly known as cellulite, has been defined 
as a local metabolic disorder of subcutaneous tissues that results in a contour abnormality of the skin.(1)  The condition manifests as dimpled skin, particularly in the gluteal- femoral reg ion.(2,3) 
EFP is caused by herniation of subcutaneous fat lobules through the dermohypodermal junction and/or shortening of the collagen septa that cross the hypodermal layer and connects the dermis to the underlying fascia. This creates an uneven surface with dimpling.(1,2 ) EFP is a medical 
condition resulting in a potentially cosmetically unacceptable alteration of the skin, and affects an estimated 85% to 98% of postpubertal women.( 1,3) 
The pathophysiology of EFP is not completely understood, but there are 3 main theories: edema 
resulting from excessive hydrophilia of the intercellular matrix, alteration of the regional 
microcirculation, and different anatomical conformation of collagenous subcutaneous tissues in women versus men.(4)  
It is known that EFP is different from generalized obesity. In generalized obesity, adipocytes undergo hypertrophy and hyperplasia that are not limited to the pelvis, thighs, and abdomen.(1 ) 
In areas of EFP, adipocytes have physiologic and biochemical properties that differ from adipose 
tissue located elsewhere. Large, metabolically -stable adipocytes characterize EFP -prone areas; 
thus, the responsiveness to catecholamine-induced lipolysis is less in EFP tissues compared to 
visceral fat, which has the greatest responsiveness.( 1) 
Subcutaneous fat lobes are separated from one another by thin, usually rigid strands of collagenous connective tissues, which cross the fatty layers and connect the dermis to the underlying fascia. These septa stabilize the subcutis and divide the fat. In EFP, shortening of the 
collagen septa due to fibrosis provokes retraction at the insertion points of the trabeculae, 
causing the depressions that characterize EFP.( 2) There are a higher percentage of thinner, 
perpendicular hypodermal septa in women with EFP than in men.(1)  Weight ga in makes EFP 
more noticeable, but it may be present even in thin subjects. Genetics may also play a role since EFP tends to run in families.  
8.1.2. Current EFP Treatments  
There are therapies that have been utilized in an attempt to treat cellulite; however, there  are no 
approved pharmacologic treatments. Despite multiple therapeutic modalities, there is little scientific evidence that any of these treatments are beneficial. In fact, much of the evidence is anecdotal, subjective, or based only on patient self- asses sment.(5) Some of the historical 
treatments for EFP have included weight loss,(6)  topical agents,(5)  massage, (7) liposuction,(5,6) 
mesotherapy ,(6) radiofrequency,(6)  subcision and powered subcision,(8)  and laser 
therapies ;(9,10) some of these treatments may pose an increased risk for  adverse effects. (5)

   There remains an unmet medical need for safe and effective therapies to improve the aesthetic 
outcome in women with cellulite. To effectively treat cellulite, a therapeutic approach may 
require disruption of the dermal septa, which are composed of collagen and cause the skin 
dimpling that is bothersome to many women. 
8.1.3. EN3835 (Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum) 
Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Endo) is developing EN3835 for the treatment of EFP. Be cause 
EN3835 is a proteinase that can hydrolyze the triple-helical region of collagen under 
physiological conditions, EN3835 has the potential to be effective in lysing subdermal collagen, such as those observed in the dermal septa, which are the underlying cause of the skin dimpling 
in women with EFP. EN3835 targets the collagenase structural matrix (eg, dermal septa) at the 
site of injection and does not require systemic exposure to be effective. 
EN3835 is a parenteral lyophilized product comprised of 2 collagenases in an approximate 1:1 
mass ratio, Collagenase I (AUX -I, Clostridial class I collagenase) and Collagenase II (AUX -II; 
Clostridial class II collagenase). These collagenases are isolated and purified from the 
fermentation of Clostridium histolytic um. 
Collagenase AUX -I is a single polypeptide chain containing approximately 1,000 amino acids of 
known sequence and with a molecular weight of 114 kDa. Collagenase AUX- II is also 
approximately 1,000 amino acids long and has a molecular weight of 113 kDa. These 
2 collagenases are not immunologically cross -reactive and have different specificities, such that 
together they become synergistic, providing a very broad hydrolyzing reactivity toward collagen. 
Clostridial collagenases are proteinases that can hydro lyze the triple -helical region of collagen 
under physiological conditions. 
EN3835 is currently approved (brand name is XIAFLEX
®) for: 1) the treatment of adults with 
Dupuytren’s contracture with a palpable cord and, 2) for the treatment of adult men with 
Peyronie’s disease with a palpable plaque and curvature deformity of at least 30° at the start of 
therapy.  
A recent Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (EN3835-201) of 
375 women randomized to treatment of one treatment area (quadran t) (quadrant was defined in 
study EN3835-201 as a left buttock, a right buttock, a left posterolateal thigh or a right 
posterolateral thigh) of cellulite with EN3835 0.84 mg or placebo in a 1:1 ratio assessed the 
effectiveness and safety of EN3835. Efficac y in this study was evaluated based on cellulite 
assessments using Clinician Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR -PCSS), Patient 
Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (PR -PCSS), Investigator Global Aesthetic 
Improvement Scale (GAIS -I), Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS -S), and 
Subject Satisfaction with Cellulite Treatment.  
Results from the Phase 2b study demonstrated that treatment (3 visits approximately 21 days apart) improved the cellulite severity of the treatment a rea as assessed by the primary endpoint of 
2-level composite responder analyses, the proportion of responders based on an improvement of 
≥2 levels in the appearance of cellulite in both the patient PR -PCSS and the clinician CR -PCSS 
of buttocks and thighs w as statistically significantly greater in subjects who received EN3835 
0.84 mg (10.6%; p <0.001) compared to subjects who received placebo (1.6%); 1- level (or 
greater) responders in the PR-PCSS of EN3835- treated subjects (72.3%) was significantly 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 3 
05-Jun-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 54 
   greater than 1 -level responders in the placebo group (51.6%) ( p<0.001); statistically significant 
(p≤0.001) improvement in the appearance of cellulite based on the subject S -GAIS were 
observed in EN3835 0.84- mg group (73.1%) compared to the placebo group (44.0%); and 62.9% 
of subjects in the EN3835 0.84 mg group were satisfied or very satisfied with the results of their 
cellulite treatment compared with only 35.9% of subjects in the placebo group ( p<0.001). In 
subjects treated in buttocks (n=187), the proportion of 2-level composite responders was statistically significantly greater in subjects who received EN3835 0.84 mg (14.9%; p<0.001) compared to subjects who received placebo (1.1%); 1-level (or greater) responders in the 
PR-PCSS of EN3835- treated subjects (72.7%)  was significantly greater than 1 -level responders 
in the placebo group (47.8%) ( p<0.001). 
The study also demonstrated EN3835 to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events (SAEs) related to EN3835. Safety results from a total of 4 studies (1 pilot, 2 Phase 1, and 2 Phase 2 
studies) in which 435 adult females received subcutaneous injections of EN3835 indicate that the majority of treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are transient, non -serious, mild or 
moderate in intensity, and related to the local administration of EN3835. The immunogenicity profile after 3 treatment visits of EN3835 indicate that greater than 90% of EN3835- treated 
subjects were seropositive for AUX-I and/or AUX-II antibodies; this profile of EN3835 is 
similar to that observed in  the Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease programs. 
A Phase 1, open-label safety and pharmacokinetic study of a single dose of EN3835 0.84 mg in 
11 female subjects with EFP showed that there was no quantifiable levels of AUX- I or AUX -II 
at any ti me point after subcutaneous injection of EN3835 0.84 mg into one quadrant. A second 
Phase 1, open-label safety and pharmacokinetic study of a single dose of EN3835 0.84 mg per treatment area in two treatment areas (buttock -buttock, thigh-thigh, or buttock- thigh) 
concurrently (total dose of 1.68 mg) showed that there was no quantifiable levels of AUX- I or 
AUX- II at any time point post-dose attributable to the injection of EN3835 1.68 mg. 
The results from these studies suggest that subcutaneous injections of EN3835 in the area of 
cellulite may be a well- tolerated and effective medical treatment for adults with EFP.  
8.2. Summary of Nonclinical Studies  
Non-clinical studies necessary to support clinical studies have been performed and are 
summarized in the Investigato r Brochure (IB).(11)  Non -clinical studies in the following areas 
were performed: toxicology, reprotoxicity, genotoxicity, and hypersensitivity. 
8.3. Summary of Known Risks and Benefits  
A summary of safety risks is pro vided in the IB.( 11) The following events have been commonly 
observed: local injection site reactions (injection site bruising, injection site swelling, injection 
site pain) for the various approved indications a s well as those being investigated. In the phase 
2b study of EN3835 in women with EFP, the following treatment related adverse events ≥2% of 189 EN3835- treated women were reported: injection site bruising (75.1%), injection site pain 
(59.3%), injection site nodule (14.3%), injection site pruritus (11.1%), injection site swelling 
(7.4%), injection site induration (5.8%), injection site mass (5.3%), injection site discolouration 
(3.2%), and injection site erythema (2.1%). These events are similar to events re ported in the 
clinical trials of EN3835 for the approved indications. Postmarketing safety data are consistent 
with safety data reported in clinical trials.  

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 3 
05-Jun-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 55 
   Although a thorough benefit of EN3835 has not been fully evaluated in the treatment of EFP, the 
efficacy results from the Phase 2b study and previous EFP studies warranted further 
development. 
8.4. Rationale  
The results from the Phase 2b EFP study (EN3835-201) further suggested that EN3835 0.84 mg per treatment area (quadrant) is an effective treatment of EF P based on improvement in the 
severity of cellulite as determined by the Investigator and the subject. There were no safety concerns following 0.84 mg per treatment area in the treatment of EFP (section 8.1.3). Safety findings from the Phase 2b EFP study are similar to that observed in previous clinical studies 
with EN3835 in the treatment of EFP and XIAFLEX in the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture 
and Peyronie’s disease, in that that the majority of AEs occurred at the site of injection and resolved before the next scheduled treatment. The immunogenicity profile of EN3835 in the 
Phase 2b EFP study is similar in previous studies and programs. 
Based on the efficacy and safety findings from the Phase 2a and 2b EF P studies, the EN3835 
0.84- mg dose per treatment area in two treatment areas (buttocks) warranted further investigation 
in this study.  
Treating two buttocks at each treatment visit will potentially provide a symmetrical- like 
improvement in appearance. Support for evaluation of the treatment of two buttocks concurrently 
is based on: 1) the safety findings from the previous EFP studies are local to the injection site, 
2) the pharmacological activity of EN3835 is local and does not require systemic exposure, and 3) no significant quantifiable systemic concentration has been attributable to injection of two 
buttocks concurrently. 
The integration of dose and use justification supports this study of evaluation of EN3835 
0.84 mg per treatment area in two treatment areas (buttocks) concurrently.

   10. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
10.1. Study Design  
This study will be performed at approximately 25 study centers located in the U nited States. This 
clinical study will be conducted as a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study comparing EN3835 to placebo in adult women with EFP. The study will consist of 71 days 
of double- blind treatment. Subjects meeting the entry criteria for this study will be randomized to 
EN3835 treatment or placebo treatment in a 1:1 ratio within an investigational site.  
The complete Schedule of Events is provided in section 5.

10.2. Selection of Doses  
The dose of EN3835 chosen for this study was based on the results from earlier studies. 
The data from the Phase 2a EFP dose- ranging study (AUX -CC-831) suggest that EN3835 
0.84 mg is most effective in the treatment of EFP based on improvement in the severity of 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 3 
05-Jun-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 58 
   cellulite as determined by both the Investigator and the subject, although the EN3835 0.48- mg 
group did show i mprovement in some of the efficacy parameters.  
• There were no safety concerns following administration of up to 3 treatment visits of 
EN3835 0.84 mg in the treatment of EFP (AUX- CC-831 CSR). The safety profile of 
EN3835 0.84 mg in the treatment of EFP was similar to that observed in the EN3835 0.06-mg group and the EN3835 0.48-mg group. No notable differences were observed across the 3 treatment groups. 
• Safety findings from the Phase 2a EFP dose- ranging study are similar to that 
observed in previous clinical studies with XIAFLEX in the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease, in that the majority of AEs occurred at the site of injection and resolved before the next scheduled treatment. 
• The immunogenicity profile of EN3835 in the Phase 2a EFP dose- ranging study is 
similar to that observed in the Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease 
programs. 
• Based on the efficacy and safety findings from the Phase 2a EFP dose- ranging study, 
the EN3835 0.84- mg dose was carried forward to the Phase 2 b study. 
The results from the Phase 2b EFP study (EN3835-201) further suggested that EN3835 0.84 mg is an effective treatment of EFP based on improvement in the severity of cellulite as determined 
by the Investigator and the subject. There were no safety concerns following EN3835 0.84 mg in the treatment of EFP (section  8.4). Safety findings from the Phase 2b EFP study are similar to 
that observed in previous clinical studies with XIAFLEX in the treatment of Dupu ytren’s 
contracture and Peyronie’s disease, in that that the majority of AEs occurred at the site of injection and resolved before the next scheduled treatment. The immunogenicity profile of 
EN3835 in the Phase 2b EFP study is similar to that observed in the Dupuytren’s contracture 
and Peyronie’s disease programs. 
Based on the efficacy and safety findings from the Phase 2a and 2b EFP studies, the EN3835 
0.84-mg dose per treatment area was carried forward to this study. The findings from previous 
studies tha t the majority of adverse events after EN3835 treatment are local to the injection site 
and that there is no quantifiable systemic exposure observed after concurrent treatment of two 
buttocks (total dose of 1.68 mg) supports the proposed study to evaluate EN3835 treatment of 
two buttocks. 
10.3. Study Drug Administration  
Study drug will be injected subcutaneously while the subject is in a prone position using a 
syringe with a 30 -gauge ½ -inch needle. Each injection site will receive a single skin injection of 
study drug administered as three 0.1-mL aliquots to Positions A, B, and C (for a total injection 
volume of 0.3 mL) as shown in the following figure. The depth of injection corresponds to the 
length of the treatment needle (0.5 inches) from the tip of the needle to the hub or base of the 
needle without downward pressure. 
During each treatment visit, 8 syringes (4 syringes per buttock) will be prepared for dosing. Each 
syringe will contain 0.9 mL of study drug (ie, 3 injections in each syringe). Twelve (12) skin 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 3 
05-Jun-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 60 
   10.4. Care Procedures After Injection  
To evaluate the subject for possible immediate immunological AEs, the subject will remain in 
direct observation of medical personnel who are skilled in the management of an allergic 
reaction for 30 minutes after recei ving the injections of study drug and until the subject exhibits 
no sign of an immunological or other clinically significant systemic or local AE. The subject’s 
vital signs should be stable before the subject can leave direct observation (see section  14.9).  
The Investigator or qualified designee will then apply a sterile dressing to the injection areas with hypoallergenic tape. The subject will be instructed to remove the dressing in the evening. 
10.5. Discussion of Study Design, Including the Choice of Control Groups  
The design of this study was based on the primary objective to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EN3835 0.84 mg per buttock in the concurrent treatment (total dose of 1.68 mg) of 2 bilateral 
buttocks with EFP in adult women compared with placebo treatment. The study design, a 
multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is in accordance with regulatory guidelines of adequate and well -controlled clinical studies (Food and Drug Administration [FDA] G uidance 
for Industry: Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products, 1998.; ICH E8 and E10).

A premature discontinuation will occur when a subject who signed informed consent ceases participation in the study, regardless of circumstances, prior to the completion of the protocol. Subjects can be prematurely discontinued from the study for one of the following reasons: 
• An adverse event  
• Lack of efficacy  
• A protocol violation (reason must be specified, for example: lack of compliance, use 
of a prohibited concomitant medication, failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria 
after study entry, etc)  
• Withdrawal by subject (reason must be specified) 
• The subject was “lost to follow-up” 
• Other reasons (reason must be specified, for example: the subject moved, pregnancy, 
Investigator decision, Sponsor decision to terminate trial, etc) 
If a subject discontinues from the study, all end-of-study procedures including safety and 
efficacy assessments should be conducted as detailed in the Schedule of Events (section 5) . The 
date a subject discontinues and the reason  for discontinuation will be recorded in the source 
documentation and electronic case report form (eCRF). If, however, a subject withdraws consent, no end-of-study procedures and assessments are required (but are encouraged to reduce missing information) except the collection of adverse event (AE) information. This information should be 
recorded in the source documentation and the eCRF. 
11.3.1. Replacement Procedures  
Subjects who discontinue from the study will not be replaced. 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 3 
05-Jun-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 64 
   12. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
12.1. Study Visits 
The Schedule of Events to be performed at each visit is shown in section 5. Provided below are 
further details where additional instruction about the assessments that will be performed is 
deemed to be needed.  
12.1.1. Infor med Consent  
Signed and dated informed consent will be obtained from each subject before any study procedures are undertaken, or before any changes to the subject’s medication regimen are made. Details about how the informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in 
section  21.3, Subject Information and Consent. 
12.1.2. Subject Screening  
Investigators will be expected to maintain a Screening log of all potential study subjects. This log 
will include limited information about the potential subject and the date and outcome of the 
screening process (eg, enrolled into the study, reason for ineligibility, or refused to participate). 
Investigators will provide information about the study to subjects who appear to me et the criteria 
for participation in the study. The screening log will be captured directly by the electronic data 
capture (EDC) system.  
12.1.2.1. Medical History  
During the screening period, the Investigator or qualified designee will obtain a medical history 
from each subject that includes relevant diagnoses and/or procedures/therapies with 
onset/resolutions dates. Medical histories should also include history of EFP (start date and 
family history), and history of tobacco and alcohol use (never, current, former). 
12.1.2.2. Screening Period (Day -14 to Day -1) 
Subjects meeting the relevant eligibility criteria listed in section  11 may be enrolled in the study 
after the nature and purpose of the protocol have been explained and written informed consent to 
participate has been voluntarily provided by the subject or their legally authorized representative. 
The subject identification number will consist of 8 digits. The first 4 digits represent the study 
site number followed by a 4- digit subject number. 
The following procedures will be performed and documented during the screening period: 
1. Obtain written informed consent (section 12.1.1) 
2. Evaluate eligibility based on inclusion/exclusion criteria (section  11.1 and section  11.2)  
3. Subject will have digital photographs taken of her two buttocks (section 13.1.1) 
4. Subjects will get instruction on the use of the PR- PCSS (section  13.1.2.1)  

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 3 
05-Jun-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 65 
   5. Prior to Investigator CR -PCSS assessment, subjects will rate each of their two buttocks 
using the PR- PCSS while viewing their digital images (section  13.1.2.1) ; the Investigator 
is blinded to these ratings 
6. After the subject has completed the PR -PCSS ratings, the Investigator will conduct live 
assessments of subject’s cellulite severity of each of the two buttocks using the CR- PCSS 
(section  13.1.2.6) ; the subject is blinded to these ratings . The ratings from the PR- PCSS 
and CR- PCSS will be used to assess initial eligibility of the buttocks for study entry  
7. Medical history including EFP history (section  12.1.2.1)  
8. Record prior and concomitant medications/procedures (section 12.8)  
9. Physical examination including measurement of body weight, height, Fitzpatrick skin 
type (section  14.11)

11. 12-lead ECG (section  14.10)  
12. Collection of samples for: 
a. Clinical laboratory testing (section  14.7) 
b. Serum pregnancy testing (section  14.7)  
13. Adverse events (section  14) 
12.2. Selecting and Marking Dimples during Treatment Visits  
Selection of dimples to be treated in the two buttocks is at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Dimples must be well-defined and evident when the subject is standing in a consistent, 
standardized relaxed pose (without the use of any manipulation such as skin pinching or muscle 
contraction). Each subject will receive 3 treatment visits of study drug according to randomization unless the buttock is dimple- free (score of 0 on CR -PCSS as reported by the 
Investigator) at Treatment Visit 2 and/or Treatment Visit 3 (a dimple - free buttock at Treatment 
Visit 1 is precluded by the eligibility criteria); a dimple -free buttock at Treatment Visit 2 and/or 
Treatment Visit 3 does not preclude treatment of the contralateral buttock unless it is dimple -free 
also. During each treatment visit, each of the buttocks will be photographed before and after marking dimples and injection sites while the subject is standing in a consistent, standardized relaxed pose as described in the Photography Manual. The celluli te severity assessments using 
the PR -PCSS and CR- PCSS will be completed prior to marking dimples and injection sites.  
The Investigator or qualified designee will select dimples within each buttock that are well-defined, evident when the subject is standing , and suitable for treatment; treatment consists of 
12 injections per buttock (24 injections total in two buttocks) per treatment visit. Because the goal of treatment is to improve the aesthetic appearance of each entire buttock, the Investigator will be instructed to select dimples that in his or her opinion would most improve the aesthetic 
appearance of each entire buttock. The same dimples within a buttock or different dimples within 
a buttock may be treated at each treatment visit but injections must all be within the buttocks (12 injections per buttock) for all 3 visits. Each buttock will receive all 3  treatment visits unless 
the buttock has no treatable EFP dimples and the Investigator rates the buttock a score of 0 on the CR -PCSS. If no injections in a particular buttock (right or left) are given at Treatment 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 3

   Visit 2, subjects will still be assessed for treatment in the contralateral buttock at Treatment 
Visit 2, and will return for the Day 43 visit and each of the buttocks will again be evaluated by 
the subject (PR -PCSS) and Investigator (CR-PCSS). If the Investigator rates either or both of the 
buttocks greater than 0 on the CR- PCSS, injections at Treatment Visit 3 should be given.  
For each dimple selected for treatment, the Investigator or qualified designee will choose injection sites (injection sites within a dimple should be spaced approximately 2 cm apart, if a 
dimple requires more than 1 injection; locating at least one injection site at the nadir, if present, of the dimple). Each injection site will be marked with a “dot” using a surgical marker. For 
round dimples, the “dot” will be placed in the center of the dimple; for elongated dimples, “dots” 
will be spaced out approximately 2 cm along the longer axis of the dimple. The Investigator or quali fied designee will then use a surgical marker to circle each of the dimples selected for 
treatment. Circles in the buttock should not overlap. 
Each of the buttocks will be photographed before and after marking dimples and injection sites 
while the subject is standing in a consistent, standardized relaxed pose as described in the 
Photography Manual. 
Examples of subject dimple and injection site markings are shown as follows: 
Sample Buttock Marking  
 
12.3. Digital Photography during Treatment Visits 1, 2, and 3  
During each treatment visit, each of the two buttocks will be photographed before and after 
marking dimples and injections sites while the subject is standing in a consistent, standardized 
relaxed pose as described in section  13.1.1.

   12.7. Unscheduled Visits 
If any subject needs to return to the site prior to her next scheduled visit, site staff should follow 
the Unsch eduled Visit procedures outlined in section 5. Site staff may conduct additional study 
procedures if required. 
12.8. Prior and Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
All prior medications taken within 90 days before randomization will be recorded. All medications (including over-the-counter medications) taken by the subject on Day 1 through the end of the study must be recorded. Any prior treatments (medications or procedures) for EFP 
through the end of the study must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. 
Additionally, any diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedures performed during the study 
period should be recorded including the date, indication for and description of the procedure. 
12.8.1. Prohibited Medications or Procedures  
The following medications are prohibited for randomized subjects during the study: 
anticoagulants (warfarin, heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors, Factor X inhibitors) and antiplatelet agents (aspirin >150 mg/day and P2Y12 inhibitors, such as clopidogrel), which can cause 
additional bruising. However the use of aspirin at a dose level of ≤150 mg per day will be 
permitted during study. 
Procedures listed in exclusion criterion #4 (section 11.2, Exclusion Criterion #4)  are prohibited 
for randomized subjects during the study. 
Table 4: Concomitant Medication Restrictions for Subjects during the Treatment 
Phase of Study  
Drug Class  Restrictions  
Anticoagulants  Subjects canno t take antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants (except for 
≤150 mg aspirin daily) within 7  days before and 7 days after the dosing 
administration.  
12.9. Treatment Compliance  
Randomized subjects will receive study drug administered by an Investigator at the 
Invest igator’s site.  
Accidental or intentional overdoses should be reported to the Sponsor/designee promptly (see 
section 14.6.2.1, Overdose). 
12.10.  Blinding and Randomization  
On Day 1, if each of the buttocks (ie, both buttocks) again meet the criteria (3 or 4 on the PR-PCSS and CR-PCSS), one buttock will be randomly assigned by the IWRS as the target 
buttock for the primary efficacy endpoint. Subjects, investigators, site personnel, and Endo 
personnel will be blinded to the identification of the target buttock.  
On Day 1, if each of the buttocks (ie, both buttocks) again meet the criteria (3 or 4 on the 
PR-PCSS and CR-PCSS), the subject will be randomized to a treatment group. The interactive 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 3 
05-Jun-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 71 
   web response system (IWRS) will randomly assign each subject to a treatment group (EN3835 
0.84 mg per buttock × two buttocks or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio within an investigational site. The 
treatment group will remain blinded to the Investigator, subjects, all site personnel, and the 
sponsor. The IWRS will assign the subject study drug kit numbers associated with the randomized treatment. At Day 22 and 43 visits, the IWRS will again assign the subject study 
drug kit numbers associated with the randomized treatment assigned at Day 1.  
All pr ecautions will be taken to ensure that the blinding of EN3835 and placebo is maintained 
throughout the study period. Unblinding will not be permitted by the study site unless it is 
deemed necessary for treatment of a medical emergency. Before breaking the blind, the 
Investigator should make every attempt to contact the Medical Monitor to discuss the necessity of breaking the blind. The study site will have the ability to immediately determine treatment 
identification in the event of an emergency by using the unblinding function within the IWRS, 
however, the Medical Monitor must be notified immediately. The Investigator will be required to make a full written explanation of the reason for unblinding the subject and the date. In the event 
that a subject is unblinded prior to contacting the Medical Monitor, the Investigator must provide 
this information in writing to the Medical Monitor as soon as possible. Breaking the blind at the investigative site will immediately disqualify the subject from further particip ation in the study. 
In addition, the event(s) leading to emergency unblinding must be reported as an SAE according to instructions in section 14.5.2, Reporting Serious Adverse Events . 
In addition, it may be necessary for the Investigator or qualified designee to unblind a subject as 
a result of a clinically significant finding noted during safety review by the Investigator, Safety 
Monitor, Medical Monitor and/or qualified designee that might jeopardize subject saf ety.

   13. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
13.1. Efficacy Measurements  
13.1.1. Digital Photography  
Although digital photographs are not direct efficacy measurements, digital photography will be 
utilized in the assessment of certain efficacy measurements ie to assess certain cellulite severity parameters at specific intervals (see section  5, Schedule of Events). At the Screening  visit, the 
Investigator or qualified designee will photograph each buttock using a Sponsor-supplied standardized digital camera in a standardized manner. The subject will be standing for each photography session and will be wea ring a standardized photographic garment as described in 
the Photography Manual. The Investigator or qualified designee will photograph each of the two buttocks while the subject is standing in a consistent, standardized relaxed standing pose, ie, standing position with relaxed gluteus muscles, at the following time points:  
• Screening (no markings of dimples or injection site) - each of the two buttocks 
• Before and after marking dimples and injection sites (prior to injections) on Days 1, 22, and 43 - each of the two buttocks 
• During the Day 71 visit (end of study/early termination) (no dimple or injection site 
markings) - each of the two buttocks 
All photographs from this study are the property of Endo and may be utilized for clinical 
development, scientific communication, marketing, regulatory purposes, and/or legal applications as required/desired by Endo. 
13.1.2. Subject and Investigator Cellulite Assessments  
Investigator cellulite assessments are independent of the subject assessments. Therefore, all 
subject cellulite assessments must be completed before the Investigator’s cellulite assessments 
are initiated. At each visit prior to the subject assessments  being completed, subjects will watch 
an ePRO and scale tutorial video and instructions. The site will document subject review of the 
training (video and instructions) in source documentation. The subject assessments will be done 
using a subject- assigned p assword protected electronic patient reported outcome (ePRO) system 
and the Investigator and study site personnel will not have access to the subject’s assessments or 
password; the clinician assessment will be recorded in an investigator-assigned password 
protected system and the subject will not have access to the Investigator’s assessments or 
password. Subject assessments will be done alone with no study site personnel in the room. Investigators will be instructed not to verbalize their ratings while in the presence of the subject.  
13.1.2.1. Patient -Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (PR -PCSS)  
The PR -PCSS will be conducted for the purpose of assessing the severity of cellulite in the 
buttock. The scale is a 5 -level photonumeric scale developed specifically for patients and used 
by the subject to assess the severity of their cellulite in the buttocks by viewing digital images of 
each of their buttocks captured by photography at the visit; the ratings range from 0 (None) to 
4 (Severe) with labels and descri ptors to aid the subject in the assessments.  

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 3 
05-Jun-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 73 
   At Screening and at the beginning of their visits on Day 1, Day 22, Day 43, and Day 71, subjects 
will have digital photographs taken of each of their two buttocks. Subjects will be given 
instructions in the proper use (Patient Instructions for Use of PR- PCSS) of the PR -PCSS and 
then perform the PR-PCSS for each of the buttocks (Appendix B ). While viewing the digital 
images of each of their buttocks on a standardized computer monitor and using PR- PCSS for 
buttock, subjects will be instructed to answer the following question for each buttock: Today, 
how would you rate the severity of your cellulite in the area displayed using the PR-PCSS? The subject will be given the fo llowing explanations : Please try to match the severity of your 
cellulite, as seen in this digital image, with one of the cellulite levels on the PR -PCSS. Please 
look at the image of your cellulite and the pictures, labels, and descriptions on the PR-PCSS carefully before selecting your answer. If you feel that your cellulite level is between 2 of the 
levels, please select the level that is closest to your image. If you feel that your cellulite is exactly 
halfway between two PR- PCSS levels of cellulite severity, please select the more severe 
response. 
The subject will enter their rating electronically into an ePRO system; the Investigator and other 
site personnel will be blinded to the rating entered by the subject. This variable will be entered directly into  the EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve as the direct point of data 
capture and will serve as source for this variable.  
13.1.2.2. Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (S -GAIS)  
Subjects will complete the S -GAIS for each of the buttocks as descr ibed below at the Day 22, 
Day 43, and Day 71 study visits using the pre- treatment Day 1 digital image (Baseline) of each 
of the buttocks for comparison. 
All treated subjects will be instructed to answer the following question for each buttock:  How would you rate the appearance of your treated cellulite after treatment? 
The S -GAIS assessment will occur after the subject has completed the PR -PCSS assessment to 
avoid introducing potential bias to the static PR- PCSS assessment. The subject will view each of 
their pre -treatment Day 1 digital images alongside their Day 22, Day 43 or Day 71/End of study 
visit digital images of each of their buttocks to aid in the assessment ( Table 5) . Subjects will 
provide a rating from those below that best represents their answer for each treated buttock.  
This variable will be entered directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve 
as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.

13.1.2.3. Patient Reported Cellulite Impact Scale (PR -CIS)  
At the Day 1 visit and the Day 71 visit, subjects will be instructed to answer 6 questions related 
to the areas selected for treatment on their buttocks on the PR -CIS ( Appendix D)  while vi ewing 
digital images of their buttocks. The PR -CIS assesses the visual and emotional impact of cellulite 
(happy, bothered, self-conscience, embarrassed, looking older, or looking overweight or out of shape) using a 6 -question survey, with each question rat ed on a numerical rating scale from 
0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely).  
This variable will be entered directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.  
13.1.2.4. Subjec t Satisfaction with Cellulite Treatment Assessment  
At the Day 71 visit, subjects will be instructed to answer a question related to their treated 
buttocks  while viewing digital images of their buttocks.  Subjects will be given a list of responses 
and they will provide a rating from those below that best represents their answer (Table 6). 
Today, how satisfied are you with the results of the cellulite treatment you received on the 
specific area or areas on your buttocks that were treated? 
This variable will be  entered directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve 
as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.

   13.1.2.5. Subject Self -Rating Scale (SSRS)  
The SSRS is a measure that assesses subject satisfaction with appearance in asso ciation with 
cellulite on the buttocks using whole numbers on a 7- level scale that ranges from 0 (extremely 
dissatisfied to 6 (extremely satisfied). The patient will be asked to respond to the question related 
to the satisfaction with appearance of the cel lulite on their buttocks on the appropriate visit day 
(note Day 71 question is different than Day 1 question). No photographs or reference to previous 
ratings or evaluations will be used. Subjects will be given a list of responses and they will 
provide a rating from those below that best represents their answer (Table 7); the list of 
responses is the same for Day 1 and for Day 71. 
On Day 1 (Baseline), subjects will be instructed to answer: Considering your appearance in 
association with your cellulite on your buttocks, how satisfied do you feel with your appearance at the present time?  
On Day 71, subjects will be instructed to answer:  Considering your appearance in association 
with your cellulite on your buttocks, how satisfied do you feel with your appearance at the present time whether or not in your judgment it is due entirely to treatment with EN3835? 
This variable will be entered directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve 
as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.

13.1.2.6. Clinician -Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR -PCSS)  
The CR -PCSS will be conducted for the purpose of assessing the severity of cellulite in the 
buttock. The scale is a 5 -level photonumeric scale developed specifically for clinicians and used 
by the Investigator to assess the severity of the subject’s cellulite in each buttock by live assessments; the ratings range from 0 (None) to 4 (Severe) with labels and descriptors to aid the Investigator in the assessments.  
Investigators will be trained and qualified on the use of the CR- PCSS prior to assessing any 
subjects.  
At the Screening visit, the Investigator will determine severity of cellulite of each of the 
two buttocks via live assessment of the subject using the CR -PCSS for buttock (Appendix C ) 
after the subject has completed her self -assessment using the PR -PCSS. Before injections on 
treatment visits Day  1, Day 22, and Day 43, and on visit Day 71; Investigators wil l evaluate each 
of the two buttocks by live assessments using the CR-PCSS for the buttock to make his/her 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 3

   evaluation. At each visit, the Investigator will make his/her assessment independently and after 
the subject has conducted her self- assessment using t he PR -PCSS.  
This variable will be entered directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.  
13.1.2.7. Investigator Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (I -GAIS)  
Investi gators will be trained by Endo or their designee on the use of the I- GAIS prior to 
assessing any subjects.  At each visit, the Investigator may review the training and use material for the I -GAIS. On the Day 22, Day 43, and Day 71 study visits, the Investi gator will determine 
the degree of improvement of each buttock by comparing the cellulite from the Day 1 pre-
treatment (Baseline) digital image of each buttock to the cellulite seen in a live assessment 
(Table 8). The I- GAIS assessment will occur after the CR- PCSS assessment (section  13.1.2.6) to 
avoid introducing potential bias to the static CR- PCSS assessment by the Investigator. For each 
buttock, the Investigator will provide the rating from those below that be st represents his/her 
answer.  
This variable will be entered directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve 
as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.

   14. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
14.1. Definitions 
14.1.1. Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable or unintended change in body structure (signs), body 
function (symptoms), laboratory result (eg, chemistry, ECG, X- ray, etc), or worsening of a 
pre-existing condition associated temporally with the use of the study medication whether or not 
considered related to the study medication. Adverse events will be captured once a subject has signed the informed consent. AEs include: 
• Changes in the general condition of the subject 
• Subjective symptoms offered by or elicited from the subject  
• Objective signs observed by the Investigator or other study personnel 
• All concurrent diseases that occur after the start of the study, including any change in 
severity or frequency of pre- existing disease  
• All clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities or physical findings that occur during the study 
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is any condition that was not present prior to 
treatment with study medication but appeared following treatment, was present at treatment 
initiation but worsened during treatment, or was present at treatment initiation but resolved and then reappeared while the individual was on treatment (regardless of the intensity of the AE 
when the treatment was initiated).  
All AEs, including both observed or volunteered problems, complaints, signs or symptoms must 
be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF, regardless of whether associated with the use of study 
medication. This would include AEs resulting from concurrent illness, reactions to concurrent 
medic ation use, or progression of disease states (excluding the disease under study). A condition 
present at baseline that worsens after initiation of study treatment will be captured as an AE; the 
onset date will be the date the event worsened. The AE should be recorded in standard medical 
terminology when possible. 
14.1.2. Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an AE that:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening (there is an immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred; this does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more serious form may 
have caused death) 
• Results in or prolongs an inpatient hospitalization (Note: a hospitalization for elective or pre -planned surgery, procedure, or drug therapy does not constitute an SA E) 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 3 
05-Jun-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 78 
   • Results in permanent or substantial disability (permanent or substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in offspring of a subject using the study medication regardless of time to diagn osis)  
• Is considered an important medical event 
Important medical events are defined as events that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious out comes. Examples of important medical events include malignancy, allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. 
14.2. Monitoring Adverse Events  
At each visit, subjects will be queried regarding any AEs that have occurred since the last visit. 
Subjects will be asked to volunteer information concerning AEs with a non-leading question 
such as, “How do you feel?” Study site personnel will then record all pertinent information in the 
source documents and the eCRF. The study drug compliance record should also be reviewed to detect potential overdoses (intentional/unintentional). 
14.3. Relationship to Study D rug 
The degree of “relatedness” of the AE to the study medication must be described using the following scale:  
• Not related  indicates that the AE is definitely not related to the study medication.  
• Unlikely related  indicates that there are other, more likely  causes and study 
medication is not suspected as a cause.  
• Possibly related indicates that a direct cause and effect relationship between study 
medication and the AE has not been demonstrated, but there is evidence to suggest 
there is a reasonable possibility that the event was caused by the study medication.  
• Probably related  indicates that there is evidence suggesting a direct cause and effect 
relationship between the AE and the study medication. 
It is the Sponsor’s policy to consider “Probably related” and “Possibly related” causality 
assessments as positive causality. “Not related” and “Unlikely related” causality assessments are 
considered as negative causality.  
Assessments will be recorded on the eCRF and must indicate clearly the relationship being 
assessed. For example, an AE that appears during a placebo run-in phase would be assessed with 
respect to the placebo treatment received and/or study procedures conducted during this phase. If the AE continued into an active treatment phase, the relationship w ould be assessed for the active 
treatment phase only if the AE worsened.  

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 3 
05-Jun-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 79 
   14.4. Intensity Assessment  
The intensity (or severity) of AEs is characterized as mild, moderate, or severe:  
• Mild  AEs are usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and do not inter fere 
with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate AEs introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and 
may interfere with daily activities, but are usually ameliorated by simple therapeutic measures.  
• Severe AEs interrupt a subject’s us ual daily activity and typically require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. 
When the intensity category of an AE changes, the greatest intensity during that continuous 
episode should be recorded. 
14.5. Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
14.5.1. Reporting Adverse Events  
Throughout the study, AEs will be documented on the source document and on the appropriate page of the eCRF whether or not considered treatment-related. This includes any new signs, symptoms, injury or illness, including increased severity of previously existing signs, symptoms, 
injury, or illness. Conditions existing prior to screening will be recorded as part of the subject’s 
medical history. The Investigator is responsible for assessing the relationship of AEs to the study medicat ion; relationship will be classified as not related, unlikely related, possibly related, or 
probably related.  
All AEs will be collected by the Investigator from the time of signing the informed consent through 28 days after the last dose of study medication; this includes any AEs that are ongoing at 
the time of completion/termination of the study. All ongoing AEs must be followed until 
resolution or for 30 days after the subject’s last study visit, whichever comes first. 
14.5.2. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Any SAE, including death resulting from any cause, which occurs to any subject participating in 
this study must be reported via email or fax by the Investigator using the Endo Clinical Trial 
Report Form for SAEs within 24 hours of first becoming aware of the SAE. SAEs will be collected by the Investigator from the time of signing the informed consent through 28 days after 
the last dose of study medication. SAEs that occur within 28 days, following cessation of the 
study treatment, or within 30 days, following premature discontinuation from the study for any reason, must also be reported within the same timeframe. Any SAE that is felt by the Investigator 
to be related to the study medication must be reported regardless of the amount of time since the 
last dose r eceived. Follow-up information collected for any initial report of an SAE must also be 
reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of receipt by the Investigator. 
All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization of condition, or until follow-up is no 
longer possible. 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 3 
05-Jun-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 80 
   In the event discussion is necessary regarding treatment of a subject, call the Medical 
Monitor (see contact information in section  3). 
All SAEs should be sent via the email address, or faxed to the fax number, provided in section  3. 
The Sponsor will determine whether the SAE must be reported within 7 or 15 days to regulatory 
authorities in compliance with local and regional law. If so, the Sponsor (or the Sponsor’s 
representative) will report the event to the appropriate regulatory authorities. The Investigator will report SAEs to the IRB per their IRB policy.  
14.5.2.1. Follow- up Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
To fully understand the nature of any SAE, obtaining follow- up information is important. 
Whenever possible, relevant medical records such as discharge summaries, medical consultations, and the like should be obtained. In the event of death, regardless of cause, all 
attempts should be made to obtain the death certificate and any autopsy report. These records 
should be reviewed in detail, and the Investigator should comment on any event, lab abnormality, or any other finding, noting whether it should be considered a serious or 
non-serious AE, or whether it should be considered as part of the subject’s history. In addition, 
all events or other findings determined to be SAEs should be identified on the follow-up SAE form and the Investigator should consider whether the event is related or not related to stud y 
drug. 
14.6. Special Reporting Situations  
14.6.1. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events such as bruising, ecchymosis, hematomas, and contusions that occur remote to the site of drug administration, or any  hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, w ill be 
recorded and evaluated for seriousness and severity (see section  14.1.1, Adverse Events or 
section  14.1.2, Serious Adverse Events). 
In addition, local AEs associated with the injection site, including bruising, pain, nodules/mass, 
ulceration, erythema, pruritus, swelling, and/or induration, will be recorded and evaluated for 
seriousness and severity (see as appropriate, section  14.1.1, Adverse Events or section  14.1.2, 
Serious Adverse Events) 
14.6.2. Overdose/Misuse/Abuse 
14.6.2.1. Overdose  
Study drug overdose is any accidental or intentional use of study drug in an amount higher than 
the dose indicated by the protocol for that subject. Study drug compliance (see section 12.9) should be reviewed to detect potential instances of overdose (intentional or accidental). 
Any study drug overdose during the study should be noted on the study medication eCRF. 
An overdose is not an AE per se, however all AEs associated with an overdose should both be 
entered on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported using the procedures detailed in section 14.5.2, 
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events, even if the events do not meet seriousness criteria. If the 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 3 
05-Jun-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 81 
   AE associated with an overdose does not meet seriousness criteria, it must still be reported using 
the Endo Clinical Trial Report Form for SAEs and in an expedited manner, but should be noted 
as non-serious on the form and the Adverse Event eCRF. 
14.6.3. Pregnancy  
Subjects should be instructed to immediately notify the Investigator of any pregnancies. 
Any pregnancy that occurs in a subject during this clinical study will be reported for tracking 
purposes only . All subject pregnancies that are identified during or after this study, where the 
estimated date of conception is determined to have occurred during study drug therapy or within 
28 days of the last dose of study medication need to be reported, followed to conclusion, and the 
outcome reported, even if the subject is discontinued from the study. The Investigator should 
report all pregnancies within 24 hours using the Initial Pregnancy Report Form, and any pregnancy-associated SAE using the SAE report form, according to the usual timelines and 
directions for SAE reporting provided in section 14.5.2. Monitoring of the pregnancy should 
continue until conclusion of the pregnancy; 1 or more Follow-up Pregnancy Report Form(s) detailing progress, and a Two Month Follow-up Pregnancy Report Form detailing the outcome, 
should be submitted. 
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that t he investigational 
product under study may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. 
Likewise, elective abortions without complications are not considered AEs. Any SAEs 
associated with pregnancy (eg, congenital abnormalities/bir th defects/spontaneous miscarriages 
or any other serious events) must additionally be reported as such using the SAE report form. 
Spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported and handled as SAEs. 
A subject who becomes pregnant must be withdrawn from the study . Attempts to obtain the 
pregnancy follow -up and pregnancy outcome information detailed above are necessary even if a 
subject discontinues treatment because of pregnancy.  
14.6.4. AEs/SAEs Experienced by Non -subjects Exposed to Study Medication  
Non-subjects are persons who are not enrolled in the study but have been exposed to study 
medication, including instances of diversion of study medication. All such AEs/SAEs occurring 
in non-subjects from such exposure will be reported to the Endo PVRM Department (when the 
non-subject agrees) on the departmental form for serious adverse experiences regardless of 
whether the event is serious or not. Instructions for completing the form for events experienced 
by non-subjects will be provided. SAEs occurring in non- subject s exposed to study medication 
will be processed within the same SAE reporting timelines as described in section  14.5.2, 
Reporting Serious Adverse Events. Additionally, the drug accountability source documentation at the site should reflect this occurrence.  
14.7. Clinical Laboratory Determinations  
Clinical laboratory tests will be conducted according to the Schedule of Events (section 5). 
Clinical laboratory tests will be perfo rmed by a designated central laboratory . Each site will be 
provided with instructions on specimen collection, preparation, packaging and transport. Refer to the central laboratory manual for further information regarding sample collection, handling, and labeling. The results of the tests will be returned to the investigational sites.  

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 3 
05-Jun-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 82 
   Clinical laboratory test data will be reviewed by the Investigator, or designee, and additional 
clinical laboratory tests may be ordered at his/her discretion (eg, if the results of any clinical 
laboratory test falls outside the reference range or clinical symptoms necessitate additional 
testing to ensure safety). Any additional testing will be performed by the designated central laboratory. The Investigator or qualified designee must acknowledge the review of laboratory 
results.  
The Investigator will review all abnormal lab results for potentially clinically important. Any 
abnormal clinical laboratory test result meeting the Investigator’s criteria for potentially 
clinically important (refer to central laboratory manual) will be recorded as an AE or SAE as 
appropriate (see section 14.1.1, Adverse Events, and section 14.1.2, Serious Adverse Ev ents).  
Laboratory results will be sent electronically to Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. for data management.

For women of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening and 
Day 71/End of Study/Early Termination, and urine pregnancy tests will be performed at Day 1, Day 22, and Day 43 (refer to section 5). Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a 
negative pregnancy test at the Screening Visit a nd at Day 1 (Baseline), Day 22, and Day 43 to be 
randomized and/or receive treatment in the study. If necessary, additional urine pregnancy tests 
can be performed at any time during the study at the discretion of the Investigator. Urine 
pregnancy test kits will be supplied by the Sponsor. 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 3

   14.11.  Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination will be performed at the Screening Visit. All examinations will 
be performed by a physician or health professional listed on the Form FDA 1572 and licensed to 
perform physical examinations. Height and body weight will be me asured and recorded at 
screening.  
The Investigator will review all physical exam findings for clinical significance. Any physical exam finding meeting the Investigator’s or Sponsor’s criteria for clinical significance will be 
recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate (see section  14.1.1, Adverse Events and section  14.1.2, 
Serious Adverse Events ). 
At screening, the Investigator will also assess the subject’s skin type using the Fitzpatrick scale 
(Table 11). Only the Fitzpatrick Scale shown below may be used during the study. 
Table 11: Fitzpatrick Scale  
I Pale white skin, blue/hazel eyes, blond/red hair  Always burns, does not tan 
II Fair skin, blue eyes  Burns easily, tans poorly 
III Darker white skin  Tans after initial burn  
IV Light brown skin  Burns minimally, tans easily  
V Brown skin  Rarely burns, tans darkly easily  
VI Dark brown or black skin  Never burns, always tans darkly  
Follow-up body weight will be measured before injection on Day 22 and Day 43 and at the 
Day 71 visit.

   17.2. Subject Populations  
Four (4) populations are considered in the statistical analysis of the study: safety, intent- to-treat 
(ITT), modified ITT (mITT), and per-protocol (PP). 
17.2.1. Safety Population 
The safety population is defined as all enrolled subjects who ha ve received at least one injection 
of study medication. All safety parameters will be summarized based on this population. 
17.2.2. Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT population is defined as all randomized subjects who have received at least one 
injection of study medication. All demographic and baseline characteristic summaries will be 
based on this population. The primary and key secondary efficacy parameters will be summarized based on this population. 
17.2.3. Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population 
The mITT po pulation is defined as all intent- to-treat subjects with a baseline and at least 1 
post-injection evaluation of both the Investigator CR-PCSS and subject PR-PCSS for both the 
target and non-target buttocks. All secondary and supportive efficacy evaluations will be based 
on the mITT population. 
17.2.4. Per-Protocol (PP) Population 
The PP population is defined as the mITT subjects without any of the following:  
• Placebo randomized subject who receives EN3835 treatment. 
• EN3835 randomized subject who receives placebo treatment only throughout study. 
• Any subject who uses protocol-prohibited medications. 
• Subject missing PR -PCSS and/or CR- PCSS assessment at Day 71.  
• Subject with a buttock not receiving all three treatment sessions without medical 
reasons (e.g., adverse event s or CR -PCSS rated as zero (0)).  
• Subject who did not meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
This population may be used in the efficacy sensitivity analysis. 
17.3. Subject Disposition  
The number of subjects included in each study population will be summariz ed by treatment 
group. Subjects excluded from the safety and efficacy (eg, ITT) populations will be listed by treatment group.  
The number and percentage of subjects completed and prematurely discontinued during the treatment period will be presented for ea ch treatment group and pooled across treatment groups. 
Screen failures (ie, screened but not randomized subjects) and the associated failure reasons will 
be tabulated overall. Reasons for premature discontinuation from the treatment period as 
recorded on the termination page of the eCRF will be summarized (number and percentage) by 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 3 
05-Jun-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 89 
   treatment group for all randomized subjects. Percentage of premature discontinuations will be 
compared between treatment groups.  
17.4. Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
The summarization of demographic variables (eg, age, sex, race, weight, height, and body mass index [BMI]), medical and surgical history, and other baseline characteristics relevant to the indication studied in the study will be described. 
Demographic characteristics, including sex, age, age group, race, height, and weight, will be 
summarized by treatment group, for the ITT population, using descriptive statistics. All screening characteristics and medical information will also be summarized by treatment gro up 
using descriptive statistics. The descriptive summaries will include frequency tables for all categorical response variables and n, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum for all continuous variables.  
17.5. Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy endpoints including supportive efficacy analysis will be summarized as percentages. 
The dichotomous secondary endpoints (ie, responder endpoints) will be analyzed using a 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted for Investigator. Changes in the PR- PCSS rating s and 
CR-PCSS ratings from baselines, S -GAIS scores, I -GAIS scores, and SSRS scores will be 
analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Changes in PR- CIS from baselines will be analyzed 
using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for baseline values. All the tests are two -
sided. 
The primary endpoint will be summarized as percentages and analyzed using a Cochran- Mantel -
Haenszel test that compares the 2 treatment groups and adjusts for Investigator at a level of 
significance of 0.05 based on the ITT population. Any subject who does not have an evaluation 
of CR -PCSS and/or PR- PCSS at Day 71 will be classified as a non -responder. 
The key secondary efficacy analyses will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary 
endpoint based on the ITT population. Any subject who does not have an evaluation at Day 71 
will be classified as a non -responder for the analyses. The family #1 key secondary efficacy 
analyses will be performed only if the primary efficacy analysis is significant ( p ≤ 0.05; 
gatekeeping strategy).  Similarly family #2 key secondary efficacy analyses will be performed 
only if at least one of the key secondary efficacy endpoints of family #1 is significant ( p ≤ 
0.0125; parallel gatekeeping strategy) and family #3 key secondary efficacy analyses will be 
performed only if at least one of the key secondary efficacy endpoints of family #2 is significant 
(parallel gatekeeping strategy). Within a family of key secondary efficacy endpoints, the 
Bonferroni method will be performed to relocate unused alpha for testing each endpoint to assure an overall error rate of p ≤ 0.05. The details of the testing procedures will be provided in the 
statistical analysis plan for the study.  
All supportive endpoints will be summarized as subject counts and percentages for cate gorical 
data or n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous data. All the supportive 
analyses will be performed based on all observed data (ie, missing data not imputed) in the mITT 
population at all visits without multiplicity adjustment. This analysis will also be performed at Day 71 with missing data at Day 71 imputed by a last observation carried forward (LOCF) 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 3 
05-Jun-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 90 
   approach if subjects have at least one post-dose assessment. The dichotomous secondary 
endpoints (ie, responder endpoints) will be analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test 
adjusted for Investigator. Changes in the PR-PCSS ratings and CR- PCSS ratings from baselines, 
S-GAIS scores, I -GAIS scores, and SSRS scores will be analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum 
test. Changes in PR- CIS f rom baselines will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) adjusted for baseline values. 
17.5.1. Primary Efficacy Variable 
The primary efficacy variable is the proportion of 2-level composite responders at Day 71 
defined as subjects with: 
• an improveme nt in severity from baseline (Day 1 visit) of at least 2 levels of severity 
in the CR-PCSS as assessed live by the Investigator of the target buttock, and  
• an improvement in severity from baseline of at least 2  levels of severity in the 
PR-PCSS by the subj ect while viewing the digital image of the target buttock.  
A subject will be considered a responder if these criteria are met in the randomized target buttock of that subject.  
Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint will include: 
• ITT subjects with missing data handled by multiple imputation (MI) approach 
• ITT subjects with missing data handled by an LOCF approach 
• mITT subjects with missing data handled by an LOCF approach 
• Observed data only (no missing data handling) 
• Per-protocol (PP) subjects with mi ssing data handled by an LOCF approach if 10% or 
more subjects are excluded in the PP population from mITT population 
17.5.2. Secondary Efficacy Variables 
17.5.2.1. Key Secondary Variables 
There will be 8 key secondary endpoints grouped in three families of 2 to 4 endpoints per family 
analyzed in hierarchical order.  
• Family #1 – four endpoints: 
− Proportion of 1- level PR -PCSS responders defined as subjects with ≥1- level 
improvement in PR-PCSS severity rating of the target buttock at Day 71 
compared to Day 1 
− Proportion of 2- level PR -PCSS responders defined as subjects with ≥2- level 
improvement in PR-PCSS severity rating of the target buttock at Day 71 
compared to Day 1

PR-PCSS of the target buttock) at Day  71 compared to Day 1  
− Proportion of 2-level composite responders of the non-target buttock at Day 71 compared to Day 1 
• Family #2 – two endpoints:  
− Proportion of 1- level SSRS responders defined as subjects who were at least 
slightly satisfied at Day 71 (SSRS rating ≥ 4)  
− Change from baseline (Day 1) of the PR- CIS total score at Day 71  
• Family #3 – two endpoints:  
− Proportion of 1- level S -GAIS responders defined as subjects with ≥1- level 
improvement (improved, much improved or very much improved) in the S- GAIS 
assessment of the target buttock at Day 71 
− Proportion of 2- level S -GAIS responders defined as subjects with ≥2- level 
improvement (much improved or very much improved) in the S- GAIS assessment 
of the target buttock at Day 71 
Sensitivity analyses for the key secondary endpoints will include:

   17.6. Safety Analyses  
Safety variables include adverse events, laboratory parameters, vital signs, ECG parameters, and 
physical examinations. For each safety parameter, the last assessment made prior to the first dose 
of study drug will be used as the baseline for all analyses of that safety parameter.  
17.6.1. Prior, Concomitant, and Follow- up Medication  
The World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary will be used to classify prior and 
concomitant medications by therape utic class. Prior medication will be defined as any 
medication taken prior to the first dose of study drug. Concomitant medication is defined as any medication taken on or after the date of first dose of study drug. 
Prior and concomitant medication use will be summarized descriptively by the number and 
percentage of subjects for each preferred term (generic name from WHO dictionary) by 
treatment. Multiple use of the same medication by a subject will be counted only once. 
17.6.2. Study Drug Exposure  
The following information regarding treatment will be summarized per each treated buttock by 
treatment group:  
• Total number of treatment visits  
• Number of subjects who had treatment session done or treatment session not done at each treatment visit  
• For subjects who had the treatment session done, the number of subjects who got all 24 injections at the treatment visit or who received less than 24 injections 
• Number of injections given at each treatment visit  
• Number of dimples treated at each treatment visit  
• Average number of injections per dimple at each treatment visit  
Subjects who did not receive all 3 treatment visits and who did not receive 24 injections at a 
treatment visit will be listed.  
17.6.3. Measurement of Treatment Compliance  
Not applicable (the study drug is administered at the site by the study investigator).  
17.6.4. Adverse Events  
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be used to code AEs.  
An AE (classified by preferred term) that started on or after the date of the first dose of the study drug will be considered a TEAE if it was not present prior to the first dose of study drug, or was 
present prior to the first dose of study drug but increased in intensity during the treatment period. 
If more than 1 AE is reported prior to the first dose of study drug and coded to the same 
preferred term, then the AE with the greatest intensity will be used as the benchmark for 
comparison to the AEs occurring during the treatment period which were also coded to that 
preferred term. Any AE present prior to the first dose of study drug that increases in intensity 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 3 
05-Jun-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 96 
   during the treatment period will be re -entered with a new start date of the date of increased 
intensity.  
Descriptive statistics (the number and percentage) for subjects reporting TEAEs in each 
treatment group will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term; by system organ class, preferred term, and severity; and by system organ class, preferred term, and relationship to 
study drug. If more than 1 AE is coded to the same preferred term for the same subje ct, the 
subject will be counted only once for that preferred term using the most severe and most related 
occurrence for the summarization by severity and by relationship to the study drug. 
The by -frequency summaries will also include incidence of the SAEs and non- SAEs by preferred 
term that at least 2% of the subjects in one treatment group. Duration of AEs will be tabulated by 
treatment group.  
The Fisher exact test will be used to compare EN3835 to placebo. 
Listings will be presented for subjects with SAEs , subjects with AEs leading to discontinuation 
of study or study drug, and subjects who die (if any). 
17.6.5. Vital Signs  
Descriptive statistics for vital signs (eg, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and 
body weight) and their changes from baseline at each visit and at the end of study will be presented by treatment group. 
Vital sign values are potentially clinically important (PCI) if they meet both the observed value 
criteria and the change from baseline criteria. The criteria for PCI vital sign values will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The PCI percentages will be calculated relative to 
the number of subjects with baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment. A supportive 
listing of subject values will be provided including the subject ID, study center, treatment group, baseline and post- baseline values.  
The change from baseline for vital signs parameters are compared between EN3835 and placebo using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a factor of drug (EN3835 or placebo) while the Fisher exact test will be used for the incidence of PCI values.  
17.6.6. Clinical Laboratory Parameters  
Descriptive statistics for clinical laboratory values in International System of Units (SI units) and changes from baseline at Day 71 will be presen ted by treatment group for each clinical 
laboratory parameter.  
The number and percentage of subjects with potentially clinically important (PCI) post- baseline 
clinical laboratory values will be tabulated by treatment group. The criteria for PCI laboratory values will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The PCI percentages will be 
calculated relative to the number of subjects with at least one post -baseline assessment. A 
supportive listing of subjects with post- baseline PCI values will be pro vided, including the 
subject ID, study center, treatment group, baseline and post- baseline values.  
The change from baseline for clinical laboratory parameters are compared between EN3835 and 
placebo using an ANOVA with a factor of drug (EN3835 or placebo) while the Fisher exact test will be used for the incidence of PCI values.

   18.5. Study Drug Accountability  
A drug inventory form must be kept current by the site staff designated to be responsible for 
reconstitution and must be made available to the clinical monitor, Endo employees, IRB/IEC, 
and regulatory agencies for routine inspection and accountability during monitoring visits. When 
instructed by Endo, the Investigator agrees to return all original used or unused study drug kits to Endo's return vendor. 
18.5.1. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
The Investigator agrees not to supply study drug to any person except to those subjects enrolled 
in the study. The Investigator is responsible for recording the receipt and use of all drugs supplied and for ensuring the supervision of the storage and allocation of these supplies. All used 
and unused study drug will be returned, and unit counts will be performed whenever medication 
is returne d. The site must account for all study drug received and its use. At the end of the study, 
all used and unused drug supplies will be returned to Endo’s return vendor.

   22. DATA HANDLING AND RE CORDKEEPING  
22.1. Data  Collection  
Endo will provide an electronic data capture (EDC) system for this study. Data collection will 
involve the use of an EDC system to which only authorized personnel will have access. The system will be secured to prevent unauthorized access to the data or the system. This will include 
the requirement for a user ID and password to enter or change data. The level of access to the 
EDC system will be dependent on the person’s role in the study. 
Study data will be collected from source documents and entered into an eCRF within the EDC 
system. The Investigator will be responsible for ensuring the eCRFs are completed in a timely 
manner relative to the subject’s visit. In addition to periodic monitoring occurring within the system by a Sponsor monitor, programmatic edit checks will be used to review EDC data for 
completeness, logic, and adherence to the study protocol. As a result of this monitoring and these 
checks, queries may be issued electronically to the clinical study sites and closed electronically by the monitor, data management staff or authorized staff at the study site. Additionally, the 
Investigator will review eCRFs, ensure all missing or corrected data is provided and will sign the 
eCRF pages with an electronic signature.  
An electronic audit t rail will be maintained in the EDC system to track all changes made to data 
entered in the eCRF. Data will be retrievable in such a fashion that all information regarding each individual subject is attributable to that subject. Unless otherwise indicated, all data captured in the eCRF must first be captured in source documents. Data that can be directly 
recorded in the eCRF will be clearly identified in the section(s) of the protocol that describes the 
assessment(s).  
Data entries will be corrected by changing the entry in the EDC system. Any changes or 
corrections to eCRF data will be electronically tracked and will include the reason for correction, 
who made the correction and the date/time stamp when the correction was made within the audit trail of the ED C system.  
In addition, any contact with the subject via telephone or other means that provide significant clinical information must be documented in source documents as described above. 
22.2. Study Documentation  
Upon study completion, the Investigator will be provided with complete electronic copies of the 
case report form (CRF) data for his/her files.

   2. SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
EN3835-302 protocol amendments and amended informed consent forms (as necessary) have 
been reviewed and approved by the governing Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) before 
implementation of the amendments at each study center.  
Amendment 2 was incorporated into the protocol on January 1 6, 2018. The major reason s for 
this amendment are revising the primary efficacy variable from at least one buttock to a 
randomly selected target buttock, revising key secondary endpoints, and adding an additional 
efficacy assessment.

4 Synopsis, Study Design  Added text  Of the two assigned eligible buttocks, one buttock will be randomly selected as the target buttock for the primary efficacy endpoint. The 
other (remaining) buttock will be  considered 
the non- target buttock. Subjects, investigators, 
site personnel, and Endo personnel will be 
blinded to the identification of the target and the non- target buttocks.  
At Day 1, the subject will complete a Patient Reported Cellulite Impact Scale  (PR-CIS) 
assessment.  At Day 1, the subject will complete a Patient Reported Cellulite Impact Scale (PR -CIS) 
assessment and a Subject Self -Rating Scale 
(SSRS) assessment.

• an improvement in severity from baseline 
(Day 1 vi sit) of at least 2 levels of severity 
in the CR -PCSS as assessed live by the 
Investigator, and  
• an improvement in severity from baseline 
of at least 2  levels of severity in the 
PR-PCSS as assessed by the subject while 
viewing the digital image of the same buttock.  
A subject will be considered a responder if these criteria are met in the left buttock or right buttock or both buttocks in that subject.  The primary endpoint is the proportion of 2-level composite responders at Day 71 defined as subjects with:  
• an improvement in severity from baseline (Day 1 visit) of at least 2 levels of severity 
in the CR -PCSS as assessed live by the 
Investigator of the target buttock, and  
• an improvement in severity from baseline 
of at least 2  levels of severity in the 
PR-PCSS as assessed by the subject while 
viewing the digital image of the target 
buttock.

13.1.2.5 Subject 
Self-Rating Scale 
(SSRS)  Added section 13.1.2.5. Subject Self -Rating Scale (SSRS)  
The SSRS is a measure that assesses subject satisfaction with appearance in association with cellulite on the buttocks using whole numbers on a 7- level scale that ranges from 0 
(extremely dissatisfied) to 6 (extremely satisfied). The patient will be asked to respond to the question related to the satisfaction with appearance of the cellulite on their buttocks on the appropriate visit day (note Day 71 question is different than Day 1 question). No 
photographs or reference to previous ratings or 
evaluations w ill be used. Subjects will be 
given a list of responses and they will provide a rating from those below that best represents their answer (Table 7); the list of responses is the same for Day 1 and for Day 71.  
On Day 1 (Baseline), subjects will be instructe d to answer: Considering your 
appearance in association with your cellulite on your buttocks, how satisfied do you feel with your appearance at the present time?  
On Day 71, subjects will be instructed to answer:  Considering your appearance in 
association w ith your cellulite on your 
buttocks, how satisfied do you feel with your appearance at the present time whether or not in your judgment it is due entirely to treatment 
with EN3835?  
This variable will be entered directly into the 
EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.

14.6.1 Adverse 
Events of Special Interest  Adverse events such as bruising, ecchymosis, hematomas, and contusions that occur remote to the site of drug administration, or any  
hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, will be recorded as an AE or 
SAE as appropriate (see section 14.1.1, 
Adverse Events or section 14.1.2, Serious Adverse Events).  Adverse events such as bruising, ecchymosis, hematomas, and contusions that occur remote to the site of drug administration, or any hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, will be recorded and evaluated 
for seriousness and severity (see section 
14.1.1, Adverse Events or section 14.1.2, Serious Adverse Events).  
In addition, local AE s associated with the 
injection site, including bruising, pain, nodules/mass, ulceration, erythema, pruritus, 
swelling, and/or induration, will be recorded 
and evaluated for seriousness and severity (see as appropriate, section 14.1.1, Adverse Events 
or section 14.1.2, Serious Adverse Events)  
17.1 Determination of Sample Size  The primary variable is the proportion of 2-level composite responders at Day 71 defined as subjects with at least one of two treated 
buttocks with:  
• an improvement in seve rity from baseline 
(Day 1 visit) of at least 2 levels of severity 
in the CR -PCSS as assessed live by the 
Investigator, and  
• an improvement in severity from baseline 
of at least 2  levels of severity in the 
PR-PCSS as assessed by the subject while 
viewing the digital image of the same 
buttock.  
A subject will be considered a responder if 
these criteria are met in either the left buttock 
or right buttock or both buttocks in that subject. In other words, a subject will be considered a responder if she has an improvement of at least 2 levels on the PR -
PCSS and an improvement of at least 2  levels 
on the CR -PCSS on that same buttock; that 
buttock could be the left buttock or right buttock or both buttocks.  The primary variable is the proportion of 2-level composite  responders at Day 71 defined 
as subjects with:  
• an improvement in severity from baseline (Day 1 visit) of at least 2 levels of severity in the CR -PCSS as assessed live by the 
Investigator of the target buttock, and   
• an improvement in severity from baseline  
of at least 2  levels of severity in the 
PR-PCSS as assessed by the subject while 
viewing the digital image of the target buttock.  
A subject will be considered a responder if these criteria are met in the randomized target 
buttock of that subject

mITT subjects without any major protocol deviation that will impact the subject’s 
efficacy and safety.  The per -protocol population is defined as the 
mITT subjects without any of the following:  
• Placebo -assigned subject receives EN3835 
treatment  
• EN3835- assigned subject receives placebo

Scale (PR -CIS)  
At the Day 1 visit and Day 71 visit, subjects will be instructed to answer 6 questions related to the areas selected for treatment on their 
buttocks on the Patient Reported Cellulite 
Impact Scale (Appendix D)  while viewing 
digital images of their buttocks . The PR -CIS 
assesses the visual and emotional impact of cellulite (happy, bothered, self -consci ous, 
embarrassed, looking older or looking 
overweight or out of shape) using a 6 -question 
survey, with each question rated on a 
numerical rating scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 
(extremely).

13.1. 2.6 Hexsel 
Cellulite Severity 
Scale 13.1.2.6.  Hexsel Cellulite Severity Scale  
The Hexsel Cellulite Severity Scale (referred to as the Hexsel CSS) is a photonumeric scale that looks at 5 key morphologic features of cellulite: (A) number of evident depressions, 
(B) depth of depressions, (C) morphological 
appearance of skin surface alterations, (D) laxity, flaccidity or sagging of skin, and (E) current classification scale based on medical literature including Nürnberger and Müller.(12,13) Each of these features is 
evaluated on a 4 -point scale from a low of 0 to 
a high of 3 as described in Table 8. The total 
score is the summation of all 5 features (Appendix D).  
The Investigator or qualified designee will independently use the Hexsel CSS to assess 
the severity of EFP in each of the two buttocks 
at the Screening visit and each of  the two 
buttocks on Day 1 (Note: In this study, the Hexsel CSS is used exclusively for assessment of subject eligibility; it is not used as an 
efficacy assessment). All cellulite assessments 
should be made while the subject is in the standing position wit h relaxed gluteus 
muscles. However, when evaluating the subject for Category E (classification scale by Nürnberger and Müller) (13) if the subject has 
no evident depressions, the subject should be 
asked to contract her gluteus muscles or the pinch test should be applied (by pinching the skin between the thumb and index finger) so the Investigator or qualified designee can differentiate between scores/grades of zero (0) 
or I. 
This variable will be entered directly into the 
EDC system, thus the electronic dat abase will 
serve as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.

Name of Sponsor/Company : Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
Name of Investigational Product : EN3835 
Name of Active Ingredient : Collagenase clostridium histolyticum  
Title of Study : A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of EN3835 in the 
Treatment of Edematous Fibrosclerotic Panniculopathy 
Lead Principal Investigator:  
Study Period :  
Estimated date first subject enrolled:  Feb-2018 
Estimated date last subject completed:  Oct-2018 Phase of Development : 3 
Objectives :  
To assess the efficacy and safety of EN3835 in the treatment of edematous fibrosclerotic panniculopathy 
(EFP), commonly known as cellulite, in adult women  
Study Design: This study is a Phase 3 randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled study of the 
efficacy and safety of EN3835 in the treatment of EFP in adult women. Subjects will be screened for 
study eligibility within 14 days prior to enrolling in this study. Subjects with 2  treatment areas (bilateral 
buttocks) (also referred to as quadrants) with  moderate or severe levels of cellulite as independently 
assessed by the subject using the Patient Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (PR -PCSS) 
and by the I nvestigator using the Clinician Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR -PCSS)  
will be eligible. The eligibility of the butto cks will be confirmed on Day 1. 
Once the eligibility of the buttocks is confirmed, subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment 
group (EN3835 0.84 mg per buttock or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio within an inves tigational site. Each 
subject will receive a treatment course which consists of up to 3 treatment visits (sessions), separated by 21 days (ie, Days 1, 22, and 43). Each treatment visit will consist of 12 injections (0.3 mL per injection 
of EN3835 0.07 mg/injection or placebo; 0.84 mg in 3.6 mL per buttock) in each of the two buttocks for 
a total volume of 7.2 mL (1.68 mg). Selection of dimples to be treated in the buttocks will be at the discretion of the Investigator. End of study will occur at study day 71. Of the two assigned eligible 
buttocks, one buttock will be randomly selected as the target buttock for the primary efficacy endpoint. 
The other ( remaining) buttock will be considered the non -target buttock. Subjects, investigators, site 
personnel, and E ndo personnel will be blinded to the identification of the target and non- target buttocks. 
At each treatment visit, each of the buttocks will be photographed before and after marking dimples and injection sites while the subject is in a consistent , standar dized  relaxed standing pose. The subject will 
assess the digital photographic image (pre-marking) of each of the buttocks using the PR- PCSS to 
determine the severity of EFP in each of the buttocks. In addition, the subject will evaluate each of the 
buttock s using a Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (S -GAIS). Subsequently, the Investigator  
will conduct live assessments of each buttock using the CR -PCSS. At Day 1, the subject will complete a 
Patient Reported Cellulite Impact Scale ( PR-CIS) assessment  and a Subject Self -Rating  Scale (SSRS)  
assessment . The subject assessments will always be completed prior to and independently of the 
Investigator assessments at each treatment visit. In addition, the Investigator  will assess each of the 
buttocks using an Investigator Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (I- GAIS). All of the assessments 
must be done before the dimple marking. 
At Day 71 (End of Study/Early Termination), photographs of each of the buttocks will be taken and 
evaluated by subject using the PR -PCSS. The Investigator  will conduct live assessments of each of the

Name of Active Ingredient : Collagenase clostridium histolyticum  
Safety : 
Safety will be assessed throughout the study through the recording of: 
• Adverse events (AEs) (including those of special interest (AESI); which are AE s such as 
bruising, ecchymosis, hematomas, and contusions that occur remote to the site of drug 
administration, or any hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis; and local AE s 
associated with the injection site, including bruising, pain, nodules/mass, ulceration, erythema, pruritus, swelling, and/or induration) 
• Vital signs  
• Clinical laboratory tests  
• Immunogenicity assessment (ie, assessed through the determination of binding and neutralizing anti- AUX -I and anti- AUX -II antibody levels) 
In addition, for subjects treated with study drug in this study, injection site reactions/local tolerability in 
the treated buttocks (through subject and Investigator reporting) will be assessed. 
Statistical Methods: 
The primary endpoint is the proportion of 2- level composite responders at Day 71 defined as subjects 
with:  
• an improvement in severity from baseline (Day 1 visit) of at least 2 levels of severity in the 
CR-PCSS as assessed live by the Investigator  of the target buttock, and 
• an improvement in severity from baseline of at least 2  levels of severity in the PR -PCSS as 
assessed by the subject while viewing the digital image of the target buttock.  
A subject will be considered a responder if these criteria are met in the randomized target buttock  of that 
subject . 
Sample Size Consideration : The results of a prior Phase 2b study of this drug (Study EN3835-201) 
demonstrated the overall rate for treated buttocks of composite responders with an improvement of at 
least 2 levels on both the PR- PCSS and the CR -PCSS was 14.9% in the EN3835 treatment group versus 
1.1% in the Placebo group. Given this result, the study is planned to randomize 420 subjects with a  
1:1 ratio into either the EN3835 arm (0.84 mg/buttock, 1.68 mg total dose) or placebo arm. 
The sample size calculation was based on the following assumptions: 1)  
 
2) Fisher exact test; 3) type I error of 0.05; 4) power of at least 90%; and 
5) dropout rate of approximately 10%.  
This sample size will also provide >90% power with type 1 error of 0.05 to detect the treatment 
difference for  all the key secondary endpoints based on previous study results.  
Analysis Populations : 
• The intent -to-treat (ITT) population: The ITT population is defined as all randomized 
subjects who have received at least 1 injection of study medication. 
• Modified intent- to-treat (mITT) population: The mITT population is defined as all  
intent- to-treat subjects with a baseline and 1 post-injection evaluation of both the CR- PCSS 
and PR-PCSS for each buttock.

• Safety population: The Safety population is defined as all subjects who have received at 
least 1 injection of study medication.  
• Per-Protocol population: The Per-Protocol population is defined as those mITT subjects 
who do not have any major protocol deviations. 
Analyses:  
Analyses of Primary Endpoint: 
The primary endpoint is the proportion of 2- level composite responders at Day 71 defined as subjects 
with:  
• an improvement in severity from baseline (Day 1 visit) of at least 2 levels of severity in the CR-PCSS as assessed live by the Investigator  of the target buttock, and 
• an improvement in severity from baseline of at least 2  levels of severity in the PR -PCSS as 
assessed by the subject while viewing the digital image of the target buttock.  
A subject will be considered a responder if these criteria are met in the randomized target buttock  of that 
subject . 
The primary endpoint will be summarized as percentages and analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test that compares the 2 treatment groups and adjusts for Investigator at a level of significance of 0.05. The ITT population will be evaluated for the primary endpoint with any subject not having an evaluation of CR- PCSS and/or PR- PCSS at Day 71 classified as a non -responder. 
Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint will include:  
• ITT su bjects with missing data handled by multiple imputation (MI) approach 
• ITT subjects with missing data handled by a last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
approach  
• mITT subjects with missing data handled by an LOCF approach  
• Observed data only (no missing data imputed) 
• Per-protocol (PP) subjects with missing data handled by an LOCF approach if 10% or more 
subjects are excluded in the PP population from mITT population. 
Analyses of Key Secondary Endpoints :  
There will be 8 key secondary endpoints grouped as three  families of 2  to 4 endpoints per family 
analyzed in hierarchical order. 
• Family #1 – four endpoints: 
- Proportion of 1- level PR -PCSS responders defined as subjects with ≥1- level 
improvement in PR- PCSS severity rating of the target buttock  at Day 71 compared to 
Day 1  
- Proportion of 2- level PR -PCSS responders defined as subjects with ≥ 2-level 
improvement in PR- PCSS severity rating of target buttock at Day 71 compared to Day 1

- Proportion of 1- level S -GAIS responders defined as subjects with ≥1- level improvement 
(improved, much improved or very much improved) in the S- GAIS assessment of the 
target buttock at Day 71  
- Proportion of 2- level S -GAIS responders defined as subjects with ≥2- level improvement 
(much improved or very much improved) in the S- GAIS assessment of the target buttock 
at Day 71  
The key secondary efficacy analyses will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary endpoint based 
on the ITT population. The family #1 key secondary efficacy analyses will be performed only if the 
primary efficacy analysis is significant at a significance level of p ≤ 0.05 (gatekeeping strategy). 
Similarly, family #2 key secondary efficacy analyses will be performed only if at least one of the key 
secondary efficacy endpoints of family #1 is significant at a significance level of p  ≤ 0.0125 and 
family  #3 key secondary efficacy analyses will be performed only if at least one of the key secondary 
efficacy endpoints of family #2 is significant (parallel gatekeeping strategy). Within a family of key 
secondary efficacy endpoints, the Bonferroni method will be  performed to relocate unused alpha for 
testing each endpoint to assure an overall error rate of p ≤ 0.05. The details of the testing procedures will 
be provided in the statistical analysis plan for the study.

• AEs: Mapped to preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA)  
• Vital signs  
• Clinical laboratory tests  
AEs will be summarized by proportion of subjects reporting each event. The Fisher  exact test will be 
used to compare EN3835 to placebo. Descriptive statistics will be presented for actual and change from baseline at each visit for vital signs and for each clinical laboratory test parameter. The comparison 
between treatment groups will be based on the change from baseline for clinical laboratory tests and 
vital signs using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a factor of drug (EN3835 or placebo). 
Immunogenicity : Anti -AUX -I and anti- AUX -II antibody levels will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics for the actual value at the visit. Samples from Day 1, Day 22, Day 43, and Day 71 visits will be 
analyzed for anti -AUX -I and anti- AUX -II antibodies and a subset of Day 1 and Day 71 samples will be 
analyzed for neutralizing antibodies.

   8. INTRODUCTION 
8.1. Background  
8.1.1. Edematous Fibrosclerotic Panniculopathy  
Edematous fibrosclerotic panniculopathy (EFP), commonly known as cellulite, has been defined 
as a local metabolic disorder of subcutaneous tissues that results in a contour abnormality of the skin.(1)  The condition manifests as dimpled skin, particularly in the gluteal -femoral region. (2,3) 
EFP is caused by herniation of subcutaneous fat lobules through the dermohypodermal junction and/or shortening of the collagen septa that cross the hypodermal layer and connects the dermis 
to the underlying fascia. This creates an uneven surface with dimpling.(1,2 ) EFP is a medical 
condition resulting in a potentially cosmetically unacceptable alteration of the skin, and affects an estimated 85% to 98% of postpubertal women.( 1,3) 
The pathophysiology of EFP is not completely understood, but t here are 3 main theories: edema 
resulting from excessive hydrophilia of the intercellular matrix, alteration of the regional microcirculation, and different anatomical conformation of collagenous subcutaneous tissues in women versus men.(4 ) 
It is known that EFP is different from generalized obesity. In generalized obesity, adipocytes undergo hypertrophy and hyperplasia that are not limited to the pelvis, thighs, and abdomen.(1 ) 
In areas of EFP, adipocytes have physiologic and biochemical properties that differ from adipose 
tissue located elsewhere.  Large, metabolically -stable adipocytes characterize EFP -prone areas; 
thus, the responsiveness to catecholamine-induced lipolysis is less in EFP tissues compared to 
visceral fat, which has the greatest responsiveness. (1) 
Subcutaneous fat lobes are separated from one another by thin, usually rigid strands of collagenous connective tissues, which cross the fatty layers and connect the dermis to the underlying fascia. These septa stabilize the subcutis and divide the fat. In EFP, shortening of the 
collagen septa due to fibrosis provokes retraction at the insertion points of the trabeculae, 
causing the depressions that characterize EFP. (2) There are a higher percentage of thinner, 
perpendicular hypodermal septa in women with EFP than in men.(1) Weight gain makes EFP 
more noticeable, but it may be present even in thin subjects. Genetics may also play a role sinc e 
EFP tends to run in families.  
8.1.2. Current EFP Treatments  
There are therapies that have been utilized in an attempt to treat cellulite; however, there are no approved pharmacologic treatments. Despite multiple therapeutic modalities, there is little 
scientific evidence that any of these treatments are beneficial. In fact, much of the evidence is anecdotal, subjective, or based only on patient self- assessment. (5) Some of the historical 
treatments for EFP have included weight loss,(6)  topical agents ,(5) massage, (7) liposuction,(5,6) 
mesotherapy ,(6) radiofrequency,(6)  subcision and powered subcision,(8) and laser 
therapies ;(9,10) some of these treatments may pose an increased risk for adverse effects. (5)

   There remains an unmet medical need for safe and effective therapies to improve the aesthetic 
outcome in women with cellulite. To effectively treat cellulite, a therapeutic approach may 
require disruption of the dermal septa, which are composed of collagen and cause the skin 
dimpling th at is bothersome to many women. 
8.1.3. EN3835 (Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum) 
Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Endo) is developing EN3835 for the treatment of EFP. Because 
EN3835 is a proteinase that can hydrolyze the triple- helical region of collagen under 
physiological conditions, EN3835 has the potential to be effective in lysing subdermal collagen, 
such as those observed in the dermal septa, which are the underlying cause of the skin dimpling 
in women with EFP. EN3835 targets the collagenase structural matrix (eg, dermal septa) at the 
site of injection and does not require systemi c exposure to be effective.  
EN3835 is a parenteral lyophilized product comprised of 2 collagenases in an approximate 1:1 
mass ratio, Collagenase I (AUX -I, Clostridial class I collagenase) and Collagenase II (AUX -II; 
Clostridial class II collagenase). These collagenases are isolated and purified from the 
fermentation of Clostridium histolyticum . 
Collagenase AUX -I is a single polypeptide chain containing approximately 1,000 amino acids of 
known sequence and with a molecular weight of 114 kDa. Collagenase AUX- II is also 
approximately 1,000 amino acids long and has a molecular weight of 113 kDa. These 
2 collagenases are not immunologically cross -reactive and have different specificities, such that 
together they become synergistic, providing a very broad hydrolyzing reactivity toward collagen. 
Clostridial collagenases are proteinases that can hydrolyze the triple-helical region of collagen 
under physiological cond itions.  
EN3835 is currently approved (brand name is XIAFLEX®) for: 1) the treatment of adults with 
Dupuytren’s contracture with a palpable cord and, 2) for the treatment of adult men with Peyronie’s disease with a palpable plaque and curvature deformity of at least 30 ° at the start of 
therapy.  
A recent Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (EN3835-201) of 375 women randomized to treatment of one treatment area (quadrant) (quadrant was defined in 
study EN3835-201 as a left buttock, a right buttock, a left posterolateal thigh or a right posterolateral thigh) of cellulite with EN3835 0.84 mg or placebo in a 1:1 ratio assessed the 
effectiveness and safety of EN3835. Efficacy in this study was evaluated based on cellulite 
assessments using Clinician Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR -PCSS), Patient 
Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (PR -PCSS), Investigator Global Aesthetic 
Improvement Scale (GAIS -I), Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS -S), and 
Subject  Satisfaction with Cellulite Treatment.  
Results from the Phase 2b study demonstrated that treatment (3 visits approximately 21 days 
apart) improved the cellulite severity of the treatment area as assessed by the primary endpoint of 
2-level composite responder analyses, the proportion of responders based on an improvement of ≥2 levels in the appearance of cellulite in both the patient PR -PCSS and the clinician CR -PCSS 
of buttocks and thighs was statistically significantly greater in subjects who received EN3 835 
0.84 mg (10.6%; p <0.001) compared to subjects who received placebo (1.6%); 1- level (or 
greater) responders in the PR-PCSS of EN3835- treated subjects (72.3%) was significantly 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 2 
16-Jan-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 56 
   greater than 1 -level responders in the pl acebo group (51.6%) ( p<0.001); stati stically significant 
(p≤0.001) improvement in the appearance of cellulite based on the subject S -GAIS were 
observed in EN3835 0.84- mg group (73.1%) compared to the placebo group (44.0%); and 62.9% 
of subjects in the EN3835 0.84 mg group were satisfied or very satisfied with the results of their 
cellulite treatment compared with only 35.9% of subjects in the placebo group ( p<0.001). In 
subjects treated in buttocks (n=187), the proportion of 2-level composite responders was statistically significantly greate r in subjects who received EN3835 0.84 mg (14.9%; p<0.001) 
compared to subjects who received placebo (1.1%); 1-level (or greater) responders in the 
PR-PCSS of EN3835- treated subjects (72.7%) was significantly greater than 1- level responders 
in the placebo group (47.8%) ( p<0.001). 
The study also demonstrated EN3835 to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events (SAEs) related to EN3835. Safety results from a total of 4 studies (1 pilot, 2 Phase 1, and 2 Phase 2 
studies) in which 435 adult females received subcutaneous injections of EN3835 indicate that the majority of treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) are transient, non-serious, mild or 
moderate in intensity, and related to the local administration of EN3835. The immunogenicity profile after 3 treatment visits of EN3835 indicate that greater than 90% of EN3835- treated 
subjects were seropositive for AUX-I and/or AUX-II antibodies; this profile of EN3835 is 
similar to that observed in the Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease programs. 
A Ph ase 1, open-label safety and pharmacokinetic study of a single dose of EN3835 0.84 mg in 
11 female subjects with EFP showed that there was no quantifiable levels of AUX- I or AUX -II 
at any time  point after subcutaneous injection of EN3835 0.84 mg into one quadrant. A second 
Phase 1, open-label safety and pharmacokinetic study of a single dose of EN3835 0.84 mg per 
treatment area in two treatment areas (buttock -buttock, thigh-thigh, or buttock- thigh) 
concurrently (total dose of 1.68 mg) showed that there was no quantifiable levels of AUX- I or 
AUX- II at any time  point post-dose attributable  to the injection of EN3835 1.68 mg.  
The results from these studies suggest that subcutaneous injections of EN3835 in the area of 
cellulite may be a well- tolerated and effective medical  treatment for adults with EFP.  
8.2. Summary of Nonclinical Studies  
Non-clinical studies necessary to support clinical studies have been performed and are 
summarized in the Investigator Brochure (IB).( 11) Non -clinical studies in the following areas 
were performed: toxicology, reprotoxicity, genotoxicity, and hypersensitivity. 
8.3. Summary of Known Risks and Benefits  
A summary of safety risks is provided in the IB.( 11) The following events have been commonly 
observed: local injection site reactions (injection site bruising, injection site swelling, injection 
site pain) for the various approved indications as well as those being investigated. In the phase 
2b study of EN3835 in women with EFP, the following treatment related adverse events ≥2% of 
189 EN3835- treated women were reported: injectio n site bruising (75.1%), injection site pain 
(59.3%), injection site nodule (14.3%), injection site pruritus (11.1%), injection site swelling 
(7.4%), injection site induration (5.8%), injection site mass (5.3%), injection site discolouration 
(3.2%), and injection site erythema (2.1%). These events are similar to events reported in the clinical trials of EN3835 for the approved indications. Postmarket ing safety data are consistent 
with safety data reported in clinical trials.

   Although a thorough benefit of EN3835 has not been fully evaluated in the treatment of EFP, the 
efficacy results from the Phase 2b study and previous EFP studies warranted further 
development. 
8.4. Rationale  
The results from the Phase 2b EFP study (EN3835-201) further suggested that EN3835 0.84 mg 
per treatment area (quadrant) is an effective treatment of EFP based on improvement in the 
severity of cellulite as determined by the Investigator and the subject. There were no safety 
concerns following 0.84 mg per treatment area in the treatment of  EFP ( section  8.1.3). Safety 
findings from the Phase 2b EFP study are similar to that observed in previous clinical studies 
with EN3835 in the treatment of EFP and XIAFLEX in the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture 
and Peyronie’s disease, in that that the majority of AEs occurred at the site of injection and resolved before the next scheduled treatment. The immunogenicity profile of EN3835 in the 
Phase 2b EFP study is similar in previous studies and programs. 
Based on the efficacy and safety findings from the Phase 2a and 2b EFP studies, the EN3835 
0.84- mg dose per treatment area in two treatment areas (buttocks) warranted further investigation 
in this study.  
Treating two buttocks at each treatment visit will potentially provide a symmetrical-l ike 
improvement in appearance. Support for evaluation of the treatment of two buttocks concurrently 
is based on: 1) the safety findings from the previous EFP st udies are local to the injection site, 
2) the pharmacological activity of EN3835 is local and does not require systemic exposure, and 
3) no significant quantifiable systemic concentration has been attributable to injection of two 
buttocks concurrently. 
The integration of dose and use justification supports this study of evaluation of EN3835 
0.84 mg per treatment area in two treatment areas (buttocks) concurrently.

10.2. Selection of Doses  
The dose of EN3835 chosen for this study was based on the results from earlier studies.  
The data from the Phase 2a EFP dose- ranging study (AUX -CC-831) suggest that EN3835 
0.84 mg is most effective in the treatment of EFP based on improvement in the severity of 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 2 
16-Jan-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 60 
   cellulite as determined by both the Investigator and the subject, although the EN3835 0.48- mg 
group did show improvement in s ome of the efficacy paramete rs. 
• There were no safety concerns following administration of up to 3 treatment visits of 
EN3835 0.84 mg in the treatment of EFP (AUX- CC-831 CSR). The safety profile of 
EN3835 0.84 mg in the treatment of EFP was similar to that observed in the EN3835 0.06-mg group and the EN3835 0.48-mg group. No notable differences were observed across the 3 treatment groups. 
• Safety findings from the Phase 2a EFP dose- ranging study are similar to that 
observed in previous clinical studies with XIAFLEX in the treatment of D upuytren’s 
contracture and Peyronie’s disease, in that the majority of AEs occurred at the site of injection and resolved before the next scheduled treatment. 
• The immunogenicity profile of EN3835 in the Phase 2a EFP dose- ranging study is 
similar to that ob served in the Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease 
programs. 
• Based on the efficacy and safety findings from the Phase 2a EFP dose- ranging study, 
the EN3835 0.84-mg dose was carried forward to the Phase 2b study. 
The results from the Phase 2b EFP study (EN3835 -201) further suggested that EN3835 0.84 mg 
is an effective treatment of EFP based on improvement in the severity of cellulite as determined by the Investigator and the subject . There were no safety concerns following EN3835 0.84 mg 
in the treatment of EFP ( section  8.4). Safety findings from the Phase 2b EFP study are similar to 
that observed in previous clinical studies with XIAFLEX in the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease, in tha t that the majority of AEs occurred at the site of 
injection and resolved before the next scheduled treatment. The immunogenicity profile of 
EN3835 in the Phase 2b EFP study is similar to that observed in the Dupuytren’s contracture 
and Peyronie’s disease programs. 
Based on the efficacy and safety findings from the Phase 2a and 2b EFP studies, the EN3835 
0.84- mg dose per treatment area was carried forward to this study . The findings from previous 
studies that the majority of adverse events after EN3835 trea tment are local to the injection site 
and that there is no quantifiable systemic exposure observed after concurrent treatment of two buttocks (total dose of 1.68 mg) supports the proposed study to evaluate EN3835 treatment of 
two buttocks. 
10.3. Study Drug Administration  
Study drug will be injected subcutaneously while the subject is in a prone position using a 
syringe with a 30 -gauge ½ -inch needle. Each injection site will receive a single skin injection of 
study drug administered as three 0.1-mL aliquots to Positions A, B, and C (for a total injection 
volume of 0.3 mL) as shown in the following figure. The depth of injection corresponds to the 
length of the treatment needle (0.5 inches) from the tip of the needle to the hub or base of the 
needle without downward pressure.  
During each treatment visit, 8 syringes (4 syringes per buttock) will be prepared for dosing. Each 
syringe will contain 0.9 mL of study drug (ie, 3 injections in each syringe). Twelve (12) skin

   10.4. Care Procedures After Injection  
To evaluate the subject for possible immediate immunological AEs, the subject will remain in 
direct observation of medical personnel who are skilled in the management of an allergic 
reaction for 30 minutes after receiving the injection s of study drug and until the subject exhibits 
no sign of an immunological or other clinically significant systemic or local AE. The subject’s 
vital signs should be stable before the subject can leave direct observation (see s ection  14.9).  
The Investigator or qualified designee will then apply a sterile dressing to the injection areas with hypoallergenic tape. The subject will be instructed to remove the dressing in the eveni ng. 
10.5. Discussion of Study Design, Including the Choice of Control Groups  
The design of this study was based on the primary objective to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EN3835 0.84 mg per buttock in the concurrent treatment (total dose of 1.68 mg) of 2 bi lateral 
buttocks with EFP in adult women compared with placebo treatment. The study design, a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is in accordance with regulatory guidelines of adequate and well -controlled clinical studies ( Food and Drug A dministration [ FDA ] Guidance 
for Industry: Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological 
Products, 1998.; ICH E8 and E10).

11.3. Subject Discontinuation Criteria  
A premature discontinuation will occur when a subject who signed informed consent ceases participation in the study, regardless of circumstances, prior to the completion of the protocol. Subjects can be prematurely discontinued from the study for one of the following reasons: 
• An adverse event  
• Lack of efficacy  
• A protocol violation (reason must be specified, for exa mple: lack of compliance, use 
of a prohibited concomitant medication, failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria after study entry, etc) 
• Withdrawal by subject (reason must be specified) 
• The subject was “lost to follow -up” 
• Other reasons (reason must be specified, for example: the subject moved, pregnancy, 
Investigator decision, Sponsor decision to terminate trial, etc) 
If a subject discontinues from the study, all end-of-study procedures including safety and 
efficacy assessments should be conducted as detailed in the Schedule of Events (section  5). The 
date a subject discontinues and the reason for discontinuation will be recorded in the source 
documentation and electronic case report form  (eCRF). If, however, a subject withdraws consent, 
no end-of-study procedures and assessments are required (but are encouraged to reduce missing 
information) except the collection of adverse event (AE) information. This information should be 
recorded in the source documentation and the eCRF. 
11.3.1. Replacement Procedures  
Subjects who discontinue from the study will not be replaced.

   12. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
12.1. Study Visits 
The Schedule of Events to be performed at each visit is shown in section 5. Provided below are 
further details where additional instruction about the assessments that will be performed is 
deemed to be needed.  
12.1.1. Informed Consent  
Signed and dated informed consent will be obtained from each subject before any study procedures are undertaken, or before any changes to the subject’s medication regimen are made. Details about how the informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in 
section  21.3, Subject Information and Consent. 
12.1.2. Subject Screening  
Investigators will be expected to maintain a Screening log of all potential study subjects. This log 
will include limited information about the potential subject and the date and outcome of the 
screening process (eg, enrolled into the study, reason for ineligibility, or refused to participate). 
Investigators will provide information about the study to subjects who appear to meet the criteria for participation in the study. The screening log will be captured directly by the electronic data 
capture ( EDC ) system.  
12.1.2.1. Medical History  
During the screening period, the Investigator or qualified designee will obtain a medical history 
from each subject that includes relevant diagnoses and/or procedures/therapies with 
onset/resolutions dates. Medical histories should also include history of EFP (start date and 
family history), and history of tobacco and alcohol use (never, current, former). 
12.1.2.2. Screening Period (Day -14 to Day -1) 
Subjects meeting the relevant eligibility criteria listed in section  11 may be enrolled in the study 
after the nature and purpo se of the protocol have been explained and written informed consent to 
participate has been voluntarily provided by the subject or their legally authorized representative.  
The subject identification number will consist of 8 digits. The first 4 digits repre sent the study 
site number follow ed by a 4 -digit subject number. 
The following procedures will be performed and documented during the screening period: 
1. Obtain written informed consent (s ection  12.1.1) 
2. Evaluate eligibility based on inclusion/exclusion crite ria (section  11.1 and s ection  11.2) 
3. Subject will have digital photographs taken of her two buttocks (s ection  13.1.1) 
4. Subjects will get instruction on the use of the PR- PCSS (s ection  13.1.2.1) 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 2 
16-Jan-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 67 
   5. Prior to  Investigator  CR- PCSS assessment, subjects will rate each of their two  buttocks 
using the PR- PCSS while viewing their digital images ( section  13.1.2.1); the Investigator 
is blinded to these ratings  
6. After the subject has completed the PR -PCSS rating s, the Investigator will conduct live 
assessments of subject’s cellulite severity of each of the two  buttocks using the CR- PCSS 
(section  13.1.2.6); the subject is blinded to these ratings . The ratings from the PR- PCSS 
and CR-PCSS will be used to assess initial eligibility o f the buttocks for study entry 
7. Medical history including EFP history ( section  12.1.2.1)  
8. Record prior and concomitant medications/procedures (s ection  12.8) 
9. Physical exami nation including measurement of body weight, height, Fitzpatrick skin 
type ( section  14.11) 
10. Vital sign measurements ( section  14.9) 
11. 12-lead ECG ( section  14.10)  
12. Collection of samples for: 
a. Clinical laboratory testing ( section  14.7) 
b. Serum pregna ncy testing ( section  14.7) 
13. Adverse events ( section  14) 
12.2. Selecting and Marking Dimples during Treatment Visits  
Selection of dimples to be treated in the two buttocks is at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Dimples must be well-defined and evident when the subject is standing in a consistent, 
standardized  relaxed pose (without the use of any manipulation such as skin pinching or muscle 
contraction). Each subject will receive 3 treatment visits of study drug according to 
randomization unless the buttock is dimple- free (score of 0 on CR -PCSS as r eported by the 
Investigator) at Treatment Visit 2 and /or Treatment Visit 3 (a dimple - free buttock at Treatment 
Visit 1 is precluded by the eligibility criteria ); a dimple -free buttock at Treatment Visit 2 and /or 
Treatment Visit 3 does not preclude treatment of the contralateral buttock unless it is dimple -free 
also. During each treatment visit, each of the buttocks will be photographed before and after marking dimples and injection sites while the subject is standing in a consistent, standardized relaxed pose as described in the Photography Manual. The cellulite severity assessments using 
the PR -PCSS  and CR- PCSS will be completed prior to marking dimples and injection sites.  
The Investigator or qualified designee will select dimples within each buttock that are well -
defined, evident when the subject is standing, and suitable for treatment; treatment consists of 12 injections per buttock (24 injections total in two buttocks) per treatment visit. Because the 
goal of treatment is to improve the aesthetic appear ance of each entire buttock, the Investigator 
will be instructed to select dimples that in his or her opinion would most improve the aesthetic 
appearance of each entire buttock. The same dimples within a buttock or different dimples within 
a buttock may be treated at each treatment visit but injections must all be within the buttocks (12 injections per buttock) for all 3 visits. Each buttock will receive all 3  treatment visits unless 
the buttock has no treatable EFP dimples and the Investigator rates the buttock a score of 0 on the CR -PCSS. If no injections in a particular buttock (right or left) are given at Treatment 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 2 
16-Jan-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 68 
   Visit 2, subjects will still be assessed for treatment in the contralateral buttock at Treatment 
Visit 2, and will return for the Day 43 visit and each of the buttocks will again be evaluated by 
the subject (PR -PCSS) and Investigator (CR-PCSS). If the Investigator rates either or both of the 
buttocks greater than 0 on the CR- PCSS, injections at Treatment Visit 3 should be given.  
For each dimple selected for treatment, the Investigator or qualified designee will choose injection sites (injection sites within a dimple should be spaced approximately 2 cm apart, if a 
dimple requires more than 1 injection; locating at least one injection site at the nadir, if present, of the dimple). Each injection site will be marked with a “dot” using a surgical marker. For 
round dimples, the “dot” will be placed in the center of the dimple; for elongated dimples, “dots” 
will be spaced out approximately 2 cm along t he longer axis of the dimple. The Investigator or 
qualified designee will then use a surgical marker to circle each of the dimples selected for 
treatment. Circles in the buttock should not overlap. 
Each of the buttocks will be photographed before and after marking dimples and injection sites 
while the subject is standing in a consistent , standardized  relaxed pose as described in the 
Photography Manual. 
Examples of subject dimple and injection site markings are shown as follows: 
Sample Buttock Marking  
 
12.3. Digital Photography during Treatment Visits 1, 2, and 3  
During each treatment visit, each of the two buttocks will be photographed before and after 
marking dimples and injections sites while the subject is standing in a consistent, standardized 
relaxed pose as described in s ection  13.1.1.

If any subject needs to return to the site prior to her next scheduled visit, site staff should follow 
the Unscheduled Visit procedures outlined in section 5.  Site staff may conduct additional study 
procedures if required. 
12.8. Prior and Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
All prior medications taken within 90 days before randomization will be recorded. All medications (including over-the-counter medications) taken by the subject on Day 1 through the end of the study must be recorded. Any prior treatments (medications or procedures) for EFP 
through the end of the study must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. 
Additionally, any diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedures performed during the study 
period should be recorded including the date, indication for and description of the procedure. 
12.8.1. Prohibited Medications or Procedures  
The following medications are prohibited for randomized subjects during the study: 
anticoagulants (warfarin, heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors, Factor X inhibitors) and antiplatelet agents (aspirin >150 mg/day and P2Y12 inhibitors, such as clopidogrel), which can cause 
additional bruising. However the use of as pirin at a dose level of ≤150 mg per day will be 
permitted during study. 
Procedures listed in exclusion criterion #4 (section 11.2, Exclusion Criterion #4) are prohibited 
for randomized subjects during the study. 
Table 4: Concomitant Medication Restrictions for Subjects d uring the Treatment 
Phase of Study  
Drug Class  Restrictions  
Anticoagulants  Subjects cannot take antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants (except for 
≤150 mg aspirin daily) within 7  days before and 7 days after the dosing 
administration.  
12.9. Treatment Compliance  
Randomized subjects will receive study drug administered by an Investigator at the 
Investigator ’s site.  
Accidental or intentional overdoses should be reported to the Sponsor/designee promptly (see 
section  14.6.2.1, Overdose). 
12.10.  Blinding and Randomization  
On Day 1, if each of the buttocks (ie , both buttocks) again meet the criteria (3 or 4 on the 
PR-PCSS and CR- PCSS) , one buttock will be randomly assigned by the IWRS as the target 
buttock for the primary efficacy endpoint. Subjects, investigators, site personnel, and Endo 
personnel will be blinded to the identification of the target buttock.  
On Day 1, if each of the buttocks (ie , both buttocks) again meet  the criteria (3 or 4 on the 
PR-PCSS and CR- PCSS), the subject will be randomized to a treatment group. The interactive 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 2 
16-Jan-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 73 
   web response system  (IWRS) will randomly assign each subject to a treatment group (EN3835 
0.84 mg per buttock × two buttocks or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio within an investigational site. The 
treatment group will remain blinded to the Investigator, subjects, all site personnel, and the 
sponsor. The IWRS will assign the subject study drug kit numbers associated with the randomized treatment. At Day 22 and 43 visits, the IWRS will again assign the subject study 
drug kit numbers associated with the randomized treatment assigned at Day 1.  
All precautions will be taken to ensure that the blinding of EN3835 and placebo is maintained 
throughout the s tudy period. Unblinding will not be permitted by the study site unless it is 
deemed necessary for treatment of a medical emergency. Before breaking the blind, the Investigator should make every attempt to contact the Medical Monitor to discuss the necessit y 
of breaking the blind. The study site will have the ability to immediately determine treatment 
identification in the event of an emergency by using the unblinding function within the IWRS, 
however, the Medical Monitor must be notified immediately. The Investigator will be required to make a full written explanation of the reason for unblinding the subject and the date. In the event 
that a subject is unblinded prior to contacting the Medical Monitor, the Investigator must provide 
this information in writin g to the Medical Monitor as soon as possible. Breaking the blind at the 
investigative site will immediately disqualify the subject from further participation in the study. 
In addition, the event(s) leading to emergency unblinding must be reported as a n SAE  according 
to instructions in section 14.5.2, Reporting Serious Adverse Events . 
In addition, it may be necessary for the Investigator or qualified designee to unblind a subject as a result of a clinically significant finding noted during safety review by the Investigator, Safety 
Monitor, Medical Monitor and/or qualified designee that might jeopardize subject safety.

   13. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
13.1. Efficacy Measurements  
13.1.1. Digital Photography  
Although digital photographs are not direct efficacy measurements, digital photography will be 
utilized in the assessment of certain efficacy measurements ie to  assess certain cellulite severity 
parameters at specific intervals (see section  5, Schedule of Events) . At the Screening  visit, the 
Investigator or qualified designee will photograph each buttock using a Sponsor-supplied standardized digital camera in a standardized manner. The subject will be standing for each photography session and will be wea ring a standardized photographic garment as described in 
the Photography Manual. The Investigator or qualified designee will photograph each of the two buttocks while the subject is standing in a consistent, standardized relaxed standing pose, ie, standing position with relaxed gluteus muscles, at the following time points:  
• Screening (no markings of dimples or injection s ite) - each of the two buttocks 
• Before and after marking dimples and injection sites (prior to injections) on Days 1, 22, and 43 - each of the two buttocks 
• During the Day 71 visit (end of study/early termination) (no dimple or injection site 
markings) - each of the two buttocks 
All photographs from this study are the property of Endo and may be utilized for clinical 
development, scientific communication, marketing, regulatory purposes, and/or legal 
applications as required/desired by Endo. 
13.1.2. Subject and Investigator Cellulite Assessments  
Investigator cellulite asse ssments are independent of the subject assessments. Therefore, all 
subject cellulite assessments must be completed before the Investigator’s cellulite assessments 
are initiated. The subject assessments will be done using a subject-assigned password protect ed 
electronic patient reported outcome (ePRO ) system and the Investigator and study site personnel 
will not have access to the subject’s assessments or password; the clinician assessment will be recorded in an investigator- assigned password protected system and the subject will not have 
access to the Investigator’s assessments or password. Subject assessments will be done alone 
with no study site personnel in the room. Investigators will be instructed not to verbalize their ratings while in the presence of the subject. 
13.1.2.1. Patient -Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (PR -PCSS)  
The PR -PCSS will be conducted for the purpose of assessing the severity of cellulite in the 
buttock. The scale is a 5 -level photonumeric scale developed specifically for patients and used 
by the subject to assess the severity of their cellulite in the buttocks by viewing digital images of 
each of their buttocks captured by photography at the visit; the ratings range from 0 (None) to 4 (Severe) with labels and descriptors to aid the subject in the assessments.  

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 2 
16-Jan-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 75 
   At Screening and at the beginning of their visits on Day 1, Day 22, Day 43, and Day 71, subjects 
will have digital photographs taken of each of their two buttocks. Subjects will b e given 
instructions in the proper use (Patient Instructions for Use of PR- PCSS)  of the PR- PCSS and 
then perform the PR-PCSS for each of the buttocks (Appendix B ). While viewing the digital 
images of each of their buttocks on a standardized computer monitor and using PR- PCSS for 
buttock, subjects will be instructed to answer the following question for each buttock: Today, how would you rate the severity of your cellulite in the area displayed using the PR-PCSS? The subject will be given the following explanations : Please try to match the severity of your 
cellulite, as seen in this digital image, with one of the cellulite levels on the PR -PCSS. Please 
look at the image of your cellulite and the pictures, labels, and descriptions on the PR-PCSS carefully before selecting your answer. If you feel that your cellulite level is between 2 of the 
levels, please select the level that is closest to your image. I f you feel that your cellulite is exactly 
halfway between two PR- PCSS levels of cellulite severity, please select the more severe 
response. 
The subject will enter their rating electronically into an ePRO system; the Investigator and other 
site personnel will be blinded to the rating entered by the subject. This variable will be entered 
directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve as the direct point of data 
capture and will serve as source for this variable.  
13.1.2.2. Subject Global Aesthetic  Improvement Scale (S -GAIS)  
Subjects will complete the S -GAIS for each of the buttocks as described below at the Day 22, 
Day 43, and Day 71 study visits using the pre- treatment Day 1 digital image (Baseline) of each 
of the buttocks for comparison. 
All trea ted subjects will be instructed to answer the following question for each buttock:  
How would you rate the appearance of your treated cellulite after treatment? 
The S -GAIS assessment will occur after the subject has completed the PR -PCSS assessment to 
avoid introducing potential bias to the static PR- PCSS assessment. The subject will view each of 
their pre -treatment Day 1 digital images alongside their Day 22, Day 43 or Day 71/End of study 
visit digital images of each of their buttocks to aid in the assessment (Table 5). Subjects will 
provide a rating from those below that best represents their answer for each treated buttock. 
This variable will be entered directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic d atabase will serve 
as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.

13.1.2.3. Patient Reported Cellulite Impact Scale ( PR-CIS)  
At the Day 1 visit and the Day 71 visit, subjects will be instructed to answer 6 questions related 
to the areas selected for treatment on their buttocks on the PR- CIS (Appendix D ) while viewing 
digital images of their buttocks . The PR- CIS assesses the visual and emotional impact of cellulite  
(happy, bothered, self-conscience, embarrassed, looking older, or looking overweight or out of shape) using a 6-question survey, with each question rated on a numerical rating scale from 
0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely).  
This variable will be entered directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve 
as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.  
13.1.2.4. Subject Satisfaction with Cellulite Treatment Assessment  
At the Day 71 visit, subjects will be instructed to answer a question related to their treated 
buttocks. Subjects will be given a list of responses and they will provide a rating from those 
below that best represents their answer  (Table 6) . 
Today, how satisfied are you with the results of the cellulite trea tment you received on the 
specific area or areas on your buttocks that were treated? 
This variable will be entered directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve 
as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.

   13.1.2.5. Subject Self -Rating Scale (SSRS)  
The SSRS is a measure that assesses subject satisfaction with appearance in association with 
cellulite on the buttocks using whole numbers on a 7- level scale that ranges from 0 (extremely 
dissatisfied to 6 (extremely satisf ied). The patient will be asked to respond to the question related 
to the satisfaction with appearance of the cellulite on their buttocks on the appropriate visit day (note Day 71 question is different than Day 1 question). No photographs or reference to previous 
ratings or evaluations will be used. Subjects will be given a list of responses and they will 
provide a rating from those below that best represents their answer ( Table 7); the list of 
responses is the same for Day 1 and for Day 71. 
On Day 1 (Basel ine), subjects will be instructed to answer: Considering your appearance in 
association with your cellulite on your buttocks, how satisfied do you feel with your appearance 
at the present time?  
On Day 71, subjects will be instructed to answer:  Considering your appearance in association 
with your cellulite on your buttocks, how satisfied do you feel with your appearance at the present time whether or not in your judgment it is due entirely to treatment with EN3835? 
This variable will be entered directly into  the EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve 
as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.

13.1.2.6. Clinician -Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR -PCSS)  
The CR -PCSS will be conducted for the purpose of assessing the severity of cellulite in the 
buttock. The scale is a 5 -level photonumeric scale developed specifically for clinicians and used 
by the Investigator to assess the severity of the subject’s cellulite in each buttock by live 
assessments; the ratings range from 0 (None) to 4 (Severe) with labels and descriptors to aid the 
Investigator in the assessments.  
Investigators will be trained and qualified on the use of the CR- PCSS p rior to assessing any 
subjects.  
At the Screening visit, the Investigator will determine severity of cellulite of each of the 
two buttocks via live assessment of the subject using the CR-PCSS for buttock (Appendix C ) 
after the subject has completed her self -assessment using the PR -PCSS. Before injections on 
treatment visits Day  1, Day 22, and Day 43, and on visit Day 71; Investiga tors will evaluate each 
of the two buttocks by live assessments using the CR-PCSS for the buttock to make his/her 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 2

   evaluation. At each visit, the Investigator will make his/her assessment independently and after 
the subject has conducted her self- assessment  using the PR- PCSS.  
This variable will be entered directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.  
13.1.2.7. Investigator Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (I -GAIS)  
On the Day 22, Day 43, and Day 71 study visits, the Investigator will determine the degree of 
improvement of each buttock by comparing the cellulite from the Day 1 pre- treatment (Baseline) 
digital image of each buttock to the cellulite seen in a live asse ssment ( Table 8). The I- GAIS 
assessment will occur after the CR -PCSS assessment (section  13.1.2.6) to avoid introducing 
potential bias to the static CR -PCSS assessment by the Investigator. For each buttock, the 
Investigator will provide the rating from those below that best represents his /her answer.  
This variable will be entered directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.

   14. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
14.1. Definitions 
14.1.1. Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable or unintended change in body structure (signs), body 
function (symptoms), laboratory result (eg, chemistry, ECG, X- ray, etc), or worsening of a 
pre-existing condition associated temporally with the use of the study medication whether or not 
considered related to the study medication. Adverse events will be captured once a subject has signed the informed consent. AEs include: 
• Changes in the general condition of the subject 
• Subjective symptoms offered by or elicited from the subject 
• Objective signs observed by the Investigator or other study personnel 
• All concurrent diseases that occur after the start of the study, including any change in 
severity or frequency of pre- existing disease  
• All clinically relevant laboratory  abnormalities or physical findings that occur during 
the study 
A treatment -emergent adverse event  (TEAE) is any condition that was not present prior to 
treatment with study medication but appeared following treatment, was present at treatment 
initiation b ut worsened during treatment, or was present at treatment initiation but resolved and 
then reappeared while the individual was on treatment (regardless of the intensity of the AE 
when the treatment was initiated).  
All AEs, including both observed or volunteered problems, complaints, signs or symptoms must 
be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF, regardless of whether associated with the use of study 
medication. This would include AEs resulting from concurrent illness, reactions to concurrent 
medication use, or progression of disease states (excluding the disease under study). A condition present at baseline that worsens after initiation of study treatment will be captured as an AE; the 
onset date will be the date the event worsened. The AE should be recorded in standard medical 
terminology when possible. 
14.1.2. Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an AE that:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening (there is an immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred; this does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more serious form may 
have caused death) 
• Results in or prolongs an inpatient hospitalization (Note: a hospitalization for elective or pre -planned surgery, procedure, or drug therapy does not constitute an SAE) 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 2 
16-Jan-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 80 
   • Results in permanent or substantial disability (permanent or substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to  conduct normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in offspring of a subject using the study medication regardless of time to diagnosis)  
• Is co nsidered an important medical event 
Important medical events are defined as events that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes. Exam ples of important medical events include malignancy, allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug ab use. 
14.2. Monitoring Adverse Events  
At each visit, subjects will be queried regarding any AEs that have occurred since the last visit. 
Subjects will be asked to volunteer information concerning AEs with a non-leading question 
such as, “How do you fee l?” Study site personnel will then record all pertinent information in the 
source documents and the eCRF. The study drug compliance record should also be reviewed to 
detect potential overdoses (intentional/unintentional). 
14.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
The deg ree of “relatedness” of the AE to the study medication must be descr ibed using the 
following scale:  
• Not related  indicates that the AE is definitely not related to the study medication.  
• Unlikely related  indicates that there are other, more likely causes and study 
medication is not suspected as a cause.  
• Possibly related indicates that a direct cause and effect relationship between study 
medication and the AE has not been demonstrated, but there is evidence to suggest 
there is a reasonable possibility that the event was caused by the study medication.  
• Probably related  indicates that there is evidence suggesting a direct cause and effect 
relationship between the AE and the study medication. 
It is the Sponsor’s policy to consider “Probably related” and “Possibly related” causality assessments as positive causality. “Not related” and “Unlikely related” causality assessments are 
considered as negative causality.  
Assessments will be recorded on the eCRF and must indicate clearly the relationship being 
assessed. For example, an AE that appears during a placebo run-in phase would be assessed with 
respect to the placebo treatment received and/or study procedures conducted during this phase. If 
the AE continued into a n active treatment phase, the relationship would be assessed for the active 
treatment phase only if the AE worsened.  

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 2 
16-Jan-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 81 
   14.4. Intensity Assessment  
The intensity (or severity) of AEs is characterized as mild, moderate, or severe:  
• Mild  AEs are usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and do not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate AEs introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and 
may interfere with daily activities, but are usually ameliorated by simple therapeutic measures.  
• Severe AEs interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and typically require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. 
When the intensity category of an AE changes, the greatest intensity during that continuous 
episo de should be recorded. 
14.5. Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
14.5.1. Reporting Adverse Events  
Throughout the study, AEs will be documented on the source document and on the appropriate page of the eCRF whether or not considered treatment- related. Thi s includes any new signs, 
symptoms, injury or illness, including increased severity of previously existing signs, symptoms, 
injury, or illness. Conditions existing prior to screening will be recorded as part of the subject’s 
medical history. The Investigator is responsible for assessing the relationship of AEs to the study medication; relationship will be classified as not related, unlikely related, possibl y related, or 
probably related.  
All AEs will be collected by the Investigator from the time of signing  the informed consent 
through 28 days after the last dose of study medication; this includes any AEs that are ongoing at 
the time of completion/termination of the study. All ongoing AEs must be followed until 
resolution or for 30 days after the subject’s l ast study visit, whichever comes first.  
14.5.2. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Any SAE, including death resulting from any cause, which occurs to any subject participating in 
this study must be reported via email or fax by the Investigator using the Endo Clinica l Trial 
Report Form for SAEs within 24 hours of first becoming aware of the SAE. SAEs will be 
collected by the Investigator from the time of signing the informed consent through 28 days after 
the last dose of study medication. SAEs that occur within 28 days, following cessation of the 
study treatment, or within 30 days, following premature discontinuation from the study for any reason, must also be reported within the same timeframe. Any SAE that is felt by the Investigator 
to be related to the study medica tion must be reported regardless of the amount of time since the 
last dose received. Follow-up information collected for any initial report of an SAE must also be 
reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of receipt by the Investigator. 
All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization of condition, or until follow-up is no 
longer possible. 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 2 
16-Jan-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 82 
   In the event discussion is necessary regarding treatment of a subject, call the Medical 
Monitor (see contact information in section  3). 
All SAEs should be sent via the email address, or faxed to the fax number, provided in section  3. 
The Sponsor will determine whether the SAE must be reported within 7 or 15 days to regulatory 
authorities in compliance with local and regional law. If so, the Sponsor (or the Sponsor’s 
representative) will report the event to the appropriate regulatory authorities. The Investigator 
will report SAEs to the IRB per their IRB policy.  
14.5.2.1. Follow-u p Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
To fully understand the nature of any SAE, obtaining follow-up i nformation is important. 
Whenever possible, relevant medical records such as discharge summaries, medical consultations, and the like should be obtained. In the event of death, regardless of cause, all 
attempts should be made to obtain the death certificate and any autopsy report. These records 
should be reviewed in detail, and the Investigator should comment on any event, lab abnormality, or any other finding, noting whether it should be considered a serious or 
non-serious AE, or whether it should be considered as part of the subject’s history. In addition, 
all events or other findings determined to be SAEs should be identified on the follow-up SAE form and the Investigator should consider whether the event is related or not related to study 
drug. 
14.6. Special R eporting Situations  
14.6.1. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events such as bruising, ecchymosis, hematomas, and contusions that occur remote to 
the site of drug administration, or any  hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, will be 
recorded and evaluated for seriousness and severity ( see s ection  14.1.1, Adverse Events or 
section  14.1.2, Serious Adverse Events). 
In addition, local AE s associated with the injection site, including bruising, pain, nodules/mass, 
ulceration, erythema, pruritus, swelling, and/or induration, will be recorded and evaluated for seriousness and severity (see as appropriate , section  14.1.1, Adverse Events or section  14.1.2, 
Serious Adverse Events) 
14.6.2. Overdose/Misuse/Abuse 
14.6.2.1. Overdose  
Study drug overdose is any accidental or intentional use of study drug in an amount higher than 
the dose indicated by the protocol for that subject. Study drug compliance (see section 12.9) should be reviewed to detect potential instances of overdose (intentional or accidental).  
Any study drug overdose during the study should be noted on the study medication eCRF. 
An overdose is not an AE per se, however all AEs associated with an overdose should both be 
entered on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported using the proc edures detailed in section  14.5.2, 
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events, even if the events do not meet seriousness criteria. If the 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 2 
16-Jan-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 83 
   AE associated wit h an overdose does not meet seriousness criteria, it must still be reported using 
the Endo Clinical Trial Report Form for SAEs and in an expedited manner, but should be noted 
as non-serious on the form and the Adverse Event eCRF. 
14.6.3. Pregnancy  
Subjects should be instructed to immediately notify the Investigator of any pregnancies.  
Any pregnancy that occurs in a subject during this clinical study will be reported for tracking 
purposes only . All subject pregnancies that are identified during or after this study, where the 
estimated date of conception is determined to have occurred during study drug therapy or within 
28 days of the last dose of study medication need to be reported, followed to conclusion, and the 
outcome reported, even if the subject is discontinued from the study. The Investigator  should 
report all pregnancies within 24 hours using the Initial Pregnancy Report Form, and any 
pregnancy-associated SAE using the SAE report form, according to the usual timelines and 
directions for SAE reporting provided in section 14.5.2. Monitoring of the pregnancy should 
continue until conclusion of the pregnancy; 1 or more Follow-up Pregnancy Report Form(s) detailing progress, and a Two Month Follow-up Pregnancy Report Form detailing the outcome, 
should be submitted. 
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that the investigational 
product under study may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. 
Likewise, elective abortions without complications are not considered AEs. Any SAEs 
associated with pregnancy (eg, congenital abnormalities/birth defects/spontaneous miscarriages or any other serious events) must additionally be reported as such using the SAE report form. 
Spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported and handled as SAEs. 
A subject who becomes pregnant must be withdrawn from the study . Attempts to obtain the 
pregnancy follow -up and pregnancy outcome information detailed above are necessary even if a 
subject discontinues treatment because of pregnancy.  
14.6.4. AEs/SAEs Experienced by Non -subjects Exposed to Study Medication  
Non-subjects are persons who are not enrolled in the study but have been exposed to study 
medication, including instances of diversion of study medication. All such AEs/SAEs occurring 
in non-subjects from such exposure will be reported to the Endo PVRM Department (when the 
non-subject agrees) on the departmental form for serious adverse experiences regardless of 
whether the event is serious or not. Instructions for completing the form for events experienced 
by non-subjects will be provided. SAEs occurring in non-subjects exposed to study medication 
will be processed within the same SAE rep orting timelines as described in section  14.5.2, 
Reporting Serious Adverse Events. Additionally, the drug accountability source documentation 
at the site should reflect this occurrence.  
14.7. Clinical Laboratory Determinations  
Clinical laboratory tests will be conducted according to the Schedule of Events (section 5). 
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed by a designated central laboratory . Each site will be 
provided with instructions on specimen collection, preparation, packaging and transport. Refer to the central laboratory manual for further i nformation regarding sample collection, handling, and 
labeling. The results of the tests will be returned to the investigational sites.  

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 2 
16-Jan-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 84 
   Clinical laboratory test data will be reviewed by the Investigator, or designee, and additional 
clinical laboratory tests may be ordered at his/her discretion (eg, if the results of any clinical 
laboratory test falls outside the reference range or clinical symptoms necessitate additional 
testing to ensure safety). Any additional testing will be performed by the designated central 
laboratory. The Investigator or qualified designee must acknowledge the review of laboratory 
results.  
The Investigator will review all abnormal lab results for potentially clinically important. Any 
abnormal clinical laboratory test result meeting the Investigator ’s criteria for potentially 
clinically important (refer to central laboratory manual) will be recorded as an AE or SAE as 
appropriate (see section 14.1.1, Adverse Events, and section 14.1.2, Serious Adverse Events). 
Laboratory results will be sent electronically to Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. for data management.  
Clinical laboratory parameters that will be measured in this study are listed in Table 9.

negative pregnancy test at the Screening Vi sit and at Day 1 (Baseline), Day 22, and Day 43 to be 
randomized and/or receive treatment in the study. If necessary, additional urine pregnancy tests can be performed at any time during the study at the discretion of the Investigator. Urine 
pregnancy test kits will be supplied by the Sponsor. 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 2 
16-Jan-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 86 
   14.11.  Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination will be performed at the Screening Visit. All examinations will 
be performed by a physician or health professional listed on the Form FDA 1572 and licensed to 
perform physical examinations. Height and body weight will be meas ured and recorded at 
screening.  
The Investigator will review all physical exam findings for clinical significance. Any physical 
exam finding meeting the Investigator ’s or Sponsor’s criteria for clinical significance will be 
recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate (see section  14.1.1, Adverse Events and section  14.1.2, 
Serious Adverse Events ). 
At screening, the Investigator will also assess the subject’s skin type using the Fitzpatrick scale 
(Table 11). Only the Fitzpatrick Scale shown below may be used during the study. 
Table 11: Fitzpatrick Scale  
I Pale white skin, blue/hazel eyes, blond/red hair  Always burns, does not tan 
II Fair skin, blue eyes  Burns easily, tans poorly 
III Darker white skin  Tans after initial burn  
IV Light brown skin  Burns minimally, tans easily  
V Brown skin  Rarely burns, tans darkly easily  
VI Dark brown or black skin  Never burns, always tans darkly  
Follow-up body weight will be measured before injection on Day 22 and Day 43 and at the 
Day 71 visit.

   17.2. Subject Populations  
Four (4) populations are considered in the statistical analysis of the study: safety, intent- to-treat 
(ITT),  modified ITT  (mITT),  and per-protocol (PP). 
17.2.1. Safety Population 
The safety population is defined as all enrolled subjects who have received at least one injection 
of study medication. All safety parameters will be summarized based on this population. 
17.2.2. Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Popul ation 
The ITT population is defined as all randomized subjects who have received at least one 
injection of study medication. All demographic and baseline characteristic summaries will be 
based on this population. The primary and key secondary efficacy para meters will be 
summa rized based on this population. 
17.2.3. Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population 
The mITT population is defined as all intent- to-treat subjects with a baseline and at least 1 
post-injection evaluation of both the Investigator CR-PCSS and subject PR- PCSS for both the 
target and non- target buttocks. All secondary and supportive efficacy evaluations will be based 
on the mITT population. 
17.2.4. Per-Protocol (PP) Population 
The per -protocol population is defined as the mITT subjects without any of the following :  
• Placebo -assigned subject receives EN3835 treatment  
• EN3835-assigned subject receives placebo treatment only throughout study 
• Any subject receives protocol-prohibited medications 
• Subject lacking PR -PCSS and/or CR- PCSS assessment at  Day 71  
• Any major protocol deviation that is deemed as impact subject efficacy  
This population may be used in the efficacy sensitivity analysis.  
17.3. Subject Disposition  
The number of subjects included in each study population will be summarized by treatment 
group. Subjects excluded from the safety and efficacy (eg, ITT) populations will be listed by 
treatment group.  
The number and percentage of subjects completed and prematurely discontinued during the treatment period will be presented for each treatment group  and pooled across treatment groups. 
Screen failures (ie, screened but not randomized subjects) and the associated failure reasons will 
be tabulated overall. Reasons for premature discontinuation from the treatment period as 
recorded on the termination page of the eCRF will be summarized (number and percentage) by treatment group for all randomized subjects. Percentage of premature discontinuations will be 
compared between treatment groups.  

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 2 
16-Jan-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 91 
   17.4. Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
The summarization o f demographic variables (eg, age, sex, race, weight, height, and body mass 
index [ BMI]), medical and surgical history, and other baseline characteristics relevant to the 
indication studied in the study will be described. 
Demographic characteristics, including sex, age, age group, race, height, and weight, will be 
summarized by treatment group, for the ITT population, using descriptive statistics. All 
screening characteristics and medical information will also be summarized  by treatment group 
using descriptive statistics. The descriptive summaries will include frequency tables for all 
categorical response variables and n, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and 
maximum for all continuous variables.  
17.5. Efficacy Analy ses 
All efficacy endpoints including supportive efficacy analysis will be summarized as percentages. 
The dichotomous secondary endpoints (ie, responder endpoints) will be analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted for Investigator . Changes in t he PR -PCSS ratings and 
CR-PCSS ratings from baselines, S -GAIS scores, I -GAIS scores , and SSRS scores will be 
analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Changes in PR- CIS from baselines will be analyzed 
using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for baseline values. All the tests are two -
sided. 
The primary endpoint will be summarized as percentages and analyzed using a Cochran- Mantel -
Haenszel test that compares the 2 treatment groups and adjusts for Investigator at a level of 
significance of 0.05 based on the ITT population. Any subject who does not have an evaluation 
of CR -PCSS and/or PR- PCSS at Day 71 will be classified as a non -responder. 
The key secondary efficacy analyses will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary 
endpoint based on the ITT population. Any subject who does not have an evaluation at Day 71 
will be classified as a non -responder for the analyses. The family #1 key secondary efficacy 
analyses will be performed only if the primary efficacy analysis is significant ( p ≤ 0.05; 
gatekeeping strategy). Similarly family #2 key secondary efficacy analyses will be performed only if at least one of the key secondary efficacy endpoints of family #1 is significant ( p ≤ 
0.0125; parallel gatekeeping strategy)  and family #3 key secondary efficac y analyses will be 
performed only if at least one of the key secondary efficacy endpoints of family #2 is significant (parallel gatekeeping strategy) . Within a family of key secondary efficacy endpoints, the 
Bonferroni method will be performed to relocate unused alpha for testing each endpoint to assure 
an overall error rate of p ≤ 0.05. The details of the testing procedures will be provided in the 
statistical analysis plan for the study.  
All supportive endpoints will be summarized as subject counts and per centages  for categorical 
data or n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous data. All the supportive 
analyses will be performed based on all observed data (ie, missing data not imputed) in the mITT population at all visits without multiplicity adjustment. This analysis will also be performed at 
Day 71 with missing data at Day 71 imput ed by a last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
approach if subjects have at least one post-dose assessment. The dichotomous secondary 
endpoints (ie, responder endpoints) will be analyzed using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel test 
adjusted for Investigator . Changes in the PR -PCSS ratings and CR- PCSS ratings from baselines, 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 2 
16-Jan-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 92 
   S-GAIS scores, I -GAIS scores , and SSRS scores will be analyzed us ing the Wilcoxon rank sum 
test. Changes in PR- CIS from baselines will be analyzed using an  analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) adjus ted for baseline values.  
17.5.1. Primary Efficacy Variable 
The primary efficacy variable is the proportion of 2-level composite responders at Day 71 
defined as subjects with: 
• an improvement in severity from baseline (Day 1 visit) of at least 2 levels of severity 
in the CR- PCSS as assessed live by the Investigator of the target buttock, and  
• an improvement in severity from baseline of at least 2  levels of severity in the 
PR-PCSS by the subject while viewing the digital image of the target  buttock.

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 2 
16-Jan-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 97 
   17.6.1. Prior, Concomitant, and Follow- up Medication  
The World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary will be used to classify prior and 
concomitant medications by therapeutic class. Prior medication will be defined as any 
medication taken prior to the first dose of study drug. Concomitant medication is defined as any 
medication taken on or after the da te of first dose of study drug.  
Prior and concomitant medication use will be summarized descriptively by the number and 
percentage of subjects for each preferred term (generic name from WHO dictionary) by 
treatment. Multiple use of the same medication by a subject will be counted only once. 
17.6.2. Study Drug Exposure  
The following information regarding treatment will be summarized per each treated buttock by 
treatment group:  
• Total number of treatment visits  
• Number of subjects who had treatment session done or treatment session not done at each treatment visit  
• For subjects who had the treatment session done, the number of subjects who got all 24 injections at the treatment visit o r who received less than 24 injections 
• Number of injections given at each treatment visit  
• Number of dimples treated at each treatment visit  
• Average number of injections per dimple at each treatment visit  
Subjects who did not receive all 3 treatment visits and who did not receive 24 injections at a 
treatment visit will be listed.

Not applicable (the study drug is administered at the site by the study investigator).  
17.6.4. Adverse Events  
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be used to code AEs. 
An AE (classified by preferred term) that started on or after the date of the first dose of the study 
drug will be considered a TEAE if it was not present prior to the first dose of study drug, or was 
present prior to the first dose of study drug but increased in intensity during the treatment period. 
If more than 1 AE is reported prior to the first dose of study drug and coded to the same preferred term, then the AE with the greatest intensity will be used as the benchmark for 
comparison to the AEs occurring during the treatment period which were also coded to that preferred term. Any AE present prior to the first dose of study drug that increases in intensity during the treatment period will be re -entered with a new start date of the date of increased 
intensity.  
Descriptive statistics (the number and percentage) for subjects reporting TEAEs in each treatment group will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term; by system organ 
class, preferred term, an d severity; and by system organ class, preferred term, and relationship to 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 2 
16-Jan-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 98 
   study drug. If more than 1 AE is coded to the same preferred term for the same subject, the 
subject will be counted only once for that preferred term using the most severe and most related 
occurrence for the summarization by severity and by relationship to the study drug. 
The by -frequency summaries will also include incidence of the SAEs and non- SAEs by preferred 
term that at least 2% of the subjects in one treatment group. Duration of AEs will be tabulated by 
treatment group.  
The Fisher e xact test will be use d to compare EN3835 to placebo. 
Listings will be presented for subjects with SAEs, subjects with AEs leading to discontinuation of study or study drug, and subjects who die (if any).  
17.6.5. Vital Signs  
Descriptive statistics for vital signs (eg, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and 
body weight) and their changes from baseline at each visit and at the end of study will be 
presented by treatment group. 
Vital sign values are potentially clinically important (PCI) if they meet both the observed value 
criteria and the change from baseline criteria. The criteria for PCI vital sign values will be 
detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The PCI percentages will be calculated relative to 
the number of subjects with baseline and at least one post- baseline assessment. A supportive 
listing of subject values will be provided including the subject ID, study center, treatment group, 
baseline and post- baseline values.  
The chang e from baseline for vital signs parameters are compared between EN3835 and placebo 
using an analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with a factor of drug (EN3835 or placebo) while the 
Fisher exact test will be used for the incidence of PCI values.  
17.6.6. Clinical Laboratory Parameters  
Descriptive statistics for clinical laboratory values in International System of Units (SI units) and 
changes from baseline at Day 71 will be presented by treatment group for each clinical 
laboratory parameter.  
The number and percentage of subj ects with potentially clinically important (PCI) post- baseline 
clinical laboratory values will be tabulated by treatment group. The criteria for PCI laboratory values will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The PCI percentages will be 
calculated relative to the number of subjects with at least one post- baseline assessment. A 
supportive listing of subjects with post-baseline PCI values will be provided, including the 
subject ID, study center, treatment group, baseline and post- baseline values.  
The change from baseline for clinical laboratory parameters are compared between EN3835 and 
placebo using an ANOVA with a factor of drug (EN3835 or placebo) while the Fisher exact test 
will be used for the incidence of PCI values.  
17.6.7. Electrocardiogram

   18.5. Study Drug Accountability  
A drug inventory form must be kept current by the site staff designated to be responsible for 
reconstitution and must be made available to the clinical monitor, Endo employees, IRB/IEC, 
and regulatory agencies for routine inspection and accountability during monitoring visits. When 
instructed by Endo, the Investigator agrees to return all original used or unused study drug kits to Endo's return vendor. 
18.5.1. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
The Investigator agrees not to supply study drug to any person except to those subjects enrolled 
in the study. The Investigator is responsible for recording the receipt and use of all drugs supplied and for ensuring the supervision of the storage and allocation of these supplies. All used 
and unused study drug will be returned, and unit counts will be performed whenever medication 
is returned. The site must account for all study drug received and its use. At the end of the study, all used and unused drug supplies will be returned to Endo’s return vendor.

   22. DATA HANDLING AND RE CORDKEEPING  
22.1. Data Collection  
Endo will provide an electronic data capture (EDC) system for this study. Data c ollection will 
involve the use of an EDC system to which only authorized personnel will have access. The 
system will be secured to prevent unauthorized access to the data or the system. This will include 
the requirement for a user ID and password to enter or change data. The level of access to the 
EDC system will be dependent on the person’s role in the study. 
Study data will be collected from source documents and entered into an eCRF within the EDC 
system. The Investigator will be responsible for ensuring the eCRFs are completed in a timely 
manner relative to the subject’s visit. In addition to periodic monitoring occurring within the system by a Sponsor monitor, programmatic edit checks will be used to review EDC data for 
completeness, logic, and adherence to the study protocol. As a result of this monitoring and these 
checks, queries may be issued electronically to the clinical study sites and closed electronically by the monitor, data management staff or authorized staff at the study site. Additionally, t he 
Investigator will review eCRFs, ensure all missing or corrected data is provided and will sign the eCRF page s with an electronic signature.  
An electronic audit trail will be maintained in the EDC system to track all changes made to data 
entered in the eCRF. Data will be retrievable in such a fashion that all information regarding 
each individual subject is attributable to that subject. Unless otherwise indicated, all data captured in the eCRF must first be captured in source documents. Data that can be directly 
recorded in the eCRF will be clearly identified in the section(s) of the protocol that describes the 
assessment(s).  
Data entries will be corrected by changing the entry in the EDC system. Any changes or 
corrections to eCRF data will be electronically tracked and will include the reason for correction, 
who made the correction and the date/time stamp when the correction was made within the audit trail of the EDC system.  
In addition, any contact with the subject via telephone or other means that provide significant clinical information must be documented in source documents as described above. 
22.2. Study Documentation  
Upon study completion, the Investigator will be provided with complete electronic copies of the 
case report form (CRF)  data for hi s/her files .

Scale (PR -CIS)  
At the Day 1 visit and Day 71 visit, subjects will be instructed to answer 6 questions related to the areas selected for treatment on their 
buttocks on the Patient Reported Cellulite 
Impact Scale (Appendix D)  while viewing 
digital images of their buttocks . The PR -CIS 
assesses the visual and emotional impact of cellulite (happy, bothered, self -consci ous, 
embarrassed, looking older or looking  
overweight or out of shape) using a 6 -question 
survey, with each question rated on a numerical rating scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely).  
This variable will be entered directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic database will 
serve as the direct point of data capture and 
will serve as source for this variable.

13.1. 2.6 Hexsel 
Cellulite Severity 
Scale 13.1.2.6.  Hexsel Cellulite Severity Scale  
The Hexsel Cellulite Severity Scale (referred to as the Hexsel CSS) is a photonumeric  scale 
that looks at 5 key morphologic features of cellulite: (A) number of evident depressions, 
(B) depth of depressions, (C) morphological 
appearance of skin surface alterations, (D) laxity, flaccidity or sagging of skin, and (E) current classification scale based on medical literature including Nürnberger and Müller.(12,13) Each of these features is 
evaluated on a 4 -point scale from a low of 0 to 
a high of 3 as described in Table 8. The total 
score is the summation of all 5 features (Appendix D).  
The Investigator or qualified designee will independently use the Hexsel CSS to assess 
the severity of EFP in each of the two buttocks 
at the Screening visit and each of the two buttocks on Day 1 (Note: In this study, the Hexsel CSS is used exclusively for assess ment 
of subject eligibility; it is not used as an 
efficacy assessment). All cellulite assessments 
should be made while the subject is in the standing position with relaxed gluteus muscles. However, when evaluating the subject for Category E (classification  scale by 
Nürnberger and Müller) (13) if the subject has 
no evident depressions, the subject should be 
asked to contract her gluteus muscles or the pinch test should be applied (by pinching the skin between the thumb and index finger) so the Investigator o r qualified designee can 
differentiate between scores/grades of zero (0) 
or I. 
This variable will be entered directly into the 
EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.

Name of Investigational Product : EN3835 
Name of Active Ingredient : Collagenase clostridium histolyticum  
Title of Study : A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo- Controlled Study of EN3835 in the 
Treatment of Edematous Fibrosclerotic Panniculopathy 
Lead Principal Investigator:  
Study Period :  
Estimated date first subject enrolled:  J an-2018 
Estimated date last subject completed:  S ep-2018 Phase of Development : 3 
Objectives :  
To assess the efficacy and safety of EN3835 in the treatment of edematous fibrosclerotic panniculopathy 
(EFP), commonly known as cellulite, in adult women  
Study Design: This study is a Phase 3 randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled study of the 
efficacy and safety of EN3835 in the treatment of EFP in adult women. Subjects will be screened for 
study eligibility within 14 days prior to enrolling in this study. Subjects with 2  treatment areas (bilateral 
buttocks) (also referred to as quadrants) with moderate or severe levels of cellulite as independently assessed by the subject using the Patient Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (PR -PCSS) 
and by the I nvestigator using the Clinician Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR -PCSS) 
will be eligible. The eligibility of the butto cks will be confirmed on Day 1. 
Once the eligibility of the  buttocks is confirmed, subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment 
group (EN3835 0.84 mg per buttock or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio within an investigational site. Each subject will receive a treatment course which consists of up to 3 treatment visits ( sessions), separated by 
21 days (ie, Days 1, 22, and 43). Each treatment visit will consist of 12 injections (0.3 mL per injection of EN3835 0.07 mg/injection or placebo; 0.84 mg in 3.6 mL per buttock) in each of the two buttocks for 
a total volume of 7.2 mL (1.68 mg). Selection of dimples to be treated in the buttocks will be at the discretion of the Investigator. End of study will occur at study day 71.  
At each treatment visit, each of the buttocks will be photographed before and after marking dimples and 
injection sites while the subject is in a consistent , standardized  relaxed standing pose. The subject will 
assess the digital photographic image (pre-marking) of each of the buttocks using the PR- PCSS to 
determine the severity of EFP in each of the buttocks. In addition, the subject will evaluate each of the buttocks using a Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (S -GAIS). Subsequently, the Investigator  
will conduct live assessments of each buttock using the CR -PCSS. At Day 1, the subject will complet e a 
Patient Reported Cellulite Impact Scale ( PR-CIS) assessment. The subject assessments will always be 
completed prior to and independently of the Investigator assessments at each treatment visit. In addition, the Investigator  will assess each of the buttocks using an Investigator Global Aesthetic Improvement 
Scale (I -GAIS). All of the assessments must be done before the dimple marking.  
At Day 71 (End of Study/Early Termination), photographs of each of the buttocks will be taken and evaluated by subject us ing the PR- PCSS. The Investigator  will conduct live assessments of each of the 
buttocks using the CR-PCSS. Global assessment evaluations will be completed by both the subject and the Investigator .

Analyses:  
Analyses of Primary Endpoint: 
The primary endpoint is the proportion of 2- level composite responders at Day 71 defined as subjects 
with at least one of two treated buttocks with:  
• an improvement in severity from baseline (Day 1 visit) of at least 2 levels of severity in the 
CR-PCSS as assessed live by the Investigator, and 
• an improvement in severity from baseline of at least 2  levels of severity in the PR -PCSS as 
assessed by the subject while viewing the digital image of the same buttock.  
A subject will be considered a responder if these criteria are met in the left buttock or right buttock or 
both buttocks in that subject. 
The primary endpoint will be summarized as percentages and analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel  test that compares the 2 treatment groups and adjusts for Investigator at a level of significance 
of 0.05. The ITT population will be evaluated for the primary endpoint with any subject not having an 
evaluation of CR- PCSS and/or PR- PCSS at Day 71 classified as a non -responder. 
Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint will include:  
• ITT subjects with missing data handled by multiple imputation (MI) approach 
• ITT subjects with missing data handled by a last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
approach  
• mITT  subjects with missing data handled by an LOCF approach  
• Observed data only (no missing data imputed) 
• Per-protocol (PP) subjects with missing data handled by an LOCF approach if 10% or more 
subjects are excluded in the PP population from mITT population. 
Analyses of Key Secondary Endpoints :  
There will be 4 key secondary endpoints grouped as two families of 2 endpoints per family analyzed in a hierarchical order.  
• Family #1 – two endpoints: 
- Proportion of 1- level PR -PCSS responders defined as subjects with ≥1- level 
improvement in PR-PCSS severity rating of left buttock at Day 71 compared to Day 1 
- Proportion of 1- level PR -PCSS responders defined as subjects with ≥1- level 
improvement in PR-PCSS severity rating of right buttock at Day 71 compared to Day 1 
• Family # 2 – two endpoints: 
- Proportion of 1- level S -GAIS responders defined as subjects with ≥1- level 
improvement (improved, much improved or very much improved) in the S- GAIS 
assessment of left buttock at Day 71  
- Proportion of 1- level S -GAIS responders defined as s ubjects with ≥1 -level 
improvement (improved, much improved or very much improved) in the S- GAIS 
assessment of right buttock at Day 71

The key secondary efficacy analyses will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary endpoint based 
on the ITT population. The family #1 key secondary efficacy analyses will be performed only if the primary efficacy analysis is significant at a significance level of p ≤ 0.05 (gatekeeping strategy). 
Similarly, family #2 key secondary efficacy analyses will be performed only if at least one of the key secondary efficacy endpoints of family #1 is significant at a significance level of p  ≤ 0.025 (parallel 
gatekeeping strategy). Within a family of key secondary efficacy endpoints, Bonferroni ’s method will be 
performed to relocate unused alpha for testing each endpoint to assure an overall error rate of p ≤ 0.05. 
The details of the testing procedures will be provided in the statistical analysis plan for the study.

• Proportion of satisfied responders (defined as subjects with a response of at least 1  
(ie, 1-Satisfied or 2 -Very Satisfied) in the subject satisfaction with cellulite treatment 
assessment (Day 71)  
All supportive endpoints will be summarized as percentages. The dichotomous secondary endpoints 
(ie, responder endpoints) will be analyzed using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted for 
Investigator. Changes in th e PR -PCSS ratings and CR -PCSS ratings from baselines, S -GAIS scores, and 
I-GAIS scores will be analyzed using the Mann -Whitney test.  
Safety Analysis : 
The following variables are safety endpoints:  
• AEs: Mapped to preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA)  
• Vital signs  
• Clinical laboratory tests  
AEs will be summarized by proportion of subjects reporting each event. Fisher’s Exact test will be used 
to compare EN3835 to placebo. Descriptive statistics will be presented for actual and change from 
baseline at each visit for vital signs and for each clinical laboratory test parameter. The comparison 
between treatment groups will be based on the change from baseline for clinical laboratory tests and vital signs using an analysis of v ariance (ANOVA)  with a factor of drug (EN3835 or placebo). 
Immunogenicity : Anti -AUX -I and anti- AUX -II antibody levels will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics for the actual value at the visit. Samples from Day 1, Day 22, Day 43, and Day 71 visits will be 
analyzed for anti -AUX -I and anti- AUX -II antibodies and a subset of Day 1 and Day 71 samples will be 
analyzed for neutralizing antibodies.

   8. INTRODUCTION 
8.1. Background  
8.1.1. Edematous Fibrosclerotic Panniculopathy  
Edematous fibrosclerotic panniculopathy (EFP), commonly known as cellulite, has been defined 
as a local metabolic disorder of subcutaneous tissues that results in a contour abnorm ality of the 
skin.(1)  The condition manifests as dimpled skin, particularly in the gluteal -femoral region. (2,3) 
EFP is caused by herniation of subcutaneous fat lobules through the dermohypodermal junction and/or shortening of the collagen septa that cross the hypodermal layer and connects the dermis to the underlying fascia. This creates an uneven surface with dimpling.( 1,2) EFP is a medical 
condition resulting in a potentially cosmetically unacceptable alteration of the skin, and affects an estimated 85% to 98% of postpubertal women.( 1,3) 
The pathophysiology of EFP is not completely understood, but there are 3 main theories: edema 
resulting from excessive hydrophilia of the intercellular matrix, alteration of the regional 
microcirculation, and different anatomical conformation of collagenous subcutaneous tissues in women versus men.(4)  
It is known that EFP is different from generalized obesity. In generalized obesity, adipocytes undergo hypertrophy and hyperplasia that are not limited to the pelvis, thighs, and abdomen.(1 ) 
In areas of EFP, adipocytes have physiologic and biochemical properties that differ from adipose 
tissue located elsewhere. Large, metabolically -stable adipocytes characterize EFP -prone areas; 
thus, the responsiveness to catecholamine-induced lipolysis is less in EFP tissues compared to 
visceral fat, which has the greatest responsiveness. (1) 
Subcutaneous fat lobes are separated from one another by thin, usually rigid strands of collagenous connective tissues, which cross the fatty layers and connect the dermis to the underlying fascia. These septa stabilize the subcutis and divide the fat. In EFP, shortening of the 
collagen septa due to fibrosis provokes retraction at the insertion points of the trabeculae, 
causing the depressions that characterize EFP. (2) There are a higher percentage of thinner, 
perpendicular hypodermal septa in women with EFP than in men.(1)  Weight gain makes EFP 
more noticeable, but it may be present even in thin subjects. Genetics may also play a role sinc e 
EFP tends to run in families.  
8.1.2. Current EFP Treatments  
There are therapies that have been utilized in an attempt to treat cellulite; however, there are no 
approved pharmacologic treatments. Despite multiple therapeutic modalities, there is little 
scientific evidence that any of  these treatments are beneficial. In fact, much of the evidence is 
anecdotal, subjective, or based only on patient self- assessment. (5) Some of the hi storical 
treatments for EFP have included weight loss,(6)  topical agents ,(5) massage, (7) liposuction,( 5,6) 
mesotherapy ,(6) radiofrequency,(6)  subcision and powered subcision,(8)  and laser 
therapies ;(9,10) some of these treatments may pose an increased risk for adverse effects. (5)

   There remains an unmet medical need for safe and effective therapies to improve the aesthetic 
outcome in women with cellulite. To effectively treat cellulite, a therapeutic approach may 
require disruption of the dermal septa, which are composed of collagen and cause the skin 
dimpling th at is bothersome to many women. 
8.1.3. EN3835 (Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum) 
Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Endo) is developing EN3835 for the treatment of EFP. Because EN3835 is a proteinase that can hydrolyze the triple-helical region of collagen under 
physiological conditions, EN3835 has the potential to be effective in lysing subdermal collagen, such as those observed in the dermal septa, which are the underlying cause of the skin dimpling 
in women with EFP. EN3835 targets the collagenase structural matrix (eg, dermal septa) at the 
site of injection and does not require systemi c exposure to be effective.  
EN3835 is a parenteral lyophilized product comprised of 2 collagenases in an approximate 1:1 
mass ratio, Collagenase I (AUX -I, Clostridial class I collagenase) and Collagenase II (AUX -II; 
Clostridial class II collagenase). These collagenases are isolated and purified from the 
fermentat ion of Clostridium histolyticum . 
Collagenase AUX -I is a single polypeptide chain containing approximately 1,000 amino acids of 
known sequence and with a molecular weight of 114 kDa. Collagenase AUX- II is also 
approximately 1,000 amino acids long and has a molecular weight of 113 kDa. These 
2 collagenases are not immunologically cross -reactive and have different specificities, such that 
together they become synergistic, providing a very broad hydrolyzing reactivity toward collagen. 
Clostridial collagenases a re proteinases that can hydrolyze the triple-helical region of collagen 
under physiological conditions. 
EN3835 is currently approved (brand name is XIAFLEX
®) for: 1) the treatment of adults with 
Dupuytren’s contracture with a palpable cord and, 2) for the treatment of adult men with 
Peyronie’s disease with a palpable plaque and curvature deformity of at least 30° at the start of 
therapy.  
A recent Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (EN3835-201) of 
375 women randomized to treatment of one treatment area (quadrant) (quadrant was defined in 
study EN3835-201 as a left buttock, a right buttock, a left posterolateal thigh or a right posterolateral thigh) of cellulite with EN3835 0.84 mg or placebo in a 1:1 ratio assessed the 
effectiveness and safety of EN3835. Efficacy in this study was evaluated based on cellulite 
assessments using Clinician Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR -PCSS), Patient 
Reported Photonumeric Cellul ite Severity Scale (PR -PCSS), Investigator Global Aesthetic 
Improvement Scale (GAIS -I), Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS -S), and 
Subject Satisfaction with Cellulite Treatment.  
Results from the Phase 2b study demonstrated that treatment (3 visits approximately 21 days 
apart) improved the cellulite severity of the treatment area as assessed by the primary endpoint of 
2-level composite responder analyses, the proportion of responders based on an improvement of ≥2 levels in the appearance of cel lulite in both the patient PR -PCSS and the clinician CR -PCSS 
of buttocks and thighs was statistically significantly greater in subjects who received EN3835 0.84 mg (10.6%; p <0.001) compared to subjects who received placebo (1.6%); 1- level (or 
greater) resp onders in the PR-PCSS of EN3835-treated subjects (72.3%) was significantly 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 1 
16-Nov-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 33 
   greater than 1 -level responders in the placebo group (51.6%) ( p<0.001); statistically significant 
(p≤0.001) improvement in the appearance of cellulite based on the subject S -GAIS we re 
observed in EN3835 0.84- mg group (73.1%) compared to the placebo group (44.0%); and 62.9% 
of subjects in the EN3835 0.84 mg group were satisfied or very satisfied with the results of their 
cellulite treatment compared with only 35.9% of subjects in the placebo group ( p<0.001). In 
subjects treated in buttocks (n=187), the proportion of 2-level composite responders was statistically significantly greater in subjects who received EN3835 0.84 mg (14.9%; p<0.001) compared to subjects who received placebo (1.1%); 1 -level (or greater) responders in the 
PR-PCSS of EN3835-treated subjects (72.7%) was significantly greater than 1- level responders 
in the placebo group (47.8%) ( p<0.001). 
The study also demonstrated EN3835 to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events (SAEs) 
related to EN3835. Safety results from a total of 4 studies (1 pilot, 2 Phase 1, and 2 Phase 2 studies) in which 435 adult females received subcutaneous injections of EN3835 indicate that the majority of treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) are transient, non-serious, mild or 
moderate in intensity, and related to the local administration of EN3835. The immunogenicity profile after 3 treatment visits of EN3835 indicate that greater than 90% of EN3835- treated 
subjects were seropositive for AUX-I and/or AUX-II antibodies; this profile of EN3835 is 
similar to that observed in the Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease programs. 
A Phase 1, open-label safety and pharmacokinetic study of a single dose of EN3835 0.84 mg in 
11 female subjects with EFP showed that there was no quantifiable levels of AUX- I or AUX -II 
at any time  point after subcutaneous injection of EN3835 0.84 mg into one quadrant. A second 
Phase 1, open-label safety and pharmacokinetic study of a single dose of EN3835 0.84 mg  per 
treatment area in two treatment areas (buttock -buttock, thigh-thigh, or buttock- thigh) 
concurrently (total dose of 1.68 mg) showed that there was no quantifiable levels of AUX- I or 
AUX- II at any time  point post-dose attributable  to the injection of EN 3835 1.68 mg.  
The results from these studies suggest that subcutaneous injections of EN3835 in the area of 
cellulite may be a well- tolerated and effective medical  treatment for adults with EFP.  
8.2. Summary of Nonclinical Studies  
Non-clinical studies necessary to support clinical studies have been performed and are 
summarized in the Investigator Brochure (IB).( 11) Non -clinical studies in the following area s 
were performed: toxicology, reprotoxicity, genotoxicity, and hypersensitivity. 
8.3. Summary of Known Risks and Benefits  
A summary of safety risks is provided in the IB.( 11) The following events have been commonly 
observed: local injection site reactions (injection site bruising, injection site swelling, injection 
site pain) for the various approved indications as well as those being investigated. In the phase 
2b study of EN3835 in women with EFP, the following treatment related adverse events ≥2% of 
189 EN3835-treated women were reported: injection site bruising (75.1%), injection site pain (59.3%), injection site nodule (14.3%), injection site pruritus (11.1%), injection sit e swelling 
(7.4%), injection site induration (5.8%), injection site mass (5.3%), injection site discolouration (3.2%), and injection site erythema (2.1%). These events are similar to events reported in the clinical trials of EN3835 for the approved indications. Postmarket ing safety data are consistent 
with safety data reported in clinical trials.  

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 1 
16-Nov-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 34 
   Although a thorough benefit of EN3835 has not been fully evaluated in the treatment of EFP, the 
efficacy results from the Phase 2b study and previous EFP studies w arranted further 
development. 
8.4. Rationale  
The results from the Phase 2b EFP study (EN3835-201) further suggested that EN3835 0.84 mg per treatment area (quadrant) is an effective treatment of EFP based on improvement in the 
severity of cellulite as determine d by the Investigator and the subject. There were no safety 
concerns following 0.84 mg per treatment area in the treatment of EFP ( section  8.1.3). S afety 
findings from the Phase 2b EFP study are similar to that observed in previous clinical studies with EN3835 in the treatment of EFP and XIAFLEX in the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture 
and Peyronie’s disease, in that that the majority of AEs occurred at the site of injection and resolved before the next scheduled treatment. The immunogenicity profile of EN3835 in the 
Phase 2b EFP study is similar in previous studies and programs. 
Based on the efficacy and safety findings from the Phase 2a and 2b EFP  studies, the EN3835 
0.84- mg dose per treatment area in two treatment areas (buttocks) warranted further investigation 
in this study.  
Treating two buttocks at each treatment visit will potentially provide a symmetrical-l ike 
improvement in appearance. Support for evaluation of the treatment of two buttocks concurrently 
is based on: 1) the safety findings from the previous EFP studies are local to the injection site, 
2) the pharmacological activity of EN3835 is local and does not require systemic exposure, and 3) no significant quantifiable systemic concentration has been attributable to injection of two 
buttocks concurrently. 
The integration of dose and use justification supports this study of evaluation of EN3835 
0.84 mg per treatment area in two treatment areas (buttocks) concurrently.

10.2. Selection of Doses  
The dose of EN3835 chosen for this study was based on the results from  earlier studies.  
The data from the Phase 2a EFP dose- ranging study (AUX -CC-831) suggest that EN3835 
0.84 mg is most effective in the treatment of EFP based on improvement in the severity of 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 1 
16-Nov-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 37 
   cellulite as determined by both the Investigator and the subject,  although the EN3835 0.48- mg 
group did show improvement in s ome of the efficacy parameters.  
• There were no safety concerns following administration of up to 3 treatment visits of 
EN3835 0.84 mg in the treatment of EFP (AUX- CC-831 CSR). The safety profile of  
EN3835 0.84 mg in the treatment of EFP was similar to that observed in the EN3835 0.06-mg group and the EN3835 0.48-mg group. No notable differences were observed across the 3 treatment groups. 
• Safety findings from the Phase 2a EFP dose- ranging study are similar to that 
observed in previous clinical studies with XIAFLEX in the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease, in that the majority of AEs occurred at the site of injection and resolved before the next scheduled treatment. 
• The immun ogenicity profile of EN3835 in the Phase 2a EFP dose- ranging study is 
similar to that observed in the Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease 
programs. 
• Based on the efficacy and safety findings from the Phase 2a EFP dose- ranging study, 
the EN3835 0.84-mg dose was carried forward to the Phase 2b study. 
The results from the Phase 2b EFP study (EN3835-201) further suggested that EN3835 0.84 mg is an effective treatment of EFP based on improvement in the severity of cellulite as determined 
by the Investi gator and the subject . There were no safety concerns following EN3835 0.84 mg 
in the treatment of EFP ( section  8.4). Safety findings from the Phase 2b EFP study are similar to 
that observed in previous clinical studies with XIAFLEX in the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease, in that that the majority of AEs occurred at the site of injection and resolved before the next schedule d treatment . The immunogenicity profile of 
EN3835 in the Phase 2b EFP study is similar to that observed in the Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease programs. 
Based on the efficacy and safety findings from the Phase 2a and 2b EFP studies, the EN3835 
0.84- mg dose per treatment area was carried forward to this study . The findings from previous 
studies that the majority of adverse events after EN3835 treatment are local to the injection site 
and that there is no quantifiable systemic exposure observed after concurrent treatment of two 
buttocks (total dose of 1.68 mg) supports the proposed study to evaluate EN3835 treatment of 
two buttocks. 
10.3. Study Drug Administration  
Study drug will be injected subcutaneously while the subject is in a prone position using a 
syringe with a 30 -gauge ½ -inch needle. Each injection site will receive a single skin injection of 
study drug administered as three 0.1-mL aliquots to Positions A, B, and C (for a total injection 
volume of 0.3 mL) as shown in the following figure. The depth of injection corresponds to the 
length of the treatment needle (0.5 inches) from the tip of the needle to the hub or base of the 
needle without downward pressure. 
During each treatment visit, 8 syringes (4 syringes per buttock) will be prepared for dosing. Each 
syringe will contain 0.9 mL of study drug (ie, 3 injections in each syringe). Twelve (12) skin 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 1 
16-Nov-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 39 
   10.4. Care Procedures After Injection  
To evaluate the su bject for possible immediate immunological AEs, the subject will remain in 
direct observation of medical personnel who are skilled in the management of an allergic 
reaction for 30 minutes after receiving the injections of study drug and until the subject e xhibits 
no sign of an immunological or other clinically significant systemic or local AE. The subject’s 
vital signs should be stable before the subject can leave direct observation (see s ection  14.9).  
The Investigator or qualified designee will then apply a sterile dressing to the injection areas with hypoallergenic tape. The subject will be instructed to remove the dressing in the evening. 
10.5. Discussion  of Study Design, Including the Choice of Control Groups  
The design of this study was based on the primary objective to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EN3835 0.84 mg per buttock in the concurrent treatment (total dose of 1.68 mg) of 2 bilateral 
buttocks with EFP in adult women compared with placebo treatment. The study design, a 
multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is in accordance with regulatory guidelines of adequate and well -controlled clinical studies ( Food and Drug Administration [ FDA ] Guidance 
for Industry: Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological 
Products, 1998.; ICH E8 and E10).

• Other reasons (reason must be specified, for example: the subject moved, pregnancy, 
Investigator decision, Sponsor decision to terminate trial, etc) 
If a subject discontinues from the study, all end-of-study procedures including safety and 
efficacy assessm ents should be conducted as detailed in the Schedule of Events (section  5). The 
date a subject discontinues and the reason for discontinuation will be recorded in the source 
documentation and electronic case report form  (eCRF). If, however, a subject withdraws consent, 
no end-of-study procedures and assessments are required (but are encouraged to reduce missing 
information) except the collection of adverse event (AE) information. This information should be 
recorded in the source documentation and the eCRF. 
11.3.1. Replacement Procedures  
Subjects who discontinue from the study will not be replaced.

   5. Prior to Investigator  CR- PCSS assessment, subjects will rate each of their two  buttocks 
using the PR- PCSS while viewing their digital images ( section  13.1.2.1); the Investigator 
is blinded to these ratings  
6. After the subject has completed the PR -PCSS rating s, the Investigator will conduct live 
assessments of subject’s cellulite severity of each of the two  buttocks using the CR- PCSS 
(section  13.1.2.5); the subject is blin ded to these ratings. The ratings from the PR- PCSS 
and CR- PCSS will be used to assess initial eligibility o f the buttocks for study entry 
7. Medical history including EFP history ( section  12.1.2.1)  
8. Record prior and concomitant medications/procedures (s ection  12.8)  
9. Physical examination including measurement of body weight, height, Fitzpatrick skin 
type ( section  14.11)  
10. Vital sign measurements ( section  14.9)  
11. 12-lead ECG ( section  14.10)  
12. Collection of samples for: 
a. Clinical laboratory testing ( section  14.7)  
b. Serum pregnancy testing (s ection  14.7)  
13. Adverse events ( section  14) 
12.2. Selecting and Marking Dimples during Treatment Visits  
Selection of dimples to be treated in the two buttocks is at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Dimples must be well-defined and evident when the subject is standing in a consistent, 
standardized  relax ed pose (without the use of any manipulation such as skin pinching or muscle 
contraction). Each subject will receive 3 treatment visits of study drug according to 
randomization unless the buttock is dimple- free (score of 0 on CR -PCSS as reported by the 
Investigator)  at Treatment Visit 2 and /or Treatment Visit 3 (a dimple - free buttock at Treatment 
Visit 1 is precluded by the eligibility criteria ); a dimple -free buttock at Treatment Visit 2 and /or 
Treatment Visit 3 does not preclude treatment of the contrala teral buttock unless it is dimple -free 
also. During each treatment visit, each of the buttocks will be photographed before and after marking dimples and injection sites while the subject is standing in a consistent, standardized relaxed pose as described in the Photography Manual. The cellulite severity assessments using 
the PR -PCSS  and CR- PCSS will be completed prior to marking dimples and injection sites.  
The Investigator or qualified designee will select dimples within each bu ttock that are well -
defined, evident when the subject is standing, and suitable for treatment; treatment consists of 12 injections per buttock (24 injections total in two buttocks) per treatment visit. Because the 
goal of treatment is to improve the aesthe tic appearance of each entire buttock, the Investigator 
will be instructed to select dimples that in his or her opinion would most improve the aesthetic 
appearance of each entire buttock. The same dimples within a buttock or different dimples within 
a butt ock may be treated at each treatment visit but injections must all be within the buttocks 
(12 injections per buttock) for all 3 visits. Each buttock will receive all 3  treatment visits unless 
the buttock has no treatable EFP dimples and the Investigator rates the buttock a score of 0 on the CR -PCSS. If no injections in a particular buttock (right or left) are given at Treatment 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 1

   Visit 2, subjects will still be assessed for treatment in the contralateral buttock at Treatment 
Visit 2, and will return for the Day 43 visit and each of the buttocks will again be evaluated by 
the subject (PR -PCSS) and Investigator (CR-PCSS). If the Investigator rates either or both of the 
buttocks greater than 0 on the CR- PCSS, injections at Treatment Visit 3 should be given.  
For e ach dimple selected for treatment, the Investigator or qualified designee will choose 
injection sites (injection sites within a dimple should be spaced approximately 2 cm apart, if a 
dimple requires more than 1 injection; locating at least one injection site at the nadir, if present, of the dimple). Each injection site will be marked with a “dot” using a surgical marker. For 
round dimples, the “dot” will be placed in the center of the dimple; for elongated dimples, “dots” 
will be spaced out approximately 2 cm along the longer axis of the dimple. The Investigator or qualified designee will then use a surgical marker to circle each of the dimples selected for 
treatment. Circles in the buttock should not overlap. 
Each of the buttocks will be photographed before and after marking dimples and injection sites 
while the subject is standing in a consistent , standardized  relaxed pose as described in the 
Photography Manual. Examples of subject dimple and injection site markings are shown as follows: 
Sample Buttock Mark ing 
 
12.3. Digital Photography during Treatment Visits 1, 2, and 3  
During each treatment visit, each of the two buttocks will be photographed before and after 
marking dimples and injections sites while the subject is standing in a consistent, standardized 
relaxed pose as described in s ection  13.1.1.

12.8. Prior and Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
All prior medications taken within 90 days before randomization will be recorded. All medications (including over-the-counter medications) taken by the subject on Day 1 through the end of the study must be recorded. Any prior treatments (medications or procedures) for EFP 
through the end of the study must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 1 
16-Nov-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 49 
   Additionally, any diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedures performed during the study 
period should be recorded including the date, indication for and description of the procedure. 
12.8.1. Prohibited Medications or Procedures  
The following medications are prohibited for randomized subjects during the study: 
anticoagulants (warfarin, heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors, Factor X inhibitors) and antiplatelet agents (aspirin >150 mg/day and P2Y12 inhibitors, such as clopidogrel), which can cause 
additional bruising. However the use of as pirin at a dose level of ≤150 mg per day will be 
permitted during study. 
Procedures listed in exclusion criterion #4 (section 11.2, Exclusion Criterion #4)  are prohibited 
for randomized subjects during the study. 
Table 4: Concomitant Medication Restrictions for Subjects d uring the Treatment 
Phase of Study  
Drug Class  Restrictions  
Anticoagulants  Subjects cannot take antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants (except for 
≤150 mg aspirin daily) within 7  days before and 7 days after the dosing 
administration.  
12.9. Treatment Compliance  
Randomized subjects will receive study drug administered by an Investigator at the 
Investigator ’s site.  
Accidental or intentional overdoses should be reported to the Sponsor/designee promptly (see 
section  14.6.2.1, Overdose). 
12.10.  Blinding and Randomization  
On Day 1, if each of the buttocks again meet the criteria (3 or 4 on the PR- PCSS and CR -PCSS) , 
the subject will be randomized to a treatment group. The interactive web response system  
(IWRS) will randomly assign each subject to a treatment group (EN3835 0.84 mg per buttock × 
two buttocks or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio within an investigational site. The treatment group will 
remain blinded to the Investigator, subjects, all site personnel, and the sponsor. The IWRS will assign the subject study drug kit numbers associated with the randomized treatment. At Day 22 
and 43 visits, the IWRS will again assign the subject study drug kit numbers associated with the 
randomized treatment assigned at Day 1 . 
All precautions will be taken to ensure that the blinding of EN3835 and placebo is maintained 
throughout the study period. Unblinding will not be permitted by the study site unless it is 
deemed necessary for treatment of a medical emergency. Before breaking the blind, the Investigator should make every attempt to contact the Medical Monitor to discuss the necessity 
of breaking the blind. The study site will have the ability to immediately determine treatment 
identification in the event of an emergency by using the unblinding function within the IWRS, however, the Medical Monitor must be notified immediately. The Investigator will be required to 
make a full written explanation of the reason for unblinding the subject and the date. In the event 
that a subject is unblinded prior to contacting the Medical Monitor, the Investigator must provide 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 1 
16-Nov-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 50 
   this information in writing to the Medical Monitor as soon as possible. Breaking the blind at the 
investigative site will immediately d isqualify the subject from further participation in the study. 
In addition, the event(s) leading to emergency unblinding must be reported as a n SAE  according 
to instructions in section 14.5.2, Reporting Serious Adverse Events . 
In addition, it may be necessary for the Investigator or qualified designee to unblind a subject as 
a result of a clinically significant finding noted during safety review by the Investigator, Safety 
Monitor, Medical Monitor and/or qualified designee that might jeopardize subject safety.

   13. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
13.1. Efficacy Measurements  
13.1.1. Digital Photography  
Although digital photographs are not direct efficacy measurements, digital photography will be 
utilized in the assessment of certain efficacy measurements ie to  assess certain cellulite severity 
parameters at specific intervals (see section  5, Schedule of Events) . At the Screening  visit, the 
Investigator or qualified designee will photograph each buttock using a Sponsor-supplied standard ized digital camera in a standardized manner. The subject will be standing for each 
photography session and will be wea ring a standardized photographic garment as described in 
the Photography Manual. The Investigator or qualified designee will photograph each of the two buttocks while the subject is standing in a consistent, standardized relaxed standing pose, ie, standing position with relaxed gluteus muscles, at the following time points:  
• Screening (no markings of dimples or injection s ite) - each of the two buttocks 
• Before and after marking dimples and injection sites (prior to injections) on Days 1, 22, and 43 - each of the two buttocks 
• During the Day 71 visit (end of study/early termination) (no dimple or injection site 
markings) - each of the two buttocks  
All photographs from this study are the property of Endo and may be utilized for clinical 
development, scientific communication, marketing, regulatory purposes, and/or legal 
applications as required/desired by Endo. 
13.1.2. Subject and Investigator Cellulite Assessments  
Investigator cellulite assessments are independent of the subject assessments. Therefore, all 
subject cellulite assessments must be completed before the Investigator’s cellulite assessments 
are initiated. The subject assessments will be done using a subject-assigned password protected 
electronic p atient  reported outcome ( ePRO ) system and the Investigator and study site personnel 
will not have access to the subject’s assessments or password; the clinician assessment will be 
recorded in an investi gator -assigned password protected system and the subject will not have 
access to the Investigator’s assessments or password. Subject assessments will be done alone 
with no study site personnel in the room. Investigators will be instructed not to verbalize their ratings while in the presence of the subject. 
13.1.2.1. Patient -Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (PR -PCSS)  
The PR -PCSS will be conducted for the purpose of assessing the severity of cellulite in the 
buttock. The scale is a 5 -level photonumeric scale developed specifically for patients and used 
by the subject to assess the severity of their cellulite in the buttocks by viewing digital images of 
each of their buttocks captured by photography at the visit; the ratings range from 0 (None) to 4 (Severe ) with labels and descriptors to aid the subject in the assessments.  

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 1 
16-Nov-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 52 
   At Screening and at the beginning of their visits on Day 1, Day 22, Day 43, and Day 71, subjects 
will have digital photographs taken of each of their two buttocks. Subjects will be given  
instructions in the proper use (Patient Instructions for Use of PR- PCSS)  of the PR- PCSS and 
then perform the PR-PCSS for each of the buttocks (Appendix B ). While viewing the digital 
images of each of their buttocks on a standardized computer monitor and using PR- PCSS for 
buttock, subjects will be instructed to answer the following question for each buttock: Today, how would you rate the severity of your cellulite in the area displayed using the PR-PCSS? The subject will be given the following explanations : Please try to match the severity of your 
cellulite, as seen in this digital image, with one of the cellulite levels on the PR -PCSS. Please 
look at the image of your cellulite and the pictures, labels, and descriptions on the PR-PCSS carefully before selecting your answer. If you feel that your cellulite level is between 2 of the 
levels, please select the level that is closest to your image. If you feel that your cellulite is exactly 
halfway between two PR- PCSS levels of cellulite severity, please select the more severe 
response. 
The subject will enter their rating electronically into an ePRO system; the Investigator and other 
site personnel will be blinded to the rating entered by the subject. This variable will be entered 
directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve as the direct point of data 
capture and will serve as source for this variable.  
13.1.2.2. Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (S -GAIS)  
Subjects will complete the S -GAIS for each of the buttocks as described below at the Day 22, 
Day 43, and Day 71 study visits using the pre- treatment Day 1 digital image (Baseline) of each 
of the buttocks for comparison. 
All treated su bjects will be instructed to answer the following question for each buttock:  
How would you rate the appearance of your treated cellulite after treatment? 
The S -GAIS assessment will occur after the subject has completed the PR -PCSS assessment to 
avoid introducing potential bias to the static PR- PCSS assessment. The subject will view each of 
their pre -treatment Day 1 digital images alongside their Day 22, Day 43 or Day 71/End of study 
visit digital images of each of their buttocks to aid in the assessment ( Table 5) . Subjects will 
provide a rating from those below that best represents their answer for each treated buttock. 
This variable will be entered directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve 
as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.

13.1.2.3. Patient Reported Cellulite Impact Scale ( PR-CIS)  
At the Day 1 visit and the Day 71 visit, s ubjects will be instructed to answer 6 questions related 
to the areas selected for treatment on their buttocks on the PR- CIS (Appendix D)  while viewing 
digital images of their buttocks . The PR- CIS assesses the visual and emotional impact of cellulite 
(happy, bothered, self-conscience, embarrassed, looking older, or looking overweight or out of 
shape) using a 6-question survey, with each question rated on a numerical rating scale from 
0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely).  
This variable will be entered directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve 
as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variabl e. 
13.1.2.4. Subject Satisfaction with Cellulite Treatment Assessment  
At the Day 71 visit, subjects will be instructed to answer a question related to their treated 
buttocks. Subjects will be given a list of responses and they will provide a rating from those 
below that best represents their answer  (Table 6) . 
Today, how satisfied are you with the results of the cellulite treatment you received on the 
specific area or areas on your buttocks that were treated? 
This variable will be entered directly into the EDC system,  thus the electronic database will serve 
as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.

   13.1.2.5. Clinician -Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR -PCSS)  
The CR -PCSS will be conducted for the purpose of assessing the severity of cellulite in the 
buttock. The scale is a 5 -level photonumeric scale developed specifically for clinicians and used 
by the Investigator to assess the severity of the subject’s cellulite in each buttock by live 
assessments; the ratings range from 0 (None) to 4 (Severe) with labels and descriptors to aid the 
Investigator in the assessments.  
Investigators will be trained and qualified on the use of the CR- PCSS p rior to assessing any 
subjects.  
At the Screening visit, the Investigator will determine severity of cellulite of each of the 
two buttocks via live assessment of the subject using the CR-PCSS for buttock (Appendix C ) 
after the subject has completed her self -assessment using the PR -PCSS. Before injections on 
treatment visits Day  1, Day 22, and Day 43, and on visit Day 71; Investigators will evaluate each 
of the two buttocks by live assessments using the CR-PCSS for the buttock to make his/her 
evaluation. At each visit, the Investigator will make his/her assessment independently and after the subject has conducted her self- assessment using the PR -PCSS.  
This variable will be entered directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable. 
13.1.2.6. Investigator Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (I -GAIS)  
On the Day 22, Day 43, and Day 71 study visits, the Investigator will determine the degree of 
improvement of each buttock by comparing the cellulite from the Day 1 pre -treatment (Baseline) 
digital image of each buttock to the cellulite seen in a live assessment (Table  7). The I- GAIS 
assessment will occur after the CR -PCSS assessment (section  13.1.2.5) to avoid introducing 
potent ial bias to the static CR -PCSS assessment by the Investigator. For each buttock, the 
Investigator will provide the rating from those below that best represents his/her answer. 
This variable will be entered directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve 
as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.

   14. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
14.1. Definitions 
14.1.1. Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable or unintended change in body structure (signs), body 
function (symptoms), laboratory result (eg, chemistry, ECG, X- ray, etc), or worsening of a 
pre-existing condition associated temporally with the use of the study medication whether or not 
considered related to the study medication. Adverse events will be captured once a subject has signed the informed consent. AEs include: 
• Changes in the general condition of the subject 
• Subjective symptoms offered by or elicited from the subject 
• Objective signs observed by the Investigator or other study personnel 
• All concurrent diseases that occur after the start of the study, including any change in 
severity or frequency of pre- existing disease  
• All clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities or physical findings that occur during the study 
A treatment -emergent adverse event  (TEAE) is any condition that was not present prior to 
treatment with study medication but appeared following treatment, was present at treatment 
initiation but worsened during treatment, or was present at treatment initiation but resolved and then reappeared while the individual was on treatment (regardless of the intensity of the AE 
when the treatment was initiated).  
All AEs, including both observed or volunteered problems, complaints, signs or symptoms must 
be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF, regardless of whether associated with the use of study 
medication. This would include AEs resulting from concurrent illness, reactions to concurrent 
medication use, or progression of disease states (excluding the disease under study). A condition present at baseline that worsens after initiation of study treatment will be captured as an AE; the 
onset date will be the date the event worsened. The AE should be recorded in standard medical 
terminology when possible. 
14.1.2. Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an AE that: 
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening (there is an immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred; this does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more serious form may 
have caused death) 
• Results in or prolongs an inpatient hospitalization (Note: a hospitalization for elective or pre -planned surgery, procedure, or drug therapy does not constitute an SAE) 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 1 
16-Nov-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 56 
   • Results in permanent or substantial disability (permanent or substantial disruption of 
one’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in offspring of a subject using the study medication regardless of time to diagnosis)  
• Is considered an important medical event 
Important medical events are defined as events that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes. Examples of important medical events include malignancy, allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
14.2. Monitoring Adverse Events  
At each visit, subjects will be queried regarding any AEs that have occurred since the last visit. 
Subjects will be asked to volunteer information concerning AEs with a non-leading question 
such as, “How do you feel?” Study site personnel will then record all pertinent information in the 
source documents and the eCRF. The study drug compliance record should also be reviewed to 
detect potential overdoses (intentional/unintentional). 
14.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
The degree of “relatedness” of the AE to the stud y medication must be described using the 
following scale:  
• Not related  indicates that the AE is definitely not related to the study medication.  
• Unlikely related  indicates that there are other, more likely causes and study 
medication is not suspected as a cause.  
• Possibly related indicates that a direct cause and effect relationship between study 
medication and the AE has not been demonstrated, but there is evidence to suggest 
there is a reasonable possibility that the event was caused by the study medication.  
• Probably related  indicates that there is evidence suggesting a direct cause and effect 
relationship between the AE and the study medication. 
It is the Sponsor’s policy to consider “Probably related” and “Possibly related” causality assessments as positive  causality. “Not related” and “Unlikely related” causality assessments are 
considered as negative causality.  
Assessments will be recorded on the eCRF and must indicate clearly the relationship being assessed. For example, an AE that appears during a placeb o run-in phase would be assessed with 
respect to the placebo treatment received and/or study procedures conducted during this phase. If the AE continued into an active treatment phase, the relationship would be assessed for the active treatment phase only if the AE worsened.

   14.4. Intensity Assessment  
The intensity (or severity) of AEs is characterized as mild, moderate, or severe:  
• Mild  AEs are usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and do not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate AEs introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and 
may interfere with daily activities, but are usually ameliorated by simple therapeutic 
measures.  
• Severe AEs interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and typically require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. 
When the intensity category of an AE changes, the greatest intensity during that continuous 
episode should be recorded. 
14.5. Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
14.5.1. Reporting Adverse Events  
Throughout the study, AEs will be documented on the source document and on the appropriate page of the eCRF whether or not considered treatment-related. This includes any new signs, symptoms, injury or illness, including increased severity of previously existing signs, symptoms, 
injury, or illness. Conditions existing prior to screening will be recorded as part of the subject’s 
medical history. The Investigator is responsible for assessing the relationship of AEs to the study medication; relationship will be classified as not related, unlikely related, possibl y related, or 
probably related.  
All AEs will be collected by the Investigator from the time of signing the informed consent through 28 days after the last dose of study medication; this includes any AEs that are ongoing at 
the time of completion/termination of the study. All ongoing AEs must be followed until 
resolution or for 30 days after the subject’s last study visit, whichever comes first. 
14.5.2. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Any SAE, including death resulting from any cause, which occurs to any subject participating in 
this study must be reported via email or fax by the Investigator using the Endo Clinical Trial 
Report Form for SAEs within 24 hours of first becoming aware of the SAE. SAEs will be collected by the Investigator from the time of signing the informed consent through 28 days after 
the last dose of study medication. SAEs that occur within 28 days, following cessation of the 
study treatment, or within 30 days, following premature discontinuation from the study for any reason, must also be reported within the same timeframe. Any SAE that is felt by the Investigator 
to be related to the study medication must be reported regardless of the amount of time since the 
last dose received. Follow-up information collected for any initial report of an SAE must also be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of receipt by the Investigator. 
All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization of condition, or until follow-up is no 
longer possible. 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 1 
16-Nov-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 58 
   In the event discussion is necessary regarding treatment of a subject, call the Medical 
Monitor (see contact information in section  3). 
All SAEs should be sent via the email address, or faxed to the fax number, provided in section  3. 
The Sponsor will determine whether the SAE must be reported within 7 or 15 days to regulatory 
authorities in compliance with local and regional law. If so, the Sponsor (or the Sponsor’s 
representative) will report the event to the appropriate regulatory authorities. The Investigator will report SAEs to the IRB per their IRB policy.  
14.5.2.1. Follow-u p Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
To fully understand the nature of any SAE, obtaining follow- up information is important. 
Whenever possible, releva nt medical records such as discharge summaries, medical 
consultations, and the like should be obtained. In the event of death, regardless of cause, all 
attempts should be made to obtain the death certificate and any autopsy report. These records 
should be reviewed in detail, and the Investigator should comment on any event, lab abnormality, or any other finding, noting whether it should be considered a serious or 
non-serious AE, or whether it should be considered as part of the subject’s history. In addition, 
all events or other findings determined to be SAEs should be identified on the follow-up SAE form and the Investigator should consider whether the event is related or not related to study 
drug. 
14.6. Special Reporting Situations  
14.6.1. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events such as bruising, ecchymosis, hematomas, and contusions that occur remote to 
the site of drug administration, or any  hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, will be 
recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate (see s ection  14.1.1, Adverse Events or s ection  14.1.2, 
Serious Adverse Events). 
14.6.2. Overdose/Misuse/Abuse 
14.6.2.1. Overdose  
Study drug overdose is any accidental or intentional use of study drug in an amount higher than 
the dose indicated by the protocol for that subject. Study drug compliance (see section  12.9) 
should be reviewed to detect potential instances of overdose (intentional or accidental). 
Any study drug overdose during the study should be noted on the study medication eCRF. 
An overdose is not an AE per se, however all AEs associated with an overdose should both be 
entered on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported using the procedures detailed in section  14.5.2, 
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events, even if the events do not meet seriousness criteria. If the 
AE associated with an overdose does not meet seriousness criteria, it must still be reported using 
the Endo Clinical Trial Report Form for SAEs and in an expedited manner, but should be noted as non-serious on the form and the Adverse Event eCRF. 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 1 
16-Nov-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 59 
   14.6.3. Pregnancy  
Subjects should be instructed to i mmediately notify the Investigator of any pregnancies.  
Any pregnancy that occurs in a subject during this clinical study will be reported for tracking 
purposes only . All subject pregnancies that are identified during or after this study, where the 
estimate d date of conception is determined to have occurred during study drug therapy or within 
28 days of the last dose of study medication need to be reported, followed to conclusion, and the outcome reported, even if the subject is discontinued from the study. The Investigator  should 
report all pregnancies within 24 hours using the Initial Pregnancy Report Form, and any 
pregnancy-associated SAE using the SAE report form, according to the usual timelines and 
directions for SAE reporting provided in section 14.5.2. Monitoring of the pregnancy should 
continue until conclusion of the pregnancy; 1 or more Follow-up Pregnancy Report Form(s) detailing progress, and a Two Month Follow-up Pregnancy Report Form detailing the outcome, 
should be submitted. 
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that the investigational 
product under study may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. 
Likewise, elective abortions without complications are not considered AEs. Any SAEs 
associated with pregnancy (eg, congenital abnormalities/birth defects/spontaneous miscarriages or any other serious events) must additionally be reported as such using the SAE report form. 
Spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported and handled as SAEs. 
A subject who becomes pregnant must be withdrawn from the study . Attempts to obtain the 
pregnancy follow -up and pregnancy outcome information detailed above are necessary even if a 
subject discontinues treatment because of pregnancy.  
14.6.4. AEs/SAEs Experienced by Non -subjects Exposed to Study Medication  
Non-subjects are persons who are not enrolled in the study but have been exposed to study 
medication, including instances of diversion of study medication. All such AEs/SAEs occurring 
in non-subjects from such exposure will be reported to the Endo PVRM Department (when the 
non-subject agrees) on the departmental form for serious adverse experiences regardless of 
whether the event is serious or not. Instructions for completing the form for events experienced 
by non-subjects will be provided. SAEs occurring in non-subjects exposed to study medication 
will be processed within the same SAE reporting  timelines as described in section  14.5.2, 
Reporting Serious Adverse Events. Additionally, the drug accountability source documentation 
at the site s hould reflect this occurrence.  
14.7. Clinical Laboratory Determinations  
Clinical laboratory tests will be conducted according to the Schedule of Events (section 5). 
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed by a designated central laboratory . Each site will be 
provided with instructions on specimen collection, preparation, packaging and transport. Refer to the central laboratory manual for further information regarding sample collection, handling, and labeling. The results of the tests will be returned to the investigational sites.  

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 1 
16-Nov-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 60 
   Clinical laboratory test data will be reviewed by the Investigator, or designee, and additional 
clinical laboratory tests may  be ordered at his/her discretion (eg, if the results of any clinical 
laboratory test falls outside the reference range or clinical symptoms necessitate additional 
testing to ensure safety). Any additional testing will be performed by the designated centra l 
laboratory. The Investigator or qualified designee must acknowledge the review of laboratory 
results.  
The Investigator will review all abnormal lab results for potentially clinically important. Any 
abnormal clinical laboratory test result meeting the Investigator ’s criteria for potentially 
clinically important (refer to central laboratory manual) will be recorded as an AE or SAE as 
appropriate (see section  14.1.1, Adverse Events, and section 14.1.2, Serious Adverse Events). 
Laboratory results will be sent electronically to Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. for data management.

negative pregnancy test at the Screening Visit and at Day 1 (Baseline), Day 22, and Day 43 to be randomized and/or receive treatment in  the study. If necessary, additional urine pregnancy tests 
can be performed at any time during the study at the discretion of the Investigator. Urine 
pregnancy test kits will be supplied by the Sponsor.

   14.11.  Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination will be performed at the Screening Visit. All examinations will 
be performed by a physician or health professional listed on the Form FDA 1572 and licensed to 
perform physical examinations. Height and body weight will be meas ured and r ecorded at 
screening.  
The Investigator will review all physical exam findings for clinical significance. Any physical 
exam finding meeting the Investigator ’s or Sponsor’s criteria for clinical significance will be 
recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate (see section  14.1.1, Adverse Events and section  14.1.2, 
Serious Adverse Events ). 
At screening, the Investigator will also assess the subject’s skin type using the Fitzpatrick scale 
(Table 11). Only the Fitzpatrick Scale shown below may be used during the study. 
Table 10: Fitzpatrick Scale  
I Pale white skin, blue/hazel eyes, blond/red hair  Always burns, does not tan 
II Fair skin, blue eyes  Burns easily, tans poorly 
III Darker white skin  Tans after initial burn  
IV Light brown skin  Burns minimally, tans easily  
V Brown skin  Rarely burns, tans darkly easily  
VI Dark brown or black skin  Never burns, always tans darkly  
Follow-up body weight will be measured before injection on Day 22 and Day 43 and at the 
Day 71 visit.

   17.2.2. Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT population is defined as all randomized subjects who have received at least one 
injection of study medication. All demographic and baseline characteristic summaries will be 
based on this population. The primary and key secondary efficacy parameters will be 
summa rized based on this population. 
17.2.3. Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population 
The mITT population is defined as all intent- to-treat subjects with a baseline and at least 1 
post-injection evaluation of both the Investigator CR-PCSS and subject PR- PCSS for both left 
and right buttocks. All secondary and supportive efficacy evaluations will be based on the mITT population. 
17.2.4. Per-Protocol (PP) Population 
The per -protocol population is defined as the mITT subjects without any major protocol 
deviation that will impact the subject’s efficacy and safety. This population may be used in the 
efficacy sensitivity analysis.  
17.3. Subject Disposition  
The number of subjects included in each study population will be summarized by treatment group. Subjects excluded from the safety and efficacy (eg, ITT) populations will be listed by treatment group.  
The number and percentage of subjects completed and prematurely discontinued during the treatmen t period will be presented for each treatment group and pooled across treatment groups. 
Screen failures (ie, screened but not randomized subjects) and the associated failure reasons will 
be tabulated overall. Reasons for premature discontinuation from the treatment period as 
recorded on the termination page of the eCRF will be summarized (number and percentage) by treatment group for all randomized subjects. Percentage of premature discontinuations will be 
compared between treatment groups.  
17.4. Demographics and  Other Baseline Characteristics  
The summarization of demographic variables (eg, age, sex, race, weight, height, and body mass 
index [ BMI]), medical and surgical history, and other baseline characteristics relevant to the 
indication studied in the study will be described. 
Demographic characteristics, including sex, age, age group, race, height, and weight, will be 
summarized by treatment group, for the ITT population, using descriptive statistics. All screening characteristics and medical information will  also be summarized by treatment group 
using descriptive statistics. The descriptive summaries will include frequency tables for all categorical response variables and n, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum for all continuous variables.  

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 1 
16-Nov-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 67 
   17.5. Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy endpoints including supportive efficacy analysis will be summarized as percentages. 
The dichotomous secondary endpoints (ie, responder endpoints) will be analyzed using a 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted for Investigator . Changes in the PR-PCSS ratings and 
CR-PCSS ratings from baselines, S -GAIS scores, and I -GAIS scores will be analyzed using the 
Wilcoxon rank sum test. All the tests are two -sided. 
The primary endpoint will be summarized as percentages and analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test that compares the 2 treatment groups and adjusts for Investigator at a level of 
significance of 0.05 based on the ITT population. Any subject who does not have an evaluation 
of CR -PCSS and/or PR- PCSS at Day 71 will be classified as a non -responder. 
The key secondary efficacy analyses will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary 
endpoint based on the ITT population. Any subject who does not have an evaluation at Day 71 
will be classified as a non -responder for the analyses. The family #1 key secondary efficacy 
analyses will be performed only if the primary efficacy analysis is significant ( p ≤ 0.05; 
gatekeeping strategy). Similarly family #2 key secondary efficacy analyses will be performed only if at least one of the key secondary efficacy endpoints of family #1 is significant ( p ≤ 0.025; 
parallel gatekeeping strategy). Within a family of key secondary efficacy endpoints, Bonferroni’ s 
method will be performed to relocate unused alpha for testing each endpoint to assure an overall error rate of p ≤ 0.05. The details of the testing procedures will be provided in the statistical 
analysis plan for the study. 
All supportive endpoints will be summarized as subject counts and percentages  for categorical 
data or n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous data. All the supportive 
analyses will be performed based on all observed data (ie, missing data not imputed) in the mITT population at all visits without multiplicity adjustment. This analysis will also be performed at 
Day 71 with missing data at Day 71 imputed by a last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
approach if subjects have at least one post-dose assessment. The dichotomous secondary endpoints (ie, responder endpoints) will be analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test 
adjusted for Investigator . Changes in the PR-PCSS ratings and CR- PCSS ratings from baselines, 
S-GAIS scores, and I -GAIS scores will be analyzed us ing the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Changes 
in PR- CIS from b aselines will be analyzed using an  analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA) adjusted 
for baseline values.  
17.5.1. Primary Efficacy Variable 
The primary efficacy variable is the proportion of 2-level composite responders at Day 71 defined as subjects with at least one of two treated buttocks with: 
• an improvement in severity from baseline (Day 1 visit) of at least 2 levels of severity in the CR- PCSS as assessed live by the Investigator, and   
• an improvement in severity from baseline of at least 2  levels of severity in the 
PR-PCSS by the subject while viewing the digital image of the same buttock. 
A subject will be considered a responder if these criteria are met in either the left buttock or right buttock or both buttocks in that subject. In other words, a subject will be considered a responder 
if she has an improvement of at least 2 levels  on the PR-PCSS and an improvement of at least 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 1 
16-Nov-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 68 
   2 levels  on the CR-PCSS on that same buttock; that buttock could be the left buttock or right 
buttock or both buttocks. 
Sensitivity analyses  for the primary endpoint will include: 
• ITT subjects with missing data handled by multiple imputation (MI) approach 
• ITT subjects with missing data handled by an LOCF approach 
• mITT subjects with missing data handled by an LOCF approach  
• Observed data only (no missing data handling) 
• Per-protocol (PP) subjects with missing data handled by an LOCF approach if 10% or 
more subjects are excluded in the PP population from mITT population 
17.5.2. Secondary Efficacy Variables 
17.5.2.1. Key Secondary Variables 
There will be 4 key second ary endpoints grouped in two families of 2 endpoints per family

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 1 
16-Nov-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 72 
   17.6.1. Prior, Concomitant, and Follow- up Medication  
The World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary will be used to classify prior and 
concomitant medications by thera peutic class. Prior medication will be defined as any 
medication taken prior to the first dose of study drug. Concomitant medication is defined as any medication taken on or after the da te of first dose of study drug.  
Prior and concomitant medication use will be summarized descriptively by the number and 
percentage of subjects for each preferred term (generic name from WHO dictionary) by 
treatment. Multiple use of the same medication by a subject will be counted only once. 
17.6.2. Study Drug Exposure  
The following information regarding treatment will be summarized per each treated buttock by 
treatment group:  
• Total number of treatment visits  
• Number of subjects who had treatment session done or treatment session not done at each treatment visit  
• For subjects who had the treatment session done, the number of subjects who got all 24 injections at the treatment visit or who received less than 24 injections 
• Number of injections given at each treatment visit  
• Number of dimples treated at each treatment visit  
• Average numbe r of injections per dimple at each treatment visit  
Subjects who did not receive all 3 treatment visits and who did not receive 24 injections at a 
treatment visit will be listed.  
17.6.3. Measurement of Treatment Compliance  
Not applicable (the study drug is adminis tered at the site by the study investigator).  
17.6.4. Adverse Events  
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be used to code AEs.  
An AE (classified by preferred term) that started on or after the date of the first dose of the study drug will  be considered a TEAE if it was not present prior to the first dose of study drug, or was 
present prior to the first dose of study drug but increased in intensity during the treatment period. If more than 1 AE is reported prior to the first dose of study drug and coded to the same preferred term, then the AE with the greatest intensity will be used as the benchmark for 
comparison to the AEs occurring during the treatment period which were also coded to that 
preferred term. Any AE present prior to the first dose of study drug that increases in intensity during the treatment period will be re -entered with a new start date of the date of increased 
intensity.  
Descriptive statistics (the number and percentage) for subjects reporting TEAEs in each treatment group will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term; by system organ 
class, preferred term, and severity; and by system organ class, preferred term, and relationship to 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 1 
16-Nov-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 73 
   study drug. If more than 1 AE is coded to the same preferred term for the same subject, the 
subject will be counted only once for that preferred term using the most severe and most related 
occurrence for the summarization by severity and by relationship to the study drug. 
The by -frequency summaries will also include incidence of the SAEs and non- SAEs by preferred 
term that at least 2% of the subjects in one treatment group. Duration of AEs will be tabulated by 
treatment group.  
Fisher’s Exact test will be use d to compare EN3835 to placebo. 
Listings will be presented for subjects with SA Es, subjects with AEs leading to discontinuation 
of study or study drug, and subjects who die (if any). 
17.6.5. Vital Signs  
Descriptive statistics for vital signs (eg, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and 
body weight) and their changes from basel ine at each visit and at the end of study will b e 
presented by treatment group. 
Vital sign values are potentially clinically important (PCI) if they meet both the observed value 
criteria and the change from baseline criteria. The criteria for PCI vital sig n values will be 
detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The PCI percentages will be calculated relative to the number of subjects with baseline and at least one post- baseline assessment. A supportive 
listing of subject values will be provided including the subject ID, study center, treatment group, 
baseline and post- baseline values.  
The change from baseline for vital signs parameters are compared between EN3835 and placebo 
using an analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with a factor of drug (EN3835 or placebo) while 
Fisher’s exact test will be used for the incidence of PCI values.  
17.6.6. Clinical Laboratory Parameters  
Descriptive statistics for clinical laboratory values in International System of Units (SI units) and changes from baseline at Day 71 will be presented by treatment group for each clinical 
laboratory parameter.  
The number and percentage of subjects with potentially clinically important (PCI) post- baseline 
clinical laboratory values will be tabulated by treatment group. The criteria for PCI labor atory 
values will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The PCI percentages will be 
calculated relative to the number of subjects with at least one post -baseline assessment. A 
supportive listing of subjects with post- baseline PCI values will be provided, including the 
subject ID, study center, treatment group, baseline and post- baseline values.  
The change from baseline for clinical laboratory parameters are compared between EN3835 and placebo using an ANOVA with a factor of drug (EN3835 or pla cebo) while Fisher’s exact test 
will be used for the incidence of PCI values.  
17.6.7. Electrocardiogram  
Not applicable (ECG is done only at screening for the subject’s enrollment eligibility) . 

EN3835-302 Protocol Amendment 1 
16-Nov-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 74 
   17.6.8. Physical Examination 
Body weight and BMI at Day 22, Day 43, and Day 71 as well as their change from baseline 
(Day  1) at those time points will be presented by treatment group . 
17.6.9. Other Safety Measurements  
Not applicable.  
17.7. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Not applicable. 
17.8. Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
Not applicable. 
17.9. Other Data (eg , Health Economics/QOL, Pharmacogenetic, etc) 
Not applicable. 
17.10.  Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is planned for this study. 
17.11.  Statistical Software

   22. DATA HANDLING AND RE CORDKEEPING  
22.1. Data Collection  
Endo will provide an electronic data capture (EDC) system for this study. Data collection will 
involve the use of an EDC system to which only authorized personnel will have access. The system will be secured to prevent unauthorized access to the data or the system. This w ill include 
the requirement for a user ID and password to enter or change data. The level of access to the EDC system will be dependent on the person’s role in the study. 
Study data will be collected from source documents and entered into an eCRF within the EDC 
system. The Investigator will be responsible for ensuring the eCRFs are completed in a timely 
manner relative to the subject’s visit. In addition to periodic monitoring occurring within the system by a Sponsor monitor, programmatic edit checks will b e used to review EDC data for 
completeness, logic, and adherence to the study protocol. As a result of this monitoring and these checks, queries may be issued electronically to the clinical study sites and closed electronically by the monitor, data managem ent staff or authorized staff at the study site. Additionally, the 
Investigator will review eCRFs, ensure all missing or corrected data is provided and will sign the eCRF page s with an electronic signature.  
An electronic audit trail will be maintained in the EDC system to track all changes made to data 
entered in the eCRF. Data will be retrievable in such a fashion that all information regarding 
each individual subject is attributable to that subject. Unless otherwise indicated, all data captured in the eCRF must first be captured in source documents. Data that can be directly 
recorded in the eCRF will be clearly identified in the section(s) of the protocol that describes the 
assessment(s).  
Data entries will be corrected by changing the entry in the EDC system. Any changes or 
corrections to eCRF data will be electronically tracked and will include the reason for correction, 
who made the correction and the date/time stamp when the correction was made within the audit trail of the EDC system.  
In addition, any c ontact with the subject via telephone or other means that provide significant 
clinical information must be documented in source documents as described above. 
22.2. Study Documentation  
Upon study completion, the Investigator will be provided with complete electronic copies of the 
case report form (CRF)  data for his/her files .

Name of Sponsor/Company : Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
Name of Investigational Product : EN3835 
Name of Active Ingredient : Collagenase clostridium histolyticum  
Title of Study : A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo- Controlled Study of EN3835 in the 
Treatment of Edematous Fibrosclerotic Panniculopathy 
Lead Principal Investigator:  
Study Period :  
Estimated date first subject enrolled:  J an-2018 
Estimated date last subject completed:  S ep-2018 Phase of Development : 3 
Objectives :  
To assess the efficacy and safety of EN3835 in the treatment of edematous fibrosclerotic panniculopathy 
(EFP), commonly known as cellulite, in adult women  
Study Design: This study is a Phase 3 randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled study of the 
efficacy and safety of EN3835 in the treatment of EFP in adult women. Subjects will be screened for 
study eligibility within 14 days prior to enrolling in this study. Subjects with 2  treatment areas (bilateral 
buttocks) (also referred to as quadrants) with  moderate or severe levels of cellulite as independently 
assessed by the subject using the Patient Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (PR -PCSS) 
and by the I nvestigator using the Clinician Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR -PCSS)  
and a Hexsel Cellulite Severity Scale no greater than 13 will be eligible. The eligibility of the butto cks 
will be confirmed on Day 1. 
Once the eligibility of the buttocks is confirmed, subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment 
group (EN3835 0.84 mg per buttock or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio within an investigational site. Each 
subject will receive a treatment course which consists of up to 3 treatment visits (sessions), separated by 
21 days (ie, Days 1, 22, and 43). Each treatment visit will consist of 12 injections (0.3 mL per injection 
of EN3835 0.07 mg/injection or placebo; 0.84 mg in 3.6 mL per buttock) in each of the two buttocks for a total volume of 7.2 mL (1.68 mg). Selection of dimples to be treated in the buttocks will be at the 
discretion of the Investigator. End of study will occur at study day 71.  
At each treatment visit, each of the buttocks will be photographed before and after marking dimples and 
injection sites while the subject is in a consistent , standardized  relaxed standing pose. The subject will 
assess the digital photographic image (pre-marking) of each of the buttocks using the PR- PCSS to 
determine the severity of EFP in each of the buttocks. In addition, the subject will evaluate each of the buttocks usi ng a Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (S -GAIS). Subsequently, the Investigator  
will conduct live assessments of each buttock using the CR -PCSS. The subject assessments will always 
be completed prior to and independently of the Investigator assess ments at each treatment visit. In 
addition, the Investigator  will assess each of the buttocks using an Investigator Global Aesthetic 
Improvement Scale (I -GAIS). All of the assessments must be done before the dimple marking.  
At Day 71 (End of Study/Early Te rmination), photographs of each of the buttocks will be taken and 
evaluated by subject using the PR- PCSS. The Investigator  will conduct live assessments of each of the 
buttocks using the CR-PCSS. Global assessment evaluations will be completed by both the subject and 
the Investigator .

Analyses:  
Analyses of Primary Endpoint: 
The primary endpoint is the proportion of 2- level composite responders at Day 71 defined as subjects 
with at least one of two treated buttocks with:  
• an improvement in severity from baseline (Day 1 visit) of at least 2 levels of severity in the 
CR-PCSS as assessed live by the Investigator, and 
• an improvement in severity from baseline of at least 2  levels of severity in the PR -PCSS as 
assessed by the subject while viewing the digital image of the same buttock.  
A subject will be considered a responder if these criteria are met in the left buttock or right buttock or 
both buttocks in that subject. 
The primary endpoint will be summarized as percentages and analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test that compares the 2 treatment groups and adjusts for Investigator at a level of significance 
of 0.05. The ITT population will be evaluated for the primary  endpoint with any subject not having an 
evaluation of CR- PCSS and/or PR- PCSS at Day 71 classified as a non -responder. 
Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint will include:  
• ITT subjects with missing data handled by multiple imputation (MI) approach 
• ITT subjects with missing data handled by a last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach  
• mITT subjects with missing data handled by an LOCF approach  
• Observed data only (no missing data imputed) 
• Per-protocol (PP) subjects with missing data handled by an LOCF approach if 10% or more 
subjects are excluded in the PP population from mITT population. 
Analyses of Key Secondary Endpoints :  
There will be 4 key secondary endpoints grouped as two families of 2 endpoints per family analyzed in a hierarchical order.  
• Family #1 – two endpoints: 
- Proportion of 1- level PR -PCSS responders defined as subjects with ≥1- level 
improvement in PR-PCSS severity rating of left buttock at Day 71 compared to Day 1 
- Proportion of 1- level PR -PCSS responders defined as subjects with ≥1-l evel 
improvement in PR-PCSS severity rating of right buttock at Day 71 compared to Day 1 
• Family #2 – two endpoints: - Proportion of 1- level S -GAIS responders defined as subjects with ≥1- level 
improvement (improved, much improved or very much improved) in the S- GAIS 
assessment of left buttock at Day 71  
- Proportion of 1- level S -GAIS responders defined as subjects with ≥1- level 
improvement (improved, much improved or very much improved) in the S- GAIS 
assessment of right buttock at Day 71

The key secondary efficacy analyses will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary endpoint based 
on the ITT population. The family #1 key secondary efficacy analyses will be performed only if the primary efficacy analysis is significant at a significance level of p ≤ 0.05 (gatekeeping strategy). 
Similarly, family #2 key secondary efficacy analyses will be performed only if at least one of the key secondary efficacy endpoints of family #1 is significant at a significance level of p  ≤ 0.025 (parallel 
gatekeeping strategy). Within a family of key secondary efficacy endpoints, Bonferroni ’s method will be 
performed to relocate unused alpha for testing each endpoint to assure an overall error rate of p ≤ 0.05. 
The details of the testing procedures will be provided in the statistical analysis plan for the study.

• Proportion of 1- level I -GAIS responders (defined as subjects with a response of at least 1 
(improved) in the Investigator GAIS assessment) of at least one buttock (Days 22, 43, and 71). A subject will be considered a responder if this criterion is met in the left buttock or right buttock or both buttocks in that subject.  
• Proportion of 1- level I -GAIS responders of two buttocks in the same individual (Days 22, 
43, and 71). A subject will be considered a responder if this criterion is met in both left and 
right buttocks.  
• Proportion of subjects at each level of the subject satisfaction with cellulite treatment 
(Day  71) 
• Proportion of satisfied responders (defined as subjects with a response of at least 1  
(ie, 1-Satisfied or 2 -Very Satisfied) in the subject satisfaction with cellulite treatment 
assessment (Day 71)

All supportive endpoints will be summ arized as percentages. The dichotomous secondary endpoints 
(ie, responder endpoints) will be analyzed using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted for 
Investigator. Changes in the PR -PCSS ratings and CR -PCSS ratings from baselines, S -GAIS scores, and 
I-GAIS scores will be analyzed using the Mann -Whitney test.  
Safety Analysis : 
The following variables are safety endpoints:  
• AEs: Mapped to preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA)  
• Vital signs  
• Clinical laboratory tests  
AEs will be summarized by proportion of subjects reporting each event. Fisher’s Exact test will be used to compare EN3835 to placebo. Descriptive statistics will be presented for actual and change from baseline at each visit for vital signs and for each cl inical laboratory test parameter. The comparison 
between treatment groups will be based on the change from baseline for clinical laboratory tests and vital signs using an analysis of variance (ANOVA)  with a factor of drug (EN3835 or placebo). 
Immunogenicity : Anti -AUX -I and anti- AUX -II antibody levels will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics for the actual value at the visit. Samples from Day 1, Day 22, Day 43, and Day 71 visits will be 
analyzed for anti -AUX -I and anti- AUX -II antibodies and a subset of Day 1 and Day 71 samples will be 
analyzed for neutralizing antibodies.

   8. INTRODUCTION 
8.1. Background  
8.1.1. Edematous Fibrosclerotic Panniculopathy  
Edematous fibrosclerotic panniculopathy (EFP), commonly known as cellulite, has been defined 
as a local metabolic disorder of subcutaneous tissues that results in a contour abnormality of the skin.( 1) The condition manifests as dimpled skin, particularly in the gluteal -femoral region. (2,3) 
EFP is caused by herniation of subcutaneous fat lobules through the dermohypodermal junction and/or shortening of the collagen septa that cross the hypodermal layer and connects the dermis to the underlying fascia. This creates an uneven surface with dimpling.( 1,2) EFP is a medical 
condition resulting in a potentially cosmetically unacceptable alteration of the skin, and affects an estimated 85% to 98% of postpubertal women.( 1,3) 
The pathophysiology of EFP is not completely understood, but there are 3 main theories: edema 
resulting from excessive hydrophilia of the intercellular matrix, alteration of the regional 
microcirculation, and different anatomical conformation of collagenous subcutaneous tissues in women versus men.( 4) 
It is known that EFP is different from generalized obesity. In generalized obesity, adipocytes 
undergo hypertrophy and hyperplasia that are not limited to the pelvis, thighs, and abdomen.( 1) 
In areas of EFP, adipocytes have physiologic and biochemical properties that differ from adipose 
tissue located elsewhere. Large, metabolically -stable adipocytes characterize EFP -prone areas; 
thus, the responsiveness to catecholamine-induced lipolysis is less in EFP tissues compared to 
visceral fat, which has the greatest responsiveness.( 1) 
Subcutaneous fat lobes are separated from one another by thin, usually rigid strands of collagenous connective tissues, which cross the fatty layers and connect the dermis to the underlying fascia. These septa stabilize the subcutis and divide the fat. In EFP, shortening of the 
collagen septa due to fibrosis provokes retraction at the insertion points of the trabeculae, 
causing the depressions that characterize EFP. (2) There are a higher percentage of thinner, 
perpendicular hypodermal septa in women with EFP than in men.( 1) Weight gain makes EFP 
more noticeable, but it may be present even in thin subjects. Genetics may also play a role sinc e 
EFP tends to run in families.  
8.1.2. Current EFP Treatments  
There are therapies that have been utilized in an attempt to treat cellulite; however, there are no 
approved pharmacologic treatments. Despite multiple therapeutic modalities, there is little 
scientific evidence that any of these treatments are beneficial. In fact, much of the evidence is anecdotal, subjective, or based only on patient self- assessment.( 5) Some of the historical 
treatments for EFP have included weight loss,( 6) topical agents ,(5) massage, (7) liposuction,( 5,6) 
mesotherapy ,(6) radiofrequency,( 6) subcision and powered subcision,( 8) and laser 
therapies ;(9,10) some of these treatments may pose an increased risk for adverse effects. (5)

   There remains an unmet medical need for safe and effective therapies to improve the aesthetic 
outcome in women with cellulite. To effectively treat cellulite, a therapeutic approach may 
require disruption of the dermal septa, which are composed of collagen and cause the skin 
dimpling th at is bothersome to many women. 
8.1.3. EN3835 (Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum) 
Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Endo) is developing EN3835 for the treatment of EFP. Because 
EN3835 is a proteinase that can hydrolyze the triple- helical regi on of collagen under 
physiological conditions, EN3835 has the potential to be effective in lysing subdermal collagen, 
such as those observed in the dermal septa, which are the underlying cause of the skin dimpling 
in women with EFP. EN3835 targets the coll agenase structural matrix (eg, dermal septa) at the 
site of injection and does not require systemi c exposure to be effective.  
EN3835 is a parenteral lyophilized product comprised of 2 collagenases in an approximate 1:1 mass ratio, Collagenase I (AUX -I, Clostridial class I collagenase) and Collagenase II (AUX -II; 
Clostridial class II collagenase). These collagenases are isolated and purified from the 
fermentation of Clostridium histolyticum . 
Collagenase AUX -I is a single polypeptide chain containing approximately 1,000 amino acids of 
known sequence and with a molecular weight of 114 kDa. Collagenase AUX- II is also 
approximately 1,000 amino acids long and has a molecular weight of 113 kDa. These 
2 collagenases are not immunologically cross -reactive and have different specificities, such that 
together they become synergistic, providing a very broad hydrolyzing reactivity toward collagen. 
Clostridial collagenases are proteinases that can hydrolyze the triple-helical region of collagen 
under physiological conditions. 
EN3835 is currently approved (brand name is XIAFLEX
®) for: 1) the treatment of adults with 
Dupuytren’s contracture with a palpable cord and, 2) for the treatment of adult men with 
Peyronie’s disease with a palpable plaque and curvature deformity of at least 30 ° at the start of 
therapy.  
A recent Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (EN3835-201) of 375 women randomized to treatment of one treatment area (quadrant) (quadrant was defined in 
study EN3835-201 as a left buttock, a right buttock, a left posterolateal thigh or a right posterolateral thigh) of cellulite with EN3835 0.84 mg or placebo in a 1:1 ratio assessed the 
effectiveness and safety of EN3835. Efficacy in this study was evaluated based on cellulite 
assessments using C linician Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR -PCSS), Patient 
Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (PR -PCSS), Investigator Global Aesthetic 
Improvement Scale (GAIS -I), Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS -S), and 
Subject Satisfaction with Cellulite Treatment.  
Results from the Phase 2b study demonstrated that treatment (3 visits approximately 21 days 
apart) improved the cellulite severity of the treatment area as assessed by the primary endpoint of 
2-level composite responder analyses, the proportion of responders based on an improvement of ≥2 levels in the appearance of cellulite in both the patient PR -PCSS and the clinician CR -PCSS 
of buttocks and thighs was statistically significantly greater in subjects who received EN3835 0.84 mg (10.6%; p <0.001) compared to subjects who received placebo (1.6%); 1- level (or 
greater) responders in the PR-PCSS of EN3835-treated subjects (72.3%) was significantly 

EN3835-302 Protocol 
14-Sep-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 25 
   greater than 1 -level responders in the placebo group (51.6%) ( p<0.001); statistically significant 
(p≤0.001) improvement in the appearance of cellulite based on the subject S -GAIS were 
observed in EN3835 0.84- mg group (73.1%) compared to the placebo group (44.0%); and 62.9% 
of subjects in the EN3835 0.84 mg group were satisfied or ve ry satisfied with the results of their 
cellulite treatment compared with only 35.9% of subjects in the placebo group ( p<0.001). In 
subjects treated in buttocks (n=187), the proportion of 2-level composite responders was 
statistically significantly greater in subjects who received EN3835 0.84 mg (14.9%; p<0.001) compared to subjects who received placebo (1.1%); 1-level (or greater) responders in the 
PR-PCSS of EN3835-treated subjects (72.7%) was significantly greater than 1- level responders 
in the placebo group (47.8%) ( p<0.001). 
The study also demonstrated EN3835 to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events (SAEs) related to EN3835. Safety results from a total of 4 studies (1 pilot, 2 Phase 1, and 2 Phase 2 
studies) in which 435 adult females received subcutaneous injections of EN3835 indicate that the majority of treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) are transient, non-serious, mild or 
moderate in intensit y, and related to the local administration of EN3835. The immunogenicity 
profile after 3 treatment visits of EN3835 indicate that greater than 90% of EN3835- treated 
subjects were seropositive for AUX-I and/or AUX-II antibodies; this profile of EN3835 is 
similar to that observed in the Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease programs. 
A Phase 1, open-label safety and pharmacokinetic study of a single dose of EN3835 0.84 mg in 
11 female subjects with EFP showed that there was no quantifiable levels of AUX- I or AUX -II 
at any time  point after subcutaneous injection of EN3835 0.84 mg into one quadrant. A second 
Phase 1, open-label safety and pharmacokinetic study of a single dose of EN3835 0.84 mg per treatment area in two treatment areas (buttock -buttock, thigh -thigh, or buttock- thigh) 
concurrently (total dose of 1.68 mg) showed that there was no quantifiable levels of AUX- I or 
AUX- II at any time  point post-dose attributable  to the injection of EN3835 1.68 mg.  
The results from these studies suggest that subcutaneous injections of EN3835 in the area of 
cellulite may be a well- tolerated and effective medical  treatment for adults with EFP.  
8.2. Summary of Nonclinical Studies  
Non-clinical studies necessary to support clinical studies have been performed and are 
summarized in the Investigator Brochure (IB).( 11) Non -clinical studies in the following areas 
were performed: toxicology, reprotoxicity, genotoxicity, and hypersensitivity. 
8.3. Summary of Known Risks and Benefits  
A summary of safety risks is provided in the IB.( 11) The following events have been commonly 
observed: local injection site reactions (injection site bruising, injection site swelling, injection 
site pain) for the various approved indications as well as those being investigated. In the phase 
2b study of EN3835 in women with EFP, the following treatment related adverse events ≥2% of 
189 EN3835-treated women were reported: injection site bruising (75.1%), injection site pain (59.3%), injection site nodule (14.3%), injection site pruritus (11.1%), injection site swelling 
(7.4%), injection site induration (5.8%), injection site mass (5.3%), injection site discolouration 
(3.2%), and injection site erythema (2.1%). These events are similar to events reported in the clinical trials of EN3835 for the approved indications. Postmarket ing safety data are consistent 
with safety data reported in clinical trials.  

EN3835-302 Protocol 
14-Sep-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 26 
   Although a thorough benefit of EN3835 has not been fully evaluated in the treatment of EFP, the 
efficacy results from the Phase 2b study and previous EFP studies warranted further 
development. 
8.4. Ratio nale 
The results from the Phase 2b EFP study (EN3835-201) further suggested that EN3835 0.84 mg 
per treatment area (quadrant) is an effective treatment of EFP based on improvement in the 
severity of cellulite as determined by the Investigator and the subje ct. There were no safety 
concerns following 0.84 mg per treatment area in the treatment of EFP ( section  8.1.3). Safety 
findings from the Phase 2b EFP study are similar to that observed in previous clinical studies with EN3835 in the treatment of EFP and XIAFLEX in the treatment of Dupuytren’s contrac ture 
and Peyronie’s disease, in that that the majority of AEs occurred at the site of injection and 
resolved before the next scheduled treatment. The immunogenicity profile of EN3835 in the 
Phase 2b EFP study is similar in previous studies and programs. 
Based on the efficacy and safety findings from the Phase 2a and 2b EFP studies, the EN3835 
0.84- mg dose per treatment area in two treatment areas (buttocks) warranted further investigation 
in this study.  
Treating two buttocks at each treatment visit will potentially provide a symmetrical -like 
improvement in appearance. Support for evaluation of the treatment of two buttocks concurrently 
is based on: 1) the safety findings from the previous EFP studies are local to the injection site, 
2) the pharmacological activity of EN3835 is local and does not require systemic exposure, and 3) no significant quantifiable systemic concentration has been attributable to injection of two 
buttocks concurrently. 
The integration of dose and use justification supports this study of evaluation of EN3835 
0.84 mg per treatment area in two treatment areas (buttocks) concurrently.

10.2. Selection of Doses  
The dose of EN3835 chosen for this study was based on the results from earlier studies.  
The data from the Phase 2a EFP dose- ranging study (AUX -CC-831) suggest that EN3835 
0.84 mg is most effective in the treatment of EFP based on improvement in the severity of 

EN3835-302 Protocol 
14-Sep-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 29 
   cellulite as determined by both the Investigator and the subject, although the EN3835 0.48- mg 
group did show improvement in s ome of the efficacy parameters.  
• There were no safety concerns following administration of up to 3 treatment visits of 
EN3835 0.84 mg in the treatment of EFP (AUX- CC-831 CSR). The safety profile of 
EN3835 0.84 mg in the treatment of EFP was similar to that observed in the EN3835 0.06-mg group and the EN3835 0.48-mg group. No notable differences were observed acr oss the 3 treatment groups. 
• Safety findings from the Phase 2a EFP dose- ranging study are similar to that 
observed in previous clinical studies with XIAFLEX in the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease, in that the majority of AEs occu rred at the site of 
injection and resolved before the next scheduled treatment. 
• The immunogenicity profile of EN3835 in the Phase 2a EFP dose- ranging study is 
similar to that observed in the Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease 
programs. 
• Based on  the efficacy and safety findings from the Phase 2a EFP dose- ranging study, 
the EN3835 0.84-mg dose was carried forward to the Phase 2b study. 
The results from the Phase 2b EFP study (EN3835-201) further suggested that EN3835 0.84 mg is an effective treatm ent of EFP based on improvement in the severity of cellulite as determined 
by the Investigator and the subject . There were no safety concerns following EN3835 0.84 mg 
in the treatment of EFP ( section  8.4). Safety findings from the Phase 2b EFP study are similar to 
that observed in previous clinical studies with XIAFLEX in the treatment of Dupuytren’s 
contracture and Peyronie’s disease, in that that the majority of AEs occurred at the site of injection and resolved before the next scheduled treatment. The immunogenicity profile of 
EN3835 in the Phase 2b EFP study is similar to that observed in the Dupuytren’s contracture 
and Peyronie’s disease programs. 
Based on the efficacy and safety findings from the Phase 2a and 2b EFP studies, the EN3835 
0.84- mg dose per treatment area was carried forward to this study . The findings from previous 
studies that the majority of adverse events after EN3835 treatment are local to the injection site 
and that there is no quantifiable systemic exposure observed after concurrent treatment of two 
buttocks (total dose of 1.68 mg) supports the proposed study to evaluate EN3835 treatment of 
two buttocks. 
10.3. Study Drug Administrat ion 
Study drug will be injected subcutaneously while the subject is in a prone position using a 
syringe with a 30 -gauge ½ -inch needle. Each injection site will receive a single skin injection of 
study drug administered as three 0.1-mL aliquots to Positions A, B, and C (for a total injection 
volume of 0.3 mL) as shown in the following figure. The depth of injection corresponds to the 
length of the treatment needle (0.5 inches) from the tip of the needle to the hub or base of the 
needle without downward press ure. 
During each treatment visit, 8 syringes (4 syringes per buttock) will be prepared for dosing. Each 
syringe will contain 0.9 mL of study drug (ie, 3 injections in each syringe). Twelve (12) skin 

EN3835-302 Protocol 
14-Sep-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 31 
   10.4. Care Procedures After Injection  
To evaluate the subject for possible immediate immunological AEs, the subject will remain in 
direct observation of medical personnel who are skilled in the management of an allergic 
reaction for 30 minutes after receiving the injection s of study drug and until the subject exhibits 
no sign of an immunological or other clinically significant systemic or local AE. The subject’s 
vital signs should be stable before the subject can leave direct observation (see s ection  14.9).  
The Investigator or qualified designee will then apply a sterile dressing to the injection areas with hypoallergenic tape. The subject will be instructed to remove the dressing in the evening. 
10.5. Discussion of Study Design, Including the Choice of Control Groups  
The design of this study was based on the primary objective to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EN3835 0.84 mg per buttock in the concurrent treatment (total dose of 1.68 mg) of 2 bilateral 
buttocks with EFP in adult women compared with placebo treatment. The study design, a 
multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is in accordance with regulatory guidelines of adequate and well -controlled clinical studies (Food and Drug Administration [ FDA ] Guidance 
for Industry: Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological 
Products, 1998.; ICH E8 and E10).

11.3. Subject Discontinuation Criteria  
A premature discontinuation will occur when a subject who signed informed consent ceases participation in the study, regardless of circumstances, prior to the completion of the protocol. Subjects can be prematurely discontinued from the study for one of the following reasons: 
• An adverse event  
• Lack of efficacy  
• A protocol violation (reason must be specified, for example: lack of compliance, use 
of a prohibited concomitant medication, failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria after study entry, etc) 
• Withdrawal by subject (reason must be specified) 
• The subject was “lost to follow -up” 
• Other reasons (reason must be specified, for example: the subject moved, pregnancy, 
Investigator decision, Sponsor decision to terminate trial, etc) 
If a subject discontinues from the study, all end-of-study procedures including safety and 
efficacy assessments should be conducted as detailed in the Schedule of Events (section  5). The 
date a subject discontinues and the reason for discontinuation will be recorded in the source 
documentation and electronic case report form  (eCRF). If, however, a subject withdraws consent, 
no end-of-study procedures and assessments are required (but are encouraged to reduce missing 
information) except the collection of adverse event (AE) information. This information should be 
recorded in the source documentation and the eCRF. 
11.3.1. Replacement Procedures  
Subjects who discontinue from the study will not be replaced. 

EN3835-302 Protocol 
14-Sep-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 35 
   12. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
12.1. Study Visits 
The Sched ule of Events to be performed at each visit is shown in section 5. Provided below are 
further details where additional instruction about the assessments that will be performed is 
deemed to be needed.  
12.1.1. Informed Consent  
Signed and dated informed consent will be obtained from each subject before any study procedures are undertaken, or before any changes to the subject’s medication regimen are made. Details about how the informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in 
section  21.3, Subject Information and Consent. 
12.1.2. Subject Screening  
Investigators will be expected to maintain a Screening log of all potential study subjects. This log 
will inclu de limited information about the potential subject and the date and outcome of the 
screening process (eg, enrolled into the study, reason for ineligibility, or refused to participate). Investigators will provide information about the study to subjects who appear to meet the criteria for participation in the study. The screening log will be captured directly by the electronic data 
capture (EDC ) system.  
12.1.2.1. Medical History  
During the screening period, the Investigator or qualified designee will obtain a medical history from each subject that includes relevant diagnoses and/or procedures/therapies with 
onset/resolutions dates. Medical histories should also include history of EFP (start date and 
family history), and history of tobacco and alcohol use (never, current , former).  
12.1.2.2. Screening Period (Day -14 to Day -1) 
Subjects meeting the relevant eligibility criteria listed in section 11 may be enrolled in the study 
after the nature and purpose of the protocol have been explained and written informed consent to 
participate has been voluntarily provided by the subject or their legally authorized representative.  
The subject identification number will consist of 8 digits. The first 4 digits represent the study 
site number follow ed by a 4 -digit subject number. 
The following procedures will be performed and documented during the screening period: 
1. Obtain written informed consent (s ection  12.1.1) 
2. Evaluate eligibility based on inclusion/exclusion criteria ( section  11.1 and s ection  11.2) 
3. Subject will have digital photographs taken of her two buttocks (s ection  13.1.1) 
4. Subjects will get instruction on the use of the PR- PCSS (s ection  13.1.2.1) 

EN3835-302 Protocol 
14-Sep-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 36 
   5. Prior to Investigator  CR- PCSS or Hexsel CSS assessment, subjects will rate each of their 
two buttocks using the PR- PCSS while viewing their digital images ( section  13.1.2.1); 
the Investigator is blinded to these scores 
6. After the subject has completed the PR -PCSS rating s, the Investigator will conduct live 
assessments of subject’s cellulite severity of each of the two  buttocks using the CR- PCSS 
(section  13.1.2.4); the subject is blin ded to these ratings 
7. After the Investigator has completed the CR -PCSS rating s, the Investigator will conduct 
live evaluation of each of the two  buttocks using the Hexsel CSS; the subject is blinded to 
these ratings. The ratings from the PR -PCSS, CR -PCSS, a nd Hexsel CSS 
(section  13.1.2.6) will be used to assess initial eligibility o f the buttocks for study entry 
8. Medical history including EFP history ( section  12.1.2.1) 
9. Record prior and concomitant medications/procedures (s ection  12.8) 
10. Physical examination including measurement of body weight, height, Fitzpatrick skin 
type ( section  14.11) 
11. Vital sign measurements ( section  14.9) 
12. 12-lead ECG ( section  14.10) 
13. Collection of samples for: 
a. Clinical laboratory testing ( section  14.7) 
b. Serum pregnancy testing (s ection  14.7) 
14. Adverse events ( section  14) 
12.2. Selecting and Marking Dimples during Treatment Visits  
Selection of dimples to be treated in the two buttocks is at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Dimples must be well -defined and evident when the subject is standing in a consistent, 
standardized  relaxed pose (without the use of any manipulation such as skin pinching or muscle 
contraction). Each subject will receive 3 treatment visits of study drug according to randomization unless the buttock is dimple- free (score of 0 on CR -PCSS as reported by the 
Investigator) at Treatment Visit 2 and /or Treatment Visit 3 (a dimple - free buttock at Treatment 
Visit 1 is precluded by the eligibility criteria ); a dimple -free buttock at Treatment Visit 2 and /or 
Treatment Visit 3 does not preclude treatment of the contralateral buttock unless it is dimple- free 
also. During each treatment visit, each of the buttocks will be photographed before and after marking di mples and injection sites while the subject is standing in a consistent, standardized 
relaxed pose as described in the Photography Manual. The cellulite severity assessments using 
the PR -PCSS, CR- PCSS, and Hexsel CSS (note that the Hexsel CSS assessment is  performed at 
Screening visit and Day 1 visit only) will be completed prior to marking dimples and injection 
sites.  
The Investigator or qualified designee will select dimples within each buttock that are well-defined, evident when the subject is standing, and suitable for treatment; treatment consists of 
12 injections per buttock (24 injections total in two buttocks) per treatment visit. Because the 
goal of treatment is to improve the aesthetic appearance of each entire buttock, the Investigator 

EN3835-302 Protocol 
14-Sep-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 37 
   will be ins tructed to select dimples that in his or her opinion would most improve the aesthetic 
appearance of each entire buttock. The same dimples within a buttock or different dimples within 
a buttock may be treated at each treatment visit but injections must all be within the buttocks 
(12 injections per buttock) for all 3 visits. Each buttock will receive all 3  treatment visits unless 
the buttock has no treatable EFP dimples and the Investigator rates the buttock a score of 0 on 
the CR -PCSS. If no injections in a particular buttock (right or left) are given at Treatment Visit 
2, subjects will still be assessed for treatment in the contralateral buttock at Treatment Visit 2, 
and will return for the Day 43 visit and each of the buttocks will again be evaluated by the 
subject (PR -PCSS) and Investigator (CR -PCSS). If the Investigator rates either or both of the 
buttocks greater than 0 on the CR- PCSS, injections at Treatment Visit 3 should be given.  
For each dimple selected for treatment, the Investigator or qualified de signee will choose 
injection sites (injection sites within a dimple should be spaced approximately 2 cm apart, if a 
dimple requires more than 1 injection; locating at least one injection site at the nadir, if present, of the dimple). Each injection site will be marked with a “dot” using a surgical marker. For 
round dimples, the “dot” will be placed in the center of the dimple; for elongated dimples, “dots” 
will be spaced out approximately 2 cm along the longer axis of the dimple. The Investigator or qualifi ed designee will then use a surgical marker to circle each of the dimples selected for 
treatment. Circles in the buttock should not overlap. 
Each of the buttocks will be photographed before and after marking dimples and injection sites 
while the subject is  standing in a consistent , standardized  relaxed pose as described in the 
Photography Manual. 
Examples of subject dimple and injection site markings are shown as follows:

All prior medications taken within 90 days before randomization will be recorded. All medications (including over-the-counter medications) taken by the subject on Day 1 through the 

EN3835-302 Protocol 
14-Sep-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 41 
   end of the study must be recorded. Any prior treatments (medications or procedures) for EFP 
through the end of the study must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. 
Additionally, any diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedures performed during the study 
period should be recorded including the date, indication for and description of the procedure. 
12.8.1. Prohibited Medications or Procedures  
The following medications are prohibited for randomized subjects during the study: 
anticoagulants (warfarin, heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors, Factor X inhibitors) and antiplatelet 
agents (aspirin >150 mg/day and P2Y12 inhibitors, such as clopidogrel), which can cause additional bruising. However the use of aspirin at a dose level of ≤150 mg per day will be 
permitted during study. 
Procedures listed in exclusion criterion #4 (section 11.2, Exclusion Criterion# 4) are prohibited 
for randomized subjects during the study. 
Table 4: Concomitant Medication Restrictions for Subjects d uring the Treatment 
Phase of Study  
Drug Class  Restrictions  
Anticoagulants  Subjects cannot take antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants (except for 
≤150 mg aspirin daily) within 7  days before and 7 days after the dosing 
administration.  
12.9. Treatment Compliance  
Randomized subjects will receive study drug administered by an Investigator at the 
Investigator ’s site.  
Accidental or intentional overdoses should be reported to the Sponsor/designee promptly (see section  14.6.2.1, Overdose). 
12.10.  Blinding and Randomization  
On Day 1, if each of the buttocks again meet the criteria (3 or 4 on the PR- PCSS and CR -PCSS 
and no greater than 13 on Hexsel CSS) the subject will be randomized to a treatment group. The interactive web response system  (IWRS) will randomly assign each subject to a treatment group 
(EN3835 0.84 mg per buttock × two buttocks or placebo) in a 1: 1 ratio within an investigational 
site. The treatment group will remain blinded to the Investigator, subjects, all site personnel, and the sponsor. The IWRS will assign the subject study drug kit numbers associated with the randomized treatment. At Day 22 and 43 visits, the IWRS will again assign the subject study 
drug kit numbers associated with the randomized treatment assigned at Day 1. 
All precautions will be taken to ensure that the blinding of EN3835 and placebo is maintained 
throughout the study peri od. Unblinding will not be permitted by the study site unless it is 
deemed necessary for treatment of a medical emergency. Before breaking the blind, the Investigator should make every attempt to contact the Medical Monitor to discuss the necessity of brea king the blind. The study site will have the ability to immediately determine treatment 
identification in the event of an emergency by using the unblinding function within the IWRS, however, the Medical Monitor must be notified immediately. The Investigator will be required to 

EN3835-302 Protocol 
14-Sep-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 42 
   make a full written explanation of the reason for unblinding the subject and the date. In the event 
that a subject is unblinded prior to contacting the Medical Monitor, the Investigator must provide 
this information in writing to the Medical Monitor as soon as possible. Breaking the blind at the 
investigative site will immediately disqualify the subject from further participation in the study. In addition, the event(s) leading to emergency unblinding must be reported as a n SAE  accordin g 
to instructions in section 14.5.2, Reporting Serious Adverse Events . 
In addition, it may be necessary for the Investigator or qualified designee to unblind a subject as a result of a clinically significant finding noted during safety review by the Investigator, Safety 
Monitor, Medical Monitor and/or qualified designee that might jeopardize subject safety.

   13. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
13.1. Efficacy Measurements  
13.1.1. Digital Photography  
Although digital photographs are not direct efficacy measurements, digital photography will be 
utilized in the assessment of certain efficacy measurements ie to  assess certain cellulite severity 
parameters at specific intervals (see section  5, Schedule of Events) . At the Screening  visit, the 
Investigator or qualified designee will photograph each buttock using a Sponsor-supplied standardized digital camera in a standardized manner. The subject will be standing for each photography session and will be wea ring a standardized photographic garment as described in 
the Photography Manual. The Investigator or qualified designee will photograph each of the two buttocks while the subject is standing in a consistent, standardized relaxed standing pose, ie, standing position with relaxed gluteus muscles, at the following time points:  
• Screening (no markings of dimples or injection s ite) - each  of the two buttocks 
• Before and after marking dimples and injection sites (prior to injections) on Days 1, 22, and 43 - each of the two buttocks 
• During the Day 71 visit (end of study/early termination) (no dimple or injection site 
markings) - each of the t wo buttocks 
All photographs from this study are the property of Endo and may be utilized for clinical 
development, scientific communication, marketing, regulatory purposes, and/or legal 
applications as required/desired by Endo. 
13.1.2. Subject and Investigator Cel lulite Assessments  
Investigator cellulite assessments are independent of the subject assessments. Therefore, all 
subject cellulite assessments must be completed before the Investigator’s cellulite assessments 
are initiated. The subject assessments will be done using a subject-assigned password protected 
electronic p atient  reported outcome ( ePRO ) system and the Investigator and study site personnel 
will not have access to the subject’s assessments or password; the clinician assessment will be 
recorded in an investigator-assigned password protected system and the subject will not have 
access to the Investigator ’s assessments or password. Subject assessments will be done alone 
with no study site personnel in the room. Investigators will be instructed not to verbalize their 
ratings while in the presence of the subject. 
13.1.2.1. Patient -Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (PR -PCSS)  
The PR -PCSS will be conducted for the purpose of assessing the severity of cellulite in the 
buttock. The scale is a 5 -level photonumeric scale developed specifically for patients and used 
by the subject to assess the severity of their cellulite in the  buttocks by viewing digital images of 
each of their buttocks captured by photography at the visit; the ratings range from 0 (None) to 
4 (Severe) with labels and descriptors to aid the subject in the assessments.  

EN3835-302 Protocol 
14-Sep-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 44 
   At Screening and at the beginning of their  visits on Day 1, Day 22, Day 43, and Day 71, subjects 
will have digital photographs taken of each of their two buttocks. Subjects will be given 
instructions in the proper use (Patient Instructions for Use of PR- PCSS)  of the PR- PCSS and 
then perform the PR-PCSS for each of the buttocks ( Appendix B ). While viewing the digital 
images of each of their buttocks on a standardized computer monitor and using PR -PCSS for 
buttock, subjects will be instructed to answer the following question for each buttock: Today, 
how would you rate the severity of your cellulite in the area displayed using the PR-PCSS? The subject will be given the following explanations : Ple ase try to match the severity of your 
cellulite, as seen in this digital image, with one of the cellulite levels on the PR -PCSS. Please 
look at the image of your cellulite and the pictures, labels, and descriptions on the PR-PCSS carefully before selecting  your answer. If you feel that your cellulite level is between 2 of the 
levels, please select the level that is closest to your image. If you feel that your cellulite is exactly halfway between two PR- PCSS levels of cellulite severity, please select the more severe 
response. 
The subject will enter their rating electronically into an ePRO system; the Investigator and other 
site personnel will be blinded to the rating entered by the subject. This variable will be entered 
directly into the EDC system, thus the  electronic database will serve as the direct point of data 
capture and will serve as source for this variable.  
13.1.2.2. Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (S -GAIS)  
Subjects will complete the S -GAIS for each of the buttocks as described below at the Day 22, 
Day 43, and Day 71 study visits using the pre- treatment Day 1 digital image (Baseline) of each 
of the buttocks for comparison. 
All treated subjects will be instructed to answer the following question for each buttock:  How would you rate the appearance of your treated cellulite after treatment?  
The S -GAIS assessment will occur after the subject has completed the PR -PCSS assessment to 
avoid introducing potential bias to the static PR- PCSS assessment. The subject will view each of 
their pre -treatment Day 1 d igital images alongside their Day 22, Day 43 or Day 71/End of study 
visit digital images of each of their buttocks to aid in the assessment (Table  5). Subjects will 
provide a rating from those below that best represents their answer for each treated buttock. This variable will be entered directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve 
as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.

13.1.2.3. Subject Satisfaction with Cellulite Treatment Assessment  
At the Day 71 visit, subjects will be instructed to answer a question related to their treated 
buttocks. Subjects will be given a list of responses and they will provide a rating from those 
below that best represents their answer  (Table 6) . 
Today, how satisfied are you with the results of the cellulite treatment you received on the 
specific area or areas on your buttocks that were treated? 
Table 6: Subject Satisfaction with Cellulite Treatment Assessment - Buttocks

+1 I am satisfied with the cellulite treatment on my buttocks.  
0 I am neither dissatisfied nor satisfied with the cellulite treatment on my buttocks.  
-1 I am dissatisfied with the cellulite treatment on my buttocks.  
-2 I am very dissatisfied with the cellulite treatment on my buttocks.  
13.1.2.4. Clinician -Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR -PCSS)  
The CR -PCSS will be conducted for the purpose of assessing the severity of cellulite in the 
buttock. The scale is a 5 -level photonumeric scale developed specifically for clinicians and used 
by the Investigator to assess the severity of the subject’s cellulite in each buttock by live 
assessments; the ratings range from 0 (None) to 4 (Severe) with labels and descriptors to aid the 
Investigator in the assessments.  
Investigators will be trained and qualified on the use of the CR- PCSS p rior to assessing any 
subjects.  
At the Screening visit, the Investigator will determine severity of cellulite of each of the 
two buttocks via live assessment of the subject using the CR-PCSS for buttock ( Appendix C ) 
after the subject has completed her self -assessment using the PR -PCSS. Before injections on 
treatment visits Day  1, Day 22, and Day 43, and on visit Day 71; Investigators will evaluate each 
of the two buttocks by live assessments using the CR-PCSS for the buttock to make his/her 
evaluation. At each visit, the Investigator will make his/her assessment independently and after the subject has conducted her self -assessment using the PR -PCSS.  
This variable will be entered directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic database will serve as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.

   13.1.2.5. Investigator Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (I -GAIS)  
On the Day 22, Day 43, and Day 71 study visits, the Investigator will determine the degree of 
improvement of each buttock by comparing the cellulite from the Day 1 pre- treatment (Baseline) 
digital image of each b uttock to the cellulite seen in a live assessment (Table 7). The I- GAIS 
assessment will occur after the CR -PCSS assessment (section  13.1.2.4) to avoid introducing 
potential bias to the static CR -PCSS assessment by the Investigator. For each buttock, the 
Investigator will provide the rating from those below that best represents his/her answer. 
This variable will be entered directly into the EDC system,  thus the electronic database will serve 
as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.

−1 Worse  The treated area appearance is worse than before treatment  
−2 Much worse  Marked worsening in appearance from the initial condition  
−3 Very much worse  Obvious worsening in appearance from the initial condition  
13.1.2.6. Hexsel Cellulite Severity Scale 
The Hexsel Cellulite Severity Scale (referred to as the Hexsel CSS) is a photonumeric scale that 
looks at 5 key morphologic features of cellulite: (A) number of evident depressions, (B) depth of depressions, (C) morphological appearance of skin surface alterations, (D) laxity, flaccidity or 
sagging of skin, and (E) current classification sc ale based on medical literature including 
Nürnberger and Müller.( 12,13) Each of these features is evaluated on a 4 -point scale from a low 
of 0 to a high of 3 as described in Table 8. The total score is the summation of all 5 features  
(Appendix D ). 
The Investigator or qualified designee will independently use the Hexsel CSS to assess the 
severity of EFP in each of the two buttocks at the Screening visit and each of the two buttocks on Day 1  (Note: In this study, the Hexsel CSS is used exclusively for assessment of su bject 
eligibility; it is not used as an efficacy assessment) . All cellulite assessments should be made 
while the subject is in the standing position with relaxed gluteus muscles. However, when evaluating the subject for Category E (classification scale by Nürnberger and Müller) ( 13) if the 
subject has no evident depressions, the subject should be asked to contract her gluteus muscles or 
the pinch test should be applied (by pinching the skin between the thumb and index finger) so the 
Investigator or qualified designee can differentiate between scores/grades of zero (0) or I. 
This variable will be entered directly into the EDC system, thus the electronic  database will serve 
as the direct point of data capture and will serve as source for this variable.

or with muscle contraction.  
2= second grade = Grade or Stage II = The orange skin or 
mattress appearance is evident when standing, without the use of any manipulation (skin pinching or muscle contraction).  
3= third grade = Grade or Stage III = The alterations described in Grade or Stage II, are present together with raised areas and nodules.  
a Subjects should be evaluated  in the standing position with relaxed gluteus muscles. However, if the subject has no 
evident depressions, they should be asked to contract their gluteus muscles or the pinch test should be applied (by pinching the skin between the thumb and index finger)  in order to differentiate between grade/stage of zero (0)  
or I.

   14. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
14.1. Definitions 
14.1.1. Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable or unintended change in body structure (signs), body 
function (symptoms), laboratory result (eg, chemistry, ECG, X- ray, etc), or worsening of a 
pre-existing condition associated temporally with the use of the study medication whether or not 
considered related to the study medication. Adverse events will be captured once a subject has signed the informed consent. AEs include: 
• Changes in the general condition of the subject 
• Subjective symptoms offered by or elicited from the subject 
• Objective signs observed by the Investigator or other study personnel 
• All concurrent diseases that occur after the start of the study, including any change in 
severity or frequency of pre- existing disease  
• All clinically relevant laboratory  abnormalities or physical findings that occur during 
the study 
A treatment -emergent adverse event  (TEAE) is any condition that was not present prior to 
treatment with study medication but appeared following treatment, was present at treatment 
initiation b ut worsened during treatment, or was present at treatment initiation but resolved and 
then reappeared while the individual was on treatment (regardless of the intensity of the AE 
when the treatment was initiated).  
All AEs, including both observed or volunteered problems, complaints, signs or symptoms must 
be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF, regardless of whether associated with the use of study 
medication. This would include AEs resulting from concurrent illness, reactions to concurrent 
medication use, or progression of disease states (excluding the disease under study). A condition present at baseline that worsens after initiation of study treatment will be captured as an AE; the 
onset date will be the date the event worsened. The AE should be recorded in standard medical 
terminology when possible. 
14.1.2. Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an AE that:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening (there is an immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred; this does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more serious form may 
have caused death) 
• Results in or prolongs an inpatient hospitalization (Note: a hospitalization for elective or pre -planned surgery, procedure, or drug therapy does not constitute an SAE) 

EN3835-302 Protocol 
14-Sep-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 49 
   • Results in permanent or substantial disability (permanent or substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to  conduct normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in offspring of a subject using the study medication regardless of time to diagnosis)  
• Is co nsidered an important medical event 
Important medical events are defined as events that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes. Exam ples of important medical events include malignancy, allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug ab use. 
14.2. Monitoring Adverse Events  
At each visit, subjects will be queried regarding any AEs that have occurred since the last visit. 
Subjects will be asked to volunteer information concerning AEs with a non-leading question 
such as, “How do you fee l?” Study site personnel will then record all pertinent information in the 
source documents and the eCRF. The study drug compliance record should also be reviewed to 
detect potential overdoses (intentional/unintentional). 
14.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
The deg ree of “relatedness” of the AE to the study medication must be descr ibed using the 
following scale:  
• Not related  indicates that the AE is definitely not related to the study medication.  
• Unlikely related  indicates that there are other, more likely causes and  study 
medication is not suspected as a cause.  
• Possibly related indicates that a direct cause and effect relationship between study 
medication and the AE has not been demonstrated, but there is evidence to suggest 
there is a reasonable possibility that the event was caused by the study medication.  
• Probably related  indicates that there is evidence suggesting a direct cause and effect 
relationship between the AE and the study medication. 
It is the Sponsor’s policy to consider “Probably related” and “Possibly related” causality assessments as positive causality. “Not related” and “Unlikely related” causality assessments are 
considered as negative causality.  
Assessments will be recorded on the eCRF and must indicate clearly the relationship being 
assessed. For example, an AE that appears during a placebo run-in phase would be assessed with 
respect to the placebo treatment received and/or study procedures conducted during this phase. If 
the AE continued into an active treatment phase, the relationship would be as sessed for the active 
treatment phase only if the AE worsened.

   14.4. Intensity Assessment  
The intensity (or severity) of AEs is characterized as mild, moderate, or severe:  
• Mild  AEs are usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and do not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate AEs introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and 
may interfere with daily activities, but are usually ameliorated by simple therapeutic measures.  
• Severe AEs interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and typically require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. 
When the intensity category of an AE changes, the greatest intensity during that continuous 
episode should be recorded. 
14.5. Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
14.5.1. Reporting Adverse Events  
Throughout the study, AEs will be documented on the source document and on the appropriate page of the eCRF whether or not considered treatment-related. This includes any new signs, symptoms, injury or illness, including increased severity of previously existing signs, symptoms, 
injury, or illness. Conditions existing prior to screening will be recorded as part of the subject’s 
medical history. The Investigator is responsible for assessing the relationship of AEs to the study medication; rela tionship will be classified as not related, unlikely related, possibl y related, or 
probably related.  
All AEs will be collected by the Investigator from the time of signing the informed consent through 28 days after the last dose of study medication; this i ncludes any AEs that are ongoing at 
the time of completion/termination of the study. All ongoing AEs must be followed until resolution or for 30 days after the subject’s last study visit, whichever comes first. 
14.5.2. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Any SAE, inc luding death resulting from any cause, which occurs to any subject participating in 
this study must be reported via email or fax by the Investigator using the Endo Clinical Trial 
Report Form for SAEs within 24 hours of first becoming aware of the SAE. SAEs will be collected by the Investigator from the time of signing the informed consent through 28 days after 
the last dose of study medication. SAEs that occur within 28 days, following cessation of the 
study treatment, or within 30 days, following premature discontinuation from the study for any reason, must also be reported within the same timeframe. Any SAE that is felt by the Investigator 
to be related to the study medication must be reported regardless of the amount of time since the 
last dose received. Follow -up information collected for any initial report of an SAE must also be 
reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of receipt by the Investigator. 
All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization of condition, or until follow-up is no 
longer possible.  

EN3835-302 Protocol 
14-Sep-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 51 
   In the event discussion is necessary regarding treatment of a subject, call the Medical 
Monitor (see contact information in section  3). 
All S AEs should be sent via the email address, or faxed to the fax number, provided in 
section  3. 
The Sponsor will determine whether the SAE must be reported within 7 or 15 days to regulatory 
authorities in compliance with local and regional law. If so, the Sponsor (or the Sponsor’s 
representative) will report the event to the appropriate regulatory authorities. The Investigator will report SAEs to the IRB per their IRB policy. 
14.5.2.1. Follow-u p Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
To fully understand the nature of any SAE, obtaining follow- up information is important. 
Whenever possible, relevant medical records such as discharge summaries, medical 
consultations, and the like should be obtained. In the event of death, regardless of cause, all 
attempts should be made to obtain the death certificate and any autopsy report. These records 
should be reviewed in detail, and the Investigator should comment on any event, l ab 
abnormality, or any other finding, noting whether it should be considered a serious or 
non-serious AE, or whether it should be considered as part of the subject’s history. In addition, 
all events or other findings determined to be SAEs should be identified on the follow-up SAE form and the Investigator should consider whether the event is related or not related to study 
drug. 
14.6. Special Reporting Situations  
14.6.1. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events such as bruising, ecchymosis, hematomas, and contusions that occur remote to 
the site of drug administration, or any  hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, will be 
recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate (see s ection  14.1.1, Adverse Events or s ection  14.1.2, 
Serious Adverse Events). 
14.6.2. Overdose/Misuse/Abuse 
14.6.2.1. Overdose  
Study drug overdose is any accidental or intentional use of study drug in an amount higher than 
the dose indicated by the protocol for that subject. Study drug compliance (see section 12.9) 
should be reviewed to detect potential instances of overdose (intentional or accidental). 
Any study drug overdose during the study should be noted on the study medication eCRF. 
An overdose is not an AE per se, however all AEs associat ed with an overdose should both be 
entered on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported using the procedures detailed in section 14.5.2, 
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events, even if the events do not meet seriousness criteria. If the 
AE associated with an overdose does not meet seriousness criteria, it must still be reported using 
the Endo Clinical Trial Report Form for SAEs and in an expedited manner, but should be noted as non-serious on the form and the Adverse Event eCRF. 

EN3835-302 Protocol 
14-Sep-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 52 
   14.6.3. Pregnancy  
Subjects should be instructed to immediately notify the Investigator of any pregnancies.  
Any pregnancy that occurs in a subject during this clinical study will be reported  for tracking 
purposes only . All subject pregnancies that are identified during or after this study, where the 
estimated date of conception is determined to have occurred during study drug therapy or within 
28 days of the last dose of study medication need to be reported, followed to conclusion, and the 
outcome reported, even if the subject is discontinued from the study. The Investigator  should 
report all pregnancies within 24 hours using the Initial Pregnancy Report Form, and any 
pregnancy- associated SAE using the SAE report form, according to the usual timelines and 
directions for SAE reporting provided in section 14.5.2. Monitoring of the pregnancy should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy; 1 or more Follow-up Pregnancy Report Form(s) detailing progress, and a Two Month Follow-up Pregnancy Report Form detailing the outcome, 
should be submitted. 
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that the investigational 
product under study may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. 
Likewise, elective abortions without complications are not considered AEs. Any SAEs 
associated with pregnancy (eg, co ngenital abnormalities/birth defects/spontaneous miscarriages 
or any other serious events) must additionally be reported as such using the SAE report form. 
Spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported and handled as SAEs. 
A subject who becomes pregnant must be withdrawn from the study . Attempts to obtain the 
pregnancy follow -up and pregnancy outcome information detailed above are necessary even if a 
subject discontinues treatment because of pregnancy.  
14.6.4. AEs/SAEs Experienced by Non -subjects Exposed to Study Medication  
Non-subjects are persons who are not enrolled in the study but have been exposed to study 
medication, including instances of diversion of study medication. All such AEs/SAEs occurring 
in non-subjects from such exposure will be reported to the Endo PVRM Department (when the 
non-subject agrees) on the departmental form for serious adverse experiences regardless of 
whether the event is serious or not. Instructions for completing the form for events experienced 
by non-subjects will be provided. SAEs occurring in non-subjects exposed to study medication 
will be processed within the same SAE reporting timelines as described in section  14.5.2, 
Reporting Serious Adverse Events. Additionally, the drug accountability source documentation 
at the site should reflect this occurrence.  
14.7. Clinical Laboratory Determinations  
Clinical laboratory tests will be conducted according to the Schedule of Events (section 5). Clinical laboratory tests will be performed by a designated central laboratory . Each site will be 
provided with instructions on specimen collection, preparation, packaging and transport. Re fer to 
the central laboratory manual for further information regarding sample collection, handling, and labeling. The results of the tests will be returned to the investigational sites.  

EN3835-302 Protocol 
14-Sep-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 53 
   Clinical laboratory test data will be reviewed by the Investigator, or designee, and additional 
clinical laboratory tests may be ordered at his/her discretion (eg, if the results of any clinical 
laboratory test falls outside the reference range or clinical symptoms necessitate additional 
testing to ensure safety). Any addit ional testing will be performed by the designated central 
laboratory. The Investigator or qualified designee must acknowledge the review of laboratory 
results.  
The Investigator will review all abnormal lab results for potentially clinically important. Any 
abnormal clinical laboratory test result meeting the Investigator ’s criteria for potentially 
clinically important (refer to central laboratory manual) will be recorded as an AE or SAE as 
appropriate (see section 14.1.1, Adverse Events, and section 14.1.2, Serious Adverse Events). 
Laboratory resu lts will be sent electronically to Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. for data management.  
Clinical laboratory parameters that will be measured in this study are listed in Table 9.

Day 22, and Day 43 (refer to s ection  5). Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a 
negative pregnancy test at the Screening Visit and at Day 1 (Baseline), Day 22, and Day 43 to be 
randomized and/or receive treatment in the study. If necessary, additional urine pregnancy tests 
can be performed at any time during the study at the discretion of the Investigator. Urine pregnancy test kits will be supplied by the Sponsor. 

EN3835-302 Protocol 
14-Sep-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 55 
   14.11.  Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination will be performed at the Screening Visit. All examinations will 
be performed by a physician or health professional listed on the Form FDA 1572 and licensed to 
perform physical examinations. Height and body weight will be meas ured and recorded at 
screening.  
The Investigator will review all physical exam findings for clinical significance. Any physical 
exam finding meeting the Investigator ’s or Sponsor’s criteria for clinical significance will be 
recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate (see section  14.1.1, Adverse Events and section  14.1.2, 
Serious Adverse Events ). 
At screening, the Investigator will also assess the subject’s skin type using the Fitzpatrick scale 
(Table 11). Only the Fitzpatrick Scale shown below may be used during the study.  
Table 11: Fitzpatrick Scale  
I Pale white skin, blue/hazel eyes, blond/red hair  Always burns, does not tan 
II Fair skin, blue eyes  Burns easily, tans poorly 
III Darker white skin  Tans after initial burn  
IV Light brown skin  Burns minimally, tans easily  
V Brown skin  Rarely burns, tans darkly easily  
VI Dark brown or black skin  Never burns, always tans darkly  
Follow-up body weight will be measured before injection on Day 22 and Day 43 and at the 
Day 71 visit.

   17.2.2. Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT population is defined as all randomized subjects who have received at least one 
injection of study medication. All demographic and baseline characteristic summaries will be 
based on this population. The primary and key secondary efficacy parameters will be 
summa rized based on this population. 
17.2.3. Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population 
The mITT population is defined as all intent- to-treat subjects with a baseline and at least 1  
post-injection evaluation of both the Investigator CR-PCSS and subject PR- PCSS for both left 
and right buttocks. All secondary and supportive efficacy evaluations will be based on the mITT population. 
17.2.4. Per-Protocol (PP) Population 
The per -protocol population is defined as the mITT subjects without any major protocol 
deviation that will impact the subject’s efficacy and safety. This population may be used in the 
efficacy sensitivity analysis.  
17.3. Subject Disposition  
The number of subjects included in each study population will be summarized by treatment group. Subjects excluded from the safety and efficacy (eg, ITT) populations will be listed by treatment group.  
The number and percentage of subjects completed and prematurely discontinued during the treatment peri od will be presented for each treatment group and pooled across treatment groups. 
Screen failures (ie, screened but not randomized subjects) and the associated failure reasons will 
be tabulated overall. Reasons for premature discontinuation from the treatment period as 
recorded on the termination page of the eCRF will be summarized (number and percentage) by treatment group for all randomized subjects. Percentage of premature discontinuations will be 
compared between treatment groups.  
17.4. Demographics and Other  Baseline Characteristics  
The summarization of demographic variables (eg, age, sex, race, weight, height, and body mass 
index [ BMI]), medical and surgical history, and other baseline characteristics relevant to the 
indication studied in the study will be d escribed.  
Demographic characteristics, including sex, age, age group, race, height, and weight, will be summarized by treatment group, for the ITT population, using descriptive statistics. All screening characteristics and medical information will also be summarized by treatment group 
using descriptive statistics. The descriptive summaries will include frequency tables for all 
categorical response variables and n, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum for all continuous variables.  

EN3835-302 Protocol 
14-Sep-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 60 
   17.5. Effic acy Analyses  
All efficacy endpoints including supportive efficacy analysis will be summarized as percentages. 
The dichotomous secondary endpoints (ie, responder endpoints) will be analyzed using a 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted for Investigator . Changes in the PR-PCSS ratings and 
CR-PCSS ratings from baselines, S -GAIS scores, and I -GAIS scores will be analyzed using the 
Wilcoxon rank sum test. All the tests are two -sided. 
The primary endpoint will be summarized as percentages and analyzed using a Coc hran-Mantel -
Haenszel test that compares the 2 treatment groups and adjusts for Investigator at a level of 
significance of 0.05 based on the ITT population. Any subject who does not have an evaluation 
of CR -PCSS and/or PR- PCSS at Day 71 will be classified a s a non-responder. 
The key secondary efficacy analyses will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary 
endpoint based on the ITT population. Any subject who does not have an evaluation at Day 71 
will be classified as a non -responder for the analyses. Th e family #1 key secondary efficacy 
analyses will be performed only if the primary efficacy analysis is significant ( p ≤ 0.05; 
gatekeeping strategy). Similarly family #2 key secondary efficacy analyses will be performed only if at least one of the key secondary efficacy endpoints of family #1 is significant ( p ≤ 0.025; 
parallel gatekeeping strategy). Within a family of ke y secondary efficacy endpoints, Bonferroni’ s 
method will be performed to relocate unused alpha for testing each endpoint to assure an overall error rate of p ≤ 0.05. The details of the testing procedures will be provided in the statistical 
analysis plan fo r the study. 
All supportive endpoints will be summarized as percentages. All the supportive analyses will be 
performed based on all observed data (ie, missing data not imputed) in the mITT population at 
all visits without multiplicity adjustment. This analysis will also be performed at Day 71 with missing data at Day 71 imputed by a last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach if 
subjects have at least one post-dose assessment. The dichotomous secondary endpoints (ie, 
responder endpoints) will be analyzed using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted for 
Investigator. Changes in the PR- PCSS ratings and CR -PCSS ratings from baselines, S -GAIS 
scores, and I- GAIS scores will be analyzed us ing the Wilcoxon rank sum test. 
17.5.1. Primary Efficacy Variable 
The primary efficacy variable is the proportion of 2-level composite responders at Day 71 defined as subjects with at least one of two treated buttocks with: 
• an improvement in severity from baseline (Day 1 visit) of at least 2 levels of severity in the CR- PCSS as asse ssed live by the Investigator, and   
• an improvement in severity from baseline of at least 2  levels of severity in the 
PR-PCSS by the subject while viewing the digital image of the same buttock. 
A subject will be considered a responder if these criteria are met in either the left buttock or right buttock or both buttocks in that subject. In other words, a subject will be considered a responder 
if she has an improvement of at least 2 levels  on the PR-PCSS and an improvement of at least 
2 levels  on the CR- PCSS on that same buttock; that buttock could be the left buttock or right 
buttock or both buttocks. 

EN3835-302 Protocol 
14-Sep-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 61 
   Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint will include: 
• ITT subjects with missing data handled by multiple imputation (MI) approach 
• ITT subjects with missin g data handled by an LOCF approach 
• mITT subjects with missing data handled by an LOCF approach  
• Observed data only (no missing data handling) 
• Per-protocol (PP) subjects with missing data handled by an LOCF approach if 10% or 
more subjects are excluded in the PP population from mITT population

The World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary will be used to classify prior and concomitant medi cations by therapeutic class. Prior medication will be defined as any 
medication taken prior to the first dose of study drug. Concomitant medication is defined as any 
medication taken on or after the da te of first dose of study drug.  
Prior and concomitant medication use will be summarized descriptively by the number and percentage of subjects for each preferred term (generic name from WHO dictionary) by treatment. Multiple use of the same medication by a subject will be counted only once. 

EN3835-302 Protocol 
14-Sep-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 65 
   17.6.2. Study Drug Exposur e 
The following information regarding treatment will be summarized per each treated buttock by 
treatment group:  
• Total number of treatment visits  
• Number of subjects who had treatment session done or treatment session not done at each treatment visit  
• For subjects who had the treatment session done, the number of subjects who got all 
24 injections at the treatment visit or who received less than 24 injections 
• Number of injections given at each treatment visit  
• Number of dimples treated at each treatment visit  
• Average number of injections per dimple at each treatment visit  
Subjects who did not receive all 3 treatment visits and who did not receive 24 injections at a treatment visit will be listed.  
17.6.3. Measurement of Treatment Compliance  
Not applicable (the study drug is administered at the site by the study investigator).  
17.6.4. Adverse Events  
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be used to code AEs.  
An AE (classified by preferred term) that started on or after the date of the first dos e of the study 
drug will be considered a TEAE if it was not present prior to the first dose of study drug, or was 
present prior to the first dose of study drug but increased in intensity during the treatment period. 
If more than 1 AE is reported prior to the first dose of study drug and coded to the same 
preferred term, then the AE with the greatest intensity will be used as the benchmark for comparison to the AEs occurring during the treatment period which were also coded to that 
preferred term. Any AE pre sent prior to the first dose of study drug that increases in intensity 
during the treatment period will be re -entered with a new start date of the date of increased 
intensity.  
Descriptive statistics (the number and percentage) for subjects reporting TEAEs in each 
treatment group will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term; by system organ class, preferred term, and severity; and by system organ class, preferred term, and relationship to 
study drug. If more than 1 AE is coded to the same prefe rred term for the same subject, the 
subject will be counted only once for that preferred term using the most severe and most related 
occurrence for the summarization by severity and by relationship to the study drug. 
The by -frequency summaries will also in clude incidence of the SAEs and non- SAEs by preferred 
term that at least 2% of the subjects in one treatment group. Duration of AEs will be tabulated by 
treatment group.  
Fisher’s Exact test will be use d to compare EN3835 to placebo. 

EN3835-302 Protocol 
14-Sep-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 66 
   Listings will be presen ted for subjects with SAEs, subjects with AEs leading to discontinuation 
of study or study drug, and subjects who die (if any). 
17.6.5. Vital Signs  
Descriptive statistics for vital signs (eg, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and 
body weight) and their changes from baseline at each visit and at the end of study will b e 
presented by treatment group. 
Vital sign values are potentially clinically important (PCI) if they meet both the observed value 
criteria and the change from baseline criteria. The cr iteria for PCI vital sign values will be 
detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The PCI percentages will be calculated relative to 
the number of subjects with baseline and at least one post- baseline assessment. A supportive 
listing of subject values will be provided including the subject ID, study center, treatment group, 
baseline and post- baseline values.  
The change from baseline for vital signs parameters are compared between EN3835 and placebo using an analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with a fa ctor of drug (EN3835 or placebo) while 
Fisher’s exact test will be used for the incidence of PCI values.  
17.6.6. Clinical Laboratory Parameters  
Descriptive statistics for clinical laboratory values in International System of Units (SI units) and changes from basel ine at Day 71 will be presented by treatment group for each clinical 
laboratory parameter.  
The number and percentage of subjects with potentially clinically important (PCI) post- baseline 
clinical laboratory values will be tabulated by treatment group. The criteria for PCI laboratory values will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The PCI percentages will be 
calculated relative to the number of subjects with at least one post -baseline assessment. A 
supportive listing of subjects with post- baseline PCI values will be provided, including the 
subject ID, study center, treatment group, baseline and post- baseline values.  
The change from baseline for clinical laboratory parameters are compared between EN3835 and 
placebo using an ANOVA with a factor of drug (EN3835 or placebo) while Fisher’s exact test will be used for the incidence of PCI values.  
17.6.7. Electrocardiogram  
Not applicable (ECG is done only at screening for the subject’s enrollment eligibility) . 
17.6.8. Physical Examination 
Body weight and BMI at Day 22, Day 43, and Day 71 as well as their change from baseline 
(Day  1) at those time points will be presented by treatment group . 
17.6.9. Other Safety Measurements  
Not applicable.

   22. DATA HANDLING AND RE CORDKEEPING  
22.1. Data Collection  
Endo will provide an electronic data capture (EDC) system for this study. Data collection will 
involve the use of an EDC system to which only authorized personnel will have access. The system will be secured to prevent unauthorized access to the data or the sy stem. This will include 
the requirement for a user ID and password to enter or change data. The level of access to the EDC system will be dependent on the person’s role in the study. 
Study data will be collected from source documents and entered into an eC RF within the EDC 
system. The Investigator will be responsible for ensuring the eCRFs are completed in a timely 
manner relative to the subject’s visit. In addition to periodic monitoring occurring within the system by a Sponsor monitor, programmatic edit checks will be used to review EDC data for 
completeness, logic, and adherence to the study protocol. As a result of this monitoring and these 
checks, queries may be issued electronically to the clinical study sites and closed electronically by the monitor, data management staff or authorized staff at the study site. Additionally, the 
Investigator will review eCRFs, ensure all missing or corrected data is provided and will sign the 
eCRF page s with an electronic signature.  
An electronic audit trail will be maintained in the EDC system to track all changes made to data 
entered in the eCRF. Data will be retrievable in such a fashion that all information regarding 
each individual subject is attributable to that subject. Unless otherwise indicated, all data captured in the eCRF must first be captured in source documents. Data that can be directly 
recorded in the eCRF will be clearly identified in the section(s) of the protocol that describes the 
assessment(s).  
Data entries will be corrected by changing the entry in the EDC system. Any changes or 
corrections to eCRF data will be electronically tracked and will include the reason for correction, 
who made the correction and the date/time stamp when the correction was made within the audit trail of the EDC system.  
In addition, any contact with the subject via telephone or other means that provide significant clinical information must be documented in source documents as described above. 
22.2. Study Documentation  
Upon study completion, the Investigator will be provided with complete electronic copies of the 
case report form (CRF)  data for his/her files .

   1. STUDY OBJECTIVE 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of EN3835 in the 
treatment of edematous fibrosclerotic panniculopathy (EFP) commonly known as cellulite in 
adult women. 
2. STUDY DESIGN AND MEASURES  
This study is a Phase  3 randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and 
safety of EN3835 in the treatment of EFP in adult women. Subjects will be screened for study 
eligibility within 14  days prior to enrolling in this study. Subjects with 2 treatment areas 
(bilateral buttocks) (also referred to as quadrants) with moderate or severe levels of cellulite as independently assessed by the subject using the Patient Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (PR -PCSS) and by the investigator using the Clinician
 Reported Photonumeric 
Cellulite Severity Scale (CR -PCSS).  
Once the eligibility of the buttocks  is confirmed again on Day 1, subjects will be randomly 
assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups, EN3835 1.68 mg total dose (0.84 mg per buttock) or 
placebo, in a 1:1 ratio within an investigational site. A treatment course will consist of 
3 treatment sessions (ie, Days  1, 22, and 43). Each treatment session will consist of 12 injections 
(0.3 mL per injection of EN3835 0.07 mg/injection or placebo) in each of the buttocks for a total 
volume of 7.2 mL. Selection of dimples to be treated in each buttock will be at the discretion of 
the investigator. End of study will occur at study Day 71. Of the two assigned eligible buttocks, one buttock will be randomly selected as the target buttock on Day 1 for the primary efficacy 
endpoint. The other (remaining) buttock will be considered the non-target buttock. Subjects, 
investigators, site personnel, and Endo personnel will be blinded to the identification of the target and non-target buttocks. 
At each treatment session, each of the buttocks will be photographed before and a fter marking 
dimples and injection sites while the subject is in a consistent, standardized relaxed standing 
pose. The subject will assess the digital photographic image (pre- marking) of each of the 
buttocks using the PR- PCSS to determine the severity of E FP in each of the buttocks. The 
subject will also evaluate each of the buttocks using a Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (S -GAIS). Subsequently, the investigator will conduct live assessments of each of the 
buttocks using the CR- PCSS. At Day  1, the subject will complete a Patient Reported Cellulite 
Impact Scale (PR -CIS) assessment and a Subject Self -rating Scale (SSRS) assessment. The 
subject assessments will always be completed prior to and independently of the investigator 
assessments at each t reatment visit. The investigator will assess each of the buttocks using an 
Investigator Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (I -GAIS). All the assessments must be done 
before the dimple marking.  
At Day  71 (End of Study/Early Termination), photographs of each of the buttocks will be taken 
and evaluated by the subject using the PR- PCSS. The investigator will conduct live assessments 
of each of the buttocks using the CR- PCSS. Global assessment evaluations will be completed by 
both the subject and the investigator.  
Table 1 contains the schedule of assessments.

14. Any other condition(s) that, in the Investigator’s opinion, might indicate the subject to be 
unsuitable for the study 
2.3. Selection of Ta rget Buttock  
Upon confirmation of the two buttocks that are eligible for treatment (eligible criteria being each 
buttock have PR- PCSS and CR -PCSS scores of 3 or 4) on Day 1 prior to treatment 
randomization, the IWRS system will randomly assign one buttock as the target buttock in the 
background. The other (remaining) buttock will be considered the non-target buttock. The target 
buttock will be used for the primary efficacy endpoint. Subjects, investigators, site personnel and 
Endo personnel will be blinded to the target buttock assignment and will remain blinded until the clinical study database has been cleaned and locked.  
2.4. Selection of Dimples and Injection Sites During Treatment Visits  
2.4.1. Selecting and Marking the Dimples  
Selection of dimples to be treated in  the two buttocks is at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Dimples must be well-defined and evident when the subject is standing in a consistent relaxed pose (without the use of any manipulation such as skin pinching or muscle contraction). Each subject will receive 3  treatment sessions of study drug in three visits, ie, Day 1, Day  22, and 
Day 43, according to randomization unless the buttock is dimple-free (score of 0 on CR- PCSS as 
reported by the Investigator); a dimple-free buttock does not preclude tre atment of the 
contralateral buttock unless it is dimple -free also. During each treatment session, each of the 
buttocks will be photographed before and after marking dimples and injection sites while the subject is standing in a consistent relaxed pose as described in the Photography Manual. The cellulite severity assessments using the PR -PCSS and CR -PCSS will be completed prior to 
marking dimples and injection sites.  
The Investigator or qualified designee will select dimples within each buttock that are well-defined, evident when the subject is standing, and suitable for treatment; treatment consists 
of 12 injections per buttock (24 injections total in two buttocks) per session. Because the goal of treatment is to improve the aesthetic appearance of each entire buttock, the Investigator will be 
instructed to select dimples that in his or her opinion would most improve the aesthetic 
appearance of each entire buttock. The same dimples within a buttock or different dimples within 
a buttock may be treated at each session but injections must all be within the buttocks (12 injections per buttock) for all 3 sessions. Each buttock will receive all 3 treatment sessions 
unless the buttock has no treatable EFP dimples and the Investigator rates the buttock a score of 0 on the CR-PCSS. If no injections in a particular buttock (right or left) are given at Treatment Session  2, subjects will still be assessed for treatment in the contralateral buttock at Treatment 
Session  2, and will return for the Day 43 visit and each of the buttocks will again be evaluated by 
the subject (PR -PCSS) and Investigator (CR-PCSS). If the Investigator rates either or both of the 
buttocks greater than 0 on the CR- PCSS, injections at Treatment Session  3 should be given. 

Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Module  1 – Study EN3835-302 
30-Aug-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 16 
   2.4.2. Selecting Injection Sites  
For each dimple selected for treatment, the Investigator or qualified designee will choose 
injection sites (injection sites within a dimple should be spaced approximately 2  cm apart, if a 
dimple requires more than 1 injection; locating at least one injection site at the nadir, if present, of the dimple). Each injection site will be marked with a “dot” using a surgical marker. For round dimples, the “dot” will be placed in the center of the dimple; for elongated dimples, “dots” 
will be spaced out approximate ly 2 cm along the longer axis of the dimple. The Investigator or 
qualified designee will then use a surgical marker to circle each of the dimples selected for 
treatment. Circles in the buttock should not overlap.  
2.5. Randomization and Study Drug Administration  
2.5.1. Randomization 
If the 2  buttocks continue to meet eligibility criteria at Day  1, the subject will be eligible for 
randomization to study medication. Subjects will be randomized to EN3835 1.68 mg total dose (0.84 mg per buttock) or placebo in a 1:1  ratio. There will be approximately 210  subjects 
assigned to the EN3835 treatment group and 210 subjects assigned to the placebo group. Randomization of assigned treatment will be stratified by site using the interactive web response system (IWRS).  
2.5.2. Blinding and Unblinding  
This will be a double-blind study in which the investigator, study subject, and other study 
personnel involved in the evaluation of the subject efficacy and safety are blinded to the study drug treatment. The data vendor personnel in charge of the IWRS and the Endo personnel in 
charge of drug supply will be unblinded to study drug assignment, but will have no interaction 
with the subjects, investigators, clinical personnel, or study data.  
Unblinding of study treatment assignments will occur after all subjects have completed the study 
and the clinical study database has been cleaned and locked. Unblinding will occur by matching 
the kit numbers reported in the electronic case report form (eCRF) to the master list of kits in the IWRS. An y mistreatments will be reported as major protocol violations. In the case of a medical 
emergency, sites have the ability to determine treatment identification. If this occurs, the medical monitor will be notified immediately.  
2.5.3. Study Drug Administration 
At each treatment session, the site will request study drug kit numbers from the IWRS used for 
injections. For each of the two buttocks, the site personnel in charge of drug preparation will then 
reconstitute the study medication and prepare 4 syringes for st udy drug administration per 
buttock. The kit number, the number of injections given, and the number of dimples treated for 
each buttock will be recorded in the eCRF. The investigator will also indicate whether the 
subject received the injections per buttock as described in the protocol. If less than 12 injections are given for any buttock at any treatment session, the investigator is to indicate on the eCRF the 
number of injections and state the reason why fewer than 12 injections were given for that 
buttock.

30-Aug-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 17 
   2.6. Digital Photographs  
The investigator or qualified designee will photograph each buttock using a Sponsor-supplied 
standardized digital camera (Vectra, Canfield Scientific, Inc .) in a standardized manner. The 
subject will be standing for each photography session and will be wearing a standardized photographic garment as described in the Photography Manual. Each buttock will be photographed while the subject is standing in a consistent, relaxed standing pose, ie standing 
position with relaxed gluteus muscles, at the following time points: 
• Screening (no markings of dimples or injection site) - each of the two buttocks  
• Before and after marking dimples and injection sites (prior to injections) on Day 1, Day 22, and Day  43 - each of the two buttocks 
• During the Day  71 visit (end of study/early termination) (no dimple or injection site 
markings) - each of the two buttocks 
2.7. Patient  Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (PR -PCSS)  
Subjects will rate the severity of their cellulite of each of their two buttock s at Screening and on 
Day 1, Day 22, Day 43, and Day 71 using the PR- PCSS. The PR -PCSS is a photonumeric scale 
ranging from 0 to 4. The following labels and descriptions are associated with each level of 
severity on the PR- PCSS:  
0: None: No evident cellul ite 
1: Almost None: A few superficial dimples or ridges  
2: Mild: Several dimples or ridges of which most are superficial  
3: Moderate: Many dimples or ridges of which most are somewhat deep  
4: Severe: A lot of dimples or ridges of which many are deep covering most of the skin 
area 
Subjects will be instructed to sequentially look at each buttock under evaluation on a 
standardized 22” computer monitor and decide which of the images, labels, and descriptions on 
the PR -PCSS (mounted on a 10”×18” foam board) best match the severity of the cellulite in the 
scale. Subjects will be instructed that rating responses must be given in whole numbers; no half 
numbers are allowed. Subjects will be instructed to choose a PR- PCSS rating that is closest to 
their cellulite seve rity in the buttock being evaluated. Subjects will be instructed that if they 
consider the severity of the cellulite in the buttock is exactly halfway between 2  levels, to choose 
the more severe level. Subjects will enter their responses directly into an electronic data capture 
(EDC) system using a handheld tablet; the investigator and site personnel will be blinded to the rating entered by the subject. Each subject will have their own username and password to gain 
entry into the EDC system. The investigato r and the investigator’s personnel will not have access 
to subject’s password. Once subjects have completed their evaluations for the visit, they will log 
out from the EDC system.

30-Aug-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 18 
   2.8. Clinician  Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale 
(CR-PCSS)  
Investiga tors will rate the severity of the cellulite of each of the two buttocks at Screening and on 
Day 1, Day 22, Day 43, and Day 71 using the CR- PCSS. The CR -PCSS mirrors the PR -PCSS in 
every manner except the descriptions.  
The following labels and descriptions are associated with each level of severity on the CR -PCSS 
Buttock scale:  
0: None: No dimples or evident cellulite 1: Almost None: Few dimples that are mostly superficial in depth  
2: Mild: Several dimples of which most are shallow in depth 
3: Moderate: Many dimples of which most are moderate in depth 
4: Severe: A lot of dimples with some of more severe depth 
Investigators will be instructed to look at each buttock under evaluation ‘live’ with the subject 
standing in front of him/her. The investigator is to decide which of the images, labels  and 
descriptions on the CR-PCSS (mounted on a 10”×18” foam board) best match the severity of the cellulite in the buttock. Investigators will be trained that responses must be given in whole numbers; no half numbers are allowed. Investigators will be trained that if they observe the 
cellulite in the buttock is exactly halfway between 2  levels, to choose the more severe level. 
Investigators will enter their responses directly into an EDC system using a handheld tablet. 
They will enter their username and password to gain access to the EDC system; the subject will 
not have access to view the investigator ratings. Investigators will be instructed not to verbalize their rating(s) or any opinion of the subject’s cellulite severity in order not to influence the subject. At each visit, the Investigator will make his/her assessment using the CR -PCSS 
independently and after the subject has conducted her self- assessment using the PR -PCSS 
Investigators will go through a training proc ess and will need to pass a qualifying exercise prior 
to using the CR- PCSS.  
2.9. Patient  Reported Cellulite Impact Scale (PR -CIS)  
The Patient  Reported Cellulite Impact Scale is a 6 -item static questionnaire; each item is 
answered by a subject on an 11-level numerical rating scale from 0 (equating to no impact but with wording specifically based on the question) to 10 (equating to extreme impact but with 
wording specifically based on the question) while viewing digital images of their buttocks at that 
visit. The PR -CIS items and their response options are listed below:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
Subjects will be asked to answer the PR -CIS at Day  1 and Day 71 after they rate their cellulite 
severity on buttocks. Subjects will enter their responses to each of the 6 items directly into an 
EDC system using a handheld tablet.   
2.10. Subject Self -rating Scale (SSRS)  
The SSRS is a measure that assesses  subject satisfaction with appearance in association with 
cellulite on the buttocks using whole numbers on a 7- level scale that ranges from 0  (extremely 
dissatisfied) to 6  (extremely satisfied). The patient will be asked to respond to the question 
related to the satisfaction with appearance of the cellulite on their buttocks on Day 1 and Day 71. 
No photographs or reference to previous ratings or evaluations will be used. Subjects will be given a list of responses and they will provide a rating from those be low that best represents their 
answer ( Table 2).  
Subjects will enter their responses directly into an EDC system  using a handheld tablet.

2.11. Global Assessment Ratings  
2.11.1. Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (S -GAIS)  
Subjects will complete the S -GAIS for each of the buttocks on Day 22, Day  43, and Day  71 
using the pre- treatment Day  1 image (Baseline) of the same buttock for comparison. Subjec ts 
will be asked to determine the degree of change seen in each buttock compared with how it 
looked before treatment on the following scale ( Table 3). The subject will conduct the S- GAIS 
assessment after she completes her PR -CSS assessment to avoid introducing potential bias to the 
static PR -PCSS assessment.  
Table 3: Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (S -GAIS)  
Rating  Response Option  Description  
+3 Very much improved  My treated cellulite looks very much better.  
+2 Much improved  My treated cellulite looks much better, but additional treatment would 
slightly improve the result.  
+1 Improved  My treated cellulite looks better, but additional treatment is necessary.  
0 No change  My treated cellulite looks essentially the same as it did originally.  
−1 Worse  My treated cellulite looks worse than it did originally.  
−2 Much worse  My treated cellulite looks much worse than it did originally.  
−3 Very much worse  My treated cellulite looks very much worse than it did originally.  
Subjects will enter their responses directly into an EDC system using a handheld tablet. Subjects 
will be instructed not to reveal their responses to the investigators or site personnel and the investigators or site personnel will not h ave access to view subjects’ responses.  
2.11.2. Investigator Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (I -GAIS)  
On Day  22, Day 43, and Day  71, the investigator will determine the degree of improvement of 
each of the buttocks by comparing the cellulite by live assessment  on Day 22, Day 43, and 
Day 71 to the Day 1 pre -treatment (Baseline) image of that buttock ( Table 4 ). The I- GAIS 
assessment will occur after the CR -PCSS assessment to avoid introducing potential bias to the 
static CR -PCSS assessment by the investigator at the site. The I -GAIS assessment wil l be 
conducted after the subject completes her assessments (PR -PCSS and/or S- GAIS).

   2.13. Weight, Height, and BMI  
At the Screening visit, height and weight measurements will be taken. Baseline body mass index 
(BMI) will be computed from these measurements as the weight in kilograms (kg) divided by 
height in meters squared (m2). Body weight will also be measured at the Day 22, Day 43, and 
Day 71 visits; BMI will be computed from each of these measurements using the height at 
screening.  
2.14. Adverse Events  
Medically significant changes that occur after enrollment into this study will be recorded as adverse events (AEs).  
The following information will be collected for  all AEs:  
• Verbatim description  
• Date of Onset  
• Date of Resolution/or Ongoing 
• Severity (Mild, Moderate, Severe)  
• Relationship to Study Drug (Not Related, Unlikely Related, Possibly Related, Probably Related)  
• Action taken with study drug (None, Drug Interrupted, Drug Withdrawn) 
• Outcome (Recovered/Resolved, Recovered/Resolved w/Sequelae, Recovering/ Resolving, Not Recovered/Not Resolved, Fatal, Unknown) 
• Whether the AE led to study discontinuation 
• Whether or not a concomitant medication or procedure was required  
• Classified as a serious adverse event (SAE) or not  
• SAE Code (Death, Life-threatening, Inpatient or prolonged hospitalization, Persistent or significant disability/incapacity, Congenital anomaly or birth defect, Other medically important event)  
• Designation of an AE of Special Interest: AEs including bruising, ecchymosis, hematomas, and contusions that occur remote  to the site of drug administration, or 
any hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, will be recorded as an AE of 
special int erest and reported as an AE or SAE as appropriate. In addition, local 
adverse events associated with the injection site, including bruising, pain, nodules/mass, ulceration, erythema, pruritus, swelling, and/or induration, will be recorded and evaluated for  seriousness and severity 

Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Module  1 – Study EN3835-302

   2.15. Medical History  
A medical history of the subject will be taken during the screening period. The onset and 
resolution date or ongoing will be recorded for each condition reported. If no part (including 
year) of the onset or resolut ion date is known, then the condition will be reported as occurring 
less than 5  years ago or more than or equal to 5 years ago.  
Medical history will also include a report of tobacco and alcohol use. For each item subjects are to report whether they never used, are currently using, or have formerly used. If subjects are a 
current or former user, they are to indicate the number of years they used the product, and former users are to indicate the stop date of using the product. 
For reproductive history, subje cts are to indicate the date of their last menstrual period and the 
number of pregnancies they have had. 
2.16. Edematous Fibrosclerotic Panniculopathy Disease History  
During the screening period an EFP disease history will be obtained from the subject. The EFP 
disease history will include onset date of EFP symptoms, previous treatments used for EFP, and 
family history of cellulite, answered as yes, no, or unknown for any family relation.  
2.17. Physical Examination  
During the screening period, the investigator will perform a physical examination (by body 
system) on each subject. Any abnormalities will be described.  
2.18. Vital Signs 
Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic), respiratory rate, pulse rate, and body temperature will be 
assessed at each study visit. On injection days, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and pulse rate 
will be measured prior to the injections (up to 4 hours prior to the injection), and at 15 and 30 minutes after the injection. If at the 30 -minute measurement, the vital signs are not stable, 
subjects will be required to remain at the site until all the vital signs are stable. The investigator will record only the last vital sign measurement prior to discharge. On injection days, body temperature will be taken only prior to the injection, at the 30-minute post -dose measurement, 
and, if necessary, at the prior to discharge measurement. On injection days, the time the vital signs are taken will also be recorded.  
2.19. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
During the screening period, subjects will have a resting 12- lead ECG. A q ualified physician will 
assess the ECG as normal, abnormal not clinically significant, or abnormal clinically significant. The investigator or qualified designee must sign and date the ECG, thereby acknowledging review of the ECG results. The investigator will be able to record any comments regarding the 
ECG, including explaining any abnormal findings or providing details if the ECG was not done 
per protocol.

reported. Included will be: 
• Verbatim name of medication  
• Medication start date  
• Medication end date or ongoing 
• Dose, units, frequency, and route of medication 
• Reason for medication (medical history, AE, prophylaxis, health maintenance, EFP/cellulite, birth control, or other) 
Additional space is available for comments regarding reason for medication, units, route, and frequency.  
2.24. Concomitant Procedures/Therapies  
Any procedures or therapies used during the study will be recorded. Any prior procedures for 
EFP/Cellulite or birth control should be reported. Included will be: 
• Verbatim description of the procedure 
• Start date  
• End date or ongoing

Additional space is available for comments regarding reason for procedure. 
3. STUDY PARAMETERS  
3.1. Subject Disposition  
Subjects will be considered as completing the study (ie,  completers) if they complete the Day  71 
visit. Subjects who do not complete the study will report their reason for early discontinuation. 
Time in the study (days) will be computed as the date of last visit minus the date of Day  1 + 1, 
where the date of the last visit is determined as the following:  
• The date o f Day  71 if the subject completes the study 
• The date of early termination visit if the subject is terminated early from study at a 
non-scheduled visit 
• The date of the latest scheduled visit if the subject is terminated early from study at a 
scheduled visit or lost to follow-up

   3.2. Number of Treatment Sessions  
A treatment session will be counted as given overall if at that treatment session a subject receives 
at least 1  injection of study drug in either or both of the buttocks. Total number of treatment 
sessions overall received will be calculated.  
For each of the buttocks (target or non-target buttock) , subjects who receive at least 1  injection 
of study medication on Day 1, Day  22, or Day 43 will be counted as having a treatment session. 
Subjects will be classif ied into cohorts by buttock based on the number of treatment sessions 
they have. The reason why a treatment session was not done will be obtained and classified into one of the following: 
• Early termination prior to visit  
• Visit not done 
• Visit done but no injections given due to no evident cellulite 
• Visit done but no injections given due to AE 
• Visit done but no injections given due to other reasons 
If a treatment session was done, subjects will be classified into one of the following per treatment sessions: 
• 12 injections per buttock given  
• Less than 12  injections per buttock given due to not enough evident dimples 
• Less than 12  injections per buttock given due to AE 
• Less than 12  injections per buttock given due to other reasons 
3.3. Early Termination Visit Assessments 
Subjects who discontinue early will have all Day 71 procedures and assessments completed at an early termination visit. Those assessments and measurements will not be used for the observed data analysis at Day  71 but for the Day 71 (last observation carried forward [LOCF]) analysis.  
3.4. Treatment Groups  
Subjects will be divided into 1 of 2 treatment groups based on their randomization. The 
2 treatment groups will be referred to as:  
• EN3835 1.68 mg total dose (0.84 mg per buttock) 
• Placebo  
These group assignments will remain regardless of the actual dose or type of study medication 
received. Subjects who receive a different dose or different study medication at any of the treatment sessions (due, for example, to a pharmacy error) from the treatment to which they were 
randomized will be summarized within their randomized group unless explicitly specified. These 
subjects will also be reported as a protocol deviation.

   3.5. Efficacy Parameters  
3.5.1. PR-PCSS  
3.5.1.1. Baseline PR -PCSS Rating  
For each buttock (target or non- target), the baseline PR -PCSS rating will be based on the 
subject’s PR -PCSS evaluation done at Day 1. If no evaluation is done for a buttock on Day 1 
(eg, done using an incorrect digital image), the rating of the subject’s PR -PCSS for that buttock 
at Screening  will be used for the baseline.  
3.5.1.2. Change from Baseline PR -PCSS Rating  
For each buttock (target or non- target), the change from baseline PR -PCSS rating will be the 
visit rating minus the baseline rating. A more negative change in rating indicates a greater 
improvement of cellulite severity in that buttock. 
3.5.1.3. Subject PR -PCSS Responders for Target Buttock  
A 2-level PR -PCSS responder for the target buttock is defined as a subject with an improvement

subject who is a 1- level S -GAIS responder for both buttocks at an evaluation time point. 
3.5.3. PR-CIS 
The PR -CIS total score will be the sum of the six items on the scales. Item #1 on the PR- CIS 
asking how happy the subject is about their appearance of cellulite will be reversed by 
subtracting the subject’s reported assessment from 10 ( ie, for purposes of the composite, scoring 
for the “ happy ” question was reversed (reflected) to make it directionally consistent with the 
other questions ). In this manner, a higher number on six of the PR- CIS questions will reflect a 
more negative impact. The PR -CIS total score can range from 0 to 60 with higher numbers 
reflecting more negative impact from the cellulite.  If scores on two or less of the 6 i tems are 
missing, the PR -CIS total score will be computed as the mean  of the answered items times  6. If 
scores on three or more of the six items are missing, then the PR -CIS total score will be set to 
missing.  

Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Module  1 – Study EN3835-302

   Similarly, the PR -CIS abbreviated total score will be the sum of the five items (Items  #1-4 and 
Item #6) on the scale (note that for the abbreviated total score Item #1 score should be replaced 
by subtracting the item score from 10) . The PR -CIS abbreviated total score can range from 0 to 
50 with higher numbers reflecting more negat ive impact from the cellulite. If scores on two or 
less of the 5 items are mis sing, the PR- CIS abbreviated total score will be computed as the mean

item at Day  1. 
3.5.3.2. Change from Baseline PR -CIS Item Scores  
The change from baseline PR -CIS item score will be the visit score minus the baseline score. For 
Item #1, a more positive change in score indicates a greater improvement of impact of the 
cellulite on subject’s happiness while for other items a more negative change in score indicates a 
greater reduction of impact of the cellulite on subject’s life.  
3.5.3.3. Responders Based o n PR -CIS Item Scores

3.6. Safety Parameters  
3.6.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be mapped to preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA). Treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are any AEs with a start 
date equal to or after the date of the first injection. Treatment- related AEs are any AEs with a 
relationship of possibly or probably related to study medication or AEs with a missing relationship. 
3.6.1.1. Adverse Event Treatment Session  
An AE’s association with a treatment session will be based on the start date of the AE compared 
to the date of the injection. Adverse events with a start date between the Day  1 visit date and the 
day prior to the next dose or , if no further dose, the last visit date in the study will be associated 
with Treatment Session 1. If study drug is administered at the Day  22 visit, AEs with a start date 
between the Day  22 visit date and the day prior to the next dose or, if no further dose, the last 
visit date in the study will be associated with Treatment Session  2. If study drug is administered 
at the Day  43 visit, AEs with a start date between the Day  43 visit date and the Day 71 visit date 
will be associated with Treatment Session  3.  

Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Module  1 – Study EN3835-302 
30-Aug-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 34 
   3.6.1.2. Adverse Event Duration  
Duration of an AE will be the AE end date minus the AE start date + 1. If AEs are still ongoing 
at the end of the study or AEs have partial start or stop dates, durations of those AEs are not 
determined.  
The duration of AEs will be used to determine the categories of AE durations (1-4 days, 
5-7 days, 8-14 days, 15- 21 days, and >21 days). For ongoing AEs, the category of AE duration 
will be missing unless those events have an onset date 21 days prior to the subject’s last visit in the study. In this case, the category of the AE du ration will be classified as “> 21 days”.  
3.6.2. Vital Signs and Clinical Laboratories 
3.6.2.1. Baseline Values and Change from Baseline Values  
The baseline values for vital signs (study baseline) and clinical laboratories will be the last 
available measurement prior to the first dose of study medication. For clinical laboratories this could be the screening value or it could be an unscheduled lab, if the unscheduled lab is the closest value preceding the first injection. For vital signs, baseline will be those taken at Day  1 
predose for the by- visit analyses.  
Vital signs will additionally be analyzed on each injection day. For each injection day, baseline (injection day baseline) will be a predose value taken on that day.  
Change from baseline will be the visit/time point value minus the baseline value.  
3.6.2.2. Sponsor -defined Potentially Clinically Important Laboratory Values 
Table 8 presents the criteria for determining potentially clinically important (PCI) laboratory 
values.

3.7. Other Parameters  
3.7.1. Immunogenicity  
Seropositivity and titer levels for both anti- AUX -I and anti- AUX -II antibodies individually will 
be determined from each analyzed sample. Samples with a positive titer value will undergo a log 
transformation for analyses. Samples with a titer level less than 1  will be assigned or imputed as 
a log transformed titer of zero (0) for statistical analyses.  
Samples to b e assayed for neutralizing antibodies for AUX- I and AUX-II will be obtained from a 
subset of seropositive binding antibodies samples on Day 1 and Day 71 (see section  2.22). 
Samples will be classified as positive or negative for neutralizing antibodies based on the results 
of these assays.  
3.7.2. Medical History  
Medical history will be mapped to preferred term using MedDRA. Subjects with medical histories of Dupuytren’s disease, Ledderhose’s disease, knuckle pads, diabetes, and epilepsy will be summarized. Subjects will be coded as having these disorders based on the preferred term of 
their reported medical histories. Knuckle pads will also include the preferr ed term of ‘Garrod 
pads’. Ledderhose’s disease will also include the preferred term of ‘fibromatosis’. Epilepsy will 
also include the preferred term of ‘convulsion’. Diabetes will include the preferred terms of 
‘diabetes mellitus’, ‘type 1 diabetes mellitus’, or ‘type 2 diabetes mellitus’. Diabetes will not 
include subjects who report ‘glucose tolerance impaired’ (borderline diabetes or pre- diabetes), 
‘diabetic vascular disorder’ or ‘blood glucose increased’. All medical history terms will be 
reviewed by th e study medical monitor to determine if any other terms should be included in the 
summary.  
Age at EFP symptoms onset will be computed as the date of the EFP symptoms reported on the medical history eCRF minus the date of birth divided by 365.25. If the date of EFP symptom 
onset is incomplete, the date will be imputed according to the rules set up in section  6.2.2.

30-Aug-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 36 
   3.7.3. Prior/Concomitant Medications  
All me dications will be coded with the World Health Organization (WHO) drug dictionary. A 
concomitant medication is any medication with a stop date on or after the date of the first 
injection or the medication is reported as ongoing. A prior medication is any me dication with a 
stop date prior to the date of the first injection. 
3.7.4. Prior EFP Treatment  
Prior EFP treatment will be obtained from the prior/concomitant medication and prior/ 
concomitant procedure pages of the eCRF. If on either of these pages a medication or treatment 
is reported with the indication ‘EFP/cellulite’ with a start date prior to the first dose of study medication, then the medication or procedure will be considered a prior EFP treatment. All 
medications will be classified as EFP drug. All proce dures will be classified into one of the 
following groups:  
• Liposuction 
• Laser treatments  
• Surgery (subcision or powered subcision) 
• Massage  
• Radiofrequency 
• Mesotherapy (including injections) 
• Cryolipolysis 
• Buttock implant treatment 
• Cream  
• Other  
The classificatio n will be reviewed and approved by the study medical monitor. Any EFP 
treatment used after the Day  1 visit will be noted and reported as a protocol violation. 
Time since the last EFP treatment will be computed as the date of the most recent EFP treatment minus the date the informed consent was signed divided by 365.25. If the date of any EFP 
treatments is incomplete, the date will be imputed according to the rules set up in section  6.2.2. 
4. ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
4.1. Safety Population  
The safety population is defined as all enrolled subjects who have at least 1 injection of study medication. All safety parameters will be summarized based on this population.  

Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Module  1 – Study EN3835-302 
30-Aug-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 37 
   4.2. Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT population is defined as all randomized subjects who have at least 1 injection of study 
medication. All demographic and baseline characteristic summaries will be based on this 
population. The primary and key secondary efficacy parameters will be summarized based on 
this population.  
4.3. Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Populatio n 
The mITT population is defined as all ITT subjects with a baseline and at least 1 post- injection 
evaluation of both the investigator CR-PCSS and subject PR-PCSS for both the target and 
non-target buttocks. All efficacy evaluations will be analyzed based on the mITT population. 
4.4. Per-Protocol (PP) Population  
The PP  population is defined as a subset of the mITT population who are considered compliant 
with the protocol to ensure the efficacy analysis most closely reflects the scientific model underlying the protocol.(1) 
Study subjects will be excluded from the PP population if they meet any of the following criteria:  
• Placebo  randomized subject who recei ves EN3835 treatment 
• EN3835 randomized subject who receives placebo treatment only throughout study 
• Any subject who receives protocol-prohibited medications 
• Subject missing  PR-PCSS and/or CR- PCSS assessment at Day  71 
• Subject with a buttock not receiving all three treatment sessions without medical 
reasons (eg , adverse events or CR -PCSS rated as zero (0) ) 
• Subject who did not meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria 
If more than 10% of the mITT population subjects are excluded from the PP population, then all efficacy summaries will be repeated for the PP  population. All protocol violations, major and 
minor, will be listed.  
5. STATISTICAL METHODS  
5.1. Overview  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be summarized as percentages and analyzed using a CMH 
test that compares the 2  treatment groups and adjusts for analysis center at a level of significance 
of 0.05 based on the ITT population. Any subject who does not have an evaluation of either 
CR-PCSS or PR -PCSS at Day  71 will be classified as a non -responder.  
The key secondary efficacy endpoints except for change from baseline in the PR- CIS total score 
at Day  71 will be summarized as percentages and analyzed using a CMH test that compares the 
2 treatment groups and adjusts for analysis center based on the ITT  population. Any subject who 
does not have an evaluation or assessment at Day 71 will be classified as a non -responder. The 
change from baseline in the PR -CIS total score at Day  71 will be summarized using descriptive 

Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Module  1 – Study EN3835-302 
30-Aug-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 38 
   statistics (n,  mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum) and analyzed by 
ANCOVA with a factor of treatment group and analysis center adjusting for baseline value. The 
key secondary efficacy Family  #1 analyses will be performed only if the primary effic acy 
analysis is significant at a significance level of p ≤ 0.05. Similarly key secondary efficacy 
Family  #2 analyses will be performed only if at least one of four key secondary efficacy 
Family  #1 endpoints is significant at a significance level of p ≤  0.0125 and key secondary 
efficacy Family  #3 analyses will be performed only if at least one of two key secondary efficacy 
Family  #2 endpoints is significant at a significance level of unused alpha from F amily  #1 divided 
by 2. Any subject who does not have a PR-CIS evaluation or assessment at Day 71 will be 
imputed as baseline value for the analysis. Within a family of key secondary efficacy endpoints a Bonferroni procedure will be performed to assure an overall type I error rate of no more 
than 0.05. 
All supportive efficacy endpoints will be summarized as percentages. All the supportive analyses 
are performed based on the observed data only at all the visits in the mITT population without 
multiplicity adjustment. An additional analysis will be performed at Day  71 with missing data at 
Day 71 handled by an LOCF approach if subjects have at least one post- dose evaluation. If a 
subject does not have any post-dose evaluation, analysis value will be missing (not imputed). The dichotomous secondary endpoints (ie, respo nder endpoints) will be analyzed using a CMH 
test adjusted for analysis center. Changes in the PR -PCSS ratings and CR- PCSS ratings from 
baselines, S -GAIS ratings, and I-GAIS ratings will be analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum 
test. Changes from baselines in PR- CIS individual items, total scores or abbreviated total scores 
will be analyzed using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for baseline values.  
The AE endpoints will be summarized as count and percentages by preferred term and by treatment gr oup and p values will be obtained from the Fisher exact test to test treatment 
difference of incidence. The change from baseline for vital signs and clinical laboratory 
parameters are compared between EN3835 and placebo using an analysis of variance (ANOVA ) 
with a factor of drug (EN3835 or placebo) while the Fisher exact test will be used for the incidence of PCI values.  
The following SAS code will be used for CMH test:  
Proc Freq data=<dataset>;     Table CENTER*DRUG*OCCUR/CMH;  
Run; 
Where CENTER is the analysis center, DRUG is the randomized treatment group (EN3835 1.68 mg total dose or placebo) and OCCUR is the incidence of the event variable.  
The following SAS code will be used for Wilcoxon rank sum test:  
Proc NPAR1WAY data=<dataset> Wilcoxon; 
    Class DRUG;  
    Var DEPVAR;  
Run; 
Where DRUG is the randomized treatment group (EN3835 1.68 mg total dose or placebo) and DEPVAR is the dependent variable.  

Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Module  1 – Study EN3835-302 
30-Aug-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 39 
   The following SAS code will be used for the Fisher exact test:  
Proc Freq data=<dataset>; 
    Table DRUG*DEPVAR/Fisher;  
Run; 
Where DRUG is the randomized treatment group (EN3835 1.68 mg total dose or placebo) and OCCUR is the incidence of the event variable.  
The following SAS code will be used for ANCOVA with a factor of treatment group adjusted for 
baseline:  
Proc GLM data=<dataset>;     Class DRUG;  
    Model DEPVAR = DRUG CENTER BASE / ss3;  
Run; 
Where DRUG is the randomized treatment group (EN3835 1.68 mg total dose or placebo), CENTER is the analysis center, DEPVAR is the dependent variable, and BASE is the value of 
the dependent variable at baseline.  
The following SAS code will be used for ANOVA with a factor of treatment group:  
Proc GLM data=<dataset>;     Class DRUG;  
    Model DEPVAR = DRUG / ss3;  
Run; 
Where DRUG is the randomized treatment group (EN3835 1.68 mg total dose or placebo) and 
DEPVAR is the dependent variable.  
5.2. Analysis Center s 
Small centers will be combined into analysis centers for the CMH analyses. A ny site with at least 
8 subjects per treatment arm will stand alone as an analysis center .  The smallest sites are to be 
pooled together until the analysis center has at least 8  subjects per treatment arm. The next larger 
centers will be then pooled together to reach at least 8  subjects per treatment arm, etc ., until all 
analysis centers have at least 8  subjects per treatment arm. If the last pooled analysis center does 
not have at least 8  subjects per treatment arm, it will be pooled into the previously pooled center. 
If two or more small sites enrolled the same number of subjects in the study, the smaller number 
of subjects of either of the two treatment groups within a site or site ID number will be used to 
break the tie:  
• The site with the lowest number of subjects in either treatment group will be pooled 
first. 
• In the event the sites have the same lowest number of subjects in either treatment group, then the site with the lower site ID will be pooled first.  
Consistency of treatment response across analysis centers for the primary endpoint will be 
assessed by plotting the proportion of responders on the EN3835 arm versus the proportion of responders on the placebo arm by center. Additionally, site to site variability as well as analysis 
center to center variability will be assessed by the Breslow -Day test.

   5.3. Missing Data Handling  
Missing efficacy data will be imputed or handled prior to each pre- specified statistical analysis 
by one of the following: 
• Missing data points are imputed as baseline values. For responder analysis, m issing 
data are considered as non -responders

5.4. Subjects Given Incorrect Treatment  
All the efficacy analyses will be performed based on the randomized (ITT) treatment group 
regardless of actual treatments. All safety analyses will be based on actual treatment received by 
subjects and for overall summary any subjects who received EN3835 in at least 1  treatment 
session will be included in the EN3835 group and subjects who only received placebo during the 
study will be included in the placebo group. 
5.5. Subject Disposition

5.9.3. Primary Endpoint  
The rate of subjects who are 2 -level composite responders (see section  3.5.8.3) for the target 
buttock will be summarized by treatment group with counts and percentages based on the 
ITT population. P  value (raw p value for the multiplicity test) will be computed using CMH test 
adjusted for analysis center (see section  5.1). A cross -tabulation summary of subject 2- level 
responders versus investigator 2-level responders for the target buttock will be presented by treatment group.  
If the 2 -level composite respon der status of the target buttock cannot be determined at Day 71, 
ie, the target buttock is missing a CR -PCSS rating, a PR -PCSS rating, or both, then the subject 
will be classified as a non -responder of the target buttock .  
5.9.4. Key Secondary Endpoints – Family  #1 
The 1 -level PR -PCSS responders for the target buttock (see section  3.5.1.3), the 2- level 
PR-PCSS responders for the target buttock (see section  3.5.1.3), the 1- level composite 
responders for the target buttock (see section  3.5.8.1), and the 2- level composite responders for 
the non- target buttock (see section  3.5.8.2) at Day  71 will be summarized by treatment group 

Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Module  1 – Study EN3835-302 
30-Aug-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 45 
   with counts and percentages based on the ITT population. Any missing value at Day 71 will be 
imputed as a non-responder in the analysis. P values (raw p values for the multiplicity test) will 
be computed using CMH test adjusted for analysis center (see section  5.1).  
The inference for each of 4  key secondary Family  #1 endpoints is primarily based on the results 
at the Day  71 using the Bonferroni method if and only if the primary endpoint is claimed 
statistically significant (raw p value<0.05). 
5.9.5. Key Secondary Endpoints – Family  #2 
The 1 -level SSRS responders (see section  3.5.4.2) and the change from baseline in the PR- CIS 
total score  (see section  3.5.3.9) at Day  71 will be summarized by treatment group with counts 
and percentages based on the ITT  population. Any missing value at Day 71 will be imputed as a 
non-responder or a baseline value in the analysis. P values (raw p values for the multiplicity test)  
will be computed using CMH test adjusted for analysis center (see section  5.1).  
The inference for each of 2  key secondary Family  #2 endpoints is c onducted if and only if at 
least one of 4  key secondary endpoints in the first family is claimed statistically significant (raw 
p value<0.0125). Unused alpha (0.05, 0.0375, 0.025, 0.0125 corresponding to 4, 3, 2, or 1 of the 
key secondary endpoints in the first Family being statistically significant, respectively) from the Family  #1 tests will be carried over to the inference of 2  key secondary endpoints in the second 
Family. The inference for each of 2  key secondary Family #2 endpoints will be based on the raw 
p value, unused alpha and the Bonferroni method for alpha spending.  
5.9.6. Key Secondary Endpoints – Family  #3 
The 1 -level S -GAIS responders for the target buttock and the 2- level S -GAIS responders for the 
target buttock (see section  3.5.2.2) at Day  71 will be summarized by treatment group with counts 
and percentages based on the ITT  population. Any missing value at Day 71 will be imputed as a 
non-responder in the analysis. P values (raw p values for the multiplicity test) will be computed 
using CMH test adjusted for analysis center (see section  5.1).  
The inference for each of 2  key secondary Family  #3 endpoints is conducted if and only if at 
least one of 2 key secondary endpoints in the second family is claimed statistically significant 
(raw p value<half of the unused alpha from the Family #1). Unused alpha from Family #2 tests, ie, half of unused alpha from the Family #1 tests multiplied by number of endpoints in the 
Family  #2 that are deemed statistically significant from the multiple tests, will be carried over to 
the inference of 2  key s econdary endpoints in the 3
rd Family. The inference for each of 2  key 
secondary Family  #3 endpoints will be based on the raw p value, unused alpha and the 
Bonferroni method for alpha spending.  
5.9.7. Sensitivity Analyses 
The following sensitivity analyses will be conducted for the primary efficacy endpoint. Selected 
sensitivity analyses will be conducted for key secondary efficacy endpoints, as indicated below. 
The ITT population will be used for sensitivity analyses unless otherwise noted.

   5.9.7.1. Multiple Imputation (MI)  for Missing Data 
Primary Endpoint : 2-level composite responders for the target buttock,   
Key Secondary endpoints: 1 -level composite responders for the target buttock and 2- level 
composite responders for the non -target buttock  
A sensitivity analysis examining the potential impact of missing data on the result of the primary 
efficacy analysis will be performed using multiple imputation. The individual components 
(PR-PCSS and CR-PCSS) of the primary endpoint (two- level composite responders of the target 
buttock at Day 71) will be imputed separately on the original 5- point ordinal scales (rating 0 -4) 
within each treatment group with missing values.  Multiple datasets  (100 datasets) will be 
generated using the logistic  regression method in SAS PROC MI. The logistic models for Day 71 
PR-PCSS and Day 71 CR- PCSS will include the ‘core’ variables, baseline value, and value at a 
previous visit. The core variables include age, baseline BMI, Fitzpatrick skin type (I- III versus  
IV-VI), and number of treatments received. A pre -specified seed will be used in SAS procedure 
PROC M I which is listed in Table 11. The imputed primary composite endpoint will be derived 
based on the imputed individual components (Day 71 PR-PCSS and Day 71 CR- PCSS) . Each 
imputed dataset will be analyzed via the CMH test, adjusting for analysis  center. The values of 
the general association test statistic from the CMH analysis will be transformed using the 
Wilson -Hilferty transformation  (2) to create a more normally distributed statistic :

The resulting transformed values will be pooled using PROC MIANALYZE in SAS to yield the 
corresponding pooled p value.

   on the raw reported scales and then the responder variables will be derived based on the imputed 
raw reported scales.  
Key Secondary Endpoints – Continuous Endpoint section 5.9.5 
  Change from baseline in PR -CIS total score  
For this variable, the imputation will be performed on the endpoint directly by using the linear 
regression method in SAS PROC MI within each treatment group with missing data. The 
regression model will include t he ‘core’ variables  and corresponding baseline value. 
Once all the missing data are imputed, each set of imputed data will be analyzed and the 
resulting statistics from 100 sets will be combined using PROC MIANALYZE for the statistical 
inference from the A NCOVA with factor variables: treatment group and analysis center, and 
covariate variable: baseline PR -CIS total score. The resulting least square means (LSMEANs) 
and standard errors (SEs) of the LSMEANs will be pooled using PROC MIANALYZE to yield the corr esponding p value. 
5.9.7.2. Tipping Point Analysis  
A sensitivity analysis examining the robustness of the results of the primary efficacy analysis to 
assumptions about missing data will be performed using a Tipping Point (TP) analysis. More 
specifically, the TP analysis will examine under what conditions the conclusion of the study remains unchanged, even if the missing data mechanism depends on the unobservable missing 
values and the data are Missing Not At Random (MNAR). 
In the TP analysis, missing values of the composite primary efficacy endpoint (2-point composite 
responder for target buttock at Day 71) will be assigned based on treatment group and analysis  
center.   
Define the following values based on the observed data: 
m
p = the number of subjects in the placebo group with missing primary efficacy endpoint 
mt = the number of subjects in the EN3835 group with missing primary efficacy endpoint 
The basis of the TP analysis will be an m p -by- m t grid with m t values along the x- axis and m p 
values along the y -axis.  Each grid point (i,j) will contain a summary statistic s ij corresponding to 
the result of the primary analysis with random responder assignment of missing data such that there are i additional responders in the EN3835 group and j additional responders in the placebo group.   
First, the data is analyzed under the “worst case” conditions.  In this step, all subjects in the 
placebo group with missing primary efficacy endpoint are assumed to be responders and all subjects i n the EN3835 group are assumed to be non-responders. This is a distinct condition from 
that of the data from the main analysis in which all subjects with missing outcome are assumed to be non-responders, regardless of treatment group. The “worst case” dataset is analyzed using the same methodology as that for the primary endpoint defined in s ection  5.9.3 (ie,  using CMH 
test adjusted for analysis center). If the result of the analysis of the “worst case” dataset supports 
the conclusion of the main study analysis (ie,  both analyses provide statistically significant 
evidence for a positive treatment effect), then there is no need to implement the full TP analysis 
and the result of the main study analysis is robust to assumptions about the missing efficacy data.   

Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Module  1 – Study EN3835-302 
30-Aug-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 48 
   If the analysis of the “worst case” dataset reverses the conclusion of the main study analysis, 
then the TP analysis will be performed by  perform ing responder assignment based on treatment 
group and analysis  center, and calculating summary statistics s ij for additional grid points (i,j).  
Starting at the at grid location corresponding to the “worst case” condition (0, m p) an incremental 
step in both directions will be taken to grid location (1, m p -1).  For the responder assignment, 
the number of datasets D ijz will be generated, taking analysis center into account, depending on 
the number of patients with missing data at specific analysis centers.   
Each dataset D ijz is analyzed using the same methodology as that for the primary endpoint 
defined in s ection  5.9.3 (i e, using CMH test adjusted for analysis center).  The results of the 
analysis over all D ijz are summarized using a pooled p value from the v ij datasets, based on the 
method of Wilson -Hilferty transformation . The pooled p value from this set of datasets will be 
the summary statistic s ij for grid location (i,j). If at any point summary statistic s ij is not less than 
the critical p value defined in s ection  5.9.3, and therefore revers es the conclusion of the primary 
analysis of the study, then that point represents one condition of the Tipping Point. 
The TP analysis will continue at grid locations (2, m p -2), (3, m p -3), etc., by repeating the 
process of random responder assignment, analyzing the data, then calculating the pooled p value 
until the first location of  the Tipping Point is reached. Once one grid location of the Tipping 
Point is found, all eight adjacent grid locations will be searched to reveal additional Tipping Point grid  locations. The process will be repeated until all Tipping Point grid locations are found. 
A summary table and a figure will be presented for the TP analysis which will display the 
collection of points identified as the Tipping Points. 
5.9.7.3. Missing Data Handled by a Last Observation (Post- dose) Carried Forward 
(LOCF)  
Missing data at Day  71 will be imputed as follows: 
• If the subject has at least one post -dose classification then the last classification will be 
carried forward for Day  71 for the analysis 
• If the subject has no post- dose classification then the baseline value will be carried 
forward for Day  71 for the analysis 
5.9.7.4. Other Sensitivity Analyses  
The primary efficacy endpoint and all the key secondary efficacy endpoints will be summarized 
by treatment group with descriptive statistics based on the PP  population if the number of 
subjects in the PP population is 90% or less than those in the mITT population, ie , if more than 
10% of subjects are excluded in the PP population compared to those in the mITT population. P value will be computed using ANCOVA with factors of treatment group and analysis center adjusting for baseline value for change from baseline in the PR -CIS score or CMH test adjusted 
for analysis center for other efficacy endpoints (see section  5.1). In addition, similar summary 
and statistical analysis will be performed based on the observed data at Day  71, ie, using 
observed data  without missing data imputed, for the mITT population as well as the 
PP population if more than 10% of subjects are excluded in the PP population compared to those in the mITT population.

where missing values will not be imputed (observed data only). In addition, all the supportive efficacy endpoints with missing data handled using the LOCF approach will be performed at Day 71. If no classification post the initial treatment is available then the subject will be 
excluded in the analyses.  
Analysis summaries will be performed by either the target buttock, the non-target buttock, at least one buttock, or both buttocks in the same individual subject.

Percentages for the total number of mild, moderate, and severe AEs will be based on the total 
number of all AEs in the treatment group. 
The by frequency summaries will also include the total number of occurrences the AE preferred 
term was reported as well the number of subjects with at least 1  report of the AE. Most common 
non-SAEs are any preferred term AE that at least 5% of the subjects in 1  treatme nt group report 
at least once. Adverse events that are classified as most common in at least 1  treatment group 
will be reported in all treatment groups.

   5.10.1.1. Adverse Event Conventions  
The following conventions will be followed: 
• Table by preferred term - If an A E preferred term occurred multiple times within a 
body system for the same subject, the preferred term will only be counted once for the 
subject for the summary of preferred terms. If an AE body system occurred multiple 
times for the same subject, the body system will only be counted once for the subject for the summary of body systems. If a subject has any AE, the subject will be counted 
once in the summary of subjects with at least 1 AE.  
• Table by preferred term and severity - If an AE preferred term occur red multiple 
times within a body system for the same subject, only the most severe one will be 
used. If the most severe preferred term of an AE occurred multiple times within a body system for the same subject, only 1 will be counted. In addition, this sum mary 
will also contain the total number of subjects with at least 1 mild, 1 moderate, or 1 severe. If a subject has at least 1  severe AE, then the subject will be counted in the 
severe category. If the subject has no severe AEs, but at least 1  moderate AE,  then the 
subject will be counted in the moderate category, and if the subject has no severe and no moderate AEs, but has at least 1 mild AE, then the subject will be counted in the mild category.  
• Table by preferred term and treatment session – If an AE pr eferred term occurred 
multiple times within a body system for the same subject within a treatment session, the preferred term will only be counted once for the subject in the treatment session for the summary of preferred terms. If an AE preferred term occ urred multiple times 
within a body system for the same subject in different treatment sessions, the preferred term will be counted at each treatment session. If an AE body system occurred multiple times for the same subject within a treatment session, the body 
system will only be counted once for the subject in the treatment session for the 
summary of body systems. If an AE body system occurred multiple times for the same subject in different treatment sessions, the body system will be counted at each 
treatment session for the summary of body systems. If a subject has any AE within a 
treatment session, the subject will be counted once in the treatment session in the 
summary of subjects with at least 1  AE. If a subject has any AE in different treatment 
sessio ns, the subject will be counted in each treatment session in the summary of 
subjects with at least 1  AE. 
• Table of treatment -related AEs by duration category – This summary will be based on 
individual events rather than subjects. Each related AE will be classified into one of duration categories (1 -4 days, 5-7 days, 8-14 days, 14-21 days, or >21 days) based on 
its duration. If an AE preferred term occurred within a body system multiple times for the same subject, each occurrence will be counted in the summar y. In addition, all 
related AEs by treatment will also be included in this summary. If the AE is reported 
as ongoing or the AE stop date is missing or incomplete, the AE duration will not be 
computed and the AE will not be included in the duration analysis.

30-Aug-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 58 
   • Table of frequency of preferred terms – Preferred terms will be ordered by their 
descending frequency within the EN3835 treatment group. If 2 or more preferred 
terms are tied in their frequency, then the preferred terms will be ordered alphabetically.  
5.10.2. Weight and BMI  
Weight and BMI at baseline, visit (Day  22, Day  43, and Day 71) and change from baseline will 
be summarized by treatment group.  
5.10.3. Vital Signs  
Vital signs at baseline (Day  1 pre -injection), all study visits (Day  22 pre- injection, Day  43 
pre-injec tion, and Day 71) and change from baseline (study baseline) will be summarized by 
treatment group. P values for change from baseline will be based on the ANOVA with a factor of 
treatment group.  
Vital signs on injection day will be summarized at baseline (pre -injection), all post- injection time 
points (15 minutes and 30 minutes) and change from baseline by treatment group. The baseline 
value will be based on the pre- injection measurement at each treatment session.  
The incidence of subjects with sponsor- defined PCI vital sign values (see  Table 9) at any time 
during the study (including post-30- minute measurements) will be presented by treatment group. 
P values for the incidence of subjects with sponsor-defined PCI vital sign values will be based on 
the Fisher exact test.  
Any subject with at least 1  PCI vital sign will have all vital sign values listed.  
5.10.4. Clinical Laboratory 
Clinical laboratory results (hematology and chemistry only) at baseline, Day 71, and change from baseline will be summarized by treatment group. Routine urinalysis results will not be summarized. Any hematology or chemistry lab result not reported as a continuous value will not 
be in cluded in the summaries. P values for change at Day  71 from baseline will be based on the 
ANOVA with a factor of treatment group.  
All post-injection laboratory values (Day 71 and unscheduled labs taken on Day 1 or later) will be used to determine the incidence of PCI laboratory values. The incidence of subjects with 
sponsor- defined PCI laboratory values (see Table 8) will be presented. P values for the incidence 
of subjects with sponsor- defined PCI laboratory values will be based on the Fisher exact test.  
Any subject with at least 1  PCI laboratory value will have all the values for that analyte listed.  
5.10.5. Immunogenicity  
Anti-AUX-I and anti- AUX- II antibody titer levels will be analyzed at Day  1, Day  22, Day 43, 
and Day 71 by treatment group. The immunogenicity analysis will summarize the number of 
subjects with an immunogenicity sample tested, the percent of subjects with a positive sample, 
and the average t iter level of the positive samples. The titer levels will be log 10  transformed 
prior to being summarized. 

Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Module  1 – Study EN3835-302 
30-Aug-2018 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 59 
   The Day  71 LOCF anti- AUX-I and anti- AUX- II antibody titer levels will be summarized by 
treatment session cohorts (subjects with 1, 2, or 3 treatment cycles) and treatment group. 
The number and percentage of assayed serum samples that will detect the presence or absence of 
neutralizing antibodies (positive/negative) to AUX -I and AUX- II will be summarized by anti-
drug antibody quartiles for the EN3835- treated subjects with descriptive statistics (number and 
percentage) at Day  1 and Day 71. 
5.10.6. Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be summarized for preferred term (generic name from WHO dictionary) by treatment group. If 2 medications are coded to the same preferred term, it will be 
counted only once for a subject. Medications will be ordered alphabetically by drug class and 
preferred term within drug class.  
6. DERIVED VARIABLES  
6.1. Subject Level Variables  
The following variables will be determined for  each subject (see Table 12). 
Table 12: Subject Level Derived Dataset Variables  
Variable  Definition  
Age Group  <35 years  
35 – <45 years  
45 – <65 years  
≥65 years  
Height (cm)  If height unit is inches, then height is equal to the recorded value multiplied 
by 2.54 and then rounded to 1 decimal point.  
Weight (kg)  If weight unit is pounds, then weight is equal to the recorded value multiplied 
by 0.454 and then rounded to 1 decimal point.  
BMI (kg/m2) Weight/(Height/100)2 
BMI Group  Underweight (<18.5 kg/m2) 
Normal Weight (18.5 – <25.0 kg/m2) 
Overweight (25.0 – <30.0 kg/m2) 
Obese (≥30.0 kg/m2) 
Date of First Injection  Day 1 visit date  
Last Date in Study  Date of last visit where subject was seen by the investigator.  
If subject was lost to follow -up, then last date of contact. If the subject had 
contact with the site after the final visit (eg, to follow -up on an AE), the last 
visit date will still be used as last date in the study.  
Time in Study  Last Date in Study – Date  of First Injection + 1  
Age at EFP Symptom Onset  Start Date of EFP Symptom Onset (from medical history) – Date of 
Birth/365.25, truncated to integer value. See section  6.2.2  for handling of 
partial or unknown EFP symptom onset dates.  
AE=Adverse event; BMI=Body mass index; EFP=Edematous fibrosclerotic panniculopathy

   6.2. Safety Variables  
6.2.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be organized in 2 different ways: by event and by subject. The by event 
dataset will include all the characteristics of the event obtained on the eCRF plus the derived 
variables presented in Table  13. A second by event dataset will be created for the AE duration 
analysis. This duration dataset will contain only the subject number, treatment session, body 
system classification, preferred term, and duration.  
Table 13: Adverse Event Variables by Event  
Variable  Values/Definition  
Treatment -Emergent  AE with a start date after the first dose of study medication  
Treatment -Related  If relationship to study medication is reported as possible, probable or missing; ‘unlikely 
related’ AE will be classified as not a treatment -related AE.  
Onset Day  AE Start Date - Date of First Injection + 1  
Duration  AE Stop Date - AE Start Date + 1  
Treatment Session  The number of the treatment session immediately preceding the AE onset date  
AE=Adverse event  
The by -subject dataset will summarize all the AE events for a subject and will include the 
variables presented in Table 14. The same variables will be computed for TEAEs and treatment-
related AEs.  
Table 14: Adverse Event Variables by Subject  
Variable  Values/Definition  
Total AEs  Sum of number of AEs the subject reported  
Total Mild AEs  Sum of number of mild AEs the subject reported  
Total Moderate AEs  Sum of number of moderate AEs the subject reported  
Total Severe AEs  Sum of number of severe AEs the subject reported  
Had AE  Flag (Y/N) to indicate subject had at least 1  AE 
Had Severe AE  Flag (Y/N) to indicate subject had at least 1  AE of moderate or severe severity  
Had SAE  Flag (Y/N) to indicate subject had at least 1  serious AE  
Had AE Leading to 
Discontinuation  Flag (Y/N) to indicate subject had at least 1  AE that lead to discontinuation from the study  
AE=Adverse event; SAE=Serious adverse event; Y/N=Yes /No 
6.2.2. Laboratory Variables 
Laboratory variable, Creatinine clearance (eCrCl), will be derived by Endo using the 
Cockcroft- Gault formula (3) as follows: 
eCrCl (mL/min) = {[(140 -age) × weight]/[72 × Scr]} × 0.85 for female,  
where age is expressed in years (y), weight is expressed in kilograms (kg), and serum creatinine concentrati on (Scr) is expressed in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).

   6.3. Imputation of Partial Dates 
Study visit dates, birthdates, informed consent date, injection dates/times, all assessment dates, 
all lab dates, and date of completion/last contact date must be complete dates; no imputations 
will be done. No imputations will be done for partial medical history onset/resolution dates 
(except EFP onset date), partial alcohol/tobacco stop dates, partial AEs onset/end dates and partial concomitant medication/procedur e start/stop dates. All AEs with a missing onset day will 
be considered treatment -emergent except if the onset month/year is prior to the first injection 
date. All medications/procedures with a missing onset and stop day will be considered concomitant except if the stop month/year is prior to the first injection date.  
For EFP onset date and prior EFP medications/treatment dates, missing onset days will be 
imputed with the first day of the month and missing onset month will be imputed with January. If the E FP onset date is indicated as completely unknown but starting less than 5 years ago, the 
EFP onset date will be imputed as the informed consent date minus 5 years. If the EFP onset date 
is indicated as completely unknown but starting more than 5 years ago,  the EFP onset date will 
not be imputed. Missing EFP medication/ treatment end days will be imputed with the last day of 
the month and missing end months will be imputed with December, except if the end year is equal to the date of injection year and then t he EFP medication/treatment end date will be 
imputed with the first injection date.  
6.4. Relative Study Day/Treatment Session Study Day  
Relative study day will be computed for each visit and for each AE. For visits or events 
occurring on or after the Day  1 visi t, relative study day will be the date of visit (event) minus the 
date of first injection  + 1. For visits or events that occur prior to the Day 1 visit, the relative study  
day will be the date of visit (event) minus the date of first injection.  
Adverse ev ents will have a treatment session study day, computed as the date of event minus the 
date of preceding injection + 1.  
6.5. Conventions and Algorithms  
6.5.1. Summary Tables/Subject Listings Conventions  
Summary tables, subject listings, graphs and any supportive SAS output will include a “footer” 
of explanatory notes that will indicate, when applicable:  
• Date of data extraction  
• Date and time of output generation 
• SAS program name, including the path, that generates the output 
Null summary tables will be presented with a  note stating that “No Subjects Met Criteria.”  
The summary tables will clearly indicate the effective sample size per treatment group. All 
summary tables involving percentages will round the percentages off to 1 decimal place. All summary tables involving descriptive statistics of continuous variables will round the mean and 
median to 1 decimal place more than the variable’s standard form and round the standard

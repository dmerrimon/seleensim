Page 4 of 13 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  April 5, 2019  2 INTRODUCTION  
Recent studies have demonstrated that vertebrogenic pain from degenerated or damaged 
vertebral endplates is an important source of chronic low back pain ( CLBP ).1-6  Vertebal  
endplate damage can lead to cellular communication between the disc nucleus and the 
bone marrow, triggering inflammation  in the intraosseous space .4   The basivertebral 
nerve (BVN) within the vertebral disc has nociceptors  that receive pain signals from t he 
damaged and inflamed endplate  and transmit these pain signals to the central nervous 
system .  Endplate damage and i nflammation of the intraosseous space  are visible as 
Modic changes on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).4 
 
The Intracept device is a minima lly-invasive intervention  using a transpedicular approach 
to deliver radiofrequency (RF) energy to ablate  the BVN .  Once ablated, these nerves no 
longer transmit pain signals.   The Intracept® Intraosseous Nerve Ablation System is FDA 
510(k) cleared and CE Marked for the ablation of basivertebral nerves of the L3 through 
S1 vertebrae for the relief of chronic low back pain of at least 6 months’ duration that has 
not responded to at least 6 mont hs of conservative care, and is also accompanied by either 
Type 1 or Type 2 Modic changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  
Following a successful pilot study7, a 2:1 randomized, double -blind, sham -controlled 
trial demonstrated the safety and efficacy o f intraosseous RF ablation of the BVN to 
treat CLBP in patients with Modic type 1 or 2 changes of the vertebral endplates. The 
SMART trial was conducted between 2011 to 2014 and enrolled 225 subjects at 15 sites 
(N=202) in the United States and 3 sites (N= 23) in Europe.8 The primary requirements 
for inclusion in the trial were CLBP with a duration greater than 6 months; CLBP non -
responsive to at least 6 months of non -surgical management; and Modic Type 1 or 2 
changes at the vertebral endplates of the levels  targeted for treatment.  
The primary efficacy endpoint for the original study was the 3 -month change in Oswestry 
Disability Index ( ODI) compared between the study arms.  This comparison, as 
previously reported,8 found that at 3 months the per-protocol (PP)  treatment group 
exhibited a 20.5 Least Squares Mean (LSM) improvement in ODI compared to a 15.2 
LSM improvement in the sham group ( p = 0.019).  The PP treatment arm  subjects  
exhibited a durable ODI mean improvement (23.4 points) at 24  months . 9  In terms of 
percent improvement in ODI from baseline, these results translate into mean percentage  
improvements of 46.2% at 12 months and 53.7% at 24 months.   Responder rates for ODI 
and low back pain visual analogue scale ( VAS ) were also maintained through two years, 
with patients showing clinically meaningful improvements in both: ODI ≥ 10 -point 
improvement in 76.4 percent of patients and ODI ≥ 20-point improvement in 57.5 
percent; VAS ≥ 1.5 cm improvement in 70.2 percent of patients. Patients receiving the 
Intracept Procedure also decreased utilization of opioids and spinal injections as 
compared to utilization prior to treatment.  
 
The purpose of this study is to measure the 5+ year effectiveness outcomes in subjects 
treated with the Intracept Procedure in this original SMART study population.

 Overview  
The SMART 5 -Year study is a prospective multi -center, noninterventional, observational 
post market data collection of the 5+ year effectiveness and satisfaction outcomes for the 
SMART trial treatment arm population.   This trial will be conducted according to Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines , including  informed consent and Independent Review 
Board (IRB) approval and oversight .  
 Objective  
To evaluate the 5+ year effectiveness outcomes  of the Intracept Procedure  for the relie f of 
CLBP  in the SMART trial treatment arm subjects . 
 Scope  and Study Population  
This study is a post -market,  non-interventional , data collection of the 5+ year follow -up in 
the 133 treated subjects in the SMART trial  in the U.S .  The study  will be conducted at the 
same thirteen U.S. study sites where the procedures occurred .  U.S. subjects  who were 
randomized to the treatment  arm of the original SMART trial are eligible to participate in 
this 5+ year follow -up data collection .   
 Study Durat ion 
Participants in the study will have a single study visit.  Participants will be consented and 
then evaluated via a single telephone study  visit.  
4 PROTOCOL  
This study entails contacting original SMART trial treatment arm subjects to seek 
participation in a data collection of current pain , functional status, and recent treatments.   
The study will be overseen at each participating study site by a primary  investigator and 
clinical research coordinator  (CRC) . Telephone visits and data collect ion will conducted 
by an independent study -wide clinical research nurse  (CRN) .  
Five-Plus Year Follow -up Visit  
Study subjects who were randomized to the treatment arm and received treatment in the 
original SMART trial  are eligible to participate in this 5+ year follow -up data collection . 
Each  study site will make initial contact with the prior study patient and discuss the 
SMART 5+ year data collection and  discern  if the prior subject is interested  in 
participating.  I nformed consent will be obtained , and the  same unique subject ID # used 
in the  SMART trial will be assigned to the subject.   Study participant logs will  include  
subject ID, date(s) of contact,  and date of consent /decline to partic ipate and will be 
maintain ed by the study site  and independent CRN .   
Upon  subject agree ment  to participate in the study, t he CRC  will forward subject contact 
information to  the independent CRN who will then ensure informed consent and  schedule 
the telephone study visit .  The independent CRN will perform the  telephone study visit  and 
will be responsible for collection of  all data elements  on source document worksheets

7 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
 Oswestry Disability Index  
The Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI) is a validated questionnaire  of low back  pain-
related disability.10  It assesses  the impact of low back pain on activities of daily living 
and participation  and includes 10 questions .  It is scored on a scale of 0 (no disability) to 
100 (complete disability), with categories of 0 -20 (minimal disability), 21 -40 (moderate 
disability), 41 -60 (severe disability), 61 -80 (crippling back pain), and 81 -100 (bed -bound 
or exaggerating).  The minimally clinically important difference for this tool  is 
considered to be 10 points .11.  For the purposes of this study, this will be administered 
over the phone.  
 Pain Rating  Scale for Back Pain Assessment  
The pain rating scale that will be used for this study  is a 10 -point  numeric scale  based on 
the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain rating questionnaire12 used during the SMART 
study , 0 being no pain and 10  being worst imaginab le pain .  Respondents are asked to 
indicate what integer on the scale correspon ds to their perceived level of pain in their low 
back .  Subjects will be specifically instructed to report their  level of low back pain as an  
average for the last seven days .  Studies have shown that a minimally clinically important 
difference in VAS is considered to be approximately 1.5  points .13   For the purposes of 
this study, this will be administered over the phone.  
 Patient Satisfaction  
Satisfaction will be assessed with a short, non -validated questionnaire about degree of 
improvement, satisfaction with treatment, and willingness to repeat the treatment for the 
same outcome . 
 Narcotic  Medications  & Injections  
Patient -reported low back narcotic usage will be captured at the 5+ year follow up visit .  
Drug type, prescribed dosage,  and average daily dose for the  last 30 days  will be 
documented on the source document worksheet .  
Patient -reported injections within the last 12 months  will be collected.  Date, type, and 
location for each injection will be recorded.  
Relievant Medsystems   INTRACEPT CIP 00 11, Rev A 
Page 8 of 13 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  April 5, 2019  
 Surgical Interventions  
Surgical interventions  performed since the Intracept Procedure  will be captured .   Date , 
type and location  of each intervention will be recorded .  
Interventions will be adjudicated by an independent reviewer.  
8 STUDY RISK ANALYSIS  
This study is categorized as a  non-significant risk study  with minimal risk to subjects.  
The primary  risk to study participants  is a loss of confidentiality .  This risk will be 
mitigated through assignment of the unique Subject ID # and de -identification of data.

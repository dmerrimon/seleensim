Andover, MA  01810  
Phase of development : III 
Objectives:  
The objective of this study is to demonstrate the therapeutic equivalence of two investigational, 
over-the-counter (OTC) redness reliever eye drop formulations to an existing marketed OTC 
redness reliever eye drop in healthy adults with red eye.  
 
Metho dology:  
 
This is a 3 -arm, single center, double -blinded, balanced incomplete randomized block design 
study. Subjects will undergo a 1 -day (3 doses over 9 hours total) intervention period where each 
subject will be randomly assigned to receive 2 of the 3 test products to apply to the left and right 
eyes. For the duration of the study, subjects will be asked to refrain from using all eye treatments, 
including contact lens es. 
 
Eligible subjects will complete 2 clinic visits. All subjects will have an ocular health and vision 
exam for inclusion in the study during clinic Visit 1.  Eligible subjects will have ocular redness 
assessments using a 5 - point redness scale at Baseli ne (pre -treatment prior to 1st product 
application), and then 30 seconds, 60 seconds, and 2 minutes following the  1st product 
application.  Subjects will also complete ocular comfort assessment s for each eye using a scale of 
0 to 10 at Baseline (pre -treatm ent prior to 1st product application) and immediately following the 
Ocular  Redness Assessment completed at 60 seconds after the 1st product application.  The first 
dose will be instilled by trained study staff at the clinic. Subjects will also complete a 
questionnaire at Baseline (pre -treatment prior to 1st product application) and immediately 
following the 2 - minute Ocular  Redness Assessment.  Subjects will be provided product and

initials on any forms, reports, publ ications, or in any other disclosures.  Each subject will be assigned a 
subject ID  number that is used in the Case Report Form (CRF) in lieu of the subject’s name.  In case of 
data transfer, the Sponsor will maintain high standards of confidentiality and p rotection of subject 
personal data.  
The informed consent form must be agreed to by the Sponsor and the IRB /IEC  and must be in 
compliance with current ICH E6, Good Clinical Practices , local regulatory requirements, and legal 
requirements  and be in a languag e that the subject can read and understand.    
The Investigator must ensure that each study subject is fully informed about the nature and objectives of 
the study and possible risks associated with participation.  The Investigator, or a person designated by  
the Investigator, will obtain written informed consent from each subject before any study -specific 
activity is performed.  The informed consent form used in this study, and any changes made during the 
course of the study, must be prospectively approved by  both the IRB and the Sponsor before use.  The 
Investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed consent form.  A copy of the signed and 
dated consent form will be provided to subjects.  
Only subjects who provide informed consent will enter in the study.

 6. INTRODUCTION  
Red eye is a common ophthalmologic condition and can include almost any part of the eye.1 
Conjunctival hyperaemia is caused by vasodilation of the conjunctival blood vessels in response t o 
irritation .  This vasodilation causes the red ap pearance of the normally white appearing sclera, leading to 
the conditio n commonly known as “red eye” . 3   Red eye is treatable with over -the-counte r (OTC) 
medications . 2  
 
Preservatives like benzalkonium chloride ( BAK ) have come under the scrutiny of research studies over 
the years for their po tential to disrupt the protective tear film and ocular surface cells. The medical 
community has deemed that despite its efficient bactericidal qualities, BAK is more cytotoxic in high 
quantities than many other preservatives. In order to provide an alterna tive to BAK, this study will be 
conducted to test the efficacy of two new investigational product s containing,

 8. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
8.1. Overall Study Design  and Plan  
 
This is a 3 -arm, single center, double -blinded, balanced incomplete randomized block design study. 
Subjects will undergo a 1 -day (3 doses over 9 hours total)  intervention period where each subject will  be 
randomly assigned to receive  2 of the 3 test products to apply to the left and right eyes. For the duration 
of the study, subjects will be asked to refrai n from using all eye treatments, including contact lenses.  
 
Eligible subjects will complete 2 clinic visits. All subjects will hav e an ocular health and vision exam for 
inclusion in the study during clinic Visit 1.  Eligible subjects will have ocular redness assessments using 
a 5- point redness scale at Baseline  (pre-treatment prior to 1st product application) , and then 30 seconds, 
60 seconds, and 2 minutes following 1st product application.  Subjects will also complete Ocular 
Comfort Assessment for each eye using a scale  of 0 to 10 at Baseline  (pre-treatment prior to 1st product 
application)  and immediately following the Ocular  Redness Assessment  completed 60 seconds after the 
1st product application.  The first dose will be instilled by trained study staff at the clinic.  Subjects will 
also complete a questionnaire at Base line (pre-treatment prior to 1st product application)  and 
immediately following the 2 - minute  Ocular R edness Assessment.  Subjects will be provided product 
and written and verbal instructions to apply the test product at home.  Subjects will apply test product s at 
home at 4.5  hours ( ± 30 minutes)  and 9 (± 30 minutes) hours after the 1st product application in the 
clinic .  They will also complete a n Ocular  Comfort Assessment and questionnaire at 10 hours (+ 15 
minutes) and 12 hours (+15 minutes) at home.  
 
Subjects will return in approximately 24 ± 1 hour(s) for a final vision exam.   
 
8.2. Criteria  for Subject Termination  
Premature termination of this clinical study may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, 
change in opinion of the IRB/IEC, product safety problems or at the discretion of the Sponsor. In 
addition, the Sponsor retains the right to discontinue the study at any time.

may include, an adverse event, inter -current illness or medical reasons unrelated to the study  
 Nonmedical reasons (e .g., subject request or noncompliance with the treatment procedure as 
determined by the investigator, the Sponsor and/or subject)  
 Pregnancy  
 Serious eligibility or on -study violation of the protocol  
 Administrative or other reasons  
Should a subject decide to withdraw  from the study at any point , all efforts should  be made to complete 
all end of study assessments (if subject cannot come to study site, a telephone call to collect information  
could be performed ).  In case of questions surrounding the circumstances that a subject needs to be 
withdrawn from the study (e .g., protocol deviation), the Sponsor, or the S ponsor representative should 
be consulted .  The reason for withdrawal should be  documented in the subject’s source document and on 
the Subject Disposition EDC page .  
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, three documented attempts will be made  to contact the 
subject via:  
1. Documented phone call (date, time, person completing  the call, result)  
2. Regular mail

 3. Certified letter/return receipt (if service is available)  
The site should request the subject return all used/unused investigational product(s), and follow -up with 
the subject regarding any unresolved adverse events.  
If the  subject withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, 
no further evaluations will be performed and no additional data will be collected. The Sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent.

9.2. Investigational Product  Packaging and Labeling  
All three products  will be identical in color. Test products  will be provided in randomization number  
specific kits . utilizing a one -part label containing the following information:  
 Protocol Number  
 Randomization Number  
 Right Eye or Left Eye  
 Site Identifi cation  
 24-Hour Emergency Phone Number  
 Directions for Use  
 For Investigational Use  
 Warnings  
 Net Contents  
 Expiration  
 Storage Conditions  
Labeling of study supplies will be in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.  All 
investigational, including any commercially available , must be stored in accordance with the 
manufacturers ’ instructio ns. Investigational product supplies must be stored separately . Until dispensed 
to the subjects, the investigational product will be stored in a securely locked area, only accessible to 
authorized personnel.  
9.3. Blinding  and Unblinding  
 
The S ponsor will provi de blinded investigational product. The Investigator/Clinician and the subjects 
will not have access  to the treatment code.  
 
The Investigator/Clinician  will not know which treatment has been administered to subjects. Personnel 
dispensing the test products , collecting  used products  or supervising their use will not participate in the 
examination of subjects in order to minimize potential bias. During supervised use, other staff members 
including the Investigator /Clinician  will not have access to the area wh ere the product is being 
administered.   
 
The randomization scheme will be used by the Clinical and Consumer Packaging Operations 
Department to generate the subject specific single disclosure envelopes. The site clinical study 
coordinator will receive one p ackage containing individual subject specific disclosure envelopes 
indicating treatment decode for each randomization number. Identification of the products assigned to a 
subject may be revealed in the event of a serious adverse event by opening the single  subject specific 
envelope that displays the subject’s randomization number. In such an instance, the Investigator will, if 
circumstances and time permit, contact the Sponsor prior to breaking the code. The date and reason for 

 
COMPANY 
CONFIDENTIAL  
22 of 53 
 CO-161103095739 -VCCT  
Version: Final 28MAR2017  
 such unblinding must be descr ibed on the subject’s source document . Upon completion of the study, all 
subject specific disclosure envelopes must be returned to the study monitor  who will return them to the 
sponsor .  
 
Blinding should only be broken when required and only for the subjec t in question. The Investigator 
must notify the Sponsor, when circumstances and time permit, prior to unblinding of any subject. 
Expectedness of serious and related a dverse events should be assessed using the Safety Attestation letter  
and/or, for marketed products, the locally approved labeling.  
 
If there is a medical emergency and the Investigator deems it necessary to know the subject’s study 
treatment urgently for the subject’s proper medical care, the Investigator may break the treatment code 
immediate ly, and then contact the Study Director or designee as soon as possible afterward. If in the 
opinion of the Investigator it is necessary to break the treatment code and circumstances allow, the 
Investigator will first contact the Study Director or designee  for consultation about breaking the study 
blind.  
9.4. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
 
As the subjects sign a consent form, (s)he will be sequentially issued a subject ID. The subject ID will 
begin with the center ID “ 1001 ” followed by a four - digit unique subject identifier, e.g. “ 10011001 ”. 
Upon qualifying, a unique randomization number will be assigned. This number determines the 
treatment sequence assignment for each subject according to a randomization schedule.  Each subject 
will be randomized to receive 2 of the 3 Investigational Products, one for each eye.  Both products will 
be packaged in individual subject kits.  The product labels will clearly state “LEFT EYE” or “RIGHT 
EYE”.  The randomization will be assi gned sequentially , from 1 -120. Once a randomization number has 
been assigned to a subject, it cannot be reassigned to another subject. The treatment sequence 
assignments of the investigational product and control will be based on a randomization scheme dev ised 
by the Sponsor. The randomization scheme will be used by the Sponsor to generate the randomization -
number -specific single disclosure envelopes.  
9.5. Study Product Storage and Accountability  
The Investigator, or a designated study staff, will ensure that al l investigational product s are stored in a 
secured area  at room temperature and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.   Until 
dispensed, the investigational product will be stored in a securely locked area, accessible only to 
authorized per sonnel.   
The Investigator must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other disposition 
of the investigational product on the Investigational Product Accountability Log supplied by the Sponsor 
or Designee.  The log must identify t he investigational product and account for its disposition on a 
subject -by-subject basis, including specific dates and quantities dispensed and returned.  The log must 
be signed by the individual who dispensed/retrieved the study product, and copies must b e provided to 
the Sponsor at the end of the study for the Trial  Master File.  
At the end of the study, the Study Monitor will conduct the final investigational product accountability. 
All investigational products and study disclosure envelopes must be retur ned to the Sponsor. The 
Sponsor will provide instructions as to return  of any used and unused investigational product.

 9.6. Administration of the Investigational Product  
Subjects will be provided written and oral instructions for their products  by the site .  
9.7. Product Quality Complaints  
 
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC) is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges 
deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability or safety of a product, including its 
labeling, delivery sy stem or packaging integrity.  This does not include effectiveness, preference or 
performance measures, which will be reviewed in aggregate at appropriate intervals.  
 
Any issues with the product discovered during the initial inventory of study supplies shou ld follow the 
instructions provided on the receipt letter; no PQC form should be filed for issues identified when 
opening or unpacking a shipment. Subsequently, any observation of a PQC requires immediate 
notification to the study manager via a completed P QC form and telephone call.  
The PI or designee should complete, sign and forward a copy of the PQC form, via an agreed upon 
secure exchange, to the study manager listed below.  
 
 
 
 
  
In addition, PQC information must be included on the Investigational Product Dispensing and 
Accountability Log or equivalent in the comments field.  The Study Manager listed can assist you or 
answer questions related to this process.  To aid in the initial conversation and understanding of a PQC, 
the site staff may be asked to photograph the issue and send it to the Study Manager.  
When enrolling subjects into this study it is the site’s respons ibility to instruct subjects not to use the 
product if they have a concern related to the product such as an issue with the labeling, investigational 
product or package integrity and to immediately report it using the instruction on the Informed Consent 
or product label.

 11.1.3.  A subject questionnaire will be completed at Baseline  (pre-treatment) , and post -treatment 
after the 2 -minute ocular redness assessment in -clinic, and at home at 10 hours (+15 minutes) 
and 12 hours (+ 15 minutes) after the 1st product application .   
11.2. Ocular  Safety Assessments  
Ocular vision exams will be completed at screening (visual acuity and slip lamp biomicroscopy ) and 
also approximately 24 hours after 1st product application  (visual acuity only) .   
Safety will be monitored and assessed by the collection, evaluation, and analysis of subject reported 
spontaneous adverse events (AEs). If an AE is reported, the subject will be asked to elaborate on the 
nature of the ev ent. The Investigator or designated clinician  will evaluate and record according to the 
Adverse Event Reporting section (Section 12) of the protocol.  
 
Any clinically important abnormalities or causally -related AEs persisting will be followed by the 
Investi gator until resolution or until reaching a clinically stable endpoint. AEs will be reported by the 
subject for the duration of the study, beginning with the signing of the study specific informed consent. 
AEs will be followed by the Investigator as specifi ed in Section 12, Adverse Event Reporting.    
 
A clinically significant visual acuity decrease (defined as an increase of  or greater in logMAR 
score) from baseline (Visit 1) will be considered an Adverse Event. logMAR scores will be recorded in 
the sou rce document.

 12. ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING   
12.1. Introduction  
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group , or suspected causal  relationship to the 
investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following  sections.   For all AEs, the 
Investigator or medically qualified individual (MD/DO/ DMD/DDS ) must pursue and obtain information 
adequate both to  determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for  
classification as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  requiri ng immediate notification (within 24 hours) to  
the Sponsor or its designated representative.   For all AEs, sufficient information  should  be obtained by 
the Investigator or medically qualified individual (MD/DO/  DMD/DDS)  to try to determine causality .  
The Investigator  is required to assess causality.  For AEs with a suspected causal  relationship to the 
investigational product, follow -up by the Investigator or medically qualified individual (MD/DO/  
DMD/DDS)  is required until the  event or its sequelae resolve  or stabilize at a level acceptable to the 
Investigator, and the  Sponsor concurs with that assessment.  
12.2. Reporting Period  
All AEs, whether serious or non -serious, observed and/or spontaneously reported, beginning from the 
time the informed consent is signed and dated, are collected on the source document. AEs of randomized 
subjects will be reported in EDC while screen failure subjects will not.  Informed consent  is considered 
the point at which the subject  is participatin g in the clinical study and all events are captured even if it is  
prior to undergoing any study -related  procedure and/or receiving investigational product  Non-serious 
adverse events will be  reported through the subject’s last study visit (or termination if the subject 
terminates early  from the study for any reason).   Non-serious adverse events are to be reported in the 
source documents and the adverse event  page of the EDC. Details of any signs and symptoms will be 
described and recorded,  including resolution of the adverse event.   
Spontaneous reports of serious AEs will be collected through and including 30 calendar days after 
administration of the subject’s last dose or exposure to investigational product.    
Serious AEs require immediate notification to the Sponsor or its designated  representa tive.  Any SAE  
occurring any time after the reporting period must  be promptly reported if a causal relationship to study 
product is suspected . 
12.3. Definition of an Adverse Event   
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a subject after they have signed an informed 
consent for a trial involving an investigational product.  Any AE that occurs after the informed consent  
has been signed , until first usage of investigational product, will be considered non -treatment emergent 
and cannot (by vi rtue of time of occurrence) have a causal relationship with the investigational product.    
The event does not need to have a suspected causal relationship  with th e investigational product or 
device .  Therefore, a n AE can be any unfavorable and  unintended s ign, symptom, disease or injury 
temporally associated with the use of a n investigational  product whether or not related to the 
investigational  product .  Examples of  adverse events include but are not limited to:  
 Abnormal test findings,   
 Clinically importan t symptoms and signs,   

 
COMPANY 
CONFIDENTIAL  
31 of 53 
 CO-161103095739 -VCCT  
Version: Final 28MAR2017  
  Changes in physical examination findings,  
 Hypersensitivity, and   
 Progression/worsening of underlying disease.   
Additionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:  
 Overdose,   
 Withdrawal,   
 Abuse,   
 Drug misuse,   
 Drug interactions,  
 Medication errors,   
 Product dependency,  
 Exposure in utero , and 
 Study related procedure.  
12.4. Abnormal Test Findings  
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as  an adverse 
event are as follows:  
 Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
 Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention,  and/or  
 Test result leads to a discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant  
treatment, or other therapy, and/or   
 Test result is considered to be an adverse event by the Investigator or the Sponsor.  
Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an 
adverse event.  Any abnormal test result th at is determined to be an error does not require  reporting as an 
adverse event.  
12.5. Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  for Drug s  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” for a drug study if, in the view of either the  
Investigator (MD/DO/ DMD/DDS)  or the Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:   
 Results in death,  
 Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death),  
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
 Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to  
conduct normal life functions,   

 
COMPANY 
CONFIDENTIAL  
32 of 53 
 CO-161103095739 -VCCT  
Version: Final 28MAR2017  
  Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect,   
 Is considered medically significant (medical and scientific judgment should be  exercised in 
deciding whether expedited reporting is app ropriate in other situations,  such as important 
medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening or  require hospitalization but 
may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when,  based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the other outcomes  listed above).   Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm  requiring intensive treatment in an Emergency Room or at home, 
blood dyscrasia, or  convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug 
dependency or  drug abuse, or malignancy), or,  
 Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medical product (medically  
significant)  and should be reported a s an SAE in the category  ‘Other medically important 
condition s.’ 
12.6. Hospitalization  
Adverse events reported from clinical studies associated with hospitalization or prolonging  
hospitalization are considered serious.  Any initial admission (even if less than 2 4 hours) to a  healthcare 
facility meets these criteria.   Admission also includes transfer within the hospital to  an acute/intensive 
care unit (e.g., from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor to  a coronary care unit, 
neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit).   Hospitalization does not include the following:   
 Rehabilitation facilities,  
 Hospice facilities,  
 Respite care (e.g., caregiver relief),  
 Skilled nursing facilities,  
 Nursing homes,  
 Emergency room visits (unless the reason for the e mergency room visit meets one of the 
other outcomes in the definition of serious), and/or  
 Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures)  
 Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical 
AE is not in itself a SAE.  Examples include:  
 Admission for treatment of a pre -existing condition not associated with the development of a 
new AE or with a worsening of the pre -existing condition (e.g., for work -up of persistent pre -
treatment lab abnormality ),  
 Social admission (e.g., subject has no place to sleep),  
 Administrative admission (e.g., for yearly physical exam),  
 Protocol -specified admission during a clinical study (e.g., for a procedure required by the 
study protocol),  

 
COMPANY 
CONFIDENTIAL  
33 of 53 
 CO-161103095739 -VCCT  
Version: Final 28MAR2017  
  Optional admission not as sociated with a precipitating clinical AE (e.g.,  or elective cosmetic 
surgery),  
Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline source documentation for 
the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject.   
 Diagnostic and t herapeutic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not  
be reported as AEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was  performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an  acute appendicit is 
that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as  the AE and the resulting 
appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the  AE. 
12.7. Resolution  
The Investigator will be required to assess the outcome of the AE for investigational product  as one of 
the following:   
 Resolved,   
 Not Resolved,  
 Fatal,  
 Resolved with sequelae,   
 Resolving, or  
 Unknown.  
Any causally -related AEs unresolved upon completion of the last study visit will be  followed up by the 
study staff until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level  acceptable to the Investigator and 
recorded in the EDC system .  An event that is assessed as resolved with sequelae or resolving indicates 
that the subject has  stabilized to a level acceptable to the Investigator and has con currence by the 
Sponsor.  
12.8. Severity Assessment  
The severity of AEs from investigational product will be assessed by the Investigator or medically 
qualified individual (MD/DO/ DMD/DDS) using the following  general categorical descriptors:   
MILD : Awareness of s ymptoms that are easily tolerated, causing minimal  discomfort and not 
interfering with subject's usual function or normal  everyday activities  
MODERATE : Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference to some extent with  subject's 
usual function or n ormal everyday activity    
SEVERE :  Extreme distress, causing significant impairment of functioning or  incapacitation; 
interferes significantly with subject's usual function; prevents  normal everyday 
activities  
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe  event is not 
necessarily a serious event.  For example, a headache may be severe (interferes  significantly with 
subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serio us unless it met  one of the criteria for SAE s, 
listed above.

 12.9. Causality Assessment  
 The Investigator’s or medically qualified individual  (MD/DO/ DMD/DDS) assessment of 
causality for investigational product (i.e., relationship to investigational product) must  be 
provided for all AEs (serious and nonserious).   An Investigator’s causality  assessment is the 
determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the  investigational product 
caused or contributed to an AE.  
 Not Related - An AE that is n ot related to the use of the drug   
 Doubtful - An AE for which an alternative explanation is more likely, e.g.,  concomitant 
drug(s), concomitant disease(s), or the relationship in time suggests that a  causal 
relationship to investigational product is unlikely.   
 Possible - An AE that might be due to the use of the drug.   An alternative  explanation, e.g., 
concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive.  The relationship in time is 
reasonable; therefore, the causal relationship to investigat ional product cannot be excluded.   
 Probable - An AE that might be due to the use of the drug.   The relationship  in time is 
suggestive (e.g., confirmed by dechallenge) and an alternative explanation is  less likely, 
e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant dis ease(s).   
 Very Likely - An AE that is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot  be reasonably 
explained by an alternative explanation, e.g., concomitant drug(s),  concomitant disease(s).   
The relationship in time is very suggestive (e.g.,  it is confi rmed by dechallenge and 
rechallenge) for a causal relationship to th e drug . 
If the Investigator determines a SAE  is associated with study procedures, the  Investigator must record 
this suspected causal relationship in the source documents and in the EDC system , as appropriate, and 
report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE  reporting requirements, if applicable.  
12.9.1.  Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events  
When a subject withdraws due to a SAE , the SAEs  must be  reported in accordance with the reporting 
requi rements defined below.  
12.9.2.  Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
The Investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the study 
subject.  In addition, each study subject will be questioned  about AEs.  
12.9.3.  Reporting Requiremen ts 
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for a SAE .  If a SAE occurs, expedited 
reporting will follow local and international  regulations, as appropriate.   
For randomized subjects, a ll AEs will be reported on the AE source document page and then will be 
entered in EDC. A Clinical  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form must also be completed if the 
event is considered  to be serious.  It should be noted that this Clinical SAE Report Form for collection of 
SAE informati on is not the same as the AE EDC page .  Where the same data are  collected, the forms 
must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE term should be used on both

Version: Final 28MAR2017  
 forms.  Adverse events should be reported using concise  medical terminology  in the EDC system  as well 
as on the form for collection of SAE information.  
12.9.3.1.  Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
If a SAE  occurs, the Sponsor is to be initially notified by telephone  immediately upon awareness of the 
event by the Investigator’s si te.  Within 24 hours of the  Investigator site’s awareness of the event, the 
study site must send the Sponsor the Clinical  SAE Report Form  (via a secure e -mail) .  This timeframe 
also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on  previously forwarded SAE  reports as well as 
to the initial and follow -up reporting of EIU cases.   In the rare event that the Investigator’s site does not 
become aware of the occurrence of a  SAE  immediately (e.g., if an outpatient study subject initially seeks 
treatment  elsewhe re), the Investigator’s site is to report the event immediately after learning of it as  
described and document the time of the study site’s first awareness of the AE.   
For all SAE s, the Investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information  to the Sp onsor in 
accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.   In addition,  an Investigator may be 
requested by the Sponsor to obtain specific additional follow -up information in an expedited fashion.  
This information may be more detailed than th at captured  on the AE case report form.   In general, this 
will include a description of the adverse  event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical 
assessment of the case and  independent determination of possible causality.   Information on other  
possible causes of the  event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses must be provided. In the 
case of a  subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings (if available) and death certificate  
should be collected if permission is obtained from t he subject’s family.  For a hospitalization, a  copy of 
the hospital discharge summary should be requested. If obtained, these documents  (with subject’s 
personal identifiers redacted) should be submitted as soon as possible to the  Sponsor or its designated 
representative.   
Appropriate SAE forms will be provided to the study site at the initiation of the study .  Upon  
notification of an SAE at the study site, the Investigator or designated study site staff should  call and 
speak to their Sponsor’s study team co ntact immediately to initially notify them of the  SAE.    
Within 24 hours of awareness of the event, the Investigator or designated study site staff : 
 Complete the Clinical SAE Report Form [ that has been provided to you by the Sponsor  or 
their designee ] with  as much  information as possible, however at a minimum, the subject 
identification number,  name of product, SAE, and name of reporter are required);    
 Ensures the Investigator signs the Clinical SAE Report Form prior to sending to the  
Sponsor;   
 Scans and send via secure email the Clinical SAE Report Form and any supportive 
documentation to the Sponsor contacts.    
 The Sponsor contact information:

12.10.  Special Situations  
Special Situations (SS): Safety events that may not meet the  definition of  an AE; however, are required 
to be collected to meet Health  Authority requirements. Examples include:  
 Overdose of a J&J medicinal product.  
 Pregnancy exposure (maternal and paternal) to a J&J medicinal  product or medical 
device.  
 Exposure to a  J&J product from breastfeeding.  
 Suspected abuse/misuse of a J&J medicinal product or medical device.  
 Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a J&J medicinal product or  medical device 
(including occupational exposure).  
 Any failure of expected pharmacological  or medical device action (i.e. , lack of effect) of 
a J&J product.  
 Unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from use of a J&J product.  
 Medication error involving a J&J medicinal product or medical device  with or without 
patient/consumer exposure to the J&J product, (e.g. , product name confusion) OR that caused 
an unintended effect or could  cause an intended effect (e.g. adult medicine given to a young 
child).  
 Suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a J&J product.  
 Off-label use.   Note: Off -label  use of a product without an associated AE should be collected 
only when it is specifically and voluntarily brought to the attention of the company in an 
unsolicited manner by a reporter ( e.g., Patient or HCP), or data obtained from databases 
where off -label use may be systematically collected (e.g., reimbursement database in US), 
and in accordance with local procedure in compliance with local laws and regulations.

 12.11.  Exposure In Utero  
For investigational products within clinical studies and for marketed products, an exposure in utero  EIU 
occurs if:   
1. A woman is exposed to the investigational product at any time between her last menses prior to 
conception through the delivery of the baby.   
2. There is a possibility of intrauterine exposure to drug via semen from the male partner who is 
taking the investigational product at the time of conception, thereby possibly exposing the fetus 
to the product.  
If any study subject or study subject’s part ner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the  study 
subject’s participation, the Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor on a  Pregnancy 
Notification Form (to be provided by the Sponsor when applicable) .  In addition, the Investigator must  
submit information regarding  environmental exposure to a Sponsor product in a pregnant woman (e.g., a 
nurse reports that  she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) 
using  the Pregnancy  Notification Form.  This mu st be done irrespective of whether an adverse  event has 
occurred and notification must occur within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy.   Initial notification 
via telephone to the Sponsor’s study team contact must occur immediately  upon the Investigator  site’s 
awareness of the pregnancy.   The Pregnancy Notification Form must then be sent to the Sponsor within 
24 hours of the si te’s awareness.  The information submitted should include the anticipated date of 
delivery (see below for  information related to induced termination of pregnancy).   
Follow -up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information on all EIU reports.  The Investigator 
will follow the pregnancy until completion or until pregnancy termination  (i.e., induced abortion) and 
then notify the Sponsor of the outcome.  The Investigator will  provide this information as a follow -up to 
the initial Drug Exposure During Pregnancy  Collection Form A and/or End of Pregnancy Collection 
Form B (provided by the Sponsor  when applicable).   The reason(s) for an induced abortion should be 
specified.  An EIU report is  not created when an ectopic pregnancy report is received since this 
pregnancy is not usually  viable.  Rather, a SAE  case is created with the event of ectopic pregnancy.    
The Inv estigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAE s if the  outcome of the pregnancy meets 
the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE (i.e., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or 
congenital anomaly [including  that in an aborted fetus, stillbirth, or neonatal death]).  In the case of a 
live birth, the  “normality” of the newborn can be assessed at the time of birth (i.e., no minimum follow -
up period of a presumably normal infant is required before an End of Pregnancy Collection For m B can 
be completed).  The “normality” of an aborted fetus can be assessed by gross visual  inspection, unless 
pre-abortion test findings are suggestive of a congenital anomaly.    
Additional pregnancy outcomes that are classified as SAE s and should be  reported as such include:   
 “Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion.  
 All neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth, without regard to causality.  
 Any infant death after 1 month that the Investigator assesses as possibly related to in utero  
exposure to the investigational product.

 14. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOU RCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
The in vestigator(s)/institution(s) will permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review and 
regulatory inspection(s) by providing direct access to source data/documents.  
14.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a subject  into the study,  a representative of Johnson & Johnson 
will visit the investigational study site to:  
 Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
 Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities the site's 
responsibility with regard to protocol adhe rence  as well as the study and monitoring 
responsibilities of Johnson & Johnson  or its representatives.  Th ese responsibilities will be 
documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between Johnson & Johnson and the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor fro m Johnson & Johnson  or representative will have regular contacts with 
the investigational site, for the following:  
 Provide information and support to the investigator(s)  
 Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
 Confirm that the investigational team is adh ering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the  source documents and  case report forms, and that investigational 
product accountability checks are being performed  
 Perform source data verification.  This includes a comparison of the da ta in the case report 
forms with the subject ’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records 
relevant to the study.  This will require direct access to all original records for each subject  
(e.g., clinic charts).  
 Record and report all protocol deviations not previously sent to Johnson & Johnson . 
 Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented in the EDC system  and confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to Johnson & Johnson  and those SAEs that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs information or 
study -related direction . 
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of Johnson & Johnson , a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics 
Committee or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, 
including source data verification.  The purpose of a  Johnson & Johnson audit or inspection is to 
systematically  and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to determine 
whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported 
according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the Intern ational Conference on 
Harmonization, and any applicable regulatory requirements.  The investigator should contact their study 
contacts  immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency about an  inspection.

 16. DATA HANDLING AND RE CORDKEEPING  
16.1. Case Report Forms / Electronic Data Capture  
As used in this protocol, the ter m case report form (CRF) should be understood to refer to  the Electronic 
Data Capture system.  
All data will be collected on source documents first and then recorded in the Electronic Data Capture 
(EDC ) system .   
The EDC system , is the database where pertinent study data is collected such as demography, subject 
randomization, ocular assessments , adverse events, and subject disposition.  
Electronic Data Capture pages should be completed for each randomized  subject.  The completed pages 
of the EDC system are the sole property of the Sponsor and should not be  made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of the  Sponsor or appropriate regulatory authorities, 
without written permission from the Spon sor. 
It is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure completion and to review and approve all  information 
captured in the EDC. The subject’s data in the EDC system must be  electronically signed by the 
Investigator. These signatures serve to attest that t he information  contained in the EDC system is true. 
At all times, the Investigator has final personal  responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all 
clinical data entered in  the EDC. Subject source documents are the Investigator's subject records  
maintained at the study site. In cases where the source documents are the hospital or the  physician's 
chart, the information collected in the EDC must match those charts.  
All final data recorded in EDC system will be kept by the Sponsor and at the clinical  site.   
All data recorded on source documents will be kept at the clinical site.  
16.2. Inspection of Records  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the Sponsor, the investigator agrees to 
keep records including the identity of all pa rticipating subjects (sufficient information to link records, 
e.g., CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent forms, copies of all CRFs, SAE  
forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition.  The records should be retained 
by the investigator according to ICH guidelines, local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study 
Agreement, whichever is longer . 
16.3. Retention of Records  
The Principal Investigator must maintain all documentation relating to the study for a period of 2 years 
after the last marketing application approval, or if not approved 2 years following the discontinuance of 
the test article for investigation.  If it becomes necessary for Johnson  & Johnson or the Regulatory 
Authority to review any docum entation relating to the study, the Investigator must permit access to such 
records.  
If the investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the study, the Sponsor should be 
prospectively notified.  The study records must be transferred to  an acceptable designee, such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to the Sponsor.  The investigator must obtain Sponsor's written 
permission before disposing of any records, even if retention requirements have been met .

Premature termination of this clinical study may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, 
change in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of the sponsor.  In addition, 
the sponsor retains the right to discont inue development of this  investigational compound at any time.  
If a study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, the Sponsor will promptly notify the Investigator.  
After notification, the investigator must contact all participating subjects within 2 weeks.   All study 
materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.

Primary Objectives  
 
-To assess the effect of broadband light with skin tightening properties on the 
gene expression pattern of aging skin  
 
-To assess the duration of the skin rejuvenation effects of broadband light with 
skin tightening properties (optional)  
 
Background  
 
 Studies in model organisms suggest that aged cells can be functionally 
rejuvenated, but whether this  concept applies to human skin is unclear. Recently, 
we applied  3'-end sequencing for expression quantification ("3 -seq") to discover 
the gene expression program associated with human photoaging  and intrinsic 
skin aging (collectively termed "skin aging"), and the impact of broadband light 
(BBL) treatment. We found significant changes in  2,265 coding and noncoding 
RNAs, of which 1,293 that became “rejuvenated” after BBL treatment, whereby 
they bec ame more similar to their expression level in youthful skin. Rejuvenated 
genes (RGs) included several known key regulators of organismal longevity and 
their proximal long noncoding RNAs. Hence, BBL treatment can restore gene 
expression pattern of photo -aged and intrinsically aged human skin to resemble 
young skin.  
 However, the duration of these effects and the potential to augment these 
effects through increases in particular wavelengths of light have not been 
explored.  The Sciton SkinTyte (800 -1800nm) is  the ideal technology to examine 
these questions, since this device has been used in the clinical setting to reduce 
cheek and submental laxity  (Gold, 2010) . It incorporates the broadband light 
technology with an emphasis on 590 nm filter to achieve these c linical results.   
 
Study Procedures  
 
The design of this study is a prospective, single blind study of six adult 
volunteers.  
Human subjects and sample acquisition  
This study will be  conducted in accord with Declaration of Helsinki 
principles. After Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent i s 
obtained, six female  participants over the age of 55  years will undergo BBLST 
treatments to the left forearm. Inclusion criteria  included Fitzpatrick skin type II or 
III, and a global assessment of forearm skin aging consistent with moderate or 
severe forearm skin aging (modified validated instrument from McKenzie et al.,  
2011) for treated participants. T reatments will be  performed  on the Sciton Jou le 
Platform using BBL in Skintyte mode with 590ST filter. On a separate part of the 
arm that is clearly marked, Skintyte alone will be applied. Untreated areas will 
also be marked. All markings will be photographed. The same investigator will 
perform  the treatments at 4 -week intervals for a total of 3 treatments .  At each 
treatment session, two or more passes were performed. Four weeks after the 
third BBL treatment, 4 mm skin biopsies will performed by Keys punch technique 
from the BBLST treated , ST treated  and adjacent untreated skin. These 
specimens will be  bisected and placed into either RNAlater (Ambion Cat# 
AM7022) or formalin solution for with H&E, von Giesen or PAS staining.  
Inclusion criteria  
1. Female  
2. Age 5 5 years or older  (total 6 )  
3. Fitzpatrick skin type 2 -3 
4. Photo -aging at least moderate on the exten sor forearms  
 
Exclusion criteria  
 
1. Unable to understand and sign informed consent form  
2. Unable to comply with study procedures  
3. Pregnant or lactating  
4. Prior treatment to forearms including topical retinoid, laser treatment, 
photodynamic treatment, prescription topical agents x 1 month  
5. Active skin conditions that precluding treatment including zoster, blistering 
skin disease, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, abnormal scarring, skin cancer 
in the  area of study treatment  
6. Currently on hormone based therapy  (both systemic and topical)  
 
 
Screening visit  
 
After written informed co nsent signing, subjects will undergo the following 
procedures, eligibility will be assessed and the following will be obtained:  
 
 Demographics  
 Medical Histories  
 Physical Examination  
 Photographs with high resolution digital camera  
 Cutometry  
 
Baseline (visit 1, treatment # 1), Day 28 visit (treatment #2) , Day 56 visit 
(treatment #3)  
 
Each subject would have three tr eatments at one month intervals by the same 
health care provider. Each subject would have three biopsies at approximately 
one month post treatment (day 84 visit) . The biopsies will be of the BBL treated, 
the BBL -ST treated and the untreated. Total biopsy p er pati ent at the end of the 
study is 3 . 
 
 
 
Clinical characteristics  
Mean ages, skin type and medical histories will be described. The mean elasticity 
and transepidermal water loss will be described for treated  (day 84 and possibly 
168), untreated  (day 84 or day 168  (if we go with the latter budget scenario) ). 
The degree of fine wrinkling, sagging, texture, erythema and overall appearance 
will be assessed using a 5 -point Likert scale and compared for treated, untreated 
and young skin. T -tests will be  used to assess the mean, standard deviations and 
p values at a significance level <0.05 as described in Chang et al.,  2013.  
 
3-Seq and bioinformatics  
Total RNA will be  extracted using RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit 
(Qiagen). 3 -seq will be  performed as des cribed in Beck AH et al., 2010. In brief, 
oligo -dT-directed reverse transcription generated cDNAs corresponding to 3' 
ends of poly -adenylated transcripts; the cDNAs were cloned and subjected to 
deep sequencing on the Illumina GAIIx platform with raw read l ength 36bp. Raw 
reads were aligned to human genome (hg18) using bowtie (Langmead et al., 
2009); each sample generated 6.5 -12.4 million uniquely mappable reads. 3’ 
sequencing of skin transcripts was performed to assess length distributions.  
Reads Per Kilob ase of exon per Million mappable reads (RPKM, a direct 
measure of transcript abundance) and the number of raw re ads falling on to each 
gene will be  calculated using self -developed script by K. Qu.  RefSeq 
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq ) and Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org) 
annotated noncoding genes were included. Significant genes will be  called using 
DESeq package (http://www.bioconductor.org  ) comparing aged -treated versus 
aged -untreated samples (genes chan ged due to treatment), and aged -untreated 

versus young -untreated (genes changed due to aging). Unsupervised 
hierarchical clustering of significant ly different expressed genes will be  performed 
using Cluster. Treated versus untreated skin across the time points of Study Day 
28 and Day 56 will analyzed. The young group will serve as the comparison 
group. 3’ -seq technique will allow for analysis of long non -coding RNAs.  
Gene Otology terms were generated using DAVID Bioinformatics 
Resources 6.7 (http://david. abcc.ncifcrf.gov/). Genes close to lncGenes will  
identified using GREAT database ( http://great.stanford.edu ).  This data will be 
deposited into the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).  
RT-qPCR  
Total RNA will be  extracte d with TRIzol (Invitrogen) followed by RNeasy 
column purification (Qiagen) and DNAse Turbo Treatment (Ambion). RT -qPCR 
was performed using total RNA (10 ng), Taqman One Step RT -PCR master mix, 
and one of the following Taqman assays: GAPDH ( Hs99999905_m1 ) and 
ZMPSTE24 (Hs00956778_m1) (App lied Biosystems). Reactions will be  in 
triplicate for each sample and performed a minimum of two times. Data will be 
normalized to GAPDH levels.

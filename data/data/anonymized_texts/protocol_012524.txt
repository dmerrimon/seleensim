Title of Study: A 24 -Week Double-blind, Safet y, Efficacy , and Pharmacody namic Study  
Investigating Two Doses of Teduglutide in Pediatric Subjects Aged 1 Year Through 17 Years 
With Short Bowel Sy ndrome who are Dependent on Parenteral Support
Protocol No: TED -C14-
006
Phase of development: 3
Objectives: The objective of this clinical study  is to evaluate the safet y, tolerability, efficacy, 
and pharmacod ynamic effect s of teduglutide in pediatric subjects ( aged 1 year through 17 years) 
with short bowel sy ndrome (SBS) who are dependent on parenteral support .
Methodology: This will be a double- blind, 2 arm study  in which subjects will be randomized in 
a 1:1 ratio to receive 
either 0.025 mg/kg/day  or 0.05 mg/kg/day  of teduglutide for 24 weeks.  
Dosing regimens will be blinded to both investigators and subjects.  In addition, an attempt will 
be made to enroll subjects in a separate standard ofcare cohort , which will serve as an 
observational cohort for the 24-week treatment period. The subjects in the standard of care 
cohort w ill follow the same visit schedule as the randomized subjects.
All subjects will be screened for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to start of treatment to verify  the 
requirements for nutritional support for each subject and to ensure adhere nce to eligibility  
parameters. After screening, t he 24-week treatment period will consist of site visits at baseline, 
weekl y for the first 2 weeks, and then every other week for the next 8 weeks (through Week 12).  
From Weeks 13 to 24, visits at the sites will be conducted at Weeks 15, 18, 21, and 24.  
Telephone contacts will be made on all other weeks during the treatment period.  A final visit 
will be scheduled at Week 28, 4 weeks following the end of treatment (EOT) .  Telephone contact 
will be made during the interim weeks f rom EOT to end of study  (EOS).
To maintain consistency  across all centers, sites and subjects (treated and standard of care) must 
follow the nutritional support adjustment guidelines (developed with SBS expert input and 
provided in the protocol) for decisi ons regarding parenteral nutrition/intravenous 
(PN/IV )
support reduction and advances in enteral feeds based on weight gain, urine, and stool output in 
the setting of clinical stability .
Number of Subjects:  Approximately  20 teduglutide -naïve 
subjects ( at least 10 subjects per 
treatment arm ) will be enrolled at approximately  10 to 20investigational sites globall y.

Final v1.0
12 March 2015In addition, attempts will be made to enroll up to 8 teduglutide -naïve subjec ts in a standard of 
care cohort (who will not be treated with tedug lutide )to serve as an observational cohort.
Duration of Study:  There will be, at a minimum, a 2 -week screening period followed by  
24weeks of on -treatment study  visits. There will be one final scheduled visit at Week 28, 
4weeks after the EOT (Week 24).   
The proposed duration of the clinical phase is from July  2015 through December 2016.  The start 
of the clinical phase is defined as first subject screened.  The end of the clinical phase is defined 
as the last visit of the last subject.

12 March 2015Reference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration:
Not applicable.
Criteria f or Evaluation:
Safety and t olerability :
Safety  and tolerability  will be assessed b y evaluation of:
Adverse events, including GI sy mptoms
Physical examinations
Vital signs, including body  weight , heart rate, and blood pressure
Electrocardiograms
Laboratory  safet y data, including electrol yte balance and glucose
Antibodies to teduglutide.  Samples for antibody  analy sis will be drawn at baseline and at the 
EOT (Week 24) and EOS (Week 28) visits prior to the adminis tration of teduglutide and at 
least 14 hours after the previous dose.  One sample will be collected at the final visit 4 weeks 
after the EOT (EOS, Week 28).  An y subjects testing positive for antibodies specific to 
teduglutide (positive/specific antibodies) at Week 28 will have follow -up visits 3 and/or 
6months after the last dose of study  drug to assess antibody  status.
Maintaining weight, head circumference, and length trends on growth charts
Changes in o ral/enteral f eeding 
Nutritional i ntake and 
urinary /fecal o utput (where collection is possible)
GI-specific testing including imaging (eg, colon oscopy , sigmoidoscopy ) abdominal 
ultrasound, fecal occult blood testing upper GI series with small bowel follow -through
Pharmacodynamics:
The primary  pharmacod ynamic (PD) parameter is parenteral support reduction of 20% to 100% 
at 24 weeks (or EOT) compare d to baseline.
Analy sis of additional PD endpoints will include:
100% reduction in PN/IV volume support (an y subjects who are able to completely  wean off
PN/I V support ) compared to baseline at EOS
A decrease in parenteral support (calories and volume)
An increase in enteral nutritional tolerance (calories and volume)
Change from baseline in PN/I V support, citrulline, and enteral support at Week 24 (or EOT)
Pediatric Study TED -C14 -006
Teduglutide (rDNA origin) for subcutaneous injection

Final v1.0
12 March 2015Change from baseline in PN/I V support, citrulline, and enteral support at Week 28 (or EOS)
Change from baseline in PN/I V support, citrulline, and enteral support at Week 24 (or EOT) 
compared to Week 28 (or EOS)
Change in u rine output (collected or calculated volume)
Change in weight, height (length), and head circumference (where appropriate)
Change in PN/IV support 3 and 6 months after EOT compared to baseline for those subjects 
who developed antibodies specific to teduglutide
Change in hours per day  or day s per week of PN/IV support.
Intensit y of  response (PN/IV reduction and advance in enteral suppo rt) at each visit.
Proportion of responders (ie, subjects who achieve at least a 20% reduction in parenteral 
support) at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks.
To maintain consistency  across all centers, sites and subjects (treated and standard of care) must 
follow the nutritional support adjustment guidelines (developed with SBS expert input) for 
decisions regarding PN/IV support reduction and advances in enteral feeds based on weight gain, 
urine, and stool output in the setting of clinical stability .
Safety and tolerability  will be evaluated b y a data safety monitoring board (DSMB) every  
3months during the active study  period.  The DSMB review will include all cumulative safet y 
data ( ie, adverse events, laboratory  assessments, phy sical examinations , etc.
)from study  
assessments through each cutoff period including any  reasons for dose adjustment and 
discontinuations.
Statistical methods:
Due to the limited size of the study  population descriptive statistics will be used with a goal of 
summarizing the sampl e
. As such, no claims of significance will be made for an y of the data.
Continuous variables, including those assessed on a discrete scale, will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics including number of subjects, mean, median, standard d eviation, maximum, 
and minimum. For categorical variables, statistical summaries will include number of subjects 
and percentages.
Demographics and baseline:
Summary  statistics will be presented for demographic and baseline variables.  Analy sis of 
variance computations will be applied as appropriate.

12 March 2015Efficacy/Pharmacodynamics:
Efficacy /pharmacody namics data including reduction in parenteral support, increase in enteral   
nutritional tolerance, change in PN/IV support, citrulline, enteral support, urine outpu t, weight,
height, hours per day  or day s per week of PN/IV support, and time to PN/IV reduction and 
advance in enteral support will be summarized by visit and time point.
Safety:
Safety  data including clinical laboratory  tests, phy sical examinations, conco mitant medications, 
electrocardiogram monitoring, and vital signs assessments will be summarized by  visit and time 
point.  Adverse events will also be collected and summarized, including Grade 3 and 4 adverse 
events of special interest, based on Common Ter minology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
criteria.  Descriptive statistics will be calculated for quantitative safet y data as well as for the 
difference from baseline, if applicable.  Frequency counts will be compiled for classification of 
qualitative safet y data.

12 March 20151 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
Compound
Teduglutide isa novel, recombinant analog of naturally  occurring human glucagon- like 
peptide- 2 (GLP -2)that regulates the functional and structural integrit y of the cells lining the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract.  Teduglutide is a 33 -amino acid peptide that differs from native 
GLP-2 in the substitution of gl ycine for alanine at the second position at the N -terminus.  As a 
result, teduglutide demonstrates resistance to degradation by dipeptidy l peptidase 4 and 
therefore maintains a longer elimination half
-life (t1/2)of approximately  2hours compared to 
the native peptide, which has a t 1/2 of approximately 7 minutes.  Teduglutide has been shown in 
animal studies and previous human clinical trials to increase villus height and cry pt depth in 
the intestinal epithelium, thereb y increasing the absorptive surface area of the intestines.  The 
Euro pean Commission granted a centralised marketing authorization valid throughout the 
European Union for teduglutide (Revestive™) on 30 August 2012 and a New Drug Application 
(NDA) for teduglutide (Gattex®) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA ) on 21 December 2012 for the treatment of adult patients with Short Bowel S yndrome 
(SBS) who are dependent on parenteral support.
Subsequent supplemental submissions in the US and EU in 2013 and 2014 provided long -term 
data from the completed long-term safet y and efficacy  study in support of subsequent changes 
to the label which provide for long -term use of Gattex.
Preclinical Studies
A comprehensive preclinical evaluation of the toxicological profile of teduglutide has been 
conducted (acute an d repeat dose toxicology , safety  pharmacology , genetic and reproductive 
toxicology , juvenile animal studies, carcinogenicity , and special studies). Subcutaneous 
injections of teduglutide have been shown to be well tolerated at acute doses as high as 
200mg/kg/day  (mouse) or repeated doses of up to 50 mg/kg/day  for 6 months in mice and 
25mg/kg/day  for 12 months in Cy nomolgus monkey s. At dose levels of teduglutide up to 
50mg/kg/day , there were no adverse effects on in utero fetal development in rats and rab bits or 
on reproductive parameters (viability , growth, mating) or fertility  in the offspring of treated 
rats. Toxicity  studies in juvenile animals have been completed using mini -pigs. A No Observed 
Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of teduglutide in juvenile mini- pigs treated subcutaneousl y 
twice dail y for 14 day s was found to be 25 mg/kg/day . In a 90- day toxicology  study  in juvenile 
mini-pigs, the changes observed in the gastrointestinal tract were consistent with those 
observed in studies conducted using adult animals (rodents and primates). No treatment -related 
malignant tumors were noted in a 2 -year carcinogenicity stud y in rats; treatment -related 
changes included benign tumors of the bile duct epithelium and adenomas of the jejunal 
mucosa in males treated at 35 mg/kg/day . The results from a second 2- year carcinogenicity

12 March 2015study  in Crl:CD1(I CR) mice were provided to the agency  in a NDA Supplement which 
received agency  approval on 26 June 2014. Subcutaneous doses of 1, 3.5 and 12.5 mg/kg/day  
(about 20, 70, and 250 times the recommended daily  human dose of 0.05 mg/kg, respectivel y) 
were studied and adenocarcinoma in the jejunum was present in males given a dose of 
12.5 mg/kg/day .
Clinical Studies
Two completed studies (CL 0600- 004 and CL 0600 -005) evaluated safet y and tolerability of 
daily  teduglutide dosing for up to 12 months in SBS subjects who were dependent on 
parenteral nut rition/intravenous fluids (PN/I V).  Study CL0600-004, a double -blind , placebo -
controlled study   in which 83 subjects were enrolled and 67 dosed with teduglutide, assessed 
the effects of teduglutide (0.05 and 0.10 mg/kg/day ) on reductions in PN/ IV.  
There was a 
statistically  significant difference favoring the 0.05 mg/kg/day  group over placebo (p=0.007) 
by using a graded response at the end of the study .  The reduction of PN/I V volume was 
similar in the 2 active groups (2.5 L each). The extension study , CL0600- 005, assessed the 
long-term safety of teduglutide and the proportion of responders in the CL 0600 -004 study  that 
maintained their resp onse at the end of a further 28 weeks of t reatment .  The extension study  
also assessed the effects of teduglutide at 28 weeks on those subjects previously  receiving 
placebo in Study  CL0600 -004.
Results from the extension study  supported the clinical benefits of the0.05 mg/kg/day dose, 
teduglutide treatment
in the initial phase 3 study , which included significant reducti ons in 
PN/I V.  There was 75% of the subjects who previously  responded to t eduglutide treatment in 
Study  CL0600 -004 who maintained this response or experienced further improved benefit 
from teduglutide treatment.  More than 60% of the subjects previousl y receiving placebo in 
Study  CL0600 -004 achieved a clinical response after swi tching to teduglutide 
treatment for 
6months. The majority  of adverse events (AEs) reflected the underl ying disease and were not 
treatment -related.
Study  CL0600 -020 was a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study  in which 
subjects were randomized to either teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg/day  or placebo on a 1:1 ratio.  
The 
first s tage of the stud y included a screening andoptimization period and a stabilization period 
that demonstrated stable administration of PN/I V volume for a minimum of 4 weeks up to a 
maximum of 8 weeks.  The second s tage was a dosing period of 24 weeks.  Subjects on 
0.05 mg/kg/day  teduglutide achieved a higher responder rate (defined as a 20% to 100% 
reduction from baseline in PN/I Vvolume at Weeks 20 and 24) than the placebo -treated 
subjects (27/43 subjects, 62.8% and 13/43 subjects, 30.2%, respectively ).  This difference was 
clinically  and statistically significant in both the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) (p = 0.002) and Per 
Protocol  (p <0.001) populations.  Genera lly, the incidence of treatment -emergent AEs 
(TEAEs) were distributed similarly  across all treatment groups.  The TEAEs with a higher 
incidence in the teduglutide group were mainl y of GI origin.  A long
-term, open- label

12 March 2015extension study  (CL0600 -021) assessed s afety and efficacy  for up to 24 additional months 
(ie,up to 30 months of exposure for subjects who received teduglutide in Study  CL0600-020).
Overall, 30 of 43 subjects who received teduglutide in Study CL0600- 020 and entered 
Study CL0600
-021 completed a total of 30 months of treatment with teduglutide .  Of these,
28 subjects (93%) achieved a 20% or greater reduction of parenteral support resulting in a 
PN/I V volume reduction of 7.55 L/week, corresponding to a mean reduction of 65.6% relative 
to baseline prior to exposure to teduglutide at the beginning of Study CL0600 -021.  PN/I V 
frequency  was reduced by  at least 1 day per week in 21 of 30 subjects (70%) who completed 
30months of treatment .  Of the 39 subjects who entered Study CL0600- 021 after receiving 
placebo in Study CL0600- 020, 29 completed 24 months of treatment with teduglutide.  The 
mean reduction in PN/I V volume was 3.11 L/week from baseline at the start of 
Study CL0600- 021 (an additional 28% reduction).  Sixteen (55 .2%) of the 29 completers 
achieved a 20% or great er reduction of parenteral support.  Of the 12 subjects entering 
Study CL0600- 021 directly , 6 completed 24 months of treatment with teduglutide .  The mean 
reduction in PN/I V volume was 4.0 L/week (a 39 .4% reduction from baseline at the start of 
Study CL0600
-021) and 4 of the 6 completers (6 6.7%) achieved a 20% or greater reduction of 
parenteral support
1.2 Rationale for the Clinical Study
Short bowel sy ndrome is a rare disorder .  At the time of the initial development program with 
teduglutide , the Oley  Foundati on in 1992 reported an estimated preva lence of about 10,000 to 
15,000 parenteral nutrition ( PN)
-dependent adult SBS patients in the U.S. Most recentl y, 
market research performed in 2012 indicates that the true addressable adult patient population 
is between 3000 to 5000 patients which qualifies SBS as an ultra -orphan condition.  In addition 
to adult SBS patients, it is estimated that, at most, the re are a few hundred children 1 year and 
older with SBS.  As a result of congenital 
abnormalities or severe intestinal disease in children 
and adolescents, major surgical resections of the intestine can become necessary , resulting in 
SBS.  Common causes of SBS in children include necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in infants, 
midgut volvulus (volvulus), intestinal atresia, and gastroschisis ( Duro et al, 2008).  SBS in 
older children may  stem from the same etiologies as in adults (ie, Crohn’s disease, trauma, 
cancer). As the characteristics are similar to the adult disease, pediatric SBS is de fined as a 
disease where there is diminished absorptive capacity  for fluids and/or nutrients, sometimes 
requiring a dependence on PN/I V support to maintain energy  and clinical status.
There is heterogeneity  within SBS .  Where some patients with intestinal insufficiency are able 
to adapt metabolicall y and compensate for their malabsorption of fluids, electrolytes, trace 
elements, vitamins or nutrients by  increasing oral /enteral intake ( Messing et al, 199 9; Jeppesen
et al, 2000), other patients with intestina l failure depend on PN/IV for nutritional support 
(Fleming et al, 1980; O’Keefe et al,2006; Buchman 
et al, 2003).  Although PN/IV can provide 
this nutritional support for patients w ith compromised fluid and nutritional status, it is also 
Pediatric Study TED -C14 -006

Final v1.0
12 March 2015associated with serious complications, such as infections and liver damage.  The risk for these 
effects increases over time with longer duration of PN/I V support .
The same treatment options are currentl y available for children and the same associated risks 
prevail.  Treatment of both pediatric and adult patients is focused on achieving adequate 
intestinal absorption to allow for minimization or discontinuation of PN/I V support.  This is 
achieved far more successfull y in infants who develop SBS during the neonatal period and 
frequentl y come off their PN/I V requirements within 6 to12months of their initial surgical 
insult such that they  achieve enteral autonom y by age 1 year.  Recent data suggest that up to 
85% of pa tients achieve spontaneous adaptation by age 1 year.
In the US, data from the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network reflect improvement in 
the medical and non -transplant surgical management of intestinal failure after 2010.  The peak
number of pediatric intestinal transplants in North America occurred between 2004 to 2009 (up 
to 111 in 2007) with falling levels from about 2010 onward (52 to 62 transplants annually ). In 
2012, 56 transplants took place and i n 2013, 36 transplants took place.
This study  proposes to investigate the safe and approria te use of teduglutide in the pediatric 
population for up to 24 weeks for the purpose of providing longer
-term data in regard to safet y 
and potential to explore further efficacy including PN reduction a nd ability  to completely  wean 
off parenteral support .  This protocol was developed with input from expert advisors from 
intestinal rehabilitation centers who offered advice on the most appropriate use of teduglutide
in pediatric patients.  The aim of tedug lutide treatment isto increase absorptive capacity  in 
order to yield decreases in parenteral support.  The experts anticipated that there would be 
several direct benefits from decreased parenteral support, including less exposure to PN/IV 
constituents, le ss central line manipulation with lower risk of infection, and more time to focus 
on oral rehabilitation strategies.
1.3 Rationale for Study Design 
Dose
The efficacy  and safet y of teduglutide has been investigated at doses ranging from 0.03 to 
0.15 mg/kg once daily  (QD) in adult SBS subjects requiring PN.  The 
recommended clinical 
dosage for the adult SBS patient population is 0.05 mg/kg QD.  Population pharmacokinetic 
(PK) modeling and simulations were conducted to determine the dose to be used in pediatric 
subjects.  Subcutaneous dosing of teduglutide in pediatric patients with SBS w asbased on data 
collected in 5 adult Phase 1 studies and 3 adult Phases 2/3 studies, as well as an adult 
population PK meta -analy sis. The PK results from the adult SBS clinical program also were 
used to model and simulate PK parameters in pediatric SBS patients to provide guidance on 
pediatric dosing for teduglutide.  An ongoing 12 week pediatric stud y (TED- C13-003) includes 
doses of 0.0125, 0.025, and 0.05 mg/kg/day .  Interim da ta evaluated b y the DSMB has 
concluded that all three doses are safe and tolerable with trends of PN/IV volume reduction 
Pediatric Study TED -C14 -006
Teduglutide (rDNA origin) for subcutaneous injection
Page 20of 68
Final v1.0
12 March 2015and advance in feeds observed. Modeling and simulation data from previously  completed
studiessuggested that pediatric patients are likely  to require the same dose as used in adults 
and that the 0.05 mg/kg/day  adult dose will be sufficient to provide similar bloo d levels in all 
subjects over 1 year of age .  To further explore additional safety  and efficacy , a 24 week stud y 
is currentl yproposed.
Treatment Duration/Design
Safety , tolerability  and p harmacod ynamic measures over a 24 -week period will be the main 
outcom es of the current study .  The m ain PD effect of teduglutide to be measured in children 
will include a decrease in the volume of PN/IV requirement.  Measurement of a decrease in 
PN/I V volume requirements was the primary  endpoint in the adult SBS clinical studies and can 
be used in children with SBS who are dependent on PN/I V support.
A 20% reducti on 
or greater (including complete weaning) from baseline in volume of PN/I V at 
the end of 24 weeks of treatment was used as the primary  endpoint in the adult clinical 
development program during pivitol Phase 3 studies and will be the same endpoint used i n the 
current pediatric stud y.
The current study  will employ  a double -blind, 2 arm design with treatment of either 
0.025 mg/kg/day  or 0.05 mg/kg/day  of teduglutide for up to 24 weeks.  The 24- week treatment 
period will provide further information on longer t erm safet y and additional efficacy  including 
complete weaning of treatment bey ond the 12 -
week period previousl y evaluated in the first 
pediatric stud y.
Thus, this study  is designed to provide further information on the safet y and PDprofile of 
teduglutide in pediatric subjects treated for up to 24 weeks .
Subject Population
The current significant unmet medical need is for patients over age 1 year who remain 
dependent on parenteral support.  These patients reach a plateau in their ability  to advance 
oral/enteral feeds or decrease PN/IV 
support and are not expected to achieve spontaneous 
adaptation.  The subjects in the study  will be children whose intestines ha venot reached full 
enteral adaptation after 12months of PN/I V treatment and whose PN/IV requirement had been 
stable without any  clinically  meaningful or substantial reduction in parenteral support for the 
3months prior to study  enrollment.
Therefore, t his study  will be performed in PN/IV -dependent children with SBS aged 1 year
through 17 yearswho have demonstrated that they  have reached a plateau 
with regard to their 
ability  to fully  continue intestinal adaptation in terms of their ability  to advance feeds and 
subsequently  reduce their needs for parenteral support.  Stabilit y for these subjects will be
defined as at least 3 months in which patients still are requiring at least 30% of their volume 
and/or calories from PN/IV with no clinically  meaningful change in advances in their enteral 
feeds (specialized nutrition such as f ormula via mouth or tube).

Final v1.0
12 March 2015This study  will conducted in accordance with FDA Guidance E11, Clinical Investigation of 
Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population (December 2000).
Gastrointestinal Screening Measures
Pediatric SBS patients who are dependent on PN/IV have significant comorbidities such as 
biliary  disease in addition to risk for obstruc tion due to history  of surgery . Teduglutide has 
been found to have a targeted intens tinotrophic effect on th e GI tract and areas of special 
interest in regards to safety  have been identified throughout the development program. Taken 
into account the patient population and the pharmacologic effect of teduglutide, GI -specific 
screening tests which are usually  part of the routine care of these subject s will be pe rformed to 
ensure safet y. These include: abdominal ultrasound, upper GI series with contrast, fecal 
occult blood testing, and ,if deemed clinically  relevant , colonoscop y/sigmoidoscopy .
General Guidance for Nutritional Support Adjustment
Consideration for advancement of oral/enteral feed and reductions to PN/IV volume will be 
based on clinical status, which will include measures for weight, growth, and hy dration status.  
The pharmacod ynamic endpoint for this study  is a ≥ 20% reduction in PN/IV support guid ed 
by clinical status. A suggested guidance for nutrition support adjustment is provided in 
Appendix 1and should be followed b y all sites to ensure uniform care across study  sites and 
particpants.
2 OBJECTIVES
2.1 Primary Objective
The objective of this clinic al study  is to evaluate the safet y, tolerability , efficacy ,and 
pharmacod ynamic effects of teduglutid e in pediatric subjects (aged 1 year through 17 years) 
with SBS who are dependent on parenteral support.
See Section
8.2and Section 8.3for further details of the variables being measured.
3 STUDY DESIGN
3.1 Overall Design and Control Methods
This will be a double- blind, 2 arm study  in which subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive either 0.025 mg/kg/day  or 0.05 mg/kg/day  of teduglutide for 24 weeks.  Dosing 
regimens will be blinded to both investigators and subjects.  In addition, an attempt will be 
made to enroll subjects in a separate standard of care cohort , which will serve as an 
obser vational cohort for the 24 -week treatment period .  The subjects in the standard of care 
cohort will follow the same visit schedule as the randomized subjects.
All subjects will be screened for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to start of treatment to verify  the 
requirements for nutritional support for each subject and to ensure adherence to eligibility

12 March 2015parameters.   After screening, the 24- week treatment period will consist of visits at baseline, 
week lyfor the first 2 weeks, and then every  
other week through Week 12.  From Weeks 13 to 
24, visits at the sites will be conducted at Weeks 15, 18, 21, and 24.  Telephone contacts will 
be made on all other weeks during the treatment period in order to monitor safet y.  A final visit
will be scheduled at Week 28, 4 weeks f ollowing the end of treatment (EOT) .  Telephone 
contact will be made during the interim weeks from EOT to end of study  (EOS).  If necessary , 
unscheduled visits can be arranged in place of the telephone contacts.   Schedule sof study  
parameters aredisplay edinTable 
6-1and Table 6-2.
To maintain consistency  acr
oss all centers, sites and subjects (treated and standard of care ) 
must follow the nutritional support ad
justment guidelines (developed with SBS expert input 
and provided in Appendix 1)for decisions regarding PN/IV support reduction and advances in 
enteral feeds based on weight gain, urine, and stool output in the setting of clinical stability .
At the conclusion of the follow -up period (Week 28), if subject s are determined to have 
posit ive/specific antibodies , they  will be asked to return for a follow -up visit 3 months post
EOT for another antibody  sample. If the subject s continued to have positive/specific antibodies
at 3months post EOT, they  will be asked to return for follow -up visit (s) up to 6months 
post-treatment in order to determine their antibody status. At all follow -up visits, an a
ssessment 
of the subject ’s current PN/I V support and an adverse event determi
nation will be conducted.
Safety  and tolerability  results will be evaluated b y a DSMB every  3months during the active 
study  period (date of the first subject’s first dose to date of the last subject’s last dose) .  The 
DSMB review will include all cumulative s afety data (ie, adverse events, laboratory  
assessments, phy sical examinations, etc.) from study  assessments through each cuto ff period 
including an y reaso ns for dose adjustment and discontinuations.

4.4 Subject Withdrawal Criteria
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation in this study  at any  time, for an y reason, 
specified or unspecified.  However, a discussion should be held by  the investigator and the 
NPS Medical Monitor prior to the patient discontinuing/with drawing.  A subject may  (but not 
automatically ) be withdrawn from the stud y under an y of the following circumstances:
Withdrawal of informed consent and/orassent when applicable
If, in the opinion of the investigator, Institutional Review Board ( IRB)or NPS, it is no 
longer in the subject’s best interest to continue in the study
Subject no longer meets all inclusion criteria or meets an y criterion for exclusion
Lack of compliance with study  procedures or study  drug administration, as determined by  
the inve stigator
Occurrence of a serious adverse event ( SAE )determined by  the investigator to be possibly  
related to stud y drug and not alleviated with treatment of symptoms
Adverse event (including Grade 3 or 4 events of special interest [ Section 6.1.4])
Hyperse nsitivity  determined by  the investigator to be possibly  related to study  drug
Administrative reasons
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the electronic case report form 
(eCRF) and in the subject’s medical records.  If the reason is not known, the subject must be 
followed- up to establish whether the reason was an AE and, if so, th
e AE must be reported in 
accordance with the procedures described in Section 6.1.1.  Reasons for discontinuation other 
than AEs must be reported within 4 weeks of the EOS date in order to be included in the 
database.  Any reason for discontinuation obtained after th is time will be included in the 
subject’s medical record only unless the EOS visit date is amended and the database remains 
open .

4.5 Data Safety Monitoring Board
The DSMB for this study will be conducted in accordance with the FDA Guidance for Clinical 
Trial Sponsors: Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees 
(March 2006) .
The DSMB will be an external, independent board comprised of ph ysicians with relevant 
training and an independent statistician (not associated with NPS, study  sites, or investigators). 
The DSMB will be restricted to individuals free of significant conflict s of interest, including, 
but not limited to, financial, scientific, or regulatory in nature. The DSMB will be governed b y 
a Charter agreed to b y members of the Board and the sponsor. Members of the Board may  not 
be study  investigators, individuals employ ed by NPS, independent contractors hired b y NPS, or 
members of regulatory  agencies. The DSMB may serve as an advisory board to NPS; however, 
NPS will have the final responsibility  to determine whether the study  should be modified or 
temporaril y or permanen tly stopped. 
The DSMB members will review the data approximately  every  3months after the beginning of 
dosing of the first subject and then approximately  every  3 months thereafter.  The DSMB will 
be provided the following:  1) all cumulative safety  data f rom the stud y for safet y assessments ; 
2) data related to pharmacody namics and the nutritional progress (ie, an y changes in the use of 
PN/I V and/or enteral nutrition) of each subject; and 3) an y other data supporting the decision to 
discontinue teduglutide throughout the stud y.
5 TREATMENTS AND TREAT MENT PLAN
5.1 Treatment Administered
Daily  doses of either 0.025 mg/kg/day  or 0.05 mg/kg/day  of teduglutide will be administered 
once dail y in the morning to the subjects in the active treatment cohort s.  The dose calc ulation 
will be based on bod y weight measured at the Baseline Visit (Visit 2) .  No adjustments to dose 
will be made during the study  period . Teduglutide will be administered by  SC injection into 
1 of the 4 quadrants of the abdomen (in subjects without a s toma) or either thigh or arm.
Identification of Investigation alProduct 5.1.1
Teduglutide will be provided in a sterile, single -use, glass vial as a l yophilized powder to be 
reconstituted with 0.5 mL sterile water for injection provided as the diluent in a prefilled 
syringe.  The 5 -mg vial is 10 mg/mL  solution upon reconstitution.  The 2.5 -mg vial is 
5mg/mL .A maximum of 0.38 mL  of reconstituted solution can be withdrawn from the vial.
Pediatric Study TED -C14-006
Teduglutide (rDNA origin) for subcutaneous injection
Page 30of 68
Final v1.0
12 March 2015In addition to the active ingredient (teduglutide), each vial of teduglu tide contains L -histidine, 
mannitol, monobasic sodium phosphate monohy drate, and dibasic sodium phosphate as 
excipients.
All vial strengths have the same formulation except for a reduced concentration of the active 
ingredient in the lower strength.
Packagi ng and Labeling 5.1.2
The study  drug will be packaged, labeled, and shipped to the study  site b y the sponsor or 
designee.  Study  drug vial will b e supplied in kits containing 7 vials and labeled with the 
protocol number, the investigational drug warning, general dosage instructions, storage 
conditions, expiry  date, kit number, lot number, and company  name.  Space will be provided 
for recording stud y site and subject numbers at the study site. Ancillary  supply  kits containing 
syringes with needles for injection a nd reconstitution, sterile water, and alcohol swabs will also 
be provided.
All study  drug used in this study  will be manufactured, tested, labeled, and released according 
to current legal requirements and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP).
Storage, Account ability, and Stability 5.1.3
Study  drug will not be dispatched to the stud y siteuntil the sponsor /designee has received all 
required documents from the study  sitein accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements 
and relevant standard operating procedures. Upon receipt, the stud y site’s pharmacist or 
delegate is responsible for ensuring that all study drug received at the siteis inventoried and 
accounted for throughout the study .  A copy  of the shipping documents must be maintained for 
the investigator’s r ecords.
Study  drug must be kept in a locked area with access restricted to specific study  personnel.  
Study  drug will be stored refrigerated at a temperature between 2 to 8oC(35.6 to 4 6.4oF)until 
dispensed to a subject.  Once dispensed to a subject, th e study  drug can be stored refrigerated 
up to a controlled room temperature (acceptable range of 2 to 25 oC, or 35.6 to 77 oF).  
Parent/guardian will be instructed to keep the subject’s stud y drug and sterile water diluent at 
controlled room temperature. If there are concerns that the controlled room temperature cannot 
be maintained, the stud y drug may  be refrigerated.
Study  drug kits will be dispensed at each of the study  visits at which the subject is required to 
be at the clinic. Each study  drug kit i s sufficient for a treatment period of 1 week and enough 
kits will be supplied to cover the period to the next planned study  visit. Additional study  kits
will be provided as necessary .
The investigator is to keep a current record of the inventory and disp ensing of all clinical 
supplies.  This record will be made available to the sponsor’s site monitor for the purpose of 
accounting for all clinical supplies. Any  discrepancy  or deficiency  will be recorded and will 
Pediatric Study TED -C14 -006
Teduglutide (rDNA origin) for subcutaneous injection
Page 31of 68
Final v1.0
12 March 2015include an explanation. All supplies sent t o the investigator must be accounted for and in no 
case will clinical supplies be used in an y unauthorized situation.
All used and unused study  drug vials must be returned by  the subjects and/or parent/guardian
and will be retained at the site. All origina l containers, whether empt y or containing study drug 
will be returned to the pharmacy .  Returned study  drugs will NOT be relabeled or reassigned 
for use b y other subjects.  Contents of the study  drug containers will not be combined.  All
study  drug will be returned according to the sponsor’s instructions.
5.2 Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
At screening, subjects will be assigned an 8 -digit subject number.  The first 4 digits consist of 
the study  site number.  The last 4 digits will be assigned sequentially  starting with 0001.  Th ese
number swill be used to identify  the subject sthroughout the study  period
, including an y 
subjects in the standard of care cohort .  If a subject who participated in the pre vious teduglutide 
study , TED -C13-003, who was assigned and completed the study  in the standard of care cohort 
wishes to participate, that subject will be assigned the 8 -digit subject number used in the 
previous study .
At any  time during the 2- week minimum screening period, the subject or subject ’s 
parent/guardian/caretaker will decide whether to participate in the dosing cohort or the 
standard of care cohort.  At the end of the screening period, the investigator will review and 
confirm that the subject con tinues to meet all Inclusion/Exclusion criteria .  If the subject or 
subject’s parent/guardian/caretaker decides to participate in the dosing cohort, t he investigator 
or designee will request the subject be randomized at the Baseline Visit using an interact ive 
voice response sy stem (IVRS) at a 1:1 ratio, centrally  administered asdescribed in the IVRS 
Manual of Procedures.
Study  drug kits will be assigned through IVRS to each subject at each on -site visit through
completion of the dosing period. The IVRS wil l automatically  assign the correct number of kits 
for each visit based on the date of randomization. If additional kits are needed (eg., subject is 
going on holiday ), the IVRS and NPS will need to be notified so that the additional kits can be 
assigned.  Subjects will be randomized across centers rather than within center.
Those subjects opting for the standard of care cohort will continue in the study  
but without the 
study  drug.
5.3 Dose Regimens
Teduglutide will be supplied in 2 strengths :
5.0 mg/vial for su bjects receiving 0.05 mg/kg/day  of teduglutide
2.5 mg/vial for subjects requiring 0.025 mg/kg/day .
Pediatric Study TED -C14-006

Final v1.0
12 March 2015Subjects in the active treatment group sare to have the study  drug administered dailyin the 
morning by SC injection into 1 of the 4 quadrants of the abdomen or into either thigh or arm, 
for 24weeks. The initial dose will be calculated based on body  weight measured at the 
Baseline Visit (Visit 2).
Selection of Doses in Study 5.3.1
Arecently  completed 12 -week pediat ric stud y (TED -C13-003) i ncluded doses of 0.0125, 
0.025, and 0.05 mg/kg/day .  Data evaluated by the DSMB concluded that all 3doses were safe 
and tolerable with trends of PN/I V volume reduction and advance in feeds observed.  Modeling 
and simulation data from previously  completed studiessuggested that pediatric patients are 
likely  to require the same dose as used in adults and that the 0.05 mg/kg/day  adult dose will be 
sufficient to provide similar bloo d levels in all subjects over 1 year of age .  
Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject 5.3.2
The study  drug will be administered immediately  after reconstitution by SC injection into 1 of 
the 4 quadrants of the abdomen or into either thigh or arm. The first SC injection should be 
administered under the supervision of the investigator or designee and the subject observed for 
hypersensitivity  reactions for at least 4hours during their initial dosing visit . The site of 
administration (arm, thigh, abdomen) of the first teduglutide dose must be specified and 
recorded in the eCRF .  Detailed instructions for reconstitution and injection of the study  drug 
can be found in the Injection I nstruction s. Each day, the injection site should be changed. For 
subjects with a stoma, the abdominal quadrant in which the stoma is situated should b e 
avoided.
The subject should be dosed at approximately the same time each day , preferabl y in the 
morning. If a morning dose is forgotten, that day ’s dose should be administered as soon as
possible, even if this is later in the day  or evening. Consecutiv e doses should be separated b y 
approximately  12 hours.   The time of the dose should be captured in the appropriate area in the 
subject diary .
The investigator is responsible for contacting the sponsor /designee prior to interrupting the 
subject’s daily  stud y drug dosing regimen. Reasons for dosage interruptions may include but 
are not limited to hospitalization, adverse events, forgotten doses, lapse in study drug delivery, 
etc.  A single discontinuation period of study  drug should not exceed 10consecutive days. 
Dosage interruptions of study  drug for a maximum of 21days total during the entire 24weeks 
are permissible.
Compliance with Dosing Regimens 5.3.3
Subject compliance with study drug dosing will be monitored by the sponsor /designee b y 
counting and exami ning used and unused vials. In addition, compliance will be checked by 
site personnel at every  visit by  asking the subject or the subject’s parent or guardian if they  
Pediatric Study TED -C14-006
Teduglutide (rDNA origin) for subcutaneous injection
Page 33of 68
Final v1.0
12 March 2015have administered the study  drug according to instructions.   If any doses have been miss ed, the 
reason for missed dose should be documented in the subject’s source documentation including, 
as applicable, the eCRF.
Compliance is considered to be achieved if the subject has 80% of the planned doses 
administered.
Prior and Concomitant Medications 5.3.4
The administration of all medications including concomitant medications must be recorded in 
the appropriate sections of the eCRF.
In general, no new medications should be started during the scre ening period or throughout the 
24-week treatment period, unless medically  necessary  and prescribed b y the investigator or b y 
another qualified ph ysician involved in the subject’s clinical care and who is aware of the 
subject’s study  participation.
The mechanism of action of teduglutide may  increase absorption of d rugs (eg, motility  
medication including narcotics and opioids used for the management of SBS , Coumadin, 
psychotropics, metronidazole, digoxin), so consideration should be given to modify ing 
concomitant medication regimens. Down -titration of conc omitant medication sshould be 
considered when drugs, including those with a narrow therapeutic range, are given at dosages 
that are higher than usual.
6 STUDY EVALUATIONS AN D PROCEDURES
6.1 Evaluations for Safety and Tolerability
Safety  variables for the teduglu tide dosing groups will be assessed b y the following 
evaluations ,according to Schedule sof Evaluations and Procedures as outlined in Table 6-1and
Table 6-2, with opportunities for more frequent tests as clinically  necessary .  Safety  variables 
for the sta ndard of care cohort are display ed in Table 6-3and Table 6-4.

Nutritional i ntake and urinary /fecal o utput (when available)
GI-specific testing including imaging (eg, colonoscopy, sigmoidoscop y),abdominal 
ultrasound, fecal occult blood testing , upper GI series with small bowel follow -through
Adverse Events 6.1.1
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of an y AE or SAE, as 
defined in this protocol, during the stud y.
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event Definition
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical/medicinal product.  An AE does not necessarily have to 
have a causal re lationship with this treatment.
An AE c an therefore be any  unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically  significant 
abnormal laboratory  finding, for example), sy mptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal product (investigational or marketed), whether or not c onsidered related to 
treatment with the medicinal product.
An AE includes:
An exacerbation of a pre -existing illness, sign, symptom, or clinically  significant (as 
determined b y the investigator) laboratory test abnormality and clinically significant ECG 
abnormality
An illness, sign, sy mptom, or clinically  significant laboratory  abnormality that is detected 
or diagnosed after stud y drug administration
Pre-treatment or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol -mandated 
procedures
An AE does n ot include:
The disease or disorder being studied or signs and symptoms associated with the disease or 
disorder, unless there is worsening of the condition of the disease or disorder
A pre -existing disease or condition, present at the start of the study, t hat does not worsen
Overdose
Defined as an accidental or intentional administration of an excessive dose of a product, an 
overdose should be reported to the sponsor using the SAE form.  This information will be 
shared with the NPS Safety  Management Team (S MT) and the sponsor’s medical monitor.
Pediatric Study TED -C14 -006
Teduglutide (rDNA origin) for subcutaneous injection
Page 35of 68
Final v1.0
12 March 20156.1.1.2 Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events
Adverse events may  be spontaneously  reported b y the subject or subject’s parent/guardian , 
obtained through nonleading questioning, or noted during examination of a subject.  All AEs 
and SAEs will be recorded from the signing of the informed consent form ( ICF) through the 
last day  of study  drug dosing , or the last study  required procedure (inc luding stud y visit) .  
SAEs will be monitored with a telephone call by  the investigator, as necessary , for 
approximately  4 weeks after the last dose of stud y drug or until resolution or until the SAE is 
judged b y the investigator to have stabilized.   
As they occur, new AEs will be recorded sequentially  on the AE page of the eCRF.  The AE 
term should note the diagnosis whenever possible, not the individual signs or sy mptoms 
(eg,myocardial infarction should be recorded rather than chest pain, elevated cardi ac enz ymes, 
and abnormal ECG).  Also recorded are: 
Start and stop date and time
Whether the event is continuing
Frequency  (intermittent, continuous)
Intensit y (mild, moderate, severe)
o Mild:  usually  transient, requiring no special treatment and generally  not interfering 
with usual daily  activities
o Moderate:  usuall y ameliorated b y simple therapeutic maneuvers and impairs usual 
activities
o Severe:  requires vigorous therapeutic intervention and interrupts usual activities ;
hospitalization may  or may  not be r equired.
Relationship to study  drug (not related, related): identify  relationship as “related” if a 
causal relationship between the investigational product and an AE is at least a reasonable 
possibility  (ie, the relationship cannot be ruled out)
Whether th e AE is serious (ie, an SAE).  If identified as an SAE, the AE should be reported 
on the SAE form according to Section 6.1.2 below
Actions taken (none; study  drug dose changed, interrupted, or discontinued; other 
medication change; nondrug therap y) 
Outcome (resolved, resolved with sequelae, ongoing, fatal).  An individual AE receives 
only one outcome.
Adverse events that are related to study drug and not resolved at the end of treatment will be 
followed b y the site until resolution or until the AE is judged b y the investigator to have 
stabilized.

Page 36of 68
Final v1.0
12 March 2015Laboratory  values, blood pressure, ECG evaluations, and clinical findings at the scheduled 
physical examinations must be reported as AEs if they :
Are considered clinically significant b y the investigator
Fulfill SAE criteria, and/or
Cause subject discontinuation from the study
Serious Adverse Events 6.1.2
A serious event must be reported as described in Section 6.1.2.2 and recorded on the sponsor’s 
SAE Form.  AnSAE requires expeditious handling to compl y with regulatory  requirements.  
Any SAEs occurring from the signing of the ICF through 30 day s after the last dose of study  
drug will be captured and must be reported within 24 hours after the investigator is made aware 
of the event.
6.1.2.1 Serious Adverse Event Defini tion
An SAE is an AE that results in any  of the following outcomes:
Death 
Is life -threatening.  A life -threatening AE is an y AE that places the subject -in the 
investigator’s opinion -at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  I t does
not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused 
death.
Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of ability  to conduct normal life 
functions
Hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Congenital anomal y/birth defect
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may  be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they  may  jeopardize the subject or may requ ire medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  room 
or at home, blood dy scrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
Scheduled and/or elective hospitalizations occurring under the following circumstances will 
not be defined as SAEs for this clinical study :
planned before entry  into the clinical study
are for elective treatment of a condition unrelated to the studied indication or its treatment
Pediatric Study TED -C14 -006
Teduglutide (rDNA origin) for subcutaneous injection
Page 37of 68
Final v1.0
12 March 2015occur on an emergency , outpatient basis and do not result in admission (unless fulfilling the 
previous criteria)
are part of the normal treatment or monitoring of the studied indication and not associated 
with any  deterioration in condition
Any laboratory  test result that meets the criteria for an SAE must also be recorded in an SAE 
report so that the sponsor /designee can collect additional information about that abnormality , 
including information regarding relationship to investigational product or other causes, an y 
action taken, and outcome.
6.1.2.2 Procedures for Reporting Serious Adverse Events
Within 24 hours of becoming aware of ANY SAE (regardless of its relationship to 
investigational product) that occurs during the course of the clinical study  from the time the 
subject signs the ICF through 30 days after the study  drug is completed, the investigator must 
notify  the sponsor.  T he SAE information , including the time and date that the investigator 
became aware of the event, must be entered into the SAE reporting s ystem and supplemental 
data (eg, medical records or lab values, if applicable) faxed to the sponsor .This ensures timely  
reporting of applicable reports to Health Authorities.  
Note:  Minimum criteria for reporting an SAE are the SAE term, an identifiable subject, a 
suspect investigational medical product (study  drug), and a reporter.  Hospitalization is not an 
AE, but a serious event criterion.  The SAE term is the medical event that led to the 
hospitalization.  Surgery  is not an adverse event, but the event that required the subject to have 
surgery  is the SAE term.  Death is not an SAE, but an outcom e.
The sponsor /designee will provide a FAX cover sheet for the investigators in the Study  
Reference Manual.
Autopsy  reports, if applicable, will be forwarded as they  become available.  All pertinent 
laboratory  results should be entered on the sponsor’s SAE form.
All SAEs must be reported, whether or not they  are considered causall y related to the study 
drug.  Appropriate clinical, diagnostic, and laboratory  measures should be performed to 
delineate the cause of the SAE in question and the results reported. Follow -up for the SAE 
should occur at appropriate intervals until the event/laboratory  abnormalit y:
Returns to baseline or
Becomes stable to a clinically  acceptable level that is safe for the subject.
The investigator is required to assess the causal rela tionship of each reported SAE, to the study  
drug ( seebelow ).  A causality  assessment should alway s be included on the sponsor’s SAE 
form.  The investigator should make the causality assessment based on the information 
Pediatric Study TED -C14 -006
Teduglutide (rDNA origin) for subcutaneous injection
Page 38of 68
Final v1.0
12 March 2015available at the time of the event.  The causality  can be updated at a future date if additional 
information is received.
The causality  categories are:
Not related
May or may  not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study  
product
Is biologicall y implausible and doe s not follow a known response pattern to the suspect 
study  product (if response pattern is previousl y known)
Can be explained by  the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state or other modes 
of therap y administered to the subject
Related (Possibly  Related/Probably  Related/Related)
A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly  associated 
with drug exposure (eg, angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Sy ndrome)
Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study  product
May follow a known response pattern to the study  product (if response pattern is previously  
known)
Could not be reasonabl y explained by  the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical 
state or other modes of therap y administered to the subject, if applicable
Recurs upon rechallenge after withholding and then reintroducing study  product
Contact information for SAE reporting and emergency  contact details can be found at the 
beginning of the protocol and in the Study  Reference Manua l.
As required b y International Conference of Harmonisation (I CH) guidelines and global health 
authorities, the sponsor/ designee will notify  investigators of all adverse drug reactions that are 
serious, unexpected, and deemed b y the reporting investigator or sponsor to be related to stud y 
drug (suspected, unexpected, serious, adverse reaction [SUSAR]).  Causality , while assessed, 
does not negate reporting requirements to the sponsor.  An AE, whether serious or not serious, 
is designated unexpected (unlabele d) if it is not reported in the clinical safety  section of the 
Investigator Brochure (IB) or if the event is of greater frequency, specificity , or severit y than is 
mentioned in the IB.  The investigator will receive a cop y of the current valid version of the IB 
prior to the start of the study ; however, the investigator will not be required to assess 
expectedness, nor should expectedness impact the investigator reporting SAEs within the 
timeframe herein defined.
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice.  As per 
regulatory  guidance, if it is determined that there is an unanticipated signal, the NPS SMT will 
analyze the data and prepare a summary  supporting the determination and interpretation of the 
Pediatric Study TED -C14-006

Final v1.0
12 March 2015findings.   The sponsor /designee will send this summary  to the investigators with instructions to 
provide it to their IEC/ IRB.
The investigator should also comply  with the IEC/ IRB procedures for reporting an y other 
safet y information (ie, autopsy reports).
NPS Pharmaceuticals (s ponsor) will be responsible for submitting SUSAR reports to the 
appropriate health authorities.  These reports will be submitted within the expedited timeframe.  
All fatal and life -threatening SUSAR reports will be submitted by the sponsor or designee 
within 7 day s of receipt (Day  0) of the initial report.  All other SUSAR reports will be 
submitted by  Day  15 following the event.
Unblinding 6.1.3
If a subject becomes pregnant or seriousl y ill during the stud y, the blind should be broken onl y 
if knowledge of the study medication administered will affect treatment options available to the 
subject.  Before breaking the blind, the investigator should contact the NPS Medical Monitor 
for discussion on whether unblinding of the subject is warranted.  If warranted, the s ponsor will 
place an unblinding call to the IVRS to receive treatment assignment information.  I n the case 
of an extreme emergency and if the Medical Monitor is immediately unreachable, the 
investigator should break the blind through the IVRS. Please see M anual of Procedures for 
further details.
In the event prior authorization from the NPS Medical Monitor is not possible, the NPS 
Medical Monitor must be notified by  telephone immediately , but no later than 24 hours 
following the unblinding of an y subject for an y reason.  A record should be kept of when the 
blind was broken, who broke it, and wh y.
Dose Interruption of Individual Subjects 6.1.4
Teduglutide administration for an individual subject may  need to be stopped if the subject has 
an adverse event of special interest (see risks in table below) that is Grade 3 or higher as 
defined b y the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE).  This may occur if an event is attributable to study  drug or a subject experiences an 
unexpl ained CTCAE Grade 3 or higher that is not reasonabl y related to the underlying disease 
process. The determination of length of the discontinuation, temporary  or permanent, depends 
on the clinical situation. A treatment -emergent SAE of special interest th at leads to study  drug 
interruption/discontinuation will be assigned a Grade 3 or 4, if applicable, by the investigator 
during the SAE reporting and follow -up process.
Investigators and the DSMB should be guided b y the descriptions of Grade 3 and 4 events 
below, as they  relate to identified risks associated with the administration of teduglutide.

Early Termination of the Clinical Study 6.1.5
The DSMB may  recommend to stop the study  if:
≥ 2 subject s being administered study drug dev elop the same CTCAE Grade 3 or
1 subject develops a CTCAE Grade 4 adverse event which is attributable to study drug 
or is not reasonabl y related to the underl ying disease process
Laboratory Evaluations 6.1.6
The following l aboratory parameters will be examined according to the Schedule sof 
Evaluations and Procedures as outlined in Table 6-1andTable 6-2 ( Table 6-3andTable 6-4
for the standard of care cohort ).While not all abnormal laboratory  results would be considered 
clinically significant as determined by  the investigato r (ie, those that are associated with the 
disease state and were present at baseline), those that are determined to be a clinically  
significant change (ie, worsening) from baseline or known medical history  will be considered 
adverse events.   All such abnormal laboratory  values that are considered AEs must be recorded 
on the appropriate eCRF.  A result outside of the normal range may  be repeated for 
confirmation.  An y laboratory test result that meets the criteria for an SAE ( Section 6.1.2 )must 
also be recorded in an SAE re port so that the sponsor /designee can collect additional 
information about that abnormality, including information regarding relationship to 
investigational product or other causes, an y action taken, and outcome.

according to the Schedule sof Evaluations and Procedur es (Table 6-1and Table 6-2).
Physical Examinations 6.1.7
Complete and comprehensive phy sical examinations will be performed by a medicall y 
qualified person during the study  to assess the subject’s ph ysical status, according to the 
Schedule sof Evaluations and Procedures (Table 6-1and Table 6-2)(Table 6-3andTable 6-4
for the standard of care cohort ).
Any significant finding at baseline should be included in the subject’s medical history eCRF , 
including known lab abnormalities such as decreased hemoglobin as part of anemia, history  of 
elevated liver enzy mes, etc. Any clinicall y significant changes from baseline (in the opinion of 
the investigator) noted during the ph ysical examinations, whether or not these procedures are 
required b y the protocol, should be recorded on the appropriate AE page of the eCRF. This 
will assist the sponsor /designee in collecting additional information about that abnormality, 
including information regarding relationship to investigational product or other causes, an y 
action taken, and outcome.
Vital Signs and Body Weight 6.1.8
Vital signs will be measured according to the Schedule sof Evaluations and Procedures (Table 
6-1and Table 6-2) (Table 6-3andTable 6 -4for the standard of care cohort ).Measurements 
will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg), pulse (beats per minute), and body  
temperature (oC), to be recorded after the subject has been sitting for 5 minutes.  Bod y weight
(kg),height (length [cm] ), and head circumference (cm) will also be recorded on the eCRF .   
Subjects should be weighed on the same scale at each study visit.
Any clinically  significant changes (ie, worsening) in the opinion of the investigator noted in 
vital signs assessments (ie, those that are associated with the disease state and were present at 
baseline) , should be recorded on the appropriate AE page of the eCRF. This will assist the

Gastrointestinal -specific Testing 6.1.10
Gastrointestinal testing will be done for all subjects during the screening period.  Follow -up 
testing will be performed as necessary  according to the guidelines noted below. See Table 6-1
andTable 6-2for details and scheduling.
6.1.10.1 Upper Gastrointestinal Series with Contrast
An upper GI with small bowel follow through (UGI /SBFT) will be performed following the 
ingestion of barium contrast material .  Results from procedures performed within 6months 
prior to Visit 1 will also be acceptable.
6.1.10.2 Abdominal Ultrasound
An abdominal ultrasound will be performed . Results from procedures performed within 
6 months prior to Visit 1 will also be acceptable.
6.1.10.3 Fecal Occult Blood Testing
Fecal occult blood testing will be performed at screening and at the end of treatm ent. Subjects
with positive results for fecal occult blood will undergo a confirmatory  
colonoscop y/sigmoidoscopy .  If no known underlying documented etiology can be attributed to 
this finding, the results should be discussed with the NPS Medical Monitor.
Subjects with negative scope results may enroll in the study
Subjects with positive scope results who receive trea tment may  enroll in the study
Subjects with positive scope results who do not receive treatment will be excluded from the 
study
In those subjects with positive results for fecal occult blood at the end of the study , the 
investigator will have to determine the cause for the finding and may perform an additional 
colonoscop y/sigmoidoscopy ,ifclinically  warranted .
6.1.10.4 Colonoscopy/Sigmoido scopy
Subjects age 12years and older will undergo a colon oscopy /sigmoidosc opyat screening .  
Children under the age of 12 years will also undergo the procedure if they  had a positive result 
on the fecal occult blood testing (see above) . Results from proc edures performed within 1year
prior to Visit 1 will also be acceptable.

12 March 2015Concomitant Medication Assessment 6.1.11
The subject’s usage of concomitant medication will be assessed at each clinic visit and the 
details of an y medications and changes in medication or d osage of medications will be 
recorded on the eCRF.
Nutritional Support Usage 6.1.12
Consideration for advancement of oral/enteral feed and reductions to PN/IV volume will be 
based on clinical status which will include measures for weight, growth, and hydration status.  
The pharmacod ynamic endpoint sfor this study  include decreases in PN/IV volume reduction 
including a ≥ 20% or greater reduction up to 100% reduction (o r complete weaning )in PN/IV 
support guided b y clinical status.  A 20%decrease in PN/I V volume over 24 weeks is 
considered clinically  meaningful to these PN/IV -dependent children who have plateaued in 
their ability  to wean PN/IV and advance their oral/ent eral feeds.  A decrease of this magnitude 
may translate to several hours a day  for more age -appropriate activities or an opportunity  to 
introduce an extra oral/enteral feed to encourage oral rehabilitation. A guidance for nutrition 
support adjustment to be followed for this protocol is provided in Appendix 1.
Evaluation of each subject’s nutritional support will be made during screening and at all visits 
at the study  site.  The following information will be collected and can be used to evaluate each 
subjec t’s nutritional support :
PN/IV support volume and calories
Enteral nutrition volume and calories
72-hour EN/ oral fluid intake
72-hour urine output
72-hour stool output (when available)
Diaries 6.1.13
Subjects or s ubjects’ parent or guardian will record the subjects’ oral/enteral fluid intake, 
PN/IVsupport ,and urine output on diaries throughout the screening period , the 24-week stud y 
period (or if earl y terminated, at the end of treatment), and 4 weeks after the e nd of treatment .
Subjects should bring completed diaries to each site visit.  Diaries should be completed during
the 72hours prior to scheduled visits which will be reviewed b y the investigator or their 
designee to assess clinical status and opportunity  for PN/I V changes and advance in feeds.   At 
each visit, the diaries will be reviewed for completeness and accuracy of the data.
Female Subjects of Child -bearing Potential 6.1.14
Any female subject in an active treatment group who has reached menarche must have a 
negative urine pregnancy test to enroll or continue in the study .Pregnancy  tests will be

12 March 2015performed at screening and at all study  visits.  Sexually  active females of child -bearing 
potential (FOCBP) must use medicall y acceptable methods of birth control dur ing and for 
30days after the treatment period (e g, true abstinence1, oral contraceptive pills ,barrier 
methods with spermicide )in a manner such that the risk of failure is minimized.  The 
investigator will discuss these methods as well as their side effe cts with the subject.
At the time of signing the I CF/assent , FOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding 
pregnancy  during trial participation, and the potential risk factors for pregnancy . Male subjects 
must be advised that their partners must use medically  acceptable methods of birth control 
during and for 30 day s after the treatment.
In the event a subject becomes pregnant during the study , study  drug will be discontinued and 
an SAE form will be completed to capture potential drug exposure during pregnancy .  The 
SAE will be reported within 24 hours of becoming aware of the pregnancy.  The subject will 
be followed until an outcome is known ( ie,normal delivery , abnormal delivery , spontaneous 
abortion (miscarriage), voluntary  abortion, or therapeutic abortion).  If a pregnant subject also 
experiences an SAE, the SAE form will be completed and submitted within 24 hours as 
discussed above.
In the event a female partner of a subject becomes pregnant within 30 day s after the subject 
completes the trial an d she or the fetus experiences an SAE, the SAE is deemed “suspected” to 
study  drug b y the principal investigator and a supplemental SAE form will be completed to 
capture the event.
                                                
1True abstinence:  Abstention of sexual activity that is in line w ith the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. 
(Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not 
acceptable methods of contr aception).

antibodies to ted uglutide at the Week 2 8visit will have follow -up blood draws for positive/specific antibodies to teduglutide at approximately 3 months following the last dose of 
study drug. If antibodies are still positive/specific they will be collected again approximat ely 6 months after the last d ose of study drug.  Adverse events and PN/IV support will 
also be assessed at these visits.
hDiaries will include recordings fororal/enteral dietary intake, PN/IV support volume, EN/oral fluid intake, stool/urine output .
iDuring the period between Visits 2 6and 2 7 (Weeks 25, 26, and 27), the study staff willcomplete follow -up telephone contact(s) with the subject and parent/guardian/caretaker in 
order to monitor safety.  If a visit to the site by the subject is necessary, this can be completed as an Unscheduled Visit.
jIf fecal/occult blood is positive without explanation ,then a colonoscopy/sigm oidoscopy may be warranted.

12 March 20157 DATA MANAGEMENT
7.1 Data Collection
Upon entry  into the study ( informed consent /assent signed ),all subjects will be assigned an 
eight -digit subject number, includin g subject s in the standard of care cohort.  The first four 
digits consist of the study site number.  The last four digits will be assigned sequentially  
starting with 0001.  This number is the main identifier for subjects.
Data collected dur ing the study  will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF b y the investigational 
site staff. The staff will keep records of the subject’s visit in the files considered as source 
documents for that site (eg, hospital chart, research chart, etc .). Source data a re all information 
contained in original records of clinical findings, observations, or other trial -related activities 
necessary  for evaluation and reproducibility  of data (eg, progress notes, hospital records, 
computer print -outs, screening logs, and recorded data from automated instruments). In case 
of computerized source data, the investigator must provide the sponsor access to the subject 
files at each monitoring visit. To ensure that data has been entered correctly on the eCRF, they  
will be 100% sour ce-data verified b y a site monitor from the sponsor/designee, who will notify  
the investigator regarding an y questions or discrepant data. The investigator or designee will 
be responsible for the timely  recording of subject data into the eCRF. 
The investigator and study  site must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IEC/IRB review, 
and regulatory  inspections by  providing direct access to source data/documents.
The investigator or designee will review all eCRFs (including the termination page after the
subject’s final visit) for completeness and accuracy, and will sign the eCRF via an electronic 
signature. The investigator will be responsible for reviewing the data in a timely  manner. Non-
eCRF data (eg, labs) will be sent to the sponsor/ designee via a d ata transfer from the 
appropriate vendor for assimilation into the database. Paper copies of laboratory  reports and 
other non- eCRF data (eg, ECGs) will be signed and dated by  the investigator and filed. 
Diaries will be used b y the subjects’ parent or gua rdian to record stud y information, includ ing
PN/I V support , enteral administration, urine output (as either collected or calculated volume), 
and nutritional intake.
All data collected in this study  will be entered into an appropriate pre- formatted databas e and 
submitted for statistical evaluation. The sites will be provided with eCRF guidelines outlining 
the specific procedures to use when entering the data into the clinical database. Data validation 
and edit checks will be conducted on the data. Any  discr epancies will generate queries that 
must be resolved at the study  site in a timel y manner. 
When all subjects’ data have been entered into the database, verified, and all outstanding issues 
have been resolved with the site, the data will be evaluated for quality  purposes. A clean file is 
Pediatric Study TED -C14 -006
Teduglutide (rDNA origin) for injection
Page 56of 68
Final v1.0
12 March 2015defined as when the data in the database and the reference values are complete and logical 
according to the clinical study  protocol, general guidelines, and data management plan. Once 
the sponsor /designee acknowledges that all data are acceptable, the data will be declared a 
“clean file,” and the data will be froz en/locked.
A quality  audit will be performed by the Data Management group .  When all issues from the 
audit are resolved, and all data management processes are completed for finalizing the 
database, the database will be read y for statistical anal ysis by  NPS or designee.
7.2 Record Rete ntion
All source documents, records, and reports will be retained b y the study  site in accordance with 
ICH guidelines. These documents include all primary  data or copies thereof (eg, drug records, 
copies of eCRFs, laboratory  recor ds, data sheets, corre spondence, signed subject 
consent /assent documents, ECGs, photographs, and computer records) which are a result of the 
original observations and activities of the study  and are necessary  for the reconstruction and 
evaluation of an y stud y report.
The clinical inve stigators will maintain copies of these essential documents for approximately  
10 years or as dictated b y local regulatory requirements or until instructed in writing b y the 
sponsor that records may be destro yed or forwarded to the sponsor.  In accordance with 
regulat ory guidelines, these records will be available for inspection and copy ingif requested b y 
a properl y authorized employ ee of the FDA /EU Health Authorities .
8 STATISTICAL METHODOL OGY AND SAMPLE SIZE
Detailed statistical anal ysis methods will be conducted as described in the S tatistical Analysis 
Plan (SA P) for this study.  Deviation s from the SAP (if any) will be described and justified in 
the clinical study  report (CSR). 
Due to the limited size of the study  population descriptive statistics will be used with a goal of
summarizing the sample which discourages the use of inferential statistics.
Continuous variables, including those assessed on a discrete scale, will be summarized using
descriptive statistics including number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation,
maximum, and minimum. For categorical variables, statistical sum maries will include number
of subjects and percentages.
8.1 Demographic and Baseline Variables
Demographic and/or other Baseline variables obtained at the screening and baseline visit are 
listed below.  Abnormal findings of clinical significance (if an y) will be recorded as past 
medical history .

Pediatric Study TED -C14-006
Teduglutide (rDNA origin) for injection
Page 60of 68
Final v1.0
12 March 2015be performed as secondary /sensitivity  anal ysis.  Detailed per -protocol evaluable definiti ons 
will be documented in the SAP.
8.7 Statistical/Analytical Issues
Adjustments for Covariates 8.7.1
No Baseline stratification parameter is employed in this study .
Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data 8.7.2
All subjects randomized will be included in the analy ses. Missing safet y parameters will not be
imputed. Details for the imputation algorithm for the missing endpoint values for PN/IV 
volume will be detailed in the SAP.
Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring 8.7.3
No interim anal yses are planned.
An independent DSMB will review the data on a routine basis and may  have access to data 
from the study  for safet y assessment. Details of the roles and responsibilities of the DSMB 
members and the structure and scope of the DSMB meetings will be provided in a separate 
DSMB Charter.
Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity 8.7.4
Given the small sample size, no hy pothesis testing will be conducted. Therefore, there will be 
no adjustment for alpha level.
Use of an Efficacy Subset of Subjects 8.7.5
A per -protocol population will be anal yzed for this stud y.
Examination of Subgroups 8.7.6
Because a small number of subjects are expected at each study  site, data from all study  sites 
will be pooled.
8.8 Determination of Sample Size
The sample size is determined based on the small patient population and the feasibility o f the 
study , rather than power calculation.
8.9 Changes to Planned Statistical Analyses
Changes made to planned statistical analyses (if any) described within this protocol will be 
incorporated into the SAP and any  deviations from the SAP will be documented and justified 
in the final CSR.

screening must also be maintained and be available for inspection.
9.4 Financial D isclosure
The FDA guidance document entitled “Financial Disclosure b y Clinical Investigators” 
(February  2013) provides guidance to industry  on its final rule on financial disclosure that 
became effective 02 February  1999 and was published as Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations 
Part 54.  This rule applies to all investigators participating in clinical studies to be submitted to 
the FDA in support of an application for market approval.  The financial disclosure statement 
must be updated if any relevant chang es occur during the course of the study , again at the site 
close -out visit, and for 1 year after the completion of the study .
According to the guidance, financial arrangements that must be disclosed are defined as the 
following:
Compensation made to the in vestigator in which the value of compensation could be 
affected b y stud y outcome 
A proprietary  interest in the tested product, including, but not limited to, a patent, 
trademark, cop yright, or licensing agreement
Any equity  interest in the sponsor of a co vered study  (ie, any  ownership interest, stock 
options, or other financial interest whose value cannot be readil y determined through 
reference to public prices) 
An equity  interest in a publicly  held company  that exceeds $50,000 in value 
Significant pay ments of other sorts, which are pay ments that have a cumulative monetary  
value of $25,000 or more made b y the sponsor of a covered stud y to the investigator or the 
investigator’s institution to support activities of the investigator exclusive of the cos ts of 
conducting the clinical study  or other clinical studies, (eg, a grant to fund ongoing research, 
compensation in the form of equipment or retainers for ongoing consultation, or honoraria) 
during the time the clinical investigator is carry ing out the study  and for 1 year after 
completion of the study

12 March 2015Clinical investigator means only  a listed or identified investigator or subinvestigator who is 
directly  involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects.  The term also includes 
the spouse and e ach dependent child of the investigator.  Participating investigators must 
provide this information and complete necessary  documentation as requested by  the sponsor.
The intent of this regulation is to ensure the proper identification and disclosure of fin ancial 
interests of clinical investigators that could affect the reliability  of data submitted to the FDA 
in support of a market application.  Companies must meet these financial disclosure 
requirements, and failure to do so may  result in the refusal by  the FDA to accept an application 
for market approval of the study  drug.
9.5 Changes to the Protocol
No change in the stud y procedures shall be effected without the mutual agreement of the 
sponsor and the investigator.  All changes must be documented as signed pr otocol 
amendments, or as a revised protocol.  Changes to the protocol may  require notification to or 
approval b y the IEC/ IRB and the regulatory  authorities before implementation. L ocal 
regulatory  requirements must be followed.  Instructions for reporting deviations from the 
protocol can be found in the Study  Reference Manual.
The sponsor /designee is responsible for the distribut ion of and training on any protocol 
amendment(s) to the principal investigator(s) and those concerned within the conduct of the 
study.  The principal investigator is responsible for the distribution of all amendments to the 
IEC/ IRB and all staff concerned at his/her study  site.

12 March 2015APPENDIX 1:    CONSIDERATIONS FOR M ANAGEMENT OF NUTRITI ONAL 
SUPPORT DURING THE STUDY
Please consider the following clinical parameters identified as markers for adequate 
management of pediatric short bowel sy ndrome.  These parameters should also be consi dered 
for managing nutritional support (PN/I V and/or oral/ enteral feeding) in terms of volume and 
calories during the treatment period.  
Considerations to adjust nutritional support in volume and calories will be made at all 
planned visits.
Maintaining gr owth (including weight, and head circumferenceand length
,as appropriate) 
by the subjects trending along their growth chart and adjusting calories/volumes to 
maintain the trend.
Other clinical evaluations
oNormal serum electrol ytes
oStable BUN/creatinine lev els
oIncrease in the Volume Intake/Output ratio, including mixed output that can be 
collected
General consideration to possible clinical deterioration in SBS
oAbility  to maintain w eight and growth velocit y
oDiarrhea (> 50 mL/kg/day  with ostomy  or >80mg/kg/day without ostomy )
oColic/vomiting frequency increased
oElectrol yte changes or imbalance
oSkin breakdown (“butt rot”)
Adjustments should be based on the actual nutritional support in volume and calories the 
subject infuses.  Subjects should remain compliant wit h the nutritional support prescription 
in volume and calories during the study .
Nutritional support constituents may  be adjusted at the discretion of the investigator.
During the 72 -hour Intake/Output measurement period prior to y our scheduled visit, no 
further changes to the prescribed nutritional support should be made.
If there is a change in EN/oral fluid intake, the investigator should consider this when 
adjusting the nutritional support in volume and calories
.

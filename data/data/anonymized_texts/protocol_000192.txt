1.2 Synopsis
AbbVie Inc. Protocol Number:   M14-115
Name of Study Drug:   Adalimumab Phase of Development:   3
Name of Active Ingredient:   Adalimumab Date of Protocol Synopsis:   27 November 2018
Protocol Title:   A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind Study to Evaluate Higher Versus Standard 
Adalimumab Dosing Regimens for Induction and Maintenance Therapy in Subjects with Moderately to 
Severely Active Crohn's Disease and Evidence of Mucosal Ulceration
Objectives:
The objective of Study M14-115 is to evaluate efficacy and safety of higher induction and maintenance 
dosing regimens in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.
Investigators:   Multicenter
Study Sites:   Approximately 150 sites worldwide.
Study Population:   Males and females ≥ 18 and ≤  75 years of age with a diagnosis of moderately to 
severely active Crohn's disease, CDAI ≥ 220 and ≤  450, and evidence of mucosal ulceration by Simple 
Endoscopic Score (SES-CD) ≥ 6, excluding the presence of narrowing component, or SES-CD ≥ 4, 
excluding the presence of narrowing component, for patients with disease limited to the ileum, on screening endoscopy (or endoscopy performed within 45 days before Baseline), confirmed by a central reader.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 500 (300 in higher induction regimen group and 
200 in standard induction regimen group) subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's Disease, CDAI of ≥ 220 and ≤  450 and evidence of mucosal ulceration, confirmed by centrally read endoscopy.
Methodology:
This Phase 3 study design includes the Screening Period followed by a 12-Week double-blind Induction 
Study and 44-Week double-blind Maintenance Study.  The Induction Study will assess the efficacy and 
safety of two adalimumab induction regimens in achieving clinical remission, defined as Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) < 150 at Week 4, and endoscopic response, defined as a decrease in Simplified 
Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) > 50% from Baseline (or for a Baseline SES-CD of 4, at least a 2 point reduction from Baseline), as scored by central reviewer, at Week 12; in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and evidence of mucosal ulceration at Baseline.
The Maintenance Study will assess the efficacy and safety of two adalimumab maintenance regimens in 
maintaining clinical and endoscopic improvements at Week 56.  Analyses of the outcomes from the maintenance regimens are considered exploratory.
During both the Induction Study and the Maintenance Study, visit week designations will represent 
weeks since first dose in the Induction Study.  Week 0 (Baseline) will reflect the date of first adalimumab dosing in the Induction Study.  Week 12 will represent the final assessment in the Induction Study.  Week 56 w ill represent the final assessment in the Maintenance Study (representing 44 weeks of 
maintenance treatment in the Maintenance Study).

Methodology (Continued):
Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the 
study and randomized in a 3:2 ratio at Baseline to receive a higher induction adalimumab regimen or standard induction adalimumab regimen during the double-blind Induction Study.  Up to 25% of subjects with previous infliximab exposure may be enrolled.  All subjects who complete the Induction Study (regardless of achievement of response at Week 12) will continue into the Maintenance Study.  Assuming the Week 4 clinical remission rate will be approximately 50% for the higher induction dose regimen and approximately 30% for the standard dose regimen, a sample size of 500 (300 higher dose and 200 standard dose) will be adequate to detect at least a 20% treatment difference in clinical remission rates at Week 4 between the dosing regimens using Fisher's exact test with 99% power at a 0.05 two-sided si gnificant level.
Since exposure/endoscopic relationships are not currently available for adalimumab, clinical remission will be based on PK/PD modeling which predicts an expected ~50% increase in the proportion of subjects with endoscopic response compared to the standard adalimumab induction regimen.  The observed rate of endoscopic response in Study M05-769 was 44% at Week 12 with the currently approved dosing regimen.  Thus, by extrapolation, the expected rate for endoscopic response at Week 12 using the higher induction regimen is 66%.  A sample size of 500 subjects (300 higher induction regimen and 200 standard induction regimen) will be adequate to detect at least a 22% treatment difference in endoscopic response rates at Week 12 between the dosing regimens using Fisher's exact test with approximately 99% power at a 0.05 two-sided significance level.
Since clinical remission at the Week 4 endpoint and the endoscopic response at the Week 12 endpoint are 
not likely to be independent of each other, the power for the co- primary endpoints for the Induction Study 
is expected to be > 98% (see protocol for detailed assumptions of the sample size calculation).
The randomization of subjects for the Induction Study will be stratified by high -sensitivity C-Reactive 
Protein (hs-CRP) at Baseline (< 10 and ≥ 10 mg/L), using the Screening hs-CRP value, prior infliximab 
use, and Crohn's disease activity (CDAI ≤ 300, > 300) at Baseline.  Subjects with prior infliximab 
experience will be limited to 25% of the study population.  Subjects assigned to the higher induction 
regimen will receive blinded adalimumab 160 mg at Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, and Week 3.  At Week 4, subjects will receive adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow) through Week 12.  Subjects assigned to the standard induction regimen will receive blinded adalimumab 160 mg at Baseline and matching placebo at Week 1, adalimumab 80 mg at Week 2 and matching placebo at Week 3.  At Week 4, subjects will receive adalimumab 40 mg every other week through Week 12.
Maintenance Study:
At Week 12, subjects will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two double-blinded exploratory 
treatment regimens (adalimumab clinically adjusted [CA] regimen and adalimumab therapeutic drug monitoring [TDM] regimen).  The re-randomization at Week 12 will be stratified by induction treatment regimen, clinical response (CR-70) status at Week 12 and decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline per the site investigator reading at Week 12.  Among subjects achieving SES-CD > 50% from Baseline at Week 12, the randomization will be further stratified by SES-CD ≤ 4 and at least a 2 point reduction 
versus baseline and no subscore greater than 1 in any individual variable using the Week 12 SES-CD value provided by the site.

Methodology (Continued):
Clinically Adjusted (CA) Regimen:
Subjects randomized to the clinically adjusted regimen will receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week 
beginning at Week 12.  The adalimumab dose will be escalated to every week (ew) as early as Week 14 if the subject's CDAI ≥ 220 or hs-CRP ≥ 10 mg/L (using results from the prior or current visit) as shown by 
the dose adjustment criteria below.  These subjects will also be allowed to escalate at unscheduled visits that may occur only on Weeks 16, 18, 22, 24, 30, 32, 36, 38, 44, 46, 50, 52 and 54.  Once subjects in the clinically adjusted regimen are escalated, they will remain on 40 mg ew dosing.
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) Regimen:
At Weeks 14, 28 and 42, the adalimumab dose for subjects randomized to the TDM will be determined 
by the dose adjustment criteria referenced in the table below.  Doses will be determined using blinded serum concentrations at the prior visit (Weeks 12, 26 and 40, respectively) as well as the CDAI or hs-CRP values from the current or prior visit.  For subjects who meet criteria for dose escalation at Weeks 14, 28 or 42, subjects will receive 40 mg weekly.
The goal of the TDM regimen is to attain and maintain serum adalimumab levels above a reasonably high 
concentration levels in subjects for mucosal healing.  Since exposure-endoscopic relationships are not currently available for adalimumab, clinical remission was used for selection of concentration threshold to be used in TDM arm.  Based on the PK analyses of concentrations in Studies M02-403, M04-691 and M02-433, no concentration level could be identified as significant and reliable predictor of remission in adult CD.  Therefore, the TDM regimen will be based on two concentration thresholds in conjunction with clinical response criteria as expected to occur in clinical setting.  About 75% of the subjects who were in remission at Week 56 in Study M02-433 had serum concentration above 5 μg/mL.  Therefore, the 
lower concentration threshold for the TDM regimen was selected as 5 μg/mL and any subject below 
5μg/mL concentration will be escalated to ew dosing.  The second threshold was selected as 10 μg/mL, 
which is similar to the median concentrations (9.4 μg/mL at Week 56) observed in subjects who were in 
remission.  The subjects with concentration above 5 and below 10 μg/mL may be dose escalated based on 
clinical response as outlined in the table below.  The subjects with serum concentration above 10 μg/mL 
will not be dose escalated.

The duration of the study could be up to 60 weeks which includes a Screening Period (1 – 4 weeks), a 
12-week double-blind Induction Study and a 44-week M aintenance Study.  The Screening Period may be 
extended as necessary after consultation with and approval by the AbbVie Study Designated Physician (SDP) for subjects who require initiation of prophylactic anti-tuberculosis (TB) therapy, or in case of external, not subject-related circumstances (e.g., due to delay of availability of screening test results).  There will also be a 70-day follow-up phone call for subjects who complete Week 56 or discontinue from the study prematurely.
Clinical evaluation will occur at Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 20, 26, 28, 34, 40, 42, 48, and 
56/Premature Discontinuation (PD) visits.  An electronic diary will be dispensed at the Screening visit.  In addition to routine physical examination, CDAI calculation, diary review, laboratory, adverse event, concomitant medication and vital sign assessments, the following will be collected:
!Results of study questionnaires (IBDQ, EQ-5D, WPAI) at Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, 
Week 26, Week 40 and Week 56/PD.
!Calculation of the SFPS at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, Week 14, 
Week 20, Week 26, Week 28, Week 34, Week 40, Week 42, Week 48 and Week 56/PD.  The 
Screening visit results will serve as the Baseline value.
!Results of daily Bristol Stool Form Scale beginning at Baseline through Week 56/PD.
!Results of 11-point Abdominal Pain Rating Scale beginning at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, 
Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, and Week 56/PD.
!Serum for measurement of adalimumab concentrations just prior to dosing at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, and Week 56/PD.

!Stool samples for microbiota metagenomic analyses during Screening, at Week 4, Week 12, Week 26, and Week 56/PD.
!Endoscopic evaluations, confirmed by central reader, will be done at Screening, Week 12, and Week 56/PD.
!An optional pharmacogenetic sample should be drawn at Baseline and Week 12.
Throughout the study, subjects will only be allowed to change the dosage of CD-specific concomitant 
medications as specified below:
!At Week 4, subjects who are taking corticosteroid therapy at Baseline will have their corticosteroid therapy tapered according to a tapering schedule specified in the clinical study protocol.  If the Investigator feels that the steroid taper is not advisable for a particular subject at Week 4, the Study Designated Physician (SDP) should be consulted for evaluation and approval.
!Subjects taking corticosteroids at Baseline who have a loss of satisfactory clinical response per 
the Investigator's judgment after the steroid taper has been initiated may have their corticosteroid dose increased per the Investigator's discretion during the study.  Subjects in whom the maximum equivalent steroid dose exceeds the dose used at Baseline will be censored for efficacy assessments (i.e., they will be considered non-responders for categorical endpoints 
and will have the last non-missing values carried forward for non-categorical assessments) from 
that point forward.  These subjects will continue to be evaluated in the safety population.
!Immunosuppressant doses may be decreased or terminated in the event of moderate-to-severe treatment-related toxicities.

Investigational Products: Adalimumab (40 mg/0.8 mL)
Double-Blind Induction Subjects will be randomized to receive one of 2 double-blind 
adalimumab Induction Study regimens.
Doses: (Higher Induction Regimen)
160 mg at Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, and 3, and 40 mg at Week 4, continuing 
at 40 mg every other week through Week 12.
(Standard Induction Regimen)160 mg at Baseline and matching placebo at Week 1, 80 mg at Week 2 
and matching placebo at Week 3 and 40 mg every other week beginning at Week 4 through Week 12.
Double-Blind Maintenance Subjects will receive one of two double-blind adalimumab Maintenance Study regimens.
Doses:
NOTE:   In order to retain 
blinding across regimens, all 
subjects who do not meet the criteria for dose escalation in either maintenance regimen will receive matching placebo injections in addition to the adalimumab injection.Clinically Adjusted (CA) Regimen:
Subjects randomized to the clinically adjusted regimen will receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week beginning at Week 12.  The adalimumab dose will be escalated to every week starting at Week 14 if CDAI is ≥ 220 or hs-CRP ≥ 10 mg/L (using results from the prior or 
current visit) as shown by the dose adjustment criteria table.  These subjects will also be allowed to escalate at unscheduled visits that may occur only on Weeks 16, 18, 22, 24, 30, 32, 36, 38, 44, 46, 50, 52 and 54.  Once subjects in the clinically adjusted regimen are escalated, they will remain on 40 mg ew dosing.
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) Regimen:
At Weeks 14, 28 and 42, the adalimumab dose for subjects randomized 
to the TDM regimen will be determined by the dose adjustment criteria table.  Doses will be determined using blinded serum concentrations at the prior visit (Weeks 12, 26 and 40, respectively) as well as the CDAI or hs-CRP values from the current or prior visit.  For subjects who meet criteria for dose escalation at Weeks 14, 28 or 42, subjects will receive 40 mg weekly.
Mode of Administration: Subcutaneous (SC)
Duration of Treatment:
The study will include a Screening Period of 1 – 4 weeks, a double-blind Induction Study of 12 weeks,
and a double-blind Maintenance Study of 44 weeks.  There will also be a 70 -day follow-up phone call for 
subjects who complete the study or discontinue from the study prematurely.

M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
18
Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
All endpoints for the Exploratory Maintenance Study will be non-ranked. 
Pharmacokinetic:
Blood samples will be collected for measurement of serum adalimumab concentration just prior to dosing 
at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, and Week 56/Premature Discontinuation and anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) just prior to dosing at Baseline, Week 4, Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, and Week 56PD.
Blood samples will also be collected for measurement of infliximab serum levels and Human 
Anti-Chimeric Antibodies (HACA) just prior to dosing at Baseline.
Exploratory Research Using Intestinal Mucosal Biopsy Samples (Optional):
Optional intestinal biopsies will be collected with consent at Screening, Week 12, and Week 56 or at 
premature discontinuation.  The purpose of these samples is to test potential biomarker signatures and new drug targets for IBD.  Assessments will include but may not be limited to nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites or lipids.
Safety:
Safety analyses will be performed on all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.  Incidence 
of adverse events, changes in vital signs, physical examination results, and clinical laboratory data will be assessed.
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
The co-primary efficacy variables for the Induction Study are proportion of subjects with moderately to 
severely active CD that have achieved clinical remission, defined as CDAI < 150, at Week 4 and 
proportion of subjects with moderately to severely active CD that have achieved a decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline (or for a Baseline SES-CD of 4, at least a 2 point reduction from Baseline), at Week 12. The co mparison between treatment groups for the two co-primary efficacy variables will be 
performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test and will be stratified by hs-CRP at Baseline (< 10 and ≥ 10 mg/L) (the Screening hs-CRP will serve as the Baseline value), prior infliximab use, and 
Crohn's disease severity (CDAI ≤ 300, > 300) at Baseline.  A CMH based two-sided 95% confidence 
interval for the difference between treatment groups will be calculated.  The ITT set includes all subjects who were randomized at baseline.  For the evaluation of co-primary endpoints, missing data of CDAI at Week 4 or missing SES-CD at Week 12 will be imputed using the non-responder imputation (NRI) 
approach.  For Week 4 clinical remission, LOCF, OC and multiple imputation methods will be used as sensitivity analyses.  For Week 12 endoscopic response (decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline [or for a Baseline SES-CD of 4, at least a 2 point reduction from Baseline]), OC will be used as sensitivity analysis.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Efficacy (Continued):
Secondary efficacy variables for the Induction Study are divided into two groups.  The first group 
includes ranked secondary endpoints, which are ranked by clinical importance.  Statistical significance is assessed at significance level of 0.050 (2-sided) in ranked endpoint order until the significance level exceeds 0.05.  No additional statistically significant treatment differences may be declared after the first ranked endpoint fails to achieve statistical significance at a two-sided significance level of 0.05.  The second group includes all other secondary variables.
In general, continuous secondary efficacy variables, including all ef ficacy variables for Maintenance 
Study, will be analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model including factor for treatment 
group, stratification factors and Baseline values, whereas CMH test stratified by stratification factors is used for categorical endpoints.  NRI for missing data will be used for categorical endpoints.  Both last observation carried forward (LOCF) and observed case (OC) analyses will be performed for continuous endpoints.  The LOCF analysis is considered primary for inferential purposes.  In addition, Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) will be applied, wherever appropriate, as a sensitivity analysis for the longitudinal continuous endpoints.
Pharmacokinetic:
Adalimumab trough serum concentrations will be summarized by treatment group at each time point 
using descriptive statistics.  In addition, pharmacokinetic model based analyses will be performed with the focus on apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of adalimumab.
Immunogenicity:AAA will be evaluated for each subject and each regimen, and rates of AAA positive will be calculated.  
As appropriate, the effect of AAA on adalimumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy variable(s), and treatment emergent adverse events may be evaluated.
Safety:
Adverse events (AEs), laboratory data and vital signs are the primary safety parameters in this study.  All 
safety comparisons will be performed between treatment groups using the safety set.  Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as events that begin or worsen either on or after the first dose of the study drug and within 70 days after the last dose of the study drug for subjects who do not participate in the OLE or until first dose of study drug in the OLE study if the subject is a study completer and is enrolled in the OLE.  Treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized separately for:  a) Baseline to Week 12; b) Week 12 to Week 56; c) Baseline to Week 56 (overall study duration).  An overview of 
treatment-emergent AEs, including AEs of special interest, adverse events leading to death and adverse events leading to premature discontinuation (see details in the SAP), AEs by Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version 20.1 or later) preferred term and system organ class, AEs by maximum relationship to study drug, and AEs by maximum severity will be summarized by number and percentage.  
Changes in laboratory data will be described using statistical characteristics and compared 
between-treatment groups will be performed using a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).  In addition, shift tables and listings will be provided for abnormal values, whereby the normal range of the analyzing laboratory will be used.  Vital signs will be analyzed similarly.

3.0 Introduction
Crohn's disease encompasses a spectrum of clinical and pathological processes manifested 
by focal asymmetric, transmural, and occas ionally granulomatous inflammation that can 
affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract.1  The disease can affect persons of any 
age, and its onset is most common in the second and third decades.  Females are affected slightly more than males, and the risk for disease is higher in some ethnic groups.
2,3  In 
North America, the incidence of CD is estimated to be 3.1 to 14.6 cases per 100,000 persons.
2  Prevalence rates range from 26 to 99 cases per 100,000 persons.  In Europe, CD 
has an incidence of 0.7 to 9.8 cases per 100,000 persons and a prevalence of 8.3 to 214 cases per 100,000 persons.
2
Traditionally, therapy for CD has been focused on symptomatic improvement and achievement of clinical remission as measured using the CDAI.  In addition to improving symptoms, an emerging goal of therapy is to improve the condition of the intestinal mucosa.  It has been shown that patients with endoscopic evidence of ulceration of the gastrointestinal mucosa are at increased risk of experiencing a complicated disease 
course.
4  Therefore, it is reasonable that another goal of therapy be improvement of the 
intestinal mucosal as visualized on endoscopy; as this has been found to be associated with positive clinical benefits, including higher rates of clinical remission, fewer hospitalizations, and fewer abdominal surgeries.
5,6  In addition, at the 2012 United States 
(US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -sponsored Gastroenterology Regulatory 
Endpoints and the Advancement of Therapeutics (GREAT) Workshop, there was significant discussion on the use of endoscopy to support determination of disease activity, as oppos ed to using symptomatic improvements alone.  However, improvement 
of the appearance of the intestinal mucosa may be more difficult to achieve than symptomatic improvement alone as it requires reducing the extent of mucosal ulceration.  A new endpoint for efficacy of therapy was discussed at the Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD); the achievement of mucosal remission measured as SES-CD of ≤ 2.0.
9  This endpoint was added to the Induction Study and as an 
exploratory endpoint in the Maintenance study.

Comparison of various efficacy endpoints assessed in the EXTEND study 
(Study M05-769) suggests that when raising the efficacy standard from one that is driven by symptoms to one that is more objective (i.e., assessment of improvement in the condition of the intestinal mucosa), there is an overall decrease in both efficacy rate and effect size for adalimumab.

a. Defined as CDAI < 150.
b. Defined as absence of mucosal ulceration as confirmed by central reader's visual assessment of the 
ileocolonoscopy.
Note: Four patients randomized to placebo and 2 patients randomized to ADA were excluded from the mucosal 
healing analysis as they had absence of mucosal ulceration at screening (as judged by the review committee).
Exposure-response analyses based on adalimumab trough serum concentration and 
Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI)-based efficacy (remission, CR-70 and CR-100) at Week 4 conducted with data from previous adalimumab induction studies (CLASSIC [Study M02-403] and GAIN [Study M04-691]) have shown that higher Week 4 efficacy 
rates corresponded to higher adalimumab trough serum concentrations in both anti-TNF naïve and anti-TNF experienced subjects.  Therefore, to improve the likelihood of achieving more stringent efficacy endpoints, such as endoscopic improvement of the intestinal mucosa, more intensive treatment with adalimumab may be required.
For the reasons described above, this study is designed to investigate the efficacy and 
safety of two adalimumab induction regimens (higher and standard) in adult subjects with moderately to severely active CD and evidence of mucosal ulceration.  Additionally, the study will evaluate the sustained efficacy of the standard maintenance therapy of 40 mg adalimumab dosing every other week with subjects whose dosing is either guided by trough adalimumab concentrations (Therapeutic Drug Monitoring regimen) or by clinical assessment without adalimumab concentrations (Clinically Adjusted regimen).

3.1 Differences Statement
The primary difference between Study M14-115 and the other CD studies, are the 
inclusion of subjects with evidence of mucosal ulceration defined as SES-CD ≥ 6, 
excluding the presence of narrowing component, or SES-CD ≥4, excluding the presence 
of narrowing component, for patients with disease limited to the ileum on screening endoscopy or endoscopy performed within 45 days before Baseline, confirmed by a central reader.  Subjects would be required to have presence of ulceration confirmed by 
central reader prior to Baseline.  An addition al difference is the inclusion of an induction 
regimen higher than has previously been studied in CD in the 12 week Induction Study.  For the first time in a blinded study, the Maintenance Study of this protocol presents the option to adjust adalimumab dosing from eow to ew based on trough adalimumab concentrations as compared to adjustment based on clinical assessment of hs-CRP and CDAI.  
3.2 Benefits and Risks
Extensive clinical and post marketing experience exists with adalimumab in a wide range 
of disease states including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC).  The safety profile of adalimumab in those indications is well-established with more than 50,000 p atient-years of adalimumab clinical trial experience.  The clinical studies in adult 
CD have not altered this safety profile and demonstrated a positive benefit/risk balance.  Conditions which may present a risk specifically  for patients with CD are exclusion 
criteria in this study (e.g., evidence of current colonic dysplasia or active infections).
3.3 Adalimumab Overview
Adalimumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin (IgG1) monoclonal antibody 
containing only human peptide sequences.  Adalimumab is produced by recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology in a mammalian cell expression system.  It consists of 1,330 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kilodaltons.  Adalimumab is composed of fully human heavy and light chain variable regions, which confer specificity to human tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and human IgG1 
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
31
heavy chain and kappa light chain sequences.  Adalimumab binds with high affinity and 
specificity to soluble TNF- α but not to lymphotoxin- α (TNF-β).
TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and 
immune responses.  Elevated levels of TNF play an important role in pathologic inflammation.  Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralizes the biological function of TNF by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.  Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF.  After treatment with adalimumab, levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-Reactive Protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and serum cytokines rapidly decrease.
Adalimumab was first approved in US and EU for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) in 2002 and 2003, respectively.  Additional indications have been approved in the US and EU including psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondylitis, Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis, polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, pediatric Crohn's Disease, pediatric psoriasis as well as pediatric enthesitis related arthritis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis in EU only and intestinal Beçhet's Disease in Japan.  Additional updates regarding approved indications can be found in the current edition of the Humira Investigational Drug Brochure.
3.4 Safety information
Adalimumab therapy has a well-established and well described safety profile in adults 
based on extensive post marketing experience and continued clinical trial patient exposure since the first approved indication in 2002 for rheumatoid arthritis.  A detailed discussion of the pre-clinical toxicology, metabolism, pharmacology and safety experience with adalimumab can be found in the current Investigator's Brochure.  AbbVie is committed to continue to collect safety information including those events that may occur in this trial in order to confirm this established safety profile and to identify any unknown potential 
adverse reactions, rare events and those events with a long latency.  AbbVie is participating in a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-requested, TNF inhibitor class

wide exploration of the rare appearance of malignancy in patients who are 30 years of age 
or younger at the time of diagnosis.  The risk of malignancy in this age group has not been established and is difficult to study due to its rarity.  AbbVie appreciates your attention to 
the additional reporting requirements needed  in this unlikely event, outlined in 
Section 6.1.5 under Adverse Event Reporting.
4.0 Study Objective
The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of two adalimumab induction regimens in achieving clinical remission (CDAI < 150) at Week 4 and endoscopic response defined as decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline (or for a Baseline SES-CD of 4, at least a 2 point reduction from Baseline) at Week 12, in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and evidence of mucosal ulceration at Baseline.
Additional objectives include:
●Assessing the efficacy and safety of two adalimumab induction regimens in 
reducing signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease at Week 12.
●Assessing the efficacy and safety of two adalimumab maintenance regimens in reducing signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease at Week 56.
●Assessing pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of two adalimumab 
induction regimens following subcutaneous (SC) administration.
5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a randomized, double-blind multicenter  study of two adalimumab induction and 
maintenance regimens in subjects with moderately to severely active CD with evidence of 
mucosal ulceration confirmed by central reading.  No placebo arm is planned since there is well-documented efficacy of adalimumab in CD and because the purpose of this study is to achieve better efficacy than the standard induction and maintenance regimens in 
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
33
terms of clinical remission and endoscopic response.  Additionally, since subjects will be 
required to have failed or been intolerant of standard therapies and have evidence of endoscopic damage confirmed by a central reader, it would be not medically acceptable to deny those subjects effective treatment or feasible to enroll subjects in the trial when adalimumab is available to be prescribed for CD.
Approximately 500 adult subjects with active Crohn 's disease, defined as having a CDAI 
of ≥ 220 and ≤ 450 and evidence of mucosal ulceration defined as SES-CD ≥ 6, excluding 
the presence of narrowing component, or SES-CD ≥ 4, excluding the presence of 
narrowing component, for patients with disease limited to the ileum on screening 
endoscopy or endoscopy performed within 45 days before Baseline, confirmed by a centrally read endoscopy, will be e nrolled at approximately 150 sites worldwide.
Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study and randomized in a 3:2 ratio at Baseline to receive a higher induction adalimumab regimen or standard induction adalimumab regimen during the double-blind Induction Study.  Assuming the Week 4 clinical remission rate will be 
approximately 50% for the higher induction dose regimen and approximately 30% for the 
standard dose regimen, a sample size of 500 (300 higher dose and 200 standard dose) will be adequate to detect at least a 20% treatment difference in clinical remission rates at Week 4 between the dosing regimens using Fisher's exact test with 99% power at a 0.05 two-sided significant level.
Since exposure/endoscopic relationships are not currently available for adalimumab, 
clinical remission will be based on PK/PD modeling which predicts an expected ~50% increase in the proportion of subjects with endoscopic response compared to the standard adalimumab induction regimen.  The observed rate of endoscopic response (decrease > 50% SES-CD from Baseline [or for a Baseline SES-CD of 4, at least a 2 point reduction from Baseline]) in Study M05-769 was 44% at Week 12 with the currently approved 
dosing regimen.  Thus, by extrapolation, the expected rate for endoscopic response at Week 12 using the higher induction regimen is 66%.  A sample size of 500 subjects (300 higher induction regimen and 200 standard induction regimen) will be adequate to 
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
34
detect at least a 22% treatment difference in endoscopic response (decrease >50% SES-
CD from Baseline [or for a Baseline SES-CD of 4, at least a 2 point reduction from Baseline]) rates at Week 12 between the dosing regimens using Fisher's exact test with approximately 99% power at a 0.05 tw o-sided significance level.
Since the clinical remission at Week 4 endpoint and the endoscopic response at Week 12 endpoint are likely not independent of each other, the power for the co-primary endpoints for the study is expected to be > 98% (see Section 8.2for detailed assumptions of the 
sample size calculation).
The randomization of sub jects for the Induction Study will be stratified by hs-CRP at 
Baseline (< 10 and ≥ 10 mg/L), using the Screening hs-CRP value, prior infliximab use, 
and Crohn's disease activity (CDAI ≤ 300, > 300), at Baseline.  Enrollment of subjects 
with prior infliximab use will be limit ed to 25% of the to tal study population.
Subjects assigned to the higher induction regimen will receive blinded adalimumab 
160 mg at Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, and Week 3.  At Week 4, subjects will receive 40 mg every other week (eow) through Week 12.  Subjects assigned to the standard adalimumab induction regimen will receive blinded adalimumab 160 mg at Baseline and matching placebo at Week 1.  Subjects will receive 80 mg and matching placebo at Week 2, and then matching placebo at Week 3.  At Week 4, subjects will receive 40 mg every other week through Week 12.
At Week 12, subjects will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two double-
blinded exploratory treatment regimens (adalimumab clinically adjusted [CA] regimen and adalimumab therapeutic drug monitoring [TDM] regimen).  The re-randomization at Week 12 will be stratified by induction treatment regimen, clinical response (CR-70) status at Week 12 and decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline per the site investigator 
reading at Week 12.  Among subjects achieving SES-CD > 50% from Baseline at Week 12, the randomization will be further strati fied by achievement of an SES-CD ≤ 4 
and at least a 2 point reduction versus Baseline and no subscore greater than 1 in any 
Adalimumab

35
individual variable using the Week 12 SES-CD value provided by the site.  No study drug 
will be administered or injected at the final visit.
Clinically Adjusted (CA) Regimen:Subjects randomized to the clinically adjusted regimen will receive 40 mg adalimumab 
every other week beginning at Week 12.  The adalimumab dose will be escalated to every week starting as early as Week 14 if the subject's CDAI is ≥ 220 or hs-CRP ≥10 mg/L 
(using results from the prior or current visit ).  These subjects will also be allowed to 
escalate at unscheduled visits that may occur only on Weeks 16, 18, 22, 24, 30, 32, 36, 38, 44, 46, 50, 52 and 54.  Once subjects in the CA regimen are escalated, they will remain on 40 mg ew dosing.
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) Regimen:At Weeks 14, 28 and 42, the adalimumab dose for subjects randomized to the TDM will 
be determined by the dose adjustment criteria table ( Table 2 ).  Doses will be determined 
using blinded serum concentrations at the prior visit (Weeks 12, 26 and 40, respectively) as well as the CDAI or hs-CRP values from the current or prior visit.  For subjects who meet criteria for dose escalation at Weeks 14, 28 or 42, subjects will receive 40 mg weekly.

The duration of the study could be up to 60 weeks which includes a Screening Period
(1 – 4 weeks, ± 3 days which is granted around all study visits), a 12 week double-blind 
period Induction Study, and a double-blind 44-w eek Maintenance Study.  The Screening 
Period may be extended as necessary after consultation and approval with the AbbVie Study Designated Physician (SDP) for subjects who require initiation of prophylactic anti-tuberculosis (TB) therapy, or in case of external, not subject-related circumstances 
(e.g., due to delay of availability of screening test results).  There will also be a 70-day 
follow-up phone call for subjects who complete Week 56 or discontinue from the study 
prematurely.

28, 34, 40, 42, 48, and 56/PD.  An electronic diary will be dispensed at the Screening 
visit.  In addition to routine physical examination, CDAI calculation, diary review, laboratory, adverse event, concomitant medication and vital sign assessments, the following will be collected:
●Results of study questionnaires (inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire 
[IBDQ], European Quality of Life 5 dimensions [EQ-5D], work productivity 
and impairment [WPAI]) at Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 26, 
Week 40 and Week 56/PD.
●Calculation of the SFPS at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, 
Week 12, Week 14, Week 20, Week 26, Week 28, Week 34, Week 40, Week 42, Week 48 and Week 56/PD.  The Screening results will serve as the 
Baseline value.
●Results of daily Bristol Stool F orm Scale beginning at Baseline through 
Week 56/PD.
●Results of 11-point Abdominal Pain Rating Scale beginning at Baseline, 
Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, and 
Week 56/PD.

●Serum for measurement of adalimumab concentrations just prior to dosing at 
Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, 
and Week 56/PD.
●Serum for measurement of Anti-Adalimumab Antibodies (AAA) just prior to dosing at Baseline, Week 4, Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, and Week 56/PD.
●Serum for measurement of infliximab serum levels and Human Anti-Chimeric Antibodies (HACA) just prior to dosing at Baseline.
●Serological biomarkers/mRNA at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8,Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, and Week 56/PD.
●Stool samples for analysis of fecal calprotectin during Screening, at Week 4, 
Week 12, Week 26, and Week 56/PD.
●Stool samples for microbiota metagenomic analyses during Screening, at Week 4, Week 12, Week 26, and Week 56/PD.  The stool samples should be 
taken before starting bowel preparations for endoscopy.
●Endoscopic evaluations, eligibility confir med by central reader, will be done at 
Screening, Week 12, and Week 56/PD.
●An optional pharmacogenetic sample should be drawn at Baseline and Week 12.
Throughout the study, subjects will only be allowed to change the dosage of CD-specific 
concomitant medications as specified below:
●At Week 4, subjects who are taking corticosteroid therapy at Baseline will 
have their corticosteroid therapy tapered according to a tapering schedule specified in the clinical study protocol.  If the Investigator feels that the steroid 
taper is not advisable for a particular subject at Week 4, the Study Designated 
Physician (SDP) should be consulted for evaluation and approval.
●Subjects taking corticosteroids at Baseline who have a loss of satisfactory clinical response per the Investigator's judgment after the steroid taper has 
been initiated may have their corticosteroid dose increased per the 
Investigator's discretion during the study .  Subjects in whom the maximum 
steroid dose equivalent exceeds the dose used at Baseline will be censored for 
efficacy assessments (i.e., will be considered non-responders for categorical 
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
40
endpoints and will have the last non-missing values carried forward for non-
categorical assessments) from that point forward.  These subjects will continue 
to be evaluated in the safety  population.
●Immunosuppressant doses may be decreased or terminated in the event of moderate-to-severe treatment-related toxicities.
The study was designed to enroll 500 subjects to meet scientific and regulatory objectives 
without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.  Therefore, if the target number of subjects has been enrolled, there is a possibility that additional subjects in screening will not be enrolled.
Re-Screening
Subjects that initially screen fail for the study may be permitted to re-screen following 
re-consent.  All screening procedures with the possible exceptions noted below will be 
repeated.  The subject must meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria at the time of re-screening in order to qualify for the study.  There is no minimum period of time 
a subject must wait to re-screen for the study.  If the subject had a complete init ial 
screening evaluation including the assessment of a purified protein derivative (PPD) test (or equivalent), or Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA; QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test or T SPOT TB test) chest x-ray (if applicable) and electrocardiogram (ECG), these tests will not be required to be repeated for re-screening provided the conditions noted in Section 5.3.1.1 are met and no more than 90 days have passed.  If an endoscopy 
was performed, this will not be required to be repeated for re-screening provided the conditions noted in Section 5.3.1.1 are met and no more than 45 days have passed 
between the endoscopy date and the Baseline date.  As appropriate, sites are encouraged to contact the AbbVie Study Designated Physician  (SDP) to confirm if subjects should or 
should not be re-screened.
Subjects may discontinue adalimumab treatment at any time during study participation.  
Subjects that end study participation early will have a Premature Discontinuation Visit.  All subjects who discontinue from the study prematurely will have a follow-up phone call 
Adalimumab

41
approximately 70 days after the last administration of study drug to obtain information on 
any new or ongoing adverse events (AEs).  The 70-day follow-up phone call will not be required for any subject that initiates commercial adalimumab.

5.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
5.2.3.1 Prior Therapy
Any non CD-r elated med ication or vaccine (including over-the-counter or prescription 
medicines, vitamins and/or herbal supplements) that the subject has received within 
30 days prior to Baseline, is receiving at the time of enrollment, or receives during the study, must be recorded along with the reason for use, date(s) of administration including start and end dates, and dosage information including dose, route and frequency on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF).
Crohn's disease specific medications (including but not limited to corticosteroids, 
aminosalicylates, immunosuppressant agents, and CD-related antibiotics) that the subject has received within 90 days of Baseline s hould be recorded on the appropriate page of the 
eCRF and should include the dates of administration and dosages.  Antibiotics taken for any reason other than Crohn's disease within 90 days of Baseline should be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF and should include the reason for use, dates of administration and dosages.
Subjects who failed to respond to corticosteroids or immunosuppressants (azathioprine, 
6-MP or MTX) within the past 1 year require a confirmed documentation of failure.  The dates (start and end dates) of the most recent course of treatment and the maximum daily dosage of the most recent course of treatment and reasons for discontinuation is to be recorded in the appropriate eCRF.  In addition the highest known dose taken within the past 1 year will be recorded.  For subjects who were intolerant to treatment with corticosteroids or immunosuppressants (azathioprine, 6-MP or MTX) within the past 5 years confirmed documentation of intolerance is required.  The highest known dose taken will be recorded in appropriate eCRF.
Subjects who previously experienced a benefit from infliximab and discontinued its use 
due to a subsequent loss of response (judged by the Investigator to have responded to infliximab in the past and subsequently experienced an overall lack of improvement or worsening of CD related symptoms) or intolerance (in the opinion of the investigator 
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
51
therapy was discontinued as a result of a significant acute or delayed 
infusion/administration reaction to the medicat ion) to the agent will have the highest 
known dose taken recorded in the appropriate eCRF ( Appendix K ).
In addition, for subjects age ≤ 30 with a reported malignancy adverse event, prior 
exposure to, or current use of, antineoplastics, or other drugs which have a risk of malignancy as stated in their label and other relevant dosing information to estimate total exposure will be collected in the source documents and appropriate eCRF pages.  At the time of the reported malignancy adverse event, sites will be asked if any of the prior and concomitant medications contributed to the ev ent.  Any medications used prior to the 
study will be captured on the appropriate eCRF.  Information on the reason for use, date(s) of administration including start and end dates, highest maintained dose, dosage information including dose, route and frequency, and reason for stopping the medication will be collected in the source doc uments and appropriate eCRF pages.
The AbbVie study designated physician identified in Section 6.1.5 should be contacted if 
there are any questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy(ies).
5.2.3.2 Concomitant Therapy
Doses of immunosuppressants (including but not limited to) azathioprine, 6-MP, and 
methotrexate and aminosalicylates taken at Baseline will be continued.  Doses must remain stable throughout the duration of the st udy.  Doses may be decreased or terminated 
in the event of treatment-related toxicities (e.g., leukopenia or elevated liver enzymes) considered moderate to severe in the opinion of the investigator.
Doses of Crohn's disease related antibiotics taken at Baseline will be continued.  Change 
in dose of Crohn's disease related antibiotics during the study will not be allowed except for treatment related toxicities or concerns about development of antibiotic resistance.  
Newly prescribed CD related antibiotics is not allowed during the study.
Doses of corticosteroids taken at Baseline, as outlined in inclusion criterion 4 in 
Section 5.2.1 , will be continued.  Subjects are not allowed to change the corticosteroid 
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
52
dose during the first 4 weeks of the study except in the event of treatment-related 
toxicities considered moderate to severe in  the opinion of the Investigator.  At Week 4, all 
subjects who are taking corticosteroid therapy at Baseline will have their corticosteroid therapy tapered according to a tapering schedule specified below and in Section 5.3.1.1 .
If the Investigator feels that the steroid taper is not advisable for a particular subject at Week 4, the SDP should be consulted for evaluation and approval.
A proposed regimen to taper prednisone dose starts with a weekly decrease by 5 mg/day 
prednisone (or equivalent) for doses > 10 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent) until a 10 mg/day (or equivalent) dose is reached, then a weekly decrease by 2.5 mg/day (or equivalent) until discontinuation.  A proposed regimen to taper budesonide dose starts with a weekly decrease by 3 mg/day budesonide until discontinuation.
Subjects taking corticosteroids at Baseline who have a loss of satisfactory clinical 
response per the Investigator's judgment after the steroid taper ha s been initiated may 
have their corticosteroid dose increased per the Investigator's discretion during the study.  Subjects in whom the maximum equivalent steroid dose exceeds the dose used at Baseline will be censored for efficacy assessments (i.e., they will be considered non-responders for categorical endpoints and will have the last non-missing values carried forward for non-categorical assessments) from that point forward.  These subjects will continue to be evaluated in the safety population.  In addition, sub jects in whom the CD-related 
corticosteroids that were not being taken at Baseline and are initiated during the study will be censored for efficacy assessments (i.e., th ey will be considered non-responders for 
categorical endpoints and will have the last non-missing values carried forward for non-categorical assessments) from that point forward.  These subjects will continue to be evaluated in the safety population.
Subjects may not be on both budesonide and prednisone (or equivalent) simultaneously.
Subjects who enter the study on probiotics ma y continue this therapy provided doses 
remain stable from Baseline throughout the duration of the study.
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33

Subjects in whom the following CD-rel ated medications (oral or rectal aminosalicylates, 
thiopurines and MTX) that were not being taken at Baseline and are initiated during the 
study or who have dosages of these medications increased to greater than the dose taken at Baseline is prohibited during the study, except in the event of moderate-to-severe treatment related toxicities and after discussion with the AbbVie TA MD.
Changes in all concomitant medications will be assessed at each study visit from Baseline 
(Week 0) through Week 56/PD Visits.  Any changes will be documented in the source documents and captured on the appropriate eCRF page.
The AbbVie Study Designated Physician identified in Section 6.1.5 should be contacted if 
there are any questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy(ies).

a. The Screening period will be a minimum of 7 days for CDAI calculation.  The CDAI calculated at Screening will serve as the Baseline CDAI.  Baseline visit date will serve 
as the reference for all subsequent visits.  A ± 3-day window is permitted around all study visits.
b. Update inclusion/exclusion, prior and concomitant therapy, and medical/surgical history information to assure subject eligibi lity.
c. Height will be measured at Screening only (with shoes off, and then adding 1 inch or 2.5cm).
d. An ileocolonoscopy will be performed during Screening or one performed within 45 days before Baseline, Week 12, and at Week 5 6/PD.  A biopsy will be performed at 
Screening, Week 12, and Week 56/PD if a suspicious lesion or suspected malignancy, in the assessment of the Investigator, is observed, and evaluated by the local 
pathologist.  Site staff should schedule the Week 12 Endoscopy during the Baseline visit, if possible.  Appropriate documentati on of biopsy results consistent with the 
diagnosis of CD, in the assessment of the Investigator, must be available in order to confirm the subject's eligibility for the  study.  If this documentation is not available, a 
diagnostic biopsy from the most affected observed area of the ileum/colon must be performed during the Screening endoscopy and evaluated by a qualified local pathologist and the results reviewed by the Investigator.  Biopsies to evaluate suspicious lesions and to rule out malignancy may be taken during any study endoscopy per the 
Investigator's discretion and evaluated by the local pathologist.

Table 3. Study Activities (Continued)
e. Physical examination performed at Screening, Week 12 and Week 56/Premature Discontinuation Visits are full physical examinati ons which must include an assessment of 
extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs) and a count of the number of cutaneous fistulas.  Physical examinations at all other vis its are symptom based and must include a count 
of the number of cutaneous fistulas.
f. Subjects with negative PPD test and/or QuantiFERON-TB Gold test within 90 days of Screening will not require a repeat skin te st, if documentation is available.  PPD skin 
test is to be read 48 to 72 hours after placement.
g. Chest x-ray includes posterior-anterior (PA) andlateral views.  Subjects with normal chest x-ray within 3 months of Screening would not require a repeat chest x-ray, if 
documentation is available.
h. Subjects with normal ECG within 90 days of Screening would not require a repeat ECG, if documentation is available.
i. Lab assessments will only need to be repeated at Baseline if the time between Screening and Baseline is greater than 14 days, or if the subject's health status has changed to 
warrant a repeat test.
j. Dipstick urinalysis will be completed by the sites at all required visits.  A microscopic analysis will be performed by the c entral laboratory, in the event the dipstick results 
show protein, ketones or blood greater than negative or glucose greater than normal.  Further explanations of these tests are p rovided in the laboratory manual.
k. Serum pregnancy test will be performed on all women of childbearing potential at Screening.  Urine pregnancy test will be per formed locally at Baseline Visit, and at the 
Week 12 and Week 56/PD for all women of child-bearing potential.  The frequency can be increased up to every visit as per local  regulations.  If any urine pregnancy test is 
positive, a serum pregnancy test will be performed by the central laboratory.
l. Subjects will be tested for the presence of the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) at Screening.  A positive result for the Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag) will be exclusionary.  
Please refer to hepatitis procedures for details on testing requirements.  If required by country regulatory authorities to confirm eligibility, subjects will be tested for HIV and 
documented that the test has been performed.  This testing is to be done at a local laboratory.  A subject will not be eligible  for study participation if test results indicate a 
positive HIV infection.  AbbVie will not receive results from the testing and not be made aware of any positive result.
m. Anti-dsDNA performed if ANA result is positive.
n. If a sample cannot be obtained during the site visit, the site will give instructions and a stool sample supply kit (supplies  will be provided at the time points indicated).  The 
stool from which these samples are prepared should be scored using the Bristol stool chart by ePRO.  All stool samples for meta genomic analysis should be collected before 
any bowel preparation for endoscopy is started and should be returned to the site within 3 days of collection.
Note: The Screening stool sample may be taken anytime during the Screening period but should be collected prior to any bowel prep .
o. Blood samples for the measurement of adalimumab and AAA concentrations will be collected prior to dosing.  Testing of the adalimumab and AAA concentrations must not 
be performed locally.  All pharmacokinetic results will remain blinded to the investigator, study site personnel and the subject  throughout the study.

5.3.1.1 Study Procedures
The following study procedures are identica l for the Induction Study  (Weeks 0 – 12) and 
the Maintenance Study (Weeks 12 – 56).  The study procedures outlined in Table 3 are 
discussed in detail in this section, with the exception of drug concentration measurements 
and antibody measurements (discussed in Section 5.3.2 ), pharmacogenetic and serologic 
marker/mRNA samples (discussed in Section 5.3.1.2 and Section 5.3.6.2 respectively), 
pharmacokinetics (discussed in Section 5.3.2 ) and the collection of adverse event (AE) 
information (discussed in Section 6.1.4 ).  All study data will be recorded in source 
documents and on the appropriate eCRFs.
Informed Consent
At the Screening visit, the subject will sign and date a study specific, Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC)/Independent Review Board (IRB) approved, informed consent form before any study procedures are performed or any medications are withheld from the subject in order to participate in this study.  Details regarding how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3.  Consent will be required for any 
optional testing.
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Subjects will be evaluated to ensure they meet all inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria at both the Screening and Baseline Visits.Medical, Surgical, and Medication History
A complete medical and surgical history, as well as  a history of tobacco and alcohol use, 
will be obtained from each subject during the Screening Period.  An updated medical 
history will be obtained at the Baseline Visit to ensure that the subject still qualifies.
The location of the subject's Crohn's disease should be recorded in the source documents 
and on the appropriate eCRFs (anal, perianal, rectum, gastroduodenal, ileum, colon, 
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
62
and/or jejunum).  History  should also include onset date, and history of complications 
related to the disease.
Prior azathioprine or 6-MP use or methotrexate (since birth) will be asked.  If subjects 
have/had ever treated with azathioprine or 6-MP or methotrexate, the duration of therapy, 
maximum dose, reason for use and reason(s) for termination of treatment with azathioprine and/or 6-MP and/or methotrexate will be recorded in appropriated eCRF.
A detailed medical history with respect to Loss of Response and/or Intolerance to 
infliximab must be documented in the subject's source documents.  Documentation must include the investigator's judgment based on the conditions defined in Appendix K .
A detailed medical history with respect to TB exposure needs to be documented.  This information needs to include Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination, cohabitation with individuals who have had TB, and/or who reside or work in TB endemic locations.
Physical Examination
A full physical examination will be performed at Screening, Week 12 and 
Week 56/Premature Discontinuation Visits and must include an assessment of extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs) and a count of the number of cutaneous fistulas as in Table 3 .  All other visits are symptom based but must include a count of the number of 
cutaneous fistulas.  A count of the number of cutaneous fistulas draining upon gentle compression will be performed during each physical exam.  Fistulas will be classified as abdominal or perianal/anal.  Physical exam  abnormalities noted by the investigator at 
Baseline (including fistulas and fissures) will be recorded in the subject's medical history.
Abnormalities noted after th e Baseline visit will be evaluated and documented by the 
investigator as to whether they are AEs.Additionally physical examination findings that are related to or part of each subject's 
medical history will be captured on the appropriate medical history eCRFs.

Vital Signs
Vital sign determinations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in sitting position, pulse 
rate, respiratory rate, body weight, and body temperature will be obtained at each visit.  Blood pressure, pulse rate and respiratory rate should be performed before blood draws are performed.  Height will be measured at th e Screening Visit only (with shoes off, and 
then adding 1 inch or 2.5 cm).  All measurements will be recorded in metric units if possible.
12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A resting 12-lead ECG will be performed at the designated study visits in Table 3 .  A 
qualified physician will interpret the clinical significance of any abnormal finding, sign, 
and date each ECG.  Any clinically significant findings will be documented in the source documents and later transcribed on to the appropriate eCRF.  Each signed original ECG will be monitored by the responsible CRA and kept with subject's source documents onsite.
For subjects with a normal ECG taken within 90 days of Screening, a repeat ECG at 
Screening will not be required, provided all protocol required documentation is available.  If there are other findings that are clinically significant, the Principal Investigator must contact the SDP before enrolling the subject.
Subjects can have a repeat ECG at any time during the study as warranted based on the 
opinion of the Investigator.
Chest X-Ray (CXR)
All subjects will undergo a standard CXR (posterior-anterior [PA] andlateral views) at 
the Screening Visit to rule out the presence of TB or other clinically relevant findings.  
The CXR will not be required if the subject had a previous normal chest x-ray within 90 days of Screening, provided all protocol required documentation is available at the site (as outlined below).
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
64
Subjects can have a repeat CXR at any time during the study as warranted based on the 
opinion of the Investigator.
In the assessment of the chest x-ray, a radiologist must note the presence or absence of 
1) calcified granulomas, 2) pleural scarring /thickening, and 3) signs of active TB.  The 
Principal Investigator will indicate the clinical significance of any findings and will sign and date the report.  The CXR reports require the signature of both the radiologist who read the films and the Principal Investigator.  If it is the site's policy that the radiologist does not sign the final report, the report must include the date of the procedure, the name of the interpreting radiologist and at a minimum must be signed and dated by the Principal Investigator.
TB Screening
A PPD skin test (alternatively, also known as tuberculin skin test) must be placed or a 
Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA; QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test or T-SPOT TB test) must be performed during the Screening Period for all subjects including those with a prior history of BCG administration.  If a subject had a negative PPD or IGRA test within 90 days prior to Screening, and all protocol required documentation is available, this test does not need to be repeated, provided nothing has 
changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test.  These cases must be discussed with the AbbVie SDP.
For the PPD test:
The subject will be required to have the PPD test read by a licensed healthcare 
professional 48 to 72 hours (or according to manufacturer's guide) after placement when 
the induration is maximal.  An induration (not erythema) of 5 mm or greater will be considered as PPD positive, irrespective of BCG status or local guidelines.  The induration must be recorded in mm not as positive or negative.  The absence of induration should be recorded as "0 mm," not "negative."  (If required by specific countries a 
two-step test may be performed per local guidelines.  The result of the second test should be recorded.  An induration of 5 mm or greater will be considered as PPD positive.)
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
65
Subjects who have had an ulcerating reaction to a PPD skin test in the past should not be 
re-exposed and should not be tested at Screening but will be considered PPD positive.
If there are sites where the accepted testing materials are not available an alternative may 
be substituted, but the method must be submitted and approved by AbbVie prior to use with study subjects.
In the assessment of the chest x-ray, a radiologist must note the presence or absence of 1) 
calcified granulomas, 2) pleural scarring/thickening, and 3) signs of active TB.  The Principal Investigator will indicate the clinical significance of any findings and will sign and date the report.  If the CXR demonstrates changes suggestive of previous TB (e.g., calcified nodule, fibrotic scar, apical or basilar pleural thickening) or other findings 
that are clinically significant, the Principal Investigator must contact the AbbVie SDP before enrolling the subject.
If the PPD or the IGRA test is positive or the subject has a CXR i ndicative of latent TB, 
the subject will be required to initiate and have taken at least 2 weeks (or per local 
guidelines, whichever is longer) of an ongoing course of Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommended prophylaxis or prophylaxis per local guidelines prior to starting study therapy.
Subjects with a prior history of latent TB that have a documented completion of the CDC 
recommended or local guideline recommended prophylaxis may be permitted to enroll.  If the subject has a prior history of latent TB but has not completed or received prophylaxis, prophylaxis must be initiated for at least 2 weeks (or per local guidelines, whichever is longer) before enrolling into the study.
If the subject has a prior history of active TB they must have documentation of 
completion of CDC recommended or local guideline recommended treatment and documentation of resolution of the infection.
Subjects should be screened for TB using either PPD or IGRA.  In the event both a PPD 
test and an IGRA test are performed, if either one is positive, the subject will be 
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
66
considered to be positive and should initiate TB prophylaxis.  If the IGRA test is 
indeterminate, the site should repeat the test.  If the second IGRA test is also indeterminate, the subject is considered to be positive and should initiate TB prophylaxis.  If the IGRA test is indeterminate, the site should repeat the test with another blood sample or perform a PPD test.  If the second IGRA test or PPD is also indeterminate, the subject is considered to be positive and should initiate TB prophylaxis.
Prior, ongoing and newly initiated TB prophylact ic treatment should be captured on the 
concomitant medications page in the eCRF and in the source documents.  Known history of latent/active TB should be captured on the medical history eCRF page.
For sites participating in the Czech Republic, the following local requirements will 
also be applicable:
●A pulmonologist will be responsible to obtain a detailed medical history with 
respect to TB exposure.  This information needs to include BCG vaccination, 
cohabitation with individuals who have had TB, and/or reside or work in TB endemic locations.  The information obtain ed by the pulmonologist must be 
documented in the subject's source note, dated and signed by the pulmonologist.
●A pulmonologist must review the results of the PPD skin test or the IGRA test and the chest x-ray and provide his/he r opinion about the eligibility of each 
subject to be enrolled to the study.  This opinion must be documented in 
writing in the subject's source documents.
●All subjects with a positive PPD or IGRA test need to be approved for entry into the trial by both the Czech pulmonologist and the AbbVie SDP and all such subjects need to receive prophylaxis for latent TB.  Under no 
circumstances can a subject with a positive PPD or IGRA test result and no 
prior history of treatment for active or latent TB be allowed into this trial.
Pregnancy Tests
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at the Screening Visit on all female subjects of 
childbearing potential.  At the Baseline Visit, Week 12, and Week 56/PD, subjects of 
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
67
childbearing potential will have a urine pregnancy test performed locally by designated 
study personnel.  The frequency can be increased up to every visit as per local regulations.  
If any urine pregnancy test is positive, a serum pregnancy test will be performed by the 
central laboratory.  A lactating or pregnant female will not be eligible for participation or continuation in this study.
All women of childbearing potential will have a repeat urine pregnancy test at the final 
Study Visit (PD) performed locally by designated study personnel.
Hepatitis B Testing
All subjects will be tested for the presence of the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) at Screening.  
A positive result for the Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag) will be exclusionary.  Samples that are negative for HBs Ag will be tested for surface antibodies (HBs Ab) and core antibodies (HBc Ab Total).  Subjects with HBs Ag (–), HBs Ab* (–), and HBc Ab Total (+) require PCR qualitative testing f or HBV DNA.  Any HBV DNA PCR result that 
meets or exceeds detection sensitivity will be exclusionary.
Subjects with a negative HBs Ag test and tests showing the results below do not require 
HBV DNA PCR qualitative testing: 
●HBc Ab Total (–) and HBs Ab* (–)
●HBc Ab Total (–) and HBs Ab* (+)
●HBc Ab Total (+) and HBs Ab* (+)
* For HBs Ab test results, a (–) result for HBs Ab is equivalent to 
nonreactive and a (+) result is equivalent to reactive.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Blood samples will be obtained for the laboratory tests listed in Table 4 .  Blood draws 
should be performed after eff icacy assessments and questionnaires (CDAI, IBDQ, etc.), 
vital sign determinations are obtained and before study drug administration during a visit.

Chemistry/hematology a nd urinalysis assessments will only need to be repeated at 
Baseline if the time between Screening and Baseline is greater than 14 days, or if the 
subject's health status has changed to warrant a repeat test.
A certified central laboratory will be utilized to process and provide results for the clinical 
laboratory tests.  All abnormal laboratory tests that are considered clinically significant by the investigator will be followed to a satisfactory resolution.
The central laboratory chosen for this study  will provide instructions regarding the 
collection, processing and shipping of these samples.If required by country regulatory authorities to confirm eligibility, subjects will be tested 
for antibodies to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) at Screening and documented 
that the test has been performed.  This testing is to be done at a local lab.  A subject will not be eligible for study participation if test results indicate a positive HIV infection.  AbbVie will not receive results from the testing and not be made aware of any positive result.

Other Laboratory Assessments
ANA/anti-dsDNA
Blood samples for antinuclear anti body (ANA) will be obtained per Table 3 .  
Anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) assessments will be performed if ANA is 
positive.
In the event that subject develops lupus-like symptoms, ANA sample will be obtained.
hs-CRP
Blood samples for high-sensi tivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) will be obtained per 
Table 3 .  The Screening hs-CRP will serve as the Baseline value.  The hs-CRP results in 
the Induction Study starting from Baseline to Week 8 will remain blinded to Investigator, 
study site personnel and the subject.  The hs-CRP results in the Maintenance Study starting at Week 12 to Week 56 will be unblinded to the Investigator, study site personnel and the subject.
Blood draws should be performed after all e fficacy assessments, questionnaires (CDAI, 
IBDQ, etc.), and vital sign determinatio ns are obtained and before study drug 
administration during a visit.
Stool Samples Collected
Fecal Calprotectin
Fecal calprotectin will be performed for all subjects as indicated in Table 3 .  If subjects 
are unable to provide a sample at the site visit, subjects w ill be sent home with a stool 
sample supply kit and the site will give instructions to assist with co llection proce dures.  
The fecal calprotectin sample collected during the Screening Period will be used as the 
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
71
baseline.  All stool samples should be collected before any bowel preparation for 
endoscopy is started and returned to the site within 3 days of collection.
The fecal calprotectin results will remain blinded to Investigator, study site personnel and 
the subject throughout the study.
The central laboratory will be utilized to process and provide results for these laboratory 
tests.
C. Difficile Stool Testing
During the Screening Period a stool sample will be collected and sent to the central 
laboratory for testing.  The sample will be assessed for the presence of C. difficile toxin.
The sample must be shipped to the central laboratory using dry ice.  Additional information is available in the Investigator Manual provided by the central laboratory.
Subjects who are positive for C. difficile toxin may be treated appropriately and 
re-screened.
Microbiota Metagenomic Analysis
An additional stool microbiota metagenomic an alyses will be performed as indicated in 
Table 3 .  Subjects will be asked to provide a stool sample at the visit, if possible.  Or, 
subjects will be sent home with stool sample supplies and the site will give instructions 
with collection procedures.  At Screenin g, Week 12, and Week 56/PD, the stool sample 
should be collected prior to the bowel preparation for endoscopy has started (if possible) and returned to the site within 3 days of co llection.  A central la boratory(s) will be utilized 
to process these laboratory tests.
Where allowed by local requirements at the time of the stool sample co llection, any 
remaining stool could be used for future exploratory analysis of non-genetic biomarkers 
related to the subject's disease and/or response to study drug or additional therapies, or development of adverse events.  These samples may also be used for the development of 
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
72
diagnostic tests.  Results of exploratory analy ses, if any, will not be reported with the 
study summary.  AbbVie will store the samples  in a secure storage space with adequate 
measures to protect confidentiality.  The samples will be retained for no longer than 
20 years after completion of the study (where allowed by local requirements) for possible future research.
Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI)
A CDAI score will be calculated from a subject diary, physical exam, and appropriate 
laboratory values at all study visits beginning at Screening.  The Screening period will be 
a minimum of 7 days to calculate the CDAI score.  The CDAI calculated at Screening will serve as the Baseline CDAI.
Beginning with the Week 2 through Week 56 visits and including unscheduled visits, the 
CDAI scores must be calculated using a hematocrit value from the preceding visit laboratory work.
CDAI at Visit HCT Value Utilized
Week 2 Baseline
Week 4 Week 2
Week 6 Week 4
Week 8 Week 4
Week 12 Week 8
Week 26 Week 12
Week 40 Week 26
Week 56 Week 40
For calculating CDAI at Screening through Week 56/Premature Discontinuation, to answer questions one (1) through three (3), entries from the 7 days prior to the visit should be used as recorded by the subject from the diary.
Diary entries should not be included in the 7 days evaluated prior to the visit if:  (1) the 
day the subject received medication for bowel preparation prior to endoscopy, (2) the day 
the subject underwent an endoscopy, and (3) 2 days following the endoscopy.  Earlier 
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
73
diary entries will be used accordingly in order to provide the most recent data for 7 days 
prior to the respective study visit.
For the CDAI questions regarding presence of anal fistulas and other fistulas, all fistulas 
detectable on physical examination (draining and non-draining) should be captured on the CDAI and calculated into the CDAI score.
When completing question five (5) ("Tak ing Lomotil/Imodium/Loperamide/opiates for 
diarrhea, 0 = no, 1 = yes") on the CDAI, "no" should be answered if a subject is taking an 
opiate(s) solely for pain.
For question seven (7), hematocrit results from central laboratory will be used for the 
CDAI calculation.  If the hematocrit value contains more than one decimal point, the 
rounding will be allowed to the tenths decimal (e.g., Hct value 33.44 will be captured as 33.4, Hct value of 33.45 will be captured as 33.5).  The Hct values either prior to completing the calculation or at the subtotal box 7 of the CDAI should not be rounded to a whole number.
The height obtained at Screening should be used when selecting the standard weight in 
Appendix H , and this standard weight should be used for calculating every CDAI 
throughout subject participation in the study.
Standard height is calculated by using the height obtained at Screening (without shoes) 
plus one inch. 
If the body weight obtained at the time of assessment is not captured in kilograms (kg), 
then when converting into kg, rounding should occur using the second digit after the decimal (also known as the hundredth place) where if the number is 0 – 4, then keep the first digit after the decimal (also known as the tenth place) unchanged.  If the second digit after the decimal is 5 – 9, then round up the first digit after the decimal (e.g., 90.246 would be captured as 90.2 and 97.687 would be captured as 97.7).
The subtotal of box 8 should not be rounded to a whole number.

Outcomes and Questionnaires
●IBDQ – Inflammatory Bowel disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) will be completed 
at the time points indicated in Table 3 (Appendix E ).
●WPAI – Work Productivity and impairment Questionnaire will be completed at the time points indicated in Table 3 .  The data in the subject-completed 
questionnaire will be transferred to the appropriate eCRF (Electronic Case Report Form) by the site personnel at each study visit ( Appendix C ).
●EQ-5D – A standardized questionnaire for use as a measure of health outcome (Appendix D ).
●Abdominal Pain Rating Scale ( Appendix F ).
●Bristol Stool Form Scale ( Appendix L ).
●SES-CD Scoring – Simplified endoscopic score for Crohn's disease – Investigator should complete all components of the SES-CD scoring 
sheet at the time points indicated in Table 3 (Appendix M ).
Corticosteroid Taper
At Week 4, subjects who are on prednisone (or equivalent) or budesonide will taper their 
dose according to the following regimen or a regimen at the investigator's discretion.  If the Investigator feels that the steroid taper is not advisable for a particular subject at Week 4, the SDP should be consulted for evaluation and approval.
Dose Rate
Prednisone (or equivalent) > 10 mg/day 5 mg/day/week
≤ 10 mg/day 2.5 mg/day/week
Budesonide ≤ 9 mg/day 3 mg/day/week
If the subject should experience a loss of satisfactory clinical response in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject may have his/her corticosteroid dose increased per the investigator's discretion up to and beyond the dose used at Baseline.  Subjects may not be on both oral budesonide and oral prednisone (or equivalent) simultaneously.

Subject Diary
Subjects will be dispensed an electronic diary at Screening and will be trained on how to 
complete the diary by site staff during the Screening visit.  All subjects should complete their subject diary on a daily basis throughout the entire study.  The diary will be reviewed 
by site personnel with the subject at each visit and collected at the Final/PD visit.
The dosing records will be reviewed and verified for compliance at each visit by the 
research personnel at the study center and reinforced if necessary.  All relevant dosing information will be retained by the study coordinator and transcribed into the eCRF.  Additionally, any discernible departure from the protocol regarding study drug administration will be recorded on the source documents and in the appropriate drug accountability form.
Study Drug Dispensing/Administration
Study drug will be administered to all subjects onsite by either site medical staff or the 
subjects or designee (friend, family member or health care professional) during the first visit.  The subject or a designated family member or friend will be trained to administer the SC injections of adalimumab.  Detailed instructions and training for the administration of adalimumab are provided in Appendix G .
Adalimumab injections occurring during study visits  will be performed at the visit by the 
subject or their designated family member, friend or Healthcare Professional under the supervision of trained medical personnel to reinforce proper aseptic SC injection technique.  Subjects or a trained designated family member, friend or Healthcare Professional will perform the injections of adalimumab in the subject's home during the weeks they are not in for scheduled clinic visits.
Study drug kits are assigned by the IVRS /IWRS following the subjects randomized 
treatment schedule.
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
76
The Induction Study begins with the first four doses of study drug being administered on 
site the same day at the Baseline Visit.  At the Baseline and Week 2 visits, the IVR will 
have to be called twice.  The first call to the IVR will determine the first two kits to be administered to the subject during the visit.  Site staff will need to contact the IVR system a second time to obtain the additional two kits which will be provided to the subject to take home.  For Induction and Maintenance Studies, the site staff will remind the subject to take the syringes in the correct order per kit before opening a new kit, when applicable.  The IVR will be contacted once at all remaining on-site visits to receive the correct study drug kit(s).  The first syringe will be admin istered at the site and the remaining kits 
containing syringes will be sent home with the subject.  Subjects must be reminded to take the syringes in the assigned kits in the order dispensed by the IVR system.
Subjects should administer study drug on the same day of the week.  The dosing dates for 
all doses of study drug should be calculated from the Baseline Visit date.  A ± 3-day window is allowable for scheduled study dosing dates.  For subjects that deviate from this dosing window, every effort should be made to bring the subject back to the original dosing schedule as soon as possible.  For situations where bringing the subject back on the original dosing schedule will cause the dose to be out of the ± 3-day window, please contact the AbbVie SDP for additional instructions.
At all office visits, subjects should be observed after study drug administration until 
judged clinically stable by the study personnel.  If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administrati on of study drug should be discontinued 
immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.  Wh en dosing at home subjects should be 
instructed to contact the site immediately with any signs or symptoms of a reaction.  If subjects are unable to reach their study site or experience life-threatening symptoms, they will be instructed to call an emergency number or proceed to the nearest emergency room and then inform the site as soon as possible.
Subjects will be instructed to return all used and unused syringes, sharp containers and 
empty boxes at each visit for accountability.

Bristol Stool Assessment
Subjects will rate their stool consistency on a daily basis.  The subject should report the 
type which is most representative for that day according to the Bristol Stool Chart (Appendix L ).  The Bristol Stool Chart defines 7 types of stool which may be seen in 
normal and abnormal bowel movements.
Endoscopy
An endoscopy will be performed on the following visits:
●During Screening*
●Week 12
●Week 56/Premature Discontinuation if PD occurs after Week 26
It is expected all subjects will have a Week 12 and 56/PD Endoscopy.  Site staff should schedule the Week 12 Endoscopy during the Baseline visit, if possible.  For subjects that PD, the site should attempt to reschedule the Endoscopy prior to the discontinuation visit.
*An endoscopy performed before the Screening visit, may be used as the Screening endoscopy, with the approval of the AbbVie Study Designated Physician, if the following 
conditions are met:
1. biopsy confirmation of the diagnosis is available according to section "Biopsy 
During Endoscopy" below.
2. the endoscopy took place within  45 days before Baseline Visit.
3. the endoscopy was performed and recorded in a video format as the endoscopic 
eligibility will be determined by the central reviewers.  The same endoscopist, where possible, should perform all endoscopies.
All ileocolonoscopies should be performed and recorded in a video format during the 
Screening Period or endoscopy performed within 45 days before Baseline and the

Week 56/PD visit.  Sites should also perform an SES-CD assessment and record findings 
on the provided SES-CD score sheet, refer to Appendix M .  The findings should be 
entered in the appropriate eCRF.  Videos from Screening endoscopies from subjects the Investigator believes are eligible for the trial (i.e., subjects with an SES-CD ≥ 6, excluding 
the presence of narrowing component, (or SES-CD ≥ 4, excluding the presence of 
narrowing component, for patients with disease limited to the ileum), and all Week 12 and Week 56/PD endoscopies conducted will undergo central review.  Two primary central reviewers will evaluate the data and provide their score.  If the SES-CD scores are discrepant between the two readers, a third central reviewer will review the video and choose between the first and second reviewers' scores.  The third reviewer's cho ice 
between the reviewers' scores will be considered final.  This process will apply to all video endoscopies where the first and second reviewers do not agree.  The adjudicator's assessment will be considered final.  If, in the opinion of the Investigator, the Screening endoscopy does not indicate the SES-CD criter ia confirming study eligibility, the subject 
should be screen-failed and the video should not be sent for central review.  Endoscopic eligibility will be determined by the central reviewers.  The same endoscopist, where possible, should perform all endoscopies.
The endoscopy during the Screening Period or endoscopy performed within 45 days 
before Baseline and Week 56/PD will be used to provide the endoscopy subscores for calculating the Simplified Endoscopic Score (SES-CD) at Screening, Week 12, and Week 56/PD, refer to Appendix M .  The SES-CD values provided by the central reader 
will be used for all endpoint analyses.
Biopsy During Endoscopy
Appropriate documentation of biopsy results consistent with the diagnosis of CD, in the 
assessment of the Investigator, must be available in order to confirm the subject's eligibility for the study.  If this documen tation is not  available, a diagnostic biopsy from 
the most affected area of the ileum/colon must be performed during Screening and read by a qualified local pathologist and the results reviewed by the Investigator.  Biopsies to evaluate suspicious lesions or to rule out malignancy may be taken per the Investigator's 
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
79
discretion and evaluated by the local pathologist.  If the biopsy sample(s) are obtained 
during the endoscopy used to determine sub ject eligibility, it shoul d also be recorded.  
The biopsy should not interfere with the recording the central reviewers will use for their evaluation.
The signed pathology reports confirming diagnosis and when appropriate, ruling out 
current dysplasia/malignancy will be monitored by the responsible Clinical Research Associate (CRA) and kept with the subject's source documents onsite.  Subjects should not be enrolled if colon dysplasia or malignancy is discovered at Screening endoscopy or endoscopy performed within 45 days before Baseline.  If a diagnosis of colon dysplasia or malignancy is discovered during any subsequent endoscopic evaluation during the course of the study, the findings should be recorded as an adverse event and the subject should be discontinued from the study.
5.3.1.2 Blood Sample for Pharmacogenetic Analysis
One 4 mL whole blood sample for DNA isolation will be collected per Table 3 from each 
subject who consents for pharmacogenetic analyses.  If the sample is not drawn at the 
Baseline visit, preferably it s hould be drawn at the next study visit.  The procedure for 
obtaining and documenting informed consent is discussed in Section 9.3.  Please refer to
the laboratory manual for instructions.
Samples will be shipped frozen to the central laboratory and then to AbbVie for long-term 
storage.  Samples should not be allowed to thaw prior to arrival at AbbVie or the designated laboratory.  Arrangements will be made with the central laboratory for the shipment of PG samples to AbbVie or specified lab for testing.
Samples will be stored in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect 
confidentiality.  The samples will be retained for no longer than 20 years after completion of the study (where allowed by local guidelines) for possible future research.

Table 3 .  Please refer to the laboratory manual for specific instructions.
The frozen samples for mRNA analysis will be packed in dry ice sufficient to last during transport and shipped from the study site to the central laboratory.  Samples should not be 
allowed to thaw prior to arrival at AbbVie or the designated laboratory.  An inventory of the samples included will accompany the package.  Arrangements will be made with the central laboratory for the shipment of samples to AbbVie or specified lab for testing.
5.3.1.4 Collection and Handling of Optional Intestinal Biopsy 
Samples for Exploratory Research
Subjects will have the option to provide intestinal biopsy samples for exploratory 
research, where allowed by local requirements.  Subjects may participate in the main study even if they decide not to participate in this optional exploratory research.
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
81
Exploratory research can improve our understanding of how individuals respond to drugs 
and our ability to predict which patients would benefit from receiving specific therapies.  In addition, exploratory research may help to improve our understanding of how to diagnose and assess/monitor IBD by asse ssing associations between disease 
characteristics, outcomes data and biomarkers of interests.
AbbVie (or people or companies working with AbbVie) will store the biomarker 
exploratory research samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  The samples will be retained while research on adalimumab (or drugs of this class) or Inflammatory Bowel Disease and related conditions continues, but for no longer than 20 years after study completion (where allowed by local requirements).
Collection of Optional Intestinal Biopsy Samples for Exploratory Research
During the Screening endoscopy, intestinal biopsy samples are desired from the 
recto-sigmoid, transverse and left colon.  If there is inflammation in any of these 3 colonic segments, use standard biopsy forceps to collect one biopsy from the most inflamed area or the edge of an ulcer if ulcers are present, and one biopsy from a normal area in that segment at least 15 mm away from any inflamed area.  If possible collect biopsies from several places in each inflamed segment up to a total of 24 biopsies per subject.
At Week 12 and Week 56 or Premature Discontinuation biopsies from the most inflamed 
areas are again requested.  A biopsy of the edge of an ulcer, if ulceration is present and one biopsy from a normal mucosa in each segment at least 15 mm from any inflamed area and one biopsy in a healed area, if an area showed active disease at baseline can be easily identified.
Samples will be shipped to AbbVie or a designated laboratory for long-term storage.  
Instructions for the preparation and shipment of the biomarker exploratory research samples will be provided in a laboratory manual.

will be performed with the focus on apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of 
distribution (V/F) of adalimumab.
5.3.6 Pharmacogenetic and Serologic Variables
5.3.6.1 Pharmacogenetic Variables
Samples may be sequenced and data analy zed for DNA sequences contributing to the 
disease or to subject's response to adalimumab, in terms of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, 
tolerability and safety.  Such DNA sequences may include those related to drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transport proteins, the ta rget pathway, or others related to the 
disease or to drug response.  Some DNA sequences that are currently insufficiently characterized or unknown may be understood to be important at the time of analysis.  The samples may also be used for the development of diagnostic tests.  The results of pharmacogenetic analyses may not be reported with the study summary.
5.3.6.2 Serologic Variables
Samples may be analyzed for plasma and serum proteins, peptides, and non-protein 
soluble factors such as lipids that may help predict disease behavior and help determine 
more severe disease phenotypes. 
Where allowed by local requirements at the time of the blood draw for biomarkers, serum 
may be stored for possible future research.  Samples will be stored frozen for future exploratory analysis of non-genetic biomarkers related to the subject's disease and/or response to study drug or additional therapies, or development of adverse events.  These samples may also be used for the development of diagnostic tests.  Results of exploratory analyses, if any, will not be reported with  the study summary.  AbbVie will store the 
samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  As allowed by local requirements, the samples will be retained for up to 20 years after completion of the study research.
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
93
5.3.7 Exploratory Research Variables
Optional intestinal biopsy samples may be collected to conduct exploratory investigations 
into known and novel biomarkers.  The types of biomarkers to be analyzed may include, but are not limited to:  nucleic acids, proteins, lipids or metabolites. 
Biomarker assessments may be used to assess and generate prognostic, predictive, 
pharmacodynamic, or surrogate biomarker signatures.  These assessments may be explored in the context of Inflammatory Bowe l Disease or related conditions and/or 
adalimumab or drugs of similar class.  The results from these analyses are exploratory in nature and may not be included with the study report.
The samples may also be used to develop new therapies, research methods or 
technologies.  In addition, samples from this study may be banked for future use.  Samples may then be used to validate putative biomarker signatures obtained from a prospective study, leading to the development of diagnostic tests.
5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
A subject may withdraw from the study at any time.  The Investigator may discontinue 
any subject's participation for any reason, including an adverse event, safety concerns or 
failure to comply with the protocol.
Subjects will be withdrawn from the study immediately if any one of the following 
occurs:
●Clinically significant abnormal laboratory result(s) or adverse event(s), as 
determined by the Investigator in consultation with the AbbVie SDP.
●The Investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject.
●The subject requests withdrawal from the study.

study drug use, the procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation Visit must be completed within 2 weeks of the last dose of study drug, and preferably prior to the initiation of another therapy.  However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the Investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject's condition.  Following discontinuation of the study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the Investigator's best clinical judgment.
A final phone call will be made to the subject approximately 70 days after the last dose of 
study drug to determine the status of any ongoing AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs.  The 70-day follow-up phone call will not be required for any subject that initiates commercial adalimumab.
All attempts must be made to determine the date of the last dose of study drug and the 
primary reason for premature discontinuation.  The information will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page.

For subjects that are considered lost to follow-up, reasonable attempts must be made to 
obtain information on the final status of the subject.  At a minimum, two phone calls must be made and one certified letter must be sent.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, ei ther in its entirety or at any study site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination.  The investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination.  Advance notice is not required by either part y if the study is stopped due to safety 
concerns.  If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will immediately notify the investigator by telephone and subsequently provide written instructions forstudy termination.
5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Treatments Administered
During the randomized double-blind Induction Study, subjects assigned to the higher 
induction regimen will receive blinded adalimumab 160 mg (4 syringes) at Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, and Week 3.  At Week 4, subjects will receive 40 mg (1 syringe) eow through Week 12.
Subjects assigned to the standard induction regimen will receive blinded adalimumab 
160 mg (4 syringes) at Baseline and matching placebo (4 syringes) at Week 1.  Subjects will receive 80 mg (2 syringes) and placebo (2 syringes) at Week 2 and matching placebo (4 syringes) at Week 3.  At Week 4, subjects will receive 40 mg (1 syringe) eow through Week 12.
At Week 12, subjects will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two double-
blinded exploratory treatment regimens (a dalimumab clinically adjusted [CA] regimen 
and adalimumab therapeutic drug monitoring [TDM] regimen).  The re-randomization at Week 12 will be stratified by induction treatment regimen, clinical response (CR-70) 
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
96
status at Week 12 and decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline per the site investigator 
reading at Week 12.  Among subjects achieving SES-CD > 50% from Baseline atWeek 12, the randomization will be further stratified by achievement of an SES-CD ≤ 4 
and at least a 2 point reduction versus baseline and no subscore greater than 1 in any individual variable using the Week 12 SES-CD value provided by the site.
Clinically Adjusted (CA) Regimen:Subjects randomized to the clinically adjusted regimen will receive 40 mg adalimumab 
every other week beginning at Week 12.  The adalimumab dose will be escalated to every week starting as early as Week 14 if the subject's CDAI is ≥ 220 or hs-CRP ≥ 10 mg/L 
(using results from the prior or current visi t).  These subjects will also be allowed to 
escalate at unscheduled visits that may occur only on Weeks 16, 18, 22, 24, 30, 32, 36, 38, 44, 46, 50, 52 and 54.  Once subjects in the CA regimen are escalated, they will remain on 40 mg ew dosing.
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) Regimen:At Weeks 14, 28 and 42, the adalimumab dose for subjects randomized to the TDM will 
be determined by the dose adjustment criteria table ( Table 2 ).  Doses will be determined 
using blinded serum concentrations at the prior visit (Weeks 12, 26 and 40, respectively) as well as the CDAI or hs-CRP values from the current or prior visit.  For subjects who meet criteria for dose escalation at Weeks 14, 28 or 42, subjects will receive 40 mg weekly.
The duration of the study could be up to 60 weeks which includes a Screening Period of 
1 to 4 weeks, ± 3 days which is granted around all study visits, a 12-week double-blind 
period Induction Study, and a 44-week Maintena nce Study.  The Screening period may be 
extended as necessary after consul tation and a pproval with the AbbVie Study Designated 
Physician (SDP) for subjects who require initiation of prophylactic anti-tuberculosis (TB) therapy, or in case of external, not subject-related circumstances (e.g., due to delay of 
Adalimumab

97
availability of screening test results).  There will also be a 70-day follow-up phone call for 
subjects who complete Week 56 or discontinue from the study prematurely.
No dose will be given at the final visit.

All labels must remain affixed to study drug at all times, and should never be removed for 
any reason.
Detailed instructions and training for the administration of study drug supplies are 
provided in Appendix G .
5.5.2.2 Storage and Disposition of Study Drugs
Adalimumab/placebo pre-filled syringes are to be stored protected from light at 2° to 
8°C/36° to 46°F.  Study drug must not be frozen at any time .  A storage temperature log 
is to be maintained to document proper storage conditions.  The refrigerator temperature must be recorded on a temperature log to record proper function.
Malfunctions or any temperature excursion lasting longer than 30 minutes must be 
reported to the Sponsor immediately.  Study drug should be quarantined and not dispensed until AbbVie GPRD or AbbVie Temperature Excursion Management System (ATEMS), or alternate system, deems the medication as acceptable.
All clinical supplies must be stored and locked in a secure place until they are dispensed 
for subject use or are returned to AbbVie.Investigational products are for investigational use only and are to be used only within the 
context of this study.
5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number by the IRT at the screening 
study visit.  Subjects who meet the entry criteria in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 will 
proceed to be enrolled into the study.  Subjects who enter the study will be rando mized at 
Baseline in a 3:2 ratio to receive a higher induction regimen or standard induction regimen.
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
99
At Week 12, subjects will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two double-
blinded exploratory treatment regimens (adalimumab clinically ad justed [CA] regimen 
and adalimumab therapeutic drug monitoring [TDM] regimen).
The sites will be provided with appropriate kit number(s) for drug-dispensing purpose for 
each subject by the IRT.  Before the study is initiated, the directions for the IVRS will be provided to each site.  Study drug will be administered at the study visits summarized in Table 3 .
5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Subjects should take study drug as outlined in Section 5.5.1 .
If a subject should forget to administer the injection of study drug on their regularly 
scheduled dosing date, they should take the forgotten injection as soon as they remember 
the dose was missed up to the day of their next scheduled dose.  The subject should not 
administer two doses on the same day.
In the event the incorrect dose is taken or a dose is missed, the subject should be 
instructed to contact the site to determine how to proceed with dosing.  The subject should record all dosing information in the Subject Diary.
Doses not administered (e.g., not taken before ne xt dose is scheduled), should be recorded 
as not taken in the source.  The extra dose should be returned to the study site full.  The 
subject should resume their regular dosing schedule based on the first dosing date at Baseline.
5.5.5 Blinding
5.5.5.1 Blinding of Investigational Product
All AbbVie personally with direct oversi ght of the conduct and management of the trial 
(with the exception of AbbVie's Drug Suppl y Management Team) the Investigator, study 
site personnel and the subject will remain blinded to each subject's treatment throughout 
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
100
the blinded period of the study.  The IVRS/IWRS will provide access to blinded subject 
treatment information in the case of medical emergency.
In the event of a medical emergency in which the Investigator believes that knowledge of 
study drug treatment is required, every effort  must be made to contact the AbbVie SDP 
(see Section 7.0) prior to breaking the blind, as long as it does not compromise subject 
safety.  The date and reason that the blind was broken must be conveyed to AbbVie and recorded on the appropriate eCRF.
5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The Investigator or his/her designated representatives will dispense study drug only for 
use by subjects enrolled in the study. 
The subject or their qualified designee will administer all dos es of study drug.  
Appropriate site staff will supervise the subject's administration of the study drug at 
required in-office study visits to ensure proper injection technique.  In order to document 
compliance with the treatment regimen, the s ubject will be given a diary to record all 
injection dates and times.  Compliance information will be documented on the appropriate eCRF.  Subjects will be counseled on missed doses of medication.  If the subject does not return the diary, IP boxes and sharp containers (when applicable), the site should question the subject and obtain as much information as possible as to the dosing of the study drug.
The information should be documented on the source documents as per "best recollection" 
and when possible, re-verified when the diary is returned before completing on the applicable eCRF page.
5.5.7 Drug Accountability
The Investigator or designee will verify that study drug supplies are received intact, at the 
appropriate temperature, and in the correct amounts.  This will be accomplished by documenting the condition of the shipment, verifying the kit numbers in the package against the Proof of Receipt (POR) or similar document included with each drug 
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
101
shipment, and documenting this verification by signing and dating the POR or similar 
document.  The original POR Note or similar document will be kept in the site files as a record of what was received.
In addition, an accurate running inventory of study drug will be kept by the site on a Site 
Drug Accountability log including date received, the lot number, kit number(s), date 
dispensed, subject number, and the identification with date of the person dispensing the 
drug.  For this study, unless otherwise prohibited locally, these records will be maintained electronically as part of the IVRS/IWRS system.
All empty IP boxes and used pre-filled syringes will be inventoried by the site and each 
subject will be given their own Sharps disposal container to store used pre-filled syringes.  Empty IP boxes and Sharps containers should be returned by the subject at each visit for accountability and compliance purposes and new containers issued as necessary.  Empty boxes and returned Sharps containers will be retained (unless prohibited by local law or site policy/procedure) until the CRA is on site to confirm the returned medication.  CRAs and site staff will complete study drug accoun tability via study drug logs, source 
documents, subject dosing diary sheets, empty IP boxes and by visually inspecting the 
syringes in the Sharps container whenever possible.  Used Sharps containers should never be opened.  Once the CRA has verified drug accountability at the site, the site staff and CRA will document that the used pre-filled syringes have been destroyed, using appropriate biohazard precautions, when appropriate.  A copy of the destruction methodology should be  maintained at the site's facility.  Unused medication will be 
returned by the CRA after drug accountability has been completed at the site.
5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
The design of this clinical trial was chosen to demonstrate the efficacy of a higher 
induction regimen of adalimumab compared to the standard induction regimen.  The efficacy time points of Week 4 and Week 12 are comparable to prior studies with adalimumab, specifically Study M02-403, Study M04-691, and Study M05-769.  The 
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
102
study is double-blinded and subjects are randomized to receive a higher induction regimen 
of adalimumab or a standard induction regimen of adalimumab.  After the induction regimens are provided, subjects in both treatment groups will receive blinded adalimumab 40 mg eow until Week 12.  Subjects will begin tapering of corticosteroids at Week 4.
No placebo arm is planned since there is well-documented efficacy of adalimumab in CD 
and because the purpose of this study is to achieve better efficacy than the standard induction regimen in terms of clinical remission and endoscopic improvement.  Additionally, since subjects will be required to have failed or been intolerant of standard therapies and have evidence of endoscopic damage confirmed by a central reader, it would be not medically acceptable to deny thos e patients effective treatment or feasible to 
enroll patients in the trial when adalimumab is available to be prescribed for CD.
5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard statistical, clinical, endoscopy-related and laboratory procedures will be utilized 
in this study.  All efficacy measurements in this study are standard for assessing disease 
activity in sub jects with Crohn's disease.  All clinical and laboratory procedures in this 
study are standard and generally accepted.
5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population
Subjects with active CD who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria 
are eligible for this study.  The specific subject population chosen was based on the unmet medical need for subjects with evidence of mucosal ulceration.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The use of an induction dose higher than the approved dose of 160/80 mg (Week 0/2) is 
supported by exposure-efficacy modeling analyses from the pivotal registration Study M02-403 (anti-TNF naïve subjects) and Study M04-691 (anti-TNF experienced subjects).
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
103
The goal of the TDM regimen is to attain and maintain serum adalimumab levels above 
reasonably high concentration levels in s ubjects for mucosal healing.  Since exposure and 
endoscopic relationships are not currently available for adalimumab, clinical remission was used for the selection of concentration thresholds to be used in the TDM regimen.  Based on the PK analyses of adalimumab concentrations in the adult Crohn's disease studies, Studies M02-403, M04-691 and M02-433, no concentration level could be identified as a significant and reliable predictor of remission.  Therefore, the TDM regimen will be based on two concentration thresholds in conjunction with clinical response criteria as expected to occur in the clinical setting.  About 75% of the subjects, who were in remission at Week 56 in St udy M02-433, had serum concentration levels 
above 5 μ g/mL.  The lower concentration threshold for the TDM regimen was selected as 
5 μg/mL; thus, any subject below 5 μg/mL concentration will be escalated to ew dosing 
regardless of their CDAI or hs-CRP level.  The second threshold was selected as 10μg/mL, which is similar to the median concentrations (9.4 μg/mL at Week 56) 
observed in subjects who were in remission.  The subjects with concentration above 5 and below 10 μg/mL may be dose escalated based on clin ical response as outlined in the table 
below.  The subjects with serum concentration above 10 μg/mL will not be dose 
escalated.

Complaints associated with any component of this investigational product must be 
reported to the Sponsor (Section 6.2.2 ).  For adverse events, please refer to Sections 6.1
through 6.1.7 .  For product complaints, please refer to Section 6.2.
6.1 Medical Complaints
The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse 
events on a routine basis throughout the study.  The investigator will assess and record any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the adverse event to study drug, and any action(s) taken.  For serious adverse events considered as having "no reasonable possibility" of being associated with study drug, the investigator will provide an Other cause of the event.  For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject will be recorded.
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the us e of a medicinal (investigational) product, 
whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illne ss is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse 
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
105
event.  Laboratory abnormalities  and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse 
events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic 
medical intervention (see Section 6.2regarding toxicity management) and/or if the 
investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing c ondition and 
the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned pri or to study entry.  However, if the 
pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpected ly during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
6.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a 
SAE within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have 
been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any 
length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay.  This 
does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  
Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).

Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based 
on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the 
outcomes listed above (i.e., d eath of subject, life-threatening, 
hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital 
anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or 
stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse 
event:
Mild The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by the subject.
Moderate The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the 
subject's usual activities.
Severe The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities and may be incapacitating or life-threatening.
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
107
6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
No Reasonable PossibilityAn adverse event where there is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not repor ted a causality or deemed it not assessable, 
AbbVie will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opinion of no reasonable po ssibility of being related to study drug is 
given, another cause of event must be provided by the investigator for the serious adverse 
event.
6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All adverse events reported from the time of study drug administration until 70 days 
following discontinuation of study drug administration have elapsed will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject.  In addition, serious adverse events will be collected from the time the subject signed the study-specific informed consent.  Adverse event information will be collected and recorded on the appropriate eCRFs.
Subjects will be contacted approximately 70 da ys following study drug discontinuation 
for an assessment of any new or ongoing AEs, except those subjects that continue on 
adalimumab therapy after the end of study participation.  These subjects are not required to complete the 70-day follow-up and any new Adverse Events should be reported 
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
108
through the mechanism used for all post-marketing adverse experiences.  The 70-day 
follow-up phone call will be recorded in sour ce document only and confirmation of the 
contact will be faxed to AbbVie ( Appendix J ).
All Adverse Events identified to AbbVie from the 70-day follow-up phone call will be collected as source data to be evaluated and reported ( Figure 3 ).  Thus, all SAEs and 
nonserious AEs as defined by AbbVie, reported during the 70-day follow-up phone call must be captured in the clinical database.  The end of trial is the last subject contact, i.e., the 70-day follow-up call.
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 3 .

6.1.6 Pregnancy
Pregnancy in a study subject must be reported  to AbbVie within 1 working day of the site 
becoming aware of the pregnancy.  Subjects who become pregnant during the study must 
be discontinued (Section 5.4.1 ).  Pregnancies will be collected from the date of the 
first dose through 150 days following the last dose of study drug. 
Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in a study subject and the outcome of the 
pregnancy will be collected.
Pregnancy in a study subject is not considered an adverse event.  However, the medical 
outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is considered a serious adverse event and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event.
6.1.7 Toxicity Management
Subjects who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with adalimumab 
should be monitored closely.  Administration of study injections should be interrupted if a 
subject develops an infection requiring IV an ti-infective treatment or if  an infection meets 
the definition of "serious" (see Section 6.0for definitions).  Study drug may be restarted 
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
111
once the physician determines that the infection has been successfully treated.  Otherwise 
prohibited concomitant medications may be given if medically necessary.  Prior to use, every attempt should be made to contact the AbbVie Study Physician for direction on re-introduction of adalimumab therapy after prohibited medication administration.
If the subject must undergo elective surgery, the study injections must be interrupted 
2 weeks prior to the surgery.  If the subject must undergo emergency surgery, the study injections must be interrupted at the time of the surgery.  The injectable study drug can recommence at least 2 weeks after surgery once the physician has examined the surgical site and determined that it has healed and there is no sign of infection.
6.2 Product Complaint
6.2.1 Definition
A Product Complaint is any Complaint (see Section 6.0 for the definition) related to the 
biologic or drug component of the product or to the medical device component(s).

to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the study site's knowledge of the event via the Product 
Complaint form.  Product Complain ts occurring during the study will be followed-up to a 
satisfactory conclusion.  All follow-up informat ion is to be reported to the Sponsor (or an 
authorized representative) and documented in source as required by the Sponsor.  Product Complaints associated with adverse events will be reported in the study summary.  All other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing basis.
Product Complaints may require return of the product with the alleged complaint 
condition (syringe, pen, etc.).  In instances where a return is requested, every effort should be made by the investigator to return the product within 30 days.  If returns cannot be accommodated within 30 days, the site will need  to provide justification and an estimated 
date of return.
The description of the complaint is important for AbbVie in order to enable AbbVie to 
investigate and determine if any corrective actions are required.
7.0 Protocol Deviations
AbbVie does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol unless when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects.  The principal investigator is responsible for complying with all protocol requirements, and applicable global and local laws regarding protocol deviations.  If a protocol deviation occurs (or is identified) after a subject has been enrolled, the principal investigator is responsible for notifying Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Independent Review Board (IRB) regulatory authorities (as applicable), and their assigned CRO Clinical Monitor or the following AbbVie Clinical Monitor(s):

efficacy analysis for the Induction Study.  If there is > 10% difference in number of 
subjects with actual treatm ent received and the treatment randomized, a sensitivity 
analysis for the co-primary endpoints based on the actual treatment received will be performed.
Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) set includes all ITT subjects who achieve clinical 
response (CR-70) at Week 12.  The mITT set is the primary population for the effi cacy 
analysis for the Maintenance Study.
The safety set consists of all subjects w ho received at least one injection of study drug.  
The safety set will be analyzed as treated, according to treatment the subject actually 
received.  The safety set will be  used only for safety analysis.
8.1.2 Planned Methods of Statistical Analysis
All statistical tests will be two-tailed with the significance level 0.05.  Descriptive 
statistics will be provided.  These include the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum for continuous variables; and counts and percentages for discrete variables.  The analysis will be performed using SAS
®(SAS 
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
8.1.3 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Demographics and Baseline characteristics of the study subjects will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics.  The p-value will be provided to assess the comparability of the treatment groups assigned by randomization.  The continuous variables will be analyzed 
using the analysis of variance (ANOVA), and discrete variables will be analyzed using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test.

8.1.4 Statistical Analyses of Efficacy
8.1.4.1 Primary Efficacy Variable for Induction Study
The co-primary efficacy variables for Induction Study are proportion of subjects with 
moderately to severely active CD that have achieved clinical remission, defined as CDAI 
< 150, at Week 4 and proportion of subjects that have achieved endoscopic response, defined as a decrease > 50% SES-CD from Baseline (or for a Baseline SES-CD of 4, at least a 2 point reduction from Baseline) at Week 12.
The comparisons between treatment group difference on the two co-primary efficacy 
variables for Induction Study will be performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test and will be stratified by hs-CRP at Baseline (< 10 and ≥ 10 mg/L), prior 
infliximab use, and Crohn's disease severity (CDAI ≤ 300, > 300) at Baseline.  A CMH 
based two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between treatment groups will be calculated.  The ITT set includes all subjects who were randomized at Baseline.  Missing CDAI at Week 4 or SES-CD at Week 12 will be imputed using the non-responder imputation (NRI) approach.
For Week 4 clinical remission, LOCF, OC and multiple imputation methods will be used 
as sensitivity analyses.  For Week 12 endoscopic response, OC will be used as sensitivity analysis.
In addition, as sensitivity analyses, th e logistic regression including treatment, the 
randomizatio n stratification factors and additional clinically important factors such as 
corticosteroid use at Baseline, IMM use at Baseline, Baseline fecal calprotectin, Baseline 
SES-CD, and Region (US versus ex-US), will also be performed for the co-primary endpoints.
8.1.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Variables for Induction Study
Secondary efficacy variables are divided into two groups.  The first group includes ranked 
secondary endpoints, which are ranked by clin ical importance.  Statistical significance is 
assessed at 0.050 (2-sided) in ranked endpoint order until the significant level exceeds 
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
116
0.05.  No additional statist ically signif icant treatment differences could be declared after 
the first ranked endpoint f ails to achieve 0.05.  The second group includes all other 
additional secondary variables.
For categorical ranked and non-ranked secondary endpoints, the difference in proportions 
of subjects between treatment groups will be analyzed using the CMH test adjusted forstratification variables.  Additionally, the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions will be provided.  The non-responder imputation will be used for subjects with missing data at the endpoint evalu ated.  The last observation carried forward 
(LOCF) method will also be used as the sensitivity analyses for the primary and ranked secondary endpoints.
Change from Baseline in continuous ranked and non-ranked secondary endpoints will be 
analyzed using an ANCOVA model including factors of treatment and adjusting for the baseline values and the stratification variables.  For analyses of changes from Baseline variables, both LOCF and OC analyses will be performed.  The LOCF analysis is considered primary for inferential purposes.  In addition, Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) will be applied, wherever appropriate, as a sensitivity analysis for the longitudinal continuous endpoints.
8.1.4.3 Efficacy Variables for Maintenance Study
For categorical endpoints, the difference in proportions of subjects between treatment 
groups will be analyzed using the CMH test adjusted for stratification variables.  Additionally, the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions will be provided.  The non-responder imputation will be used for subjects with missing data at the endpoint evaluated.  The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method will also be used as the sensitivity analyses for th e primary and ranked secondary endpoints.
Change from Baseline in continuous ranked and non-ranked secondary endpoints will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model including factors of treatment and adjusting for the baseline values and the stratification variables.  For analyses of changes from Baseline

variables, both LOCF and OC analyses w ill be performed.  The LOCF analysis is 
considered primary for inferential purposes.  In addition, Mixed-Effect Model Repeated 
Measure (MMRM) will be applied, wherever appropriate, as a sensitivity analysis for the longitudinal continuous endpoints.
8.1.5 Statistical Analyses of Safety
Adverse events (AEs), laboratory data and vital signs are the primary safety parameters in 
this study.  All safety comparisons will be performed for both induction and maintenance periods between treatment groups using the safety analysis set.
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as events that begin or worsen either on or after the 
first dose of the study drug and within 70 days after the last dose of the study drug for subjects who do not participate in the OLE or until first dose of study drug in the OLE study if the subject is a completer and is enrolled in the OLE.
Treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized separately for:  a) Baseline to Week 12; 
b) Week 12 to Week 56; c) Baseline to Week 56 (overall study duration).  An overview of treatment-emergent AEs, including AEs of special interest such as adverse events leading 
to death and adverse events leading to premature discontinuation (see details in the SAP), AEs by Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (M edDRA version 20.1 or 
later) preferred term and system organ class, AEs by maximum relationship to study drug, 
and AEs by maximum severity will be su mmarized by number and percentage.  
Changes in laboratory data will be described using statistical characteristics and compared 
between treatment groups will be performed using a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).  In addition, shift tables and listings will be provided for abnormal values, whereby the normal range of the analyzing laboratory  will be used.  Vital signs will be 
analyzed similarly.
8.1.6 Other Statistical Analyses of Efficacy
The subgroups listed below will be used in subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint.

8.1.7 Interim Analysis
An interim analysis of the primary endpoint and ranked secondary efficacy variables for 
the Induction Study only as well as safety data collected from Baseline through double-blind Week 12 may be performed after the last subject in ITT population completes the 12-week double-blind Induction Study.  A database cut will be performed and any discrepant data will be clarified before the lock.  Since this interim analysis is the only and final analysis of the co-primary efficacy endpoints of the Induction Study, multiplicity adjustment is deemed not necessary.

8.1.8 Pharmacokinetic Analyses
Adalimumab trough serum concentrations will be summarized by dose at each time point 
using descriptive statistics.  In addition, pharmacokinetic model based analyses will be performed with the focus on apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of adalimumab.  The relationship between adalimumab concentrations and clinical response will be determined as appropriate.
AAA will be evaluated for each subject and each dose, and rates of AAA positive will be 
calculated.  As appropriate, the effect of AAA on adalimumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy variable(s), and treatment-emergent adverse events may be evaluated.  HACA w ill be 
evaluated for each subject and each dose, and rates of HACA positive will be calculated.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
The calculated Week 4 remission rate for higher dose regimen are based on the average of 
the PK-PD Linear model and E
maxmodel and is 56% [(70% [Linear] + 42% [E max]) / 2] 
for infliximab naïve subjects and 45% [(60% [Linear] + 30% [E max]) / 2] for infliximab 
experienced subjects.  Assuming the ratio in the proposed study of infliximab naïve subjects versus infliximab experienced is 75% versus 25%, respectively, the weighted Week 4 remission rate will be approximately 50% for higher induction dose regimen.  For the standard dose regimen, the Week 4 clinical remission rate will be approximately 30%.  Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study and randomized in a 3:2 ratio at Baseline to receive a higher induction adalimumab regimen or standard induction adalimumab regimen during the double-blind period.  A sample size of 500 (300 higher dose and 200 standard dose) will 
be adequate to detect at least a 20% treatment difference in clinical remission rates at Week 4 between the dosing regimens using Fisher's exact test with 99% power at a 0.05 two-sided significant level.
Since exposure/endoscopic relationships are not currently available for adalimumab, 
clinical remission will be based on PK/PD modeling which predicts a ~50% increase in the proportion of subjects with endoscopic response is expected.  The observed rate of
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
120
endoscopic response in Study M05-769 was 44% at Week 12 with the currently approved 
dosing regimen.  Thus, by extrapolation, the expected rate endoscopic response at Week 12 using the higher induction regimen is 66%.  A sample size of 500 subjects (300 higher induction regimen and 200 standard induction regimen) will be adequate to detect at least an 22% treatment difference in endoscopic response rates at Week 12 between the dosing regimens using Fisher's exact test with approximately 99% power at a 0.05 two-sided si gnificance level.
Since the clinical remission at Week 4 endpoint and the endoscopic response at Week 12 endpoint are likely not independent of each other, the power for the co-primary endpoints for the study is expected to be > 98%.
8.3 Randomization Methods
At Baseline, subjects will be randomized 3:2 to one of two double-blinded adalimumab 
Induction Study regimens (higher induction regimen or standard induction regimen).  The randomizatio n will be stratified by hs-CRP at Bas eline (< 10 and ≥ 10 mg/L), using 
Screening hs-CRP values, prior infliximab use, Crohn's disease severity (CDAI ≤ 300, 
> 300) at Baseline.  
At Week 12, subjects will be re-randomized in  a 1:1 ratio to one  of two doubl e-blinded 
exploratory tr eatment re gimens (clinically adjusted [CA] regimen and adalimumab 
therapeutic drug monitoring [TDM] regimen).  The re-ra ndomization at Week 12 will be 
stratified by induction treatment regimen, clinical response (CR-70) status at Week 12, 
and decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline p er the site investigator reading at Week 
12.  Among subjects achieving SES-CD > 50% from Baseline at Week 12, the randomizatio n will be further stratified by achiev ement of an SES-CD ≤ 4 and at least a 
2 point reduction versus baseline and no subsc ore greater than 1 in any individual variable 
using the Week 12 SES-CD value provided by the site.
The randomization schedule w ill be prepared by the Statistics Department of AbbVie.

9.0 Ethics
9.1 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requires that the clinical protocol, any protocol 
amendments, the Investigator's Brochure, the informed consent and all other forms of subject information related to the study (e.g., advertisements used to recruit subjects) and any other necessary documents be reviewed by an IEC/IRB.  The IEC/IRB will review the ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted.  IEC/IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent and subject information and/or advertising, as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a study site.
Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/IRB approval prior to implementation 
of any changes made to the study design.  The investigator will be required to submit, maintain and archive study essential documents according to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) GCP.
Any serious adverse events that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated by local 
regulations, will be reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory Agencies, as required by local regulations.  During the conduct of the study, the investigator should promptly provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports, and any additional reports required by local regulations) to the IEC/IRB of any changes that affect the conduct of the study and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation of the submission to the IEC/IRB should also be provided to AbbVie.
9.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, ICH guidelines, applicable 
regulations and guidelines governing clinical study conduct and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  Responsibilities of the clinical investigator are specified in Appendix A .
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
122
9.3 Subject Information and Consent
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject, and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to any study-related screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be reviewed and signed and dated by the subject, the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements.  A copy of the informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record.  An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the study can be found in the informed consent form.
Any optional testing will only be performed if the subject has voluntarily signed and dated 
a separate informed consent, approved by an IRB/IEC, after the nature of the testing has been explained and the subject has had an opportunity to ask questions.  The separate 
informed consent must be signed before the optional testing is performed.  If the subject 
does not consent to the optional testing, it will not impact the subject's participation in the study.
In the event a subject withdraws consent to participate from the study, stored biomarker 
and optional samples will continue to be used for research and analysis.  In the event that a subject would like to withdraw consent for research using these samples, the subject may request that their samples not be analyzed.  Once AbbVie receives the request, remaining biomarker and/or optional samples will be destroyed.  However, if the subject changes his/her consent, and the samples have already been tested, those results will remain as part of the overall research data.

to a server.  The data on the server will be considered source documentation, and maintained and managed by CRF Health.
Internet access to the ePRO data will be provided by CRF Health for the duration of the 
trial.  This access will be available for the duration of the trial to the investigational sites, as well as delegated personnel.  Such access will be removed from investigational sites following the receipt of the study archive.  Data from the ePRO tool will be archived on appropriate data media (CD-ROM, etc.) and provided to the investigational site at that time as a durable record of the site's ePRO data.  It will be possible for the investigational site to create paper print-outs from that media. 
The ePRO data (Bristol Stool Form scale, number of liquid or very soft stools, use of 
medications used for endoscopy preparation, dosing information, and general well-being) will be collected electronic ally via a handh eld device into which the patient will record 
the required pieces of information on a daily  basis.  The electronic device will be 
programmed to allow for data entry once per day.  All data entered on the device will be immediately stored to the device itself and manually/automat ically uploaded to a central 
server administrated by CRF Health.  The inve stigational site staff will be able to access

10.4 Data Collection Process
AbbVie is using an Electronic Patient Reported Outcome (ePRO) tool to capture portions 
of the clinical data defined in this protocol.  The use of ePRO requires certain process changes compared to the use of traditional paper PROs.  Trial-Specific Guidelines (T-SGs) have been developed to document the changes from the traditional paper PRO process.  These T-SGs govern the ePRO processes in this trial.
11.0 Data Quality Assurance
Prior to the initiation of the study, a meeting will be held with AbbVie personnel, the Investigators and appropriate site personnel.  This meeting will include a detailed discussion of the protocol, performance of study procedures, eCRF, Subject Questionnaires and Subject Dosi ng Diary completion, and specimen co llection methods.
Sites will be monitored throughout the study and 100% source document verification will be performed.
All data entered in the database will be verified at AbbVie.  Any discrepancies will be 
reviewed and necessary corrections will be made to the eCRF by the site.  The data will 
be reviewed and computer electronic logic checks will be run to identify items such as inconsistent study dates.  A manual review of selected line listings will also be performed 
throughout and at the end of the study.
The data from the central laboratory analyses will be electronically transferred from the 
central laboratory to the study database.  A review of all laboratory results will be 
conducted by the AbbVie monitors (or their representatives), the Study Investigator and other appropriate personnel from AbbVie.  A final review of all laboratory results will be conducted by a physician and clinical review team at AbbVie.

●cotton ball or gauze pad(s)

Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
153
If you do not have all of the items you need to give y ourself an injecti on, call your study 
physician.  Use only the items provided in the box your adalimumab comes in.
●Make sure the liquid in the prefilled syringe is clear and colorless.  Do not use 
a prefilled syringe if the liquid is cloudy or discolored or has flakes or particles 
in it.
●Have a special sharps (puncture proof) container nearby for disposing of used needles and syringes.
For your protection, it is  important that y ou follow these instructions.
2. Choosing and preparing an injection site
●Wash your hands well.
●Choose a site on the front of your thighs  or your stomach area (abdomen).  If 
you choose your abdomen, you should avoid the area 2 inches around your 
belly button (navel).
●Choose a different site each t ime you give y ourself an injection.  Each new 
injection should be  given at least one inch from a site you used before.  Never 
inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard or where you have scars or stretch marks.
●If you have psoriasis, you should try not  to inject directly into any raised, 
thick, red or scaly skin patches or lesions.

Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
154
●You may find it helpful to keep notes on the location of your injection sites.
●Wipe the site where adalimumab is to be injected with an alcohol prep (swab), 
using a circular motion.  Do not touch this area again until you are ready to 
inject.
3. How to prepare your adalimumab dose for injection with a Prefilled Syringe
●Hold the syringe upright with the needle facing down.  Check to make sure that the amount of liquid in the syringe is the same or close to the 0.8 mL line for the 40 mg prefilled syringe.  The top of the liquid may be curved.  If the 
syringe does not have the correct amount of liquid, do not use that syringe.  
Call your study doctor.
●Remove the needle cover taking care not to touch the needle with your fingers or allow it to touch any surface.
●Turn the syringe so the needle is facing up and slowly push the plunger in to push the air in the syringe out through the needle.  If a small drop of liquid 
comes out of the needle that is okay.
●Do not shake the syringe.
Adalimumab
M14-115 Protocol Amendment 6EudraCT 2013-001746-33
155
4. Injecting Adalimumab
●With your other hand, gently squeeze an area of the cleaned area of skin and 
hold it firmly.
●You will inject into this raised area of skin.  Hold the syringe like a pencil at about a 45° angle (see picture) to the skin.
●With a quick, short, "dart-like" motion, push the needle into the skin.
●After the needle is in, let go of the skin.  Pull back slightly on the plunger.  If blood appears in the syringe it means that you have entered a blood vessel.  Do 
not inject adalimumab.  Pull the needle out of the skin and repeat the steps to 
choose and clean a new injection site.  Do not use the same syringe.  Dispose of it in your special sharps containe r.  If no blood appears, slowly push the 
plunger all the way in until all of the adalimumab is injected.
●When the syringe is empty, remove the needle from the skin keeping it at the 
same angle it was when it was pushed into the skin.
●Press a cotton ball or gauze pad over the injection site and hold it for 
10 seconds.  Do not rub the injection site.  You may have slight bleeding.  This is normal.
●Dispose of the syringe right away into your special sharps container.

Section 1.2  Synopsis
Previously read:
AbbVie Inc. Protocol Number:   M14-115
Name of Study Drug:   Adalimumab Phase of Development:   3
Name of Active Ingredient:   Adalimumab Date of Protocol Synopsis:   20 March 2017
Protocol Title:   A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind Study to Evaluate Higher Versus Standard 
Adalimumab Dosing Regimens for Induction and Maintenance Therapy in Subjects with Moderately to 
Severely Active Crohn's Disease and Evidence of Mucosal Ulceration
Objectives:
The objective of Study M14-115 is to evaluate efficacy and safety of higher induction and maintenance 
dosing regimens in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.
Investigators:   Multicenter
Study Sites:   Approximately 150 sites worldwide.
Study Population:   Males and females ≥ 18 and ≤  75 years of age with a diagnosis of moderately to 
severely active Crohn's disease, CDAI ≥ 220 and ≤  450, and evidence of mucosal ulceration by Simple 
Endoscopic Score (SES-CD) ≥ 6, excluding the presence of narrowing component, or SES-CD ≥ 4, 
excluding the presence of narrowing component, for patients with disease limited to the ileum, on screening endoscopy (or endoscopy performed within 45 days before Baseline), confirmed by a central reader.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 600 (360 in higher induction regimen group and 
240 in standard induction regimen group) subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's Disease, CDAI of ≥ 220 and ≤  450 and evidence of mucosal ulceration, confirmed by centrally read endoscopy.
Methodology:
This Phase 3 study design includes the Screening Period followed by a 12-Week double-blind Induction 
Study and 44-Week double-blind Maintenance Study.  The Induction Study will assess the efficacy and 
safety of two adalimumab induction regimens in achieving clinical remission, defined as Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) < 150 at Week 4, and endoscopic improvement, defined as Simplified Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) ≤ 4 and at least a 2 point reduction versus baseline and no subscore 
greater than 1 in any individual variable at Week 12, in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and evidence of mucosal ulceration at Baseline.
The Maintenance Study will assess the efficacy and safety of two adalimumab maintenance regimens in 
maintaining clinical and endoscopic improvements at Week 56.  Analyses of the outcomes from the maintenance regimens are considered exploratory.
During both the Induction Study and the Maintenance Study, visit week designations will represent 
weeks since first dose in the Induction Study.  Week 0 (Baseline) will reflect the date of first adalimumab dosing in the Induction Study.  Week 12 will represent the final assessment in the Induction Study. Week 56 w ill represent the final assessment in the Maintenance Study (representing 44 weeks of 
maintenance treatment in the Maintenance Study).

Methodology (Continued):
Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the 
study and randomized in a 3:2 ratio at Baseline to receive a higher induction adalimumab regimen or standard induction adalimumab regimen during the double-blind Induction Study.  Up to 25% of subjects with previous infliximab exposure may be enrolled.  All subjects who complete the Induction Study (regardless of achievement of response at Week 12) will continue into the Maintenance Study.  Assuming the Week 4 clinical remission rate will be approximately 50% for the higher induction dose regimen and approximately 30% for the standard dose regimen, a sample size of 600 (360 higher dose and 240 standard dose) will be adequate to detect at least a 20% treatment difference in clinical remission rates at Week 4 between the dosing regimens using Fisher's exact test with 99% power at a 0.05 two-sided si gnificant level.
Since exposure/endoscopic relationships are not currently available for adalimumab, clinical remission will be based on PK/PD modeling which predicts an expected ~50% increase in the proportion of subjects with endoscopic improvement compared to the standard adalimumab induction regimen.  The observed rate of SES-CD ≤ 4 in Study M05-769 was 37% at Week 12 with the currently approved dosing 
regimen.  Thus, by extrapolation, the expected rate for SES-CD ≤ 4 at Week 12 using the higher 
induction regimen is 55%.  A sample size of 600 subjects (360 higher induction regimen and 240 standard induction regimen) will be adequate to detect at least an 18% treatment difference in endoscopic improvement rates at Week 12 between the dosing regimens using Fisher's exact test with approximately 98% power at a 0.05 two-sided significance level.
Since clinical remission at the Week 4 endpoint and the endoscopic improvement at the Week 12 
endpoint are not likely to be independent of each other, the power for the co-primary endpoints for the Induction Study is expected to be > 97% (see protocol for detailed assumptions of the sample size calculation).
The randomization of subjects for the Induction Study w ill be stratified by hi gh-sensitivity C-Reactive 
Protein (hs-CRP) at Baseline (< 10 and ≥ 10 mg/L), using the Screening hs-CRP value, prior infliximab 
use, and Crohn's disease activity (CDAI ≤ 300, > 300) at Baseline.  Subjects with prior infliximab 
experience will be limited to 25% of the study population.  Subjects assigned to the higher induction 
regimen will receive blinded adalimumab 160 mg at Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, and Week 3.  At Week 4, subjects will receive adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow) through Week 12.  Subjects assigned to the standard induction regimen will receive blinded adalimumab 160 mg at Baseline and matching placebo at Week 1, adalimumab 80 mg at Week 2 and matching placebo at Week 3.  At Week 4, subjects will receive adalimumab 40 mg every other week through Week 12.
Maintenance Study:
At Week 12, subjects will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two double-blinded exploratory 
treatment regimens (adalimumab clinically adjusted [CA] regimen and adalimumab therapeutic drug monitoring [TDM] regimen).  The re-randomization at Week 12 will be stratified by induction treatment regimen, clinical response (CR-70) status at Week 12 and endoscopic response status (decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline) per the site investigator reading at Week 12.  Among Week 12 endoscopic responders, the randomization will be further stratified by endoscopic improvement, defined as achievement of an SES-CD ≤ 4 and at least a 2 point reduction versus baseline and no subscore greater 
than 1 in any individual variable using the Week 12 SES-CD value provided by the site.

Methodology (Continued):
Clinically Adjusted (CA) Regimen:
Subjects randomized to the clinically adjusted regimen will receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week 
beginning at Week 12.  The adalimumab dose will be escalated to every week (ew) as early as Week 14 if the subject's CDAI ≥ 220 or hs-CRP ≥ 10 mg/L (using results from the prior or current visit) as shown by 
the dose adjustment criteria below.  These subjects will also be allowed to escalate at unscheduled visits that may occur only on Weeks 16, 18, 22, 24, 30, 32, 36, 38, 44, 46, 50, 52 and 54.  Once subjects in the clinically adjusted regimen are escalated, they will remain on 40 mg ew dosing.
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) Regimen:
At Weeks 14, 28 and 42, the adalimumab dose for subjects randomized to the TDM will be determined 
by the dose adjustment criteria referenced in the table below.  Doses will be determined using blinded serum concentrations at the prior visit (Weeks 12, 26 and 40, respectively) as well as the CDAI or hs-CRP values from the current or prior visit.  For subjects who meet criteria for dose escalation at Weeks 14, 28 or 42, subjects will receive 40 mg weekly.
The goal of the TDM regimen is to attain and maintain serum adalimumab levels above a reasonably high 
concentration levels in subjects for mucosal healing.  Since exposure-endoscopic relationships are not currently available for adalimumab, clinical remission wa s used for selection of concentration threshold 
to be used in TDM arm.  Based on the PK analyses of concentrations in Studies M02-403, M04-691 and M02-433, no concentration level could be identified as significant and reliable predictor of remission in adult CD.  Therefore, the TDM regimen will be based on two concentration thresholds in conjunction with clinical response criteria as expected to occur in clinical setting.  About 75% of the subjects who were in remission at Week 56 in Study M02-433 had serum concentration above 5 μg/mL.  Therefore, the 
lower concentration threshold for the TDM regimen was selected as 5 μg/mL and any subject below 
5μg/mL concentration will be escalated to ew dosing.  The second threshold was selected as 10 μg/mL, 
which is similar to the median concentrations (9.4 μg/mL at Week 56) observed in subjects who were in 
remission.  The subjects with concentration above 5 and below 10 μg/mL may be dose escalated based on 
clinical response as outlined in the table below.  The subjects with serum concentration above 10 μg/mL 
will not be dose escalated.

The duration of the study could be up to 60 weeks which includes a Screening Period (1 – 4 weeks), a 
12-week double-bli nd Induction Study and a 44-week Maintenance Study.  The Screening Period may be 
extended as necessary after consultation with and approval by the AbbVie Study Designated Physician (SDP) for subjects who require initiation of prophylactic anti-tuberculosis (TB) therapy, or in case of external, not subject-related circumstances (e.g., due to delay of availability of screening test results).  There will also be a 70-day follow-up phone call for subjects who complete Week 56 or discontinue from the study prematurely.
Clinical evaluation will occur at Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 20, 26, 28, 34, 40, 42, 48, and 
56/Premature Discontinuation (PD) visits.  An electronic diary will be dispensed at the Screening visit.  In addition to routine physical examination, CDAI calculation, diary review, laboratory, adverse event, concomitant medication and vital sign assessments, the following will be collected:
!Results of study questionnaires (IBDQ, EQ-5D, WPAI) at Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, 
Week 26, Week 40 and Week 56/PD.
!Calculation of the SFPS at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, Week 14,

!An optional pharmacogenetic sample should be drawn at Baseline and Week 12.
Throughout the study, subjects will only be allowed to change the dosage of CD-specific concomitant 
medications as specified below:
!At Week 4, subjects who are taking corticosteroid therapy at Baseline will have their corticosteroid therapy tapered according to a tapering schedule specified in the clinical study protocol.  If the Investigator feels that the steroid taper is not advisable for a particular subject at Week 4, the Study Designated Physician (SDP) should be consulted for evaluation and approval.
!Subjects taking corticosteroids at Baseline who have a loss of satisfactory clinical response per 
the Investigator's judgment after the steroid taper has been initiated may have their corticosteroid dose increased per the Investigator's discretion during the study.  Subjects in whom the maximum equivalent steroid dose exceeds the dose used at Baseline will be censored for efficacy assessments (i.e., they will be considered non-responders for categorical endpoints 
and will have Baseline values carried forward for non-categorical assessments) from that point 
forward.  These subjects will continue to be evaluated in the safety population.
!Immunosuppressant doses may be decreased or terminated in the event of moderate-to-severe treatment-related toxicities.

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Pharmacokinetic:
Blood samples will be collected for measurement of serum adalimumab concentration just prior to dosing 
at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, and Week 56/Premature Discontinuation and anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) just prior to dosing at Baseline, Week 4, Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, and Week 56PD.
Blood samples will also be collected for measurement of infliximab serum levels and Human 
Anti-Chimeric Antibodies (HACA) just prior to dosing at Baseline.
Exploratory Research Using Intestinal Mucosal Biopsy Samples (Optional):
Optional intestinal biopsies will be collected with consent at Screening, Week 12, and Week 56 or at 
premature discontinuation.  The purpose of these samples is to test potential biomarker signatures and new drug targets for IBD.  Assessments will include but may not be limited to nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites or lipids.
Safety:
Safety analyses will be performed on all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.  Incidence 
of adverse events, changes in vital signs, physical examination results, and clinical laboratory data will be assessed.
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
The co-primary efficacy variables for the Induction Study are proportion of subjects with moderately to 
severely active CD that have achieved clinical remission, defined as CDAI < 150, at Week 4 and 
proportion of subjects with moderately to severely active CD that have achieved endoscopic improvement defined as an SES-CD ≤ 4 and at least a 2 point reduction versus baseline and no subscore 
greater than 1 in any individual variable at Week 12. The comparison between treatment groups for the two co-primary efficacy va riables will be performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test and 
will be stratified by hs-CRP at Baseline (< 10 and ≥ 10 mg/L) (the Screening hs-CRP will serve as the 
Baseline value), prior infliximab use, and Crohn's disease severity (CDAI ≤ 300, > 300) at Baseline.  A 
CMH based two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between treatment groups will be calculated.  The ITT set includes all subjects who were randomized at baseline.  Missing CDAI at Week 4 or missing SES-CD at Week 12 w ill be imputed using the non-responder imputation (NRI) 
approach.  For Week 4 clinical remission, LOCF, OC and multiple imputation methods will be used as sensitivity analyses.  For Week 12 endoscopic improvement, LOCF and OC will be used as sensitivity analyses.
Secondary efficacy variables for the Induction Study are divided into two groups.  The first group 
includes ranked secondary endpoints, which are ranked by clinical importance.  Statistical significance is assessed at 0.050 (2-sided) in ranked endpoint order until the significance level exceeds 0.05.  No additional statistically significant treatment differences may be declared after the first ranked endpoint fails to achieve 0.05.  The second group includes all other additional secondary variables.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Efficacy (Continued):
In general, continuous secondary efficacy variables, including all efficacy variables for Maintenance 
Study, will be analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model including factor for treatment group, stratification factors and Baseline values, whereas CMH test stratified by stratification factors used for discrete data.  NRI for missing data will be used for categorical endpoints.  Both last observation carried forward (LOCF) and observed case (OC) analyses will be performed for continuous endpoint.  The LOCF analysis is considered primary for inferential purposes.  In addition, Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) will be applied, wherever appropriate, as a sensitivity analysis for the longitudinal continuous endpoints.
Pharmacokinetic:Adalimumab trough serum concentrations will be summarized by treatment group at each time point 
using descriptive statistics.  In addition, pharmacokinetic model based analyses will be performed with the focus on apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of adalimumab.
Immunogenicity:
AAA will be evaluated for each subject and each regimen, and rates of AAA positive will be calculated.  
As appropriate, the effect of AAA on adalimumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy variable(s), and treatment emergent adverse events may be evaluated.
Safety:
Adverse events (AEs), laboratory data and vital signs are the primary safety parameters in this study.  All 
safety comparisons will be performed between treatment groups using the safety set.  Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as events that begin or worsen either on or after the first dose of the study drug and within 70 days after the last dose of the study drug for subjects who do not participate in the OLE or until first dose of study drug in the OLE study if the subject is a study completer and is enrolled in the OLE.  Treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized separately for:  a) Baseline to Week 12; b) Week 12 to Week 56; c) Baseline to Week 56 (overall study duration).  An overview of 
treatment-emergent AEs, including AEs of special interest such as adverse events leading to death and adverse events leading to premature discontinuation (see details in the SAP), AEs by Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version 15.1 or later) preferred term and system organ class, AEs by maximum relationship to study drug, and AEs by maximum severity will be summarized by number and percentage.  Treatment group differences in the overall incidence of treatment-emergent AEs will be assessed with Fisher's exact test for each preferred term.
Changes in laboratory data will be described using statistical characteristics and compared 
between-treatment groups will be performed using a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).  In addition, shift tables and listings will be provided for abnormal values, whereby the normal range of the analyzing laboratory will be used.  Vital signs will be analyzed similarly.

Name of Active Ingredient:   Adalimumab Date of Protocol Synopsis:   27 November 2018
Protocol Title:   A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind Study to Evaluate Higher Versus Standard 
Adalimumab Dosing Regimens for Induction and Maintenance Therapy in Subjects with Moderately to 
Severely Active Crohn's Disease and Evidence of Mucosal Ulceration
Objectives:
The objective of Study M14-115 is to evaluate efficacy and safety of higher induction and maintenance 
dosing regimens in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.
Investigators:   Multicenter
Study Sites:   Approximately 150 sites worldwide.
Study Population:   Males and females ≥ 18 and ≤  75 years of age with a diagnosis of moderately to 
severely active Crohn's disease, CDAI ≥ 220 and ≤  450, and evidence of mucosal ulceration by Simple 
Endoscopic Score (SES-CD) ≥ 6, excluding the presence of narrowing component, or SES-CD ≥ 4, 
excluding the presence of narrowing component, for patients with disease limited to the ileum, on screening endoscopy (or endoscopy performed within 45 days before Baseline), confirmed by a central reader.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 500 (300 in higher induction regimen group and 
200 in standard induction regimen group) subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's Disease, CDAI of ≥ 220 and ≤  450 and evidence of mucosal ulceration, confirmed by centrally read endosc opy.
Methodology:
This Phase 3 study design includes the Screening Period followed by a 12-Week double-blind Induction 
Study and 44-Week double-blind Maintenance Study.  The Induction Study will assess the efficacy and 
safety of two adalimumab induction regimens in achieving clinical remission, defined as Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) < 150 at Week 4, and endoscopic response, defined as a decrease in Simplified Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) > 50% from Baseline (or for a Baseline SES-CD of 4, at least a 2 point reduction from Baseline), as scored by central reviewer, at Week 12; in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and evidence of mucosal ulceration at Baseline.
The Maintenance Study will assess the efficacy a nd safety of two adalimumab maintenance regimens in 
maintaining clinical and endoscopic improvements at Week 56.  Analyses of the outcomes from the 
maintenance regimens are considered exploratory.
During both the Induction Study and the Maintenance Study, visit week designations will represent 
weeks since first dose in the Induction Study.  Week 0 (Baseline) will reflect the date of first adalimumab dosing in the Induction Study.  Week 12 will represent the final assessment in the Induction Study.  Week 56 w ill represent the final assessment in the Maintenance Study (representing 44 weeks of 
maintenance treatment in the Maintenance Study).

Methodology (Continued):
Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the 
study and randomized in a 3:2 ratio at Baseline to receive a higher induction adalimumab regimen or standard induction adalimumab regimen during the double-blind Induction Study.  Up to 25% of subjects with previous infliximab exposure may be enrolled.  All subjects who complete the Induction Study (regardless of achievement of response at Week 12) will continue into the Maintenance Study.  Assuming the Week 4 clinical remission rate will be approximately 50% for the higher induction dose regimen and approximately 30% for the standard dose regimen, a sample size of 500 (300 higher dose and 200 standard dose) will be adequate to detect at least a 20% treatment difference in clinical remission rates at Week 4 between the dosing regimens using Fisher's exact test with 99% power at a 0.05 two-sided si gnificant level.
Since exposure/endoscopic relationships are not currently available for adalimumab, clinical remission will be based on PK/PD modeling which predicts an expected ~50% increase in the proportion of subjects with endoscopic response compared to the standard adalimumab induction regimen.  The observed rate of endoscopic response in Study M05-769 was 44% at Week 12 with the currently approved dosing regimen.  Thus, by extrapolation, the expected rate for endoscopic response at Week 12 using the higher induction regimen is 66%.  A sample size of 500 subjects (300 higher induction regimen and 200 standard induction regimen) will be adequate to detect at least a 22% treatment difference in endoscopic response rates at Week 12 between the dosing regimens using Fisher's exact test with approximately 99% power at a 0.05 two-sided significance level.
Since clinical remission at the Week 4 endpoint and the endoscopic response at the Week 12 endpoint are 
not likely to be independent of each other, the power for the co- primary endpoints for the Induction Study 
is expected to be > 98% (see protocol for detailed assumptions of the sample size calculation).
The randomization of subjects for the Induction Study will be stratified by high-sensitivity C-Reactive 
Protein (hs-CRP) at Baseline (< 10 and ≥ 10 mg/L), using the Screening hs-CRP value, prior infliximab 
use, and Crohn's disease activity (CDAI ≤ 300, > 300) at Baseline.  Subjects with pri or infliximab 
experience will be limited to 25% of the study population.  Subjects assigned to the higher induction 
regimen will receive blinded adalimumab 160 mg at Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, and Week 3.  At Week 4, subjects will receive adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow) through Week 12.  Subjects assigned to the standard induction regimen will receive blinded adalimumab 160 mg at Baseline and matching placebo at Week 1, adalimumab 80 mg at Week 2 and matching placebo at Week 3.  At Week 4, subjects will receive adalimumab 40 mg every other week through Week 12.
Maintenance Study:
At Week 12, subjects will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two double-blinded exploratory 
treatment regimens (adalimumab clinically adjusted [CA] regimen and adalimumab therapeutic drug monitoring [TDM] regimen).  The re-randomization at Week 12 will be stratified by induction treatment regimen, clinical response (CR-70) status at Week 12 and decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline per the site investigator reading at Week 12.  Among subjects achieving SES-CD > 50% from Baseline at Week 12, the randomization will be further stratified by SES-CD ≤ 4 and at least a 2 point reduction 
versus baseline and no subscore greater than 1 in any individual variable using the Week 12 SES-CD value provided by the site.

Methodology (Continued):
Clinically Adjusted (CA) Regimen:
Subjects randomized to the clinically adjusted regimen will receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week 
beginning at Week 12.  The adalimumab dose will be escalated to every week (ew) as early as Week 14 if the subject's CDAI ≥ 220 or hs-CRP ≥ 10 mg/L (using results from the prior or current visit) as shown by 
the dose adjustment criteria below.  These subjects will also be allowed to escalate at unscheduled visits that may occur only on Weeks 16, 18, 22, 24, 30, 32, 36, 38, 44, 46, 50, 52 and 54.  Once subjects in the clinically adjusted regimen are escalated, they will remain on 40 mg ew dosing.
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) Regimen:
At Weeks 14, 28 and 42, the adalimumab dose for subjects randomized to the TDM will be determined 
by the dose adjustment criteria referenced in the table below.  Doses will be determined using blinded serum concentrations at the prior visit (Weeks 12, 26 and 40, respectively) as well as the CDAI or hs-CRP values from the current or prior visit.  For subjects who meet criteria for dose escalation at Weeks 14, 28 or 42, subjects will receive 40 mg weekly.
The goal of the TDM regimen is to attain and maintain serum adalimumab levels above a reasonably high 
concentration levels in subjects for mucosal healing.  Since exposure-endoscopic relationships are not currently available for adalimumab, clinical remission was used for selection of concentration threshold to be used in TDM arm.  Based on the PK analyses of concentrations in Studies M02-403, M04-691 and M02-433, no concentration level could be identified as significant and reliable predictor of remission in adult CD.  Therefore, the TDM regimen will be based on two concentration thresholds in conjunction with clinical response criteria as expected to occur in clinical setting.  About 75% of the subjects who were in remission at Week 56 in Study M02-433 had serum concentration above 5 μ g/mL.  Therefore, the 
lower concentration threshold for the TDM regimen was selected as 5 μ g/mL and any subject below 
5μg/mL concentration will be escalated to ew dosing.  The second threshold was selected as 10 μg/mL, 
which is similar to the median concentrations (9.4 μg/mL at Week 56) observed in subjects who were in 
remission.  The subjects with concentration above 5 and below 10 μg/mL may be dose escalated based on 
clinical response as outlined in the table below.  The subjects with serum concentration above 10 μg/mL 
will not be dose escalated.

The duration of the study could be up to 60 weeks which includes a Screening Period (1 – 4 weeks), a 
12-week double-blind Induction Study and a 44-week Maintenance Study.  The Screening Period may be extended as necessary after consultation with and approval by the AbbVie Study Designated Physician (SDP) for subjects who require initiation of prophylactic anti-tuberculosis (TB) therapy, or in case of external, not subject-related circumstances (e.g., due to delay of availability of screening test results).  There will also be a 70-day follow-up phone call for subjects who complete Week 56 or discontinue from the study prematurely.
Clinical evaluation will occur at Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 20, 26, 28, 34, 40, 42, 48, and 
56/Premature Discontinuation (PD) visits.  An electronic diary will be dispensed at the Screening visit.  In addition to routine physical examination, CDAI calculation, diary review, laboratory, adverse event, concomitant medication and vital sign assessments, the following will be collected:
!Results of study questionnaires (IBDQ, EQ-5D, WPAI) at Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, 
Week 26, Week 40 and Week 56/PD.
!Calculation of the SFPS at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, Week 14, 
Week 20, Week 26, Week 28, Week 34, Week 40, Week 42, Week 48 and Week 56/PD.  The 
Screening visit results will serve as the Baseline value.
!Results of daily Bristol Stool Form Scale beginning at Baseline through Week 56/PD.
!Results of 11-point Abdominal Pain Rating Scale beginning at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, 
Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, and Week 56/PD.
!Serum for measurement of adalimumab concentrations just prior to dosing at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, and Week 56/PD.

!Endoscopic evaluations, confirmed by central reader, will be done at Screening, Week 12, and Week 56/PD.
!An optional pharmacogenetic sample should be drawn at Baseline and Week 12.
Throughout the study, subjects will only be allowed to change the dosage of CD-specific concomitant 
medications as specified below:
!At Week 4, subjects who are taking corticosteroid therapy at Baseline will have their corticosteroid therapy tapered according to a tapering schedule specified in the clinical study protocol.  If the Investigator feels that the steroid taper is not advisable for a particular subject at Week 4, the Study Designated Physician (SDP) should be consulted for evaluation and approval.
!Subjects taking corticosteroids at Baseline who have a loss of satisfactory clinical response per 
the Investigator's judgment after the steroid taper has been initiated may have their corticosteroid dose increased per the Investigator's discretion during the study.  Subjects in whom the maximum equivalent steroid dose exceeds the dose used at Baseline will be censored for efficacy assessments (i.e., they will be considered non-responders for categorical endpoints 
and will have the last non-missing values carried forward for non-categorical assessments) from 
that point forward.  These subjects will continue to be evaluated in the safety population.
!Immunosuppressant doses may be decreased or terminated in the event of moderate-to-severe treatment-related toxicities.

Investigational Products: Adalimumab (40 mg/0.8 mL)
Double-Blind Induction Subjects will be randomized to receive one of 2 double-blind 
adalimumab Induction Study regimens.
Doses: (Higher Induction Regimen)
160 mg at Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, and 3, and 40 mg at Week 4, continuing 
at 40 mg every other week through Week 12.
(Standard Induction Regimen)160 mg at Baseline and matching placebo at Week 1, 80 mg at Week 2 
and matching placebo at Week 3 and 40 mg every other week beginning at Week 4 through Week 12.
Double-Blind Maintenance Subjects will receive one of two double-blind adalimumab Maintenance Study regimens.
Doses:
NOTE:   In order to retain 
blinding across regimens, all 
subjects who do not meet the criteria for dose escalation in either maintenance regimen will receive matching placebo injections in addition to the adalimumab injection.Clinically Adjusted (CA) Regimen:
Subjects randomized to the clinically adjusted regimen will receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week beginning at Week 12.  The adalimumab dose will be escalated to every week starting at Week 14 if CDAI is ≥ 220 or hs-CRP ≥ 10 mg/L (using results from the prior or 
current visit) as shown by the dose adjustment criteria table.  These subjects will also be allowed to escalate at unscheduled visits that may occur only on Weeks 16, 18, 22, 24, 30, 32, 36, 38, 44, 46, 50, 52 and 54.  Once subjects in the clinically adjusted regimen are escalated, they will remain on 40 mg ew dosing.
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) Regimen:
At Weeks 14, 28 and 42, the adalimumab dose for subjects randomized 
to the TDM regimen will be determined by the dose adjustment criteria table.  Doses will be determined using blinded serum concentrations at the prior visit (Weeks 12, 26 and 40, respectively) as well as the CDAI or hs-CRP values from the current or prior visit.  For subjects who meet criteria for dose escalation at Weeks 14, 28 or 42, subjects will receive 40 mg weekly.
Mode of Administration: Subcutaneous (SC)
Duration of Treatment:
The study will include a Screening Period of 1 – 4 weeks, a double-blind Induction Study of 12 weeks,
and a double-blind Maintenance Study of 44 weeks.  There will also be a 70 -day follow-up phone call for 
subjects who complete the study or discontinue from the study prematurely.

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
All endpoints for the Exploratory Maintenance Study will be non-ranked.
Pharmacokinetic:
Blood samples will be collected for measurement of serum adalimumab concentration just prior to dosing 
at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, and Week 56/Premature Discontinuation and anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) just prior to dosing at Baseline, Week 4, Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, and Week 56PD.
Blood samples will also be collected for measurement of infliximab serum levels and Human 
Anti-Chimeric Antibodies (HACA) just prior to dosing at Baseline.
Exploratory Research Using Intestinal Mucosal Biopsy Samples (Optional):
Optional intestinal biopsies will be collected with consent at Screening, Week 12, and Week 56 or at 
premature discontinuation.  The purpose of these samples is to test potential biomarker signatures and new drug targets for IBD.  Assessments will include but may not be limited to nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites or lipids.
Safety:
Safety analyses will be performed on all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.  Incidence 
of adverse events, changes in vital signs, physical examination results, and clinical laboratory data will be assessed.
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
The co-primary efficacy variables for the Induction Study are proportion of subjects with moderately to 
severely active CD that have achieved clinical remission, defined as CDAI < 150, at Week 4 and 
proportion of subjects with moderately to severely active CD that have achieved a decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline (or for a Baseline SES-CD of 4, at least a 2 point reduction from Baseline), at Week 12. The co mparison between treatment groups for the two co-primary efficacy variables will be 
performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test and will be stratified by hs-CRP at Baseline (< 10 and ≥ 10 mg/L) (the Screening hs-CRP will serve as the Baseline value), prior infliximab use, and 
Crohn's disease severity (CDAI ≤ 300, > 300) at Baseline.  A CMH based two-sided 95% confidence 
interval for the difference between treatment groups will be calculated.  The ITT set includes all subjects who were randomized at baseline.  For the evaluation of co-primary endpoints, missing data of CDAI at Week 4 or missing SES-CD at Week 12 will be imputed using the non-responder imputation (NRI) 
approach.  For Week 4 clinical remission, LOCF, OC and multiple imputation methods will be used as sensitivity analyses.  For Week 12 endoscopic res ponse (decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline [or 
for a Baseline SES-CD of 4, at least a 2 point reduction from Baseline]), OC will be used as sensitivity analysis.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Efficacy (Continued):
Secondary efficacy variables for the Induction Study are divided into two groups.  The first group 
includes ranked secondary endpoints, which are ranked by clinical importance.  Statistical significance is assessed at significance level of 0.050 (2-sided) in ranked endpoint order until the significance level exceeds 0.05.  No additional statistically significant treatment differences may be declared after the first ranked endpoint fails to achieve statistical significance at a two-sided significance level of 0.05.  The second group includes all other secondary variables.
In general, continuous secondary efficacy variables, including all efficacy variables for Maintenance 
Study, will be analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model including factor for treatment group, stratification factors and Baseline values, whereas CMH test stratified by stratification factors is used for categorical endpoints.  NRI for missing data will be used for categorical endpoints.  Both last observation carried forward (LOCF) and observed case (OC) analyses will be performed for continuous endpoints.  The LOCF analysis is considered primary for inferential purposes.  In addition, Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) will be applied, wherever appropriate, as a sensitivity analysis for the longitudinal continuous endpoints.
Pharmacokinetic:
Adalimumab trough serum concentrations will be summarized by treatment group at each time point 
using descriptive statistics.  In addition, pharmacokinetic model based analyses will be performed with the focus on apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of adalimumab.
Immunogenicity:AAA will be evaluated for each subject and each regimen, and rates of AAA positive will be calculated.  
As appropriate, the effect of AAA on adalimumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy variable(s), and treatment emergent adverse events may be evaluated.
Safety:
Adverse events (AEs), laboratory data and vital signs are the primary safety parameters in this study.  All 
safety comparisons will be performed between treatment groups using the safety set.  Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as events that begin or worsen either on or after the first dose of the study drug and within 70 days after the last dose of the study drug for subjects who do not participate in the OLE or until first dose of study drug in the OLE study if the subject is a study completer and is enrolled in the OLE.  Treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized separately for:  a) Baseline to Week 12; b) Week 12 to Week 56; c) Baseline to Week 56 (overall study duration).  An overview of 
treatment-emergent AEs, including AEs of special interest, adverse events leading to death and adverse events leading to premature discontinuation (see details in the SAP), AEs by Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version 20.1 or later) preferred term and system organ class, AEs by maximum relationship to study drug, and AEs by maximum severity will be summarized by number and percentage.  
Changes in laboratory data will be described using statistical characteristics and compared 
between-treatment groups will be performed using a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).  In 
addition, shift tables and listings will be provided for abnormal values, whereby the normal range of the analyzing laboratory will be used.  Vital signs will be analyzed similarly.

Study M05-769 was 37% at Week 12 with the currently approved dosing regimen.  Thus, by extrapolation, the expected rate for SES-CD ≤ 4 using the higher induction regimen is 
55%.  A sample size of 600 subjects (360 higher induction regimen and 240 standard induction regimen) will be adequate to detect at least a 18% treatment difference in endoscopic improvement rates at Week 12 between the dosing regimens using Fisher's exact test with approximately 98% power at a 0.05 two-sided significance level.

Page 3 of 19 (V.08/27/2018 ) 1.0 Objectives  
 
1.1 Study Objectives  
The objective of this study is to determine if fluorescence lymphangiography can be used alone to 
localize sentinel nodes in patients with melanoma or breast cancer. The hypothesis is that sentinel 
nodes can be identified using only indocyanine green (ICG) and fluorescence lymphangiography, without 
the need for technetium99 and a gamma probe.  
 
1.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
The primary endpoint is the number of sentinel nodes correctly identified with ICG and fluorescen ce 
imaging alone.  
 
1.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints include adverse events related to ICG and operative time for sentinel node biopsy.  
 
 
2.0 Background  
 
1.1 Scientific Background and Gaps  
 
Sentinel node biopsy is a routine procedure in patients with both melanoma and breast cancer. The 
status of the sentinel node provides prognostic information and guides further treatment options in 
these patients. Sentinel node biopsy (SLN) was first devel oped using only a blue dye. Technetium99, a 
radioactive protein, was added later and provides the ability to image the patient and identify relevant 
lymph node basins. This feature is particularly important for trunk melanomas that can drain to multiple 
nodal basins. For the last 15 years or so, the standard method of SLN localization includes both tech99 
and blue dye. While the rates of localization overall are excellent, these methods each have drawbacks.  
 
Technetium 99 (tech99) is a radioactive protein t hat is injected dermally around the melanoma or the 
areola of the breast , usually one day prior to surgery. Lymphoscintigraphy is done 1 -2 hours after 
injection and identifies the nodal basin that contains the sentinel node. Tech99 has an excellent track 
record of identifying sentinel nodes, but it does involve an extra trip to the hospital (patients are 
injected the day prior to surgery), the injection is often the most painful part of the entire treatment 
experience, and the signal can be vague and diffic ult to localize in the operating room. Furthermore, 
there are international concerns about the reliability of the supply of radio -labelled colloid. The reactors 
that currently provide tech99 and other radioactive substances are aging, and shortages of mate rial 
have been threatened in the past.  
 
Blue dye  is injected dermally on the day of surgery, after the patient is anesthetized. This is a visual 
adjunct to the radioactive signal from the tech99. These two methods together have a success rate of 
approximat ely 96% in identifying the sentinel node. Blue dye alone localizes about 50% of sentinel 
nodes, and it  can be problematic for the surgeon in that it stains tissues and is toxic to skin grafts.  
 
Infrared lymphangiography using ICG and real time imaging has  recently been used as an alternative 
method of sentinel node identification. The PI has recently completed an equivalency trial of tech99, 
Methylene blue (MB) and ICG.  All subjects in this trial received all 3 dyes, and each was used 
simultaneously.  In this study I found that tech99 and ICG are equivalent in their ability to localize 
sentinel nodes. MB was inferior to both, and I rarely use MB in my clinical practice now. With the 
experience and results from the first trial, the next question is whether we can use ICG and fluorescence 
imaging alone, without tech99 and the gamma probe. The SPY Elite and SPY PHI machine s are FDA 
approved for perfusion imaging and are the device s used to identify the sentinel lymph nodes after 
injection of ICG.  
 
Page 4 of 19 (V.08/27/2018 )  
2.1 Previous Data  
 
Multiple centers have published their experience with fluorescence imaging to identify sentinel nodes, 
in both melanoma and breast cancer.1-4 Ballardini et al5 found that ICG and tech99 are equivalent in 
identifying sentinel nodes in patients with br east cancer, and they suggest that ICG can be used alone.  In 
our recently completed SPY trial, 89 subjects were enrolled and received tech99, MB and ICG. The 
tech99 identified a mean of 1.89 sentinel nodes per patient, ICG a mean of 1.87 and MB a mean of 0 .71 
sentinel nodes. The ICG was well tolerated, with no adverse effects noted. A drawback to the ICG is that 
the fluorescent signal is visible through the skin only 47% of the time. If the nodal basin is predictable, 
such as for an extremity melanoma or a breast cancer, we can reasonably proceed with dissection in the 
predicted basin. Truncal melanomas however, do not have predictable drainage and therefore the lack 
of visibility is problematic for using ICG alone.  
 
 
2.2 Study Rationale  
 
There is a need to dev elop reliable alternatives to tech99, and there is room to improve the patient 
experience by eliminating unnecessary injections. Prior studies have established that ICG and 
fluorescence imaging can reliably detect sentinel nodes, but these studies have bee n performed using 
tech99 as well. The goal of this trial is to assess our ability to identify sentinel nodes using only ICG and 
fluorescence imaging. This would be a significant departure from current standard practice, thus we 
have included a safety mecha nism in the study, which is that subjects will still receive the tech99 
injection, but the surgeon is blinded to the result.

6. Cognitive impairment.  
 
3.3 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
 
3.3.1 Criteria for removal from study  
 
Subjects will be removed from the study if they withdraw consent prior to surgery. The study  
itself occurs only in the operating room, with no long term follow -up or involvement of the 
subject.  
Page 5 of 19 (V.08/27/2018 )  
 
3.3.2 Follow -up for withdrawn subjects  
 
Subjects will have sentinel node localization as per routine care if they withdraw from the study.  
 
4.0 Recruitment Method s 
 
4.1 Identification of subjects  
 
Subjects will be identified by the PI and collaborating surgeons in clinic  at HMC, Vasser Brothers Medical 
Center, or Emory University School of Medicine , at the time of their initial consultation.  
 
4.2 Recruitment process  
 
Subjects will be recruited during their initial consultation or any pre -operative visit. During this visit, 
routine care involves counseling the patient about melanoma or breast cancer and scheduling surgery, 
including the sentinel node biopsy. The surgeon  usually doesn’t see the patient again until the day of 
surgery. Subjects will not be recruited on the day of surgery.  
 
4.3 Recruitment materials  
 
None  
 
4.4 Eligibility/screening of subjects  
 
NA 
 
5.0 Consent Process and Documentation  
 
5.1 Consent Process

5.1.1.1  Timing and Location of Consent  
 Consent for the study would be obtained at the end of the clinic visit.  
 
5.1.1.2  Coercion or Undue Influence during Consent  
Subjects will be counseled that enrollment in the study is completely voluntary, 
and will not change their treatment. They will have a sentinel node biopsy 
whether they participate in the study or not, and the sentinel node is the same 
node whether it is localized with ICG or tech99. Subjects will also be counseled 
that they will still receive the tech99, as a backup plan in case the ICG doesn’t 
work. They can think about the study and consent after the visit, although 
enrollment should occur at least 2 days prior to surgery to allow for notification 
of radiology not to mark the nodal basin.  
 
5.1.2 Waiver or alteration of the informed consent requirement  
 
A waiver of consent is requested to review medical record information to determine preliminary 
eligibility to participate in the research.

6.2 Waiver or Alteration of Authorization for the Uses and Disclosures of PHI  
 
6.2.1 Access, use or disclosure of PHI representing no more than a minimal risk to the privacy of the 
individual  
 
6.2.1.1  Plan to protect PHI from improper use or disclosure  
 
Information is included in the Research D ata Plan Form.  
 
6.2.1.2  Plan to destroy identifiers or a justification for retaining identifiers  
 
Study information will be retained until the sponsor notifies the study team that 
the information can be destroyed  and all regulatory and institutional policies are 
met related to data retention.  
 
6.2.2 Explanation for why the research could not practicably be conducted without access to and 
use of PHI  
 
Information must be obtained from the subject’s electronic medical record during recruitment 
to determine eligibility and,  in some cases, to confirm information discussed with the subject in 
regards to their medical histor y. 
 
6.2.3 Explanation for why the research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver or 
alteration of authorization  
 
The waiver is requested only for recruitment to determine subject eligibility to ensure that no 
medical conditions that fall into the exclusion criteria are present and would thus preclude 
enrollment.  This waiver will minimize the enrollment of subjects’ who may ultimately fail to 
meet t he study inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Necessary’ standard (information reasonably necessary to accomplish the objectives of the research) 
per federal regulations.  
 
Access to the information will be limited, to the greatest extent possible, within the research team. All 
disclosures or releases of identifiable information granted under this waiver will be accounted for and 
documented.  
 
7.0 Study Design and Procedures  
 
7.1 Study  Design  
 
Observational pilot study.  
 
From the subject’s viewpoint, the course of events in this study will be no different than usual care and 
sentinel node biopsy.  
 
7.2 Study Procedures  
 
7.2.1 Pre-op Procedure  
 
Subjects will have a dermal injection of technetium99  (tech99) at the melanoma tumor site prior 
to surgery (either the day before, or morning of surgery) or a subareolar injection if breast 
cancer. The surgeon will not look at the lymphoscintigraphy films, and the radiologist should not 
mark the skin.  
 
7.2.2 Opera tive Procedure  
 
 When the subject is in the operating room and appropriately sedated or anesthetized, he or she 
will receive a dermal injectio n of indocyanine green (ICG) 0 .9 ml at the melanoma tumor site or 
subareola if breast cancer. Incision is made in the axilla or groin, and the SPY machine is 
positioned over the lymph node basin. Real -time lymphangiography (SPY) is used to identify 
sentinel nodes. Any fluorescent nodes s hould be resected and are considered sentinel nodes. 
The absolute fluorescence will be quantified for each sentinel node. Absolute fluorescence is 
calculated by the SPY machine.  
 
After the sentinel lymphadenectomy is complete but prior to closing skin, the  excised lymph 
nodes will be examined with the gamma probe (detects tech99 signal) to confirm that they are 
sentinel nodes. If the node does not have a signal with the gamma probe (but is fluorescent) it is 
still considered a sentinel node. The lymph node basin will also be examined with the gamma 
probe, to insure that no sentinel nodes are missed. If a gamma positive sentinel node is 
identified in the lymph node basin, it should be resected and imaged with SPY. If no sentinel 
nodes are able to be identifie d with fluorescent imaging, the gamma probe will be used as per 
usual practice. The surgeon should spend no more than 30 minutes using SPY to identify sentinel 
Page 9 of 19 (V.08/27/2018 ) nodes. If after 30 minutes no sentinel node is found, the gamma probe should be used. The data 
collection form (separately uploaded) should be completed for each case.  
 
7.3 Duration of Participation  
 
Two days (pre -operative and operative procedure visits are associated with the research).  
 
 
7.4 Test Article(s) (Study Drug(s) and/or Study Device(s))  
 
7.4.1 Descript ion 
 
The SPY Elite machine is FDA approved for perfusion imaging. The PI has received permission 
from the FDA under IND number 114602 to perform this research study  using  a dermal injection 
of ICG. The ICG comes as a powder containing 25mg of indocyanine green and sterile water to 
reconstitute the powder for injection. Subjects will receive 2. 25 mg of indocyanine green (ICG) 
in a volume of 0.9 mL.  
 
7.4.2 Treatment Regimen  
 
The patient will receive a  dermal injectio n of indocyanine green (ICG) 0. 9 mL at the melanoma 
tumor sit e or subareola if breast cancer while they are in the operating room under general 
anesthesia. This is a one -time injection so no dose adjustments will be made.  
 
7.4.3 Method for Assigning Subject to Treatment Groups  
 
This is an observational study and not a randomized trial.  
 
7.4.4 Subject Compliance Monitoring  
 
All pertinent procedures and data collection will occur in the operating room. Subject 
compliance monitoring is not applicabl e for this study.   
 
7.4.5 Blinding of the Test Article  
 
There is no blinding involved in this study.  
 
7.4.6 Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return  
 
7.4.6.1  Receipt of Test Article  
 
ICG will be transported from the Investigational Drug Services (IDS) pharmacy to 
the OR  pharmacy the day before surgery  or the morning of the surgery 
depending on when the surgery is schedule d at HMC, Vasser Brother’s Medical 
Center, or Emory University School of Medicine . The ICG will come in a 25mg 
vial with 10 mL of Ampule (Solvent). Subj ects will receive 2.25 mg of 
indocyanine green (ICG) in a volume of 0.9 mL.  
 
7.4.6.2  Storage  
 
The ICG will be stored in the IDS pharmacy  at HMC, Vasser Brother’s Medical 
Center, or Emory University School of Medicine  until the day before surgery  or 
the morning be fore surgery if it is scheduled for the afternoon . A copy of the 
Page 10 of 19 (V.08/27/2018 ) consent form for each patient will be sent to IDS pharmacy at HMC, Vasser 
Brother’s Medical Center, or Emory University School of Medicine prior to 
surgery. ICG should be stored at room tempe rature (between 20 – 25 degree s 
Celsius ).    
 
 
7.4.6.3  Preparation and Dispensing  
 
The ICG will be brought from IDS pharmacy  at HMC, Vasser Brother’s Medical 
Center, or Emory University School of Medicine  to the OR pharmacy the day 
before surgery so it is available  for use  the next day . If the surgery is scheduled 
for the afternoon then IDS pharmacy may bring the ICG over on the morning of 
surgery, not the day before.  The surgeon will prepare the ICG and solvent for 
injection in the operating room prior to the start of the procedure. All aspects of 
the ICG preparation and use will be handled by the surgeon. Once reconstituted 
the ICG can be used for up to six hours, making it possible to use in  several 
different cases in one day  if the doses are drawn up in a sterile environment at 
the same time . 
 
7.4.6.4  Return or Destruction of the Test Article  
 
Any remaining ICG will be discarded in the OR  at HMC, Vasser Brother’s Medical 
Center, or Emory University School of Medicine .  
 
7.4.6.5   Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
 
NA 
 
8.0 Subject  Numbers and Statistical Plan  
 
8.1 Number of Subjects  
 
A total of 40 subjects will be recruited into this study (we estimate we will enroll 20 subjects from Penn  
State Hershey Medical Center  and 20 between Vasser Brother’s Medical Center and Emory University 
School of Medicine. ).  
 
The learning curve for sentinel node biopsy is 5 cases. In order to insure that the data collected 
accurately represents the effectiveness of the SPY machine, each surgeon will have the goal of enroll ing 
at least 8 subjec ts into the study . 
 
8.2 Sample size determination  
 
Sample size of convenience.  This is a feasibility study, and is intended to determine if fluorescence 
lymphangiography can be used alone to localize sentinel nodes in patients with melanoma or breast 
cancer . The sample size of 40 subjects is our estimation of an appropriate number of subjects such that 
we can draw conclusions about this technique for sentinel node biopsy, and allows sufficient numbers 
for multiple surgeons to be involved.   
 
8.3 Statistical met hods  
 
The analysis of these results will be descriptive. We will assess the number of nodes per patient that are 
correctly identified with ICG alone, and the number of patients in whom ICG was successfully used 
Page 11 of 19 (V.08/27/2018 ) alone. Multiple surgeons will be involved, so me with more experience than others with this technique. 
We will assess the learning curve by studying the success rate with ICG over time for each surgeon.  
 
9.0 Confidentiality , Privacy  and Data Management  
 
See the attached Research Data Plan form (HRP -598)  
 
10.0 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
10.1 Periodic evaluation of data  
 
Collaborating surgeons will be monitored for at least 3 subjects, or until they demonstrate proficiency 
with ICG and the SPY device. Proficiency of each surgeon will be assessed by the PI  or a representive 
from Stryker  prior to each surgeon enrolling patients. While obser ving the collaborating surgeons for 
training purposes , the PI or a representative from Stryker will look for competence  in and understanding 
of the use of the SPY machine. Each surgeon should demonstrate an understanding of  the images that 
they are looking at on the SPY machine during the procedure. After 10 subjects, the PI will review the 
cases to insure that sentinel nodes are being identified for each subject.  
 
 
10.2 Data that are  reviewed  
 
Any adverse events that occur during surgery, whether deemed related to the ICG or not, will be 
reviewed. Adverse events will include reactions to ICG such as hives. Efficacy will be determined by 
success rates of localizing sentinel nodes with ICG alone.  
 
10.3 Method of collection of safety information  
 
Safety information will be collected from the collaborating surgeons, through case report forms.  
 
10.4 Frequency of data collection  
 
Safety data collection starts when the patient signs informed consent. Data will be collected on the day 
of surgery, on the standardized data collection form which is separately uploaded. Data should be 
forwarded to the PI within 7 business days of collection. Adverse events should be reported within 7 
business days.  
 
10.5 Individ uals reviewing the data  
 
Data will be reviewed by the PI. Adverse reactions to ICG are extremely rare, and have occurred with 
higher doses of ICG in subjects undergoing retinal angiography. No adverse reactions were seen in the 
prior study with 87 subjects , and none have been reported in the literature concerning sentinel node 
biopsy with ICG.  
 
 
10.6 Frequency of review of cumulative data  
 
Data will be reviewed monthly.  
 
10.7 Statistical tests  
 
The number of subjects planned for this study is relatively small, and gi ven the very low complication 
rate seen in the prior study, statistical analysis will not be meaningful.  
Page 12 of 19 (V.08/27/2018 )  
10.8 Suspension of research  
 
Any grade 4 or 5 adverse event that occurs in a subject will trigger a suspension of research.  
 
 
 
 
11.0 Risks  
 
• Loss of confidentiality  
• Adverse reactions to ICG are extremely rare, and none occurred in the prior trial with 87 subjects.   
• Anaphylactic  reactions , urticarial reactions  and headache  have been reported  rarely  in some patients.  
• The risks of sentinel node biopsy are  usual care  as the subjects will undergo the biopsy regardless of 
their participation in the research .  However, t here is the possible risk of longer surgery, with a 
maximum of 30 additional minutes under anesthesia. This added time is of no consequence to  the 
patient and carries an unmeasurable risk. Inaccurate identification of the sentinel node may occur 
equally in patients both on and off this study, therefore the risk in this study is no greater than usual 
care. The false negative rate in identifying s entinel nodes is 8%. Tech99 is used as a backup in this study 
in the event that the sentinel node cannot be identified with ICG.  
 
 
12.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects and Others  
 
12.1 Potential Benefits to Subjects  
There are no direct benefits to the subjects.  
 
12.2 Potential Benefits to Others  
We may be able to define a group of patients who can have sentinel node localization with ICG and 
fluorescence imaging alone, avoiding the use of tech99. This may reduce costs, and would simplify 
patient care preoperatively.  
 
13.0 Sharing Results with Subjects  
Individual subjects can be told about the success of ICG during their own procedure. General study results will 
not be shared with subjects.  
 
14.0 Subject Stipend (Compensation) and/or Travel Reimbursements  
None  
 
15.0 Economic Burden to  Subjects  
 
15.1 Costs  
 
The sponsor  will provide the ICG directly to HMC, Vasser Brother’s Medical Center, and Emory University 
School of Medicine. Each institution will provide the ICG to the study patients . Subjects will be charged 
for Technetium 99. Subjects  not enrolled in this study would be charged for blue dye, or for ICG if used 
in non -study patients, thus a charge for dye and injection is a usual part of the procedure.  
 
15.2 Compensation for research -related injury

19.0 Adverse Event Reporting  
 
19.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
 
Adverse event  Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of the drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related  
Adverse reaction  Any adverse event caused by a drug  
Suspected adverse 
reaction  Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the adverse event.  Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degr ee 
of certainty about causality than “adverse reaction”.  
• Reasonable possibility.   For the purpose of IND safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  
Serious adverse 
event or Serious 
suspected adverse 
reaction  Serious adverse event or Serious suspected adverse reaction: An adverse event 
or suspected adverse reaction that in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outco mes: Death, a life -threatening 
adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption 
of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/b irth 
defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
Life-threatening 
adverse event or 
life-threatening 
suspected adverse 
reaction  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -
threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator (i.e., the study site 
principal investigator) or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or research 
subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction that had it occu rred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death.  
Page 16 of 19 (V.08/27/2018 ) Unexpected 
adverse event or 
Unexpected 
suspected adverse 
reaction.   An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if 
it is not listed in the investigator brochure, general i nvestigational plan, clinical 
protocol, or elsewhere in the current IND application; or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been previously observed and/or specified.  
 
 
 
For device studies, incorporate the following definitions into the below responses, as written:  
Unanticipated 
adverse device 
effect  Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem 
or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously identifi ed in nature, severity, or degree of incidence 
in the investigational plan or IDE application (including a supplementary plan 
or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a 
device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfar e of subjects.  
 
19.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
 
All adverse events (serious or non -serious) and abnormal test findings observed or reported to study team 
believed to be associated with the study drug(s) or device(s) will be followed until the event (or its sequelae) or 
the abnormal test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator.  
 
An abnormal test finding will be classified as an adverse event if one or more of the following criteria are met:  
• The test finding is accompanied by c linical symptoms  
• The test finding necessitates additional diagnostic evaluation(s) or medical/surgical intervention; including 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy  
NOTE:  Simply repeating a test finding, in the absence of any o f the other listed criteria, does not constitute an 
adverse event.  
• The test finding leads to a change in study drug dosing or discontinuation of subject participation in the clinical 
research study  
The test finding is considered an adverse event by the inv estigator.  
 
19.3 Causality and Severity Assessments  
 
The investigator will promptly review documented adverse events and abnormal test findings to 
determine 1) if the abnormal test finding should be classified as an adverse event; 2) if there is a 
reasonable po ssibility that the adverse event was caused by the study drug(s) or device(s); and 3) if the 
adverse event meets the criteria for a serious adverse event.  
 
If the investigator’s final determination of causality is “unknown and of questionable relationship to the 
study drug(s) or device(s)”, the adverse event will be classified as associated with the use of the study 
drug(s) or device(s) for reporting purposes.  If the investigator’s final determination of causality is 
“unknown but not related to the study d rug(s) or device(s)”, this determination and the rationale for the 
determination will be documented in the respective subject’s case history.  
 
19.4 Reporting of Adverse Reactions and Unanticipated Problems to the FDA   
 
19.4.1  Written IND /IDE  Safety Reports  
The Sponsor -Investigator will submit a written IND Safety Report (i.e., completed FDA Form 
3500A) to the responsible new drug review division of the FDA for any observed or volunteered 
adverse event that is determined to be a serious and unexpected, suspected adverse reaction.  
Each IND Safety Report will be prominently labeled, “IND Safety Report”, and a copy will be 
provided to all participating investigators (if applicable) and sub -investigators.  
 
Page 17 of 19 (V.08/27/2018 ) Written IND Safety Reports will be submitted to the FDA as so on as possible and, in no event, 
later than 15 calendar days following the Sponsor -Investigator’s receipt of the respective 
adverse event information and determination that it meets the respective criteria for reporting.  
 
For each written IND Safety Report , the Sponsor -Investigator will identify all previously 
submitted IND Safety Reports that addressed a similar suspected adverse reaction experience 
and will provide an analysis of the significance of newly reported, suspected adverse reaction in 
light of t he previous, similar report(s) or any other relevant information.  
 
Relevant follow -up information to an IND Safety Report will be submitted to the applicable 
review division of the FDA as soon as the information is available and will be identified as such 
(i.e., “Follow -up IND Safety Report”).  
 
If the results of the Sponsor -Investigator’s follow -up investigation show that an adverse event 
that was initially determined to not require a written IND Safety Report does, in fact, meet the 
requirements for report ing; the Sponsor -Investigator will submit a written IND Safety Report as 
soon as possible, but in no event later than 15 calendar days, after the determination was made.  
 
 
19.4.2  Telephoned IND Safety Reports – Fatal or Life -threatening Suspected Adverse Reactions  
 
In addition to the subsequent submission of a written IND Safety Report (i.e., completed FDA 
Form 3500A), the Sponsor -Investigator will notify the responsible review division of the FDA by 
telephone or facsimile transmission of any unexpected, fatal or lif e-threatening suspected 
adverse reaction.  
 
The telephone or facsimile transmission of applicable IND Safety Reports will be made as soon 
as possible but in no event later than 7 calendar days after the Sponsor -Investigator’s receipt of 
the respective adve rse event information and determination that it meets the respective criteria 
for reporting.  
 
 
19.5 Reporting Adverse Reactions and Unanticipated Problems to the Responsible IRB  
 
In accordance with applicable policies of The Pennsylvania State University Instit utional Review Board 
(IRB), the investigator will report, to the IRB, any observed or reported harm (adverse event) 
experienced by a subject or other individual, which in the opinion of the investigator is determined to be 
(1) unexpected; and (2) probably related to the research procedures. Harms (adverse events) will be 
submitted to the IRB in accordance with the IRB policies and procedures.

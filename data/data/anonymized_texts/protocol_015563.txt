1.0 INTRODUCTION  
This registry is a retrospective, observational, non-controlled chart review conducted to support an 
indication expansion of the Tendril STS 2088 lead to include pacing/sensing in the left bundle branch 
area.  
This clinical investigation will be conducted in accordance with this CIP. All investigators involved in the conduct of the clinical investigation will be qualified by education, training, or experience to perform their 
tasks and this training will be documented appropriately.  
1.1 Background and Rationale 
 Background 
Patients with cardiac disease may exhibit symptoms associated with electrical conduction abnormalities, 
such as bradycardia (sinus node dysfunction and/or heart block), thereby requiring implantation of a permanent dual -chamber (atrioventricular) or single-chamber (ventricular) pacemaker.  However, these 
pacing modalities are associated with alteration of the normal electrical conduction due to right 
ventricular (RV) pacing,
1-3 leading to accelerated progression of left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, 
and increasing the risk of heart failure hospitalization and atrial fibrillation.4, 5 Patients with electrical 
conduction abnormalities may also present with associated ventricular desynchrony causing further 
cardiac disease progression into heart failure with impaired left ventricular function.6 
 
Physiological pacing achieved by His -bundle pacing (HBP) and left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) 
has emerged as an alternative pacing strategy for patients with pacemaker indications. While HBP can 
be considered an ideal form of physiological pacing as it activates the heart through the native His -
Purkinje conduction system resulting in synchronized contraction of the ventricles obviating RV pacing-related complications, its widespread clinical utility has been limited by technical challenges including lead delivery, acc urate His -bundle capture (selective vs. non -selective), and early battery depletion due 
to high pacing thresholds over time. Left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP), on the other hand, has 
been suggested as an effective alternative to overcome the limitatio ns of HBP attributed to the anatomic 
and histological characteristics  of the LBB .
7  
 The left bundle branch (LBB) is surrounded by dense myocardial tissue providing a large target zone for 
pacing owing to its thick, band-like structure.
7 Moreover, the LBB can be activated from the main trunk, 
the posterior fascicle or the septal fascicle.7, 8 Therefore, LBBAP presents a lesser technical challenge 
compared to HBP.  
 
In regard to clinical outcome, it has been reported that LBBAP provides stable and reliable lead 
parameters at short and intermediate follow -up.8-11 The need for a back -up RV lead is deemed 
unnec essary and device programming is simplified.8, 12 Furthermore, reported complication rates of the 
1343 published cases remain low with LBBAP,13 and increased threshold at follow -up is infrequent 
thereby minimizing the need for lead revision.14 Improvements on clinical outcomes of LBBAP compared 
to RVP has been further demonstrated by Sharma et al. using results from the Geisinger -Rush 
Conduction System Pacing Registry with a large multicenter cohort.  It has been concluded that LBBAP was associated with a significant reduction in the composition outcome of all -cause mortality, heart 
failure or upgrade to bi -ventricular pacing.

 Rationale for Conducting this Clinical Investigation 
LBBAP has emerged as a feasible and safe alternative to traditional pacing modalities with clinical and 
electrophysiological advantages. This is a retrospective, observational, non-controlled chart review real-
world evidence registry  to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of LBBA pacing/sensing in patients 
already implanted with the Tendril STS 2088 lead. The LBBAP data collection registry  is designed to 
support future indication expansion of the existing Tendril STS 2088TC lead to include conduction 
system pacing in the left bundle branch area (LBBAP). This LBBAP data collection registry is designed in 
accordance with FDA’s guidance documents : Considerations for the Use of Real -World Data and Real -
World Evidence To Support Regulator y Decision -Making for Drug and Biological Products – December 
2021 and Considerations for the Use of Real -World Evidence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for 
Medical Devices  – August 2017. Tendril STS 2088TC bradycardia lead is currently market approv ed 
under P960013/S46 on May 26, 2009 and CE-marked under CE Cert no. 17 09 01 14607 104 on June 
16, 2009, and is indicated for permanent sensing and pacing in either the right atrium or the right 
ventricle in combination with a compatible pacemaker , implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or 
cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT-P/CRT -D) device.  
2.0 CLINICAL INVESTIGATION OVERVIEW

• Sites should retain an enrollment log which links the subject ID and identifiable information for 
traceability purposes in order to address inquiries from regulatory agencies, as needed.  
• Sites should review patient medical records (i.e., electronic health records) and submit only de-
identified data through Case Report Forms  (CRFs).  
• Sites should make all the effort to collect both successful and unsuccessful LBBAP implantation 
attempts for the time being applicable to the purpose of this registry  by utilizing a device inventory 
list and/or sales data relevant to the usage of the TendrilTM STS 2088 lead. 
• Monitoring by the sponsor will be conducted using a risk -based approach to maintain the 
reliability and data integrity of the data included in this registry  (see details in section 10.6) .  
3.3 Suspension or Early Termination of the Clinical  Investigation  
While no formal statistical rule for early termination of the clinical investigation for insufficient 
effectiveness of the device under investigation is defined, the Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the clinical investigation at any stage or reduce the follow -up period with suitable written notice to the 
investigator. Possible reason(s) may include, but are not limited to: 
• Further product development is cancelled  
• Inability to gather adequate patient data 
 Su bject Follow -up for Early Termination or Suspension of Registry  
If the Sponsor suspends or prematurely terminates the clinical investigation at an individual site in the 
interest of safety, the Sponsor will inform all other Principal Investigators. 
 If suspension or premature termination occurs, the Sponsor will remain responsible for providing resources to fulfill the obligations from the CIP and existing agreements .  
 
The investigator will be requested to return all clinical investigation materials to the Sponsor and provide 
a written statement to the IRB/EC (if applicable). All applicable clinical investigation documents shall be subject to the same retention policy as  detailed in [Section 11.5] of the CIP. 
 A Principal Investigator, IRB/EC, or regulatory authority may also suspend or prematurely terminate participation in the clinical investigation at the investigational site(s) for which they are responsible. The 
investigators will follow the requirements specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement.  
 If a suspended investigation is to be resumed, a prior approval should be obtained from the EC/IRB (if 
applicable) and a notification should be sent to the regulatory bodies  (if applicable) . 
4.0 ENDPOINTS  
4.1 Primary Safety Endpoint and Rationale 
The primary safety endpoint evaluates freedom from LBBAP lead related serious adverse device effects 
(SADEs) through 6 months post-implant attempt.

minimal risk to patients. Safeguards include design of the registry  to use only de- identified data and 
reporting pooled results with no direct identification of any individual patient or study center.  
 
It would be impracticable to require individual informed consent from each patient. A requirement of informed consent could introduce sampling bias into the findings of the registry  since the subset of patients 
who would respond to a solicitation for a chart review and who would provide consent might not be 
representative of the population.  
 
For sites where the governing IRB/EC has not granted a waiver of informed consent, subject will be  either 
informed of the nature of the data collection project by means  of the privacy notice, or will be asked to 
provide a signed written informed consent, as approved by the IRB/EC. The inves tigators will be 
responsible to follow the recom mended privacy notice or consent rules before starting data collection within 
this regi stry.

7.1 Definition  
 Adverse Event  
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward 
clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, in the context 
of a clinical investigation, whether or not related to the investigational medical device.  
 
As part of ISO14155 Section 3.2, the Adverse Event definition has the following notes: 
 Note 1:  This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device or the comparator. 
Note 2:  This definition includes events related to the procedures involved. 
Note 3:  For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to t he use of 
investigational medical devices  or comparator s. 
 Serious Adverse Event  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an AE that led to any of the following:   
 
a) death, 
b) serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that resulted in any of the following:  
1. life-threatening illness or injury,  
2. permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function,  
3. hospitalization or prolongation of patient hospitalization,  
4. medical or surgical intervention to prevent life threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function. 
5. chronic disease  
c) fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital physical or mental impairment or birth defect. 
 Note:  A planned hospitalization for a pre-existing condition, or a procedure required by the CIP without a 
serious deterioration in health, is not considered a SAE. 
7.2 Device Relationship 
Determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility that an investigational product or device under 
investigation caused or contributed to an AE is to be determined by the Investigator  and recorded on 
the appropriate CRF form. Determination should be based on the assessment of temporal relationships, 
evidence of alternative etiology, medical/biologic plausibility and patient condition (pre -existing condition).

Sites will collect information on all procedure and device-related adverse events, whether serious or not, and all death events and report to the Sponsor on an Adverse Event CRF. Sites should update the 
Adverse Event CRF with additional information regarding the event as the information becomes available.  
 
Unchanged, chronic, non-worsening or pre-existing conditions are not AEs and should not be reported.  
 Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
The investigator must report all procedure and device-related SAEs  to the Sponsor as soon as 
possible.  
 Sites must record the date the site staff became aware that the event met the criteria of a reportable 
event as per this protocol  in the source document. The Investigator will further report the applicable 
events  to the local IRB/EC according to the institution’s IRB/EC reporting requirements (if applicable). 
 Adverse Event Reporting to Country Regulatory Authorities by the Sponsor  
The Sponsor will report the procedure or device-related SAEs to the country regulatory authority per local 
requirements.  
8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
The following section describes the statistical methods for the clinical investigation. Additional details on 
statistical analyses, including justification of clinical investigation design, sensitivity analyses, poolability analyses, subgroup analyses and analysis of descriptive endpoints, will be maintained in a separate 
Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP). 
8.1 Analysis Populations 
 Enrolled Population 
This analysis population will include enrolled subjects who have been attempted to implant for the 
TendrilTM STS 2088 lead in the LBBA.

10.2 Site Principal  Investigator Responsibilities 
The role of the Site Principal Investigator is to implement, oversee the management of the day -to-day 
conduct of the clinical investigation as well as ensure data integrity and the rights, safety and well -being 
of the subjects involved in the clinical investigation. The principal investigator shall support monitoring 
and reporting to IRB/EC and local competent authorities as necessary, throughout the conduct of the 
clinical investigation.  
 
The principal investigator is responsible for ensuring adequate training and qualification of the investigation site team and for maintaining oversight of their activities. The principal investigator may  
delegate tasks to members of the investigation site team but retains responsibility for the clinical 
investigation. This also applies when activities are outsourced to an external  organi zation by the principal 
investigator in which case he/she shall exercise oversight to ensure the integrity of all tasks performed 
and any data generated by this external organization. 
10.3 Clinical Investigation Finances and Agreements 
Abbott will finance the clinical investigation and will compensate investigational sites for participation in 
the clinical investigation per the conditions of agreement between Abbott and the i nvestigational site.  
10.4 CIP Amendments  
The Sponsor will provide approved CIP amendments to the Investigators  prior to implementing the 
amendment. The Principal Investigator is responsible for notifying the IRB/EC or equivalent committee of 
the CIP amendment (administrative changes) or obtaining IRB’s/EC’s approval of the CIP  amendment 
(changes in subject care or safety), according to the instructions provided by the Sponsor with the CIP 
amendment.   
 Sites must document in writing acknowledgement/approval of the CIP amendment by the IRB/EC prior to 
implementation of the CIP  amendment. Sites must also provide copies of this documentation to the 
Sponsor. 
10.5 Training  
 Site Training 
All Investigators  and clinical investigation personnel are required to attend Sponsor training sessions, 
which may be conducted at an Investigator's meeting, a site initiation visit , or other appropriate training 
sessions. Over -the-phone or self-training may take place as required. Training of Inves tigators  and 
clinical investigation personnel will include, but is not limited to, the CIP  requirements, electronic case 
report form completion, and clinical investigation  personnel responsibilities. All Investigators  and clinical 
investigation  personnel that are trained must sign a training log (or an equivalent) upon completion of the 
training. Prior to signing the training log, Investigators and clinical investigation personnel must not 
perform any CIP -related activities that are not considered standard of care at the site.

specific  monitoring plan which will include the planned extent of source data verification.  
 
Prior to initiating any procedure, the Sponsor monitor (or delegate) will ensure that the following criteria are met:  
 
• The investigator understands and accepts the obligation to conduct the clinical investigation  
according to the CIP  and applicable regulations and has signed the Investigator Agreement or the 
Clinical Trial Agreement.   
• The Investigator and his/her staff should have sufficient time and facilities to conduct the clinical 
investigation  and should have access to an adequate number of appropriate subjects to conduct 
the clinical investigation .  
• Sites must have source documentation (including original medical records) to substantiate proper 
informed consent procedures  (if required), adherence to CIP  procedures, adequate reporting and 
follow -up of adverse events, accuracy of data collected on case report forms, and device 
information.  
• The Investigator/site will permit access to such records  and will maintain a monitoring visit sign-in 
log at the site. The Investigator will agree to dedicate an adequate amount of time to the monitoring process. The Investigator and/or research coordinator will be available for monitoring 
visits. It is expected that the Investigator will provide the monitor with a suitable working 
environment for review of clinical investigation-related documents. 
10.7 Deviations from CIP  
The Investigator should not deviate from the CIP  for any reason  
 The Sponsor will not grant any waivers for CIP deviations.  Sites must report all deviations to the 
Sponsor  using the Deviation CRF. The Sponsor will monitor the occurrence of CIP  for evaluation of 
investigator compliance to the CIP and regulatory requirements and handle according to written 
procedures. Investigators will determine the cause of deviations , implement corrective actions  and inform 
their IRB/EC or equivalent committee of CIP  deviations in accordance with their specific IRB/EC or 
equivalent committee reporting policies and procedures.  
 
In the event of repeated non-compliance, as determined by the Sponsor, a Sponsor’s monitor or company representative will attempt to secure compliance by one or more of the following (and not limited to):  
• Visiting the investigator and/or delegate 
• Telephoning the investigator and/or delegate  
• Corresponding with the investigator and/or delegate 
 Repeated non-compliance with the signed agreement, the CIP , or any other conditions of the clinical

APPENDIX VII : CIP SUMMARY 
Clinical 
Investigation 
Name and 
Number  LBBAP  Data Collection Registry  
Title Left Bundle Branch Area Pacing (LBBAP) Data Collection Registry  
Objective (s) The LBBAP data collection registry will be conducted to support an indication 
expansion of the TendrilTM STS 2088 lead to include pacing/sensing in the left 
bundle branch area.    
Device  Under 
Investigation  TendrilTM STS 2088 lead  
Number of 
Subjects Required for Inclusion in 
Clinical 
Investigation  Data on a minimum of 220 attempted subjects will be included in order to have 
190 evaluable subjects in this registry . The chart review will be conducted at up 
to 20 centers worldwide. 
Clinical 
Investigation Design Retrospective, observational, non-randomized, multi -center registry  
 
• This registry  will retrospectively collect data on LBBAP implants already 
attempted in patients using the Tendril STS 2088 lead.  
• Sites should make every effort to enroll consecutive subjects with an attempted LBBAP implant  
• Sites will retain an enrollment log which links the subject ID and identifiable information for traceability purposes in order to address 
inquiries from regulatory agencies, as needed.  
• Sites will review patient medical records (i.e., electronic health records) 
and submit only de-identified data through Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
• Sites should make all the effort to collect both successful and unsuccessful LBBAP implantation attempts for the time being applicable to the purpose of this re gistry  by utilizing a device inventory list and/or 
sales data relevant to the usage of the Tendril
TM STS 2088 lead. 
• Data will be collected from previously occurring visits at baseline (required) , implant (required) , 6 months  (± 3 months, required), and 12 
months  (-2, +4 months, optional ). 
• Monitoring by the sponsor will be conducted using a risk -based 
approach to maintain the reliability and data integrity of the data 
included in this registry . 
Waiver of 
Informed Consent Waiver of patient informed consent will be requested at each site’ s governing 
IRB/EC since this registry  involves no more than minimal risk and a requirement 
of individual informed consent would make the conduct of the research 
impracticable1  

  
Study Name: LBBAP Data Collection Registry

Template: 86357 Rev. J   Page 37 of 39  
 
• No more than minimal risk:  The only risk to patients are related to the 
safeguarding of patient information. The registry  design mitigates this 
risk by including controls to ensure there is minimal risk to patients by 
collecting only de-identified data and reporting pooled results with no direct identification of any individual patient or study center.  
 
• Impracticable to require individual informed consent:  A requirement of informed consent could introduce sampling bias into the findings since 
the subset of patients who respond to the solicitation for this registry  and 
who provide informed consent may not be representative of the registry  
population

human subjects. Bull Med Ethics. 2002(182):17 -23. 
Primary 
Endpoints The primary safety endpoint evaluates freedom from LBBAP lead related serious 
adverse device effects (SADEs) through 6 months  post-implant attempt. 
 
The primary effectiveness endpoint evaluates  the composite success rate of 
acceptable capture thresholds and sense amplitudes for LBBAP at 6 months 
after successful implant ation . 
Subject Follow -up • Follow -up office visits as noted in subject’s medical records at the following 
scheduled interval:  
Implant (required) , 6 months (± 3 months , required), and 12 months ( -2, +4  
months, optional ) post-implant attempt   
• Any visits that occur between this visit schedule will be collected and reported 
as unscheduled visits.  
Inclusion Criteria  1) Subject has a de  novo attempted implant of the TendrilTM STS 2088 lead in 
the Left Bundle Branch Area on or before January 31 2023 and Subject’s 
medical records contain data through at least 6 months (± 3 months ) after 
LBBAP implant attempt 
2) Subject is ≥ 18 years of age or the legal age, whichever age is greater  
3) For sites where the governing IRB/EC has not granted a waiver of informed 
consent, subject has either been informed of the nature of the clinical investigation using a privacy notice or has provided a signed written 
informed consent, as approved by the IRB/EC (Note: This inclusion criterion 
is not applicable for sites where the governing IRB/EC or applicable 
regulation has granted a waiver of patient consent)  
Exclusion Criteria  1) Subject was enrolled in another clinical trial during this data collection 
period that might impact the outcomes of the present registry

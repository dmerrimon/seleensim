Study Design  
This is a multicenter, open -label extension study to evaluate the long-term safety and clinical activity 
of ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP who completed study ALN -AS1-001. 
The last assessments performed, determining previous study (ALN -AS1-001) completion, will serve as 
the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If  more than 60 days have elapsed since the last 
assessment, safety assessments will be repeated before administration of ALN -AS1.  It is anticipated 
that patients will begin ALN -AS1 administration in this study within 6 months after the last dose of 
study d rug in the previous study.  Eligibility will be confirmed before administration of the first dose of 
ALN -AS1 (Day 1).  Patients will undergo assessments at the clinical study center every month for the 
first 3 months.  Then, through Month 6, and according to the dosing regimen selected, assessments will 
take place at the clinical study center or via a phone contact (for an every month dosing regimen, visits 
will be every month; for an every 3 months dosing regimen, visits will be every 3 months).  After a 
patient has completed 12 months of ALN -AS1 administration in this study (6 months in an every 
month dosing regimen), and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, 
study procedures, including ALN -AS1 administration, may take pl ace at the patient’s home by a 
healthcare professional.  If the patient is unable to come to the study site, and a visit by a home 
healthcare professional is not possible due to circumstances related to the COVID -19 pandemic, ALN -
AS1 may be administered by  the patient or the caregiver under the oversight of the Investigator, and 
following consultation with the medical monitor, as allowed by applicable country and local 
regulations.  Study procedures may occur at the patient’s home at the discretion of the I nvestigator, 
based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical 
study center every 3 months for the first year, and thereafter every 6 months through the end of the 
treatment period.  Additional vi sits to collect clinical laboratory samples may occur at home at any 
point during the treatment period, within 14 days prior to scheduled dose administration.  Patients will 
return to the clinical study center for a posttreatment follow -up visit after admi nistration of the last 
dose of ALN -AS1.  An ALA/PBG Monitoring/EOS visit will be conducted either at the clinical study 
center or via phone contact, unless treatment continues with ALN -AS1.  
Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acu te porphyria attacks, pain assessments, 
and narcotic use.  Patients will also be provided with laboratory sample collection kits and instructions 
for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center.  
Patients may receive ALN -AS1 as long as  they do not fulfill any of the study discontinuation criteria or 
until ALN -AS1 is commercially available in the patient’s territory or the ALN -AS1 development 
program is discontinued (whichever comes first).  
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review safety and tolerability data collected during the study 
with the primary purpose of protecting the safety of patients participating in the study.  
Number of Planned Patients  
Up to 24 patients are planned for enrollment in this study (including optional coh orts in 
ALN -AS1-001). 
Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria  
Patients with AIP, who have completed Part C of study ALN -AS1-001, will be eligible for screening in 
this study.  Eligible patients will not be on a scheduled regimen of hemin to prevent porphyr ia attacks 
at Screening.  Patients with alanine transaminase ≥2.0× upper limit of normal, total bilirubin ≥2 mg/dL 
(unless bilirubin elevation is due to Gilbert’s syndrome), or estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤30 
mL/min/1.73 m2 (using the Modification  of Diet in Renal Disease formula) at Screening are not 
eligible for this study.

  Investigational Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
ALN -AS1 Solution for Injection (subcutaneous use [SC]) is comprised of a synthetic, small interfering 
RNA targeting ALAS1 and bearing a triantennary N -acetyl galactosamine ligand conjugated to the 
sense strand, formulated in phosphate buffer.  
The study starting dose and regimen of ALN -AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg as an SC injection administered every 
3 months.  Based on emerging cl inical data, the SRC may approve changes to the dosing regimen, 
including decreases in the dose level and changes in the dosing frequency.  However any dose and 
dosing regimen will not exceed a previously explored dose level or frequency that was determine d to 
be safe and well -tolerated in study ALN -AS1-001, SRC, Health Authority and Ethics Committee 
approval must be sought prior to dose escalation above 5.0 mg/kg in accordance with local Regulatory 
requirements.  
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Not applicable  
Duration of Treatment and Study  
The duration of treatment is up to 48 months.  The estimated total time on study, inclusive of 
Screening/Baseline, for each patient is up to 56 months.  
Statistical Methods  
Statistical analyses  will be primarily descriptive.  Incidence of AEs will be summarized by maximum 
severity and relationship to ALN -AS1.  Incidence of and serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs 
leading to discontinuation will also be tabulated.  By -patient listings will be pr ovided for deaths, SAEs, 
and events leading to discontinuation.  
Laboratory shift tables from baseline to worst values will be presented.  Abnormal physical 
examination findings and electrocardiogram data will be presented in by -patient listings.  Descript ive 
statistics will be provided for electrocardiogram interval data and presented as both actual values and 
changes from baseline relative to each on study evaluation and to the last evaluation on -study.  
Clinical activity of ALN -AS1 will be summarized prim arily by descriptive statistics.  The clinical 
activity of ALN -AS1 will be evaluated by the frequency and characteristics of porphyria attacks 
including duration, treatment, and severity of porphyria attacks and number and duration of visits to a 
health ca re setting for acute porphyria care.  Patient diary recordings, including BPI -SF questionnaire 
scores, will also be summarized.   
PD analysis will include the evaluation of change in ALA, PBG, and ALAS mRNA levels.  Descriptive 
statistics (eg, mean and sta ndard error of the mean) for observed levels of PD parameters and the 
relative change from baseline will be presented for each of the postdose follow -up time points.  
The PK concentration of ALN -AS1 will be determined.  Antidrug antibody results will be tab ulated 
overall and by previous treatment in the previous study (ALN -AS1-001).  A by -patient listing will also 
be provided.  
Additional exploratory analyses may be conducted on analytes related to targeting the heme 
biosynthesis pathway.  Quality of life sco res will also be summarized.

Notes:   
• White boxes represent visits to the clinical study center or when patients will be contacted by phone; grey boxes represent s tudy visit that may be 
conducted while the patient is at home.  
• When scheduled at the same time points, assessments of vital signs and 12 -lead ECGs should be performed first, before the physical examinations 
and blood/urine sample collections.  
a Patients are not required to complete Screening/Baseline assessments if the assessments in the previous study (ALN -AS1-001) were completed within 60 days 
of administration of the first dose of ALN -AS1 in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed since the last assessment, clinica l laboratory tests and ECGs 
will be repeated before administration of ALN -AS1.  Results should be available and deemed acceptable before the administration of the first dose of ALN -
AS1.  On Day 1, results from hematology, chemistry (including LFTs), and co agulation tests collected within the prior 14 days must be reviewed by the 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 8, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  9 
  Investigator before study drug administration.  If results from within the prior 14 days are not available at a dosing visit,  locally analyzed predose assessments 
may be used for re view in order to allow same day study drug administration and additional samples for central analysis must also be collected.  
b After a patient has completed 12 months of ALN -AS1 administration in this study, and where applicable country and local regulati ons and infrastructure allow, 
study procedures, including ALN -AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional.  Study procedures may occur at the 
patient’s home at the discretion of the Investigator, based on safety an d tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical 
study center Q6M.  Additional visits to collect c linical laboratory samples may occur at home at any point during the treatment period, within 14 days prior to 
scheduled dose administration.  
c See Section 7.1 for details on the interval medical history/disease history to be recorded at Screening/Baseline.  Ongoing AE s from the previous study 
(ALN -AS1-001) will be captured as medical history.  
d A complete physical exa mination will be performed at Screening/Baseline, and D1.  At all other visits, a targeted physical examination will be perfo rmed.  On 
dosing days, the physical examination will be performed predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, the physical examination can occur at any time 
during the visit.  See Section  7.5.3  for details on the physical examination.  
e Height will be measured at Screeni ng/Baseline only.  
f Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate.  On D1, vital signs will be collected  within 1 hour predose; and 2 hours 
(±10 minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, vital signs will be coll ected within 1 hour predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, vital signs 
can be collected at any time during the visit.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be cons istent for each patient), after the 
patient has  rested comfortably for at least 10 minutes.  
g Using central ECG equipment, triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine position after the patient has rested comfortably for at least 5 
minutes.  For patients receiving ≤2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1, ECGs will be performed within 1 hour predose and 2 hours (±15 minutes) postdose at a minimum of 2 
of the following visits:  D1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 15 (only if visit is done at clinic), or Month 18.  In patients receiving >2 .5 mg/kg 
ALN -AS1, ECGs will be performed within 1 hour predose and 4 hours (±20 minutes) postdose at a minimum of two of the following vis its:  D1, Month 3, 
Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 15 (only if visit is done at clinic), or Month 18.  On all other dosing days, ECGs will be collected within 1 hour predose 
(see Section  7.5.4  for ECG assessment details).   
h Clinical laboratory parameters are des cribed in Section  7.5.5 .  On dosing days, blood samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected predose.  On 
days when ALN -AS1 is not a dministered, blood samples can be collected at any time during the visit. On dosing days, results from hematology, chemistry 
(including LFTs), and coagulation tests collected within the prior 14 days must be reviewed by the Investigator before study drug a dministration.  If results 
from within the prior 14 days are not available at a dosing visit, locally analyzed predose assessments may be used for revie w in order to allow same day study 
drug administration  and additional samples for central analysis  must   also be collected.  
i A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening/Baseline; thereafter, urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  Results  must be available before dosing.  
j ALN -AS1 will be administered by SC injection according to the Pharmacy M anual.  See Section  6.2.2  for ALN -AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  For 
weight -based dosing, weight measured at the current study center visit (dosing da y) will be used to calculate the dose of ALN -AS1 through M12.  After M12, 
weight measured at either the previous study center visit or the current study center visit may be used to calculate the weig ht-based dose of ALN -AS1.  
k Spot urine samples will be co llected for measurement of ALA, PBG, and creatinine levels.  On dosing days, samples should be collected predose.  
l On dosing days, blood and urine samples for ALAS1 mRNA (and possible biomarker) analysis will be collected within 1 hour pred ose. 
m Blood sa mples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points listed in Table  4 (Appendix Section  11.1).  Blood sample collection for PK analysis at 
Month 9 and Month 15 is only necessary if ECG will be performed at same visit.  
n On dosing days, blood samples for antidrug antibody analysis sho uld be collected within 1 hour predose.  
o Porphyria attack laboratory sample collection kits should be dispensed at the screening visit along with instructions for use . For any attack that occurs through 
M37, urine samples should be collected within 24 hou rs of the start of clinical intervention (eg, hemin or glucose administration) and within 24 hours of the end 
of clinical intervention.  If patients are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laborator y sample collection k its will be provided

Amendment 8, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  10 
  that contain instructions for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center, if possible.  These urine sa mples may also be analyzed for 
exploratory biomarkers.  
p In addition to the time points indicated, the EQ -5D-5L questionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a porphyria attack 
(but not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible.  
q Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, p ain assessments, and narcotic use on a daily basis through M9; 
thereafter, acute porphyria attacks will be recorded in the diary.  The BPI will be completed on a weekly basis as part of th e patient diary through M9, then 
Q3M.  
r Patients will be contacted b y phone to collect AEs and concomitant medications.  Patients will also be reminded to collect and send urine samples to the clinical 
study center, if possible, if they are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack.  
s Medications that are ongoing from the previous study (ALN -AS1-001), started between the previous study and this study, and started after signing informed 
consent in this study, will be captured as concomitant medication(s).

g Urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  Results must be available before dosing.  
h ALN -AS1 will be administered by SC injection according to the Pharmacy Manual.  See Section  6.2.2  for ALN -AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  Weight 
measured at either the previous study center visit or the current study center visit may be used to calculate the we ight-based dose of ALN -AS1.  
i Spot urine samples will be collected for measurement of ALA, PBG, and creatinine levels.  On dosing days, samples should be c ollected predose.  
j On dosing days, blood and urine samples for ALAS1 mRNA (and possible biomarker) a nalysis will be collected within 1 hour predose.  
k Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points listed in Table  4 (Appendix Secti on 11.1). 
l On dosing days, blood samples for antidrug antibody analysis should be collected within 1 hour predose.  
m In addition to the time points indicated, the EQ -5D-5L questionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a porphyria attack 
(but, not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible.  
n Patients or caregivers will be prov ided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks.  The BPI will be completed as part of the patient diary Q3M.  
o Patients will be contacted by phone to collect AEs and concomitant medications.  Patients will also be reminded to collect an d send urine sa mples to the clinical 
study center, if possible, if they are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack.

  1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Disease Overview  
The porphyrias are a family of rare metabolic disorders predominately caused by a genetic 
mutation in 1 of the 8 enzymes responsible for heme synthesis. (1)  The 2 major categories are 
erythropoietic and hepatic, depending on the major site of expression of the underlying enzyme 
deficiency .(2)  In addition, the porphyrias are classified as acute if patients present with 
neurovisceral symptoms (eg, abdominal pain and neurologic symptoms) or cutaneous if they 
present with dermal blistering or photosensitivity. (3, 4) 
This study will include patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), the most common acute 
hepatic porphyria (AHP).  AIP occurs as a result of an autosomal dominant mutation leading to 
partial deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminas e (PBGD), the third enzyme in the heme 
biosynthesis pathway .(5)  The rate limiting step in heme synthesis is the upstre am enzyme 
5-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1), which is controlled by feedback repression via the 
end-product heme.  In response to a decrease in endogenous heme in the liver, as can occur with 
fasting, hormonal alterations, or with cytochrome P450 (C YP) inducing drugs, ALAS1 is 
induced, resulting in increased flux through the heme synthesis pathway.  In patients with AIP, 
this can result in the marked accumulation of the toxic heme intermediates porphobilinogen 
(PBG) and delta aminolevulinic acid (ALA ) in the blood and urine due to the deficiency in the 
downstream PBGD.  Clinically, this manifests as acute attacks characterized by severe 
abdominal pain, cardiovascular as well as neurologic and psychiatric dysfunction. (6) 
1.1.1.  Epidemiology  
Over 370 mutations have been identified in the PBGD gene, which in most instances result in its 
reduction by approximately 50%.  The exact prevalence of AIP is unknown due to under 
diagnosis, variation by geographic region, and the differences in penetrance observed for the 
different mutations .(2)  However, it is estimated that the prevalence of AIP is 5 to 10 per 100,000 
peopl e in Western countries, while in Sweden it occurs in 1 in 1,000 people due to a founder 
effect associated with the resultant G593A mutation .(7-10)  AIP shows incomp lete penetrance 
and on average only 10% to 50% of carriers with a mutation present with clinical symptoms. (11)  
It has been proposed that unknown inherited co -factors, in addition to PBGD mutations, may 
explain why a small percentag e of patients present with much more severe disease while the 
majority remain asymptomatic.  
Patients with AIP present with acute attacks characterized by neurovisceral symptoms and signs 
including severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or l ess commonly diarrhea, 
hypertension, tachycardia, fever, muscle weakness, as well as neurological (eg, neuropathy, 
seizures) and psychiatric (eg, anxiety and confusion) manifestations .(12)  AIP attacks typically 
start after puberty and can be triggered by exogenous factors such as medications (especially 
barbiturates, sulfonamides, and hydantoins), stress, exogenous hormones, nutritional status, and 
infection.  Clinically active disease is more common in women, where attacks often occur around 
the menstrual cycle and are likely precipitated by hormonal changes.  
Many AIP patients remain undiagnosed given that the disease is rare and characterized by 
non-specific symptoms (eg, abdominal pain a nd nausea). (2)  The initial diagnosis involves 
demonstrating elevated urinary PBG (typically 20 -50 × normal reference range) and ALA 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 8, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  25 
  (typically 5 -20 × normal reference range) when the pati ent is having acute attack symptoms.  
Once a test is positive for elevated ALA and PBG and porphyria is suspected, genetic testing for 
a PBGD mutation is performed.   
There are 4 main clinical phenotypes of AIP.  Latent gene carriers have never had an acut e attack 
and are biochemically inactive (normal urinary ALA and PBG).  Asymptomatic high excreters 
(ASHE) do not have current acute attacks, but are biochemically active (increased urinary ALA 
and PBG).  The increased levels of ALA and PBG in ASHE patients  are lower than those in AIP 
patients during an acute attack, but are still significantly higher than normal reference values. (6-
8)  Sporadic attack patients have infrequent acute attacks.  Recurrent attack patients have ≥4 
attacks per year requiring hospitalization or treatment by a  medical professional. (7) 
1.1.2.  Current Management and Unmet Medical Need  
Management of acute attacks often requires hospitalization.  Patients are initially treated with 
supportive care and carbohydrate loading, analgesics and anti -emetics, and removal of known 
precipitating factors. (13)  In patients with moderate to severe attacks, or who fail to respond to 
support ive measures, treatment with intravenous (IV) hemin (daily for 3 -5 days) is commenced.  
Symptoms typically begin to improve after 2 to 5 days of hemin treatment, accompanied by a 
lowering of urinary ALA and PBG levels to below or at the upper limit of norm al (ULN) 
reference value; however, in some patients attacks can last several weeks, requiring prolonged 
hemin use and hospitalization. (14)  With prolonged and severe attacks, cranial nerve 
involvement can occur, leading to bulbar paralysis, respiratory failure, and de ath.(15) 
Hemin, a blood derived therapy, was appr oved as Normosang® (heme arginate) in the European 
Union (EU) and as Panhematin® (lyophilised hematin) in the United States (US) in 1999 and 
1983, respectively. (16, 17)  In the EU, heme arginate is indicated for the treatment of acute 
attacks of hepatic porphyria (eg, AIP, variegate porphyria, and hereditary coproporphyria); 
whereas, in the US lyophilized hem in is limited to the amelioration of recurrent attacks of AIP 
temporally related to the menstrual cycle.  Approval of both products was based on biochemical 
efficacy (ie, lowering of ALA and PBG) as well as data from uncontrolled case series and case 
repor ts.(18-22)  Hemin side effects include thrombophle bitis, transient anticoagulation, and in 
rare cases, anaphylaxis or renal failure .(22-24)  In addition, hemin administration requir es a large 
vein for administration, often necessitating central venous access.  
While the majority of patients who experience attacks have them sporadically, it is estimated that 
up to 1,000 AIP patients experience recurrent attacks (typically defined as ≥4  per year) in the US 
and EU combined .(25)  While hemin is currently only approved to ameliorate acute attacks, it is 
administered prophylactically in some patients with recurrent attacks (eg, administered every 1 -2 
weeks). (26)  Potent ial problems associated with chronic hemin administration include infusion 
site phlebitis, iron overload, and the need for chronic IV access and associated complications (eg, 
risk of infection or occlusion). (5)  In addition, there have been reports of a decrease in efficacy 
with chronic hemin administration, as evidenced by the need to increase the frequency or dosage 
of hemin prophylaxis over time in attempt to maintain a clinical effect. (27)  In patients with very 
severe recurrent attacks, or  in whom hemin treatment is not effective, liver transplantation can be 
curative; however, organ transplantation is a high -risk procedure and is rarely used as a treatment 
option .  Given the significant morbidity and mortality, there remains a significant unmet need for 
an efficacious, simple, fast -acting and better tolerated treatment for acute or prevent recurrent

  attacks in patients with AIP.  
1.2. RNA Interference  
RNA interference (RNAi) is a naturally occurring cellular mechanism mediated by small 
interferin g RNAs (siRNAs) for regulating gene expression.  Typically, synthetic siRNAs are 19 
to 25 base pair double stranded oligonucleotides in a staggered duplex with a 2 -nucleotide 
overhang at both or 1 of the 3’ ends .(28)  Such siRNAs can be designed to target an endogenous 
messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript of a given gene.  When introduced into cells, the net effect 
of an RNAi -based pharmacological approach is the binding of the siRNA to its complementary 
mRNA sequence, cleavage of this target mRNA, and reduction of synthesis of the target protein, 
resulting in a decrease of the target protein levels. (29)  The ability to selectively and potently 
degrade the mRNA encoding the ALAS1 protein (thereby decreasing accumulation of the toxic 
intermediates ALA and PBG) using an siRNA is a novel approach for the prevention and 
treatment of acute attacks in patients with AIP.   
1.3. ALN -AS1 
ALN -AS1 (givosiran) comprises a synthetic siRNA covalently  linked to a GalNAc containing 
ligand (ALN60519), specific for ALAS1 and formulated for administration via subcutaneous 
(SC) injection. ALN -60519 has a target region between nucleotide 918 to 937 of the ALAS1 
mRNA. Attachment to a triantennary GalNAc ligan d to the siRNA enables its distribution to the 
liver (which is the primary site of ALAS1 synthesis), followed by intracellular delivery to 
hepatocytes via ASGPR, resulting in engagement of the RNAi pathway and suppression of 
hepatic ALAS1 protein synthesis . 
ALN -AS1 is currently in development for treatment of acute attacks in patients with AIP, the 
most common AHP.  
Further information on ALN -AS1, including the clinical and nonclinical experience to date, is 
available in in the current version of the Investi gator’s Brochure (IB).  
1.4. Study Design Rationale  
This is a multicenter, open -label extension study designed to evaluate the long -term safety and 
clinical activity of subcutaneously administered ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP who have 
completed clinical study ALN -AS1-001.  The primary endpoint for the study is the incidence of 
AEs.  
1.5. Dose Rationale  
Clinical data from Part A and Part B of the ongoing study ALN -AS1-001 demonstrate that single 
(0.035 -2.5 mg/kg) and multiple (0.35 -1.0 mg/kg) doses of ALN -AS1 have bee n generally 
well-tolerated in patients with AIP who are ASHE.  Additionally, data from this study indicate 
that a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1 results in near normalization of urine ALA and PBG 
levels, which is sustained for approximately 14 weeks.   
Patients in Part C of the ongoing study ALN -AS1-001 who are eligible for participation in this 
study will likely require a higher dose of ALN -AS1 to normalize ALA and PBG as they have 
higher levels of ALAS1 upregulation and higher baseline levels of ALA and  PBG, when 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 8, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  27 
  compared to patients with AIP who are ASHE. (30)  For example, based on preliminary data in 
Part A and Part B of the ALN -AS1-001 study, the mean PBG level of patients who are ASHE is 
21.9 mmol/mol Cr (N=28); whereas, in Part C of this study in patients with AHP who have 
recur rent porphyria attacks, the mean PBG level is approximately 49.3 mmol/mol Cr (N=12).  
The study starting dose and regimen of ALN -AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg as an SC injection administered 
every 3 months.  Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may approve changes t o the ALN -
AS1 dosing regimen, including decreases in the dose level and changes in dosing frequency.  
However, any dosing regimen will not exceed a previously explored dose level or frequency that 
was determined to be safe and well -tolerated in study ALN -AS1-001. SRC, Health Authority and 
Ethics Committee approval must be sought prior to dose level escalation above 5.0 mg/kg in 
accordance with local Regulatory requirements.  
The study starting dose and regimen was selected based on the benefit:risk profile o f ALN -AS1 
in Part C of the ongoing ALN -AS1-001 study.  Preliminary data to date indicate that 
administration of 5.0 mg/kg ALN -AS1 has been generally well -tolerated.  There have been no 
study drug -related serious adverse events ( SAEs ), severe AEs, or clinic ally significant changes in 
safety parameters.  While a single 2.5 mg/kg dose of ALN -AS1 has also been generally well -
tolerated when administered to patients in Part A and Part C of study ALN -AS1-001, this dose 
has not resulted in near normalization of ALA  and PBG levels.  In addition, while emerging data 
from Part C indicate that an every 3 months dose of 2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1 demonstrated some 
clinical activity (eg, decrease in attack frequency and decrease in heme use), some patients 
continued to experience breakthrough porphyria attacks during the treatment period, indicating 
that a higher dose may be required.  
The duration of dosing in this study is supported by the overall favorable safety profile of 
ALN -AS1 in the ongoing clinical study ALN -AS1-001 and th e absence of new findings in 
nonclinical studies with ALN -AS1.  
1.6. Clinical Data Summary  
1.6.1.  Clinical Pharmacodynamics  
Dosing has been completed in Part A and Part B of the study.  In both Parts A and B of the study, 
durable and dose -dependent reductions of ALAS1  mRNA (up to 66% in the 2.5 mg/kg dose 
group) as measured by cERD  were observed after ALN -AS1 treatment.  ALAS1 reductions were 
highly correlated with reductions in ALA (mean maximal 86%) PBG (mean maximal 95%) 
levels in a dose -dependent manner and were su stained for ≥180 days.  
Dosing is currently ongoing in Part C of the study. The mean maximal reduction in ALAS1 
mRNA  relative to baseline in ALN -AS1-treated patients in Cohort 1 (2.5 mg/kg Q3M) was 39% 
and in Cohort 2 (2.5 mg/kg Q1M) 66%.  All patients tre ated with ALN -AS1 also had decreases 
in their peak ALA and PBG levels in the treatment period compared to the run -in period, along 
with reduced fluctuations in these levels in the treatment period ( data not shown) . No reductions 
were observed in the placeb o-treated patients.  
1.6.2.  Clinical Activity  
Clinical activity was not evaluated in Parts A and B of the study because ASHE patients included 
in this study were not actively experiencing attacks of porphyria.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 8, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  28 
  Dosing is currently ongoing in Part C of the study. A ll patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 were enrolled 
in a run -in phase for 10 -15 weeks that was followed by a treatment phase for up to 24 weeks.  No 
investigational product was administered during the run -in phase.  Therefore, each patient acted 
as their own cont rol, allowing for individual ALA / PBG levels, and overall attack rate while on 
ALN -AS1 treatment to be compared to that observed in the run -in phase.   
Figure  1 shows in Cohort 1 ALN -AS1-treated patients there was a 74% mean decrease in the 
annualized attack rate for the treatment period versus the run -in period (range: 63 -94% 
reduction), compared wi th a 23% decrease in the annualized attack rate for the placebo -treated 
patient.  In ALN -AS1-treated patients this was accompanied by an approximate 76% mean 
decrease in annualized acute hemin usage (range 52 -95%) and a 10.3 times increase in the 
maximal a ttack free interval compared to run -in period (range 4.2 -16.3).

Run-in 
 
Figure  2 shows in Cohort 2 ALN -AS1-treated patients, there was a 58% mean decrease in the 
annualized attack rate for the treatment period versus the run -in period (range: 45 -76% 
reduction).  This comp ares favorably with data from the placebo -treated patient who showed a 
34% reduction in the annualized attack rate for the treatment period versus the run -in period.  In 
ALN -AS1-treated patients, the reduction in attack rate was accompanied by a 92% mean 
decrease in annualized hemin usage (range 84 -100%) and a 2.7x increase in the mean maximal 
attack free interval compared to run -in period (range 2.1 -3.2).

  1.6.3.  Clinical Safety  
In Part A and Part B of Study ALN -AS1-001, a total of 11 patients (11/13; 85.0%) who received 
ALN -AS1 reported at least 1 AE.  All 5 placebo -treated patients (5/5; 100%) reported at least 1 
AE.  AEs considered possibly or definitely related to ALN -AS1 were reported in 5 patients 
(5/13; 38%): diarr hoea, dyspepsia, hematochezia, injection site erythema, injection site pain, 
blood creatinine increased, glomerular filtration rate decreased, and hypoesthesia (each AE 
reported only by an individual patient; 1/13; 8% each).  There were 2 SAEs of abdominal  pain: 1 
patient each in the 0.035 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg ALN -AS1 dose groups.  Both were considered to 
be not related and resolved without sequelae.  There were no AEs leading to discontinuation.  All 
AEs were mild or moderate in severity, except for 1 of th e SAEs of abdominal pain (0.10 mg/kg 
dose group), which was considered severe. Adverse events related to abnormal laboratory values 
were seen in 1 patient in the 0.35 mg/kg ALN -AS1 dose group who had AEs of ALT increased 
and AST increased, which were moder ate and considered by the Investigator to be unrelated to 
ALN -AS1.  No clinically significant findings were observed with routine monitoring of CRP and 
a panel of 9 proinflammatory cytokines collected predose and up to 24 hours post -dose.  There 
were no ot her clinically significant laboratory abnormalities related to study drug or changes in 
vital signs, or ECGs in patients who were administered ALN AS1 or placebo.  
Dosing is ongoing in Part C of the study. All patients who received ALN -AS1 in cohort 1 and 2  
reported at least 1 AE.  AEs that were reported in at least 2 subjects were nausea in 3 patients 
(50%) and abdominal pain, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, headache, cough and oropharyngeal pain 
in 2 patients (33.3%) each.  All AEs were mild or moderate in seve rity.  AEs considered possibly 
or definitely related to ALN -AS1 were reported in 4 patients (66.6%), 1 each:  renal impairment 
in Cohort 1 and injection site reaction, myalgia, and headache in Cohort 2. Both placebo -treated 
patients reported AEs.  No AE wa s experienced in more than 1 patient.  
In Part C, Cohort 1 or 2, there were no SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation in patients 
administered ALN -AS1 or placebo. No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities related to 
study drug or changes in vital signs, ECG, or physical exam findings were observed in patients 
administered ALN -AS1 or placebo.  
Part C Cohort 3 5.0 mg/kg SC monthly dosing is ongoing.  In this cohort there was one fatal 
SAE of acute pancreatitis, which was determined to be unlikely rela ted to study drug or placebo 
by the Investigator due to the presence of gall bladder sludge found at the time of her 
presentation.  Contributors to this patient's adverse clinical course included: pre -existing chronic 
debilitation from recurrent AIP attack s requiring monthly hospitalization, porphyria -attributed 
quadriplegia requiring nursing home care, delay in hospital admission and complications from 
thromboembolism (multiple risk factors included pancreatitis, obesity, immobilisation from 
quadriparesis and recent hospitalization for infected portacath removal).  Serum lipase was added 
to all scheduled laboratory assessments in November 2016 as part of additional safety 
monitoring. To date, all lipase results (available in 11 of 15 subjects) have been at or below the 
upper limit of normal with no trends seen with dosing of study drug or placebo.  
Further information on the safety, efficacy, PK and PD of ALN -AS1 are available in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.

  1.6.4.  Drug -Drug Interactions  
An open -label drug -drug int eraction (DDI) study (ALN -AS1-004) was conducted in AIP patients 
who are ASHE to evaluate the effect of a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1 administered SC 
on the pharmacokinetics of probe substrates for 5  major CYP enzymes that account for the 
metabolism o f approximately 80% of prescribed drugs. (31, 32)  Results from this s tudy 
demonstrated that ALN -AS1 treatment resulted in weak to moderate reduction in the metabolic 
activity of some of the 5  CYP enzymes studied, thereby leading to higher concentrations of some 
substrates and their metabolites.  Treatment with ALN -AS1 resul ted in an approximately 3 -fold 
increase in exposure (as measured by AUC) of caffeine (a sensitive substrate for CYP1A2) and 
an approximately 2 -fold increase in exposure of dextromethorphan (a sensitive substrate for 
CYP2D6).  Exposure of midazolam (a sensi tive substrate for CYP3A4) and omeprazole (a 
sensitive substrate for CYP2C19) increased less than 2 -fold after treatment with ALN -AS1.  
There was no effect of ALN -AS1 treatment on losartan (a sensitive substrate for CYP2C9).  
1.7. Benefit -Risk Assessment  
Patient s participating in this study may experience a reduced number or severity of porphyria 
attacks, reduced treatment with IV hemin, and/or reduced requirement for pain medication.  As 
presented in Section  1.6, emerging data  demonstrate that patients given ALN -AS1 experienced 
reduced ALA/PBG levels, decreased attack frequency and reduced heme usage in the 24 -week 
treatment period compared to the 12 -week ru n-in period in Study ALN -AS1-001 
As detailed in Section  1.6, a fatal SAE of hemorrhagic pancreatitis was reported but deemed to 
be unlikely related to study drug.  However, the potentially non -adverse nonclinical finding of 
angiectasis in the islets of Langerhans (endocrine, not exocrine region) of the rat pancrea s (see 
Investigator Brochure), do not exclude a potential association between ALN -AS1 and the SAE of 
hemorrhagic pancreatitis.  
The important potential risks associated with administration of ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP 
are as follows:  
• Injection site react ions (ISRs):  ALN -AS1 is administered by SC injection.  In the 
ongoing ALN -AS1 clinical study, AEs of ISRs have been infrequently reported and 
have been mild to moderate in severity with single dosing.  Injection site rotation and 
close monitoring have bee n implemented in ALN -AS1 clinical studies to reduce the 
potential for ISRs.  
• Pancreatitis: Since an association between ALN -AS1 and the fatal SAE of 
hemorrhagic pancreatitis can not be ruled out, patients will undergo routine 
monitoring of systemic and pan creatic inflammation and coagulation throughout the 
study.  Hematology, chemistry and coagulation results are required to be available 
prior to each dose.  
• Liver transaminase abnormalities:  As ALN -AS1 is targeted for delivery to the liver, 
and reversible h epatic changes were observed in some animal species, there is a 
potential for development of liver function test ( LFT) abnormalities.  To minimize the 
potential for LFT abnormalities, patients are required to have adequate liver function 
at study entry and  LFTs are monitored during the study.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 8, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  31 
  • Anaphylactic reactions:  There is a potential risk of developing a severe allergic 
reaction with ALN -AS1 administration.  In the present study, one patient in the 
2.5 mg/kg monthly dose group with a history of asthma a nd multiple allergies 
experienced an SAE of anaphylactic reaction that was determined by the Investigator 
to be definitely related to study drug given the temporal relationship of ALN -AS1 
treatment to the onset of the reaction (within minutes).  The patien t was treated and 
recovered and was discontinued from the study.  Guidance on dose administration 
and monitoring for anaphylactic reactions has been included in this protocol. The 
complete summary of the clinical and nonclinical data relevant to the investi gational 
drug and its study in human subjects is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
• Homocysteine elevations:  Blood homocysteine levels may be increased in patients 
with AHP, vitamin deficiencies, or chronic kidney disease. (33-35)  During treatment 
with ALN -AS1, increases in blood homocysteine levels have been observed 
compared to levels before treatment.  The clinical relevance of the elevations in blood 
homocysteine during ALN -AS1 treatment is unknown.  The protocol includes 
monitoring for changes in blood homocysteine levels during treatment with 
ALN -AS1.  Vitamin B6 supplementation is recommended for patients with elevated 
homocysteine levels (see Secti on 6.3).

4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.1. Summary of Study Design  
This is a Phase 1/2 multicenter, open -label extension study to evaluate the long -term safety and 
clinical activity of ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP who completed study ALN -AS1-001.  The 
study will be conducted at up to 8 clinical study centers worldwide.  
The last assessments performed, determining previous study (AL N-AS1-001) completion, will 
serve as the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed 
since the last assessment, safety assessments (eg, ECG and clinical laboratory tests) will be 
repeated before administration of ALN -AS1.  It is anticipated that patients will begin ALN -AS1 
administration in this study within 6 months after the last dose of study drug in the previous 
study.  Eligibility will be confirmed during Screening/Baseline and before administration of the 
first dos e of ALN -AS1 (Day 1).  Patients will undergo assessments at the clinical study center 
every month for the first 3 months.  Then, through Month 6, and according to the dosing regimen 
selected, assessments will take place at the clinical study center or via a phone contact (for an 
every month dosing regimen, visits will be every month; for an every 3 months dosing regimen, 
visits will be every 3 months; see Section  6.2.2 ).  After a patient has completed 12 months of 
ALN -AS1 administration in this study (6 months in an every month dosing regimen), and where 
applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, study procedures, including 
ALN -AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional (as 
indicated in the Schedules of Assessments in  Table 1, Table  2, and Table  3; and Table  5, Table  6, 
and Table  7 in Appendix Section  11.2).  If the patient is unable to come to the study site, and a 
visit by a home healthcare professional is not possible due to circumstances related to the 
COVID -19 pandemic, ALN -AS1 may be admi nistered by the patient or the caregiver under the 
oversight of the Investigator, and following consultation with the medical monitor, as allowed by 
applicable country and local regulations.  In such cases, the patient or caregiver must receive 
appropriate  training on ALN -AS1 administration and the use of epinephrine (epi pen or 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)

  equivalent) prior to dosing.  This measure is intended to remain in effect only during periods of 
time when the COVID -19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the st udy site or 
healthcare professionals to go to patients' homes for dosing.  Study procedures may occur at the 
patient’s home at the discretion of the Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, 
patients are required to complete at least 1 visit  at the clinical study center every 3 months for the 
first year, and thereafter every 6 months through the end of the treatment period.  Additional 
visits to collect c linical laboratory samples may occur at home at any point during the treatment 
period, wi thin 14 days prior to scheduled dose administration.  Patients will return to the clinical 
study center for a posttreatment follow -up visit after administration of the last dose of ALN -AS1.   
An ALA/PBG Monitoring/EOS visit will be conducted either at the c linical study center or via 
phone contact, unless treatment continues with ALN -AS1.  
Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain 
assessments, and narcotic use.  Additionally, patients will be encouraged to re port to the clinical 
study center if they experience a porphyria attack through Month 49.  In the event that patients 
are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laboratory sample 
collection kits containing instructions for  collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical 
study center, if possible, will be provided.  Patients will be contacted by phone after a porphyria 
attack to record attack details.  If patients are experiencing signs and symptoms of a porphyria 
attac k when ALN -AS1 administration is scheduled, the Investigator will determine whether 
administration of ALN -AS1 is appropriate.  If patients are treated for a porphyria attack at a 
health care facility (eg, hospital, emergency department, infusion center, or  outpatient clinic) 
other than the clinical study center, copies of medical records, including discharge summaries, 
will be requested.   
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review safety and tolerability data collected during the 
study with the primary pu rpose of protecting the safety of patients participating in the study (see 
Section  4.6). 
Patients may receive ALN -AS1 as long as they do not fulfill  any of the study discontinuation 
criteria (see Section  5.3) or until ALN -AS1 is commercially available in the patient’s territory or 
the ALN -AS1 develop ment program is discontinued (whichever comes first).  
All patients are asked to participate in a Posttreatment Follow -up visit after they have received 
their last dose of ALN -AS1.

This is an open -label study; all p atients will receive ALN -AS1.  A combination of the clinical 
study center number and screening number will create the uniqu e patient identifier.  The clinical 
study center number will be assigned by the Sponsor.  Upon signing the Informed Consent Form 
(ICF), the patient will be assigned a screening number by the clinical study site, which will be 
the same unique patient identi fier assigned in the previous study (ALN -AS1-001).  The 
Investigator, or delegate, will confirm that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of 
the exclusion criteria.  
4.5. Blinding  
This is an open -label study, and all patients will receive ALN -AS1.  
4.6. Safety Review Committee  
An SRC will be involved in the conduct of this study.  The SRC has the responsibility for 
monitoring the safety of the study participants.  The SRC will perform periodic reviews of safety 
and tolerability data during the cours e of the clinical study at least every 3 months for the first 6 
months of the study and thereafter at least every 6 months.  The SRC may also meet on an ad hoc 
basis for review of emergent safety and tolerability data, as defined in the SRC Charter for thi s 
clinical study.  The SRC will not stop the study for efficacy.  
The SRC will be comprised of the following members:  Principal Investigator(s), or designee(s), 
the Sponsor Medical Monitor, and the Study Medical Monitor.  
The membership of the SRC and repor ting structure are further defined in the SRC Charter.

barrier met hod (eg, condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap), or a double barrier method of 
contraception for those WOCBP for whom a hormonal method of contraception is 
medically contraindicated due to underlying disease  (see Section  6.4 for acceptable 
methods of contraception ).   
4. Willing and able to comply with the study requirements and to provide written informed 
consent  
5.2. Exclusion Criteria  
Each patient must not meet any of the following exclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment in 
this study : 
1. Alanine transaminase ≥2.0×ULN or total bilirubin ≥2 mg/dL (unless bilirubin elevation is

in Renal Disease formula)  
3. History of multiple drug allergies or history of allergic reaction to an oligonucleotide or 
to N-acetyl galactosamine ligand (GalNAc)  
4. Received an investigational agent, other than ALN -AS1, or who are in follow -up of 
another clinical study of an investigational agent within 90 days before study drug 
administration  
5. Other medical conditions or comorbidities which, in the opinion of the Investigator, 
would interfere with study compliance or data in terpretation  
5.3. Discontinuation of Study Drug and/or Study  
Patients or their legal guardians (in the case that the patient is a minor) are free to discontinue 
treatment and/or study or withdraw their consent at any time and for any reason, without penalty 
to their continuing medical care.  Any discontinuation of treatment or of the study must be fully 
documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF), and should be followed up by the 
Investigator.  The Investigator may withdraw a patient from the study at a ny time if this is 
considered to be in the patient’s best interest.  
Discontinuation of study drug and withdrawal from the study are described in Section  5.3.1  and 
Section  5.3.2 , respectively.  If a patient stops participation from the study or withdraws consent 
from the study, he/she will not be able to re -enroll in the study.

Amendment 8, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  36 
  5.3.1.  Discontinuation of Study Drug  
The Inves tigator or designee may discontinue dosing in a patient if the patient:  
• Is in violation of the protocol  
• Experiences a SAE considered to be possibly or definitely related to the study drug or 
an intolerable AE  
• Becomes pregnant  
• Is found to be considerably n oncompliant with the protocol -requirements  
Patients who are pregnant will be discontinued from study drug dosing immediately (see 
Section  7.5.6.6  for reporting and follow -up of pregnancy).  A positive urine pregnancy test 
should be confirmed by a serum p regnancy test prior to discontinuing the study drug.  
If a patient discontinues dosing due to a serious adverse event (SAE), the SAE should be 
followed as described in Section  7.5.6 .  When a patient disc ontinues study drug dosing, the 
primary reason must be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  Patients who 
discontinue study drug and remain on study may receive treatment consistent with local standard 
practice for their disease per Investig ator judgement, as applicable.  
Patients who discontinue treatment will be asked to complete an early termination (ET) visit at 
which all Month 49 visit procedures will be performed; they must also return for a safety -follow -
up visit 3 months (84 [+14] days ) after their last dose of ALN -AS1.  
5.3.2.  Discontinuation from the Study  
A patient or their legal guardian may decide to stop the patient’s participation in the study at any 
time.  Patients considering to stop the study should be informed that they can discontinue 
treatment and complete study assessments including follow -up, as per the SOA, or alternatively 
may complete any minimal assessments for which the patient consents. The Investigator may 
withdraw a patient at any time if this is considered to be in the patient’s best interest.  
However, study integrity and interpretation is best maintained if all randomized patients continue 
study assessments and follow -up.  Stopping study participation could mean:  
• If a patient discontinues from the study, he/she w ill be asked to complete an early 
termination (ET) visit at which all Month 49 visit procedures will be performed; the 
patient must also return for a safety -follow -up visit at 3 months (84 [+14] days) after 
his/her last dose of ALN -AS1.  
• A patient can stop taking the study drug and stop study -related visits, but allow the 
investigator and study team to review the patient’s medical records, public records or 
be contacted in order to receive information about the patient’s health  
When a patient stops the study , the discontinuation and reason for discontinuation must be 
recorded  in the appropriate section of the electronic case report form (eCRF) and all efforts will 
be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible.  If a patient stops t he 
study due to an adverse event (AE), including an SAE, the AE should be followed as described 
in Section  7.5.6 . 
If the patient wants to stop parti cipation in the study, he/she should notify the study doctor in 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)

  writing or in any other form that may be locally required. The personal data already collected 
during the study, including patient’s biological samples, will still be used together with the da ta 
collected on other patients in the study according to the informed consent and applicable laws.  
In addition to stopping participation in the study, the patient could decide to withdraw his/her 
consent as explained in Section  5.3.3  
5.3.3.  Withdrawal  of Consent to Collect and Process the Patient’s Personal Data  
The patient may decide to withdraw his/her consent informing the study doctor at any time in 
writi ng, or in any other form that may be locally required.  This  means that the patient wants to 
stop participation in the study and any further collection of his/her personal data.  
• The sponsor will continue to keep and use a patient's study information (including 
any data resulting from the analysis of the patient's biological samples until time of 
withdrawal) according to applicable law.  This is done to guarantee the validity of the 
study, determine the effects of the study treatment, and ensure comple teness of study 
documentation.  
• The patient can also request that collected samples be destroyed or returned (to the 
extent it is permitted by applicable law) at any time.  
• Patients who withdraw their consent to collect and use personal data should 
understan d that public records may be reviewed to determine the patient’s survival 
status as allowed per local and national regulations.    
In US and Japan, otherwise, samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal may still be used 
for further testing/analysis  in accordance with the terms of the protocol and of the informed 
consent form.  
In EU and rest of world, in any event, samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal will 
not be used any longer, unless permitted by applicable law. They will be stored o r destroyed 
according to applicable legal requirements.  
5.3.4.  Replacement of Patients  
Patients discontinuing from study drug or withdrawing from the study will not be replaced.  
6. TREATMENTS  
6.1. Treatments Administered  
ALN -AS1 Solution for Injection (SC use) is a clear , colorless to pale yellow solution essentially 
free of particulates.  ALN -AS1 will be supplied by the Sponsor as a sterile solution for SC 
injection.  
Study drug supplied for this study must not be used for any purpose other than the present study 
and must  not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study.  Study drug that has been 
dispensed to a patient and returned unused must not be re -dispensed to a different patient.

  6.2. Investigational Study Drug  
Detailed information describing the preparation, handling, and storage, packaging and labeling, 
as well as study drug accountability for ALN -AS1 is provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.2.1.  Description  
ALN -AS1 Solution for Injection (SC use) is comprised of a synthetic, siRNA targeting ALAS1 
and bearing a triante nnary GalNAc ligand conjugated to the sense strand, formulated in 
phosphate buffer.  
6.2.2.  Dose and Administration  
The study starting dose of ALN -AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg ALN -AS1 as an SC injection administered 
every 3 months ( Table 1, Table 2, and Table  3). Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may 
approve changes to the ALN -AS1 dosing regimen, including decreases in the dose level and 
changes in dosing frequency ( Table  5, Table  6, and Table  7 in Section  11.2).  However, any dose 
and dosing regimen w ill not exceed a previously explored dose level or frequen cy that was 
determined to be safe and well -tolerated in study ALN -AS1-001. SRC, Health Authority and 
Ethics Committee approval must be sought prior to dose level escalation above 5.0 mg/kg in 
accordance with local Regulatory requirements.  See Section  6.2.3  for details on dose 
modifications.  
The study drug should be injected into the abdomen or upper arms or thighs.  Detailed 
instructions for study dru g administration are presented in the Pharmacy Manual. As is consistent 
with good medical practice for subcutaneous drug administration, patients will be observed for a 
minimum of 20 minutes after each injection.   Treatment for anaphylactic reactions shou ld be 
readily available where patients are being dosed, and follow country and/or local hospital 
treatment guidelines as shown in Table  8.(36) 
ALN -AS1 will be administered by a qualified and authorized health care professional trained in 
the recognition and management of anaphylactic reactions.  After a patient has completed 12 
months of ALN -AS1 administration in this study (6  months in an every month dosing regimen), 
study drug administration may be conducted at a location other than the study center by a home 
healthcare professional, where applicable country and local regulations and infrastru cture allow, 
after consultation with the medical monitor, during particular study visits, as specified in the 
Schedules of Assessments.  If the patient is unable to come to the study site, and a visit by a 
home healthcare professional is not possible due t o circumstances related to the COVID -19 
pandemic, ALN -AS1 may be administered by the patient or the caregiver under the oversight of 
the Investigator, and following consultation with the medical monitor, as allowed by applicable 
country and local regulatio ns.  In such cases, the patient or caregiver must receive appropriate 
training on ALN -AS1 administration and the use of epinephrine (epi pen or equivalent) prior to 
dosing.  This measure is intended to remain in effect only during periods of time when the 
COVID -19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the study site or healthcare 
professionals to go to patients' homes for dosing.  However, study drug administration at the 
study center should be considered for patients who have ongoing study drug-related AEs or 
known risk factors for developing anaphylactic reaction, including but not limited to: a prior 
history of anaphylactic reaction to food, medications or due to unknown etiology, worsening 
injection site reactions with repeat dosing, or a nyone in the opinion of the investigator that would

  benefit from clinical observation following dosing.  Patients are required to complete at least 1 
visit at the clinical study center every 3 months for the first year, and thereafter every 6 months 
throug h the end of the treatment period.  Additional visits to collect clinical laboratory samples 
may occur at home at any point during the treatment period, within 14 days prior to scheduled 
dose administration.  
If a patient does not receive a dose of ALN -AS1 within the specified dosing window, the 
Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor.  After such consultation, the dose may be 
administered or considered missed and not administered.  
Patients will be permitted to miss an occasional dose of study drug; however, if a patient misses 
2 consecutive doses, the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, will discuss 
whether the patient will be able to continue on the study.  
Deta iled instructions for study drug administration are found in the Pharmacy Manual.  In 
addition, instructions and procedures related to administration of ALN -AS1 by a patient or 
caregiver will be provided in the Patient/Caregiver Storage and Administration Instructions.  
6.2.3.  Dose Modifications  
6.2.3.1.  Study Population Dose Modifications  
During the study, dose modifications are permitted for the study population, or based on the dose 
cohort into which patients were originally randomized in study ALN -AS1-001.  Following SR C 
review of emerging safety and tolerability data from Part C of study ALN -AS1-001, or from this 
study (ALN -AS1-002), the dose and dosing regimen may be modified.  However, the dose and 
dosing regimen of ALN -AS1 will not exceed a previously explored dose a nd dosing regimen that 
was determined to be safe and well -tolerated in study ALN -AS1-001.  Patients enrolling in this 
study after a dose modification decision has been implemented may start at the newly identified 
dose and regimen.  
6.2.3.2.  Individual Dose Modifica tions  
Dose modifications are permitted for individual patients.  If a patient has a study drug related AE 
of a recurrent ISR, severe ISR, or clinically significant LFT abnormality and the Investigator has 
concerns regarding further ALN -AS1 administration, the Medical Monitor and Investigator will 
review all available safety data for the patient.  Based on this review, a dose reduction to half the 
previously administered dose (eg, a 5.0 mg/kg dose would be reduced to a 2.5 mg/kg dose) or a 
reduction in dosin g frequency from monthly to every 3 months is permitted.  Subsequent ALN -
AS1 administration at the previous dose may be considered based on the judgment of the 
Investigator and Medical Monitor.  
6.2.3.2.1.  Monitoring and Dosing Rules in Patients with Potential Cases o f Anaphylactic 
Reaction   
An anaphylactic reaction is a severe, potentially fatal, systemic allergic reaction with acute onset 
(minutes to hours).  For reference see Section  11.3.(36) 
Stop administering the study medication immediately  if an anaphylactic reaction to the study 
medication is suspected.  Study medication must be permanently discontinued in patients for 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 8, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  40 
  whom an anaphylactic reaction is assessed as related to the study medication.  
Laboratory testing:  Obtain blood sample for tryptase, total IgE, and ADA  antidrug antibodies 
(ADA) ideally within 15 minutes to 3 hours after the onset of a suspected anaphylactic reaction; 
however, up to 6 hours is acceptable.  An additional blood sample to assess tryptase, total IgE, 
and ADA shoul d be obtained between  1 to 2 weeks from onset of event.  Local laboratory may 
be used to analyze samples; however, parallel samples should be sent to the central laboratory for 
analysis.  Sample collection and shipping instructions are included in the Labo ratory Manual.  
Reporting : The PI or designee must notify the sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the 
occurrence of a suspected case of anaphylactic reaction or being informed of the case as required 
for AEs of Clinical Interest (AECI) and SAEs, per AE r eporting requirements (Section  7.5.6.1 ,  
Section  7.5.6.2  and 7.5.6.3 ). 
6.2.4.  Preparation, Handling, and Storage  
Staff at each clinical study center, or the home healthcare professional, will be responsible for 
preparation of ALN -AS1 doses, according to procedures de tailed in the Pharmacy Manual.  In 
cases where ALN -AS1 is administered at home by a patient/caregiver, dosing may be prepared 
and administered by the patient/caregiver according to procedures detailed in the 
Patient/Caregiver Storage and Administration Ins tructions.  No special procedures for the safe 
handling of study drug are required.  
Study drug will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately 5±3°C.  
A Sponsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, 
storage, dispensing procedures, and records.  
Additional storage and preparation details are provided in the Pharmacy Manual and the 
Patient/Caregiver Storage and Administration Instructions  
6.2.5.  Packaging and Labeling  
All packaging, labeling, and production of study drug will be in compliance with current Good 
Manufacturing Practice specifications, as well as applicable local regulations.  Study drug labels 
and external packaging will include all appropriate information as per local labeling 
requirements.  
Additi onal details will be available in the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.2.6.  Accountability  
The Investigator or designee will maintain accurate records of receipt and the condition of the 
study drug supplied for this study, including dates of receipt.  In addition, accurate rec ords will 
be kept of when and how much study drug is dispensed and administered to each patient in the 
study.  Any reasons for departure from the protocol dispensing regimen must also be recorded.  
At the completion of the study, there will be a final recon ciliation of all study drugs.  All used, 
partially used, and unused study drug will be returned to the Sponsor (or designee) or destroyed 
at the clinical study center according to applicable regulations.   
Further instructions about drug accountability are  detailed in the Pharmacy Manual.

  6.3. Concomitant Medications  
Use of concomitant medications will be recorded on the patient’s case report form (CRF) as 
indicated in the Schedules of Assessments ( Table 1, Table  2, and Table  3; and Table  5, Table  6, 
and Table  7 in Appendix Section  11.2).  This includes all prescription medications, herbal 
preparations, over the counter (OTC) medications, vitamins, and  minerals.  Any changes in 
medications during the study will also be recorded on the CRF.  
Any concomitant medication that is required for the patient’s welfare may be administered by the 
Investigator.  However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding 
the medication are recorded on the eCRF.  Concomitant medication will be coded using an 
internationally recognized and accepted coding dictionary.  
During treatment with ALN -AS1, blood homocysteine levels may show an increas e compared to 
levels before treatment.  Blood homocysteine levels will be assessed as indicated in the Schedule 
of Assessments (see Table  3 or Table  7).  It is recommended that patients with increased blood 
homocysteine levels recei ve a supplement containing vitamin B6.  All vitamin  supplements  
should be recorded on the concomitant medications eCRF.  
Patients with porphyria could have altered hepatic heme synthesis, and treatment with ALN -AS1 
could also modulate this pathway and secon darily impact CYP enzyme activity.  Results from a 
DDI study in AIP patients who are ASHE are presented in Section  1.6.4 .  The DDI study 
demonstrated th at ALN -AS1 treatment resulted in weak to moderate reduction in activity in 
some of the CYP enzymes resulting in corresponding low to moderate increase in the plasma 
levels of drugs that are metabolized by these CYP enzymes.  Based on the moderate decrease in 
CYP2D6 or CYP1A2 activity, investigators will review all concomitant medications that are 
primarily metabolized by these enzymes and monitor the patient’s clinical response to these 
medications during the study.  Medications metabolized primarily by CYP 2D6 and CYP1A2 
with a narrow therapeutic index (ie that require regular laboratory monitoring) may need to be 
monitored more frequently to determine if a dose adjustment of the concomitant medication is 
required.  For patients who require new medications w hile on study, selection of medications that 
are not primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 or CYP1A2 should be considered.  Refer to the 
individual product’s prescription information to determine if there is a need to monitor 
concomitant medications for differen ces in safety or efficacy of the medication based on reported 
DDIs with CYP2D6 or CYP1A2.  For more detailed and up -to-date information on CYP 
substrates, see: 
https://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/developmentresources/druginteractionsl
abeli ng/ucm093664.htm.  
Patients are not permitted to be on hemin prophylaxis at Screening; however, patients are 
permitted to receive concomitant hemin treatment for the management of acute porphyria 
attacks.  Patients experiencing significant breakthrough atta cks while enrolled in this study, 
necessitating frequent hemin treatment, may receive hemin prophylaxis if in the Investigator’s 
judgment this is clinically beneficial to the patient.  The Investigator should contact with the 
Sponsor and Medical Monitor be fore prophylactic hemin treatment.  The dose, regimen, and 
dates of administration will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF.   
Pain medication (eg, opiates, opioids, narcotic analgesics) and glucose administration are 
permitted for the management of porphyria and for acute porphyria attacks.

Amendment 8, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  42 
  If patients use nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory medications intermittently or chronically, they 
must have been able to tolerate them with no previous side effects (eg, gastric distress or 
bleeding).   
Standard vita mins and topical medications are permitted; however, topical steroids must not be 
applied anywhere near the injection site(s) unless medically indicated.  
6.4. Contraceptive Requirements  
No data are available on the use of ALN -AS1 in pregnancy; however, there is  no suspicion of 
human teratogenicity based on class effects or genotoxic potential.  ALN -AS1 was neither 
genotoxic nor clastogenic in in vitro and in vivo studies.   
WOCBP must be willing to use acceptable methods of contraception 14 days before first dos e, 
throughout study participation, and for 90 days after last dose administration.   
Birth control methods which may be considered as acceptable include:  
• Established use of oral, implantable, injectable, transdermal hormonal, or intrauterine 
hormone -releas ing system as methods of contraception.  WOCBP using hormonal 
methods of contraception must also use a barrier method  (condom or occlusive cap 
[diaphragm or cervical/vault cap] in conjunction with spermicide [eg, foam, gel, film, 
cream, or suppository]).  
• If hormonal methods of contraception are medically contraindicated for WOCBP due 
to underlying disease, a double -barrier method (combination of male condom with 
either cap, diaphragm, or sponge, in conjunction with spermicide) is also considered 
an acceptab le method of contraception.  
• Placement of an intrauterine device  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post -vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the 
study,  the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient)  
• Sexual abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
patient, is considered an acceptable method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual in tercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study 
drug (defined above).  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not considered sexual abstinence and do 
not meet criteria fo r an acceptable method of birth control.  As determined by the 
investigator, the reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to 
the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Abstinent patie nts must agree to use 1 of the abovementioned contraceptive methods 
if they start a heterosexual relationship during the study and continue to do so for the 
entire period of risk associated with the study drug (defined above).  
• WOCBP includes any female pat ient who has experienced menarche and who is not 
postmenopausal or permanently sterilized (eg, bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, 
or bilateral salpingectomy).  Postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  43 
  months without an alternative medical cause, confirmed by follicle stimulating 
hormone level within the postmenopausal range.  
6.5. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with study drug administration will be verified through observation by study 
personnel or trained home healthcare professionals.  
7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
The schedules of study assessments are provided in Table 1, Table  2, and Table  3; and Table  5, 
Table  6, and Table  7. 
Where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow for home healthcare, 
healthcare may take place at a location other than the clinical trial site to perform study 
assessments including targeted physic al exam/body system assessment, assessments for vital 
signs, and collection of blood and urine samples for safety laboratory assessments, and PD 
assessments, at all timepoints as specified in the Schedule of Assessments.  
7.1. Screening/Baseline Assessments  
Informed consent, patient demographic data, and eligibility criteria will be confirmed at 
Screening/Baseline.  An interval medical history/disease history will be obtained at 
Screening/Baseline.  The last assessments performed, determining previous study 
(ALN -AS1-001) completion, will serve as the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If 
more than 60 days have elapsed since the last assessment, clinical laboratory tests and ECGs will 
be repeated before administration of ALN -AS1.  
7.2. Clinical Activity Asses sments  
The clinical activity of ALN -AS1 will be assessed by the frequency and characteristics of 
porphyria attacks including, but not limited to, duration, treatment, and severity of porphyria 
attacks and number and duration of visits to a health care sett ing for acute porphyria care (eg, 
hospital, emergency department, infusion center, or outpatient clinic).  Concomitant hemin 
administration will also be recorded.

Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain 
assessments, and narcotic use.  
7.2.2.  Brief Pain Inventory -Short Form Questionnaire  
The Brief Pain Inventory -Short Form (BPI -SF) questionnaire will be used to evaluate pain .(37)  
The BPI will be completed as part of the patient diary.  
7.3. Pharmacodynamic  Assessments  
Blood and urine samples will be collected for assessment of ALN -AS1 PD parameters.  The PD 
effect of ALN -AS1 will be evaluated by urine ALA and PBG levels.  Blood and urine samples 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 8, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  44 
  will be collected for assessment of circulating ALAS1 mRNA lev els in serum and in urine.  
Analysis for blood and urine PD parameters will take place at a central laboratory.   
Details regarding the processing and aliquoting of samples for storage and analyses will be 
provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
7.4. Pharmacokinetic  Assessments  
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate the PK profile of ALN -AS1 at the time points in the 
Schedule of Assessments.  A detailed schedule of time points for the collection of blood samples 
for PK analysis is in Table  4 in Appendix Section  11.1). 
The concentration of ALN -AS1 will be determined using a validated assay.  Details regarding 
the processing, shipping, and analysis of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
7.5. Safety Assessments  
The assessment of safety during the course of the study will consist of the surveilla nce and 
recording of AEs including SAEs, recording of concomitant medications and measurements of 
vital signs, physical examination, and ECG findings and clinical laboratory evaluations.  
Safety will be monitored over the course of the study by an SRC as de scribed in Section  4.6. 
7.5.1.  Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory 
rate.  Vital signs  will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be consistent for each 
patient), after the patient has rested comfortably for at least 10 minutes.  Blood pressure should 
be taken using the same arm throughout the study.  Body temperature will be  obtained in degrees 
Celsius, heart rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in beats per minute, and 
respiration rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in breaths per minute.  
For the safety of the patient, additional vital sign ass essments may be added at the discretion of 
the Investigator.  
7.5.2.  Weight and Height  
Height will be measured in centimeters at the Screening/Baseline visit only.  Body weight will be 
measured in kilograms.  Body mass index will be calculated in the database.  
Body weight measured on the dosing day will be used to calculate the dose of ALN -AS1 through 
M12.  After M12, weight obtained within 6 months during a study center visit or offsite may be 
used for dosing calculations.  
7.5.3.  Physical Examination  
Complete physical  examinations will include the examination of the following:  general 
appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, chest/respiratory, heart/cardiovascular, 
gastrointestinal/liver, musculoskeletal/extremities, dermatological/skin, thyroid/neck, lymph 
node s, and neurological/psychiatric.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 8, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  45 
  Targeted physical examinations will include the examination of the following:  general 
appearance, chest/respiratory, heart/cardiovascular, gastrointestinal/liver, and 
neurological/psychiatric.  
7.5.4.  Electrocardiogram  
Triplicate standard 12 -lead ECGs will be performed using central ECG equipment, with readings 
approximately 1 minute apart and recorded as specified in the Schedule of Assessments.  Patients 
should be seated or supine for at least 5 minutes before each ECG is obtaine d.  The 
electrophysiological parameters assessed will be rhythm, ventricular rate, PR interval, QRS 
duration, QT interval, ST and T waves, Bazett -corrected QT interval (QTcB), and Fridericia 
corrected QT interval (QTcF).  
When ECG and blood sample collectio n occur at the same time, ECGs should be performed 
before blood samples are drawn.  
Using central ECG equipment, triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine 
position after the patient has rested comfortably for at least 5  minutes.   
In all patients receiving ≤2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1, it is required that ECGs will be obtained on at 
least 2 separate clinic visits (D1, and Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or 18) , each of which will include 
same day predose and 2 -hour (±15  minutes) postdose readings, pair ed with PK timepoints 
(Table  4) as specified in the Schedule of Assessments.   
Similarly, in all patients receiving >2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1, it is required t hat ECGs will be 
obtained on at least 2 separate clinic visits (D1, and Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or 18) , each of which 
will include same day predose and 4 -hour (±20  minutes) postdose readings, paired with PK 
timepoints ( Table  4), as specified in the Schedule of Assessments.  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for reviewing the  ECGs to assess whether the results 
have changed since the Screening/ Baseline visit and to determine the clinical relevance  of the 
results.  These assessments will be recorded on the eCRF.  For any clinically relevant ECG 
changes from the Screening/Baseline visit (eg, ischemic ECG changes, wave/interval changes, or 
arrhythmia) , the Investigator must contact the Medical Monitor to discuss continued participation 
of the patient in the study . 
7.5.5.  Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory.   
On dosing days up to th e Month 18 visit, results from hematology, chemistry, and coagulation 
tests collected within the prior 14 days must be reviewed by the Investigator before study drug 
administration.  These results can be analyzed centrally or at a local laboratory.  If res ults from 
within the prior 14 days are not available at a dosing visit (at visits from D1 to Month 18), 
locally analyzed assessments must be reviewed to allow same day study drug administration  and 
additional samples for central analysis must  also be colle cted.  On dosing days from Month 19 
through Month 48, a review of laboratory results within 14 days is not required.  
In the event of an unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study 
drug administration, the test should be r epeated and followed up at the discretion of the 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 8, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  46 
  Investigator until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis is made to 
adequately explain the abnormality.  
At any point during the study, and based on Investigator judgment, if a  patient experiences 
uncharacteristic signs and symptoms during a porphyria attack, lipase testing should be 
performed and imaging evaluations (eg, right upper quadrant ultrasound and/or other testing, 
based on Investigator judgment) should be considered b y the Investigator.  Signs and symptoms 
include, but are not limited to, uncharacteristic abdominal pain and worsening nausea and 
vomiting.  
Imaging is required for any serum lipase result of ≥3× the upper limit of normal, or as clinically 
indicated.

  7.5.5.1.  Immunogenicity  
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate antidrug antibodies.  On days when ALN -AS1 is 
administered, blood samples for antidrug antibody testing must be collected before ALN -AS1 is  
administered.  
Sample collection for patients who experience a potential anaphylactic reaction is discussed in 
Section  6.2.3.2.1 . 
Details regarding the processing, shipping, and analysis of the samples will be provided in the 
Laboratory Manual.  
7.5.5.2.  Pregnancy Testing  
A pregnancy test will be performed for WOCBP only.  A serum pregnancy test will be 
performed at Screening/Baseline and urine pregnancy tests will be performed thereafter per the 
Schedule of Assessments and any time pregnancy is suspected.  Urine pregnancy tests may also 
be perform ed more frequently (eg, monthly) based on local country requirements.  The results of 
the pregnancy test must be known before study drug administration.  Patients who are pregnant 
are not eligible for study participation.  Any woman with a positive pregnan cy test during the 
study will be discontinued from study drug, but will continue to be followed for safety.  Patients 
determined to be pregnant while on study will be followed until the pregnancy outcome is known 
(see Section  7.5.6.6 for follow -up instructions).  
7.5.6.  Adverse Events  
7.5.6.1.  Definitions  
Adverse Event  
According to the ICH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 21 
Code of  Federal Regulations 312.32, Investigational New Drug Safety Reporting, an AE is any 
untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational subject administered a 
medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship wit h this treatment.  
Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (An event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred.  It does not include an ev ent that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above (eg, 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 8, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  49 
  events inclu de allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug 
dependency or abuse).  
Adverse Event Severity  
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detai led below:  
Mild:  Mild events are those which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal 
daily activity.  
Moderate:  Moderate events are those which cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with 
normal daily activities.  
Severe:  Severe events are those which incapacitate and prevent usual activity.  
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity.  AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of the  start and stop of each incidence.  When changes in the severity of an AE 
occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day should 
be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes s hould be 
recorded separately (with distinct onset dates)  
AE severity and seriousness are assessed independently.  ‘Severity’ characterizes the intensity of 
an AE.  ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining 
regul atory reporting obligations (see definition for Serious Adverse Event).  
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Treatment  
The relationship of each AE to study treatment should be evaluated by the Investigator using the 
following criteria:  
Definitely re lated:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to the medication administration, and which 
cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
The response to withdrawal of the  drug should be clinically plausible.  
Possibly related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to the medication administration, but which 
could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals.  Information on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or 
unclear.  
Unlikely related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no 
temporal relationship to medication administration, and which other 
drugs, chemicals, or u nderlying disease provide plausible explanations.  
Not related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality that has no 
temporal relationship to the medication or has more likely alternative 
etiology.

Amendment 8, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  50 
  Adverse Events of Clinical Interest  
The fo llowing events are considered to be adverse events of clinical interest:  
• ISRs  
• Hepatic AEs, including LFT abnormalities considered clinically significant by the 
Investigator . 
• Lipase >3×ULN (or >3× the baseline lipase measurement if baseline is >ULN)  
• Anaphyl actic Reactions. Anaphylactic reaction is a severe, potentially fatal, systemic 
allergic reaction with acute onset (minutes to hours).  Symptoms of an anaphylactic 
reaction  may include skin or mucosal tissue (e.g. generalized hives, pruritus, 
angioedema), respiratory compromise (e.g. wheezing, bronchospasm, hypoxia), 
reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (e.g. syncope, hypotonia).  See 
Section  11.3 (Table  8) for guidance on diagnosing anaphylactic reactions. (36) 
7.5.6.2.  Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
The patient should be asked about  medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last 
visit.  The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospitalized, had any accidents, used 
any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC).  
In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant 
laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are 
relevant to patient safety.  
Recording Adverse Events  
The Investigator is respo nsible for recording non -serious AEs that are observed or reported by 
the patient after administration of the first dose of study drug regardless of their relationship to 
study drug through the end of study.  Non -serious AEs will be followed until the end of study.  
The Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by the patient 
after the time when the informed consent is signed regardless of their relationship to study drug 
through the end of study.  SAEs will be followed un til satisfactory resolution, until baseline level 
is reached, or until the SAE is considered by the Investigator to be chronic or the patient is 
stable, as appropriate.  
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the  eCRF for 
the patient, whether or not they are considered to be drug -related.  Each AE must be described in 
detail:  onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to investigational drug, 
action taken, and outcome (including time and da te of resolution, if applicable).  
For SAEs, record the event(s) on the eCRF.  If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is 
unavailable, complete the backup SAE form.  
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest, the Sponsor or its designee should  be 
notified within 24 hours using a supplemental AEs of clinical interest (AECI) eCRF.  Additional 
clinical and laboratory information may be collected based upon the severity or nature of the 
event.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 8, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  51 
  If a patient has ISRs meeting any of the following crit eria, the Investigator or delegate should 
contact the Medical Monitor and submit a supplemental ISR eCRF:  
• ISRs that are recurrent and/or demonstrate a pattern of increasing severity  
• Any ISR that is determined to be severe and/or a cause for study drug disc ontinuation  
• Any ISR which, in the opinion of the Investigator, requires further medical evaluation 
or treatment  
In some cases, where it is medically appropriate, further evaluation may include photographs, 
referral to a dermatologist, skin biopsy, or othe r laboratory testing.  If a biopsy was obtained, the 
Sponsor may request that the biopsy also be reviewed by a central dermatopathologist.  To better 
understand the safety profile of the study drug, additional analysis of biopsy tissue may be 
performed acc ording to local regulations.  
For patients with hepatic AEs, additional information, including, clinical history, course of event, 
and local laboratory results to monitor LFT levels or other laboratory parameters, may be 
collected.  
7.5.6.3.  Serious Adverse Events Re quire Immediate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee  
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by the Investigator.  Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section  7.5.6.1  must be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee within 24 hours from the time that clinical study center personnel first 
learns of the event.  All SAEs must be reported regardless of the relationship to study drug.  
The initial report should include at least the following information:  
• Patient’s study number  
• Description and date of onset of the event  
• Criterion for serious  
• Preliminary assignment of relationship to study drug  
• Investigator/clinical study cente r information  
To report the SAE, complete the eCRF.  If the EDC system is unavailable, complete the backup 
SAE form.  Within 24 hours of receipt of follow -up information, the Investigator must update the 
report.  SAEs must be reported using the contact inf ormation provided in the Study Manual.  
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken by the Investigator using his/her best medical 
judgment to treat the SAE.  These measures and the patient’s response to these measures should 
be recorded.  All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be followed by the 
Investigator until satisfactory resolution or the Investigator deems the SAE to be chronic or 
stable.  Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed by the Investigator as  
needed to adequately determine the etiology of the event.  
7.5.6.4.  Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities  
The Sponsor or its representative is required to report certain study events in an expedited 
manner to the Food and Drug Administration, the Europ ean Medicines Agency’s EudraVigilance 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  52 
  electronic system according to Directive 2001/20/EC, and to all country Regulatory Authorities 
where the study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations.  
The following describes the safety reporting  timeline requirements for suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) and other reportable events:  
Immediately and within 7 calendar days  
• Any suspected adverse reaction that is associated with the use of the study drug, 
unexpected, and fatal o r life threatening.  Follow -up information must be reported in 
the following 8 days.  
Immediately and within 15 calendar days  
• Any suspected adverse reaction that is associated with the use of the study drug, 
unexpected, and serious, but not fatal or life th reatening, and there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the reaction.  
• Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggest a significant risk for human 
patients including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or  carcinogenicity.  
• Any event in connection with the conduct of the study or the development of the 
study drug that may affect the safety of the trial patients.  
In addition, periodic safety reporting to regulatory authorities will be performed by the Sponsor  
or its representative according to national and local regulations.  
7.5.6.5.  Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
SUSARs will be reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics 
Committ ee (IEC) per their institutional policy by the Investigator or Sponsor (or Sponsor 
designee) according to country requirements.  Copies of each report and documentation of 
IRB/IEC notification and acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator ’s study 
file. 
7.5.6.6.  Pregnancy Reporting  
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the course of this study through 90 days following 
the last dose of study drug, the Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee 
within 24 hours of being no tified of the pregnancy.  Details of the pregnancy will be recorded on 
the pregnancy reporting form.  The patient should receive any necessary counseling regarding 
the risks of continuing the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  
The pregnancy s hould be followed by the Investigator until completion.  At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy.  If the outcome of the 
pregnancy results in a postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirt h, neonatal death, 
or congenital anomaly, then the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE 
as outlined in Section  7.5.6.3 .

Amendment 8, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  53 
  7.5.6.7.  Overdose Reporting  
An overdose is defined as any dose administered to or taken by a patient (accidentally or 
intentionally) that exceeds the highest daily dose, or is at a higher frequency, than included in the 
protocol.  It is up to the investigator to de cide whether a dose is to be considered an overdose, in 
consultation with the Sponsor.  Overdose must be recorded in the eCRF.  
All reports of overdose (with or without an AE) must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor 
or designee.   
7.6. Exploratory Assess ments  
Blood and urine samples will be collected for exploratory analyses.  Aliquots of samples will be 
obtained and frozen, to permit future analysis of the effect of ALN -AS1 on exploratory 
biomarkers.  Samples may also be used for testing homocysteine levels.  
Where local regulations allow, biologic samples will be retained on behalf of the Sponsor for a 
maximum of 15 years following the last patient’s last visit in the study.  Details regarding the 
collection, processing, storage, and shipping of sample s will be in the Laboratory Manual.  
7.7. Other Assessments  
7.7.1.  EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire  
QOL will be assessed through the use of the 5 -level EQ -5D (EQ -5D-5L), a standardized 
questionnaire measuring health outcomes. (39)  In addition to the time points indicated, the 
EQ-5D-5L questionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a 
porphyria attack (but, not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible.  
7.8. COVID -19 Data Collection  
Information on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) infection status of the patient, if 
known, and other information on the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on the patient's 
participation in the study will be collected.  
8. STATISTICS

Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 8, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  56 
  9. STUDY ADMINISTRATION  
9.1. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, all applicable regulatory 
requirements, and the guidelines of Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  Compliance with GCP 
provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and well -being of study patients are protected 
consistent with the principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
9.1.1.  Informed Consent  
The Investigator will ensure that the patient is given full and adequate oral and written 
information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study.  Patients must also 
be notified that they are free to withdraw from the study at any tim e.  The patient should be given 
the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided.  
The patient’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study 
procedures.  
The Investigator must maintain the original, signed ICF.  A copy of the signed ICF must be 
given to the patient.  
The Investigator will inform the patient/legal guardian if new information becomes available that 
may be relevant to the patient’s/legal guardian’s willingness to continue pa rticipation in the 
study.  Communication of this information should be documented.  
9.1.2.  Ethical Review  
The final study protocol, including the final version of the ICF, must be approved or given a 
favorable opinion in writing by an IRB or IEC, as appropriate.  The Investigator must submit 
written approval before he or she can enroll any patient into the study.  
The Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB or IEC of any amendment to the protocol 
in accordance with local requirements.  In addition, the IRB  or IEC must approve all patient 
materials for the study (except those that support the need to remove an apparent immediate 
hazard to the patient).  The protocol must be reapproved by the IRB or IEC upon receipt of 
amendments and annually, as local regula tions require.  
Initial IRB approval of the protocol, and all materials approved by the IRB for this study 
including the patient consent form and recruitment materials must be maintained by the 
Investigator and made available for inspection.  
The Investigato r will submit reports of SAEs as outlined in Section  7.5.6 .  In addition, the 
Investigator agrees to submit progress reports to the IRB or IEC per t heir local reporting 
requirements, or at least annually and at the conclusion of the study.  The reports will be made 
available to the Sponsor or designee.  
Any communications from regulatory agencies in regard to inspections, other studies that impact 
this protocol or the qualifications of study personnel should be promptly reported to the Sponsor 
or its designee.  
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 8, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  57 
  The Investigator is also responsible for providing the IRB with reports of any reportable serious 
adverse drug reactions from any other study con ducted with the investigational drug.  The 
Sponsor or designee will provide this information to the Investigator.  
Major changes in this research activity, except those to remove an apparent immediate hazard to 
the patient, must be reviewed and approved by the Sponsor and the IRB or IEC that approved the 
study.  Amendments to the protocol must be submitted in writing to the Investigator’s IRB or 
IEC and the Regulatory Authority for approval before patients are enrolled under the amended 
protocol.  
9.1.3.  Serious Bre ach of Protocol  
Investigators must notify the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of becoming aware of a potential 
serious breach of the protocol.  A serious breach is a breach that is likely to affect to a significant 
degree the safety and rights of a study p articipant or the reliability and robustness of the data 
generated in the clinical trial.  
9.1.4.  Study Documentation, Confidentiality, and Records Retention  
All documentation relating to the study should be retained for the period of time required by 
applicable l ocal law.  If it becomes necessary for the Sponsor, the Sponsor’s designee, applicable 
IRB/IEC, or applicable regulatory authorities to review or audit any documentation relating to 
the study, the Investigator must permit direct access to all source docume nts/data.  Records will 
not be destroyed without informing the Sponsor in writing and giving the Sponsor the 
opportunity to store the records for a longer period of time at the Sponsor’s expense.   
The Investigator must ensure that the patients’ confidenti ality will be maintained.  On the CRFs 
or other documents submitted to the Sponsor or designees, patients should not be identified by 
their names, but by the assigned patient number and initials.  If patient names are included on 
copies of documents submit ted to the Sponsor or designees, the names (except for initials) will 
be obliterated and the assigned patient number added to the document.  Documents not for 
submission to the Sponsor (eg, signed ICFs) should be maintained by the Investigator in strict 
confidence.  
The Investigator must treat all of the information related to the study and the compiled data as 
confidential, whose use is for the purpose of conducting the study.  The Sponsor must approve 
any transfer of information not directly involved in th e study.  
In compliance with local and/or regional regulations, this clinical study may be registered and 
study results may be posted on public registries, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.  
9.1.5.  End of the Study  
The end of the study is defined as last patient last vis it. 
9.1.6.  Discontinuation of the Clinical Study  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study for clinical or administrative reasons at 
any time.  If the clinical study center does not recruit at a reasonable rate, the study may be 
discontinued at that  clinical study center.  Should the study be terminated and/or the clinical 
study center closed for whatever reason, all documentation and study drug pertaining to the study 
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 8, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  58 
  must be returned to the Sponsor or its representative, and the Investigators, IEC/ IRB and 
Regulatory Authorities will be promptly informed of the termination and the reason for the 
decision.  The Investigator should promptly inform the patients and assure appropriate therapy 
and follow -up.  Patients should then be withdrawn from the stu dy.   
9.2. Data Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
9.2.1.  Data Handling  
Study data must be recorded on case report forms (paper and/or electronic) provided by the 
Sponsor or designee on behalf of the Sponsor.  Case report forms must be completed only by 
persons des ignated by the Investigator.  If eCRFs are used, study data must be entered by trained 
clinical study center personnel with access to a valid and secure eCRF system.  All data entered 
into the eCRF must also be available in the source documents.  Correctio ns on paper CRFs must 
be made so as to not obliterate the original data and must be initialed and dated by the person 
who made the correction.  
9.2.2.  Study Monitoring  
The clinical monitor, as a representative of the Sponsor, has an obligation to closely follow th e 
study conduct at the clinical study center.  The monitor will visit the Investigator and clinical 
study center periodically and will maintain frequent telephone and written contact.  The monitor 
will maintain current personal knowledge of the study throu gh observation, review of study 
records and source documentation, and discussion of the conduct of the study with the 
Investigator and personnel.  
The monitor will review source documents, systems and CRFs to ensure overall quality and 
completeness of the d ata and to confirm study procedures are complied with the requirements in 
the study protocol.  The Sponsor, or its designee, will be allowed to conduct clinical study center 
visits to the investigation facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of  the study.  The 
Investigator agrees to allow the monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug 
accountability records, patient charts and study source documents, and other records relative to 
study conduct.  
9.2.3.  Audits and Inspections  
Periodically, the Sponsor or its authorized representatives audit clinical investigative study 
centers as an independent review of core trial processes and documents to determine whether 
these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, an d accurately reported 
according to the protocol, GCP guidelines of the ICH, and any applicable regulatory 
requirements.  A regulatory authority, an IEC or an IRB may visit the clinical study center to 
perform audits or inspections, including source data ve rification.  The Investigator should contact 
the Sponsor, or its designee, immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency about an 
inspection.  
9.3. Publication Policy  
It is intended that after completion of the study, the data are to be submitted for publicati on in a 
scientific journal and/or for reporting at a scientific meeting.  A copy of any proposed manuscript 
must be provided and confirmed received at the Sponsor at least 30 days before its submission, 
and according to any additional publication details i n the Investigator Agreement.

Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 8, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  65 
 a Patients are not required to complete Screening/Baseline assessments if the assessments in the previous study (ALN -AS1-001) were completed within 60 days 
of administration of the first dose of ALN -AS1 in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed s ince the last assessment, clinical laboratory tests and ECGs 
will be repeated before administration of ALN -AS1.  Results should be available and deemed acceptable before the administration of the first dose of ALN -
AS1.  
b After a patient has completed 6 mon ths of ALN -AS1 administration in this study, and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, 
study procedures, including ALN -AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional.  Study procedur es may occur at the 
patient’s home at the discretion of the Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to com plete at least 1 visit at the clinical 
study center Q3M through M12, and thereafter Q6M. Additional visits to c ollect clinical laboratory samples may occur at home at any point during the 
treatment period, within 14 days prior to scheduled dose administration.  
c See Section  7.1 for details on the interval medical history/disease history to be recorded at Screening/Baseline.  Ongoing AEs from the previ ous study 
(ALN -AS1-001) will be captured as medical history.  
d A complete physical examination will be performed  at Screening/Baseline, and D1.  At all other visits, a targeted physical examination will be performed.  On 
dosing days, the physical examination will be performed predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, the physical examination can occur at a ny time 
during the visit.  See Section  7.5.3  for details on the physical examination.  
e Height will be measured at Screening/Baseline only.  
f Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate.  On D1, vital signs will be collected withi n 1 hour predose; and 2 hours 
(±10 minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predos e.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, vital signs 
can be collected at any time during the visit.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be cons istent for each patient), after the 
patient has rested comfortably for 10  minutes.  
g Using central ECG equipment, triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine position after the patient has rested comfortably for at least 5 
minutes.  For patients receiving ≤2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1 ECGs will be performed within 1 hour predose and 2 hours (±15 minutes) postdose at a minimum of 2 
of the following visits:  D1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 15 (only if visit is done at clinic), or Month 18.  In patients receiving >2.5 mg/kg 
ALN -AS1, ECGs will be performed within 1 hour predose and 4 hours (±20 minutes) postdose at a minimum of two of the following visits:  D1, Month 3, 
Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 15 (only if visit is done at clinic), or Month 18.  On all other dosing days, ECGs will be collected withi n 1 hour predose 
(see Section  7.5.4   for ECG assessment details).  
h Clinical laboratory parameters are described in Section  7.5.5 .  On dosing days, blood samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected predose.  On 
days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, blood samples can be collecte d at any time during the visit. On dosing days up to the Month 18 visit,results from 
hematology, chemistry (including LFTs), and coagulation tests collected within the prior 14 days must be reviewed by the Inve stigator before study drug 
administration.  If  results from within the prior 14 days are not available at a dosing visit (at visits from D1 to Month 18), locally analyzed p redose assessments 
may be used for review in order to allow same day study drug administration, and additional samples for central  analysis must also be collected.  
i A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening/Baseline; thereafter, urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  Results  must be available before dosing.  
j ALN -AS1 will be administered by SC injection according to the Pharmacy Manual.  See Section  6.2.2  for ALN -AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  For weight -
based dosing, weight measured at the current study center vi sit (dosing day) will be used to calculate the dose of ALN -AS1.  After M12, weight measured at 
either the previous study center visit or on current study center visit will be used to calculate the weight -based dose of ALN -AS1.  
k Spot urine samples will be collected for measurement of ALA, PBG, and creatinine levels.  On dosing days, samples should be collected predose.  
l On dosing days, blood and urine samples for ALAS1 mRNA (and possible biomarker) analysis will be collected within 1 hour pred ose. 
m Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points listed in Table  4 (Appendix Section  11.1).  Blood sample collection for PK analysis at 
Month 9 and Mon th 15 is only necessary if ECG will be performed at same visit.  
n On dosing days, blood samples for antidrug antibody analysis should be collected within 1 hour predose.

 o Porphyria attack laboratory sample collection kits should be dispensed at the screen ing visit along with instructions for use. For any attack that occurs through 
M37, urine samples should be collected within 24 hours of the start of clinical intervention (eg, hemin or glucose administra tion) and within 24 hours of the end 
of clinical inte rvention.  If patients are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laboratory sample collect ion kits should be used 
for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center, if possible.  These urine samples ma y also be analyzed for exploratory biomarkers.  
p In addition to the time points indicated, the EQ -5D-5L questionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a porphyria attack 
(but not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible.  
q Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain assessments, and narcotic use on  a daily basis through M9; 
thereafter, acute porphyria attacks will be recorded in the diary.  The BPI will be complet ed on a weekly basis as part of the patient diary through M9, then 
Q3M.  
r Medications that are ongoing from the previous study (ALN -AS1-001), started between the previous study and this study, and started after signing informed 
consent in this study, will be captured as concomitant medication(s).

SUMMARY OF CHANGES D ATED 29 MARCH 2021  
A Multicenter, Open -label Extension Study to Evaluate the Long -term Safety and Clinical 
Activity of Subcutaneously Administered ALN -AS1 in Patients with Acute Intermittent 
Porphyria who have Completed a Previous Clinical Study with ALN -AS1 
1. RATIONALE FOR PROTOC OL AMENDMENT  
The purpose of this protocol amendment is to recommend testing of blood homocystein e levels.  
In addition , it is recommended that patients with increased blood homocysteine levels receive a 
supplement containing vitamin B6.  
 
These recommendations are being made because during ALN -AS1 treatment, increases in blood 
homocysteine levels have  been observed compared to levels before ALN -AS1 treatment.  Thus, 
monitoring for changes in blood homocysteine  levels during treatment with ALN -AS1 has been 
incorporated into the protocol .  Blood homocysteine levels may also be increased in patients with 
acute hepatic porphyria (AHP), vitamin deficiencies, or chronic kidney disease.  The clinical 
relevance of the elevations in blood homocysteine during ALN -AS1 treatment is unknown .  
Detailed reasons for each change are provided in Section  2.  Corrections to typographical errors, 
punctuation, grammar, abbreviations, and formatting are not detailed.

Amendment 8 Summary of Changes, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  2 2. PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 8  DETAILED SUMMARY OF  CHANGES  
The primary section(s) of the protocol affected by the changes in Protocol Amendment 8 are  indicated.  The corresponding text has 
been revised throughout the protocol.  Deleted text is indicated by strikeout  and added text is indicated by bold  font, relevant to each 
purpose described.  
Purpose:  Add measuring blood homocysteine levels as part of  the exploratory biomarker assessment.  
The primary change occurs in Section 7.6 Exploratory Biomarkers  
Revised text:  (in the first paragraph)  
Blood and urine samples will be collected for exploratory analyses.  Aliquots of samples will be obtained and fr ozen, to permit future 
analysis of the effect of ALN -AS1 on exploratory biomarkers.  Samples may also be used for testing homocysteine levels.    
Section(s) also reflecting this change:  
• Table 3, Schedule of Assessments:  Month 37 through End of Study (Every 3 Months Dosing Regimen) (footnote l)  
• Table 7, Schedule of Assessments:  Month 37 through End of Study (Every 3 Months Dosing Regimen) (footnote l)  
Purpose:  To add increases in blood homocysteine levels to the benefit -risk assessment, noting the un known clinical relevance, and to 
inform the Investigator about the possibility to supplement with vitamin B6 should increases in homocysteine levels occur.  
The primary change occurs in Section 1.7 Benefit -Risk Assessment  
Added text:  (added 4th bullet poi nt) 
The important potential risks associated with administration of ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP are as follows:  
• Homocysteine elevations:  Blood homocysteine levels may be increased in patients with AHP, vitamin deficiencies, 
or chronic kidney disease .(33-35)  During treatment with ALN -AS1, increases in blood homocysteine levels have 
been observed compared to levels before treatment.  The clinical relevance of the elevations in blood homocysteine 
during ALN -AS1 treatment is unknown.  The protocol includes m onitoring for changes in blood homocysteine 
levels during treatment with ALN -AS1.  Vitamin B6 supplementation is recommended for patients with elevated 
homocysteine levels  (see Section 6.3).

Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 8 Summary of Changes, 29 March 2021  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  3 Purpose:  To add that vitamin B6 supplementation is an accepted  potential concomitant medication if increases in blood homocysteine 
levels are observed.  
The changes include the revisions to Section 6.3 Concomitant Medications  
Added text: (3rd paragraph)  
During treatment with ALN -AS1, blood homocysteine levels may show an increase compared to levels before treatment.  
Blood homocysteine levels will be assessed as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (see Table 3 or Table 7).  It is 
recommended that pat ients with increased blood homocysteine levels receive a supplement containing Vitamin B6.   All 
vitamin supplements should be recorded on the concomitant medications eCRF.

Study Design  
This is a multicenter, open -label extension study to evaluate the long -term safety and clinical activity 
of ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP who completed study AL N-AS1-001. 
The last assessments performed, determining previous study (ALN -AS1-001) completion, will serve as 
the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed since the last 
assessment, safety assessments will be repeate d before administration of ALN -AS1.  It is anticipated 
that patients will begin ALN -AS1 administration in this study within 6 months after the last dose of 
study drug in the previous study.  Eligibility will be confirmed before administration of the first dose of 
ALN -AS1 (Day 1).  Patients will undergo assessments at the clinical study center every month for the 
first 3 months.  Then, through Month 6, and according to the dosing regimen selected, assessments will 
take place at the clinical study center or v ia a phone contact (for an every month dosing regimen, visits 
will be every month; for an every 3 months dosing regimen, visits will be every 3 months).  After a 
patient has completed 12 months of ALN -AS1 administration in this study (6 months in an every 
month dosing regimen), and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, 
study procedures, including ALN -AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s home by a 
healthcare professional.  If the patient is unable to come to the study site, and a visit by a home 
healthcare professional is not possible due to circumstances related to the COVID -19 pandemic, ALN -
AS1 may be administered by the patient or the caregiver under the oversight of the Investigator, and 
following consulta tion with the medical monitor, as allowed by applicable country and local 
regulations.  Study procedures may occur at the patient’s home at the discretion of the Investigator, 
based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical 
study center every 3 months for the first year, and thereafter every 6 months through the end of the 
treatment period.  Additional visits to collect clinical laboratory samples may occur at home at any 
point during the treatme nt period, within 14 days prior to scheduled dose administration.  Patients will 
return to the clinical study center for a posttreatment follow -up visit after administration of the last 
dose of ALN -AS1.  An ALA/PBG Monitoring/EOS visit will be conducted ei ther at the clinical study 
center or via phone contact, unless treatment continues with ALN -AS1.  
Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain assessments, 
and narcotic use.  Patients will also be provided wit h laboratory sample collection kits and instructions 
for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center.  
Patients may receive ALN -AS1 as long as they do not fulfill any of the study discontinuation criteria or 
until ALN -AS1 is commercial ly available in the patient’s territory or the ALN -AS1 development 
program is discontinued (whichever comes first).  
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review safety and tolerability data collected during the study 
with the primary purpose of protecting the safety of patients participating in the study.  
Number of Planned Patients  
Up to 24 patients are planned for enrollment in this study (including optional cohorts in 
ALN -AS1-001).

  Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria  
Patients with AIP, who have comp leted Part C of study ALN -AS1-001, will be eligible for screening in 
this study.  Eligible patients will not be on a scheduled regimen of hemin to prevent porphyria attacks 
at Screening.  Patients with alanine transaminase ≥2.0× upper limit of normal, tota l bilirubin ≥2 mg/dL 
(unless bilirubin elevation is due to Gilbert’s syndrome), or estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤30 
mL/min/1.73 m2 (using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) at Screening are not 
eligible for this study.  
Investigatio nal Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
ALN -AS1 Solution for Injection (subcutaneous use [SC]) is comprised of a synthetic, small interfering 
RNA targeting ALAS1 and bearing a triantennary N -acetyl galactosamine ligand conjugated to the 
sense strand,  formulated in phosphate buffer.  
The study starting dose and regimen of ALN -AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg as an SC injection administered every 3 
months.  Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may approve changes to the dosing regimen, 
including decreases in the dos e level and changes in the dosing frequency.  However any dose and 
dosing regimen will not exceed a previously explored dose level or frequency that was determined to 
be safe and well -tolerated in study ALN -AS1-001, SRC, Health Authority and Ethics Committ ee 
approval must be sought prior to dose escalation above 5.0 mg/kg in accordance with local Regulatory 
requirements.  
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Not applicable  
Duration of Treatment and Study  
The duration of treatment is up to 4 8 months.  The estimated total time on study, inclusive of 
Screening/Baseline, for each patient is up to 56 months.  
Statistical Methods  
Statistical analyses will be primarily descriptive.  Incidence of AEs will be summarized by maximum 
severity and relati onship to ALN -AS1.  Incidence of and serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs 
leading to discontinuation will also be tabulated.  By -patient listings will be provided for deaths, SAEs, 
and events leading to discontinuation.  
Laboratory shift tables from basel ine to worst values will be presented.  Abnormal physical 
examination findings and electrocardiogram data will be presented in by -patient listings.  Descriptive 
statistics will be provided for electrocardiogram interval data and presented as both actual va lues and 
changes from baseline relative to each on study evaluation and to the last evaluation on -study.  
Clinical activity of ALN -AS1 will be summarized primarily by descriptive statistics.  The clinical 
activity of ALN -AS1 will be evaluated by the frequen cy and characteristics of porphyria attacks 
including duration, treatment, and severity of porphyria attacks and number and duration of visits to a 
health care setting for acute porphyria care.  Patient diary recordings, including BPI -SF questionnaire 
scores, will also be summarized.   
PD analysis will include the evaluation of change in ALA, PBG, and ALAS mRNA levels.  Descriptive 
statistics (eg, mean and standard error of the mean) for observed levels of PD parameters and the 
relative change from baseline  will be presented for each of the postdose follow -up time points.  
The PK concentration of ALN -AS1 will be determined.  Antidrug antibody results will be tabulated 
overall and by previous treatment in the previous study (ALN -AS1-001).  A by -patient listing  will also 
be provided.  
Additional exploratory analyses may be conducted on analytes related to targeting the heme 
biosynthesis pathway.  Quality of life scores will also be summarized.

Notes:   
• White boxes represent visits to the clinical study center or when patients will be contacted by phone; grey boxes represent s tudy visit that may be  
conducted while the patient is at home.  
• When scheduled at the same time points, assessments of vital signs and 12 -lead ECGs should be performed first, before the physical examinations 
and blood/urine sample collections.  
a Patients are not required to complete Screening/Baseline assessments if the assessments in the previous study (ALN -AS1-001) were completed within 60 days 
of administration of the first dose of ALN -AS1 in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed since the last assessment, clinica l laboratory tests and ECGs 
will be repeated before administration of ALN -AS1.  Results should be available and deemed acceptable before the administration of the first dose of ALN -
AS1.  On Day 1, results from hematology, chemistry (including LFTs), and co agulation tests collected within the prior 14 days must be reviewed by the 
84

  Investigator before study drug administration.  If results from within the prior 14 days are not available at a dosing visit,  locally analyzed predose assessments 
may be used for re view in order to allow same day study drug administration and additional samples for central analysis must also be collected.  
b After a patient has completed 12 months of ALN -AS1 administration in this study, and where applicable country and local regulati ons and infrastructure allow, 
study procedures, including ALN -AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional.  Study procedures may occur at the 
patient’s home at the discretion of the Investigator, based on safety an d tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical 
study center Q6M.  Additional visits to collect c linical laboratory samples may occur at home at any point during the treatment period, within 14 days prior to 
scheduled dose administration.  
c See Section 7.1 for details on the interval medical history/disease history to be recorded at Screening/Baseline.  Ongoing AE s from the previous study 
(ALN -AS1-001) will be captured as medical history.  
d A complete physical exa mination will be performed at Screening/Baseline, and D1.  At all other visits, a targeted physical examination will be perfo rmed.  On 
dosing days, the physical examination will be performed predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, the physical examination can occur at any time 
during the visit.  See Section  7.5.3  for details on the physical examination.  
e Height will be measured at Screeni ng/Baseline only.  
f Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate.  On D1, vital signs will be collected  within 1 hour predose; and 2 hours 
(±10 minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, vital signs will be coll ected within 1 hour predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, vital signs 
can be collected at any time during the visit.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be cons istent for each patient), after the 
patient has  rested comfortably for at least 10 minutes.  
g Using central ECG equipment, triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine position after the patient has rested comfortably for at least 5 
minutes.  For patients receiving ≤2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1, ECGs will be performed within 1 hour predose and 2 hours (±15 minutes) postdose at a minimum of 2 
of the following visits:  D1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 15 (only if visit is done at clinic), or Month 18.  In patients receiving >2 .5 mg/kg 
ALN -AS1, ECGs will be performed within 1 hour predose and 4 hours (±20 minutes) postdose at a minimum of two of the following vis its:  D1, Month 3, 
Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 15 (only if visit is done at clinic), or Month 18.  On all other dosing days, ECGs will be collected within 1 hour predose 
(see Section  7.5.4  for ECG assessment details).   
h Clinical laboratory parameters are des cribed in Section  7.5.5 .  On dosing days, blood samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected predose.  On 
days when ALN -AS1 is not a dministered, blood samples can be collected at any time during the visit. On dosing days, results from hematology, chemistry 
(including LFTs), and coagulation tests collected within the prior 14 days must be reviewed by the Investigator before study drug a dministration.  If results 
from within the prior 14 days are not available at a dosing visit, locally analyzed predose assessments may be used for revie w in order to allow same day study 
drug administration  and additional samples for central analysis  must   also be collected.  
i A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening/Baseline; thereafter, urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  Results  must be available before dosing.  
j ALN -AS1 will be administered by SC injection according to the Pharmacy M anual.  See Section  6.2.2  for ALN -AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  For 
weight -based dosing, weight measured at the current study center visit (dosing da y) will be used to calculate the dose of ALN -AS1 through M12.  After M12, 
weight measured at either the previous study center visit or the current study center visit may be used to calculate the weig ht-based dose of ALN -AS1.  
k Spot urine samples will be co llected for measurement of ALA, PBG, and creatinine levels.  On dosing days, samples should be collected predose.  
l On dosing days, blood and urine samples for ALAS1 mRNA (and possible biomarker) analysis will be collected within 1 hour pred ose. 
m Blood sa mples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points listed in Table  4 (Appendix Section  11.1).  Blood sample collection for PK analysis at 
Month 9 and Month 15 is only necessary if ECG will be performed at same visit.  
n On dosing days, blood samples for antidrug antibody analysis should be collected within 1 hour predose.  
o Porphyria attack laboratory sample collection kits should be dispensed at the screening visit along with instructions for use . For any attack that occurs through 
M37, urine samples should be collected within 24 hours of t he start of clinical intervention (eg, hemin or glucose administration) and within 24 hours of the end 
of clinical intervention.  If patients are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laborator y sample collection kits wil l be provided

  that contain instructions for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center, if possible.  These urine sa mples may also be analyzed for 
exploratory biomarkers.  
p In addition to the time points indicated, the EQ -5D-5L quest ionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a porphyria attack 
(but not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible.  
q Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain ass essments, and narcotic use on a daily basis through M9; 
thereafter, acute porphyria attacks will be recorded in the diary.  The BPI will be completed on a weekly basis as part of th e patient diary through M9, then 
Q3M.  
r Patients will be contacted by phone  to collect AEs and concomitant medications.  Patients will also be reminded to collect and send urine samples to the clinical  
study center, if possible, if they are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack.  
s Medications that are ongoing from the previous study (ALN -AS1-001), started between the previous study and this study, and started after signing informed 
consent in this study, will be captured as concomitant medication(s).

Notes:   
• White boxes represent visits  to the clinical study center or when patients will be contacted by phone; grey boxes represent study visit that may be 
conducted while the patient is at home.  
• When scheduled at the same time points, assessments of vital signs and 12 -lead ECGs should be pe rformed first, before the physical examinations 
and blood/urine sample collections.  
a Where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, study procedures, including ALN -AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s 
home by a healthcare professional.  Study procedures may occur at the patient’s home at the discret ion of the Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; 
however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical study center Q6M.  
b Patients who complete all scheduled treatment with ALN -AS1 through Month 48 will return for an end o f study (EOS) visit at Month 49.  Patients who 
discontinue treatment will be asked to complete an early termination (ET) visit at which all Month 37 visit procedures will b e performed; the patient must also 
return for a safety -follow -up visit at 3 months ( 84 [+7] days) after his/her last dose of ALN -AS1.   
c The safety follow -up visit is only required for patients who discontinue prior to study completion.  The visit should be conducted  3 months (8 4 [+7 days]) 
following the last dose of ALN -AS1.  
d A comple te physical examination will be performed at the posttreatment follow -up visit.  At all other visits, a targeted physical examination will be performed.  
On dosing days, the physical examination will be performed predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not admin istered, the physical examination can occur at any 
time during the visit.  See Section  7.5.3  for details on the physical examination.

  1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Disease Overview  
The porphyrias are a family of rare metabolic disorders predominately caused by a genetic 
mutation in 1 of the 8 enzymes responsible for heme synthesis. (1)  The 2 major categories are 
erythropoietic and hepatic, depending on the major site of expression of the under lying enzyme 
deficiency .(2)  In addition, the porphyrias are classified as acute if patients present with 
neurovisceral symptoms (eg, abdominal pain and neurologic symptoms) or cutaneous if they 
present with dermal blistering or photosensitivity. (3, 4) 
This study will include patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), the most common acute 
hepatic porphyria (AHP).  AIP occurs as a result of an autosomal dominant mutation leading to 
partial deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminas e (PBGD), the third enzyme in the heme 
biosynthesis pathway .(5)  The rate limiting step in heme synthesis is the upstre am enzyme 
5-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1), which is controlled by feedback repression via the 
end-product heme.  In response to a decrease in endogenous heme in the liver, as can occur with 
fasting, hormonal alterations, or with cytochrome P450 (C YP) inducing drugs, ALAS1 is 
induced, resulting in increased flux through the heme synthesis pathway.  In patients with AIP, 
this can result in the marked accumulation of the toxic heme intermediates porphobilinogen 
(PBG) and delta aminolevulinic acid (ALA ) in the blood and urine due to the deficiency in the 
downstream PBGD.  Clinically, this manifests as acute attacks characterized by severe 
abdominal pain, cardiovascular as well as neurologic and psychiatric dysfunction. (6) 
1.1.1.  Epidemiology  
Over 370 mutations have been identified in the PBGD gene, which in most instances result in its 
reduction by approximately 50%.  The exact prevalence of AIP is unknown due to under 
diagnosis, variation by geographic region, and the differences in penetrance observed for the 
different mutations .(2)  However, it is estimated that the prevalence of AIP is 5 to 10 per 100,000 
people in Western countries, while in Sweden it occurs in 1 in 1,000 people due to a founder 
effect associated with the resultant G593A mutation .(7-10)  AIP shows incomplete penetrance 
and on average only 10% to 50% of carriers with a mutation present with clinical symptoms. (11)  
It has been proposed that unknown inherited co -factors, in addition to PBGD mutations, may 
explain why a small percentage of patients present with much more severe disease while the 
majority remain asymptomatic.  
Patients with AIP present with acute attacks characterized by neurovisceral symptoms and signs 
including severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or less commonly diarrhea, 
hypertension, tachycardia, fever, muscle weakness, as well as neurological (eg, neuropathy, 
seizures) and psychiat ric (eg, anxiety and confusion) manifestations .(12)  AIP attacks typically 
start after puberty and can be triggered by e xogenous factors such as medications (especially 
barbiturates, sulfonamides, and hydantoins), stress, exogenous hormones, nutritional status, and 
infection.  Clinically active disease is more common in women, where attacks often occur around 
the menstrual cycle and are likely precipitated by hormonal changes.  
Many AIP patients remain undiagnosed given that the disease is rare and characterized by 
non-specific symptoms (eg, abdominal pain and nausea). (2)  The initial diagnosis involves 
demonstrating elevated urinary PBG (typically 20 -50 × normal reference range) and ALA 
100
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 7, 29 April 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  25 
  (typically 5 -20 × normal reference range) when the patient is having acute attack symptoms.  
Once a test is positive for el evated ALA and PBG and porphyria is suspected, genetic testing for 
a PBGD mutation is performed.   
There are 4 main clinical phenotypes of AIP.  Latent gene carriers have never had an acute attack 
and are biochemically inactive (normal urinary ALA and PBG) .  Asymptomatic high excreters 
(ASHE) do not have current acute attacks, but are biochemically active (increased urinary ALA 
and PBG).  The increased levels of ALA and PBG in ASHE patients are lower than those in AIP 
patients during an acute attack, but ar e still significantly higher than normal reference values. (6-
8)  Sporadic attack patients have infrequent acute attacks.  Recurrent attack patients have ≥4 
attacks per year requiring hospitalization or treatm ent by a medical professional. (7) 
1.1.2.  Current Management and Unmet Medical Need  
Management of acute attacks often requires hospitalization.  Patients are initially treated with 
supportive care and carbohydrate loading, analgesics and anti -emetics, and removal of known 
precipitating factors. (13)  In patients with moderate to severe attacks, or who fail to respond to 
supportive measures, treatment with intravenous (IV) hemin (daily for 3 -5 days) is commenced.  
Symptoms typically begin to improve after 2 to 5 days of hemin treatment, accompanied by  a 
lowering of urinary ALA and PBG levels to below or at the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
reference value; however, in some patients attacks can last several weeks, requiring prolonged 
hemin use and hospitalization. (14)  With prolonged and severe attacks, cranial nerve  
involvement can occur, leading to bulbar paralysis, respiratory failure, and death .(15) 
Hemin, a blood derived therapy, was approved as Normosang® (heme arginate) in the European 
Union (EU) and as Panhematin® (lyophilised hematin) in the United States (US) in 1999 and 
1983, respectively. (16, 17)  In the EU, heme arginate is indicated for the treatment of acute 
attacks of hepatic porphyria (eg, AIP, var iegate porphyria, and hereditary coproporphyria); 
whereas, in the US lyophilized hemin is limited to the amelioration of recurrent attacks of AIP 
temporally related to the menstrual cycle.  Approval of both products was based on biochemical 
efficacy (ie, l owering of ALA and PBG) as well as data from uncontrolled case series and case 
reports .(18-22)  Hemin side effects include thrombophlebitis, transient anticoagulation, and in 
rare cases, anaphylaxis or renal failure .(22-24)  In addition, hemin  administration requires a large 
vein for administration, often necessitating central venous access.  
While the majority of patients who experience attacks have them sporadically, it is estimated that 
up to 1,000 AIP patients experience recurrent attacks (t ypically defined as ≥4 per year) in the US 
and EU combined .(25)  While hemin is currently only approved to ameliorate acute attacks, it is 
administered prophylactically in some patients with recurrent attacks (eg, administered every 1 -2 
weeks). (26)  Potential problems associated with chronic hemin administration include infusion 
site phlebitis, iron overload, and the need for chronic IV access and associated complications (eg, 
risk of infection or occlusion). (5)  In addition, there have been reports of a decrease in efficacy 
with chronic hemin administ ration, as evidenced by the need to increase the frequency or dosage 
of hemin prophylaxis over time in attempt to maintain a clinical effect. (27)  In patients with very 
severe recurrent attacks, or in whom hemin treatment is not effective, liver transplantation can be 
curative; however, o rgan transplantation is a high -risk procedure and is rarely used as a treatment 
option .  Given the significant morbidity and mortality, there remains a significant unmet need for 
101
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 7, 29 April 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  26 
  an efficacious, simple, fast -acting and better tolerated treatment for acute or prevent recurrent 
attacks in patients with AIP.  
1.2. RNA Interference  
RNA interference (RNAi) is a naturally occurring cellular mechanism mediated by small 
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for regulating gene expression.  Typically, synthetic siRNAs are 19 
to 25 ba se pair double stranded oligonucleotides in a staggered duplex with a 2 -nucleotide 
overhang at both or 1 of the 3’ ends .(28)  Such siRNAs can be designed to target an endogenous 
messenger RNA (mRNA) t ranscript of a given gene.  When introduced into cells, the net effect 
of an RNAi -based pharmacological approach is the binding of the siRNA to its complementary 
mRNA sequence, cleavage of this target mRNA, and reduction of synthesis of the target protein,  
resulting in a decrease of the target protein levels. (29)  The ability to selectively and potently 
degrade the mRNA encoding the ALAS1 protein (thereby decreasing accumulation of the toxic 
intermediates ALA and PBG) usi ng an siRNA is a novel approach for the prevention and 
treatment of acute attacks in patients with AIP.   
1.3. ALN -AS1 
ALN -AS1 (givosiran) comprises a synthetic siRNA covalently linked to a GalNAc containing 
ligand (ALN60519), specific for ALAS1 and formulated for administration via subcutaneous 
(SC) injection. ALN -60519 has a target region between nucleotide 918 to 937 of the ALAS1 
mRNA. Attachment to a triantennary GalNAc ligand to the siRNA enables its distribution to the 
liver (which is the primary site of A LAS1 synthesis), followed by intracellular delivery to 
hepatocytes via ASGPR, resulting in engagement of the RNAi pathway and suppression of 
hepatic ALAS1 protein synthesis.  
ALN -AS1 is currently in development for treatment of acute attacks in patients wit h AIP, the 
most common AHP.  
Further information on ALN -AS1, including the clinical and nonclinical experience to date, is 
available in in the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
1.4. Study Design Rationale  
This is a multicenter, open -label exte nsion study designed to evaluate the long -term safety and 
clinical activity of subcutaneously administered ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP who have 
completed clinical study ALN -AS1-001.  The primary endpoint for the study is the incidence of 
AEs.  
1.5. Dose Rationa le 
Clinical data from Part A and Part B of the ongoing study ALN -AS1-001 demonstrate that single 
(0.035 -2.5 mg/kg) and multiple (0.35 -1.0 mg/kg) doses of ALN -AS1 have been generally 
well-tolerated in patients with AIP who are ASHE.  Additionally, data from  this study indicate 
that a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1 results in near normalization of urine ALA and PBG 
levels, which is sustained for approximately 14 weeks.   
Patients in Part C of the ongoing study ALN -AS1-001 who are eligible for participation in this 
study will likely require a higher dose of ALN -AS1 to normalize ALA and PBG as they have 
102
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 7, 29 April 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  27 
  higher levels of ALAS1 upregulation and higher baseline levels of ALA and PBG, when 
compared to patients with AIP who are ASHE. (30)  For example, based on preliminary data in 
Part A and Par t B of the ALN -AS1-001 study, the mean PBG level of patients who are ASHE is 
21.9 mmol/mol Cr (N=28); whereas, in Part C of this study in patients with AHP who have 
recurrent porphyria attacks, the mean PBG level is approximately 49.3 mmol/mol Cr (N=12).  
The study starting dose and regimen of ALN -AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg as an SC injection administered 
every 3 months.  Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may approve changes to the ALN -
AS1 dosing regimen, including decreases in the dose level and changes in do sing frequency.  
However, any dosing regimen will not exceed a previously explored dose level or frequency that 
was determined to be safe and well -tolerated in study ALN -AS1-001. SRC, Health Authority and 
Ethics Committee approval must be sought prior to d ose level escalation above 5.0 mg/kg in 
accordance with local Regulatory requirements.  
The study starting dose and regimen was selected based on the benefit:risk profile of ALN -AS1 
in Part C of the ongoing ALN -AS1-001 study.  Preliminary data to date indic ate that 
administration of 5.0 mg/kg ALN -AS1 has been generally well -tolerated.  There have been no 
study drug -related serious adverse events ( SAEs ), severe AEs, or clinically significant changes in 
safety parameters.  While a single 2.5 mg/kg dose of ALN -AS1 has also been generally well -
tolerated when administered to patients in Part A and Part C of study ALN -AS1-001, this dose 
has not resulted in near normalization of ALA and PBG levels.  In addition, while emerging data 
from Part C indicate that an every  3 months dose of 2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1 demonstrated some 
clinical activity (eg, decrease in attack frequency and decrease in heme use), some patients 
continued to experience breakthrough porphyria attacks during the treatment period, indicating 
that a higher dose may be required.  
The duration of dosing in this study is supported by the overall favorable safety profile of 
ALN -AS1 in the ongoing clinical study ALN -AS1-001 and the absence of new findings in 
nonclinical studies with ALN -AS1.  
1.6. Clinical Data Summary  
1.6.1.  Clinical Pharmacodynamics  
Dosing has been completed in Part A and Part B of the study.  In both Parts A and B of the study, 
durable and dose -dependent reductions of ALAS1 mRNA (up to 66% in the 2.5 mg/kg dose 
group) as measured by cERD  were observed after ALN -AS1 treatment.  ALAS1 reductions were 
highly correlated with reductions in ALA (mean maximal 86%) PBG (mean maximal 95%) 
levels in a dose -dependent manner and were sustained for ≥180 days.  
Dosing is currently ongoing in Part C of t he study. The mean maximal reduction in ALAS1 
mRNA  relative to baseline in ALN -AS1-treated patients in Cohort 1 (2.5 mg/kg Q3M) was 39% 
and in Cohort 2 (2.5 mg/kg Q1M) 66%.  All patients treated with ALN -AS1 also had decreases 
in their peak ALA and PBG lev els in the treatment period compared to the run -in period, along 
with reduced fluctuations in these levels in the treatment period ( data not shown) . No reductions 
were observed in the placebo -treated patients.

Amendment 7, 29 April 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  28 
  1.6.2.  Clinical Activity  
Clinical activity was not e valuated in Parts A and B of the study because ASHE patients included 
in this study were not actively experiencing attacks of porphyria.  
Dosing is currently ongoing in Part C of the study. All patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 were enrolled 
in a run -in phase for  10-15 weeks that was followed by a treatment phase for up to 24 weeks.  No 
investigational product was administered during the run -in phase.  Therefore, each patient acted 
as their own control, allowing for individual ALA / PBG levels, and overall attack rate while on 
ALN -AS1 treatment to be compared to that observed in the run -in phase.   
Figure  1 shows in Cohort 1 ALN -AS1-treated patients there was a 74% mean decrease in the 
annualized attack rate for the treatment period versus the run -in period (range: 63 -94% 
reduction), compared with a 23% decrease in the annualized attack rate for the placebo -treated 
patient.  In ALN -AS1-treated patients this was a ccompanied by an approximate 76% mean 
decrease in annualized acute hemin usage (range 52 -95%) and a 10.3 times increase in the 
maximal attack free interval compared to run -in period (range 4.2 -16.3).  
Figure 1: Part C  Cohort 1 Summary of Treatment Period Clinical Efficacy Relative to 
Run-in 
 
Figure  2 shows in Cohort 2 ALN -AS1-treated patients, there was a 58% mean decrease in the 
annualized attack rate for the treatment period versus the run -in period (range: 45 -76% 
reduction).  This compares favorably with data from the placebo -treated patient who showed a 
34% reduction in the annualized attack rate for the treatme nt period versus the run -in period.  In 
ALN -AS1-treated patients, the reduction in attack rate was accompanied by a 92% mean 
decrease in annualized hemin usage (range 84 -100%) and a 2.7x increase in the mean maximal 
attack free interval compared to run -in period (range 2.1 -3.2).

1.6.3.  Clinical Safety  
In Part A and Part B of Study ALN -AS1-001, a total of 11 patients (11/13; 85.0%) wh o received 
ALN -AS1 reported at least 1 AE.  All 5 placebo -treated patients (5/5; 100%) reported at least 1 
AE.  AEs considered possibly or definitely related to ALN -AS1 were reported in 5 patients 
(5/13; 38%): diarrhoea, dyspepsia, hematochezia, injection site erythema, injection site pain, 
blood creatinine increased, glomerular filtration rate decreased, and hypoesthesia (each AE 
reported only by an individual patient; 1/13; 8% each).  There were 2 SAEs of abdominal pain: 1 
patient each in the 0.035 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg ALN -AS1 dose groups.  Both were considered to 
be not related and resolved without sequelae.  There were no AEs leading to discontinuation.  All 
AEs were mild or moderate in severity, except for 1 of the SAEs of abdominal pain (0.10 mg/kg 
dose group), which was considered severe. Adverse events related to abnormal laboratory values 
were seen in 1 patient in the 0.35 mg/kg ALN -AS1 dose group who had AEs of ALT increased 
and AST increased, which were moderate and considered by the Investigator to  be unrelated to 
ALN -AS1.  No clinically significant findings were observed with routine monitoring of CRP and 
a panel of 9 proinflammatory cytokines collected predose and up to 24 hours post -dose.  There 
were no other clinically significant laboratory abn ormalities related to study drug or changes in 
vital signs, or ECGs in patients who were administered ALN AS1 or placebo.  
Dosing is ongoing in Part C of the study. All patients who received ALN -AS1 in cohort 1 and 2 
reported at least 1 AE.  AEs that were r eported in at least 2 subjects were nausea in 3 patients 
(50%) and abdominal pain, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, headache, cough and oropharyngeal pain 
in 2 patients (33.3%) each.  All AEs were mild or moderate in severity.  AEs considered possibly 
or definit ely related to ALN -AS1 were reported in 4 patients (66.6%), 1 each:  renal impairment 
in Cohort 1 and injection site reaction, myalgia, and headache in Cohort 2. Both placebo -treated 
patients reported AEs.  No AE was experienced in more than 1 patient.  
In Part C, Cohort 1 or 2, there were no SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation in patients 
administered ALN -AS1 or placebo. No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities related to 
study drug or changes in vital signs, ECG, or physical exam findings wer e observed in patients 
administered ALN -AS1 or placebo.  
Part C Cohort 3 5.0 mg/kg SC monthly dosing is ongoing.  In this cohort there was one fatal 
SAE of acute pancreatitis, which was determined to be unlikely related to study drug or placebo 
105
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 7, 29 April 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  30 
  by the Inves tigator due to the presence of gall bladder sludge found at the time of her 
presentation.  Contributors to this patient's adverse clinical course included: pre -existing chronic 
debilitation from recurrent AIP attacks requiring monthly hospitalization, porp hyria -attributed 
quadriplegia requiring nursing home care, delay in hospital admission and complications from 
thromboembolism (multiple risk factors included pancreatitis, obesity, immobilisation from 
quadriparesis and recent hospitalization for infected p ortacath removal).  Serum lipase was added 
to all scheduled laboratory assessments in November 2016 as part of additional safety 
monitoring. To date, all lipase results (available in 11 of 15 subjects) have been at or below the 
upper limit of normal with n o trends seen with dosing of study drug or placebo.  
Further information on the safety, efficacy, PK and PD of ALN -AS1 are available in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.6.4.  Drug -Drug Interactions  
An open -label drug -drug interaction (DDI) study (ALN -AS1-004) was co nducted in AIP patients 
who are ASHE to evaluate the effect of a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1 administered SC 
on the pharmacokinetics of probe substrates for 5  major CYP enzymes that account for the 
metabolism of approximately 80% of prescribed drugs. (31, 32)  Results from this study 
demonstrated that ALN -AS1 treatment resulted in weak to moderate reduction in the metabolic 
activity of some of the 5  CYP enzymes studied, thereby leading to higher concentrations of some 
substrates and their metabolites.  Treatment with ALN -AS1 resulted in an approximately 3 -fold 
increase in exposure (as measured by AUC) of caffeine (a sensitive substrate for CYP1A2) an d 
an approximately 2 -fold increase in exposure of dextromethorphan (a sensitive substrate for 
CYP2D6).  Exposure of midazolam (a sensitive substrate for CYP3A4) and omeprazole (a 
sensitive substrate for CYP2C19) increased less than 2 -fold after treatment w ith ALN -AS1.  
There was no effect of ALN -AS1 treatment on losartan (a sensitive substrate for CYP2C9).  
1.7. Benefit -Risk Assessment  
Patients participating in this study may experience a reduced number or severity of porphyria 
attacks, reduced treatment with IV hemin, and/or reduced requirement for pain medication.  As 
presented in Section  1.6, emerging data  demonstrate that patients given ALN -AS1 experienced 
reduced ALA/PBG levels, decreased attack frequency and reduced heme usage in the 24 -week 
treatment period compared to the 12 -week run -in period in Study ALN -AS1-001 
As detailed in Section  1.6, a fatal SAE of hemorrhagic pancreatitis was reported but deemed to 
be unlikely related to study drug.  However, the potentially non -adverse nonclinical finding of 
angiectasis in the islets of Langerha ns (endocrine, not exocrine region) of the rat pancreas (see 
Investigator Brochure), do not exclude a potential association between ALN -AS1 and the SAE of 
hemorrhagic pancreatitis.  
The important potential risks associated with administration of ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP 
are as follows:  
• Injection site reactions (ISRs):  ALN -AS1 is administered by SC injection.  In the 
ongoing ALN -AS1 clinical study, AEs of ISRs have been infrequently reported and 
have been mild to moderate in severity with single dosing.  Injection site rotation and 
106
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 7, 29 April 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  31 
  close monitoring have been implemented in ALN -AS1 clinical studies to reduce the 
potential for ISRs.  
• Pancreatitis: Since an association between ALN -AS1 and the fatal SAE of 
hemorrhagic pancreatitis can not be ruled out, patien ts will undergo routine 
monitoring of systemic and pancreatic inflammation and coagulation throughout the 
study.  Hematology, chemistry and coagulation results are required to be available 
prior to each dose.  
• Liver transaminase abnormalities:  As ALN -AS1 i s targeted for delivery to the liver, 
and reversible hepatic changes were observed in some animal species, there is a 
potential for development of liver function test ( LFT) abnormalities.  To minimize the 
potential for LFT abnormalities, patients are requi red to have adequate liver function 
at study entry and LFTs are monitored during the study.  
• Anaphylactic reactions:  There is a potential risk of developing a severe allergic 
reaction with ALN -AS1 administration.  In the present study, one patient in the 
2.5 mg/kg monthly dose group with a history of asthma and multiple allergies 
experienced an SAE of anaphylactic reaction that was determined by the Investigator 
to be definitely related to study drug given the temporal relationship of ALN -AS1 
treatment to t he onset of the reaction (within minutes).  The patient was treated and 
recovered and was discontinued from the study.  Guidance on dose administration 
and monitoring for anaphylactic reactions has been included in this protocol.  
The complete summary of th e clinical and nonclinical data relevant to the investigational drug 
and its study in human subjects is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.

4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.1. Summary of Study Design  
This is a Phase 1/2 multicenter, o pen-label extension study to evaluate the long -term safety and 
clinical activity of ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP who completed study ALN -AS1-001.  The 
study will be conducted at up to 8 clinical study centers worldwide.  
The last assessments performed, dete rmining previous study (ALN -AS1-001) completion, will 
serve as the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed 
since the last assessment, safety assessments (eg, ECG and clinical laboratory tests) will be 
repeated befor e administration of ALN -AS1.  It is anticipated that patients will begin ALN -AS1 
administration in this study within 6 months after the last dose of study drug in the previous 
study.  Eligibility will be confirmed during Screening/Baseline and before admin istration of the 
first dose of ALN -AS1 (Day 1).  Patients will undergo assessments at the clinical study center 
every month for the first 3 months.  Then, through Month 6, and according to the dosing regimen 
selected, assessments will take place at the cli nical study center or via a phone contact (for an 
every month dosing regimen, visits will be every month; for an every 3 months dosing regimen, 
visits will be every 3 months; see Section  6.2.2 ).  After a patient has completed 12 months of 
ALN -AS1 administration in this study (6 months in an every month dosing regimen), and where 
applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, study procedures, including 
108
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 7, 29 April 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  33 
  ALN -AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional (as 
indicated in the Schedules of Assessments in  Table 1, Table  2, and Table  3; and Table  5, Table  6, 
and Table  7 in Appendix Section  11.2).  If the patient is unable to come to the study site, and a 
visit by a home healthcare professional is not possible due to circumstances related to the 
COVID -19 pandemic, ALN -AS1 may be admi nistered by the patient or the caregiver under the 
oversight of the Investigator, and following consultation with the medical monitor, as allowed by 
applicable country and local regulations.  In such cases, the patient or caregiver must receive 
appropriate  training on ALN -AS1 administration and the use of epinephrine (epi pen or 
equivalent) prior to dosing.  This measure is intended to remain in effect only during periods of 
time when the COVID -19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the st udy site or 
healthcare professionals to go to patients' homes for dosing.  Study procedures may occur at the 
patient’s home at the discretion of the Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, 
patients are required to complete at least 1 visit  at the clinical study center every 3 months for the 
first year, and thereafter every 6 months through the end of the treatment period.  Additional 
visits to collect c linical laboratory samples may occur at home at any point during the treatment 
period, wi thin 14 days prior to scheduled dose administration.  Patients will return to the clinical 
study center for a posttreatment follow -up visit after administration of the last dose of ALN -AS1.   
An ALA/PBG Monitoring/EOS visit will be conducted either at the c linical study center or via 
phone contact, unless treatment continues with ALN -AS1.  
Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain 
assessments, and narcotic use.  Additionally, patients will be encouraged to re port to the clinical 
study center if they experience a porphyria attack through Month 49.  In the event that patients 
are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laboratory sample 
collection kits containing instructions for  collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical 
study center, if possible, will be provided.  Patients will be contacted by phone after a porphyria 
attack to record attack details.  If patients are experiencing signs and symptoms of a porphyria 
attac k when ALN -AS1 administration is scheduled, the Investigator will determine whether 
administration of ALN -AS1 is appropriate.  If patients are treated for a porphyria attack at a 
health care facility (eg, hospital, emergency department, infusion center, or  outpatient clinic) 
other than the clinical study center, copies of medical records, including discharge summaries, 
will be requested.   
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review safety and tolerability data collected during the 
study with the primary pu rpose of protecting the safety of patients participating in the study (see 
Section  4.6). 
Patients may receive ALN -AS1 as long as they do not fulfill  any of the study discontinuation 
criteria (see Section  5.3) or until ALN -AS1 is commercially available in the patient’s territory or 
the ALN -AS1 develop ment program is discontinued (whichever comes first).  
All patients are asked to participate in a Posttreatment Follow -up visit after they have received 
their last dose of ALN -AS1.

a Patients  who discontinue treatment will be asked to complete an early termination (ET) visit at which all Month  49 
visit procedures will be performed; they must also return for a safety -follow -up visit 3  months (84 [ +14] days) 
after their last dose of ALN -AS1.  
4.2. Duration of Treatment and Study  
The duration of treatment is up to 48 months.  The estimated total time on study, inclusive of 
Screening/Baseline, for each patient is up to 56 months.   
4.3. Number of Patients  
Up to 24 patients are planned for enrollment in this s tudy (including optional cohorts in 
ALN -AS1-001). 
4.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups  
This is an open -label study; all p atients will receive ALN -AS1.  A combination of the clinical 
study center number and screening number will create the uniqu e patient identifier.  The clinical 
study center number will be assigned by the Sponsor.  Upon signing the Informed Consent Form 
(ICF), the patient will be assigned a screening number by the clinical study site, which will be 
the same unique patient identi fier assigned in the previous study (ALN -AS1-001).  The 
Investigator, or delegate, will confirm that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of 
the exclusion criteria.  
4.5. Blinding  
This is an open -label study, and all patients will receive ALN -AS1.

administration.  Acceptable methods include hormonal methods along with an additional 
barrier met hod (eg, condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap), or a double barrier method of 
contraception for those WOCBP for whom a hormonal method of contraception is 
medically contraindicated due to underlying disease  (see Section  6.4 for acceptable 
methods of contraception ).   
4. Willing and able to comply with the study requirements and to provide written informed 
consent  
5.2. Exclus ion Criteria  
Each patient must not meet any of the following exclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment in 
this study : 
1. Alanine transaminase ≥2.0×ULN or total bilirubin ≥2 mg/dL (unless bilirubin elevation is 
due to Gilbert’s syndrome)  
2. Estimated glome rular filtration rate ≤30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (using the Modification of Diet 
in Renal Disease formula)  
3. History of multiple drug allergies or history of allergic reaction to an oligonucleotide or

4. Received an investigati onal agent, other than ALN -AS1, or who are in follow -up of 
another clinical study of an investigational agent within 90 days before study drug 
administration  
5. Other medical conditions or comorbidities which, in the opinion of the Investigator, 
would interfe re with study compliance or data interpretation  
5.3. Discontinuation of Study Drug and/or Study  
Patients or their legal guardians (in the case that the patient is a minor) are free to discontinue 
treatment and/or study or withdraw their consent at any time and for any reason, without penalty 
to their continuing medical care.  Any discontinuation of treatment or of the study must be fully 
documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF), and should be followed up by the 
111
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 7, 29 April 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  36 
  Investigator.  The Investigator may wit hdraw a patient from the study at any time if this is 
considered to be in the patient’s best interest.  
Discontinuation of study drug and withdrawal from the study are described in Section  5.3.1  and 
Section  5.3.2 , respectively.  If a patient stops participation from the study or withdraws consent 
from the study, he/she will not be able to re -enroll in the study.  
5.3.1.  Discontinuation of Study Drug  
The Inves tigator or designee may discontinue dosing in a patient if the patient:  
• Is in violation of the protocol  
• Experiences a SAE considered to be possibly or definitely related to the study drug or 
an intolerable AE  
• Becomes pregnant  
• Is found to be considerably n oncompliant with the protocol -requirements  
Patients who are pregnant will be discontinued from study drug dosing immediately (see 
Section  7.5.6.6  for reporting and follow -up of pregnancy).  A positive urine pregnancy test 
should be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test prior to discontinuing the study drug.  
If a patient discontinues dosing due to a serious adverse event (SAE), the SAE should be 
followed as described in Section  7.5.6 .  When a patient disc ontinues study drug dosing, the 
primary reason must be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  Patients who 
discontinue study drug and remain on study may receive treatment consistent with local standard 
practice for their disease per Investig ator judgement, as applicable.  
Patients who discontinue treatment will be asked to complete an early termination (ET) visit at 
which all Month 49 visit procedures will be performed; they must also return for a safety -follow -
up visit 3 months (84 [ +14] days) after their last dose of ALN -AS1.  
5.3.2.  Discontinuation from the Study  
A patient or their legal guardian may decide to stop the patient’s participation in the study at any 
time.  Patients considering to stop the study should be informed that they can disco ntinue 
treatment and complete study assessments including follow -up, as per the SOA, or alternatively 
may complete any minimal assessments for which the patient consents. The Investigator may 
withdraw a patient at any time if this is considered to be in th e patient’s best interest.  
However, study integrity and interpretation is best maintained if all randomized patients continue 
study assessments and follow -up.  Stopping study participation could mean:  
• If a patient discontinues from the study, he/she will b e asked to complete an early 
termination (ET) visit at which all Month 49 visit procedures will be performed; the 
patient must also return for a safety -follow -up visit at 3 months (84 [+14] days) after 
his/her last dose of ALN -AS1.  
• A patient can stop takin g the study drug and stop study -related visits, but allow the 
investigator and study team to review the patient’s medical records, public records or 
be contacted in order to receive information about the patient’s health  
112
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 7, 29 April 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  37 
  When a patient stops the study, the  discontinuation and reason for discontinuation must be 
recorded  in the appropriate section of the electronic case report form (eCRF) and all efforts will 
be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible.  If a patient stops the 
study due to an adverse event (AE), including an SAE, the AE should be followed as described 
in Section  7.5.6 . 
If the patient wants to stop participati on in the study, he/she should notify the study doctor in 
writing or in any other form that may be locally required. The personal data already collected 
during the study, including patient’s biological samples, will still be used together with the data 
collected on other patients in the study according to the informed consent and applicable laws.  
In addition to stopping participation in the study, the patient could decide to withdraw his/her 
consent as explained in Section  5.3.3  
5.3.3.  Withdrawal  of Consent to Collect and Process the Patient’s Personal Data  
The patient may decide to withdraw his/her consent informing the study doctor at any time in 
writing, or  in any other form that may be locally required.  This  means that the patient wants to 
stop participation in the study and any further collection of his/her personal data.  
• The sponsor will continue to keep and use a patient's study information (including 
any data resulting from the analysis of the patient's biological samples until time of 
withdrawal) according to applicable law.  This is done to guarantee the validity of the 
study, determine the effects of the study treatment, and ensure completeness of s tudy 
documentation.  
• The patient can also request that collected samples be destroyed or returned (to the 
extent it is permitted by applicable law) at any time.  
• Patients who withdraw their consent to collect and use personal data should 
understand that publ ic records may be reviewed to determine the patient’s survival 
status as allowed per local and national regulations.    
In US and Japan, otherwise, samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal may still be used 
for further testing/analysis in accorda nce with the terms of the protocol and of the informed 
consent form.  
In EU and rest of world, in any event, samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal will 
not be used any longer, unless permitted by applicable law. They will be stored or destroyed  
according to applicable legal requirements.  
5.3.4.  Replacement of Patients  
Patients discontinuing from study drug or withdrawing from the study will not be replaced.

  6. TREATMENTS  
6.1. Treatments Administered  
ALN -AS1 Solution for Injection (SC use) is a clear, colorless  to pale yellow solution essentially 
free of particulates.  ALN -AS1 will be supplied by the Sponsor as a sterile solution for SC 
injection.  
Study drug supplied for this study must not be used for any purpose other than the present study 
and must not be adm inistered to any person not enrolled in the study.  Study drug that has been 
dispensed to a patient and returned unused must not be re -dispensed to a different patient.  
6.2. Investigational Study Drug  
Detailed information describing the preparation, handling, a nd storage, packaging and labeling, 
as well as study drug accountability for ALN -AS1 is provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.2.1.  Description  
ALN -AS1 Solution for Injection (SC use) is comprised of a synthetic, siRNA targeting ALAS1 
and bearing a triantennary GalNAc ligand conjugated to the sense strand, formulated in 
phosphate buffer.  
6.2.2.  Dose and Administration  
The study starting dose of ALN -AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg ALN -AS1 as an SC injection administered 
every 3 months (Table  1, Table  2, and Table  3). Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may 
approve changes to the ALN -AS1 dosing regimen, including decreases in the dose level and 
changes in dosing frequency (Table  5, Table  6, and Table  7 in Section  11.2).  However, any dose 
and dosing regimen will not exceed a previously explored dose level or frequency that was 
determined to be safe and well -tolerated in study ALN -AS1-001. SRC, Health Autho rity and 
Ethics Committee approval must be sought prior to dose level escalation above 5.0 mg/kg in 
accordance with local Regulatory requirements.  See Section  6.2.3  for details on dose 
modifications.  
The study drug should be injected into the abdomen or upper arms or thighs.  Detailed 
instructions for study drug administration are presented in the Pharmacy Manual. As is consistent 
with good medical pr actice for subcutaneous drug administration, patients will be observed for a 
minimum of 20 minutes after each injection.   Treatment for anaphylactic reactions should be 
readily available where patients are being dosed, and follow country and/or local hosp ital 
treatment guidelines as shown in Table  8.(33) 
ALN -AS1 will be administered by a qualified and authorized health care professional trained in 
the recognition and management of anaphylactic reactions.  After a patient has completed  12 
months of ALN -AS1 administration in this study (6  months in an every month dosing regimen), 
study drug administration may be conducted at a location other than the study center by a home 
healthcare professional, where applicable country and local regul ations and infrastructure allow, 
after consultation with the medical monitor, during particular study visits, as specified in the 
Schedules of Assessments.  If the patient is unable to come to the study site, and a visit by a 
home healthcare professional i s not possible due to circumstances related to the COVID -19 
114
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 7, 29 April 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  39 
  pandemic, ALN -AS1 may be administered by the patient or the caregiver under the oversight of 
the Investigator, and following consultation with the medical monitor, as allowed by applicable 
country  and local regulations.  In such cases, the patient or caregiver must receive appropriate 
training on ALN -AS1 administration and the use of epinephrine (epi pen or equivalent) prior to 
dosing.  This measure is intended to remain in effect only during perio ds of time when the 
COVID -19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the study site or healthcare 
professionals to go to patients' homes for dosing.  However, study drug administration at the 
study center should be considered for patients who  have ongoing study drug -related AEs or 
known risk factors for developing anaphylactic reaction, including but not limited to: a prior 
history of anaphylactic reaction to food, medications or due to unknown etiology, worsening 
injection site reactions with  repeat dosing, or anyone in the opinion of the investigator that would 
benefit from clinical observation following dosing.  Patients are required to complete at least 1 
visit at the clinical study center every 3 months for the first year, and thereafter e very 6 months 
through the end of the treatment period.  Additional visits to collect clinical laboratory samples 
may occur at home at any point during the treatment period, within 14 days prior to scheduled 
dose administration.  
If a patient does not receiv e a dose of ALN -AS1 within the specified dosing window, the 
Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor.  After such consultation, the dose may be 
administered or considered missed and not administered.  
Patients will be permitted to miss an occasional dose of study drug; however, if a patient misses 
2 consecutive doses, the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, will discuss 
whether the patient will be able to continue on the study.  
Detailed instructions for study drug administration a re found in the Pharmacy Manual.   In 
addition, instructions and procedures related to administration of ALN -AS1 by a patient or 
caregiver will be provided in the Patient/Caregiver Storage and Administration Instructions.  
6.2.3.  Dose Modifications  
6.2.3.1.  Study Population  Dose Modifications  
During the study, dose modifications are permitted for the study population, or based on the dose 
cohort into which patients were originally randomized in study ALN -AS1-001.  Following SRC 
review of emerging safety and tolerability data  from Part C of study ALN -AS1-001, or from this 
study (ALN -AS1-002), the dose and dosing regimen may be modified.  However, the dose and 
dosing regimen of ALN -AS1 will not exceed a previously explored dose and dosing regimen that 
was determined to be safe and well -tolerated in study ALN -AS1-001.  Patients enrolling in this 
study after a dose modification decision has been implemented may start at the newly identified 
dose and regimen.  
6.2.3.2.  Individual Dose Modifications  
Dose modifications are permitted for indivi dual patients.  If a patient has a study drug related AE 
of a recurrent ISR, severe ISR, or clinically significant LFT abnormality and the Investigator has 
concerns regarding further ALN -AS1 administration, the Medical Monitor and Investigator will 
review all available safety data for the patient.  Based on this review, a dose reduction to half the 
previously administered dose (eg, a 5.0 mg/kg dose would be reduced to a 2.5 mg/kg dose) or a 
115
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 7, 29 April 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  40 
  reduction in dosing frequency from monthly to every 3 months is per mitted.  Subsequent ALN -
AS1 administration at the previous dose may be considered based on the judgment of the 
Investigator and Medical Monitor.  
6.2.3.2.1.  Monitoring and Dosing Rules in Patients with Potential Cases of Anaphylactic 
Reaction   
An anaphylactic reactio n is a severe, potentially fatal, systemic allergic reaction with acute onset 
(minutes to hours).  For reference see Section  11.3.(33) 
Stop administering the study medication immediately  if an anaphylactic reaction to the study 
medication is suspected.  Study medication must be permanently discontinued in patients for 
whom an anaphylact ic reaction is assessed as related to the study medication.  
Laboratory testing:  Obtain blood sample for tryptase, total IgE, and ADA  antidrug antibodies 
(ADA) ideally within 15 minutes to 3 hours after the onset of a suspected anaphylactic reaction; 
however, up to 6 hours is acceptable.  An additional blood sample to assess tryptase, total IgE, 
and ADA should be obtained between  1 to 2  weeks from onset of event.  Local laboratory may 
be used to analyze samples; however, parallel samples should be sent to the central laboratory for 
analysis.  Sample collection and shipping instructions are included in the Laboratory Manual.  
Reporting : The PI or designee must notify the sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the 
occurrence of a suspected case of anaphylactic reaction or being informed of the case as required 
for AEs of Clinical Interest (AECI) and SAEs, per AE reporting requirements (Secti on 7.5.6.1 ,  
Section  7.5.6.2  and 7.5.6.3 ). 
6.2.4.  Preparation, Handling, and Storage  
Staff at each clinical study center, or the home healthcare professional, will be responsible for 
preparation of ALN -AS1 doses, according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy Manual .  In 
cases where ALN -AS1 is administered at home by a patient/caregiver, dosing may be prepared 
and administered by the patient/caregiver according to procedures detailed in the 
Patient/Caregiver Storage and Administration Instructions .  No special procedures for the safe 
handling of study drug are required.  
Study drug will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately 5±3°C.  
A Sponsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, 
storage, dispensing procedures, and records.  
Additional storage and preparation details are provided in the Pharmacy Manual and the 
Patient/Caregiver Storage and Administration Instructions  
6.2.5.  Packaging and Labe ling 
All packaging, labeling, and production of study drug will be in compliance with current Good 
Manufacturing Practice specifications, as well as applicable local regulations.  Study drug labels 
and external packaging will include all appropriate inform ation as per local labeling 
requirements.  
Additional details will be available in the Pharmacy Manual.

  6.2.6.  Accountability  
The Investigator or designee will maintain accurate records of receipt and the condition of the 
study drug supplied for this study, including dates of receipt.  In addition, accurate records will 
be kept of when and how much study drug is dispensed and administered to each patient in the 
study.  Any reasons for departure from the protocol dispensing regimen must also be recorded.  
At th e completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of all study drugs.  All used, 
partially used, and unused study drug will be returned to the Sponsor (or designee) or destroyed 
at the clinical study center according to applicable regulations .   
Further instructions about drug accountability are detailed in the Pharmacy Manual.  
 
6.3. Concomitant Medications  
Use of concomitant medications will be recorded on the patient’s case report form (CRF) as 
indicated in the Schedules of Assessments ( Table 1, Table  2, and Table  3; and Table  5, Table  6, 
and Table  7 in Appendix Section  11.2).  This includes all prescription medications, herbal 
preparations, over the counter (OTC) medications, vitamins, and minerals.  Any changes in 
medications during the study will also be recorded on the CRF.  
Any concomitant medicati on that is required for the patient’s welfare may be administered by the 
Investigator.  However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding 
the medication are recorded on the eCRF.  Concomitant medication will be coded us ing an 
internationally recognized and accepted coding dictionary.  
Patients with porphyria could have altered hepatic heme synthesis, and treatment with ALN -AS1 
could also modulate this pathway and secondarily impact CYP enzyme activity.  Results from a 
DDI study in AIP patients who are ASHE are presented in Section  1.6.4 .  The DDI study 
demonstrated that ALN -AS1 treatment resulted in weak to moderate redu ction in activity in 
some of the CYP enzymes resulting in corresponding low to moderate increase in the plasma 
levels of drugs that are metabolized by these CYP enzymes.  Based on the moderate decrease in 
CYP2D6 or CYP1A2 activity, investigators will revie w all concomitant medications that are 
primarily metabolized by these enzymes and monitor the patient’s clinical response to these 
medications during the study.  Medications metabolized primarily by CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 
with a narrow therapeutic index (ie tha t require regular laboratory monitoring) may need to be 
monitored more frequently to determine if a dose adjustment of the concomitant medication is 
required.  For patients who require new medications while on study, selection of medications that 
are not p rimarily metabolized by CYP2D6 or CYP1A2 should be considered.  Refer to the 
individual product’s prescription information to determine if there is a need to monitor 
concomitant medications for differences in safety or efficacy of the medication based on r eported 
DDIs with CYP2D6 or CYP1A2.  For more detailed and up -to-date information on CYP 
substrates, see: 
https://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/developmentresources/druginteractionsl
abeling/ucm093664.htm.  
Patients are not permitted to be on hemin prophylaxis at Screening; however, patients are 
permitted to receive concomitant hemin treatment for the management of acute porphyria 
attacks.  Patients experiencing significant breakthrough attacks while enrolled  in this study, 
117
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 7, 29 April 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  42 
  necessitating frequent hemin treatment, may receive hemin prophylaxis if in the Investigator’s 
judgment this is clinically beneficial to the patient.  The Investigator should contact with the 
Sponsor and Medical Monitor before prophylactic hemin treatment.  The dose, regimen, and 
dates of administration will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF.   
Pain medication (eg, opiates, opioids, narcotic analgesics) and glucose administration are 
permitted for the management of porphyria and for acute po rphyria attacks.  
If patients use nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory medications intermittently or chronically, they 
must have been able to tolerate them with no previous side effects (eg, gastric distress or 
bleeding).   
Standard vitamins and topical medicatio ns are permitted; however, topical steroids must not be 
applied anywhere near the injection site(s) unless medically indicated.  
6.4. Contraceptive Requirements  
No data are available on the use of ALN -AS1 in pregnancy; however, there is no suspicion of 
human ter atogenicity based on class effects or genotoxic potential.  ALN -AS1 was neither 
genotoxic nor clastogenic in in vitro and in vivo studies.   
WOCBP must be willing to use acceptable methods of contraception 14 days before first dose, 
throughout study partic ipation, and for 90 days after last dose administration.   
Birth control methods which may be considered as acceptable include:  
• Established use of oral, implantable, injectable, transdermal hormonal, or intrauterine 
hormone -releasing system as methods of c ontraception.  WOCBP using hormonal 
methods of contraception must also use a barrier method  (condom or occlusive cap 
[diaphragm or cervical/vault cap] in conjunction with spermicide [eg, foam, gel, film, 
cream, or suppository]).  
• If hormonal methods of cont raception are medically contraindicated for WOCBP due 
to underlying disease, a double -barrier method (combination of male condom with 
either cap, diaphragm, or sponge, in conjunction with spermicide) is also considered 
an acceptable method of contraception . 
• Placement of an intrauterine device  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post -vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the 
study, the vasectomized male par tner should be the sole partner for that patient)  
• Sexual abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
patient, is considered an acceptable method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entir e period of risk associated with the study 
drug (defined above).  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not considered sexual abstinence and do 
not meet criteria for an acceptable method of birth control.  As determined by the 
investigator, the reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to 
118
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 7, 29 April 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  43 
  the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Abstinent patients must agree to use 1 of  the abovementioned contraceptive methods 
if they start a heterosexual relationship during the study and continue to do so for the 
entire period of risk associated with the study drug (defined above).  
• WOCBP includes any female patient who has experienced m enarche and who is not 
postmenopausal or permanently sterilized (eg, bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, 
or bilateral salpingectomy).  Postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 
months without an alternative medical cause, confirmed by follic le stimulating 
hormone level within the postmenopausal range.  
6.5. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with study drug administration will be verified through observation by study 
personnel or trained home healthcare professionals.  
7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
The schedules of study assessments are provided in Table 1, Table  2, and Table  3; and Table  5, 
Table  6, and Table  7. 
Where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow for home healthcare, 
healthcare may take place at a location other than the clinical trial site to perform study 
assessments including targeted physic al exam/body system assessment, assessments for vital 
signs, and collection of blood and urine samples for safety laboratory assessments, and PD 
assessments, at all timepoints as specified in the Schedule of Assessments.  
7.1. Screening/Baseline Assessments  
Informed consent, patient demographic data, and eligibility criteria will be confirmed at 
Screening/Baseline.  An interval medical history/disease history will be obtained at 
Screening/Baseline.  The last assessments performed, determining previous study 
(ALN -AS1-001) completion, will serve as the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If 
more than 60 days have elapsed since the last assessment, clinical laboratory tests and ECGs will 
be repeated before administration of ALN -AS1.  
7.2. Clinical Activity A ssessments  
The clinical activity of ALN -AS1 will be assessed by the frequency and characteristics of 
porphyria attacks including, but not limited to, duration, treatment, and severity of porphyria 
attacks and number and duration of visits to a health care setting for acute porphyria care (eg, 
hospital, emergency department, infusion center, or outpatient clinic).  Concomitant hemin 
administration will also be recorded.  
7.2.1.  Patient Diary  
Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphy ria attacks, pain 
assessments, and narcotic use.

  7.2.2.  Brief Pain Inventory -Short Form Questionnaire  
The Brief Pain Inventory -Short Form (BPI -SF) questionnaire will be used to evaluate pain .(34)  
The BPI will be completed as part of the patient diary.  
7.3. Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Blood and urine samples will be collected for assessment of ALN -AS1 PD parameters.  The PD 
effect of ALN -AS1 will be evaluated by urine ALA and PBG levels.  Blood and urine samples 
will be collected for assessment of circulating  ALAS1 mRNA levels in serum and in urine.  
Analysis for blood and urine PD parameters will take place at a central laboratory.   
Details regarding the processing and aliquoting of samples for storage and analyses will be 
provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
7.4. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate the PK profile of ALN -AS1 at the time points in the 
Schedule of Assessments.  A detailed schedule of time points for the collection of blood samples 
for PK analysis is in Table  4 in Appendix Section  11.1). 
The concentration of AL N-AS1 will be determined using a validated assay.  Details regarding 
the processing, shipping, and analysis of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
7.5. Safety Assessments  
The assessment of safety during the course of the study will consist of  the surveillance and 
recording of AEs including SAEs, recording of concomitant medications and measurements of 
vital signs, physical examination, and ECG findings and clinical laboratory evaluations.  
Safety will be monitored over the course of the study b y an SRC as described in Section  4.6. 
7.5.1.  Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory 
rate.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be cons istent for each 
patient), after the patient has rested comfortably for at least 10 minutes.  Blood pressure should 
be taken using the same arm throughout the study.  Body temperature will be obtained in degrees 
Celsius, heart rate will be counted for a ful l minute and recorded in beats per minute, and 
respiration rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in breaths per minute.  
For the safety of the patient, additional vital sign assessments may be added at the discretion of 
the Investigator.  
7.5.2.  Weigh t and Height  
Height will be measured in centimeters at the Screening/Baseline visit only.  Body weight will be 
measured in kilograms.  Body mass index will be calculated in the database.  
Body weight measured on the dosing day will be used to calculate the dose of ALN -AS1 through 
M12.  After M12, weight obtained within 6 months during a study center visit or offsite may be 
used for dosing calculations.

  7.5.3.  Physical Examination  
Complete physical examinations will include the examination of the following:  general  
appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, chest/respiratory, heart/cardiovascular, 
gastrointestinal/liver, musculoskeletal/extremities, dermatological/skin, thyroid/neck, lymph 
nodes, and neurological/psychiatric.  
Targeted physical examinations will include the examination of the following:  general 
appearance, chest/respiratory, heart/cardiovascular, gastrointestinal/liver, and 
neurological/psychiatric.  
7.5.4.  Electrocardiogram  
Triplicate standard 12 -lead ECGs will be performed using central ECG equipment, with readings 
approximately 1 minute apart and recorded as specified in the Schedule of Assessments.  Patients 
should be seated or supine for at least 5 minutes before each ECG is obtained.  The 
electrophysiological parameters assessed will be rhythm, vent ricular rate, PR interval, QRS 
duration, QT interval, ST and T waves, Bazett -corrected QT interval (QTcB), and Fridericia 
corrected QT interval (QTcF).  
When ECG and blood sample collection occur at the same time, ECGs should be performed 
before blood samples are drawn.  
Using central ECG equipment, triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine 
position after the patient has rested comfortably for at least 5  minutes.   
In all patients receiving ≤2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1, it is required that ECGs will be obtained on at 
least 2 separate clinic visits (D1, and Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or 18) , each of which will include 
same day predose and 2 -hour (±15  minutes) postdose readings, paired with PK timepoints 
(Table  4) as specified in the Schedule of Assessments.   
Similarly, in all patients receiving >2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1, it is required that ECGs will be 
obtained on at least 2 separate clinic visits (D1, and Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or 18) , each of which 
will include same day predose and 4 -hour (±20  minutes) postdose readings, paired with PK 
timepoints ( Table  4), as specified in the Schedule of Assessments.  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for reviewing the  ECGs to assess whether the results 
have changed since the Screening/ Baseline visit and to determine the clinical relevance  of the 
results.  These assessments will be recorded on the eCRF.  For any clinically relevant ECG 
changes from the Screening/Baseline visit (eg, ischemic ECG changes, wave/interval changes, or 
arrhythmia), the Investigator must contact the Medical Monitor to discuss  continued participation 
of the patient in the study . 
7.5.5.  Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory.   
On dosing days up to the Month 18 visit, results from hematology, chemistry, and coag ulation 
tests collected within the prior 14 days must be reviewed by the Investigator before study drug 
administration.  These results can be analyzed centrally or at a local laboratory.  If results from 
within the prior 14 days are not available at a dosi ng visit (at visits from D1 to Month 18), 
locally analyzed assessments must be reviewed to allow same day study drug administration  and 
121
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 7, 29 April 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  46 
  additional samples for central analysis must  also be collected .  On dosing days from Month 19 
through Month 48, a review  of laboratory results within 14 days is not required.  
In the event of an unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study 
drug administration, the test should be repeated and followed up at the discretion of the 
Investigator until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis is made to 
adequately explain the abnormality.  
At any point during the study, and based on Investigator judgment, if a patient experiences 
uncharacteristic signs and symptoms durin g a porphyria attack, lipase testing should be 
performed and imaging evaluations (eg, right upper quadrant ultrasound and/or other testing, 
based on Investigator judgment) should be considered by the Investigator.  Signs and symptoms 
include, but are not l imited to, uncharacteristic abdominal pain and worsening nausea and 
vomiting.  
Imaging is required for any serum lipase result of ≥3× the upper limit of normal, or as clinically 
indicated.

  7.5.5.1.  Immunogenicity  
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate antidrug antibodies.  On days when ALN -AS1 is 
administered, blood samples for antidrug antibody testing must be collected before ALN -AS1 is  
administered.  
Sample collection for patients who experience a potential anaphylactic reaction is discussed in 
Section  6.2.3.2.1 . 
Details regarding the processing, shipping, and analysis of the samples will be provided in the 
Laboratory Manual.  
7.5.5.2.  Pregnancy Testing  
A pregnancy test will be performed for WOCBP only.  A serum pregnancy test will be 
performed at Screening/Baseline and urine pregnancy tests will be performed thereafter per the 
Schedule of Assessments and any time pregnancy is suspected.  Urine pregnancy tests may also 
be perform ed more frequently (eg, monthly) based on local country requirements.  The results of 
the pregnancy test must be known before study drug administration.  Patients who are pregnant 
are not eligible for study participation.  Any woman with a positive pregnan cy test during the 
study will be discontinued from study drug, but will continue to be followed for safety.  Patients 
determined to be pregnant while on study will be followed until the pregnancy outcome is known 
(see Section  7.5.6.6  for follow -up instructions).  
7.5.6.  Adverse Events  
7.5.6.1.  Definitions  
Adverse Event  
According to the ICH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 21 
Code of  Federal Regulations 312.32, Investigational New Drug Safety Reporting, an AE is any 
untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational subject administered a 
medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship wit h this treatment.  
Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (An event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred.  It does not include an ev ent that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above (eg, 
124
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 7, 29 April 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  49 
  events inclu de allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug 
dependency or abuse).  
Adverse Event Severity  
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below:  
Mild:  Mild events are those which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal 
daily activity.  
Moderate:  Moderate events are those which cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with 
normal daily activities.  
Severe:  Severe events are  those which incapacitate and prevent usual activity.  
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity.  AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of th e start and stop of each incidence.  When changes in the severity of an AE 
occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day should 
be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be 
recorded separately (with distinct onset dates)  
AE severity and seriousness are assessed independently.  ‘Severity’ characterizes the intensity of 
an AE.  ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for Serious Adverse Event).  
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Treatment  
The relationship of each AE to study treatment should be evaluated by the Investigator using the 
following criteria:  
Definitely r elated:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to the medication administration, and which 
cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
The response to withdrawal of th e drug should be clinically plausible.  
Possibly related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to the medication administration, but which 
could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals.  Information on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or 
unclear.  
Unlikely related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no 
temporal relationship to medication administration, and which other 
drugs, chemicals, or  underlying disease provide plausible explanations.  
Not related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality that has no 
temporal relationship to the medication or has more likely alternative 
etiology.

  Adverse Events of Clinical Interest  
The following events are considered to be adverse events of clinical interest:  
• ISRs  
• Hepatic AEs, including LFT abnormalities considered clinically significant by the 
Investigator . 
• Lipase >3×ULN (or >3× the baseline lipase measurement if baseline is >ULN)  
• Anaph ylactic Reactions. Anaphylactic reaction is a severe, potentially fatal, systemic 
allergic reaction with acute onset (minutes to hours).  Symptoms of an anaphylactic 
reaction  may include skin or mucosal tissue (e.g. generalized hives, pruritus, 
angioedema), respiratory compromise (e.g. wheezing, bronchospasm, hypoxia), 
reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (e.g. syncope, hypotonia).  See 
Section  11.3 (Table  8) for guidance on diagnosing anaphylactic reactions. (33) 
7.5.6.2.  Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last 
visit.  The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospitalized, had any accidents, used 
any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC).  
In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant 
laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are 
relevant to patient safety.  
Recording Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for recording non -serious AEs that are observed or reported by 
the patient after administration of the first dose of study drug regardless of their relationship to 
study drug through the end of study.  Non -serious AEs will b e followed until the end of study.  
The Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by the patient 
after the time when the informed consent is signed regardless of their relationship to study drug 
through the end of study.  SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until baseline level 
is reached, or until the SAE is considered by the Investigator to be chronic or the patient is 
stable, as appropriate.  
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinica l study center and in the eCRF for 
the patient, whether or not they are considered to be drug -related.  Each AE must be described in 
detail:  onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to investigational drug, 
action taken, and outco me (including time and date of resolution, if applicable).  
For SAEs, record the event(s) on the eCRF.  If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is 
unavailable, complete the backup SAE form.  
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest, the Spons or or its designee should be 
notified within 24 hours using a supplemental AEs of clinical interest (AECI) eCRF.  Additional 
clinical and laboratory information may be collected based upon the severity or nature of the 
event.  
126
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 7, 29 April 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  51 
  If a patient has ISRs meeting any of the following criteria, the Investigator or delegate should 
contact the Medical Monitor and submit a supplemental ISR eCRF:  
• ISRs that are recurrent and/or demonstrate a pattern of increasing severity  
• Any ISR that is determined to be severe and/or a cause for study drug discontinuation  
• Any ISR which, in the opinion of the Investigator, requires further medical evaluation 
or treatment  
In some cases, where it is medically appropriate, further evaluation may include photographs, 
referral to a dermatolog ist, skin biopsy, or other laboratory testing.  If a biopsy was obtained, the 
Sponsor may request that the biopsy also be reviewed by a central dermatopathologist.  To better 
understand the safety profile of the study drug, additional analysis of biopsy ti ssue may be 
performed according to local regulations.  
For patients with hepatic AEs, additional information, including, clinical history, course of event, 
and local laboratory results to monitor LFT levels or other laboratory parameters, may be 
collected.  
7.5.6.3.  Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee  
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by the Investigator.  Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section  7.5.6.1  must be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee within 24 hours from the time that clinical study center personnel first 
learns of the event.  All SAEs must be reported regardless of the relationship to study drug.  
The initial report should include at least the following information:  
• Patient’s study number  
• Description and date of onset of the event  
• Criterion for serious  
• Preliminary assignment of relationship to study drug  
• Investigator/clinical study center information  
To report the SAE, complete the eCRF.  If the EDC system is unavailable, complete the backup 
SAE form.  Within 24 hours of receipt of follow -up information, the Investigator must update the 
report.  SAEs must  be reported using the contact information provided in the Study Manual.  
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken by the Investigator using his/her best medical 
judgment to treat the SAE.  These measures and the patient’s response to these measures sh ould 
be recorded.  All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be followed by the 
Investigator until satisfactory resolution or the Investigator deems the SAE to be chronic or 
stable.  Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be em ployed by the Investigator as 
needed to adequately determine the etiology of the event.  
7.5.6.4.  Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities  
The Sponsor or its representative is required to report certain study events in an expedited 
manner to the Food and D rug Administration, the European Medicines Agency’s EudraVigilance 
127
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)

  electronic system according to Directive 2001/20/EC, and to all country Regulatory Authorities 
where the study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations.  
The following d escribes the safety reporting timeline requirements for suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) and other reportable events:  
Immediately and within 7 calendar days  
• Any suspected adverse reaction that is associated with the use of the study drug, 
unexpected, and fatal or life threatening.  Follow -up information must be reported in 
the following 8 days.  
Immediately and within 15 calendar days  
• Any suspected adverse reaction that is associated with the use of the study drug, 
unexpected, and serious, but not fatal or life threatening, and there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the reaction.  
• Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggest a significant risk for human 
patients including reports of  mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.  
• Any event in connection with the conduct of the study or the development of the 
study drug that may affect the safety of the trial patients.  
In addition, periodic safety reporting to regulatory authorities  will be performed by the Sponsor 
or its representative according to national and local regulations.  
7.5.6.5.  Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
SUSARs will be reported to the Institutional Review Board  (IRB)/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) per their institutional policy by the Investigator or Sponsor (or Sponsor 
designee) according to country requirements.  Copies of each report and documentation of 
IRB/IEC notification and acknowledgement of receipt  will be kept in the Investigator’s study 
file. 
7.5.6.6.  Pregnancy Reporting  
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the course of this study through 90 days following 
the last dose of study drug, the Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or des ignee 
within 24 hours of being notified of the pregnancy.  Details of the pregnancy will be recorded on 
the pregnancy reporting form.  The patient should receive any necessary counseling regarding 
the risks of continuing the pregnancy and the possible effe cts on the fetus.  
The pregnancy should be followed by the Investigator until completion.  At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy.  If the outcome of the 
pregnancy results in a postpartum complication , spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
or congenital anomaly, then the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE 
as outlined in Section  7.5.6.3 .

  7.5.6.7.  Overdose Reporting  
An overdose is defined as any dose administered to or taken by a patient (accidentally or 
intentionally) that exceeds the highest daily dose, or is at a higher frequency, than included in the 
protocol.  It  is up to the investigator to decide whether a dose is to be considered an overdose, in 
consultation with the Sponsor.  Overdose must be recorded in the eCRF.  
All reports of overdose (with or without an AE) must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor 
or designee.   
7.6. Exploratory Assessments  
Blood and urine samples will be collected for exploratory analyses.  Aliquots of samples will be 
obtained and frozen, to permit future analysis of the effect of ALN -AS1 on exploratory 
biomarkers.   
Where local regulations allow, biologic samples will be retained on behalf of the Sponsor for a 
maximum of 15 years following the last patient’s last visit in the study.  Details regarding the 
collection, processing, storage, and shipping of samples will be in the Lab oratory Manual.  
7.7. Other Assessments  
7.7.1.  EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire  
QOL will be assessed through the use of the 5 -level EQ -5D (EQ -5D-5L), a standardized 
questionnaire measuring health outcomes. (36)  In addit ion to the time points indicated, the 
EQ-5D-5L questionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a 
porphyria attack (but, not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible.  
7.8. COVID -19 Data Collection  
Information on the co ronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) infection status of the patient, if 
known, and other information on the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on the patient's 
participation in the study will be collected.  
8. STATISTICS

written approval before he or she can enroll any patient into the study.  
The Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB or IEC of any amendment to the protocol 
in accordance with local requirements.  In addition, the IRB or IEC must ap prove all patient 
materials for the study (except those that support the need to remove an apparent immediate 
hazard to the patient) .  The protocol must be reapproved by the IRB or IEC upon receipt of 
amendments and annually, as local regulations require.  
Initial IRB approval of the protocol, and all materials approved by the IRB for this study 
including the patient consent form and recruitment materials must be maintained by the 
Investigator and made available for inspection.  
The Investigator will submit r eports of SAEs as outlined in Section  7.5.6 .  In addition, the 
Investigator agrees to submit progress reports to the IRB or IEC per their local repor ting 
requirements, or at least annually and at the conclusion of the study.  The reports will be made 
available to the Sponsor or designee.  
Any communications from regulatory agencies in regard to inspections, other studies that impact 
this protocol or the  qualifications of study personnel should be promptly reported to the Sponsor 
or its designee.

  The Investigator is also responsible for providing the IRB with reports of any reportable serious 
adverse drug reactions from any other study conducted with the investigational drug.  The 
Sponsor or designee will provide this information to the Investigator.  
Major changes in this research activity, except those to remove an apparent immediate hazard to 
the patient, must be reviewed and approved by the Sponsor and the IRB or IEC that approved the 
study.  Amendments to the protocol must be submitted in writing to the Investigator’s IRB or 
IEC and the Regulatory Authority for approval before patients are enrolled under the amended 
protocol.  
9.1.3.  Serious Breach of Protocol  
Investigators must notify the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of becoming aware of a potential 
serious breach of the protocol.  A serious breach is a breach that is likely to affect to a significant 
degree the safety and rights of a study participant or th e reliability and robustness of the data 
generated in the clinical trial.  
9.1.4.  Study Documentation, Confidentiality, and Records Retention  
All documentation relating to the study should be retained for the period of time required by 
applicable local law.  If it  becomes necessary for the Sponsor, the Sponsor’s designee, applicable 
IRB/IEC, or applicable regulatory authorities to review or audit any documentation relating to 
the study, the Investigator must permit direct access to all source documents/data.  Recor ds will 
not be destroyed without informing the Sponsor in writing and giving the Sponsor the 
opportunity to store the records for a longer period of time at the Sponsor’s expense.   
The Investigator must ensure that the patients’ confidentiality will be ma intained.  On the CRFs 
or other documents submitted to the Sponsor or designees, patients should not be identified by 
their names, but by the assigned patient number and initials.  If patient names are included on 
copies of documents submitted to the Spons or or designees, the names (except for initials) will 
be obliterated and the assigned patient number added to the document.  Documents not for 
submission to the Sponsor (eg, signed ICFs) should be maintained by the Investigator in strict 
confidence.  
The In vestigator must treat all of the information related to the study and the compiled data as 
confidential, whose use is for the purpose of conducting the study.  The Sponsor must approve 
any transfer of information not directly involved in the study.  
In comp liance with local and/or regional regulations, this clinical study may be registered and 
study results may be posted on public registries, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.  
9.1.5.  End of the Study  
The end of the study is defined as last patient last visit.  
9.1.6.  Discontinuation of the Clinical Study  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study for clinical or administrative reasons at 
any time.  If the clinical study center does not recruit at a reasonable rate, the study may be 
discontinued at that cli nical study center.  Should the study be terminated and/or the clinical 
study center closed for whatever reason, all documentation and study drug pertaining to the study 
133
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 7, 29 April 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  58 
  must be returned to the Sponsor or its representative, and the Investigators, IEC/IRB and 
Regulatory Authorities will be promptly informed of the termination and the reason for the 
decision.  The Investigator should promptly inform the patients and assure appropriate therapy 
and follow -up.  Patients should then be withdrawn from the study.   
9.2. Data Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
9.2.1.  Data Handling  
Study data must be recorded on case report forms (paper and/or electronic) provided by the 
Sponsor or designee on behalf of the Sponsor.  Case report forms must be completed only by 
persons designa ted by the Investigator.  If eCRFs are used, study data must be entered by trained 
clinical study center personnel with access to a valid and secure eCRF system.  All data entered 
into the eCRF must also be available in the source documents.  Corrections o n paper CRFs must 
be made so as to not obliterate the original data and must be initialed and dated by the person 
who made the correction.  
9.2.2.  Study Monitoring  
The clinical monitor, as a representative of the Sponsor, has an obligation to closely follow the 
study conduct at the clinical study center.  The monitor will visit the Investigator and clinical 
study center periodically and will maintain frequent telephone and written contact.  The monitor 
will maintain current personal knowledge of the study through o bservation, review of study 
records and source documentation, and discussion of the conduct of the study with the 
Investigator and personnel.  
The monitor will review source documents, systems and CRFs to ensure overall quality and 
completeness of the data and to confirm study procedures are complied with the requirements in 
the study protocol.  The Sponsor, or its designee, will be allowed to conduct clinical study center 
visits to the investigation facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the  study.  The 
Investigator agrees to allow the monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug 
accountability records, patient charts and study source documents, and other records relative to 
study conduct.  
9.2.3.  Audits and Inspections  
Periodically, the Sponsor or its authorized representatives audit clinical investigative study 
centers as an independent review of core trial processes and documents to determine whether 
these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, an d accurately reported 
according to the protocol, GCP guidelines of the ICH, and any applicable regulatory 
requirements.  A regulatory authority, an IEC or an IRB may visit the clinical study center to 
perform audits or inspections, including source data ve rification.  The Investigator should contact 
the Sponsor, or its designee, immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency about an 
inspection.  
9.3. Publication Policy  
It is intended that after completion of the study, the data are to be submitted for publicati on in a 
scientific journal and/or for reporting at a scientific meeting.  A copy of any proposed manuscript 
must be provided and confirmed received at the Sponsor at least 30 days before its submission, 
and according to any additional publication details i n the Investigator Agreement .

Notes:   
• White boxes represent visits to the clinical study center or when patients will be contacted by phone; grey boxe s represent study visit 
that may be conducted while the patient is at home.  
• When scheduled at the same time points, assessments of vital signs and 12 -lead ECGs should be performed first, before the physical 
examinations and blood/urine sample collections.  
a Patients are not required to complete Screening/Baseline assessments if the assessments in the previous study (ALN -AS1-001) were completed within 
60 days of administration of the first dose of ALN -AS1 in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed since the last assessment, clinical laboratory 
tests and ECGs will be repeated before administration of ALN -AS1.  Results should be available and deemed acceptable before the administration of 
the first dose of ALN -AS1.  
b After a patient has completed 6 mo nths of ALN -AS1 administration in this study, and where applicable country and local regulations and 
infrastructure allow, study procedures, including ALN -AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional.  Study 
procedu res may occur at the patient’s home at the discretion of the Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, patient s are required to 
complete at least 1 visit at the clinical study center Q3M through M12, and thereafter Q6M. Additional visits to collect clinical laboratory samples 
may occur at home at any point during the treatment period, within 14 days prior to scheduled dose administration.  
c See Section  7.1 for details on the interval medical history/disease history to be recorded at Screening/Baseline.  Ongoing AEs from the previ ous study 
(ALN -AS1-001) will be captured as medical history.

  d A complete physical examination will be perform ed at Screening/Baseline, and D1.  At all other visits, a targeted physical examination will be 
performed.  On dosing days, the physical examination will be performed predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, the physical 
examination can occur at  any time during the visit.  See Section  7.5.3  for details on the physical examination.  
e Height will be measured at Screening/Baseline only.  
f Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate.  On D1, vital signs will be collected  within 1 hour predose; and 2 
hours (±10 minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not 
administered, vital signs can be collected at any time during the visit.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supin e position (should be 
consistent for each patient), after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  
g Using central ECG equipment, triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine position after the patient has rested comfortably for at 
least 5 minutes.  For patients receiving ≤2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1 ECGs will be performed wit hin 1 hour predose and 2 hours (±15 minutes) postdose at a 
minimum of 2 of the following visits:  D1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 15 (only if visit is done at clinic), o r Month 18.  In patients 
receiving >2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1, ECGs will be perf ormed within 1 hour predose and 4 hours (±20 minutes) postdose at a minimum of two of the 
following visits:  D1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 15 (only if visit is done at clinic), or Month 18.  On all other dosing days, ECGs 
will be collected  within 1 hour predose (see Section  7.5.4   for ECG assessment details).  
h Clinical laboratory parameters are described in Section  7.5.5 .  On dosing days, blood samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected 
predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, blood samples can be co llected at any time during the visit. On dosing days up to the Month 18 
visit,results from hematology, chemistry (including LFTs), and coagulation tests collected within the prior 14 days must be r eviewed by the 
Investigator before study drug administratio n.  If results from within the prior 14 days are not available at a dosing visit (at visits from D1 to Month 
18), locally analyzed predose assessments may be used for review in order to allow same day study drug administration, and ad ditional samples for 
central analysis must also be collected.  
i A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening/Baseline; thereafter, urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  Results  must be available before 
dosing.  
j ALN -AS1 will be administered by SC injection accordin g to the Pharmacy Manual.  See Section  6.2.2  for ALN -AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  For 
weight -based dosing, weight measured at the current study cen ter visit (dosing day) will be used to calculate the dose of ALN -AS1.  After M12, 
weight measured at either the previous study center visit or on current study center visit will be used to calculate the weig ht-based dose of ALN -AS1.  
k Spot urine samples wi ll be collected for measurement of ALA, PBG, and creatinine levels.  On dosing days, samples should be collected predose.  
l On dosing days, blood and urine samples for ALAS1 mRNA (and possible biomarker) analysis will be collected within 1 hour pred ose. 
m Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points listed in Table  4 (Appendix Section  11.1).  Blood sample collection for PK analysis 
at Month 9 and Month 15 is only necessary if ECG will be performed at same visit.  
n On dosing days, blood samples for antidrug antibody analysis sho uld be collected within 1 hour predose.  
o Porphyria attack laboratory sample collection kits should be dispensed at the screening visit along with instructions for use . For any attack that occurs 
through M37, urine samples should be collected within 24 hou rs of the start of clinical intervention (eg, hemin or glucose administration) and within 
24 hours of the end of clinical intervention.  If patients are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyr ia attack, laboratory sample 
collection k its should be used for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center, if possible.  These urine samples m ay also be 
analyzed for exploratory biomarkers.  
p In addition to the time points indicated, the EQ -5D-5L questionnaire should be co mpleted once during the treatment period if a patient has a porphyria 
attack (but not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  1 ALN -AS1-002 PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT 7  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES D ATED 29 APRIL 2020  
A Multicenter, Open -label Extension Study to Evaluate the Long -term Safety and Clinical 
Activity of Subcutaneously Administered ALN AS1 in Patients with Acute Intermittent 
Porphyria who have Completed a Previous Clinical Study with ALN -AS1 
1. RATIONALE FOR PROTOC OL AMENDMENT  
The purpose of this protocol amendment is to incorporate Urgent Safety Measures (US Ms) that 
were communicated to investigators in a Dear Investigator Letter to assure the safety of study 
participants while minimizing risks to study integrity amid the COVID -19 pandemic. These 
changes are in line with guidance from both the European Medici nes Agency and the United 
States Food and Drug Administration on the conduct of clinical trials during the COVID -19 
pandemic .[EMA 2020; FDA 2020 ] 
The USM modifications and new procedures are outlined below, and a detailed summ ary of the 
specific protocol changes  is provided in Section  2. These changes should be adopted 
immediately per the Dear Investigator Letter  dated 07 A pril 2020 . 
• ALN -AS1 (givosiran) Dosing Outside the Study Center by Patient or Caregiver  
Following appropriate training on ALN -AS1 administration and the use of 
epinephrine (epi pen or equivalent), dosing will be permitted at a location other than 
the study center (eg, at home) by the patient or caregiver at all time points under the 
oversight of the Investigator and following consultation with the medical monitor .  
This measure  is intended to remain in effect only during periods of time when the 
COVID -19 pan demic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the study site or 
healthcare professionals to go to patients' homes for dosing.  
ALN -AS1-002 is a dedicated open -label extension study.  One patient in the 
ALN -AS1-002 study had an anaphylactic reaction within minutes of receiving her 3rd 
dose of givosiran and was successfully treated with epinephrine. This patient 
discontinued from the study. To date, all current study patients have been stable on 
treatment with givosiran for a median duration of 36 mont hs, with monthly dosing 
occurring both at the study site and offsite by home healthcare professionals.  
Detailed instructions and procedures related to administration of givosiran by a 
patient or caregiver will be provided in the Patient/Caregiver Storage and 
Administration Instructions.  
• Study Visit Window  
Except for assessments with other specified timing requirements, study assessments 
and dosing are to be performed within a visit window of ±14 days (previously 
±7 days). Study drug doses must be administe red at least 14 days apart , and this is 
expected to be tolerated based on safety data from the Phase 1 study ( ALN -AS1-001), 
which evaluated dosing at 5.0 mg/kg monthly (twice the therapeutic dose of 
2.5◦mg/kg monthly) . 
151
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 7 Summary of Changes, 29 April 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  2 • Assessments of Adverse Events, Concom itant Medications (including hemin use), 
Hospitalizations/Procedures, and Porphyria Attacks  
In situations where a study visit cannot be completed at the study center or offsite by 
a healthcare professional visit, the study Investigator (or delegate) may ve rbally 
contact the patient within the study visit window to assess for any adverse events 
(AEs), concomitant medications (including hemin use), hospitalizations/procedures, 
and porphyria attacks.  
• Time Period to Obtain Weight for Dose Determination  
Dose wil l be based on weight obtained within 6 months (previously at the current or 
prior study visit) prior to dosing.  Dosing weight may be collected during clinical 
study center visits or offsite.  
Given the expanded use of offsite administration, use of a prior  weight permits 
accurate determination of dose and volume without manual calculations or verbal 
orders.  All patients are adult; therefore, substantial fluctuations in body weight over a 
6-month  period are not expected.  Prior analyses of the study data ha ve shown mean 
body weight to be stable over time.  
• EQ-5D-5L Assessments  
In situations where a planned study visit cannot be completed at the study center, the 
patient will complete the 5 -level EQ -5D (EQ -5D-5L) questionnaire at home.  
• Assessment of ECG  
Further assessment of ECG is no longer warranted, because no clinically significant 
ECG findings, including QT interval prolongation, have been observed following 
comprehensive analyses across ALN -AS1-002 and the Phase 3 study ALN -AS1-003 
to date.  To  minimize exposure to COVID -19, decrease the burden on patients and 
trial sites, and align with the US and EU prescribing information, which do not 
require ECG assessment for dosing, ECGs are no longer required  in this study .  For 
further information, refer to the givosiran (ALN -AS1) Investigator’s Brochure.  
• Assessments Required to be Performed at Study Center Visits  
Where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow for home 
healthcare, healthcare may take place at a location other than the  clinical trial site to 
perform study assessments including targeted physical exam/body system assessment, 
assessments for vital signs, and collection of blood and urine samples for safety 
laboratory assessments, and PD assessments, at all timepoints as sp ecified in the 
Schedule of Assessments.  
• Antidrug Antibody Assessments Required to be Performed at Study Center 
Visits  
Given the expanded use of offsite dosing, a ntidrug antibody (ADA) assessments that 
cannot be collected in the intended visit window may be completed within 6 months 
at the next study  center visit (previously at the clinical study center visit).

Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 7 Summary of Changes, 29 April 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  3 The incidence of ADAs due to ALN -AS1 has been very low across clinical studies of 
ALN -AS1.  There have been no treatment -emergent ADAs in the current study.  In 
the Phase 3 study ALN -AS1-003, there has been only 1 case of treatment -emergent 
ADAs due to ALN -AS1.  The antibody titer was low and transient, with the patient 
subsequently testing ne gative.  Based on the collective evidence to date, ALN -AS1 is 
considered to have a very low risk of eliciting an immune response.  
• Collection of Information Related to COVID -19 
Information related to the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on patient participat ion 
in the study will be collected for each patient.  Additional information regarding 
collection of this information, including completion of a new case report form

Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 7 Summary of Changes, 29 April 2020  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  4 2. PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 7 DETAILED SUMMARY OF  CHANGES  
The primary section(s) of the protocol affected by the changes in Protocol Amendment 7 are indicated.  The corresponding text  has 
been revised throughout the protocol.  Deleted text is indicated by strikeout  and added text is indicated by bold  font, releva nt to each 
purpose described.  
Purpose:  To expand the use of offsite administration to include ALN-AS1 dosing by the patient or caregiver.  
The primary change occurs in Section 6.2.2, Dose and Administration  
Revised text:  
2nd paragraph  
ALN -AS1 will be administered by a qualified and authorized health care professional trained in the recognition and management of 
anaphylactic reactions.   The study drug should be injected into the abdomen or upper arms or thighs.  Detailed instructions for study 
drug admi nistration are presented in the Pharmacy Manual. As is consistent with good medical practice for subcutaneous drug 
administration, patients will be observed for a minimum of 20 minutes after each injection.   Treatment for anaphylactic reac tions 
should be readily available where patients are being dosed, and follow country and/or local hospital treatment guidelines as shown in  
Table 8 (33).  
3rd paragraph  
ALN -AS1 will be administered by a qualified and authorized health care professional trained in the recog nition and 
management of anaphylactic reactions.   After a patient has completed 12 months of ALN -AS1 administration in this study 
(6 months in an every month dosing regimen),  study drug administration may be conducted at a location other than the study cen ter by 
a home healthcare professional, where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, after consultation w ith the 
medical monitor, during particular study visits, as specified in the Schedules of Assessments .  If the patient is un able to come to the 
study site, and a visit by a home healthcare professional is not possible due to circumstances related to the COVID -19 
pandemic, ALN -AS1 may be administered by the patient or the caregiver under the oversight of the Investigator, and 
following consultation with the medical monitor, as allowed by applicable country and local regulations.  In such cases, the 
patient or caregiver must receive appropriate training on ALN -AS1 administration and the use of epinephrine (epi pen or 
equivalent) p rior to dosing.  This measure is intended to remain in effect only during periods of time when the COVID -19 
pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the study site or healthcare professionals to go to patients' homes for  
dosing.   However, stud y drug administration at the study center should be considered for patients who have ongoing study drug -
related AEs or known risk factors for developing anaphylactic reaction, including but not limited to: a prior history of anap hylactic 
reaction to food, medications or due to unknown etiology, worsening injection site reactions with repeat dosing, or anyone in the

visit a t the clinical study center every 3 months for the first year, and thereafter every 6 months through the end of the treatment  
period.   Additional visits to collect c linical laboratory samples may occur at home at any point during the treatment period, with in 14 
days prior to scheduled dose administration.  
Last paragraph:  
Detailed instructions for study drug administration are found in the Pharmacy Manual .  In addition, instructions and procedures 
related to administration of ALN -AS1 by a patient or caregive r will be provided in the Patient/Caregiver Storage and 
Administration Instructions.

Study Design  
This is a multicenter, open -label extension study to evaluate the long -term safety and clinical activity 
of ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP  who completed study ALN -AS1-001. 
The last assessments performed, determining previous study (ALN -AS1-001) completion, will serve as 
the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed since the last 
assessment, safety asse ssments will be repeated before administration of ALN -AS1.  It is anticipated 
that patients will begin ALN -AS1 administration in this study within 6 months after the last dose of 
study drug in the previous study.  Eligibility will be confirmed before admin istration of the first dose of 
ALN -AS1 (Day 1).  Patients will undergo assessments at the clinical study center every month for the 
first 3 months.  Then, through Month 6, and according to the dosing regimen selected, assessments will 
take place at the cli nical study center or via a phone contact (for an every month dosing regimen, visits 
will be every month; for an every 3 months dosing regimen, visits will be every 3 months).  After a 
patient has completed 12 months of ALN -AS1 administration in this study  (6 months in an every 
month dosing regimen), and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, 
study procedures, including ALN -AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s home by a 
healthcare professional.  Study procedu res may occur at the patient’s home at the discretion of the 
Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit 
at the clinical study center every 3 months for the first year, and thereafter every 6 months through the 
end of the treatment period.  Additional visits to collect clinical laboratory samples may occur at home 
at any point during the treatment period, within 14 days prior to scheduled dose administration.  
Patients will return to the clinic al study center for a posttreatment follow -up visit after administration 
of the last dose of ALN -AS1.  An ALA/PBG Monitoring/EOS visit will be conducted either at the 
clinical study center or via phone contact, unless treatment continues with ALN -AS1.  
Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain assessments, 
and narcotic use.  Patients will also be provided with laboratory sample collection kits and instructions 
for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center.  
Patients may receive ALN -AS1 as long as they do not fulfill any of the study discontinuation criteria or 
until ALN -AS1 is commercially available in the patient’s territory or the ALN -AS1 development 
program is discontinued (whichever  comes first).  
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review safety and tolerability data collected during the study 
with the primary purpose of protecting the safety of patients participating in the study.  
Number of Planned Patients  
Up to 24 patients are p lanned for enrollment in this study (including optional cohorts in 
ALN -AS1-001). 
Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria  
Patients with AIP, who have completed Part C of study ALN -AS1-001, will be eligible for screening in 
this study.  Eligible patients wi ll not be on a scheduled regimen of hemin to prevent porphyria attacks 
at Screening.  Patients with alanine transaminase ≥2.0× upper limit of normal, total bilirubin ≥2 mg/dL 
(unless bilirubin elevation is due to Gilbert’s syndrome), or estimated glomerula r filtration rate ≤30 
mL/min/1.73 m2 (using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) at Screening are not 
eligible for this study.

 6 ALN -AS1 Solution for Injection (subcutaneous use [SC]) is comprised of a synthetic, small interfering 
RNA targeting ALAS1 and bearing a triantennary N -acetyl galactosamine ligand conjugated to the 
sense strand, formulated in phosphate buffer.  
The study starting dose and regimen of ALN -AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg as an SC  injection administered every 3 
months.  Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may approve changes to the dosing regimen, 
including decreases in the dose level and changes in the dosing frequency.  However any dose and 
dosing regimen will not exceed a p reviously explored dose level or frequency that was determined to 
be safe and well -tolerated in study ALN -AS1-001, SRC, Health Authority and Ethics Committee 
approval must be sought prior to dose escalation above 5.0 mg/kg in accordance with local Regulato ry 
requirements.  
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Not applicable  
Duration of Treatment and Study  
The duration of treatment is up to 48 months .  The estimated total time on study, inclusive of 
Screening/Baseline, for each patient is up  to 56 months.  
Statistical Methods  
Statistical analyses will be primarily descriptive.  Incidence of AEs will be summarized by maximum 
severity and relationship to ALN -AS1.  Incidence of and serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs 
leading to discontinuation  will also be tabulated.  By -patient listings will be provided for deaths, SAEs, 
and events leading to discontinuation.  
Laboratory shift tables from baseline to worst values will be presented.  Abnormal physical 
examination findings and electrocardiogram data will be presented in by -patient listings.  Descriptive 
statistics will be provided for electrocardiogram interval data and presented as both actual values and 
changes from baseline relative to each on study evaluation and to the last evaluation on -study. 
Clinical activity of ALN -AS1 will be summarized primarily by descriptive statistics.  The clinical 
activity of ALN -AS1 will be evaluated by the frequency and characteristics of porphyria attacks 
including duration, treatment, and severity of porphyria attacks and number and duration of visits to a 
health care setting for acute porphyria care.  Patient diary recordings, including BPI -SF questionnaire 
scores, will also be summarized.   
PD analysis will include the evaluation of change in ALA, PBG, and ALA S mRNA levels.  Descriptive 
statistics (eg, mean and standard error of the mean) for observed levels of PD parameters and the 
relative change from baseline will be presented for each of the postdose follow -up time points.  
The PK concentration of ALN -AS1 wi ll be determined.  Antidrug antibody results will be tabulated 
overall and by previous treatment in the previous study (ALN -AS1-001).  A by -patient listing will also 
be provided.  
Additional exploratory analyses may be conducted on analytes related to targe ting the heme 
biosynthesis pathway.  Quality of life scores will also be summarized.

Notes:   
 White boxes represent visits to the clinical study center or when patients will be contacted by phone; grey boxes represent s tudy visit that may 
be conducted while the patient is at home.  
 When scheduled at the same time points, assessments of vital signs and 12 -lead ECGs should be performed first, before the physical 
examinations and blood/urine sample collections.  
a Patients are not required to complete Screening/Baseline assessments if the assessments in the previous study (ALN -AS1-001) were completed within 60 days 
of administration of the first dose of ALN -AS1 in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed since the last assessment, clinica l laboratory tests and ECGs 
will be repeated before administration of ALN -AS1.  Results should be available and deemed acceptable before the administration of the first dose of ALN -
AS1.  On Day 1, results from hematology, chemistry (including LFTs), and co agulation tests collected within the prior 14 days must be reviewed by the

9 Investigator before study drug administration.  If results from within the prior 14 days are not available at a dosing visit,  locally analyzed predose assessments 
may be used for re view in order to allow same day study drug administration and additional samples for central analysis must also be collected.  
b After a patient has completed 12 months of ALN -AS1 administration in this study, and where applicable country and local regulati ons and infrastructure allow, 
study procedures, including ALN -AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional.  Study procedures may occur at the 
patient’s home at the discretion of the Investigator, based on safety an d tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical 
study center Q6M.  Additional visits to collect c linical laboratory samples may occur at home at any point during the treatment period, within 14 days prior to 
scheduled dose administration.  
c See Section 7.1 for details on the interval medical history/disease history to be recorded at Screening/Baseline.  Ongoing AEs from the previous study 
(ALN -AS1-001) will be captured as medical history.  
d A complete physical exa mination will be performed at Screening/Baseline, and D1.  At all other visits, a targeted physical examination will be perfo rmed.  On 
dosing days, the physical examination will be performed predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, the physical examination can occur at any time 
during the visit.  See Section  7.5.3  for details on the physical examination.  
e Height will be measured at Screeni ng/Baseline only.  
f Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate.  On D1, vital signs will be collected  within 1 hour predose; and 2 hours 
(±10 minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, vital signs 
can be collected at any time during the visit.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be cons istent for each patient), after the 
patient  has rested comfortably for at least 10 minutes.  
g Using central ECG equipment, triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine position after the patient has rested comfortably for at least 5 
minutes.  For patients receiving ≤2.5 mg/kg A LN-AS1, ECGs will be performed within 1 hour predose and 2 hours (±15 minutes) postdose at a minimum of 2 
of the following visits:  D1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 15 (only if visit is done at clinic), or Month 18.  In patients receiving >2. 5 mg/kg 
ALN -AS1, ECGs will be performed within 1 hour predose and 4 hours (±20 minutes) postdose at a minimum of two of the following vis its:  D1, Month 3, 
Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 15 (only if visit is done at clinic), or Month 18.  On all other d osing days, ECGs will be collected within 1 hour predose 
(see Section  7.5.4  for ECG assessment details).   
h Clinical laboratory parameters are descr ibed in Section  7.5.5 .  On dosing days, blood samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected predose.  On 
days when ALN -AS1 is not adm inistered, blood samples can be collected at any time during the visit. On dosing days, results from hematology, chemistry 
(including LFTs), and coagulation tests collected within the prior 14 days must be reviewed by the Investigator before study drug adm inistration.  If results 
from within the prior 14 days are not available at a dosing visit, locally analyzed predose assessments may be used for revie w in order to allow same day study 
drug administration  and additional samples for central analysis  must  also be collected.  
i A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening/Baseline; thereafter, urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  Results  must be available before dosing.  
j ALN -AS1 will be administered by SC injection according to the Pharmacy Man ual.  See Section  6.2.2  for ALN -AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  For 
weight -based dosing, weight measured at the current study center visit (dosing day)  will be used to calculate the dose of ALN -AS1 through M12.  After M12, 
weight measured at either the previous study center visit or the current study center visit may be used to calculate the weig ht-based dose of ALN -AS1.  
k Spot urine samples will be coll ected for measurement of ALA, PBG, and creatinine levels.  On dosing days, samples should be collected predose.  
l On dosing days, blood and urine samples for ALAS1 mRNA (and possible biomarker) analysis will be collected within 1 hour pred ose. 
m Blood samp les for PK analysis will be collected at the time points listed in  Table  4 (Appendix Section  11.1).  Blood sample collection for PK analysis at 
Month 9 and Month 15 is only necessary if ECG will be performed at same visit.  
n On dosing days, blood samples for antidrug antibody analysis should be collected within 1 hour predose.  
oPorphyria attack laboratory sample collection kits should be dispensed at the screening visit along with instructions for use . For any attack that occurs through
M37, urine samples should be collected within 24 hours of t he start of clinical intervention (eg, hemin or glucose administration) and within 24 hours of the end
of clinical intervention.  If patients are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laborator y sample collection kits wil l be provided

 10 that contain instructions for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center, if possible.  These urine sa mples may also be analyzed for 
exploratory biomarkers.  
p In addition to the time points indicated, the EQ -5D-5L quest ionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a porphyria attack 
(but not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible.  
q Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain ass essments, and narcotic use on a daily basis through M9; 
thereafter, acute porphyria attacks will be recorded in the diary.  The BPI will be completed on a weekly basis as part of th e patient diary through M9, then 
Q3M.  
r Patients will be contacted by phone  to collect AEs and concomitant medications.  Patients will also be reminded to collect and send urine samples to the clinical  
study center, if possible, if they are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack.  
s Medications tha t are ongoing from the previous study (ALN -AS1-001), started between the previous study and this study, and started after signing informed 
consent in this study, will be captured as concomitant medication(s).

24 1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Disease Overview
The porphyrias are a family of rare metabolic disorders predominately caused by a genetic 
mutation in 1 of the 8 enzymes responsible for heme synthesis. (1)  The 2 major categories are 
erythropoietic and hepatic, depending on the major site of expression of the underlying enzyme 
deficiency .(2)  In addition, the porphyrias are classified as acute if patients present with 
neurovisceral symptoms (eg, abdominal pain and neurologic symptoms) or cutaneous if they 
present with dermal blistering or photosensitivity. (3, 4) 
This study will include patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), the most common acute 
hepatic porphyria (AHP).  AIP occurs as a result of an autosomal dominant mutation leading to 
partial deficiency of porphobil inogen deaminase (PBGD), the third enzyme in the heme 
biosynthesis pathway .(5)  The rate limiting step in heme synthesi s is the upstream enzyme 
5-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1), which is controlled by feedback repression via the 
end-product heme.  In response to a decrease in endogenous heme in the liver, as can occur with 
fasting, hormonal alterations, or with cyt ochrome P450 (CYP) inducing drugs, ALAS1 is 
induced, resulting in increased flux through the heme synthesis pathway.  In patients with AIP, 
this can result in the marked accumulation of the toxic heme intermediates porphobilinogen 
(PBG) and delta aminolevu linic acid (ALA) in the blood and urine due to the deficiency in the 
downstream PBGD.  Clinically, this manifests as acute attacks characterized by severe 
abdominal pain, cardiovascular as well as neurologic and psychiatric dysfunction. (6) 
1.1.1.  Epidemiology  
Over 370 mutations have been identified in the PBGD gene, which in most instances result in its 
reduction by approximately 50%.  The exact prevalence of AIP is unknown due to under 
diagnosis, variation by geographic region, and the differences in penetrance observed for the 
different mutations .(2)  However, it is estimated that the prevalence of AIP is 5 to 10 per 100,000 
people in Western countries, while in Sweden it occurs in 1 in 1,000 people due to a founder 
effect associated with the resultant G593A mutation .(7-10)  AIP shows incomplete penetrance 
and on average only 10% to 50% of carriers with a mutation present with clinical symptoms. (11)  
It has been proposed that unknown inherited co -factors, in addition to PBGD mutations, may 
explain why a small percentage of patients present with much more severe disease while the 
majority remain asym ptomatic.  
Patients with AIP present with acute attacks characterized by neurovisceral symptoms and signs 
including severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or less commonly diarrhea, 
hypertension, tachycardia, fever, muscle weakness, as well as neurological (eg, neuropathy, 
seizures) and psychiatric (eg, anxiety and confusion) manifestations .(12)  AIP attacks typically 
start after puberty and can be triggered by exogenous factors such as medications (especially 
barbiturates, sulfonamides, and hydantoins), stress, exogenous hormones, nutritional status, and 
infection.  Clinically active disease is more common in  women, where attacks often occur around 
the menstrual cycle and are likely precipitated by hormonal changes.  
Many AIP patients remain undiagnosed given that the disease is rare and characterized by 
non-specific symptoms (eg, abdominal pain and nausea). (2)  The initial diagnosis involves 
demonstrating elevated urinary PBG (typically 20 -50 × normal reference range) and ALA 
183
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 6 28 May 2019  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  
 25 (typically 5 -20 × normal reference range) when the patient is having acute attack symptoms.  
Once a test is positive for elevated ALA and PBG and porphyria is suspected, genetic testing for 
a PBGD mutation is performed.   
There are 4 main clinical phenotypes  of AIP.  Latent gene carriers have never had an acute attack 
and are biochemically inactive (normal urinary ALA and PBG).  Asymptomatic high excreters 
(ASHE) do not have current acute attacks, but are biochemically active (increased urinary ALA 
and PBG).  The increased levels of ALA and PBG in ASHE patients are lower than those in AIP 
patients during an acute attack, but are still significantly higher than normal reference values. (6-
8)  Sporadic attack patients have infrequent acute attacks.  Recurrent attack patients have ≥4 
attacks per year requiring hospitalization or treatment by a medical professional. (7) 
1.1.2.  Current Management and Unmet Medical Need  
Management of acute attacks often requires hospitalization.  Patients are initially treated with 
support ive care and carbohydrate loading, analgesics and anti -emetics, and removal of known 
precipitating factors. (13)  In patients with moderate to severe attacks, or who fail to respond to 
supportive measures, treatment with intravenous (IV) hemin (daily for 3 -5 days) is commenced.  
Symptoms typical ly begin to improve after 2 to 5 days of hemin treatment, accompanied by a 
lowering of urinary ALA and PBG levels to below or at the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
reference value; however, in some patients attacks can last several weeks, requiring prolonged 
hemin use and hospitalization. (14)  With prolonged and severe attacks, cranial nerve 
involvement can occur, leading to bulbar pa ralysis, respiratory failure, and death .(15) 
Hemin, a blood derived therapy, was approved as Normosang® (heme arginate) in the European 
Union (EU) and as Panhematin® (lyophilised hematin) in the United States (US) in 1999 and 
1983, respectively. (16, 17)  In the EU, heme arginate is indicated for the treatment of acute 
attacks of hepatic porphyria (eg, AIP, variegate porphyria, and hereditary coproporphy ria); 
whereas, in the US lyophilized hemin is limited to the amelioration of recurrent attacks of AIP 
temporally related to the menstrual cycle.  Approval of both products was based on biochemical 
efficacy (ie, lowering of ALA and PBG) as well as data from  uncontrolled case series and case 
reports .(18-22)  Hemin side effects include thrombophlebitis, transient anticoagulation, and in 
rare cases, anaphylaxis or renal failure .(22-24)  In addition, hemin administration requires a large 
vein for administration, often necessitating central venous access.  
While the majority of patients who experience attacks have them sporadically, it is estimated that 
up to 1,000 AIP patients experience recurrent attacks (typically defined as ≥4 per year) in the US  
and EU combined .(25)  While hemin is currently only approved to ameliorate acute attacks, it is 
administered prophyla ctically in some patients with recurrent attacks (eg, administered every 1 -2 
weeks). (26)  Potential problems associated with c hronic hemin administration include infusion 
site phlebitis, iron overload, and the need for chronic IV access and associated complications (eg, 
risk of infection or occlusion). (5)  In addition, there have been reports of a decrease in efficacy 
with chronic hemin administration, as evidenced by the need to increase the frequency or dosage 
of hemin prophylaxis over time in attempt to maintain a clinical effect. (27)  In patients with very 
severe recurrent attacks, or  in whom hemin treatment is not effective, liver transplantation can be 
curative; however, organ transplantation is a high -risk procedure and is rarely used as a treatment 
option .  Given the significant morbidity and mortality, there remains a significant unmet need for 
184

Amendment 6 28 May 2019  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  
 26 an efficacious, simple, fast -acting and better tolerated treatment for acute or prevent recurrent 
attacks in patients with AIP.  
1.2. RNA Interference  
RNA interference (RNAi) is a naturally occurring cellular mechanism mediated by small 
interferin g RNAs (siRNAs) for regulating gene expression.  Typically, synthetic siRNAs are 19 
to 25 base pair double stranded oligonucleotides in a staggered duplex with a 2 -nucleotide 
overhang at both or 1 of the 3’ ends .(28)  Such siRNAs can be designed to target an endogenou s 
messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript of a given gene.  When introduced into cells, the net effect 
of an RNAi -based pharmacological approach is the binding of the siRNA to its complementary 
mRNA sequence, cleavage of this target mRNA, and reduction of synthesi s of the target protein, 
resulting in a decrease of the target protein levels. (29)  The ability to selectively and potently 
degrade the mRNA encoding the ALAS1 protein (thereby decreasing accumulation of the toxic 
intermediates ALA and PBG) using an siRNA is a novel approach for the prevention and 
treatment of acute attacks in patients with AIP.   
1.3. ALN -AS1 
ALN -AS1 (givosiran) comprises a synthetic siRNA covalently linked to a GalNAc containing 
ligand (ALN60519), specific for ALAS1  and formulated for administration via subcutaneous 
(SC) injection. ALN -60519 has a target region between nucleotide 918 to 937 of the ALAS1 
mRNA. Attachment to a triantennary GalNAc ligand to the siRNA enables its distribution to the 
liver (which is the p rimary site of ALAS1 synthesis), followed by intracellular delivery to 
hepatocytes via ASGPR, resulting in engagement of the RNAi pathway and suppression of 
hepatic ALAS1 protein synthesis.  
ALN -AS1 is currently in development for treatment of acute attacks  in patients with AIP, the 
most common AHP.  
Further information on ALN -AS1, including the clinical and nonclinical experience to date, is 
available in in the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
1.4. Study Design Rationale  
This is a multicenter,  open -label extension study designed to evaluate the long -term safety and 
clinical activity of subcutaneously administered ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP who have 
completed clinical study ALN -AS1-001.  The primary endpoint for the study is the incidence of 
AEs. 
1.5. Dose Rationale  
Clinical data from Part A and Part B of the ongoing study ALN -AS1-001 demonstrate that single 
(0.035 -2.5 mg/kg) and multiple (0.35 -1.0 mg/kg) doses of ALN -AS1 have been generally 
well-tolerated in patients with AIP who are ASHE.  Additio nally, data from this study indicate 
that a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1 results in near normalization of urine ALA and PBG 
levels, which is sustained for approximately 14 weeks.   
Patients in Part C of the ongoing study ALN -AS1-001 who are eligible fo r participation in this 
study will likely require a higher dose of ALN -AS1 to normalize ALA and PBG as they have 
185
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 6 28 May 2019  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  
 27 higher levels of ALAS1 upregulation and higher baseline levels of ALA and PBG, when 
compared to patients with AIP who are ASHE. (30)  For example, based on preliminary data i n 
Part A and Part B of the ALN -AS1-001 study, the mean PBG level of patients who are ASHE is 
21.9 mmol/mol Cr (N=28); whereas, in Part C of this study in patients with AHP who have 
recurrent porphyria attacks, the mean PBG level is approximately 49.3 mmol/ mol Cr (N=12).  
The study starting dose and regimen of ALN -AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg as an SC injection administered 
every 3 months.  Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may approve changes to the ALN -
AS1 dosing regimen, including decreases in the dose level an d changes in dosing frequency.  
However, any dosing regimen will not exceed a previously explored dose level or frequency that 
was determined to be safe and well -tolerated in study ALN -AS1-001. SRC, Health Authority and 
Ethics Committee approval must be so ught prior to dose level escalation above 5.0 mg/kg in 
accordance with local Regulatory requirements.  
The study starting dose and regimen was selected based on the benefit:risk profile of ALN -AS1 
in Part C of the ongoing ALN -AS1-001 study.  Preliminary dat a to date indicate that 
administration of 5.0 mg/kg ALN -AS1 has been generally well -tolerated.  There have been no 
study drug -related serious adverse events ( SAEs ), severe AEs, or clinically significant changes in 
safety parameters.  While a single 2.5 mg/kg dose of ALN -AS1 has also been generally well -
tolerated when administered to patients in Part A and Part C of study ALN -AS1-001, this dose 
has not resulted in near normalization of ALA and PBG levels.  In addition, while emerging data 
from Part C indi cate that an every 3 months dose of 2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1 demonstrated some 
clinical activity (eg, decrease in attack frequency and decrease in heme use), some patients 
continued to experience breakthrough porphyria attacks during the treatment period, indicat ing 
that a higher dose may be required.  
The duration of dosing in this study is supported by the overall favorable safety profile of 
ALN -AS1 in the ongoing clinical study ALN -AS1-001 and the absence of new findings in 
nonclinical studies with ALN -AS1.  
1.6. Clinical Data Summary  
1.6.1.  Clinical Pharmacodynamics  
Dosing has been completed in Part A and Part B of the study.  In both Parts A and B of the study, 
durable and dose -dependent reductions of ALAS1 mRNA (up to 66% in the 2.5 mg/kg dose 
group) as measured by cERD  were observed after ALN -AS1 treatment.  ALAS1 reductions were 
highly correlated with reductions in ALA (mean maximal 86%) PBG (mean maximal 95%) 
levels in a dose -dependent manner and were sustained for ≥180 days.  
Dosing is currently ongoing in Part C of the study. The mean maximal reduction in ALAS1 
mRNA  relative to baseline in ALN -AS1-treated patients in Cohort 1 (2.5 mg/kg Q3M) was 39% 
and in Cohort 2 (2.5 mg/kg Q1M) 66%.  All patients treated with ALN -AS1 also had decreases 
in their peak ALA and PBG le vels in the treatment period compared to the run -in period, along 
with reduced fluctuations in these levels in the treatment period ( data not shown) . No reductions 
were observed in the placebo -treated patients.

 28 1.6.2.  Clinical Activity  
Clinical activity was not evaluated in Parts A and B of the study because ASHE patients included 
in this study were not actively experiencing attacks of porphyria.  
Dosing is currently ongoing in Part C of the study. All patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 were enrolled 
in a run -in phase fo r 10-15 weeks that was followed by a treatment phase for up to 24 weeks.  No 
investigational product was administered during the run -in phase.  Therefore, each patient acted 
as their own control, allowing for individual ALA / PBG levels, and overall attack  rate while on 
ALN -AS1 treatment to be compared to that observed in the run -in phase.   
Figure  1 shows in Cohort 1 ALN -AS1-treated patients there was a 74% mean decrease in the 
annualized attack rate for the treatment period versus the run -in period (range: 63 -94% 
reduction), compared with a 23% decrease in the annualized attack rate for the placebo -treated 
patient.  In ALN -AS1-treated patients this was a ccompanied by an approximate 76% mean 
decrease in annualized acute hemin usage (range 52 -95%) and a 10.3 times increase in the 
maximal attack free interval compared to run -in period (range 4.2 -16.3).

Run-in 
 
Figure  2 shows in Cohort 2 ALN -AS1-treated patients, there was a 58% mean decrease in the 
annualized attack rate for the treatment period versus the run -in period (range: 45 -76% 
reduction).  This comp ares favorably with data from the placebo -treated patient who showed a 
34% reduction in the annualized attack rate for the treatment period versus the run -in period.  In 
ALN -AS1-treated patients, the reduction in attack rate was accompanied by a 92% mean 
decrease in annualized hemin usage (range 84 -100%) and a 2.7x increase in the mean maximal 
attack free interval compared to run -in period (range 2.1 -3.2).

1.6.3.  Clinical Safety  
In Part A and Part B of Study ALN -AS1-001, a total of 11 patients (11/13; 85.0%) who received 
ALN -AS1 reported at least 1 AE.  All 5 placebo -treated patients (5/5; 100%) reported at least 1 
AE.  AEs considered  possibly or definitely related to ALN -AS1 were reported in 5 patients 
(5/13; 38%): diarrhoea, dyspepsia, hematochezia, injection site erythema, injection site pain, 
blood creatinine increased, glomerular filtration rate decreased, and hypoesthesia (each A E 
reported only by an individual patient; 1/13; 8% each).  There were 2 SAEs of abdominal pain: 1 
patient each in the 0.035 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg ALN -AS1 dose groups.  Both were considered to 
be not related and resolved without sequelae.  There were no AEs l eading to discontinuation.  All 
AEs were mild or moderate in severity, except for 1 of the SAEs of abdominal pain (0.10 mg/kg 
dose group), which was considered severe. Adverse events related to abnormal laboratory values 
were seen in 1 patient in the 0.35 mg/kg ALN -AS1 dose group who had AEs of ALT increased 
and AST increased, which were moderate and considered by the Investigator to be unrelated to 
ALN -AS1.  No clinically significant findings were observed with routine monitoring of CRP and 
a panel of 9 pr oinflammatory cytokines collected predose and up to 24 hours post -dose.  There 
were no other clinically significant laboratory abnormalities related to study drug or changes in 
vital signs, or ECGs in patients who were administered ALN AS1 or placebo.  
Dosi ng is ongoing in Part C of the study. All patients who received ALN -AS1 in cohort 1 and 2 
reported at least 1 AE.  AEs that were reported in at least 2 subjects were nausea in 3 patients 
(50%) and abdominal pain, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, headache, cough and oropharyngeal pain 
in 2 patients (33.3%) each.  All AEs were mild or moderate in severity.  AEs considered possibly 
or definitely related to ALN -AS1 were reported in 4 patients (66.6%), 1 each:  renal impairment 
in Cohort 1 and injection site reaction,  myalgia, and headache in Cohort 2. Both placebo -treated 
patients reported AEs.  No AE was experienced in more than 1 patient.  
In Part C, Cohort 1 or 2, there were no SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation in patients 
administered ALN -AS1 or placebo. No c linically significant laboratory abnormalities related to 
study drug or changes in vital signs, ECG, or physical exam findings were observed in patients 
administered ALN -AS1 or placebo.  
Part C Cohort 3 5.0 mg/kg SC monthly dosing is ongoing.  In this cohor t there was one fatal 
SAE of acute pancreatitis, which was determined to be unlikely related to study drug or placebo

30 by the Investigator due to the presence of gall bladder sludge found at the time of her 
presentation.  Contributors to this patient's adve rse clinical course included: pre -existing chronic 
debilitation from recurrent AIP attacks requiring monthly hospitalization, porphyria -attributed 
quadriplegia requiring nursing home care, delay in hospital admission and complications from 
thromboembolism (multiple risk factors included pancreatitis, obesity, immobilisation from 
quadriparesis and recent hospitalization for infected portacath removal).  Serum lipase was added 
to all scheduled laboratory assessments in November 2016 as part of additional safe ty 
monitoring. To date, all lipase results (available in 11 of 15 subjects) have been at or below the 
upper limit of normal with no trends seen with dosing of study drug or placebo.  
Further information on the safety, efficacy, PK and PD of ALN -AS1 are avai lable in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.6.4.  Drug -Drug Interactions 
An open -label drug-drug interaction ( DDI) study (ALN -AS1-004) was conducted in AIP patients 
who are ASHE to evaluate the effect of a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1 administered SC 
on the pharmacokinetics of probe substrates for 5  major CYP enzymes that account for the 
metabolism of approximately 80% of prescribed drugs. (31, 32)  Results  from this study 
demonstrated that ALN -AS1 treatment resulted in weak to moderate reduction in the metabolic 
activity of some of the 5 CYP enzymes studied, thereby leading to higher concentrations of some 
substrates and their metabolites .  Treatment with A LN-AS1 resulted in an approximately 3 -fold 
increase in exposure (as measured by AUC) of caffeine (a sensitive substrate for CYP1A2) and 
an approximately 2 -fold increase in exposure of dextromethorphan (a sensitive substrate for 
CYP2D6).  Exposure of midazo lam (a sensitive substrate for CYP3A4) and omeprazole (a 
sensitive substrate for CYP2C19) increased less than 2 -fold after treatment with ALN -AS1.  
There was no effect of ALN -AS1 treatment on losartan (a sensitive substrate for CYP2C9).  
1.7. Benefit -Risk Assess ment  
Patients participating in this study may experience a reduced number or severity of porphyria 
attacks, reduced treatment with IV hemin, and/or reduced requirement for pain medication.  As 
presented in Section  1.6, emerging data  demonstrate that patients given ALN -AS1 experienced 
reduced ALA/PBG levels, decreased attack frequency and reduced heme usage in the 24 -week 
treatment period compared to the 12 -week run -in period in Study ALN -AS1-001 
As detailed in Section  1.6, a fatal SAE of hemorrhagic pancreatitis was reported but deemed to 
be unli kely related to study drug.  However, the potentially non -adverse nonclinical finding of 
angiectasis in the islets of Langerhans (endocrine, not exocrine region) of the rat pancreas (see 
Investigator Brochure), do not exclude a potential association betwee n ALN -AS1 and the SAE of 
hemorrhagic pancreatitis.  
The important potential risks associated with administration of ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP 
are as follows:  
Injection site reactions (ISRs):  ALN -AS1 is administered by SC injection.  In the
ongoing ALN -AS1 clinical study, AEs of ISRs have been infrequently reported and
have been mild to moderate in severity with single dosing.  Injection site rotation and
189
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 6 28 May 2019  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  
 31 close monitoring have been implemented in ALN -AS1 clinical studies to reduce the 
potential for ISRs.  
 Pancreatitis: Since an association between ALN -AS1 and the fatal SAE of 
hemorrhagic pancreatitis can not be ruled out, patients will undergo routine 
monitoring of systemic and pancreatic inflammation and coagulation throughout the 
study.  Hematology, chem istry and coagulation results are required to be available 
prior to each dose.  
 Liver transaminase abnormalities:  As ALN -AS1 is targeted for delivery to the liver, 
and reversible hepatic changes were observed in some animal species, there is a 
potential fo r development of liver function test ( LFT) abnormalities.  To minimize the 
potential for LFT abnormalities, patients are required to have adequate liver function 
at study entry and LFTs are monitored during the study.  
 Anaphylactic reactions:  There is a po tential risk of developing a severe allergic 
reaction with ALN -AS1 administration.  In the present study, one patient in the 
2.5 mg/kg monthly dose group with a history of asthma and multiple allergies 
experienced an SAE of anaphylactic reaction that was d etermined by the Investigator 
to be definitely related to study drug given the temporal relationship of ALN -AS1 
treatment to the onset of the reaction (within minutes).  The patient was treated and 
recovered and was discontinued from the study.  Guidance o n dose administration 
and monitoring for anaphylactic reactions has been included in this protocol.  
The complete summary of the clinical and nonclinical data relevant to the investigational drug 
and its study in human subjects is provided in the Investigat or’s Brochure.

4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.1. Summary of Study Design  
This is a Phase 1/2 multicenter, open -label extension study to evaluate the long -term safety and 
clinical activity of ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP who complete d study ALN -AS1-001.  The 
study will be conducted at up to 8 clinical study centers worldwide.  
The last assessments performed, determining previous study (ALN -AS1-001) completion, will 
serve as the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed 
since the last assessment, safety assessments (eg, ECG and clinical laboratory tests) will be 
repeated before administration of ALN -AS1.  It is anticipated that patients will begin ALN -AS1 
administration in this study within 6 mon ths after the last dose of study drug in the previous 
study.  Eligibility will be confirmed during Screening/Baseline and before administration of the 
first dose of ALN -AS1 (Day 1).  Patients will undergo assessments at the clinical study center 
every mont h for the first 3 months.  Then, through Month 6, and according to the dosing regimen 
selected, assessments will take place at the clinical study center or via a phone contact (for an 
every month dosing regimen, visits will be every month; for an every 3 m onths dosing regimen, 
visits will be every 3 months; see Section  6.2.2 ).  After a patient has completed 12 months of 
ALN -AS1 administration in this study (6 months in an every month dosing regimen), and where 
applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, study procedures, including 
191
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 6 28 May 2019  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  
 33 ALN -AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional (as 
indica ted in the Schedules of Assessments in  Table  1, Table  2, and Table  3; and Table  5, Table  6, 
and Table  7 in Appendix Section  11.2).  Study procedures may occur at the patient’s home at the 
discretion of the Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to 
complete at least 1 visit at the clinical study center every 3 months for the first year, and 
thereafter every 6 months through the end of the treatment perio d.  Additional visits to collect 
clinical laboratory samples may occur at home at any point during the treatment period, within 
14 days prior to scheduled dose administration.  Patients will return to the clinical study center 
for a posttreatment follow -up visit after administration of the last dose of ALN -AS1.   An 
ALA/PBG Monitoring/EOS visit will be conducted either at the clinical study center or via 
phone contact, unless treatment continues with ALN -AS1.  
Patients or caregivers will be provided with a di ary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain 
assessments, and narcotic use.  Additionally, patients will be encouraged to report to the clinical 
study center if they experience a porphyria attack through Month 49.  In the event that patients 
are unable to r eport to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laboratory sample 
collection kits containing instructions for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical 
study center, if possible, will be provided.  Patients will be contacted by pho ne after a porphyria 
attack to record attack details.  If patients are experiencing signs and symptoms of a porphyria 
attack when ALN -AS1 administration is scheduled, the Investigator will determine whether 
administration of ALN -AS1 is appropriate.  If pat ients are treated for a porphyria attack at a 
health care facility (eg, hospital, emergency department, infusion center, or outpatient clinic) 
other than the clinical study center, copies of medical records, including discharge summaries, 
will be requested .   
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review safety and tolerability data collected during the 
study with the primary purpose of protecting the safety of patients participating in the study (see 
Section  4.6). 
Patients may receive ALN -AS1 as long as they do not fulfill any of the study discontinuation 
criteria (see Section  5.3) or until ALN -AS1 is commercially available in the patient’s territory or 
the ALN -AS1 development program is discontinued (whichever comes first).  
All patients are asked to participate in a Posttreatment Follow -up visit after they have received 
their last dose of ALN -AS1. 
Figure  3: Study Design  
 
a Patients who discontinue treatment will be asked to complete an  early termination (ET) visit at which all Month  49 
visit procedures will be performed; they must also return for a safety -follow -up visit 3  months (84 [+  7] days) after 
their last dose of ALN -AS1.

(ICF), the patient will be assigned a screening number by the clinical study site, which will be 
the same unique patient identifier assigned in the previous study (ALN -AS1-001).   The 
Investigator, or delegate, will confirm that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of 
the exclusion criteria.  
4.5. Blinding  
This is an open -label study, and all patients will receive ALN -AS1.  
4.6. Safety Review Committee  
An SRC will be invol ved in the conduct of this study.  The SRC has the responsibility for 
monitoring the safety of the study participants.  The SRC will perform periodic reviews of safety 
and tolerability data during the course of the clinical study at least every 3 months fo r the first 6 
months of the study and thereafter at least every 6 months.  The SRC may also meet on an ad hoc 
basis for review of emergent safety and tolerability data, as defined in the SRC Charter for this 
clinical study.  The SRC will not stop the study  for efficacy.  
The SRC will be comprised of the following members:  Principal Investigator(s), or designee(s), 
the Sponsor Medical Monitor, and the Study Medical Monitor.  
The membership of the SRC and reporting structure are further defined in the SRC Char ter.

cannot be breast feeding, and must be willing to use acceptable methods  of contraception 
14 days before first dose, throughout study participation, and for 90 days after last dose 
administration.  Acceptable methods include hormonal methods along with an additional 
barrier method (eg, condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap), or a  double barrier method of 
contraception for those WOCBP for whom a hormonal method of contraception is 
medically contraindicated due to underlying disease  (see Section  6.4 for acceptable 
methods of contraception ).   
4. Willing and able to comply with the study requirements and to provide written informed 
consent  
5.2. Exclusion Criteria  
Each patient must not meet any of the following exclusion criteria to be el igible for enrollment in 
this study : 
1. Alanine transaminase ≥2.0×ULN or total bilirubin ≥2 mg/dL (unless bilirubin elevation is 
due to Gilbert’s syndrome)  
2. Estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (using the Modification of Diet 
in Renal Disease formula)  
3. History of multiple drug allergies or history of allergic reaction to an oligonucleotide or 
to N-acetyl galactosamine ligand (GalNAc)  
4. Received an investigational agent, other than ALN -AS1, or who a re in follow -up of 
another clinical study of an investigational agent within 90 days before study drug 
administration  
5. Other medical conditions or comorbidities which, in the opinion of the Investigator, 
would interfere with study compliance or data interpr etation  
5.3. Discontinuation of Study Drug and/or Study  
Patients or their legal guardians (in the case that the patient is a minor) are free to discontinue 
treatment and/or study or withdraw their consent at any time and for any reason, without penalty 
to their  continuing medical care.  Any discontinuation of treatment or of the study must be fully 
documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF), and should be followed up by the 
Investigator.  The Investigator may withdraw a patient from the study at any ti me if this is 
considered to be in the patient’s best interest.  
Discontinuation of study drug and withdrawal from the study are described in Section  5.3.1  and 
Section  5.3.2 , respectively.  If a patient stops participation from the study or withdraws consent 
from the study, he/she will not be able to re-enroll in the study.

Amendment 6 28 May 2019  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  
 36 5.3.1.  Discontinuation of Study Drug  
The Investigator or designee may discontinue dosing in a patient if the patient:  
 Is in violation of the protocol  
 Experiences a SAE considered to be possibly or definitely related to the study drug or  
an intolerable AE  
 Becomes pregnant  
 Is found to be considerably noncompliant with the protocol -requirements  
Patients who are pregnant will be discontinued from study drug dosing immediately (see 
Section  7.5.6.6  for reporting and follow -up of pregnancy).  A positive urine pregnancy test 
should be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test prior to discontinuing the study drug.  
If a patient discontinues dosing  due to a serious adverse event (SAE), the SAE should be 
followed as described in Section  7.5.6 .  When a patient discontinues study drug dosing, the 
primary reason must be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  Patients who 
discontinue study drug and remain on study may receive treatment consistent with local standard 
practice for their disease per Investigator judgement, as applicable.  
Patients who discontinue treatment will be asked to complete an early termination (ET) visit at 
which all Month 49 visit procedures will be performed; they must also return for a safety -follow -
up visit 3 months (84 [+ 7] days) after their last dose of ALN -AS1.  
5.3.2.  Discontinuation from the Study  
A patient or their legal guardian may decide to stop the patient’s participation in the study at any 
time.  Patients considering to stop the study should be informed that they can discontinue 
treatment and complete study  assessments including follow -up, as per the SOA, or alternatively 
may complete any minimal assessments for which the patient consents. The Investigator may 
withdraw a patient at any time if this is considered to be in the patient’s best interest.  
However,  study integrity and interpretation is best maintained if all randomized patients continue 
study assessments and follow -up.  Stopping study participation could mean:  
 If a patient discontinues from the study, he/she will be asked to complete an early 
termin ation (ET) visit at which all Month 49 visit procedures will be performed; 
the patient must also return for a safety -follow -up visit at 3 months (84 [+7] days) 
after his/her last dose of ALN -AS1.  
 A patient can stop taking the study drug and stop study -related visits, but allow 
the investigator and study team to review the patient’s medical records, public 
records or be contacted in order to receive information about the patient’s health  
When a patient stops the study, the discontinuation and reason for disc ontinuation must be 
recorded  in the appropriate section of the electronic case report form (eCRF) and all efforts will 
be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible.  If a patient stops the 
study due to an adverse event (AE), in cluding an SAE, the AE should be followed as described 
in Section  7.5.6 . 
If the patient wants to stop participation in the study, he/she should notif y the study doctor in 
195

 37 writing or in any other form that may be locally required. The personal data already collected 
during the study, including patient’s biological samples, will still be used together with the data 
collected on other patients in the stud y according to the informed consent and applicable laws.  
In addition to stopping participation in the study, the patient could decide to withdraw his/her 
consent as explained in Section  5.3.3  
5.3.3.  Withdrawal  of Consent to Collect and Process the Patient’s Personal Data  
The patient may decide to withdraw his/her consent informing the study doctor at any time in 
writing, or in any other form that may be locally required.  This  means that the patient wants to 
stop participation in the study and any further collection of his/her personal data.  
 The sponsor will continue to keep and use a patient's study information (including 
any data resulting from the ana lysis of the patient's biological samples until time 
of withdrawal) according to applicable law.  This is done to guarantee the validity 
of the study, determine the effects of the study treatment, and ensure 
completeness of study documentation.  
 The patient  can also request that collected samples be destroyed or returned (to 
the extent it is permitted by applicable law) at any time.  
 Patients who withdraw their consent to collect and use personal data should 
understand that public records may be reviewed to d etermine the patient’s 
survival status as allowed per local and national regulations.    
In US and Japan, otherwise, samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal may still be used 
for further testing/analysis in accordance with the terms of the proto col and of the informed 
consent form.  
In EU and rest of world, in any event, samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal will 
not be used any longer, unless permitted by applicable law. They will be stored or destroyed 
according to applicable legal requirements.  
5.3.4.  Replacement of Patients  
Patients discontinuing from study drug or withdrawing from the study will not be replaced.  
6. TREATMENTS  
6.1. Treatments Administered  
ALN -AS1 Solution for Injection (SC use) is a clear, colorless to pale yellow solution essent ially 
free of particulates.  ALN -AS1 will be supplied by the Sponsor as a sterile solution for SC 
injection.  
Study drug supplied for this study must not be used for any purpose other than the present study 
and must not be administered to any person not enr olled in the study.  Study drug that has been 
dispensed to a patient and returned unused must not be re -dispensed to a different patient.

 38 6.2. Investigational Study Drug  
Detailed information describing the preparation, handling, and storage, packaging and label ing, 
as well as study drug accountability for ALN -AS1 is provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.2.1.  Description  
ALN -AS1 Solution for Injection (SC use) is comprised of a synthetic, siRNA targeting ALAS1 
and bearing a triantennary GalNAc ligand conjugated to the sens e strand, formulated in 
phosphate buffer.  
6.2.2.  Dose and Administration  
The study starting dose of ALN -AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg ALN -AS1 as an SC injection administered 
every 3 months (Table  1, Table  2, and Table  3). Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may 
approve changes to the ALN -AS1 d osing regimen, including decreases in the dose level and 
changes in dosing frequency (Table  5, Table  6, and Table  7 in Section  11.2).  However, any dose 
and dosing regimen will not exceed a previously explored dose level or frequency that was 
determined to be safe and well -tolerated in study ALN -AS1-001. SRC, Health Authority and 
Ethics Committee approval must be sought prior to dose level escalation above 5.0 mg/kg in 
accordance with local Regulatory r equirements.  See Section  6.2.3  for details on dose 
modifications.  
ALN -AS1 will be administered by a qualified and authorized health care professiona l trained in 
the recognition and management of anaphylactic reactions.  The study drug should be injected 
into the abdomen or upper arms or thighs.  Detailed instructions for study drug administration are 
presented in the Pharmacy Manual. As is consistent with good medical practice for subcutaneous 
drug administration, patients will be observed for a minimum of 20 minutes after each injection.   
Treatment for anaphylactic reactions should be readily available where patients are being dosed, 
and follow count ry and/or local hospital treatment guidelines as shown in Table  8.(33) 
After a patient has completed 12 months of ALN -AS1 administration in this study (6 months in 
an every month dosing regimen),  study drug administration may be conducted at a location other 
than the study center by a home healthcare professional, where applicable country and local 
regulations and infrastructure allow, after consultation with the medical monitor, during 
particular  study visits, as specified in the Schedules of Assessments.  However, study drug 
administration at the study center should be considered for patients who have ongoing study 
drug-related AEs or known risk factors for developing anaphylactic reaction, inclu ding but not 
limited to: a prior history of anaphylactic reaction to food, medications or due to unknown 
etiology, worsening injection site reactions with repeat dosing, or anyone in the opinion of the 
investigator that would benefit from clinical observat ion following dosing.  Patients are required 
to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical study center every 3 months for the first year, and 
thereafter every 6 months through the end of the treatment period.   Additional visits to collect 
clinical laborato ry samples may occur at home at any point during the treatment period, within 
14 days prior to scheduled dose administration.  
If a patient does not receive a dose of ALN -AS1 within the specified dosing window, the 
Investigator should contact the Medical Mo nitor.  After such consultation, the dose may be 
administered or considered missed and not administered.  
197

Amendment 6 28 May 2019  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  
 39 Patients will be permitted to miss an occasional dose of study drug; however, if a patient misses 
2 consecutive doses, the Investigator, in consultatio n with the Medical Monitor, will discuss 
whether the patient will be able to continue on the study.  
Detailed instructions for study drug administration are found in the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.2.3.  Dose Modifications  
6.2.3.1.  Study Population Dose Modifications  
During the stu dy, dose modifications are permitted for the study population, or based on the dose 
cohort into which patients were originally randomized in study ALN -AS1-001.  Following SRC 
review of emerging safety and tolerability data from Part C of study ALN -AS1-001, or from this 
study (ALN -AS1-002), the dose and dosing regimen may be modified.  However, the dose and 
dosing regimen of ALN -AS1 will not exceed a previously explored dose and dosing regimen that 
was determined to be safe and well -tolerated in study ALN -AS1-001.  Patients enrolling in this 
study after a dose modification decision has been implemented may start at the newly identified 
dose and regimen.  
6.2.3.2.  Individual Dose Modifications  
Dose modifications are permitted for individual patients.  If a patient has a  study drug related AE 
of a recurrent ISR, severe ISR, or clinically significant LFT abnormality and the Investigator has 
concerns regarding further ALN -AS1 administration, the Medical Monitor and Investigator will 
review all available safety data for the patient.  Based on this review, a dose reduction to half the 
previously administered dose (eg, a 5.0 mg/kg dose would be reduced to a 2.5 mg/kg dose) or a 
reduction in dosing frequency from monthly to every 3 months is permitted.  Subsequent ALN -
AS1 admini stration at the previous dose may be considered based on the judgment of the 
Investigator and Medical Monitor.  
6.2.3.2.1.  Monitoring and Dosing Rules in Patients with Potential Cases of Anaphylactic 
Reaction   
An anaphylactic reaction is a severe, potentially fatal, systemic allergic reaction with acute onset 
(minutes to hours).  For reference see Section  11.3.(33) 
Stop administering the study medication immediately  if an anaphyl actic reaction to the study 
medication is suspected.  Study medication must be permanently discontinued in patients for 
whom an anaphylactic reaction is assessed as related to the study medication.  
Laboratory testing:  Obtain blood sample for tryptase, tota l IgE, and ADA  antidrug antibodies 
(ADA) ideally within 15 minutes to 3 hours after the onset of a suspected anaphylactic reaction; 
however, up to 6 hours is acceptable.  An additional blood sample to assess tryptase, total IgE, 
and ADA should be obtained between  1 to 2 weeks from onset of event.  Local laboratory may 
be used to analyze samples; however, parallel samples should be sent to the central laboratory for 
analysis.  Sample collection and shipping instructions are included in the Laboratory Manual.  
Reporting : The PI or designee must notify the sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the 
occurrence of a suspected case of anaphylactic reaction or being informed of the case as required

40 for AEs of Clinical Interest (AECI) and SAEs, per AE reporting requi rements (Section  7.5.6.1 ,  
Section  7.5.6.2  and 7.5.6.3 ). 
6.2.4.  Preparation, Handling, and Storage  
Staff at each clinical study center or the home healthcare professional will be responsible for 
preparation of ALN -AS1 doses, according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy Manual.  No 
special procedures for the safe handling of study drug are required.  
Study drug will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately 5±3°C.  Any deviation from 
the recommended storage conditions should be reported to the Sponsor and use of the study drug 
halted until authorization for its continued use has been provided by the Sponsor or designee.  
A Sponsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon reques t, to audit the supplies, 
storage, dispensing procedures, and records.  
6.2.5.  Packaging and Labeling  
All packaging, labeling, and production of study drug will be in compliance with current Good 
Manufacturing Practice specifications, as well as applicable local r egulations.  Study drug labels 
and external packaging will include all appropriate information as per local labeling 
requirements.  
Additional details will be available in the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.2.6.  Accountability  
The Investigator or designee will maintain accura te records of receipt and the condition of the 
study drug supplied for this study, including dates of receipt.  In addition, accurate records will 
be kept of when and how much study drug is dispensed and administered to each patient in the 
study.  Any reas ons for departure from the protocol dispensing regimen must also be recorded.  
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of all study drugs.  All used, 
partially used, and unused study drug will be returned to the Sponsor (or desi gnee) or destroyed 
at the clinical study center according to applicable regulations.   
Further instructions about drug accountability are detailed in the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.3. Concomitant Medications  
Use of concomitant medications will be recorded on the patient’s case report form (CRF) as 
indicated in the Schedules of Assessments ( Table  1, Table  2, and Table  3; and Table  5, Table  6, 
and Table  7 in Appendix Section  11.2).  This includes all prescription medications, herbal 
prepara tions, over the counter (OTC) medications, vitamins, and minerals.  Any changes in 
medications during the study will also be recorded on the CRF.  
Any concomitant medication that is required for the patient’s welfare may be administered by the 
Investigator.   However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding 
the medication are recorded on the eCRF.  Concomitant medication will be coded using an 
internationally recognized and accepted coding dictionary.  
Patients with porphy ria could have altered hepatic heme synthesis, and treatment with ALN -AS1

41 could also modulate this pathway and secondarily impact CYP enzyme activity.  Result s from a 
DDI study in AIP patients who are ASHE are presented in Section 1.6.4.  The DDI study 
demons
trated that ALN-AS1 treatment resulted in weak to moderate reduction in activity in 
some of the CYP enzymes resulting in corresponding low to moderate increase in the plasma 
levels of drugs that are metabolize d by these CYP enzymes.  Based on the moderate decrease in 
CYP2D6 or CYP1A2 activity, investigators will review all concomitant medicati ons that are 
primarily metabolized by these enzymes and monitor the patient’s clinical response to these 
medications during the study.  Medications metabolized primarily by CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 
with a narrow therapeutic index (ie that require regular laboratory moni toring) may need to be 
monitored more frequently to determine if a dose adjustment of the concomitant medication is 
required.  For patients who require new medications while on study, selection of medic ations that 
are not primarily meta bolized by CYP2D6 or CYP1A2 should be considered.  Refer to the 
individual product’s prescription information to determine if there is a need to monitor 
concomitant medications for differences in safety or efficacy of the medic ation based on reported 
DDIs with CYP2D6 or CYP1A2.  For more detailed and up-t o-date information on CYP 
substrates, see: 
https://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/developmentresources/druginteractionsl  
abeling/ucm093664.htm.  
Patients are not permitted to be on hemin prophylaxis at Screening; however, pat ients are 
permitted to receive concomitant hemin treatment for the management of acute porphyria 
attacks.  Patients experiencing significant breakthrough attacks while enrolled in this study, 
necessitating frequent hemin treatment, may receive hemin prophy laxis if in the Investigator’s 
judgment this is clinically beneficial to the patient.  The Investigator should contact with the 
Sponsor and Medical Monitor before prophylactic hemin treatment.  The dose, regimen, and 
dates of administration will be recorde d on the patient’s eCRF.   
Pain medication (eg, opiates, opioids, narcotic analgesics) and glucose administration are 
permitted for the management of porphyria and for acute porphyria attacks.  
If patients use nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory medications inte rmittently or chronically, they 
must have been able to tolerate them with no previous side effects (eg, gastric distress or 
bleeding).   
Standard vitamins and topical medications are permitted; however, topical steroids must not be 
applied anywhere near th e injection site(s) unless medically indicated.  
6.4. Contraceptive Requirements  
No data are available on the use of ALN -AS1 in pregnancy; however, there is no suspicion of 
human teratogenicity based on class effects or genotoxic potential.  ALN -AS1 was neither 
genotoxic nor clastogenic in in vitro and in vivo studies.   
WOCBP must be willing to use acceptable methods of contraception 14 days before first dose, 
throughout study participation, and for 90 days after last dose administration.   
Birth control methods  which may be considered as acceptable include:  
Established use of oral, implantable, injectable, transdermal hormonal, or intrauterine
hormone -releasing system as methods of contraception.  WOCBP using hormonal
200
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 6 28 May 2019  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  
 42 methods of contraception must also use a bar rier method  (condom or occlusive cap 
[diaphragm or cervical/vault cap] in conjunction with spermicide [eg, foam, gel, film, 
cream, or suppository]).  
 If hormonal methods of contraception are medically contraindicated for WOCBP due 
to underlying disease, a d ouble -barrier method (combination of male condom with 
either cap, diaphragm, or sponge, in conjunction with spermicide) is also considered 
an acceptable method of contraception.  
 Placement of an intrauterine device  
 Bilateral tubal occlusion  
 Surgical steril ization of male partner (with the appropriate post -vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the 
study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient)  
 Sexual abstinence, when this i s in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
patient, is considered an acceptable method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study 
drug (defined above).  Periodic absti nence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not considered sexual abstinence and do 
not meet criteria for an acceptable method of birth control.  As determined by the 
investigator, the reliability of sexual abs tinence needs to be evaluated in relation to 
the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Abstinent patients must agree to use 1 of the abovementioned contraceptive methods 
if they start a heterosexual relations hip during the study and continue to do so for the 
entire period of risk associated with the study drug (defined above).  
 WOCBP includes any female patient who has experienced menarche and who is not 
postmenopausal or permanently sterilized (eg, bilateral t ubal occlusion, hysterectomy, 
or bilateral salpingectomy).  Postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 
months without an alternative medical cause, confirmed by follicle stimulating 
hormone level within the postmenopausal range.  
6.5. Treatment Complian ce 
Compliance with study drug administration will be verified through observation by study 
personnel or trained home healthcare professionals.  
7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
The schedules of study assessments are provided in Table  1, Table  2, and Table  3; and Table  5, 
Table  6, and Table  7.  
7.1. Screening/Baseline Assessments  
Informed consent, patient demographic data, and eligibility criteria will be confirmed at 
Screening/Baseline.  An interval medical history/disease history will be obtained at 
Screening/Baseline.  The last assessments  performed, determining previous study 
201
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 6 28 May 2019  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  
 43 (ALN -AS1-001) completion, will serve as the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If 
more than 60 days have elapsed since the last assessment, clinical laboratory tests and ECGs will 
be repeated before admini stration of ALN -AS1.  
7.2. Clinical Activity Assessments  
The clinical activity of ALN -AS1 will be assessed by the frequency and characteristics of 
porphyria attacks including, but not limited to, duration, treatment, and severity of porphyria 
attacks and number and duration of visits to a health care setting for acute porphyria care (eg, 
hospital, emergency department, infusion center, or outpatient clinic).  Concomitant hemin 
administration will also be recorded.  
7.2.1.  Patient Diary  
Patients or caregivers will be prov ided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain 
assessments, and narcotic use.  
7.2.2.  Brief Pain Inventory -Short Form Questionnaire  
The Brief Pain Inventory -Short Form (BPI -SF) questionnaire will be used to evaluate pain .(34)  
The BPI will be completed as part of the patient diary.  
7.3. Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Blood and urine samples will be collected for assessment of ALN -AS1 PD parameters.  The PD 
effect of ALN -AS1 will be evaluated by urine ALA and PBG levels.  Bl ood and urine samples 
will be collected for assessment of circulating ALAS1 mRNA levels in serum and in urine.  
Analysis for blood and urine PD parameters will take place at a central laboratory.   
Details regarding the processing and aliquoting of samples  for storage and analyses will be 
provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
7.4. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate the PK profile of ALN -AS1 at the time points in the 
Schedule of Assessments.  A detailed schedule of time points fo r the collection of blood samples 
for PK analysis is in Table  4 in Appendix Section  11.1). 
The concentration of ALN -AS1 will be determined using a validated assay.  Details regarding 
the processing, shipping, and analysis of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
7.5. Safety Assessments  
The assessment of safety during the course of the study will consist of the surveillance and 
recording of AEs including SAEs, recording of concomitant medications and measurements of 
vital signs, physical examination, and ECG findings and clinical laborato ry evaluations.  
Safety will be monitored over the course of the study by an SRC as described in Section  4.6.

Amendment 6 28 May 2019  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  
44 7.5.1.  Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements incl ude blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory 
rate.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be consistent for each 
patient), after the patient has rested comfortably for at least 10 minutes.  Blood pressur e should 
be taken using the same arm throughout the study.  Body temperature will be obtained in degrees 
Celsius, heart rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in beats per minute, and 
respiration rate will be counted for a full minute and reco rded in breaths per minute.  
For the safety of the patient, additional vital sign assessments may be added at the discretion of 
the Investigator.  
7.5.2.  Weight and Height  
Height will be measured in centimeters at the Screening/Baseline visit only.  Body weight wil l be 
measured in kilograms.  Body mass index will be calculated in the database.  
Body weight measured on the dosing day will be used to calculate the dose of ALN -AS1 through 
M12.  After M12, weight measured at either the previous study center visit or curr ent study 
center visit may be used for dosing calculations.  
7.5.3.  Physical Examination  
Complete physical examinations will include the examination of the following:  general 
appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, chest/respiratory, heart/cardiovascular, 
gastrointestinal/liver, musculoskeletal/extremities, dermatological/skin, thyroid/neck, lymph 
nodes, and neurological/psychiatric.  
Targeted physical examinations will include the examination of the following:  general 
appearance, chest/respiratory, heart/c ardiovascular, gastrointestinal/liver, and 
neurological/psychiatric.  
7.5.4.  Electrocardiogram  
Triplicate standard 12 -lead ECGs will be performed using central ECG equipment, with readings 
approximately 1 minute apart and recorded as specified in the Schedule of A ssessments.  Patients 
should be seated or supine for at least 5 minutes before each ECG is obtained.  The 
electrophysiological parameters assessed will be rhythm, ventricular rate, PR interval, QRS 
duration, QT interval, ST and T waves, Bazett -corrected QT  interval (QTcB), and Fridericia 
corrected QT interval (QTcF).  
When ECG and blood sample collection occur at the same time, ECGs should be performed 
before blood samples are drawn.  
Using central ECG equipment, triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be performed in t he seated or supine 
position after the patient has rested comfortably for at least 5  minutes.   
In all patients receiving ≤2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1, it is required that ECGs will be obtained on at 
least 2 separate clinic visits (D1, and Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or  18), each of which will include 
same day predose and 2 -hour (±15  minutes) postdose readings, paired with PK timepoints 
(Table  4) as specified in the Schedule of Assessments.   
203
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 6 28 May 2019  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  
45 Similarly, in all patients receiving >2.5 mg/kg ALN-AS1, it is required that ECGs will be 
obtained on at least 2 separa te clinic visits (D1, and Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or 18), each of which 
will include same day predose and 4-hour (±20 minutes) postdose readings, paired with PK 
timepoints (Table 4), as specified in the Schedule of Assessments.  
The Investi gator or designee is responsible for reviewing the  ECGs to assess whether the results 
have changed since the Screening/ Baseline visit and to determine the clinical relevance  of the 
results.  These assessments will be recorded on the eCRF.  For any clinical ly relevant ECG 
changes from the Screening/Baseline visit (eg, ischemic ECG changes, wave/interval changes, or 
arrhythmia), the Investigator must contact the Medical Monitor to discuss continued participation 
of the patient in the study . 
7.5.5.  Clinical Laborator y Assessments  
The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory.  
On dosing days up to the Month 18 visit, results from hematology, chemistry, and coagulation 
tests collected within the prior 14 days must be reviewed by the  Investigator before study drug 
administration.  These results can be analyzed centrally or at a local laboratory.  If results from 
within the prior 14 days are not available at a dosing visit (at visits from D1 to Month 18), 
locally analyzed assessments m ust be reviewed to allow same day study drug administration  and 
additional samples for central analysis must  also be collected.  On dosing days from Month  19 
through Month 48, a review of laboratory results within 14 days is not required.   
In the event of  an unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study 
drug administration, the test should be repeated and followed up at the discretion of the 
Investigator until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diag nosis is made to 
adequately explain the abnormality.  
At any point during the study, and based on Investigator judgment, if a patient experiences 
uncharacteristic signs and symptoms during a porphyria attack, lipase testing should be 
performed and imaging e valuations (eg, right upper quadrant ultrasound and/or other testing, 
based on Investigator judgment) should be considered by the Investigator.  Signs and symptoms 
include, but are not limited to, uncharacteristic abdominal pain and worsening nausea and 
vomiting.  
Imaging is required for any serum lipase result of ≥3× the upper limit of normal, or as clinically 
indicated.

Blood samples will be collected to evaluate antidrug antibodies.  On days when ALN -AS1 is 
administered, blood samples for antidrug antibody testing must be collected before ALN -AS1 is  
administered.  
Sample collection for patients who experience a potential anaphylactic reaction is discussed in 
Section  6.2.3.2.1 . 
Details regarding th e processing, shipping, and analysis of the samples will be provided in the

7.5.5.2.  Pregnancy Testing  
A pregnancy test will be performed for WOCBP only.  A serum pregnancy test will be 
performed at Screening/Baseline and urine pregnancy tests wi ll be performed thereafter per the 
Schedule of Assessments and any time pregnancy is suspected.  Urine pregnancy tests may also 
be performed more frequently (eg, monthly) based on local country requirements.  The results of 
the pregnancy test must be known  before study drug administration.  Patients who are pregnant 
are not eligible for study participation.  Any woman with a positive pregnancy test during the 
study will be discontinued from study drug, but will continue to be followed for safety.  Patients 
determined to be pregnant while on study will be followed until the pregnancy outcome is known 
(see Section  7.5.6.6  for follow -up instructions).  
7.5.6.  Adverse Events  
7.5.6.1.  Definitions  
Adverse Event  
According to the ICH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 21 
Code of Federal Regulations 312.32, Investigational New Drug Safety Reporting, an AE is any 
untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational subject administered a 
medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening (An event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred.  It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death)  
 Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolon gation of existing hospitalization  
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization but ma y jeopardize the patient and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above (eg, 
206
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 6 28 May 2019  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  
 48 events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions , or the development of drug 
dependency or abuse).  
Adverse Event Severity  
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below:  
Mild:  Mild events are those which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal 
daily activity.  
Moderate:  Moderate events are those which cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with 
normal daily activities.  
Severe:  Severe events are those which incapacitate and prevent usual activity.  
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record  to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity.  AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of the start and stop of each incidence.  When changes in the severity of an AE 
occur more frequently than once a day, the  maximum severity for the experience that day should 
be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be 
recorded separately (with distinct onset dates)  
AE severity and seriousness are assessed independently.  ‘S everity’ characterizes the intensity of 
an AE.  ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for Serious Adverse Event).  
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study T reatment  
The relationship of each AE to study treatment should be evaluated by the Investigator using the 
following criteria:  
Definitely related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to the me dication administration, and which 
cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
The response to withdrawal of the drug should be clinically plausible.  
Possibly related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to the medication administration, but which 
could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals.  Information on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or 
unclear.  
Unlikely related:  A clinical event, inclu ding laboratory test abnormality, with little or no 
temporal relationship to medication administration, and which other 
drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations.  
Not related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnorm ality that has no 
temporal relationship to the medication or has more likely alternative 
etiology.  
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest  
The following events are considered to be adverse events of clinical interest:  
207
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 6 28 May 2019  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  
 49  ISRs  
 Hepatic AEs, including LFT abnormali ties considered clinically significant by the 
Investigator . 
 Lipase >3×ULN (or >3× the baseline lipase measurement if baseline is >ULN)  
 Anaphylactic Reactions. Anaphylactic reaction is a severe, potentially fatal, systemic 
allergic reaction with acute onset (minutes to hours).  Symptoms of an anaphylactic 
reaction  may include skin or mucosal tissue (e.g. generalized hives, pruritus, 
angioedema), respiratory compr omise (e.g. wheezing, bronchospasm, hypoxia), 
reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (e.g. syncope, hypotonia).  See 
Section  11.3 (Table  8) for guidance on diagnosing anaphylactic reactions. (33) 
7.5.6.2.  Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last 
visit.  The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospitalized, had any accidents, used 
any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC).  
In addition to  patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant 
laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are 
relevant to patient safety.  
Recording Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for recording non -serious AEs that are observed or reported by 
the patient after administration of the first dose of study drug regardless of their relationship to 
study drug through the end of study.  Non -serious AEs will be followed until the end of study.  
The Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by the patient 
after the time when the informed consent is signed regardless of their relationship to study drug 
through the end of study.  SAEs will be followed until satisfa ctory resolution, until baseline level 
is reached, or until the SAE is considered by the Investigator to be chronic or the patient is 
stable, as appropriate.  
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for 
the patient, whether or not they are considered to be drug -related.  Each AE must be described in 
detail:  onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to investigational drug, 
action taken, and outcome (including time and date of resol ution, if applicable).  
For SAEs, record the event(s) on the eCRF.  If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is 
unavailable, complete the backup SAE form.  
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest, the Sponsor or its designee should be 
notifie d within 24 hours using a supplemental AEs of clinical interest (AECI) eCRF.  Additional 
clinical and laboratory information may be collected based upon the severity or nature of the 
event.  
If a patient has ISRs meeting any of the following criteria, the I nvestigator or delegate should 
contact the Medical Monitor and submit a supplemental ISR eCRF:  
208
Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 givosiran (ALN -AS1)  
Amendment 6 28 May 2019  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  
 50  ISRs that are recurrent and/or demonstrate a pattern of increasing severity  
 Any ISR that is determined to be severe and/or a cause for study drug discontinuation   
 Any ISR which, in the opinion of the Investigator, requires further medical evaluation or 
treatment  
In some cases, where it is medically appropriate, further evaluation may include photographs, 
referral to a dermatologist, skin biopsy, or other laborator y testing.  If a biopsy was obtained, the 
Sponsor may request that the biopsy also be reviewed by a central dermatopathologist.  To better 
understand the safety profile of the study drug, additional analysis of biopsy tissue may be 
performed according to l ocal regulations.  
For patients with hepatic AEs, additional information, including, clinical history, course of event, 
and local laboratory results to monitor LFT levels or other laboratory parameters, may be 
collected.  
7.5.6.3.  Serious Adverse Events Require Immed iate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee  
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by the Investigator.  Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section  7.5.6.1  must be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee within 24 hours from the time that clinical study center personnel first 
learns of the event.  All SAEs must be reported regardless of the relationship to study drug . 
The initial report should include at least the following information:  
 Patient’s study number  
 Description and date of onset of the event  
 Criterion for serious  
 Preliminary assignment of relationship to study drug  
 Investigator/clinical study center informat ion 
To report the SAE, complete the eCRF.  If the EDC system is unavailable, complete the backup 
SAE form.  Within 24 hours of receipt of follow -up information, the Investigator must update the 
report.  SAEs must be reported using the contact information p rovided in the Study Manual.  
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken by the Investigator using his/her best medical 
judgment to treat the SAE.  These measures and the patient’s response to these measures should 
be recorded.  All SAEs, regardless of r elationship to study drug, will be followed by the 
Investigator until satisfactory resolution or the Investigator deems the SAE to be chronic or 
stable.  Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed by the Investigator as 
needed to adeq uately determine the etiology of the event.  
7.5.6.4.  Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities  
The Sponsor or its representative is required to report certain study events in an expedited 
manner to the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines A gency’s EudraVigilance 
electronic system according to Directive 2001/20/EC, and to all country Regulatory Authorities 
where the study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations.

 When scheduled at the same time points, assessments of vital signs and 12 -lead ECGs should be performed first, before the physical 
examinations and blood/urine sample collections.  
a Patients are not required to complete Screening/Baseline assessments if the assessments in the previous study (ALN -AS1-001) were completed within 60 days 
of administration of the first dose of ALN -AS1 in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed since the last assessment, clinical laboratory tests and ECGs 
will be repeated before administration of ALN -AS1.  Results should be available and deemed acceptable before the administration of the first dose of ALN -
AS1.  
b After a patient has completed 6 mo nths of ALN -AS1 administration in this study, and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, 
study procedures, including ALN -AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional.  Study procedu res may occur at the 
patient’s home at the discretion of the Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to com plete at least 1 visit at the clinical 
study center Q3M through M12, and thereafter Q6M. Additional visits to collect clinical laboratory samples may occur at home at any point during the 
treatment period, within 14 days prior to scheduled dose administration.  
c See Section  7.1 for details on the interval medical history/disease history to be recorded at Screening/Baseline.  Ongoing AEs from the previ ous study 
(ALN -AS1-001) will be captured as medical history.  
d A complete physical examination will be perform ed at Screening/Baseline, and D1.  At all other visits, a targeted physical examination will be performed.  On 
dosing days, the physical examination will be performed predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, the physical examination can occur at  any time 
during the visit.  See Section  7.5.3  for details on the physical examination.  
e Height will be measured at Screening/Baseline only.  
f Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate.  On D1, vital signs will be collected wit hin 1 hour predose; and 2 hours 
(±10 minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour pred ose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, vital signs 
can be collected at any time during the visit.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be cons istent for each patient), after the 
patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  
g Using central ECG equipment, triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine position after the patient has rested comfortably for at least 5 
minutes.  For patients receiving ≤2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1 ECGs will be performed within 1 hour predose and 2 hours (±15 minutes) postdose at a minimum of 2 
of the following visits:  D1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 15 (only if visit is done at clinic), or Month 18.  In patients receiving >2.5 mg/kg 
ALN -AS1, ECGs will be performe d within 1 hour predose and 4 hours (±20 minutes) postdose at a minimum of two of the following visits:  D1, Month 3,

 65 Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 15 (only if visit is done at clinic), or Month 18.  On all other dosing days, ECGs will be collected wit hin 1 hour predose 
(see Section  7.5.4   for ECG assessment details).  
h Clinical laboratory parameters are described in Section  7.5.5 .  On dosing days, blood samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected predose.  On 
days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, blood samples can be collected at any time during the visit. On dosing days up to the Month 18 visit ,result s from 
hematology, chemistry (including LFTs), and coagulation tests collected within the prior 14 days must be reviewed by the Inve stigator before study drug 
administration.  If results from within the prior 14 days are not available at a dosing visit (at  visits from D1 to Month 18), locally analyzed predose assessments 
may be used for review in order to allow same day study drug administration, and additional samples for central analysis must  also be collected.  
i A serum pregnancy test will be performed a t Screening/Baseline; thereafter, urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  Results must be available before dosing.  
j ALN -AS1 will be administered by SC injection according to the Pharmacy Manual.  See Section  6.2.2  for ALN -AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  For weight -
based dosing, weight measured at the current study center visit (dosing day) will be used to calculate the dose of ALN -AS1.  After M12, we ight measured at 
either the previous study center visit or on current study center visit will be used to calculate the weight -based dose of ALN -AS1.  
k Spot urine samples will be collected for measurement of ALA, PBG, and creatinine levels.  On dosing days,  samples should be collected predose.  
l On dosing days, blood and urine samples for ALAS1 mRNA (and possible biomarker) analysis will be collected within 1 hour pred ose. 
m Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points listed in  Table  4 (Appendix Section  11.1).  Blood sample colle ction for PK analysis at 
Month 9 and Month 15 is only necessary if ECG will be performed at same visit.  
n On dosing days, blood samples for antidrug antibody analysis should be collected within 1 hour predose.  
o Porphyria attack laboratory sample collectio n kits should be dispensed at the screening visit along with instructions for use. For any attack that occurs through 
M37, urine samples should be collected within 24 hours of the start of clinical intervention (eg, hemin or glucose administra tion) and wit hin 24 hours of the end 
of clinical intervention.  If patients are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laborator y sample collection kits should be used 
for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study cent er, if possible.  These urine samples may also be analyzed for exploratory biomarkers.  
p In addition to the time points indicated, the EQ -5D-5L questionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a porphyria attack 
(but not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible.  
q Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain assessments, and narcotic use on  a daily basis through M9; 
thereafter, acute porphyria attacks will be recorde d in the diary.  The BPI will be completed on a weekly basis as part of the patient diary through M9, then 
Q3M.  
r Medications that are ongoing from the previous study (ALN -AS1-001), started between the previous study and this study, and started after signing informed 
consent in this study, will be captured as concomitant medication(s).

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  1 ALN -AS1-002 PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT 6  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES D ATED 28 MAY  2019  
A Multicenter, Open -label Extension Study to Evaluate the Long -term Safety and Clinical 
Activity of Subcutaneously Administered ALN AS1 in Patients with Acute Intermittent 
Porphyria who have Completed a Previous Clinical Study with ALN -AS1 
Rationale for Protocol Amendment  
The primary purpose for this protocol amendment is to provide updated information from a 
recently completed drug -drug interaction study (ALN -AS1-004) performed in AIP patients who 
are asymptomatic high excreters in the concomitant medications section (Section  6.3).  The 
results of the study indicated that ALN -AS1 treatment resulted in moderate reductio n in 
CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 activity, weak reduction in CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 activity, and no 
change in the activity of CYP2C9.  
This amendment also extends the treatment period to 48  months to continue the study until 
ALN -AS1 is anticipated to be commercially ava ilable in the countries where the study sites are 
located.  
Additional updates are being implemented as noted below:   clarification that patients may 
continue to receive ALN -AS1 until it is commercially available in the patient’s territory, addition 
of guid ance for serious breaches of protocol, and deletion of Section  11.3, List of Sensitive 
CYP3A substrates and those with a Narrow Therapeutic Range.  
A detailed summary of changes is provided in Table  1.  Corrections to typographical errors, 
punctuation, grammar, abbreviations, and formatting (including administrative changes between 
protocol amendments  5 and 6) are not detailed.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  2 Table  1: Protocol Amendment 6 Detailed Summary of Changes  
The primary section(s) of the protocol affected by the changes in Protocol Amendment  6 are indicated.  The corresponding text has 
been revised throughout the protocol.  Deleted text is indicated by strikeout ; added text is indicated by bold  font. 
Purpose:  Updated Section 1.6, Clinical Data Summary, with results of the open -label drug -drug interaction study (ALN -AS1-004) to support 
changes in Section 6.3, Concomitant Medications.  
The primary change is the addition of Section  1.2.2.3, Drug -drug Interaction Study ALN -AS1-004 
Added text : 
1.6.4  Drug -drug Interaction Study ALN -AS1-004 
An open-label drug-drug interaction (DDI) study (ALN-AS1- 004) was conducted in AIP patients who are 
ASHE to evaluate the effect of a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg ALN-AS1 administered SC on the 
pharmacokinetics of probe substrates for 5 major CYP enzymes that account for the metabolism of 
approximately 80% of prescribed drugs.(31, 32)  Results from this study demonstrated that ALN-AS1 
treatment resulted in weak to moderate reduction in the metabolic activity of some of the 5 CYP 
enzymes studied, thereby leading to higher concentrations of some substrates and their metabolites.  
Treatment with ALN-AS1 resulted in an approximately 3-fold increase in exposure (as measured by 
AUC) of caffeine (a sensitive substrate for CYP1A2) and an approximately 2-fold increase in exposure of 
dextromethorphan (a sen
sitive substrate for CYP2D6).  Exposure of midazolam (a sensitive substrate for 
CYP3A4) and omeprazole (a sensitive substrate for CYP2C19) increased less than 2-fold after treatment 
with ALN -AS1.  There was no effect of ALN -AS1 treatment on losartan (a sensitive substrate for 
CYP2C9). 
Purpose:  Clarify that subjects may continue until givosiran is commercially available or the givosiran development program is discontinued.  
The primary change is the addition of 2  sentences to Section  4.1, Summary of Study Design.  
Added text : Patients may receive ALN -AS1 as long as they do not fulfill any of the study discontinuation criteria (see 
Section  5.3) or unt il ALN -AS1 is commercially available in the patient’s territory or the ALN -AS1 development
program is discontinued (whichever comes first).  
All patients are asked to participate in a Posttreatment Follow -up visit after they have received their last dose of  
ALN -AS1.

Amendment 6 Summary of Changes  28 May  2019  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  3 Section(s) also containing this change:  
Synopsis, Study Design
Purpose:  Updated concomitant medications to indicate that givosiran treatment could affect drugs that are metabolized primar ily by CYP2D6 
and CYP1A2.  
The primary change occurs in Section  6.3, Concomitant Medications  
Formerly read:  Drug-drug interaction studies in NHP, could not exclude the potential for ALN-AS1 to alter the clearance of 
drugs metabolized by the CYP3A enzymes.  Therefore, patients on medications metabolized by CYP3A, 
especially those with narrow therapeutic ranges, may require monitoring for their drug levels or drug response.  
ALN-AS1 could potentially increase the clearance of drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isoform.   
Investigators will review all medications at study start and monitor response to these medications during the 
study.  For patients who require new medications while on study, selection of medications that are not mainly 
metabolized by the CYP3A isoform is recommended.  A list of medications that are sensitive CYP3A 
substrates is included in Table 6 Appendix Section 11.3.  In addition, a more detailed and current list of 
sensitive CYP3A-metabolized medications and CYP3A-metabolized medications with a narrow therapeutic 
range is available at the Indiana University, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, website 
(http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/clinical-table/).[31]

Clinical Study Protocol AL N-AS1-002 givosiran  (ALN -AS1) 
Amendment 6 Summary of Changes  28 May  2019  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  4 Patients with porphyria could have altered hepatic heme synthesis, and treatment with ALN-AS1 could 
also modulate this pathway and secondarily impact CYP enzyme activity.  Results from a DDI study in 
AIP patients who are ASHE are presented in Section 1.6.4.  The DDI study demonstrated that ALN-AS1 
treatment resulted in weak to moderate reduction in activity in some of the CYP enzymes resulting in 
corresponding low to moderate increase in the plasma levels of drugs that are metabolized by these CYP 
enzymes.  Based on the moderate decrease in CYP2D6 or CYP1A2 activity, investigators will review all 
concomitant medications that are primarily metabolized by these enzymes and monitor the patient’s 
clinical response to these medications during the study.  Medications metabolized primarily 
by CYP2D6 
and CYP1A2 with a narrow therapeutic index 
(ie that require regular laboratory monitoring) 
may need 
to be monitored more frequently to determine if a dose adjustment of the concomitant medication is 
required.  For patients who require new medications while on study, selection of medications that are not 
primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 or CYP1A2 should be considered.  Refer to the individual product’s 
prescription information to determine if there is a need to monitor concomitant medications for 
differences in safety or efficacy of the medication based on reported DDIs with CYP2D6 or CYP1A2.  
For more detailed and up-t o-date information on CYP substrates, see: 
https://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/developmentresources/
druginteractionslabeling/ucm093664.htm. 
Purpose:  Extend treatment duration so that patients may continue on treatment for up to 48 months . 
The primary change occurs in Section  4.2, Duration of Treatment and Study . 
Formerly read:  The duration of treatment is up to 36 months.  The estimated total time on study, inclusive of 
Screening/Baseline, for each patient is up to 44 months. 
Now reads:  The duration of treatment is up to 4836 months.  The estimated total time on study, inclusive of 
Screening/Baseline, for each patient is up to 4456 months.

Section 11.2, Table 5  (Table 6 added)
Purpose:  Section 9.1.3, Serious Breach of Protocol, was added to align with the process for the reporting potential serious breaches of protocol . 
The primary change is the addition of Section  9.1.3 , Serious Breach of Protocol  
Added text : 9.1.3.  Serious Breach of Protocol  
Investigators must notify the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of becoming aware of a potential serious breach of 
the protocol.  A serious bre ach is a breach that is likely to affect to a significant degree the safety and rights of a 
study participant or the reliability and robustness of the data generated in the clinical trial.  
Purpose:  Because data from the human drug -drug interaction study  showed that givosiran treatment resulted in a moderate (>2 -fold) reduction 
of CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 metabolic activity, the guidance for investigators in Section  6.3 was updated to recommend that medications metabolized 
primarily by CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 with a n arrow therapeutic index may need to be monitored more frequently to determine if a dose adjustment 
of the concomitant medication is required.  In the absence of comprehensive lists of products metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP1A 2, Section  6.3 
now directs the I nvestigator to the product information of any concomitant medication required and to the Table of Substrates for CYP enzymes on 
the FDA Website to determine if concomitant medications metabolized primarily by CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 need to be monitored more frequently.   
Section 11.2, List of Sensitive CYP3A Substrates and Those with a Narrow Therapeutic Range, was deleted because , based on the results from the 
human drug -drug interaction study, givosiran treatment results in only a weak (<2 -fold) reduction of CYP3A4 metabolic activity, and the 
recommendation to monitor the drug response in patients on medications primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 was not considered nec essary.  
The primary change occurs in Section  11.3, List of Sensitive CYP3A Substrates and Those  with a Narrow Therapeutic Range . 
Section  11.3 was deleted.  
Purpose:  Correct typographical errors, punctuation, grammar, abbreviations, and formatting

Study Design  
This is a multicenter, open -label extension study to evaluate the long -term safety and clinical activity 
of ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP  who completed study ALN -AS1-001. 
The last assessments performed, determining previous study (ALN -AS1-001) completion, will serve as 
the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed since the last 
assessment, safety asse ssments will be repeated before administration of ALN -AS1.  It is anticipated 
that patients will begin ALN -AS1 administration in this study within 6 months after the last dose of 
study drug in the previous study.  Eligibility will be confirmed before admin istration of the first dose of 
ALN -AS1 (Day 1).  Patients will undergo assessments at the clinical study center every month for the 
first 3 months.  Then, through Month 6, and according to the dosing regimen selected, assessments will 
take place at the cli nical study center or via a phone contact (for an every month dosing regimen, visits 
will be every month; for an every 3 months dosing regimen, visits will be every 3 months).  After a 
patient has completed 12 months of ALN -AS1 administration in this study  (6 months in an every 
month dosing regimen), and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, 
study procedures, including ALN -AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s home by a 
healthcare professional.  Study procedu res may occur at the patient’s home at the discretion of the 
Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit 
at the clinical study center every 3 months for the first year, and thereafter every 6 months through the 
end of the treatment period.  Additional visits to collect clinical laboratory samples may occur at home 
at any point during the treatment period, within 14 days prior to scheduled dose administration.  
Patients will return to the clinic al study center for a posttreatment follow -up visit after administration 
of the last dose of ALN -AS1.  An ALA/PBG Monitoring/EOS visit will be conducted either at the 
clinical study center or via phone contact, unless treatment continues with ALN -AS1. 
Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain assessments, 
and narcotic use.  Patients will also be provided with laboratory sample collection kits and instructions 
for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center.  
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review safety and tolerability data collected during the study 
with the primary purpose of protecting the safety of patients participating in the study.  
Number of Planned Patients  
Up to 24 patien ts are planned for enrollment in this study (including optional cohorts in 
ALN -AS1-001). 
Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria  
Patients with AIP, who have completed Part C of study ALN -AS1-001, will be eligible for screening in 
this study.  Eligible pat ients will not be on a scheduled regimen of hemin to prevent porphyria attacks 
at Screening.  Patients with alanine transaminase ≥2.0× upper limit of normal, total bilirubin ≥2 mg/dL 
(unless bilirubin elevation is due to Gilbert’s syndrome), or estimated g lomerular filtration rate ≤30 
mL/min/1.73 m2 (using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) at Screening are not 
eligible for this study.  
Investigational Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
ALN -AS1 Solution for Injection (subcutaneous use [SC]) is comprised of a synthetic, small interfering 
RNA targeting ALAS1 and bearing a triantennary N -acetyl galactosamine ligand conjugated to the 
sense strand, formulated in phosphate buffer.   
The study starting  dose and regimen of ALN -AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg as an SC injection administered every 3 
months.  Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may approve changes to the dosing regimen,

 6 including decreases in the dose level and changes in the dosing frequency.  Howev er any dose and 
dosing regimen will not exceed a previously explored dose level or frequency that was determined to 
be safe and well -tolerated in study ALN -AS1-001, SRC, Health Authority and Ethics Committee 
approval must be sought prior to dose escalation  above 5.0 mg/kg in accordance with local Regulatory 
requirements.  
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Not applicable  
Duration of Treatment and Study  
The duration of treatment is up to 36 months.  The estimated total time on study, inclu sive of 
Screening/Baseline, for each patient is up to 44 months.  
Statistical Methods  
Statistical analyses will be primarily descriptive.  Incidence of AEs will be summarized by maximum 
severity and relationship to ALN -AS1.  Incidence of and serious advers e events (SAEs) and AEs 
leading to discontinuation will also be tabulated.  By -patient listings will be provided for deaths, SAEs, 
and events leading to discontinuation.  
Laboratory shift tables from baseline to worst values will be presented.  Abnormal ph ysical 
examination findings and electrocardiogram data will be presented in by -patient listings.  Descriptive 
statistics will be provided for electrocardiogram interval data and presented as both actual values and 
changes from baseline relative to each on study evaluation and to the last evaluation on -study.  
Clinical activity of ALN -AS1 will be summarized primarily by descriptive statistics.  The clinical 
activity of ALN -AS1 will be evaluated by the frequency and characteristics of porphyria attacks 
includi ng duration, treatment, and severity of porphyria attacks and number and duration of visits to a 
health care setting for acute porphyria care.  Patient diary recordings, including BPI -SF questionnaire 
scores, will also be summarized.   
PD analysis will inc lude the evaluation of change in ALA, PBG, and ALAS mRNA levels.  Descriptive 
statistics (eg, mean and standard error of the mean) for observed levels of PD parameters and the 
relative change from baseline will be presented for each of the postdose follow -up time points.  
The PK concentration of ALN -AS1 will be determined.  Antidrug antibody results will be tabulated 
overall and by previous treatment in the previous study (ALN -AS1-001).  A by -patient listing will also 
be provided.  
Additional exploratory anal yses may be conducted on analytes related to targeting the heme 
biosynthesis pathway.  Quality of life scores will also be summarized.

a Patients are not required to complete Screening/Baseline assessments if the assessments in the previous study (ALN -AS1-001) were completed within 60 days 
of administration of the first dose of ALN -AS1 in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed since  the last assessment, clinical laboratory tests and ECGs 
will be repeated before administration of ALN -AS1.  Results should be available and deemed acceptable before the administration of the first dose of ALN -
AS1.  On Day 1, results from hematology, chemi stry (including LFTs), and coagulation tests collected within the prior 14 days must be reviewed by the

may be used for review in order to allow same day study drug administration and additional samples for central analysis must also be collected.  
b After a patient has completed 12 months of ALN -AS1 administration in this study, and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, 
study procedures, including ALN -AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional.  Study procedures may occur at  the
patient’s home at the discretion of the Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to com plete at least 1 visit at the clinical
study center Q6M.  Additional visits to collect c linical laboratory samples may occur a t home at any point during the treatment period, within 14 days prior to 
scheduled dose administration.  
c See Section 7.1 for details on the interval medical history/disease history to be recorded at Screening/Baseline.  Ongoing AEs from the previous study 
(ALN -AS1-001) will be captured as medical history.  
d A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening/Baseline, and D1.  At all other visits, a targeted physical ex amination will be performed.  On 
dosing days, the physical examination will b e performed predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, the physical examination can occur at any time 
during the visit.  See Section  7.5.3  for details on the physical examination.  
e Height will be measured at Screening/Baseline only.  
f Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate.  On D1, vital signs will be collected  within 1 hour predose; and 2 hours  
(±10 minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, vital signs 
can be collected at any time during the visit.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or su pine position (should be consistent for each patient), after the 
patient has rested comfortably for at least 10 minutes.  
g Using central ECG equipment, triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine position after the patient has rested comfortably for at least 5 
minutes.  For patients receiving ≤2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1, ECGs will be performed within 1 hour predose and 2 hours (±15 minutes) postdose at a minimum of 2
of the following visits:  D1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 15 (o nly if visit is done at clinic), or Month 18.  In patients receiving >2.5 mg/kg 
ALN -AS1, ECGs will be performed within 1 hour predose an d 4 hours (±20 minutes) postdose at a  minimum of two of the following visits:  D1, Month 3, 
Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 15 (only if visit is done at clinic), or Month 18.  On all other dosing days, ECGs will be collected within 1 hour pred ose 
(see Section  7.5.4  for ECG assessment details).   
h Clinical laboratory parameters are described in Section  7.5.5 .  On dosing days, blood samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected predose.  On 
days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, blood samples can be collected at any time during the visit. On dosing days, results from hematology, ch emistry 
(including LFTs), and coagulation tests collected within the prior 14 days must be reviewed by the Investigator before study drug administration.  If results 
from within the prior 14 days are not available at a dosing visit, locally analyzed predose a ssessments may be used for review in order to allow same day study 
drug administration  and additional samples for central analysis  must  also be collected.  
i A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening/Baseline; thereafter, urine pregnancy tests  will be performed.  Results must be available before dosing.  
j ALN -AS1 will be administered by SC injection according to the Pharmacy Manual.  See Section  6.2.2  for ALN -AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  For 
weight -based dosing, weight measured at the current study center visit ( dosing day ) will be used to calculate the dose of ALN -AS1 through M12.  After M12, 
weight measured at either the previous study center visit or the current study center visit  may be used to calculate the weight -based dose of ALN -AS1. 
k Spot urine samples will be collected for measurement of ALA, PBG, and creatinine levels.  On dosing days, samples should be c ollected predose.  
l On dosing days, blood and urine samples for ALAS1 mRNA (and possible biomarker) analysis will be collected within 1 hour predose . 
m Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points listed in  Table 3 (Appendix Section  11.1).  Blood sample collection for PK analysis at 
Month 9 and Month  15 is only necessary if ECG will be performed at same visit.  
n On dosing days, blood samples for antidrug antibody analysis should be collected within 1 hour predose.  
oPorphyria attack laboratory sample collection kits should be dispensed at the screening visit along with instructions for use. For an y attack that occurs through
M37 , urine samples should be collected within 24 hours of the start of clinical intervention (eg, hemin or glucose administratio n) and within 24 hours of the end
of clinica l intervention.  If patients are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laboratory sample c ollection kits will be provided

 20 1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Disease Overview  
The porphyrias are a family of rare metabolic disorders predominately caused by a genetic 
mutation in 1 of the 8 enzymes responsible for heme synthesis. [1]  The 2 major categories are 
erythropoietic and hepatic, depending on the major site of expression of the underlying enzyme 
deficiency .[2]  In addition, the porphyrias are classified as acute if patients present with 
neurovisceral symptoms (eg, abdominal pain and neurologic symptoms) or cutaneous if they 
present with dermal blistering or photosensitivit y.[3, 4]   
This study will include patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), the most common acute  
hepatic porphyria (AHP).  AIP occurs as a result of an autosomal dominant mutation leading to 
partial deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), the third enzyme in the heme 
biosynthesis pathway .[5]  The rate limiting step in heme synthesis is the upstream enzyme 
5-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1), which is controlled by feedback repression via the 
end-product heme.  In response to a decrease in endogenous heme in the liver, as can occur w ith 
fasting, hormonal alterations, or with cytochrome P450 (CYP) inducing drugs, ALAS1 is 
induced, resulting in increased flux through the heme synthesis pathway.  In patients with AIP, 
this can result in the marked accumulation of the toxic heme intermedi ates porphobilinogen 
(PBG) and delta aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in the blood and urine due to the deficiency in the 
downstream PBGD.  Clinically, this manifests as acute attacks characterized by severe 
abdominal pain, cardiovascular as well as neurologic an d psychiatric dysfunction. [6] 
1.1.1.  Epidemiology  
Over 370 mutations have been identified in the PBGD gene, which in most instances result in its 
reduction by approximately  50%.  The exact prevalence of AIP is unknown due to under 
diagnosis, variation by geographic region, and the differences in penetrance observed for the 
different mutations .[2]  However, it is estimated that the prevalence of AIP is 5 to 10 per 100,000 
people in Western countries, while in Sweden it occurs in 1 in 1,000 people due to a founder 
effect associated with the resultant G593A mutation .[7-10]  AIP shows incomplete penetrance 
and on average only 10% to 50% of carriers with a mutation present with clinical symptoms. [11]  
It has been proposed that unknown inherited co -factors, in addition to PBGD mutations, may 
explain why a small percentage of patients present with much more severe disease while the 
majority remain asymptomatic.  
Patients with AIP present with acute attacks characterized by neurovisceral symptoms and signs 
including severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or less commonly diarrhea, 
hypertension, tachycardia, fever, muscle weakness, as well as neurolo gical (eg, neuropathy, 
seizures) and psychiatric (eg, anxiety and confusion) manifestations .[12]  AIP attacks typically 
start after puberty and can be triggered by exogenous factors such as medications (especially 
barbiturates, sulfonamides, and hydantoins), stress, exogenous hormones, nutritional status, and 
infection.  Clinically active disease is more common in women, where attacks often occur around 
the menstrual cycle and are likely precipitated by hormonal changes.  
Many AIP patients remain undiagnosed given that the disease is rare and characterized by 
non-specific symptoms (eg, abdominal pain a nd nausea). [2]  The initial diagnosis involves 
demonstrating elevated urinary PBG (typically 20 -50 × normal reference range) and ALA 
256
ALN -AS1 (givosiran)    Clinical Study Protoc ol ALN -AS1-002 
Amendment 5   03 May  2018

 21 (typically 5 -20 × normal reference range) when the patien t is having acute attack symptoms.  
Once a test is positive for elevated ALA and PBG and porphyria is suspected, genetic testing for 
a PBGD mutation is performed.   
There are 4 main clinical phenotypes of AIP.  Latent gene carriers have never had an acute attack 
and are biochemically inactive (normal urinary ALA and PBG).  Asymptomatic high excreters 
(ASHE) do not have current acute attacks, but are biochemically active (increased urinary ALA 
and PBG).  The increased levels of ALA and PBG in ASHE patients a re lower than those in AIP 
patients during an acute attack, but are still significantly higher than normal reference values. [6-
8]  Sporadic attack patients have infr equent acute attacks.  Recurrent attack patients have ≥4 
attacks per year requiring hospitalization or treatment by a medical professional. [7] 
1.1.2.  Current Management and Unmet Medical Need  
Management of acute attacks often requires hospitalization.  Patients are initially treated with 
supportive care and carbohydrate loading, analgesics and anti -emetics, and remova l of known 
precipitating factors. [13]  In patients with moderate to severe attacks, or who fail to respond to 
supportive measures, treatment with intravenous (IV) hemin (daily for 3 -5 days) is commenced.  
Symptoms typically begin to improve after 2 to 5 days of hemin treatment, accompanied by a 
lowering of urinary ALA and PBG levels to below or at the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
reference value; however, in some patients attacks can last several weeks, requiring pro longed 
hemin use and hospitalization. [14]  With prolonged and severe attacks, cranial nerve 
involvement can occur, leading to bulbar paralysis, respiratory failure, and death .[15]  
Hemin, a blood derived therapy, was approved as Normosang® (heme arginate) in the European 
Union (EU) and as Panhematin® (lyophilised hematin) in the United States (US) in 1999 and 
1983, respectively. [16, 17]  In the EU, heme arginate is indicated for the treatment of acute 
attacks of hepatic porphyria (eg, AIP, variegate porphyria, and hereditary coproporphyria); 
whereas, in the US lyophilized hemin is limited to the amelioration of recurrent attacks of AIP 
temporally related to the menstrual cycle.  Approval of both products was based on biochemical 
efficacy (ie, lowering of ALA and PBG) as well as data from uncontrolled case series and case 
reports .[18-22]  Hemin side effects include thrombophlebitis, transient anticoagulation, and in 
rare cases, anaphylaxis or renal failure .[22-24]  In addition, hemin administration requires a large 
vein for administration, often necessitating central venous access.  
While the majority of patients who experience attacks have them sporadicall y, it is estimated that 
up to 1,000 AIP patients experience recurrent attacks (typically defined as ≥4 per year) in the US 
and EU combined .[25]  While hemin is curren tly only approved to ameliorate acute attacks, it is 
administered prophylactically in some patients with recurrent attacks (eg, administered every 1 -2 
weeks). [26]  Potential problems associated with chronic hemin administration include infusion 
site phlebitis, iron overload, and the need for chronic IV access and asso ciated complications (eg, 
risk of infection or occlusion). [5]  In addition, there have been reports of a decrease in efficacy 
with chronic hemin administration, as evidenced by the need to increase t he frequency or dosage 
of hemin prophylaxis over time in attempt to maintain a clinical effect. [27]  In patients with very 
severe recurrent attacks, or in whom hemin treatment is not effective, liver transplantation can be 
curative; however, organ transplantation is a high -risk procedure and is rarely used as a treatment 
option [34].   Given the significant morbidity and mortality, there remains a signific ant unmet 
257
ALN -AS1 (givosiran)    Clinical Study Protoc ol ALN -AS1-002 
Amendment 5   03 May  2018 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  
 22 need for an efficacious, simple, fast -acting and better tolerated treatment for acute or prevent 
recurrent attacks in patients with AIP.  
1.2. RNA Interference  
RNA interference (RNAi) is a naturally occurring cellular mechanism mediated by small 
interf ering RNAs (siRNAs) for regulating gene expression.  Typically, synthetic siRNAs are 19 
to 25 base pair double stranded oligonucleotides in a staggered duplex with a 2 -nucleotide 
overhang at both or 1 of the 3’ ends .[28]  Such siRNAs can be designed to target an endogenous 
messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript of a given gene.  When introduced into cells, the net effect 
of an RNA i-based pharmacological approach is the binding of the siRNA to its complementary 
mRNA sequence, cleavage of this target mRNA, and reduction of synthesis of the target protein, 
resulting in a decrease of the target protein levels. [29]  The ability to selectively and potently 
degrade the mRNA encoding the ALAS1 protein (thereby decreasing accumulation of the toxic 
intermediates ALA and PBG) using an siRNA is a novel approach for the prevention and 
treatment of acute attacks in patients with AIP.   
1.3. ALN -AS1 
ALN -AS1 ( givosiran ) comprises a synthetic siRNA covalently linked to a GalNAc containing 
ligand (ALN60519), specific for ALAS1 and formulated for administration via subcutaneous 
(SC) injection. ALN -60519 has a target region between nucl eotide 918 to 937 of the ALAS1 
mRNA. Attachment to a triantennary GalNAc ligand to the siRNA enables its distribution to the 
liver (which is the primary site of ALAS1 synthesis), followed by intracellular delivery to 
hepatocytes via ASGPR, resulting in eng agement of the RNAi pathway and suppression of 
hepatic ALAS1 protein synthesis.  
ALN -AS1 is currently in development for treatment of acute attacks in patients with AIP, the 
most common AHP.  
Further information on ALN -AS1, including the clinical and nonclin ical experience to date, is 
available in in the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
1.4. Study Design Rationale  
This is a multicenter, open -label extension study designed to evaluate the long -term safety and 
clinical activity of subcutaneously administered ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP who have 
completed clinical study ALN -AS1-001.  The primary endpoint for the study is the incidence of 
AEs.  
1.5. Dose Rationale  
Clinical data from Part A and Part B of the ongoing study ALN -AS1-001 demonstrate that sing le 
(0.035 -2.5 mg/kg) and multiple (0.35 -1.0 mg/kg) doses of ALN -AS1 have been generally 
well-tolerated in patients with AIP who are ASHE.  Additionally, data from this study indicate 
that a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1 results in near normalization of urine ALA and PBG 
levels, which is sustained for approximately 14 weeks.   
Patients in Part C of the ongoing study ALN -AS1-001 who are eligible for participation in this 
study will likely require a higher dose of ALN -AS1 to normalize ALA and PBG as they ha ve 
258
ALN -AS1 (givosiran)   Clinical Study Protoc ol ALN -AS1-002 
Amendment 5   03 May  2018 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  
23 higher levels of ALAS1 upregulation and higher baseline levels of ALA and PBG, when 
compared to patients with AIP who are ASHE. [30]  For example, based on prel iminary data in 
Part A and Part B of the ALN -AS1-001 study, the mean PBG level of patients who are ASHE is 
21.9 mmol/mol Cr (N=28); whereas, in Part C of this study in patients with AHP who have 
recurrent porphyria attacks, the mean PBG level is approximat ely 49.3 mmol/mol Cr (N=12).  
The study starting dose and regimen of ALN -AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg as an SC injection administered 
every 3 months.  Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may approve changes to the ALN -
AS1 dosing regimen, including decreases in the  dose level and changes in dosing frequency.  
However, any dosing regimen will not exceed a previously explored dose level or frequency that 
was determined to be safe and well -tolerated in study ALN -AS1-001. SRC, Health Authority and 
Ethics Committee appro val must be sought prior to dose level escalation above 5.0 mg/kg in 
accordance with local Regulatory requirements.  
The study starting dose and regimen was selected based on the benefit:risk profile of ALN -AS1 
in Part C of the ongoing ALN -AS1-001 study.  P reliminary data to date indicate that 
administration of 5.0 mg/kg ALN -AS1 has been generally well -tolerated.  There have been no 
study drug -related serious adverse events  (SAEs ), severe AEs, or clinically significant changes in 
safety parameters.  While a single 2.5 mg/kg dose of ALN -AS1 has also been generally well -
tolerated when administered to patients in Part A and Part C of study ALN -AS1-001, this dose 
has not resulted in near normalization of ALA and PBG levels.  In addition, while emerging data 
from Part C indicate that an every 3 months dose of 2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1 demonstrated some 
clinical activity (eg, decrease in attack frequency and decrease in heme use), some patients 
continued to experience breakthrough porphyria attacks during the treatment peri od, indicating 
that a higher dose may be required.  
The duration of dosing in this study is supported by the overall favorable safety profile of 
ALN -AS1 in the ongoing clinical study ALN -AS1-001 and the absence of new findings in 
nonclinical studies with ALN-AS1. 
1.6. Clinical Data Summary  
1.6.1.  Clinical Pharmacodynamics 
Dosing has been completed in Part A and Part B of the study.  In both Parts A and B of the study, 
durable and dose -dependent reductions of ALAS1 mRNA (up to 66% in the 2.5 mg/kg dose 
group) as measure d by cERD  were observed after ALN -AS1 treatment.  ALAS1 reductions were 
highly correlated with reductions in ALA (mean maximal 86%) PBG (mean maximal 95%) 
levels in a dose -dependent manner and were sustained for ≥180 days. 
Dosing is currently ongoing in Part C of the study. The mean maximal reduction in ALAS1 
mRNA relative to baseline in ALN-AS1-treated patients in Cohort 1 (2.5 mg/kg Q3M) was 39% 
and in Cohort 2 (2.5 mg/kg Q1M) 66%.  All patients treated wit h ALN-AS1 also had decreases 
in their peak ALA and PBG levels in the treatment period compared to the run-in period, along 
with reduced fluctuations in these levels in the treatment period (data not shown). No reductions 
were observed in the placebo-treated patients.

 24 1.6.2.  Clinical Activity  
Clinical activity  was not evaluated in Parts A and B of the study because ASHE patients included 
in this study were not actively experiencing attacks of porphyria.  
Dosing is currently ongoing in Part C of the study. All patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 were enrolled 
in a run -in phase for 10 -15 weeks that was followed by a treatment phase for up to 24 weeks.  No 
investigational product was administered during the run -in phase.  Therefore, each patient acted 
as their own control, allowing for individual ALA / PBG levels, and overa ll attack rate while on 
ALN -AS1 treatment to be compared to that observed in the run -in phase.   
Figure 1 shows in Cohort 1 ALN -AS1-treated patients th ere was a 74% mean decrease in the 
annualized attack rate for the treatment period versus the run -in period (range: 63 -94% 
reduction), compared with a 23% decrease in the annualized attack rate for the placebo -treated 
patient.  In ALN -AS1-treated patients this was accompanied by an approximate 76% mean 
decrease in annualized acute hemin usage (range 52 -95%) and a 10.3 times increase in the 
maximal attack free interval compared to run -in period (range 4.2 -16.3).

Run-in 
 
Figure 2 shows in Cohort 2 ALN -AS1-treated patients, there was a  58% mean decrease in the 
annualized attack rate for the treatment period versus the run -in period (range: 45 -76% 
reduction).  This compares favorably with data from the placebo -treated patient who showed a 
34% reduction in the annualized attack rate for t he treatment period versus the run -in period.  In 
ALN -AS1-treated patients, the reduction in attack rate was accompanied by a 92% mean 
decrease in annualized hemin usage (range 84 -100%) and a 2.7x increase in the mean maximal 
attack free interval compared to run -in period (range 2.1 -3.2).

1.6.3.  Clinical Safety  
In Part A and Part B of Study ALN -AS1-001, a total of 11 patients (11/13;  85.0%) who received 
ALN -AS1 reported at least 1 AE.  All 5 placebo -treated patients (5/5; 100%) reported at least 1 
AE.  AEs considered possibly or definitely related to ALN -AS1 were reported in 5 patients 
(5/13; 38%): diarrhoea, dyspepsia, hematochezia, injection site erythema, injection site pain, 
blood creatinine increased, glomerular filtration rate decreased, and hypoesthesia (each AE 
reported only by an individual patient; 1/13; 8% each).  There were 2 SAEs of abdominal pain: 1 
patient each in the 0. 035 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg ALN -AS1 dose groups.  Both were considered to 
be not related and resolved without sequelae.  There were no AEs leading to discontinuation.  All 
AEs were mild or moderate in severity, except for 1 of the SAEs of abdominal pain (0.10 mg/kg 
dose group), which was considered severe. Adverse events related to abnormal laboratory values 
were seen in 1 patient in the 0.35 mg/kg ALN -AS1 dose group who had AEs of ALT increased 
and AST increased, which were moderate and considered by the Inves tigator to be unrelated to 
ALN -AS1.  No clinically significant findings were observed with routine monitoring of CRP and 
a panel of 9 proinflammatory cytokines collected predose and up to 24 hours post -dose.  There 
were no other clinically significant labo ratory abnormalities related to study drug or changes in 
vital signs, or ECGs in patients who were administered ALN AS1 or placebo.  
Dosing is ongoing in Part C of the study. All patients who received ALN -AS1 in cohort 1 and 2 
reported at least 1 AE.  AEs t hat were reported in at least 2 subjects were nausea in 3 patients 
(50%) and abdominal pain, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, headache, cough and oropharyngeal pain 
in 2 patients (33.3%) each.  All AEs were mild or moderate in severity.  AEs considered possibly 
or definitely related to ALN -AS1 were reported in 4 patients (66.6%), 1 each:  renal impairment 
in Cohort 1 and injection site reaction, myalgia, and headache in Cohort 2. Both placebo -treated 
patients reported AEs.  No AE was experienced in more than 1 pa tient.  
In Part C, Cohort 1 or 2, there were no SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation in patients 
administered ALN -AS1 or placebo. No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities related to 
study drug or changes in vital signs, ECG, or physical exam fi ndings were observed in patients 
administered ALN -AS1 or placebo.  
Part C Cohort 3 5.0 mg/kg SC monthly dosing is ongoing.  In this cohort there was one fatal 
SAE of acute pancreatitis, which was determined to be unlikely related to study drug or placebo 
261
ALN -AS1 (givosiran)    Clinical Study Protoc ol ALN -AS1-002 
Amendment 5   03 May  2018

 26 by the Investigator due to the presence of gall bladder sludge found at the time of her 
presentation.  Contributors to this patient's adverse clinical course included: pre -existing chronic 
debilitation from recurrent AIP attacks requiring monthly hospitaliza tion, porphyria -attributed 
quadriplegia requiring nursing home care, delay in hospital admission and complications from 
thromboembolism (multiple risk factors included pancreatitis, obesity, immobilisation from 
quadriparesis and recent hospitalization for infected portacath removal).  Serum lipase was added 
to all scheduled laboratory assessments in November 2016 as part of additional safety 
monitoring. To date, all lipase results (available in 11 of 15 subjects) have been at or below the 
upper limit of nor mal with no trends seen with dosing of study drug or placebo.  
Further information on the safety, efficacy, PK and PD of ALN -AS1 are available in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.7. Benefit -Risk Assessment  
Patients participating in this study may experience a reduced number or severity of porphyria 
attacks, reduced treatment with IV hemin, and/or reduced requirement for pain medication.  As 
presented in Section  1.6, emerging data  demonstrate that patients given ALN -AS1 experienced 
reduced ALA/PBG levels, decreased attack frequency and reduced heme usage in the 24 -week 
treatment period compared to the 12 -week run -in period in Study ALN -AS1-001 
As detailed in Section  1.6, a fatal SAE of hemorrhagic pancreatitis was reported but deemed to 
be unlikely related to study drug.  However, the potentially non -adverse nonclinical finding of 
angiectasis in the islets o f Langerhans (endocrine, not exocrine region) of the rat pancreas (see 
Investigator Brochure), do not exclude a potential association between ALN -AS1 and the SAE of 
hemorrhagic pancreatitis.  
The important potential risks associated with administration of ALN-AS1 in patients with AIP 
are as follows:  
 Injection site reactions (ISRs):  ALN -AS1 is administered by SC injection.  In the 
ongoing ALN -AS1 clinical study, AEs of ISRs have been infrequently reported and 
have been mild to moderate in severity with singl e dosing.  Injection site rotation and 
close monitoring have been implemented in ALN -AS1 clinical studies to reduce the 
potential for ISRs.  
 Pancreatitis : Since an association between ALN -AS1 and the fatal SAE of 
hemorrhagic pancreatitis can not be ruled o ut, patients will undergo routine 
monitoring of systemic and pancreatic inflammation and coagulation throughout the 
study.  Hematology, chemistry and coagulation results are required to be available 
prior to each dose.  
 Liver transaminase  abnormalities:  As  ALN -AS1 is targeted for delivery to the liver, 
and reversible hepatic changes were observed in some animal species, there is a 
potential for development of liver function test ( LFT) abnormalities.  To minimize the 
potential for LFT abnormalities, patients  are required to have adequate liver function 
at study entry and LFTs are monitored during the study.  
 Anaphylactic reactions :  There is a potential risk of developing a severe allergic 
reaction with ALN -AS1 administration.  In the present study, one patien t in the 
262
ALN -AS1 (givosiran)    Clinical Study Protoc ol ALN -AS1-002 
Amendment 5   03 May  2018 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  
 27 2.5 mg/kg monthly dose group with a history of asthma and multiple allergies 
experienced an SAE of anaphylactic reaction  that was determined by the Investigator 
to be definitely related to study drug given the temporal relationship of ALN -AS1 
treatment to the onset of the reaction ( within minutes).  The patient was treated and 
recovered and was discontinued from the study.   Guidance on dose administration 
and monitoring for anaphylactic reactions has  been included in this protocol.  
The complete sum mary of the clinical and nonclinical data relevant to the investigational drug 
and its study in human subjects is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.

4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.1. Summary of Study Design  
This is a Phase 1/2 multice nter, open -label extension study to evaluate the long -term safety and 
clinical activity of ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP who completed study ALN -AS1-001.  The 
study will be conducted at up to 8 clinical study centers worldwide.  
The last assessments performe d, determining previous study (ALN -AS1-001) completion, will 
serve as the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed 
since the last assessment, safety assessments (eg, ECG and clinical laboratory tests) will be 
repeate d before administration of ALN -AS1.  It is anticipated that patients will begin ALN -AS1 
administration in this study within 6 months after the last dose of study drug in the previous 
study.  Eligibility will be confirmed during Screening/Baseline and befor e administration of the 
first dose of ALN -AS1 (Day 1).  Patients will undergo assessments at the clinical study center 
every month for the first 3 months.  Then, through Month 6, and according to the dosing regimen 
selected, assessments will take place at the clinical study center or via a phone contact (for an 
every month dosing regimen, visits will be every month; for an every 3 months dosing regimen, 
visits will be every 3 months; see Section  6.2.2 ).  After a patient has completed 12 months of 
ALN -AS1 administration in this study (6 months in an every month dosing regimen), and where 
applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, study procedures, including 
ALN -AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional (as 
indicated in the Schedules of Assessments in  Table 1 and Table 2 ; and Table 4 and Table 5 in 
Appendix Section  11.2).  Study procedures may occur at the patient’s home at the discretion of 
the Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at 
least 1 visit at the  clinical study center every 3 months for the first year, and thereafter every 6 
months through the end of the treatment period.  Additional visits to collect c linical laboratory 
samples may occur at home at any point during the treatment period, within 14  days prior to 
scheduled dose administration.  Patients will return to the clinical study center for a 
posttreatment follow -up visit after administration of the last dose of ALN -AS1.  An ALA/PBG 
Monitoring/EOS visit will be conducted either at the clinical  study center or via phone contact, 
unless treatment continues with ALN -AS1. 
Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain 
assessments, and narcotic use.  Additionally, patients will be encouraged to report to  the clinical 
study center if they experience a porphyria attack through Month 3 7.  In the event that patients 
are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laboratory sample 
collection kits containing instructions for collec ting and sending urine samples to the clinical 
study center, if possible, will be provided.  Patients will be contacted by phone after a porphyria

 29 attack to record attack details.  If patients are experiencing signs and symptoms of a porphyria 
attack when ALN -AS1 administration is scheduled, the Investigator will determine whether 
administration of ALN -AS1 is appropriate.  If patients are treated for a porphyria attack at a 
health care facility (eg, hospital, emergency department, infusion center, or outpat ient clinic) 
other than the clinical study center, copies of medical records, including discharge summaries, 
will be requested.   
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review safety and tolerability data collected during the 
study with the primary purpose o f protecting the safety of patients participating in the study (see 
Section  4.6). 
Figure 3: Study Design  
 
4.2. Duration of Treatment and Study  
The duration of treatment is up to 36 months.  The estimated total time on study, inclusive of 
Screening/Baseline, for each patient is up to 44 months.   
4.3. Number of Patients  
Up to 24 patients are planned for enrollment in thi s study  (including optional cohorts in 
ALN -AS1-001). 
4.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups  
This is an open -label study; all p atients will receive ALN -AS1.  A combination of the clinical 
study center number and screening number will create the un ique patient identifier.  The clinical 
study center number will be assigned by the Sponsor.  Upon signing the Informed Consent Form 
(ICF), the patient will be assigned a screening number by the clinical study site, which will be 
the same unique patient ide ntifier assigned in the previous study (ALN -AS1-001).  The 
Investigator, or delegate, will confirm that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of 
the exclusion criteria.  
4.5. Blinding  
This is an open -label study, and all patients will receive ALN -AS1. 
4.6. Safety Review Committee  
An SRC will be involved in the conduct of this study.  The SRC has the responsibility for 
monitoring the safety of the study participants.  The SRC will perform periodic reviews of safety 
and tolerability data during the co urse of the clinical study at least every 3 months for the first 6

 31 5. Other medical conditions or comorbidities which, in the opinion of the Inve stigator, 
would interfere with study compliance or data interpretation  
5.3. Discontinuation of Study Drug and/or Study  
Patients or their legal guardians (in the case that the patient is a minor) are free to discontinue 
treatment and/or study or withdraw their c onsent at any time and for any reason, without penalty 
to their continuing medical care.  Any discontinuation of treatment or of the study must be fully 
documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF), and should be followed up by the 
Investigator.  T he Investigator may withdraw a patient from the study at any time if this is 
considered to be in the patient’s best interest.  
Discontinuation of study drug and withdrawal from the study are described in Section  5.3.1  and 
Section  5.3.2 , respectively.   If a patient stops participation from the stu dy or withdraws consent 
from the study, he/she will not be able to re -enroll in the study.  
5.3.1.  Discontinuation of Study Drug  
The Investigator or designee may discontinue dosing in a patient if the patient:  
 Is in violation of the protocol  
 Experiences a SAE cons idered to be possibly or definitely related to the study drug or 
an intolerable AE  
 Becomes pregnant  
 Is found to be considerably noncompliant with the protocol -requirements  
Patients who are pregnant will be discontinued from study drug dosing immediately ( see 
Section  7.5.6.6  for reportin g and follow -up of pregnancy).  A positive urine pregnancy test 
should be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test prior to discontinuing the study drug.  
If a patient discontinues dosing due to a serious adverse event (SAE), the SAE should be 
followed as described in Section  7.5.6 .  When a patient discontinues study drug dosing, the 
primary reason must be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  Patients who 
discontinue study drug and remain on study may receive treatment consistent with local standard 
pract ice for their disease per Investigator judgement, as applicable.  
Patients who discontinue treatment will be asked to comp lete an early termination  (ET) visit at 
which all Month 37 visit  procedures  will be performed; they must also  return for a safety -follow -
up visit 3 months (84 [+ 7] days) after their last dose of ALN -AS1. 
5.3.2.  Discontinuation from the Study  
A patient or their legal guardian may decide to stop the patient’s participation in the study at any 
time.  Patients considering to stop the study should be informed that they can discontinue 
treatment and complete study assessments including follow -up, as per the SOA, or alternatively 
may complete any minimal assessments for which the patient consents. The Investigator may 
withdraw  a patient at any time if this is considered to be in the patient’s best interest.  
However, study integrity and interpretation is best maintained if all randomized patients continue 
study assessments and follow -up.  Stopping study participation could mean:  
267

 32  If a patient discontinues from the study, he/she  will be asked to comp lete an early 
termination (ET) visit at which all Month 37 visit procedures  will be performed; 
the patient must also  return for a safety -follow -up visit at 3 months (84 [ +7] days) 
after his/her  last dose of ALN -AS1. 
 A patient can stop taking the study drug and stop study -related visits, but allow 
the investigator and study team to review the patient’s medical records, public 
records or be contacted in order to receive infor mation about the patient’s health  
When a patient stops the study, the discontinuation and reason for discontinuation must be 
recorded  in the appropriate section of the electronic case report form (eCRF) and all efforts will 
be made to complete and report t he observations as thoroughly as possible.  If a patient stops the 
study due to an adverse event (AE), including an SAE, the AE should be followed as described 
in Section  7.5.6 . 
If the patient wants to stop participation in the study, he/she should notify the study doctor in 
writing or in any other form that may be locally required. The personal data already collected 
during the study, including patient’s biological samples, will still be used together with the data 
collected on other patients in the study according to the informed consent and applicable laws.  
In addition to stopping participation in the study , the patient could decide to withdraw his/her 
consent as explained in Section  5.3.3  
5.3.3.  Withdrawal  of Consent to Collect and Process the Patient’s Pers onal Data  
The patient may decide to withdraw his/her consent informing the study doctor at any time in 
writing, or in any other form that may be locally required.  This  means that the patient wants to 
stop participation in the study and any further collect ion of his/her personal data.  
 The sponsor will continue to keep and use a patient's study information (including 
any data resulting from the analysis of the patient's biological samples until time 
of withdrawal) according to applicable law.  This is done to guarantee the validity 
of the study, determine the effects of the study treatment, and ensure 
completeness of study documentation.  
 The patient can also request that collected samples be destroyed or returned (to 
the extent it is permitted by applicable law) at any time.  
 Patients who withdraw th eir consent to collect and use personal d ata should 
understand that public records may be reviewed to determine the patient’s 
survival status as allowed per local and national regulations.    
In US and Japan, other wise, samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal may still be used 
for further testing/analysis in accordance with the terms of the protocol and of the informed 
consent form.  
In EU and rest of world, in any event, samples not yet analyzed at the ti me of withdrawal will 
not be used any longer, unless permitted by applicable law. They will be stored or destroyed 
according to applicable legal requirements.

Patients discontinuing from study drug or withdrawing from the study will  not be replaced.  
6. TREATMENTS  
6.1. Treatments Administered  
ALN -AS1 Solution for Injection (SC use) is a clear, colorless to pale yellow solution essentially 
free of particulates.  ALN -AS1 will be supplied by the Sponsor as a sterile solution for SC 
injection.  
Study drug supplied for this study must not be used for any purpose other than the present study 
and must not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study.  Study drug that has been 
dispensed to a patient and returned unused must not be re -dispens ed to a different patient.  
6.2. Investigational Study Drug  
Detailed information describing the preparation, handling, and storage, packaging and labeling, 
as well as study drug accountability for ALN -AS1 is provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.2.1.  Description  
ALN -AS1 S olution for Injection (SC use) is comprised of a synthetic, siRNA targeting ALAS1 
and bearing a triantennary GalNAc ligand conjugated to the sense strand, formulated in 
phosphate buffer.  
6.2.2.  Dose and Adm inistration 
The study starting dose of ALN-AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg ALN-AS1 as an SC injection administered 
every 3 mont hs (Table 1 and Table 2) . Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may approve 
changes to the ALN-AS1 dosing regimen, including decreases in the dose level and changes in 
dosing frequency (Table 4 and Table 5 in Appendix Section  11.2).  However, any dose and 
dosing regime n will not exceed a previously explored dose level or frequency that was 
determined to be safe and well-tolerated in study A
LN-AS1-001. SRC, Health Authority and 
Ethic
s Committee approval must be soug
ht prior to dose level escalation above 5.0 mg/kg in 
accordance with local Regulatory requirements.  See Section 6.2.3 for details on dose 
modifications. 
ALN -AS1 will be administered by a qualified and authorized health care professional trained in 
the recognition and management of anaphylactic reactions.  Th e study drug should be injected 
into the abdomen or upper arms or thighs.  Detailed instructions for study drug administration are 
presented in the Pharmacy Manual. As is consistent with good medical practice for subcutaneous 
drug administration, patients will be observed for a minimum of 20 minutes after each injection.   
Treatment for anaphylactic reactions should be readily available where patients are being dosed, 
and follow country and/or local hospital treatment guidelines  as shown in Table  7.[35] 
After a patient has completed 12 months of ALN -AS1 administration in this study (6 months in 
an every month dosing regimen),  study drug administration may be conducted at a location other 
than the study center by a home healthcare professional, where applicable country and local 
269
ALN -AS1 (givosiran)    Clinical Study Protoc ol ALN -AS1-002

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  
 34 regulations and infrastructure allow, after consultation with the medical monitor, during 
particular s tudy visits, as specified i n the Schedules of Assessments .  However, s tudy drug 
administration at the study center should be considered for patients who have ongoing study 
drug-related AEs or known risk factors for developing anaphylactic reaction, includi ng but not 
limited to: a prior history of anaphylactic reaction to food, medications or due to unknown 
etiology, worsening injection site reactions with repeat dosing, or anyone in the opinion of the 
investigator that would benefi t from clinical observatio n following  dosing.  Patients are required 
to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical study center every 3 months for the first year, and 
thereafter every 6 months through the end of the treatment period.   Additional visits to collect 
clinical laboratory  samples may occur at home at any point during the treatment period, within 
14 days prior to scheduled dose administration.  
If a patient does not receive a dose of ALN -AS1 within the specified dosing window, the 
Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor.  After such consultation, the dose may be 
administered or considered missed and not administered.  
Patients will be permitted to miss an occasional dose of study drug; however, if a patient misses 
2 consecutive doses, the Investigator, in consultat ion with the Medical Monitor, will discuss 
whether the patient will be able to continue on the study.  
Detailed instructions for study drug administration are found in the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.2.3.  Dose Modifications  
6.2.3.1.  Study Population Dose Modifications  
During the s tudy, dose modifications are permitted for the study population, or based on the dose 
cohort into which patients were originally randomized in study ALN -AS1-001.  Following SRC 
review of emerging safety and tolerability data from Part C of study ALN -AS1-001, or from this 
study (ALN -AS1-002), the dose and dosing regimen may be modified.  However, the dose and 
dosing regimen of ALN -AS1 will not exceed a previously explored dose and dosing regimen that 
was determined to be safe and well -tolerated in study ALN -AS1-001.  Patients enrolling in this 
study after a dose modification decision has been implemented may start at the newly identified 
dose and regimen.  
6.2.3.2.  Individual Dose Modifications  
Dose modifications are permitted for individual patients.  If a patient has  a study drug related AE 
of a recurrent ISR, severe ISR, or clinically significant LFT abnormality and the Investigator has 
concerns regarding further ALN -AS1 administration, the Medical Monitor and Investigator will 
review all available safety data for th e patient.  Based on this review, a dose reduction to half the 
previously administered dose (eg, a 5.0 mg/kg dose would be reduced to a 2.5 mg/kg dose) or a 
reduction in dosing frequency from monthly to every 3 months is permitted.  Subsequent ALN -
AS1 admi nistration at the previous dose may be considered based on the judgment of the 
Investigator and Medical Monitor.

 35 Reaction   
An anaphylactic reaction is a severe, potentially fatal , systemic allergic reaction with acute onset 
(minutes to hours).   For reference see Section  11.4.[35] 
Stop administering the study medication immediately  if an anaphylactic reaction to the study 
medication is suspected.  Study medication must be permanently discontinued in patients for 
whom an anaphylactic reaction is assessed as related to the study medication.  
Laboratory testing:  Obtain blood sample for tryptase, total IgE, and ADA  antidrug antibodies 
(ADA) ideally within 15 minutes to 3 hours after the onset of a suspected anaphylactic reaction; 
however, up to 6 hours is acceptable.  An additional blood sample to assess tryptase, total IgE, 
and ADA  should be obtained between  1 to 2 weeks from onset of event.  Local laboratory may 
be used to analyze samples; however, parallel samples should be sent to the central laboratory for 
analysis.  Sample collection and shipping instructions are included in the Laboratory Manual.  
Reporting : The PI or designee must notify the sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the 
occurrence of a suspected case  of anaphylactic reaction or being informed of the case as required 
for AEs of Clinical Interest (AECI) and SAE s, per AE reporting requirements (Section  7.5.6.1 ,  
Section  7.5.6.2  and 7.5.6.3 ). 
6.2.4.  Preparation, Handling, and Storage  
Staff at each clinical study cente r or the home healthcare professional will be responsible for 
preparation of ALN -AS1 doses, according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy Manual.  No 
special procedures for the safe handling of study drug are required.  
Study drug will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately 5±3°C.  Any deviation from 
the recommended storage conditions should be reported to the Sponsor and use of the study drug 
halted until authorization for its continued use has been provided by the Sponsor or designee.  
A Spo nsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, 
storage, dispensing procedures, and records.  
6.2.5.  Packaging and Labeling  
All packaging, labeling, and production of study drug will be in compliance with current Good 
Manufa cturing Practice specifications, as well as applicable local regulations.  Study drug labels 
and external packaging will include all appropriate information as pe r local labeling 
requirements.  
Additional details will be available in the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.2.6.  Accountability  
The Investigator or designee will maintain accurate records of receipt and the condition of the 
study drug supplied for this study, including dates of receipt.  In addition, accurate records will 
be kept of when and how much study drug is di spensed and administered to each patient in the 
study.  Any reasons for departure from the protocol dispensing regimen must also be recorded.  
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of all study drugs.  All used, 
partially used , and unused study drug will be returned to the Sponsor (or designee) or destroyed 
271

 36 at the clinical study center according to applicable regulations.   
Further instructions about drug accountability are detailed in the Pharmacy Manual.  
 
6.3. Concomitant Medications  
Use of concomitant medications will be recorded on the patient’s case report form (CRF) as 
indicated in the Schedules of Assessments ( Table 1 and Table 2 ; and Table 4 and Table 5 in 
Appe ndix Section  11.2).  This includes all prescription medications, herbal preparations, over the 
counter (OTC) medications, vitamins, and minerals.  Any changes in medications during the 
study will also be recor ded on the CRF.  
Any concomitant medication that is required for the patient’s welfare may be administered by the 
Investigator.  However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding 
the medication are recorded on the eCRF.  Concomitant medication will be coded using an 
internationally recognized and accepted coding dictionary.  
Drug -drug interaction studies in NHP, could not exclude the potential for ALN -AS1 to alter the 
clearance of drugs metabolized by the CYP3A enzymes.  T herefore, patients on medications 
metabolized by CYP3A, especially those with narrow therapeutic ranges, may require 
monitoring for their drug levels or drug response.  ALN -AS1 could potentially increase the 
clearance of drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isof orm.   Investigators will review all 
medications at study start and monitor response to these medications during the study.  For 
patients who require new medications while on study, selection of medications that are not 
mainly metabolized by the CYP3A isof orm is recommended.  A list of medications that are 
sensitive CYP3A substrates is included in Table 6 Appendix Section  11.3.  In addition, a more 
detailed and current list of sensitive CYP3A -metabolized medications and CYP3A -metabolized 
medications with a narrow therapeutic range is available at th e Indiana University, Division of 
Clinical Pharmacology, website (http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/clinical -table/). [31] 
Patients are not permitted to be on hemin prophylaxis at Screening; however, patients are 
permitted to receive concomitant hemin treatment for the management of acute porphyria 
attacks.  Patients experiencing significant breakthrough attacks while enrolled  in this study, 
necessitating frequent hemin treatment, may receive hemin prophylaxis if in the Investigator’s 
judgment this is clinically beneficial to the patient.  The Investigator should contact with the 
Sponsor and Medical Monitor before prophylactic hemin treatment.  The dose, regimen, and 
dates of administration will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF.   
Pain medication (eg, opiates, opioids, narcotic analgesics) and glucose administration are 
permitted for the management of porphyria and for acute po rphyria attacks.  
If patients use nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory medications intermittently or chronically, they 
must have been able to tolerate them with no previous side effects (eg, gastric distress or 
bleeding).   
Standard vitamins and topical medicatio ns are permitted; however, topical steroids must not be 
applied anywhere near the injection site(s) unless medically indicated.

 37 6.4. Contraceptive Requirements  
No data are available on the use of ALN -AS1 in pregnancy; however, there is no suspicion of 
human ter atogenicity based on class effects or genotoxic potential.  ALN -AS1 was neither 
genotoxic nor clastogenic in in vitro and in vivo studies.   
WOCBP must be willing to use acceptable methods of contraception 14 days before first dose, 
throughout study partic ipation, and for 90 days after last dose administration.   
Birth control methods which may be considered as acceptable include:  
 Established use of oral, implantable, injectable, transdermal hormonal, or intrauterine 
hormone -releasing system as methods of c ontraception .  WOCBP using hormonal 
methods of contraception must also use a barrier method (condom or occlusive cap 
[diaphragm or cervical/vault cap] in conjunction with spermicide [eg, foam, gel, film, 
cream, or suppository]).  
 If hormonal methods of cont raception are medically contraindicated for WOCBP due 
to underlying disease, a double -barrier method (combination of male condom with 
either cap, diaphragm, or sponge, in conjunction with spermicide) is also considered 
an acceptable method of contraception . 
 Placement of an intrauterine device  
 Bilateral tubal occlusion  
 Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post -vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the 
study, the vasectomized male par tner should be the sole partner for that patient)  
 Sexual abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
patient, is considered an acceptable method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entir e period of risk associated with the study 
drug (defined above).  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not considered sexual abstinence and do 
not meet criteria for an acceptable method of birth control.  As determined by the 
investigator, the reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to 
the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Abstinent patients must agree to use 1 of  the abovementioned contraceptive methods 
if they start a heterosexual relationship during the study and continue to do so for the 
entire period of risk associated with the study drug (defined above).  
 WOCBP includes any female patient who has experienced m enarche and who is not 
postmenopausal or permanently sterilized (eg, bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, 
or bilateral salpingectomy).  Postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 
months without an alternative medical cause, confirmed by follic le stimulating 
hormone level within the postmenopausal range.  
6.5. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with study drug administration will be verified through observation by study 
personnel or trained home healthcare professionals.

 38 7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
The schedule o f study assessments is provided in Table 1.  
7.1. Screening/Baseline Assessments  
Informed consent, patient demographic data, and eligibility criteria will be  confirmed at 
Screening/Baseline.  An interval medical history/disease history will be obtained at 
Screening/Baseline.  The last assessments performed, determining previous study 
(ALN -AS1-001) completion, will serve as the Screening/Baseline assessments in  this study.  If 
more than 60 days have elapsed since the last assessment, clinical laboratory tests and ECGs will 
be repeated before administration of ALN -AS1. 
7.2. Clinical Activity Assessments  
The clinical activity of ALN -AS1 will be assessed by the frequency and characteristics of 
porphyria attacks including, but not limited to, duration, treatment, and severity of porphyria 
attacks and number and duration of visits to a health care setting for acute porphyria care (eg, 
hospital, emergency department , infusion center, or outpatient clinic).  Concomitant hemin 
administration will also be recorded.  
7.2.1.  Patient Diary

 39 7.5. Safety Assessments  
The assessment of safety during the course of the study will consist of the surveillance and 
recording of AEs including SAEs, recording of concomitant medications and measurements of 
vital signs, physical examination, and ECG findings an d clinical laboratory evaluations.  
Safety will be monitored over the course of the study by an SRC as described in Section  4.6. 
7.5.1.  Vital Signs  
Vital si gn measurements include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory 
rate.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be consistent for each 
patient), after the patient has rested comfortably for at least 10 min utes.  Blood pressure should 
be taken using the same arm throughout the study.  Body temperature will be obtained in degrees 
Celsius, heart rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in beats per minute, and 
respiration rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in breaths per minute.  
For the safety of the patient, additional vital sign assessments may be added at the discretion of 
the Investigator.  
7.5.2.  Weight and Height  
Height will be measured in centimeters at the Screening/Baseline visit on ly.  Body weight will be 
measured in kilograms.  Body mass index will be calculated in the database.  
Body  weight measured on the dosing day will be used to calculate the dose of ALN -AS1 through 
M12.  After M12, weight measured at either the previous study center visit or current study 
center visit may be used for dosing calculations . 
7.5.3.  Physical Examination  
Complete physical examinations will include the examination of the following:  general 
appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, chest/respiratory, he art/cardiovascular, 
gastrointestinal/liver, musculoskeletal/extremities, dermatological/skin, thyroid/neck, lymph 
nodes, and neurological/psychiatric.  
Targeted physical examinations will include the examination of the following:  general 
appearance, chest/respiratory, heart/cardiovascular, gastrointestinal/liver, and 
neurological/psychiatric.  
7.5.4.  Electrocardiogram  
Triplicate standard 12 -lead ECGs will be performed using central ECG equipment, with readings 
approximately 1 minute apart and recorded as spec ified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 
1).  Patients shoul d be seated or supine for at least 5 minutes before each ECG is obtained.  The 
electroph ysiological parameters assessed will be rhythm, ventricular rate, PR interval, QRS 
duration, QT interval, ST and T waves, Bazett -corrected QT interval (QTcB), and Fridericia 
corrected QT interval (QTcF).  
When ECG and blood sample collection occur at the sa me time, ECGs should be performed 
before blood samples are drawn.

 40 Using central ECG equipment, triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine 
position after the patient has rested comfortably for at least 5  minutes.   
In all patients rec eiving ≤2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1, it is required that ECGs will be obtained on at 
least 2 separate clinic visits (D1, and Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or 18) , each of which will include 
same day predose and 2 -hour (±15  minutes) postdose readings, paired with PK timepo ints ( Table  
3) as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  1).   
Similarly, in all patients receiving >2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1, it is required that ECGs will be 
obtained on at least 2 separate clinic visits (D1, and Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or 18) , each of which 
will include same day predose and 4 -hour (±20  minutes) postdose readings, paired with PK 
timepoints ( Table  3), as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  1).  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for reviewing the  ECGs to assess whether the results 
have changed since the Screening/ Baseline visit and to determine the clinical relevance  of the 
results.  These assessments will be recorded on the eCRF.  For any clinically relevant ECG 
changes from the Screening/Baseline visit (eg, ischemic ECG changes, wave/interval changes, or 
arrhythmia), the Investigator must contact the Medica l Monitor to discuss continued participation 
of the patient in the study . 
7.5.5.  Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory.   
On dosing days up to the Month 18 visit, results from hematology,  chemistry, and coagulation 
tests collected within the prior 14 days must be reviewed by the Investigator before study drug 
administration.  These results can be analyzed centrally or at a local laboratory.  If results from 
within the prior 14 days are not  available at a dosing visit (at visits from D1 to Month 18), 
locally analyzed assessments must be reviewed to allow same day study drug administration  and 
additional samples for central analysis must  also be collected.   On dosing days from Month  19 
throug h Month 36, a review of laboratory results within 14 days is not required.   
In the event of an unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study 
drug administration, the test should be repeated and followed up at the discretio n of the 
Investigator until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis is made to 
adequately explain the abnormality.  
At any point during the study, and based on Investigator judgment, if a patient experiences 
uncharacteristic si gns and symptoms during a porphyria attack, lipase testing should be 
performed and imaging evaluations (eg, right upper quadrant ultrasound and/or other testing, 
based on Investigator judgment) should be considered by the Investigator.  Signs and symptoms 
include, but are not limited to, uncharacteristic abdominal pain and worsening nausea and 
vomiting.  
Imaging is required for any serum lipase result of ≥3× the upper limit of normal, or as clinically 
indicated.

Blood samples will be collected to evaluate antidrug antibodies.  On days when ALN -AS1 is 
administered, blood samples for antidrug antibody testing must be collected before ALN -AS1 is  
administered.  
Sample collection for patients who experience a potential anaphylactic reaction is discussed in 
Section  6.2.3.2.1 . 
Details regarding the processing, shipping, and analysis of the samples will be provided in the 
Laboratory Manual.  
7.5.5.2.  Pregnancy Testing  
A pregnancy test will be performed for WOCBP only.  A serum pregnancy test will be 
performed at Screening/Baseline and urine pregnancy tests will be performed thereafter per the 
Schedule of Assessments and any time pregnancy is suspected.  Urine pregnancy tests may also 
be performed more frequently ( eg, monthly) based on local country requirements.  The results of 
the pregnancy test must be known before study drug administration.  Patients who are pregnant 
are not eligible for study participation.  Any woman with a positive pregnancy test during the 
study will be discontinued from study drug, but will continue to be followed for safety.  Patients 
determined to be pregnant while on study will be followed until the pregnancy outcome is known 
(see Section  7.5.6.6  for follow -up instructions).  
7.5.6.  Adverse Events  
7.5.6.1.  Definitions  
Adverse Event  
According to the ICH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 21 
Code of Federal Regulations  312.32, Investigational New Drug Safety Reporting, an AE is any 
untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational subject administered a 
medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening (An event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred.  It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death)  
 Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Is an important me dical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above (eg, 
278
ALN -AS1 (givosiran)    Clinical Study Protoc ol ALN -AS1-002 
Amendment 5   03 May  2018 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  
 43 events include allergic bron chospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug 
dependency or abuse).  
Adverse Event Severity  
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below:  
Mild:  Mild events are those which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal 
daily activity.  
Moderate:  Moderate events are those which cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with 
normal daily activities.  
Severe:  Severe events are those which incapaci tate and prevent usual activity.  
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity.  AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of the start and stop of e ach incidence.  When changes in the severity of an AE 
occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day should 
be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be 
recorded se parately (with distinct onset dates)  
AE severity and seriousness are assessed independently.  ‘Severity’ characterizes the intensity of 
an AE.  ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining 
regulatory reporting obli gations (see definition for Serious Adverse Event).  
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Treatment  
The relationship of each AE to study treatment should be evaluated by the Investigator using the 
following criteria:  
Definitely related:  A clinical ev ent, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to the medication administration, and which 
cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
The response to withdrawal of the drug should be clin ically plausible.  
Possibly related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to the medication administration, but which 
could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals.  Information on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or 
unclear.  
Unlikely related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no 
temporal relationship to medication administration, and which other 
drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations.  
Not related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality that has no 
temporal relationship to the medication or has more likely alternative 
etiology.  
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest  
The following ev ents are considered to be adverse events of clinical interest:  
279

 44  ISRs  
 Hepatic AEs, including LFT abnormalities considered clinically significant by the 
Investigator . 
 Lipase >3×ULN (or >3× the baseline lipase measurement if baseline is >ULN)  
 Anaphylactic Reactions. Anaphylactic reaction is a severe, potentially fatal, systemic 
allergic reaction with acute onset (minutes to hours).  Symptoms of an anaphylactic 
reaction  may include  skin or mucosal tissue (e.g. generalized hives, pruritus, 
angioedema), respir atory compromise (e.g. wheezing, bronchospasm, hypoxia), 
reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (e.g. syncope, hypotonia) .  See 
Section  11.4 (Table  7) for guidance on diagnosing anaphylactic reactions. [35] 
7.5.6.2.  Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
The patient should be a sked about medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last 
visit.  The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospitalized, had any accidents, used 
any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC).  
In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant 
laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are 
relevant to patient safety.  
Recording Adverse Events  
The Investigato r is responsible for recording non -serious AEs that are observed or reported by 
the patient after administration of the first dose of study drug regardless of their relationship to 
study drug through the end of study.  Non -serious AEs will be followed unti l the end of study.  
The Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by the patient 
after the time when the informed consent is signed regardless of their relationship to study drug 
through the end of study.  SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until baseline level 
is reached, or until the SAE is considered by the Investigator to be chronic or the patient is 
stable, as appropriate.  
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center  and in the eCRF for 
the patient, whether or not they are considered to be drug -related.  Each AE must be described in 
detail:  onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to investigational drug, 
action taken, and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable).  
For SAEs, record the event(s) on the eCRF.  If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is 
unavailable, complete the backup SAE form.  
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest, the Sponsor or its desi gnee should be 
notified within 24 hours using a supplemental AEs of clinical interest (AECI) eCRF.  Additional 
clinical and laboratory information may be collected based upon the severity or nature of the 
event.  
If a patient has ISRs meeting any of the fol lowing criteria, the Investigator or delegate should 
contact the Medical Monitor and submit a supplemental ISR eCRF:  
280
ALN -AS1 (givosiran)    Clinical Study Protoc ol ALN -AS1-002 
Amendment 5   03 May  2018

 45  ISRs that are recurrent and/or demonstrate a pattern of increasing severity  
 Any ISR that is determined to be severe and/or a cause for stud y drug discontinuation  
 Any ISR which, in the opinion of the Investigator, requires further medical evaluation or 
treatment  
In some cases, where it is medically appropriate, further evaluation may include photographs, 
referral to a dermatologist, skin biopsy, or other laboratory testing.  If a biopsy was obtained, the 
Sponsor may request that the biopsy also be reviewed by a central dermatopathologist.  To better 
understand the safety profile of the study drug, additional analysis of biopsy tissue may b e 
performed according to local regulations.  
For patients with hepatic AEs, additional information, including, clinical history, course of event, 
and local laboratory results to monitor LFT levels or other laboratory parameters, may be 
collected.  
7.5.6.3.  Serious Ad verse Events Require Immediate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee  
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by the Investigator.  Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section  7.5.6.1  must be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee within 24 hours from the time that clinical study center personnel first 
learns of the event.  All SAEs must be reported regardless of the relationship to study drug.  
The initial report should include at least the following information:  
 Patient’s study number  
 Description and date of onset of the event  
 Criterion for serious  
 Preliminary assignment of relationship to study drug  
 Investigator/clin ical study center information  
To report the SAE, complete the eCRF.  If the EDC system is unavailable, complete the backup 
SAE form.  Within 24 hours of receipt of follow -up information, the Investigator must update the 
report.  SAEs must be reported using  the contact information provided in the Study Manual.  
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken by the Investigator using his/her best medical 
judgment to treat the SAE.  These measures and the patient’s response to these measures should 
be recorded.  All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be followed by the 
Investigator until satisfactory resolution or the Investigator deems the SAE to be chronic or 
stable.  Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed by the Inve stigator as 
needed to adequately determine the etiology of the event.  
7.5.6.4.  Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities  
The Sponsor or its representative is required to report certain study events in an expedited 
manner to the Food and Drug Administration , the European Medicines Agency’s EudraVigilance 
electronic system according to Directive 2001/20/EC, and to all country Regulatory Authorities 
where the study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations.

 46 The following describes the safet y reporting timeline requirements for suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) and other reportable events:  
Immediately and within 7 calendar days  
 Any suspected adverse reaction that is associated with the use of the study drug, 
unexpected, and fatal or life threatening.  Follow -up information must be reported in 
the following 8 days.  
Immediately and within 15 calendar days  
 Any suspected adverse reaction that is associated with the use of the study drug, 
unexpected, and serious, but not fatal  or life threatening, and there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the reaction.  
 Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggest a significant risk for human 
patients including reports of mutagenicity, teratog enicity, or carcinogenicity.  
 Any event in connection with the conduct of the study or the development of the 
study drug that may affect the safety of the trial patients.  
In addition, periodic safety reporting to regulatory authorities will be performed by the Sponsor 
or its representative according to national and local regulations.  
7.5.6.5.  Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
SUSARs will be reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Eth ics 
Committee (IEC) per their institutional policy by the Investigator or Sponsor (or Sponsor 
designee) according to country requirements.  Copies of each report and documentation of 
IRB/IEC notification and acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the I nvestigator’s study 
file. 
7.5.6.6.  Pregnancy Reporting  
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the course of this study through 90 days following 
the last dose of study drug, the Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee 
within 24 hours of being notified of the pregnancy.  Details of the pregnancy will be recorded on 
the pregnancy reporting form.  The patient should receive any necessary counseling regarding 
the risks of continuing the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  
The pregnancy should be followed by the Investigator until completion.  At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy.  If the outcome of the 
pregnancy results in a postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion , stillbirth, neonatal death, 
or congenital anomaly, then the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE 
as outlined in Section  7.5.6.3 .   
7.5.6.7.  Overdose Reporting  
An overdose is defined as any dose administered to or taken by a patient (accidentally or 
intentionally) that exceeds the highest daily dose, or is at a higher frequency, than included in the

 47 protocol.  It is up to the investigator to decide whether a dose is to be considered an overdose, in 
consultation with the Sponsor.  Overdose must be recorded in the eCRF.  
All reports of overdose (with or without an AE) must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor 
or designee.   
7.6. Exploratory Assessments  
Blood and urine samples will be collected for exploratory analyses.  Aliquots of samples will be 
obtained and frozen, to permit future analysis of the effect of ALN -AS1 on exploratory 
biomarkers.   
Where local regulations allow, bio logic samples will be retained on behalf of the Sponsor for a 
maximum of 15 years following the last patient’s last visit in the study.  Details regarding the 
collection, processing, storage, and shipping of samples will be in the Laboratory Manual.  
7.7. Other Assessments  
7.7.1.  EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire  
QOL will be assessed through the use of the 5 -level EQ -5D (EQ -5D-5L), a standardized 
questionnaire measuring health outcomes. [34]  In addition to the time points indicated, the 
EQ-5D-5L questionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a 
porphyri a attack (but, not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible.

 50 9.1.1.  Informed Consent  
The Investigator will ensure that the patient is given full and adequ ate oral and written 
information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study.  Patients must also 
be notified that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time.  The patient should be given 
the opportunity to ask questions and  allowed time to consider the information provided.  
The patient’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study 
procedures.  
The Investigator must maintain the original, signed ICF.  A copy of the signed ICF must be 
given to  the patient.  
9.1.2.  Ethical Review  
The final study protocol, including the final version of the ICF, must be approved or given a 
favorable opinion in writing by an IRB or IEC, as appropriate.  The Investigator must submit 
written approval before he or she can en roll any patient into the study.  
The Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB or IEC of any amendment to the protocol 
in accordance with local requirements.  In addition, the IRB or IEC must approve all advertising 
used to recruit patients for the  study.  The protocol must be reapproved by the IRB or IEC upon 
receipt of amendments and annually, as local regulations require.  
Initial IRB approval of the protocol, and all materials approved by the IRB for this study 
including the patient consent form and recruitment materials must be maintained by the 
Investigator and made available for inspection.  
The Investigator will submit reports of SAEs as outlined in Section  7.5.6 .  In addition, the 
Investigator agrees to submit progress reports to the IRB or IEC per their local reporting 
requirements, or at least annually and at the conclusion of the study.  The repor ts will be made 
available to the Sponsor or designee.  
Any communications from regulatory agencies in regard to inspections, other studies that impact 
this protocol or the qualifications of study personnel should be promptly reported to the Sponsor 
or its d esignee.  
The Investigator is also responsible for providing the IRB with reports of any reportable serious 
adverse drug reactions from any other study conducted with the investigational drug.  The 
Sponsor or designee will provide this information to the Investigator.  
Major changes in this research activity, except those to remove an apparent immediate hazard to 
the patient, must be reviewed and approved by the Sponsor and the IRB or IEC that approved the 
study.  Amendments to the protocol must be submitte d in writing to the Investigator’s IRB or 
IEC and the Regulatory Authority for approval before patients are enrolled under the amended 
protocol.  
9.1.3.  Study Documentation, Confidentiality, and Records Retention  
All documentation relating to the study should be r etained for the period of time required by 
applicable local law.  If it becomes necessary for the Sponsor, the Sponsor’s designee, applicable 
IRB/IEC, or applicable regulatory authorities to review or audit any documentation relating to 
286

 51 the study, the Inve stigator must permit direct access to all source documents/data.  Records will 
not be destroyed without informing the Sponsor in writing and giving the Sponsor the 
opportunity to store the records for a longer period of time at the Sponsor’s expense.   
The Investigator must ensure that the patients’ confidentiality  will be maintained.  On the CRFs 
or other documents submitted to the Sponsor or designees, patients should not be identified by 
their names, but by the assigned patient number and initials.  If p atient names are included on 
copies of documents submitted to the Sponsor or designees, the names (except for initials) will 
be obliterated and the assigned patient number added to the document.  Documents not for 
submission to the Sponsor (eg, signed ICFs ) should be maintained by the Investigator in strict 
confidence.  
The Investigator must treat all of the information related to the study and the compiled data as 
confidential, whose use is for the purpose of conducting the study.  The Sponsor must approve 
any transfer of information not directly involved in the study.  
In compliance with local and/or regional regulations, this clinical study may be registered and 
study results may be posted on public registries, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.  
9.1.4.  End of the Study  
The end of the study is defined as last patient last visit.  
9.1.5.  Discontinuation of the Clinical Study  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study for clinical or administrative reasons at 
any time.  If the clinical study center does not recruit at a  reasonable rate, the study may be 
discontinued at that clinical study center.  Should the study be terminated and/or the clinical 
study center closed for whatever reason, all documentation and study drug pertaining to the study 
must be returned to the Spo nsor or its representative, and the Investigators, IEC/IRB and 
Regulatory Authorities will be promptly informed of the termination and the reason for the 
decision.  The Investigator should promptly inform the patients and assure appropriate therapy 
and fol low-up.  Patients should then be withdrawn from the study.   
9.2. Data Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
9.2.1.  Data Handling  
Study data must be recorded on case report forms (paper and/or electronic) provided by the 
Sponsor or designee on behalf of the Sponsor.  Case report forms must be completed only by 
persons designated by the Investigator.  If eCRFs are used, study data must be entered by trained 
clinical study center personnel with access to a valid and secure eCRF system.  All data entered 
into the eCRF mus t also be available in the source documents.  Corrections on paper CRFs must 
be made so as to not obliterate the original data and must be initialed and dated by the person 
who made the correction.  
9.2.2.  Study Monitoring  
The clinical monitor, as a representative  of the Sponsor, has an obligation to closely follow the 
study conduct at the clinical study center.  The monitor will visit the Investigator and clinical 
287

 52 study center periodically and will maintain frequent telephone and written contact.  The monitor 
will maintain current personal knowledge of the study through observation, review of study 
records and source documentation, and discussion of the conduct of the study with the 
Investigator and personnel.  
The monitor will review source documents, systems and C RFs to ensure overall quality and 
completeness of the data and to confirm study procedures are complied with the requirements in 
the study protocol.  The Sponsor, or its designee, will be allowed to conduct clinical study center 
visits to the investigation  facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study.  The 
Investigator agrees to allow the monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug 
accountability records, patient charts and study source documents, and other records relative to 
study conduct.  
9.2.3.  Audits and Inspections  
Periodically, the Sponsor or its authorized representatives audit clinical investigative study 
centers as an independent review of core trial processes and documents to determine whether 
these activities we re conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported 
according to the protocol, GCP guidelines of the ICH, and any applicable regulatory 
requirements.  A regulatory authority, an IEC or an IRB may visit the clinical study center to 
perfo rm audits or inspections, including source data verification.  The Investigator should contact 
the Sponsor, or its designee, immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency about an 
inspection.  
9.3. Publication Policy  
It is intended that after completion of the study, the data are to be submitted for publication in a 
scientific journal and/or for reporting at a scientific meeting.  A copy of any proposed manuscript 
must be provided and confirmed received at the Sponsor at least 30 days before its submission, 
and according to any additional publication details in the Investigator Agreement.

 When scheduled at the same time points, assessments of vital signs and 12 -lead ECGs should be performed first, before the physical 
examinations and blood/urine sample collections.  
a Patients are not required to complete Screening/Baseline assessments if the assessments in the previous study (ALN -AS1-001) were completed within 60 days 
of administration of the first dose of ALN -AS1 in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed since the last assessment, clinical laboratory tests and ECGs 
will be repeated before administration of ALN -AS1.  Results should be available and deemed acceptable before the administration of the first dos e of ALN -
AS1. 
b After a patient has completed 6 months of ALN -AS1 administration in this study, and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, 
study procedures, including ALN -AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s  home by a healthcare professional.  Study procedures may occur at the 
patient’s home at the discretion of the Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to com plete at least 1 visit at the clinical 
study center Q3M thro ugh M12, and thereafter Q6M. Additional visits to collect clinical laboratory samples may occur at home at any point during t he 
treatment period, within 14 days prior to scheduled dose administration.  
c See Section  7.1 for details on the interval medical history/disease history to be recorded at Screening/Baseline.  Ongoing AEs from the previ ous study 
(ALN -AS1-001) will be captured as medical history.  
d A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening/Baseline, and D1.  At all other visits, a targeted physical ex amination will be performed.  On 
dosing days, the physical examination will be performed predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not a dministered, the physical examination can occur at any time 
during the visit.  See Section  7.5.3  for details on the physical examination.  
e Height w ill be measured at Screening/Baseline only.  
f Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate.  On D1, vital signs will be collected  within 1 hour predose; and 2 hours 
(±10 minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days , vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, vital signs 
can be collected at any time during the visit.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be cons istent for each patie nt), after the 
patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  
g Using central ECG equipment, triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine position after the patient has rested comfortably for at least 5 
minutes.  For patients receiving  ≤2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1 ECGs will be performed within 1 hour predose and 2 hours (±15 minutes) postdose at a minimum of 2

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential       60 Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 15 (only if visit is done at clinic), or Month 18.  On all other dosing d ays, ECGs will be collected within 1 hour predose 
(see Section  7.5.4   for ECG assessment details).  
h Clinical laboratory parameters are described in  Section  7.5.5 .  On dosing days, blood samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected predose.  On 
days when ALN -AS1 is not administe red, blood samples can be collected at any time during the visit. On dosing days up to the Month 18 visit,results from 
hematology, chemistry (including LFTs), and coagulation tests collected within the prior 14 days must be reviewed by the Inve stigator bef ore study drug 
administration.  If results from within the prior 14 days are not available at a dosing visit (at visits from D1 to Month 18) , locally analyzed predose assessments 
may be used for review in order to allow same day study drug administration, and additional samples for central analysis must also be collected.  
i A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening/Baseline; thereafter, urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  Results  must be available before dosing.  
j ALN -AS1 will be administered by SC injection according to the Pharmacy Manual.  See Section  6.2.2  for ALN -AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  For weight -
based dosing, weight measured at the current study center visit ( dosing day ) will be used to calculate the dose of ALN -AS1.  After M12, weight  measured at 
either the previous study center visit or on current study center visit  will be used to calculate the weight -based dose of ALN -AS1. 
k Spot urine samples will be collected for measurement of ALA, PBG, and creatinine levels.  On dosing days, sam ples should be collected predose.  
l On dosing days, blood and urine samples for ALAS1 mRNA (and possible biomarker) analysis will be collected within 1 hour pred ose. 
m Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points listed in  Table 3 (Appendix Section  11.1).  Blood sample collectio n for PK analysis at 
Month 9 and Month 15 is only necessary if ECG will be performed at same visit.  
n On dosing days, blood samples for antidrug antibody analysis should be collected within 1 hour predose.  
o Porphyria attack laboratory sample collection ki ts should be dispensed at the screening visit along with instructions for use. For an y attack that occurs through 
M37 , urine samples should be collected within 24 hours of the start of clinical intervention (eg, hemin or glucose administratio n) and within 24 hours of the end 
of clinical intervention.  If patients are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laborator y sample collection kits should be used 
for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center, if possible.  These urine samples may also be analyzed for exploratory biomarkers.  
p In addition to the time points indicated, the EQ -5D-5L questionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a porphyria attack 
(but not more  than once in a 6 month period), if possible.  
q Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain assessments, and narcotic use on  a daily basis through M9; 
thereafter, acute porphyria attacks will be recorded in  the diary.  The BPI will be completed on a weekly basis as part of the patient diary through M9, then 
Q3M.  
r Medications that are ongoing from the previous study (ALN -AS1-001), started between the previous study and this study, and started after signing i nformed 
consent in this study, will be captured as concomitant medication(s).

Summary of Changes ( dated 03 May  2018 )  
compared to Protocol Amendment 4 (dated 02 August  2017)  
A Multicenter, Open -label Extension Study to Evaluate the Long -term Safety and Clinical 
Activity of Subcutaneously Administered ALN AS1 in Patients with Acute Intermittent 
Porphyria who have Completed a Previous Clinical Study with ALN -AS1 
 
Rationale for Protocol Amendment   
The purpose of the amendment is to:  
 Include clinical data on a single case of anaphylactic reaction, information regarding the 
potential risk for anaphylactic reactions, and provide updated guidance for dosing and 
monitoring.  The event of anaphylactic reaction was previously reported to ap plicable 
regulatory authorities and Institutional Review Boards/Ethics Committees.  
 Benefit -Risk Assessment (Section  1.7) modified to align with potential risks in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  Information on reproductive health moved to Contraceptive 
Requi rements (Section  6.4) and CYP inhibition moved to Concomitant Medications 
(Section 6  3). 
 Update guidance and procedures on patient withdrawal from study.  
 Schedule of Assess ments footnotes were updated to:  
o Update end of stu dy visit, early termination visit , and safety follow -up visit timing 
and assessments.  
o Clarify clinical laboratory testing required prior to dosing  
o Clarify timing of ECG assessments for patients administered ≤ 2.5  mg/kg and 
>2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1 
 provide the following clarifications:  
o patient withdrawal  details regarding subsequent visits and data collection  
o definition of sexual abstinence  
o contraception with an intrauterine hormone -releasing system also requires use of a 
barrier method

The primary section(s) of the protocol affected by the changes in the protocol amendment are indicated.  The corresponding te xt has 
been revised throughout the protocol.  Deleted text is indicated by strikeout ; added text is indicated by bold  font. 
 
Purpos e: Provide details of an anaphylactic reaction reported in Study ALN -AS1-002 and add anaphylactic reaction to potential risk  
The primary change occurs in Section 1.7 Benefit -Risk Assessment  
Added text:  Anaphylactic reactions:  There is a potential risk of developing a severe allergic reaction with givosiran 
administration.  In the present study, one patient in the 2.5 mg/kg monthly dose group with a history of asthma 
and multiple allergies experienced an SAE of anaphyla ctic reaction  that was determined b y the Investigator to be 
definitely related to study drug given the temporal relationship of ALN -AS1 treatment to the onset of the reaction 
(within minutes).  The patient was treated and recovered and was discontinued from the study.Guidance on dose 
admini stration and monitoring for anaphylactic reactions has been included in this protocol.  
Section(s) also containing similar or related changes

ALN -AS1 (givosiran)  Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
 Amendment 5 Summary of Changes_03 May 2018  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  3 Purpose: Clarified that only important potential risks are listed in Section 1.7.  To align with the Investigator’s Brochure , removed 
discussion of Reproductive Health and CYP Inhibition from important risks and , instead  included details in respective sections in the 
protocol  (reproductive health information moved to Section 6.4, Contraception Requirements and CYP inhibition information moved 
to Section 6.3, Concomitant Medication .   
The primary change occurs in Section 1.7 Benefit -Risk Assessment  
Now reads:  The important  potential risks associated with administration of ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP are as follows:  
Removed text :  Reproductive health:  No data are available on the use of ALN -AS1 in pregnancy; however, there is 
no suspicion of human teratogenicity based on class effects or genotoxic potential.  ALN -AS1 was 
neither genotoxic nor clastogenic in in vitro and in vivo stu dies.  Women of child bearing potential 
(WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test, cannot be breastfeeding, and must be willing to use 
acceptable methods of contraception during studies with ALN -AS1.  
 CYP inhibition:  A study in NHP demonstrated that ALN -AS1 dosing could potentially increase the 
clearance of drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isoform.  As contraceptive hormones are metabolized 
via CYP3A, WOCBP must use a barrier method of contraception, in addition to hormonal 
contraception, during study part icipation.  Additionally, Investigators will review all patient 
medications at study start and monitor responses to these medications during the study.  A list of 
medications that are sensitive CYP3A substrates is in Table 7  in Appendix Section  11.3.In add ition, 
a list of medications that are sensitive CYP3A substrates is available at the Indiana University, 
Division of Clinical Pharmacology, website. [31]

ALN -AS1 (givosiran)  Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
 Amendment 5 Summary of Changes_03 May 2018  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  5 Purpose:  Updated to reflect complete instructions to align with current Company language    
The primary change occurs in Section 5.3.1 – Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Now reads:  The Investigator or designee may discontinue dosing in a patient if the patient:  
 Is in violation of the protocol  
 Experiences a SAE considered to be possibly or definitely related to the study drug or an intolerable 
AE  
 Becomes pregnant  
 Is found to be considerably noncompliant with the protocol -requirements  
Patients who are pregnant will be discontinued from study drug dosing immediately (see Section 7.5.6.6  for 
reporting and follow -up of pregnancy).  Patients who discontinue treatment will be asked to complete the 
Month 39 visit assessments.   A positive urine pregnancy test s hould be confirmed by a serum pregnancy 
test prior to discontinuing the study drug.  
If a patient discontinues dosing due to a serious adverse event (SAE), the SAE should be followed as 
described in Section  7.5.6.   When a patient discontinues study drug dosing, the primary reason must be 
recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  Patients who discontinue study drug and remain on 
study may receive treatment consistent with local standard practice for their disease per Investigator 
judgement, as applicable.  
Patients who discontinue treatment will be asked to complete an early termination (ET) visit  at which all 
Month 37 visit  procedures  will be performed; they must also  return for a safety -follow -up visit at 3 months 
(84 [+7] days) after their last dose of ALN -AS1.

ALN -AS1 (givosiran)  Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
 Amendment 5 Summary of Changes_03 May 2018  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  6 Purpose:  Current section was replaced with more detailed information regarding premature discontinuation study drug and to a lign 
protocol text with sample Informed Consent Form.  
The primary change occurs in Section 5.3.2 – Discontinuation from the Study  
Now reads:  A patient or their legal guardian may decide to stop  the patient’s  participation in the study at any time.  
Patients considering to stop the study should be informed that t hey can discontinue treatment and 
complete study assessments including follow -up, as per the SOA, or alternatively may complete any 
minimal assessments for which the patient consents. The Investigator may withdraw a patient at any 
time if this is considere d to be in the patient’s best interest.  
However, study integrity and interpretation is best maintained if all randomized patients continue study 
assessments and follow -up.  Stopping study participation could mean:  
 If a patient discontinues from the study, he/she will be asked to complete an early 
termination (ET) visit at which all Month 37 visit procedures  will be performed; the 
patient must also  return for a safety -follow -up visit 3 months (84 [+7] days) after his/her  
last dose of ALN -AS1. 
 A patient can s top taking the study drug and stop study -related visits, but allow the 
investigator and study team to review the patient’s medical records, public records or be 
contacted in order to receive information about the patient’s health  
When a patient withdraws from stops  the study, the discontinuation and  reason for study 
withdrawal discontinuation  must be recorded  in the appropriate section of the electronic case report form 
(eCRF)  and all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly  as possible.  If a 
patient withdraws stops the study  due to an adverse event (AE), including an  SAE, the SAE AE should be 
followed as described in Section  7.5.6 . 
If the patient wants to stop participation in the study, he/she should notify the study doctor in writing or 
in any other form that may be locally required. The personal data already collected during the study, 
including patient’s biological samples, will still be used together with the data collected on other patients 
in the study according to the informed consent and applicable laws.  
In addition to stopping participation in the study, the patient could decide to withdraw his/her consent as 
explained in Section  5.3.3.

ALN -AS1 (givosiran)  Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
 Amendment 5 Summary of Changes_03 May 2018  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  7 Purpose: New section added to discuss withdrawal of consent     
The primary change occurs in Section 5.3.3 (new section) – Withdrawal  of Consent to Collect and Process the Patient’s Personal Data  
New text:  The patient may decide to withdraw his/her consent informing the study doctor at any time in writing, or in any 
other form that may be locally required.  This  means that the patient wants to stop participation in the study and 
any further collection of his/her personal data.  
 The sponsor will continue to keep and use a patient's study information (including any data  
resulting from the analysis of the patient's biological samples until time of withdrawal) according 
to applicable law.  This is done to guarantee the validity of the study, determine the effects of the 
study treatment, and ensure completeness of study doc umentation.  
 The patient can also request that collected samples be destroyed or returned (to the extent it is 
permitted by applicable law) at any time.  
 Patients who withdraw their consent to collect and use Personal Data should understand that 
public recor ds may be reviewed to determine the patient’s survival status as allowed per local 
and national regulations.    
In US and Japan, otherwise, samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal may still be used for further 
testing/analysis in accordance with  the terms of the protocol and of the informed consent form.  
In EU and rest of world, in any event, samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal will not be used any 
longer, unless permitted by applicable law. They will be stored or destroyed accordi ng to applicable legal

Study Design  
This is a multicente r, open -label extension study to evaluate the long -term safety and clinical activity 
of ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP who completed study ALN -AS1-001. 
The last assessments performed, determining previous study (ALN -AS1-001) completion, will serve as 
the Scr eening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed since the last 
assessment, safety assessments will be repeated before administration of ALN -AS1.  It is anticipated 
that patients will begin ALN -AS1 administration in this study within 6 months after the last dose of 
study drug in the previous study.  Eligibility will be confirmed before administration of the first dose of 
ALN -AS1 (Day 1).  Patients will undergo assessments at the clinical study center every month for the 
first 3 months.   Then, through Month 6, and according to the dosing regimen selected, assessments will 
take place at the clinical study center or via a phone contact (for an every month dosing regimen, visits 
will be every month; for an every 3 months dosing regim en, visits will be every 3 months).  A fter a 
patient has completed 12 months of ALN -AS1 administration in this study (6 months in an every 
month dosing regimen), and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, 
study procedures,  including ALN -AS1 administration , may take place at the patient’s home by a 
healthcare professional.  Study procedures  may occur at the patient’s home at the discretion of the 
Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit 
at the clinical study center every 3 months for the first year, and thereafter every 6 months through the 
end of the treatment per iod.  Additional visits to collect c linical laboratory samples may occur at home 
at any point during the treatment period, within 14 days prior to scheduled dose administration.  
Patients will return to the clinical study center for a posttreatment follow -up visit after administration 
of the last dose of ALN -AS1.  An ALA/PBG Monitoring/EOS visit will be conducted either at the 
clinical study center or via phone contact, unless treatment continues with ALN -AS1.  
Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain assessments, 
and narcotic use.  Patients will also be provided with laboratory sample collection kits and instructions 
for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center.  
A Safety Review Comm ittee (SRC) will review safety and tolerability data collected during the study 
with the primary purpose of protecting the safety of patients participating in the study.  
Number of Planned Patients  
Up to 24 patients are planned for enrollment in this study (including optional cohorts in 
ALN -AS1-001). 
Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria  
Patients with AIP, who have completed Part C of study ALN -AS1-001, will be eligible for screening in 
this study .  Eligible patients will not be on a scheduled regimen of hemin to prevent porphyria attacks 
at Screening.  Patients with alanine transaminase ≥2.0× upper limit of normal, total bilirubin ≥2  mg/dL 
(unless bilirubin elevation is due to Gilbert’s syndrome),  or estimated glomerular filtration rate 
≤30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) at Screening are not 
eligible for this study.  
Investigational Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
ALN -AS1 Solution for Injection (s ubcutaneous use [SC]) is comprised of a synthetic, small interfering 
RNA targeting ALAS1 and bearing a triantennary N -acetyl galactosamine ligand conjugated to the 
sense strand, formulated in phosphate buffer.   
The study starting dose and regimen of ALN -AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg as an SC injection administered every 
3 months.  Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may approve changes to the dosing regimen,

dosing reg imen will not exceed a previously explored dose level or frequency that was determined to 
be safe and well -tolerated in study ALN -AS1-001, SRC, Health Authority and Ethics Committee 
approval must be sought prior to dose escalation above 5.0 mg/kg in accord ance with local Regulatory 
requirements.  
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Not applicable  
Duration of Treatment and Study  
The duration of treatment is up to 36 months.  The estimated total time on study, inclusive of 
Screening/Baseline , for each patient is up to 44 months.  
Statistical Methods  
Statistical analyses will be primarily descriptive.  Incidence of AEs will be summarized by maximum 
severity and relationship to ALN -AS1.  Incidence of and serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs 
leading to discontinuation will also be tabulated.  By -patient listings will be provided for deaths, SAEs, 
and events leading to discontinuation.  
Laboratory shift tables from baseline to worst values will be presented.  Abnormal physical 
examination findi ngs and electrocardiogram data will be presented in by -patient listings.  Descriptive 
statistics will be provided for electrocardiogram interval data and presented as both actual values and 
changes from baseline relative to each on study evaluation and to the last evaluation on -study.  
Clinical activity of ALN -AS1 will be summarized primarily by descriptive statistics.  The clinical 
activity of ALN -AS1 will be evaluated by the frequency and characteristics of porphyria attacks 
including duration, treatment, and severity of porphyria attacks and number and duration of visits to a 
health care setting for acute porphyria care.  Patient diary recordings, including BPI -SF questionnaire 
scores, will also be summarized.   
PD analysis will include the evaluation of c hange in ALA, PBG, and ALAS mRNA levels.  Descriptive 
statistics (eg, mean and standard error of the mean) for observed levels of PD parameters and the 
relative change from baseline will be presented for each of the postdose follow -up time points.  
The PK c oncentration of ALN -AS1 will be determined.  Antidrug antibody results will be tabulated 
overall and by previous treatment in the previous study (ALN -AS1-001).  A by -patient listing will also 
be provided.  
Additional exploratory analyses may be conducted on  analytes related to targeting the heme 
biosynthesis pathway.  Quality of life scores will also be summarized.

 When scheduled at the same time points, assessments of vital signs and 12 -lead ECGs should be performed first, before the physical 
examinations and blood/urine sample collections.  
a Patients are not required to complete Screening/Baseline assessments if the assessments in the previous study (ALN-AS1-001) were completed within 60 days 
of administration of the first dose of ALN-AS1 in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed since the last assessment, clinical laboratory tests and ECGs 
will be repeated before administration of ALN-AS1.  Results should be available and deemed acceptable before the administration of the first dose of ALN-
AS1.

ALN-AS1 Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 4_02 August 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 9 b After a patient has completed 12 months of ALN-AS1 administration in this study, and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, 
study procedures, including ALN-AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional.  Study procedures may occur at the
patient’s home at the discretion of the Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical
study center Q6M.  Additional visits to collect clinical laboratory samples may occur at home at any point during the treatment period, within 14 days prior to 
scheduled dose administration. 
c See Section  7.1 for details on the interval medical history/disease history to be recorded at Screening/Baseline.  Ongoing AEs from the previous study 
(ALN-AS1-001) will be captured as medical history. 
d A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening/Baseline, and D1.  At all other visits, a targeted physical examination will be performed.  On 
dosing days, the physical examination will be performed predose.  On days when ALN-AS1 is not administered, the physical examination can occur at any time 
during the visit.  See Section  7.5.3  for details on the physical examination. 
e Height will be measured at Screening/Baseline only. 
f Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate.  On D1, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose; and 2 hours 
(±10 minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose.  On days when ALN-AS1 is not administered, vital signs 
can be collected at any time during the visit.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be consistent for each patient), after the 
patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes. 
g Using central ECG equipment, triplicate 12-lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine position after the patient has rested comfortably for 5 minutes. 
On at least two of the following visits, ECGs will be performed within 1 hour predose and 2 hours (±15 minutes) postdose:  D1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, 
Month 12 , Month 15, or Month 18 .  In patients receiving >2.5 mg/kg ALN-AS1, ECGs will be performed within 1 hour predose and 4 hours ( ±20  minutes) 
postdose on at least two of the following visits:  D1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 12, Month 15, or Month 18 .  On all other dosing days, ECGs will be collected 
within 1 hour predose (see Section  7.5.4  for ECG assessment details). 
h Clinical laboratory p
arameters are described in Section  7.5.5 .  On dosing days, blood samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected predose.  On 
days when ALN-AS1 is not administered, blood samples can be collected at any time during the visit. On dosing days, results from hematology, chemistry 
(including LFTs), and coagulation tests collected within the prior 14 days must be reviewed by the Investigator before study drug administration.  If results 
from within the prior 14 days are not available at a dosing visit, locally analyzed predose assessments may be used for review in order to allow same day study 
drug administration, but additional samples for central analysis must also be collected. 
i A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening/Baseline; thereafter, urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  Results must be available before dosing. 
j ALN-AS1 will be administered by SC injection according to the Pharmacy Manual.  See Section  6.2.2  for ALN-AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  For 
weight-based dosing, weight measured on the dosing day will be used to calculate the dose of ALN-AS1.  After M12, weight measured on the nearest previous 
visit will b e used to calcu late the weight-based dos e o
f ALN-AS1. 
k Spot urin e samp les will b e collected for measurement of ALA, PBG, and creatinin e levels.  On dosing days, samp les should b e collected predose. 
l On dosing days, blood and urine samples for ALAS1 mRNA (and possible biomarker) analysis will be collected within 1 hour predose. 
m Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points listed in
 Table 4 (Appendix Section  11.1) .  Blood sample collection for PK analysis at 
Month 9 and Month 15 is only
 necessary if ECG will be performed at same visit. 
n On dosing days, blood samples for antidrug antibody analys
is should be collected within 1 hour predose. 
o Porphyria attack laboratory sample collection kits should be dispensed at the screening visit along with instructions for use. For any attack that occurs through
M39, urine samples should be collected within 24 hours of the start of clinical intervention (eg, hemin or glucose administration) and within 24 hours of the end
of clinical intervention.  If patients are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laboratory sample collection kits will be provided
that contain instructions for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center, if possible.  These urine samples may also be analyzed for
exploratory biomarkers.

Amendment 4_02 August 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential     10 p In addition to the time points indicated, the EQ- 5D-5L questionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a porphyria attack 
(but not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible.  
q Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain assessments, and narcotic use on a daily basis through M9; 
thereafter, acute porphyria attacks will be recorded in the diary.  The BPI will be completed on a weekly basis as part of the patient diary through M9, then 
Q3M. 
r Patients will be contacted by phone to collect AEs and concomitant medications.  Patients will also be reminded to collect and send urine samples to the clinical 
study center, if possible, if they are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack. 
s Medications that are ongoing from the previous study (ALN-AS1-001), started between the previous study and this study, and started after signing informed 
consent in this study, will be captured as concomitant medication(s).

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   21 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Disease Overview 
The porphyrias are a family of rare metabolic disorders predominately caused by a genetic 
mutation in 1 of the 8 enzymes responsible for heme synthesis. [1]  The  2 major categories are 
erythropoietic and hepatic, depending on the major site of expression of the underlying enzyme 
deficiency .[2]  I n addition, the porphyrias are classified as acute if patients present with 
neurovisceral symptoms (eg, abdominal pain and neurologic symptoms) or cutaneous if they 
present with dermal blistering or photosensitivity. [3, 4]   
This study will include patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), the most common acut e 
hepatic porphyria (AHP).  AIP occurs as a result of an autosomal dominant mutation leading to 
partial deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase (PB
GD), the third enzyme in the heme 
biosynthesis pathway .[5]  The  rate limiting step in heme synthesis is the upstream enzyme 
5-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1), which is controlled by feedback repression via the 
end-product heme.  In response to a decrease in endogenous heme in the liver, as can occur with 
fasting, hormonal alterations, or with cytochrome P450 (CYP) inducing drugs, ALAS1 is 
induced, resulting in increased flux through the heme synthesis pathway.  In patients with AI
P, 
this can result in the marked accumulation of the toxic heme intermediates porphobilinogen 
(PBG) a
nd delta aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in the blood and urine due to the deficiency in the 
downstream PBGD.  Clinically, this manifests as acute attacks characterized by severe 
abdominal pain, cardiovascular as well as neurologic and psychiatric dysfunction. [6] 
1.1.1. Epidemiology 
Over 370 mutations have been identified in the PBGD gene, which in most instances result in its 
reduction by approximately 50%.  The exact prevalence of AIP is unknown due to under 
diagnosis, variation by geographic region, and the differences in pe
netrance observed for the 
different mutations .[2]  How ever, it is estimated that the prevalence of AIP is 5 to 10 per 
100,000 people in Western countries, while in Sweden it occurs in 1 in 1,000 people due to a 
founder effect associated with the resultant G593A mutation .[7-10]   AIP shows incomplete 
penetrance and on average only 10% to 50% of carriers with a mutation present with clinical 
symptoms. [11]  It  has been proposed that unknown inherited co-factors, in addition to PBGD 
mutations, may explain why a small percentag
e of patients present with much more severe 
disease while the majority remain asymptomatic. 
Patients with AIP present with acute attacks characterized by neurovisceral s
ymptoms and signs 
including severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or less commonly diarrhea, 
hypertension, tachycardia, fever, muscle weakness, as well as neurological (eg, neuropathy, 
seizures) and psychiatric (eg, anxiety and confusion) manifestations .[12]  AIP attacks typically 
start after puberty and can be triggered by exogenous factors such as medications (especially 
barbiturates, sulfonamides, and hydantoins), stress, exogenous hormones, nutritional status, and 
infection.  Clinically active disease is more common in women, where a
ttacks often occur around 
the menstrual cycle and are likely precipitated by hormonal changes. 
Many AIP patients remain undiagnosed given that the disease is rare and characterized by 
non-specific symptoms (eg, abdominal pain and nausea). [2]  The  initial diagnosis involves 
338
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 4_02 August 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   22 demonstrating elevated urinary PBG (typically 20-50 × normal reference range) and ALA 
(typically 5-20 × normal reference range) when the patient is having acute attack symptoms.  
Once a test is positive for elevated ALA and PBG and porphyria is suspected, genetic testing for 
a PBGD mutation is performed.   
There are 4 main clinical phenotypes of AIP.  Latent gene carriers have never had an acute attack 
and are biochemically inactive (normal urinary ALA and PBG).  Asymptomatic high excreters 
(ASHE) do not have current acute attacks, but are biochemically active (increased urinary ALA 
and PBG).  The increased levels of ALA and PBG in ASHE patients are lower than those in AIP 
patients during an acute attack, but are still significantly higher than normal reference values. [6-
8]  Sporadic attack patients have infrequent acute attacks.  Recurrent attack patients have 
≥4 attacks per year requiring hospitalization or treatment by a medical professional. [7] 
1.1.2. Current Management and Unmet Medical Need 
Ma
nagement of acute attacks often requires hospitalization.  Patients are initially treated with 
supportive care and carbohydrate loading, analgesics and anti-emetics, and removal of known 
precipitating factors. [13]  In patients with moderate to severe attacks, or who fail to respond to 
supportive measures, treatment with intravenous (IV) hemin (daily for 3-5 days) is commenced.  
Symptoms typically begin to improve after 2 to 5 days of hemin treatment, accompanied by a 
lowering of urinary ALA and PBG levels to below or at the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
reference value; however
, in some patients attacks can last several weeks, requiring prolonged 
hemin use and hospitalization. [14]  With prolonged and severe attacks, cranial nerve 
involvement can occur, leading to bulbar paralysis
, respiratory failure, and death .[15]  
Hemin, a blood derived therapy, was approved as Normosang® (heme arginate) in the European 
Union (EU) and as Panhematin® (lyophilised hematin) in the United States (US) in 1999 and 
1983, respectively. [16, 17 ]  In the EU, heme arginate is indicated for the treatment of acute 
att
acks of hepatic porphyria (eg, AIP, variegate porphyria, and hereditary coproporphyria); 
whereas, in the US lyophilized hemin is limited to the amelioration of recurrent attacks of AIP 
temporally related to the menstrual cycle.  Approval of both products was based on biochemical 
efficacy (ie, lowering of ALA and PBG) as well as data from uncontrolled case series and case 
reports.[ 18-22]   Hemin side effects include thrombophlebitis, transient anticoagulation, and in 
rare
 cases, anaphylaxis or renal failure .[22-24]   I n addition, hemin administration requires a large 
vein for administration, often necessitating central venous access. 
While the majority of patients who experience attacks have them sporadically, it is estimated that 
up to 1,000 AIP patients experience recurrent attacks (typically defined as ≥4 per year) in the US 
and EU combined .[25]  While hemin is currently only approved to ameliorate acute attacks, it is 
admi
nistered prophylactically in some patients with recurrent attacks (eg, administered every 
1-2 weeks). [26]  Potential problems associated with chronic hemin administration include 
infusion site phlebitis, iron overload, and the need for chronic IV access and associated 
complications (eg, risk of infection or occlusion). [5]  In addition, there have been reports of a 
decrease in efficacy with chronic hemin administration, as evidenced by the need to increase the 
frequency or dosage of hemin prophylaxis over time in attempt to maintain a clinical effect. [27]  
In patients with very severe recurrent attacks, or in whom hemin treatment is not effective, liver 
transplantation can b
e curative; however, organ transplantation is a high-risk procedure and is 
rarely used as a treatment option [34].   Given the significant morbidity and mortality, there 
339
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 4_02 August 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   23 remains a significant unmet need for an efficacious, simple, fast-acting and better tolerated 
treatment for acute or prevent recurrent attacks in patients with AIP. 
1.2. RNA Interference 
RNA interference (RNAi) is a naturally occurring cellular mechanism mediated by small 
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for regulating gene expression.  Typically, synthetic siRNAs are 
19 to 25 base pair double stranded oligonucleotides in a staggered duplex with a 2-nucleotide 
overhang at both or 1 of the 3’ ends .[28]  Suc h siRNAs can be designed to target an endogenous 
messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript of a given gene.  When introduced into cells, the net effec
t 
of an RNAi-based pharmacological approach is the binding of the siRNA to its complementary 
mRNA sequence, cleavage of this target mRNA, and reduction of synthesis of the target protein, 
resulting in a decrease of the target protein levels. [29]  The  ability to selectively and potently 
degrade the mRNA encoding the ALAS1 protein (thereby decreasing a
ccumulation of the toxic 
intermediates ALA and PBG) using an siRNA is a novel approach for the prevention and 
treatment of acute attacks in patients with AIP.   
1.3. ALN-AS1 
ALN-AS1 comprises a synthetic siRNA covalently linked to a GalNAc containing ligand 
(ALN60519), specific for ALAS1 and formulated for administration via subcutaneous (SC) 
injection. ALN-60519 has a target region between nucleotide 918 to 937 of the ALAS1 mRNA. 
Attachment to a triantennary GalNAc ligand to the siRNA enables its distribution to the liver 
(which is the primary site of ALAS1 synthesis), followed by intracellular delivery to hepatocytes 
via ASGPR, resulting in engagement of the RNAi pathway and suppression of hepatic ALAS1 
protein synthesis. 
ALN-AS1 is currently in development for treatment of acute attacks in patients with AIP, the 
most common AHP. 
Further information on ALN-AS1, including the clinical and nonclinical experience to date, is 
available in in the curre nt version of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
1.4. Study Design Rationale 
This is a multicenter, open-label extension study designed to evaluate the long-term safety and 
clinical activity of subcutaneously administered ALN-AS1 in patients with AIP who have 
completed clinical study ALN-AS1-001.  The primary endpoint for the study is the incidence of 
AEs. 
1.5. Dose Rationale 
Clinical data from Part A and Part B of the ongoing study ALN-AS1-001 demonstrate that single 
(0.035-2.5 mg/kg) and multiple (0.35-1.0 mg/kg) doses of ALN-AS1 have been generally 
well-tolerated in patients with AIP who are ASHE.  Additionally, data from this study indicate 
that a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg ALN-AS1 results in near normalization of urine ALA and PBG 
levels, which is sustained for approximately 14 weeks.   
Patients in Part C of the ongoing study ALN-AS1-001 who are eligible for
 participation in this 
study will likely require a higher dose of ALN-AS1 to normalize ALA and PBG as they have 
340
ALN-AS1  Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 4_02 August 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 24 higher levels of ALAS1 upregulation and higher baseline levels of ALA and PBG, when 
compared to patients with AIP who are ASHE. [30]  For example, based on preliminary data in 
Part A and Part B of the ALN-AS1-001 study, the mean PBG level of patie
nts who are ASHE is 
21.9 mmol/mol Cr (N=28); whereas, in Part C of this study in patients with AHP who have 
recurrent porphyria attacks, the mean PBG level is approximately 49.3 mmol/mol Cr (N=12). 
The study starting dose and regimen of ALN-AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg as an SC injecti
on administered 
every 3 months.  Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may approve changes to the 
ALN-AS1 dosing regimen, including decreases in the dose level and changes in dosing 
fre
quency.  However, any dosing regimen will not exceed a previously explored dose level or 
frequency that was determined to be safe and well-tolerated in study ALN-AS1-001. SRC, 
Health Authority and Ethics Committee approval must be sought prior to dose level escalation 
above 5.0 mg/kg in accordance with local Regulatory requirements. 
The study starting dose and regimen was selected based on the benefit:risk profile of ALN-AS1 
in Part C of the
 ongoing ALN-AS1-001 study.  Preliminary data to date indicate that 
administration of 5.0 mg/kg ALN-AS1 has been generally well-tolerated.  There have been no 
study drug-related SAEs, severe AEs, or clinically significant changes in safety parameters.  
While a single 2.5 mg/kg dose of ALN-AS1 has also been generally well-tolerated when 
administered to patients in Part A and Part C of study ALN-AS1-001, this dose has not resulted 
in near normalization of ALA and PBG levels.  In addition, while emerging data from Part C 
indicate that an every 3 months dose of 2.5 mg/kg ALN-AS1 demonstrated some clinical acti
vity 
(eg, decrease in attack frequency and decrease in heme use), some patients continued to 
experience breakthrough porphyria attacks during the treatment period, indicating that a higher 
dose may be required. 
The duration of dosing in this study is supported by the overall favorable safety profile of 
ALN-AS1 in the ongoing clinical study ALN-AS1-001 and the absence of new findings in 
nonclinical studies with ALN-AS1.

1.6.1.  Clinical Pharmacodynamics 
Dosing has been completed in Part A and Part B of the study.  In both Parts A and B of the study, 
durable and dose-dependent reductions of ALAS1 mRNA (up to 66% in the 2.5 mg/kg dose 
group) as measured by cERD  were observed after AL
N-AS1 treatment.  ALAS1 reductions were 
highly correlated with reductions in ALA (mean maximal 86%)
 PBG (mean maximal 95%) 
levels in a dose-dependent manner and were sustained for ≥180 days. 
Dosing is currently ongoing in Part C of the study. The mean maximal reduction in ALAS1 
mRNA relative to baseline in ALN-AS1-treated patients in Cohort 1 (2.5 mg/kg Q3M) was 39% 
and in Cohort 2 (2.5 mg/kg Q1M) 66%.   All patients treated with ALN-AS1 also had decreases 
in their peak ALA and PBG levels in the treatment period compared to the run-in period, along 
with reduced fluctuations in these levels in the treatment period ( data not shown). No reductions 
were observed in the placebo-treated patients.  
1.6.2.  Clinical Activity 
Clinical activity was not evaluated in Parts A and B of the study because ASHE patients included 
in this study were not actively experiencing attacks of porphyria. 
Dosing is currently ongoing in Part C of the study. All patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 were enrolled 
in a run-in phase for 10-15 weeks that was followed by a treatment phase for up to 24 weeks.  No 
investigational product was administered during the run-in phase.  Therefore, each patient acted 
as their own control, allowing for individual ALA / PBG levels, and overall attack rate while on 
ALN-AS1 treatment to be compared to that observed in the run-in phase.  
Figure 1 shows in C ohort 1 ALN-AS1-treated patients there was a 74% mean decrease in the 
annualized attack rate for the treatment period versus the run-in period (range: 63-94% 
reduction), compared with a 23% decrease in the annualized attack rate for the placebo-treated 
patient.  In ALN-AS1-treated patients this was accompanied by an approximate 76% mean 
decrease in annualized acute hemin usage (range 52-95%) and a 10.3 times increase in the 
maximal attack free interval compared to run-in period (range 4.2-16.3).

34% reduction in the annualized attack rate for the treatment period versus the run-in period.  In 
ALN-AS1-treated patients, the reduction in attack rate was accompanied by a 92% mean 
decrease in annualized hemin usage (range 84-100%) and a 2.7x increase in the mean maximal 
attack free interval compared to run-in period (ran
ge 2.1-3.2).

1.6.3. Clinical Safety 
In Part A and Part B of the study, 
a total of 11 patients (11/13; 85.0%) who
 received ALN-AS1 
reported at least 1 AE.  All 5 placebo-treated patients (5/5; 100%) re
ported at least 1 AE.  AEs 
considered possibly or definitely related to ALN-AS1 were reported in 5 patients (5/13; 38%): 
diarrhoea, dyspepsia, hematochezia, injection site erythema, injection site pain, blood creatinine 
increased, glomerular filtration rate decreased, and hypoesthesia (each AE reported only by an 
individual patient; 1/13; 8% each).  There were 2 SAEs of abdominal pain: 1 patient each in the 
0.035 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg ALN-AS1 dose groups.  Both were considered to be not related and 
resolved without sequelae.  There were no AEs leading to discontinuation.  All AEs were mild or 
moderate in severity, except for 1 of the SAEs of abdominal pain (0.10 mg/kg dose group), 
which was considered severe. Adverse events related to abnormal laboratory values were seen in 
343
ALN-AS1  Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 4_02 August 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 27 1 patient in the 0.35 mg/kg ALN-AS1 dose group who had AEs of ALT increased and AST 
increased, which were moderate and considered by the Investigator to be unrelated to ALN-AS1.  
No clinically significant findings were observed with routine monitoring of CRP and a panel of 9 
proinflammatory cytokines collected predose and up to 24 hours post -dose.  There were no other 
clinically significant laboratory abnormalities related to study drug
 or changes in vital signs, or 
ECGs in patients who were administered ALN AS1 or placebo.  
Dosing is ongoing in Part C of the study. All patients who received ALN-AS1 in cohort 1 and 2 
reported at least 1 AE.  AEs that were reported in at least 2 subjects were nausea in 3 patients 
(50%) and abdominal pain, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, headache, cough and oropharyngeal pain 
in 2 patients (33.3%) each.  All AEs were mild or moderate in severity.  AEs considered possibly 
or definitely related to ALN-AS1 were reported in 4 patients (66.6%), 1 each:  renal impairment 
in Cohort 1 and injection site reaction, myalgia, and headache in Cohort 2. Both placebo-treated 
patients reported AEs.  No AE was experienced in more than 1 patient. 
In Part C, Cohort 1 or 2, there were no SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation in patients 
administered ALN-AS1 or placebo. No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities related to 
study drug or changes in vital signs, ECG, or physical exam findings were observed in patients 
administered ALN-AS1 or placebo. 
Part C Cohort 3 5.0 mg/kg SC monthly dosing is ongoing.  In this cohort there was one fatal 
SAE of acute pancreatitis, which was determined to be unlikely related to study drug or placebo 
by the Investigator due to the presence of gall bladder sludge found at the time of her 
presentation.  Contributors to this patient's adverse clinical course included: pre-existing c
hronic 
debilitation from recurrent AIP attacks requiring monthly hospitalizati
on, porphyria-attributed 
quadriplegia requiring nursing home care, delay in hospital admission and complications from 
thromboembol
ism (multiple risk factors included pancreatitis, obesity, immobilisation from 
quadriparesis and recent hospitalization for infected portacath removal).  Serum lipase was added 
to all scheduled laboratory assessments in November 2016 as part of additional safet
y 
monitoring. To date, all lipase results (available in 11 of 15 subjects) ha ve been at or below the 
upper limit of normal with no trends seen with dosing of study drug or placebo. 
1.7. Benefit-R
isk Ass
essment 
Patients participating in this study may experience a reduced number or severity of porphyria 
attacks, reduced treatment with IV hemin, and/or reduced requirement for pain medication.  As 
presented in Section  1.6, emerging data demonstrate that patients given ALN-AS1 experienced 
reduc
ed ALA/PBG levels, decreased attack frequency and reduced heme usage in the 24-week 
treatment period compared to the 12-week run-in period in Study ALN-AS1-001 
As detailed in Section  1.6, a fa tal SAE of hemorrhagic pancreatitis was reported but deemed to 
be unlikely related to study drug.  However, the potentially non-adverse nonclinical finding of 
angiectasis in the islets of Langerhans (endocrine, not exocrine region) of the rat pancreas (see 
Investigator Brochure), do not exclude a potential association between ALN-AS1 and the SAE of 
hemorrhagic p
ancreatitis. 
The potential risks associated with administration of ALN-AS1 in pa
tients with AIP are as 
follows: 
344
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 4_02 August 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   28  Injection site reactions (ISRs):  ALN-AS1 is administered by SC injection.  In the 
ongoing ALN-AS1 clinical study, AEs of ISRs have been infrequently reported and 
have been mild to moderate in severity with single dosing.  Injection site rotation and 
close monitoring have been implemented in ALN-AS1 clinical studies to reduce the 
potential for ISRs.  
 Serum chemistry and coagulation changes: Since an association between ALN-AS1 
and the fatal SAE of hemorrhagic pancreatitis can not be ruled out, patients will 
undergo routine monitoring of systemic a
nd pancreatic inflammation and coagulation 
throughout the study.  Hematology, chemistry and coagulation results are required to 
be available prior to each dose. 
 Liver function test abnormalities:  As ALN-AS1 is targeted for delivery to the liver, 
and reversible hepatic changes were observed in some animal species, there is a 
potential for development of LFT abnormalitie
s.  To minimize the potential for LFT 
abnormalities, patients are required to have adequate liver function at study entry and 
LFTs are monitored during the study. 
 Reproductive health:  No data are available on the use of ALN-AS1 in pregnancy; 
however, there is no suspicion of human teratogenicity based on class effects or 
genotoxic potential.  ALN-AS1 was neither genotoxic nor c
lastogenic in in vitro and 
in vivo studies.  Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative 
pregnancy test, cannot be breastfeeding, and must be willing to use acceptable 
methods of contraception during studies with ALN-AS1.  
 CYP inhibition:  A study in NHP demonstrated that ALN-AS1 dosing could 
potentially increase the clearance of drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isoform.  As 
contraceptive hormones are meta
bolized via CYP3A, WOCBP must use a barrier 
method of contraception, in addition to hormonal contraception, during study 
participation.  Additionally, Investigators will review all patient medications at study 
start and monitor responses to these medications during the study.  A list of 
medications that are sensitive CYP3A substrates is in Table 7 in Appendix 
Section 11.3.  In addition, a list of medications that are sensitive CYP3A substrates is 
available at the Indiana University, Divis
ion of Clinical Pharmacology, website. [31] 
The complete summary of the cli

4. INVESTIGATION
AL PLAN 
4.1. Summary of Study Design 
This is a Phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label extension study to evaluate the long-term safety and 
clinical activity of ALN-AS1 in patients with AIP who completed study ALN-AS1-001.  The 
study will be conducted at up to 8 clinical study centers worldwide. 
The last assessments performed, determining previous study (ALN-AS1-001) completion, will 
serve as the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed 
since the last assessment, safety assessments (eg, ECG and clinical laboratory tests) will be 
repeated before administration of ALN-AS1.  It is anticipated that patients will begin ALN-AS1 
administration in this study within 6 months after the last dose of study drug in the previous 
346

Amendment 4_02 August 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   30 study.  Eligibility will be confirmed during Screening/Baseline and before administration of the 
first dose of ALN-AS1 (Day 1).  Patients will undergo assessments at the clinical study center 
every month for the first 3 months.  Then, through Month 6, and according to the dosing regimen 
selected, assessments will take place at the clinical study center or via a phone contact (for an 
every month dosing regimen, visits will be every month; for an every 3 months dosing regimen, 
visits will be every 3 months; see Section  6.2.2).  After a patient has completed 12 months of 
ALN-AS1 administration in this study (6 months in an every month dosing regimen), and where 
applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, study proce
dures, including 
ALN-AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s home by a healthc are professional (as 
indicated in the Schedules of Assessments in  Table 1  and Table 2; and Table 5 a nd Table 6 in 
Appendix Section 11.2) .  Study procedures
 may occur at the patient’s home at the discretion of 
the Investigator, based on safety and toler
ability; however, patients are required to complete at 
least 1 visit at the clinical st
udy center every 3 months for the first year, and thereafter every 6 
months through the end of the treatment period.  Additional visits to collect clinical laboratory 
samples may occur at home at any point during the treatment period, within 14 days prior
 to 
scheduled dose administration.  Patients will return to the clinical study center for a 
posttreatment follow-up visit after administration of the last dose of ALN-AS1.  An ALA/PBG 
Monitoring/EOS visit will be conducted either at the clinical study center or via phone contact, 
unless treatment continues with ALN-AS1. 
Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain 
assessments, and narcotic use.  Additionally, patients will be encouraged to report to the clinical 
study center if they experience a porphyria attack through Month 39.  In the event that patients 
are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laboratory sample 
collection kits containing instructions for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical 
study center, if possible, will be provided.  Patients will be contacted by phone after a porphyria 
attack to record attack details.  If patients are experiencing signs and symptoms of a porphyria 
attack when ALN-AS1 administration is scheduled, the Investigator will determine whether 
administration of ALN-AS1 is appropriate.  If patients are treated for a porphyria attack at a 
health care facility (eg, hospital, emergency department, infusion center, or outpatient clinic) 
other than the clinical study center, copies of medical records, including discharge summaries, 
will be requested.   
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review safety and tolerability data collected during the 
study with the primary purpose of protecting
 the safety of patients participating in the study (see 
Section  4.6).

This is an open-label study, and all patients will receive ALN-AS1. 
4.6. Safety Review Committee 
An SRC will be involved in the conduct of this study.  The SRC has the responsibility for 
monitoring the safety of the study participants.  The SRC will perform periodic reviews of safety 
and tolerability data during the course of the clinical study at least every 3 months for the first 
6 months of the study and thereafter at least every 6 months.  The SRC may also meet on an ad 
hoc basis for review of emergent safety 
and tolerability data, as defined in the SRC Charter for 
this clinical study.  The SRC will not stop the study for efficacy. 
The SRC will be comprised of the following members:  Principal Investigator(s), or designee(s),

Patients discontinuing from study drug or withdrawing from the study will not be replaced. 
6. TREATMENTS 
6.1. Treatments Adminis tered  
ALN-AS1 Solution for Injection (SC use) is a cle
ar, colorless to pale yellow solution essentially 
free of particulates.  ALN-AS1 will be supplied by the Sponsor as a sterile solution for SC 
injection. 
Study drug supplied for this study must not be used for any purpose other than the present study 
and must not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study.  Study drug that has been 
dispensed to a patient and returned unused must not be re-dispensed to a different patient. 
6.2. Investigational Study Drug 
Detailed information describing the preparation, handling, and storage, packaging and labeling, 
as well as study drug accountability for ALN-AS1 is provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
6.2.1. Description 
ALN-AS1 Solution for Injection (SC use) is comprised of a synthetic, siRNA targeting ALAS1 
and bearing a triantennary GalNAc ligand conjugated to the sense stra
nd, formulated in 
phosphate buffer.  
6.2.2. Dose and Adm inistr ation 
The study starting dose of ALN-AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg ALN-AS1 as an SC injection administered 
every 3 months (Table 1 a nd Table 2). Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may approve 
changes to the ALN-AS1 dosing regimen, including decreases in the dose level and changes in 
dosing frequency (Table 5 and Table 6 in Appendix Section 11.2). However, any dose and 
dosing regime n will not exceed a previously explored dose level or frequency that was 
determined to be safe and well-tolerated in study ALN-AS1-001. SRC, Health Authority and 
Ethics Committee approva
l must be sought prior to dose level escalation above 5.0 mg/k
g in 
350
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 4_02 August 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   34 accordance with local Regulatory requirements.  See Section  6.2.3 for  details on dose 
modifications. 
The study drug will be administered under the supe
rvision of a healthcare professional.  After a 
patient has completed 12 months of ALN-AS1 administration in this study (6 months in an every 
month dosing regimen), and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure 
allow, study procedures, including ALN-AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s 
home by a healthcare professional.  Study proce
dures may occur at the patient’s home at the 
discretion of the Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to 
complete at least 1 visit at the clinical study center every 3 months for the first year, and 
thereafter every 6 months through the end of the treatment period.  Additional visits to collect 
clinical laboratory samples may occur at home a
t any point during the treatment period, within 
14 days prior to scheduled dose administration. 
If a patient does not receive a dose of ALN-AS1 within the specified dosing window, the 
Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor.  After such consultation, the dose may be 
administered or considered missed and not administered. 
Patients will be permitted to miss an occasional dose of study drug; however, if a patient misses 
2 consecutive doses, the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, will discuss 
whether the patient will be able to continue on the study.  
Detailed instructions for study drug administration are found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
6.2.3. Dose Modifications 
6.2.3.1. Study Population Dose Modifications 
During the study, dos
e modifications are permitted for the study population, or based on the dose 
cohort into which patients were originally randomized in study ALN-AS1-001.  Following SRC 
review of emerging safety and tolerability data from Part C of study ALN-AS1-001, or from this 
study (ALN-AS1-002), the dose and dosing regimen may be modified.  However, the dose and 
dosing regimen of ALN-AS1 will not exceed a previously explored dose and dosing regimen that 
was determined to be safe and well-tolerated in study ALN-AS1-001.  Patients enrolling in this 
study after a dose modification decision has been implemented may start at the newly identified 
dose and regimen. 
6.2.3.2. Individual Dose Modifications 
Dose modifications are permitted for individual patients.  If a patient has a study drug related AE 
of a recurrent ISR, severe ISR, or clinically significant LFT abnormality and the Investigator has 
concerns regarding further ALN-AS1 administration, the Medical Monitor and Investigator will 
review all available safety data for the patient.  Based on this review, a dose reduction to half the 
previously administered dose (eg, a 5.0 mg/kg dose would be reduced to a 2.5 mg/kg dose) or a 
reduction in dosing frequency from monthly to every 3 months is permitted.  Subsequent 
ALN-AS1 administration at the previous dose may be considered based on the judgment of the 
Investigator and Medical Monitor.

Amendment 4_02 August 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   35 6.2.4.  Preparation, Handling, and Storage 
Staff at each clinical study center or the home healthcare professional will be responsible for 
preparation of ALN-AS1 doses, according to procedures deta
iled in the Pharmacy Manual.  No 
special procedures for the safe handling of study drug are required. 
Study drug will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately 5±3°C.  Any deviation from 
the recommended storage conditions should be reported to the Sponsor and use of the study drug 
halted until authorization for its continued use has been provided by the Sponsor or designee. 
A Sponsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, 
storage, dispensing procedures, and records. 
6.2.5. Packaging and Labeling 
ALN-AS1 Solution for Injection (SC use) is packaged in 2 mL glass vials with a fill volume of 
no less than 0.55 mL.  The container closure system consists of a Type I glass vi
al, a Teflon 
faced bromobutyl 13 mm stopper and a flip-off Truedge aluminum seal. 
6.2.6. Accountability 
The Investigator or designee will maintain accurate records of receipt and the condition of the 
study drug supplied for this study, including dates of rece
ipt.  In addition, accurate records will 
be kept of when and how much study drug is dispensed and administere
d to each patient in the 
study.  Any reasons for departure from the protocol dispensing regimen must also be recorded. 
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of all study drugs.  All used, 
partially used, and unused study drug will be returned to the Sponsor (or designee) or destroyed 
at the clinical study center according to applicable regulations.   
6.3. Concomitant Medications 
Use of concomitant medications will be recorded on the patient’s case report form (CRF) as 
indicated in the Schedules of Assessments (Table 1 a nd Table 2; and Table 5 a nd Table 6 in 
Appendix Section 11.2).  T his includes all prescription medications, herbal preparations, over the 
counter (OTC) medications, vitamins, and minerals.  Any changes in medica
tions during the 
study will also be recorded on the CRF. 
Any concomitant medication that is required for the patie
nt’s welfare may be administered by the 
Investigator.  However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding 
the medication are recorded on the eCRF.  Concomitant medication will be coded using an 
internationally recognized and accepted coding dictionary. 
ALN-AS1 could potentially increase the clearance of drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isoform.   
Investigators will review all medications at study start and monitor response to these medications 
during the study.  For patients who require new medications while on study, selection of 
medications that are not mainly metabolized by the CYP3A isoform is recommended.  A list of 
medications that are sensitive CYP3A substrates is included in Table 7 Appendix Section 11.3.  
In addition, a more detailed and current list of sensitive CYP3A-metabolized medications and 
CYP3A-metabolized medications with a narrow therapeutic range is available a

Patients are not permitted to be on hemin prophylaxis at Screening; however, patients are 
permitted to receive concomitant hemin treatment for the management of
 acute porphyria 
attacks.  Patients experiencing significant breakthrough attacks while enrolled in this study, 
necessitating frequent hemin treatment, may receive hemin prophylaxis if in the Investigator’s 
judgment this is clinically beneficial to the patient.  The Investigator should contact with the 
Sponsor and Medical Monitor before prophylactic hemin treatment.  The dose, regimen, and 
dates of administration will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF.   
Pa
in medication (eg, opiates, opioids, narcotic analgesics) and glucose administration are 
permitted for the management of porphyria and for acute porphyria attacks. 
If patients use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications intermittently or chronically, they 
must have been able to tolerate them with no previous side effects (eg, gastric distress or 
bleeding).   
Standard vitamins and topical medications are permitted; however, topical steroids must not be 
applied anywhere near the injection site(s) unless medically indicated. 
6.4. Contraceptive Requirements 
WOCBP must be willing to use acceptable methods of contraception 14 days before first dose, 
throughout study participation, and for 90 days after last dose admi
nistration.  Birth control 
methods which may be considered as acceptable include: 
 Established use of oral, impla
ntable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal methods of 
contra
ception.  WOCBP using hormonal methods of contraception must also use a 
barrier method (condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault cap] in 
conjunction with spermicide [eg, foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository]).  If 
hormonal methods of contraception are medically contraindicated for WOCBP due to 
underlying disease, a double-barrier method (combinati
on of male condom with 
either cap, diaphragm, or sponge, in conjunction with spermicide) is also considered 
an acceptable method of contraception. 
 Placement of an intrauterine device  
 Placement of an intrauterine hormone-releasing system  
 Bilateral tubal occlusion 
 Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post-vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the 
study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient) 
 True sexual abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
patient.  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  Abstinent 
patients must agree to use 1 of the abovementioned contraceptive methods, if they 
start sexual relationships during the study and for 90 days after last dose 
administration. 
353
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   37 WOCBP includes any female patient who has experienced menarche and who is not 
postmenopausal or permanently sterilized (eg, bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, or 
bilateral salpingectomy).  Postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without 
an alternative medical cause, confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone level within the 
postmenopausal range. 
6.5. Treatment Compliance 
Compliance with study drug administration will be verified through observation by study 
personnel or trained home healthcare professionals.  
7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
The schedule of study assessments is provided in Table 1.  
7.1. Screening/Baseline Assessments 
Informed consent, patient demographic data, a
nd eligibility criteria will be confirmed at 
Screening/Baseline.  An interval medical history/disease history will be obtained at 
Screening/Baseline.  The last assessments performed, determining previous study 
(ALN-AS1-001) completion, will serve as the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If 
more than 60 days have elapsed since the last assessment, clinical laboratory tests and ECGs will 
be repeated before administration of ALN-AS1. 
7.2. Clinical Activity Assessments 
The clinical activity of ALN-AS1 will be assessed by the frequency and characteristics of 
porphyria attacks including, but not limited to, duration, treatment, and severity
 of porphyria 
attacks and number and duration of visits to a health care setting for acute porphyria care (eg, 
hospital, emergency department, infusion center, or outpatient clinic).  Concomitant hemin 
administration will also be recorded. 
7.2.1. Patient Diary 
Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphy
ria attacks, pain 
assessments, and narcotic use.

7.5. Safety Assessments 
The assessment of safety during the course of the study will consist of the surveillance and 
recording of AEs including SAEs, recording of concomitant medications and measurements of 
vital signs, physical examination, and ECG findings and clinical laboratory evaluations. 
Safety will be monitored over the course of the study by an SRC as described in Section  4.6. 
7.5.1. Vital Signs 
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory 
rate.  Vita
l signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be consistent for each 
patient), after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  Blood pressure should be taken 
using the same arm throughout the study.  Body temperature will be obtained in degrees Celsius, 
heart rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in beats per minute, and respiration rate 
will be counted for a full minute and recorded in breaths per minute. 
For the safety of the patient, additional vital sign assessments may be added at the discretion of 
the Investigator. 
7.5.2.  Weight and Height 
Height will be measured in centimeters at the Screening/Baseline visit only.  Body weight will be 
measured in kilograms.  Body mass index will be calculated in the database. 
7.5.3. Physical Examination 
Complete physical examinations will include the examination of the following:  gene
ral 
appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, chest/respiratory, heart/cardiovascular, 
gastrointestinal/liver, musculoskeletal/extremities, dermatological/skin, thyroid/neck, lymph 
nodes, and neurological/psychiatric. 
Targeted physical examinations will include the examination of the following:  general 
appearance, chest/respiratory, heart/cardiovascular, gastrointestinal/liver, and

ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 4_02 August 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   39 (Table 1).  Patien ts should be seated or supine for at least 5 minutes before each ECG is 
obtained.  The electrophysiological parameters assessed will be rhythm, ventricular rate, PR 
interval, QRS duration, QT interval, ST and T waves, Bazett-corrected QT interval (QTcB), and 
Fridericia corrected QT interval (QTcF). 
When ECG and blood sample collection occur at the same time, ECGs should be performed 
before blood samples are drawn. 
In all patients receiving ≤2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1, it is required that ECGs will be obtained on at 
least 2 s
eparate clinic visits (D1, and Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or 18), each of which will include 
same day predose and 2-hour (±15 minutes) postdose readings, paired with PK timepoints 
(Table 4) as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1) .   
Similarly, in all patients receiving >
2.5 mg/kg ALN-AS1, it is required that ECGs will be 
obtained on at least 2 se
parate 
clinic visi ts (D1, and Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or 18), each of which 
will include same day predose and 4-hour (±20 minute
s) postdose readings, paired with PK 
timepoints ( Table 4), a s specified in the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 1 ).   
The Investigator or designe e is responsible for reviewing the ECGs to a
ssess whether the results 
have changed since the
 S
creening/Baseline visit and to determine the clinical relevance of the 
results.  These
 assessments will be recorded on the eCRF.  For any clinically relevant ECG 
changes from the Scree
ning/Baseline visit (eg, ischemic ECG changes, wave/interval changes, or 
arrhythmia), the Investigator must contact the Medical Monitor to discuss continued participation 
of the patient in the study. 
7.5.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory.  
 
On dosing days up to the Month 18 visit, results from hematolog
y, chemistry, and coagulation 
tests collected within the prior 14 days must be reviewed by the Investigator before study drug 
administration.  These results can be anal
yzed centrally or at a local laboratory.  If results from 
within the prior 14 days are not available at a dosing visit (at visits from D1 to Month 18), 
locally analyzed assessments may
 be reviewed to allow same day study drug administration, but 
additional samples for c
entral analysis must also be collected. 
In the event of an unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study 
drug administration, the test should be repeated and followed up at the discretion of the 
Investigator until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis is made to 
adequately explain the abnormality. 
At any point during the study, and based on Investigator judgment, if a patient experiences 
uncharacteristic signs and symptoms during a porphyria attack, lipase testing should be 
performed and imaging evaluations (eg, right upper quadrant ultrasound and/or other testing, 
based on Investigator judgment) should be considered by the Investigator.  Signs and symptoms 
include, but are not limited to, uncharacteristic abdominal pain and worsening nausea and 
vomiting. 
Imaging is required fo r any serum lipase result of ≥3× the upper limit of normal, or as clinically 
indicated.

Amendment 4_02 August 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   41 7.5.5.1. Immunogenicity 
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate antidrug antibodies.  On days when ALN-AS1 is 
administered, blood samples for antidrug antibody testing must be collected before ALN-AS1 is  
administered. 
Details regarding the processing, shipping, and analysis of the samples will be provided in the 
Laboratory Manual. 
7.5.5.2. Pregnancy Testing 
A pregnancy test will be performed for WOCBP only.  A serum pregnancy test will be 
performed at Screening/Baseline and urine pregnancy tests will be performed thereafter per the 
Schedule of Assessments and any time pregnancy is s
uspected.  Urine pregnancy tests may also 
be performed more frequently (eg, monthly) based on local country requirements.  The results of 
the pregnancy test must be known before study drug administration.  Patients who are pregnant 
are not eligible for study participation.  Any woman with a positive pregnancy test during the 
study will be discontinued from study drug, but will continue to be followed for safety.  Patients 
determined to be pregnant while on study will be followed until the pregnancy outcome is known 
(see Section 7.5.6.6 fo r follow-up instructions).  
7.5.6. Adverse Events 
7.5.6.1. Definitions 
Adverse Event 
According to the IC
H E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 
21 Code of Federal Regulations 312.32, Investigational New Drug Safety Reporting, an AE is 
any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or c
linical investigational subject administered a 
medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal re
lationship with this treatment. 
Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening (An event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the e
vent as it occurred.  It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death) 
 Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above (eg, 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
358
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 4_02 August 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   42 room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug 
dependency or abuse). 
Adverse Event Severity 
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below: 
Mild:  Mild events are those which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal 
daily activity.  
Mod erate:  Moderate events are those which cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with 
normal daily activities.  
Severe:  Severe events are those which incapacitate and prevent usual activity.  
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity.  AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of the start and stop of each incidence.  When changes in the severity of an AE 
occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day should 
be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be 
recorded separately (with distinct onset dates) 
AE severity and seriousness are assessed independently.  ‘Severity’ characterizes the intensity of 
an AE.  ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for Serious Adverse Event). 
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Treatment 
The relationship of each AE to study treatment should be evaluated by the Investigator using the 
following criteria:  
Definitely related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to the medic ation administration, and which 
cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
The response to withdrawal of the drug should be clinically plausible.  
Possibly related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to the medication administration, but which 
could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals.  Information on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or 
unclear.  
Unlikely related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no 
temporal relationship to medication administration, and which other 
drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations.  
Not related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality  that has no 
temporal relationship to the medication or has more likely alternative 
etiology.  
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest 
The following events are considered to be adverse events of clinical interest: 
359
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 4_02 August 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   43  ISRs 
 Hepatic AEs, including LFT abnormalities considered clinically significant by the 
Investigator . 
7.5.6.2. Eliciting and Recor
ding Adverse Eve
nts 
Eliciting Adverse Events 
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last 
visit.  The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospitalized, had any accidents, used 
any new medications, or changed 
concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC).  
In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant 
laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are 
relevant to patient safety. 
Recording Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for recording non-serious AEs that are observed or reported by 
the patient after administration of the first dose of study drug regardless of their relationship to 
study drug through the end of study.  Non-serious AEs will be followed until the end of study.  
The Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by the patient 
after the time when the informed consent is signed regardless of their relationship to study drug 
through the end of study.  SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until baseline level 
is reached, or until the SAE is considered by the Investigator to be chronic or the patient is 
stable, as appropriate. 
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for 
the patient, whether or not they are considered to be drug-related.  Each AE must be described in 
detail:  onset time and date, description of event, severit
y, relationship to investigational drug, 
action taken, and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
For SAEs, record the event(s) on the eCRF.  If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is 
unavailable, complete the backup SAE form. 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest, additional clinical information may be 
collected based upon the severity or nature of the event. 
If a patient has ISRs meeting any of the following criteria, the Investigator or delegate should 
contact the Medical Monitor and submit a supplemental ISR eCRF: 
 ISRs that are recurrent and/or demonstrate a pattern of increasing severity 
 Any ISR that is determined to be severe and/or a cause for study drug discontinuation  

 Any ISR which, in the opinion of the Investigator, requires further medical evaluation or 
treatment 
In some cases, wher
e it is medically appropriate, further evaluation may include photographs, 
referral to a dermatologist, skin biopsy, or other laboratory testing.  If a biopsy was obtained, the 
Sponsor may request that the biopsy also be reviewed by a central dermatopathologist.  To better 
understand the safety profile of the study drug, additional analysis of biopsy tissue may be 
performed according to local regulations.

ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 4_02 August 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   44 For patients with hepatic AEs, additional information, including, clinical history, course of event, 
and local laboratory results to monitor LFT levels or other laboratory parameters, may be 
collected. 
7.5.6.3. Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee 
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by the Investigator.  Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section 7.5.6.1 must  be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee within 24 hours from the time that clinical study center personne
l first 
learns of the event.  All SAEs must be reported regardless of the relationship to study drug. 
The initial report should include at least the following information: 
 Patient’s study number  
 Description and date of onset of the event 
 Criterion for serious 

 Preliminary assignment of re
lationship to study dr
ug 
 Investigator/clinical study center information 
To re
port the SAE, complete the eCRF.  If the EDC system is unavail
able, complete the backup 
SAE form.  Within 24 hours of receipt of follow-up information, the Investigator must update the 
report.  SAEs must be reported using the contact information provided in the Study Manual. 
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken by the Investigator using his/her best medical 
judgment to treat the SAE.  These measures and the patient’s response to these measures should 
be recorded.  All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be
 followed by the 
Investigator until satisfactory resolution or the Investigator deems the SAE to be chronic or 
stable.  Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed by the Investigator as 
needed to adequately determine the etiology of the event. 
7.5.6.4. Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities 
The Sponsor or its representative is required to report certain study events in an expedited 
manner to the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency’s EudraVigilance 
electronic system according to Directive 2001/20/EC, and to all country Regulatory Authorities 
where the study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations. 
The following describes the safety reporting timeline requirements for susp
ected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) and other reportable events: 
Immediately and within 7 calendar days 
 Any suspected adverse reaction that is associated with the use of the study drug, 
unexpected, and fatal or life threatening.  Follow-u
p information must be reported in 
the following 8 days. 
361
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 4_02 August 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   45 Immediately and within 15 calendar days 
 Any suspected adverse reaction that is associated with the use of the study drug, 
unexpected, and serious, but not fatal or life threatening, and there is evide
nce to 
suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the reaction. 
 Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggest a significant risk for human 
patients including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or c
arcinogenicity. 
 Any event in connection with the conduct of the study or the development of the 
study drug that may affect the safety of the trial pa
tients. 
In addition, periodic safety reporting to regulatory authorities will be performed by the Sponsor 
or its representative according to national and local regulations.
 
7.5.6.5. Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
SUSARs will be reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) per their institutional policy by the Investigator or Sponsor (or Sponsor 
designee) according to country requirements.  Copies of each report and documentation of 
IRB/IEC notification and acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator’s study 
file. 
7.5.6.6. Pregnancy Reporting 
If a female patient b
ecomes pregnant during the course of this study through 90 days following 
the last dose of study drug, the Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee 
within 24 hours of being notified of the pregnancy.  Details of the pregna
ncy will be recorded on 
the pregnancy reporting form.  The patient should receive
 any necessary counseling regarding 
the risks of continuing the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. 
The pregnancy should be followed by the Investigator until completion.  At the compl
etion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy.  If the outcome of the 
pregnancy results in a postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
or congenital anomaly, then the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE 
as outlined in Section 7.5.6.3 .   
7.5.6.7. Overdose Reporting 
An overdose is defined as any dose administ
ered to or taken by a patient (accidentally or 
intentionally) that exceeds the highest daily dose, or is at a higher frequency, than included in the 
protocol.  It is up to the investigator to decide whether a dose is to be considered an overdose, in 
consultation with the Sponsor.  Overdose must be recorded in the eCRF. 
All reports of overdose (with or without an AE) must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor 
or designee.

a Patients are not required to complete Screening/Baseline assessments if the assessments in the previous study (ALN-AS1-001) were completed within 60 days 
of administration of the first dose of ALN-AS1 in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed since the last assessment, clinical laboratory tests and ECGs 
will be repeated before administration of ALN-AS1.  Results should be available and deemed acceptable before the administration of the first dose of ALN-
AS1. 
374
ALN-AS1      Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 4_02 August 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential      58 b After a patient has completed 6 months of ALN-AS1 administration in this study, and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, 
study procedures, including ALN-AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional.  Study procedures may occur at the 
patient’s home at the discretion of the Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical 
study center Q3M through M12, and thereafter Q6M. Additional visits to collect clinical laboratory samples may occur at home at any point during the 
treatment period, within 14 days prior to scheduled dose administration. 
c See Section  7.1 for details on the interval medical history/disease history to be recorded at Screening/Baseline.  Ongoing AEs from the previous study 
(ALN-AS1-001) will be captured as medical history. 
d A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening/Baseline, and D1.  At all other visits, a targeted physical examination will be performed.  On 
dosing days, the physical examination will be performed predose.  On days when ALN-AS1 is not administered, the physical examination can occur at any time 
during the visit.  See Section  7.5.3  for details on the physical examination. 
e Height will be measured at Screening/Baseline only. 
f Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate.  On D1, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose; and 2 hours 
(±10 minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose.  On days when ALN-AS1 is not administered, vital signs 
can be collected at any time during the visit.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be consistent for each patient), after the 
patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes. 
g Using central ECG equipment, triplicate 12-lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine position after the patient has rested comfortably for 5 minutes.  
On at least two of the following visits, ECGs will be performed within 1 hour predose and 2 hours (±15 minutes) postdose:  D1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, 
Month 12, Month 15, or Month 18.  In patients receiving >2.5 mg/kg ALN-AS1, ECGs will be performed within 1 hour predose and 4 hours (±20 minutes) 
postdose on at least two of the following visits:  D1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 12, Month 15, or Month 18.  On all other dosing days, ECGs will be collected 
within 1 hour predose (see Section  7.5.4  for ECG assessment details). 
h Clinical laboratory parameters are described in Section  7.5.5 .  On dosing days, blood samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected predose.  On 
days when ALN-AS1 is not administered, blood samples can be collected at any time during the visit. On dosing days up to the Month 18 visit,results from 
hematology, chemistry (including LFTs), and coagulation tests collected within the prior 14 days must be reviewed by the Investigator before study drug 
administration.  If results from within the prior 14 days are not available at a dosing visit (at visits from D1 to Month 18), locally analyzed predose assessments 
may be used for review in order to allow same day study drug administration, but additional samples for central analysis must also be collected. 
i A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening/Baseline; thereafter, urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  Results must be available before dosing. 
j ALN-AS1 will be administered by SC injection according to the Pharmacy Manual.  See Section  6.2.2  for ALN-AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  For weight-
based dosing, weight measured on the dosing day will be used to calculate the dose of ALN-AS1.  After M12, weight measured on the nearest previous visit 
will be used to calculate the weight-based dose of ALN-AS1. 
k Spot urine samples will be collected for measurement of ALA, PBG, and creatinine levels.  On dosing days, samples should be collected predose. 
l On dosing days, blood and urine samples for ALAS1 mRNA (and possible biomarker) analysis will be collected within 1 hour predose. 
m Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points listed in  Table 4  (Appendix Section 11.1).  Blood sample collection for PK analysis at 
Month 9 and Month 15 is only necessary if ECG will be performed at same visit. 
n On
 dosing days, blood samples for antidrug antibody analysis should be collected within 1 hour predose. 
o Porphyria attack laboratory sample collection kits should be dispensed at the screening visit along with instructions for use. For any attack that occurs through 
M39, urine samples should be collected within 24 hours of the start of clinical intervention (eg, hemin or glucose administration) and within 24 hours of the end 
of clinical intervention.  If patients are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laboratory sample collection kits should be used 
for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center, if possible.  These urine samples may also be analyzed for exploratory biomarkers. 
p In addition to the time points indicated, the EQ- 5D-5L questionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a porphyria attack 
(but not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible.

ALN-AS1      Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 4_02 August 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential      59 q Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain assessments, and narcotic use on a daily basis through M9; 
thereafter, acute porphyria attacks will be recorded in the diary.  The BPI will be completed on a weekly basis as part of the patient diary through M9, then 
Q3M. 
r Medications that are ongoing from the previous study (ALN-AS1-001), started between the previous study and this study, and started after signing informed 
consent in this study, will be captured as concomitant medication(s).

ALN-AS1      Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 4_02 August 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential      62 b Patients who discontinue treatment will be asked to complete the M39 visit assessments.  If a patient chooses to withdraw from the study, every effort should 
be made to conduct early the assessments performed at the M39 visit.  See Section  5.3 for details on removal from treatment or assessment. 
c The ALA/PBG Monitoring/EOS visit will be conducted at the clinical study center or via phone contact, unless treatment continues with ALN-AS1.  Patients 
will be provided with laboratory sample collection kits and instructions for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center.  Urine samples 
should not be collected during a porphyria attack. 
d A complete physical examination will be performed at the posttreatment follow-up visit.  At all other visits, a targeted physical examination will be performed.  
On dosing days, the physical examination will be performed predose.  On days when A LN-AS1 is not administered, the physical examination can occur at any 
time during the visit.  See Section  7.5.3  for details on the physical examination. 
e Height will be measured at Screening/Baseline only. 
f Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate.  On a dosing days, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose.  On 
days when ALN-AS1 is not administered, vital signs can be collected at any time during the visit.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position 
(should be consistent for each patient), after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes. 
g Using central ECG equipment, triplicate 12-lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine position after the patient has rested comfortably for 5 minutes.  
ECGs will be performed within 1 hour predose and 2 hours (±15 minutes) postdose.  In patients receiving >2.5 mg/kg ALN-AS1, ECGs will be performed 
within 1 hour predose and 4 hours (±20 minutes) postdose (see Section  7.5.4  for ECG assessment details). 
h Clinical laboratory parameters are described in Section  7.5.5 .  On dosing days, blood samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected predose.  On 
days when ALN-AS1 is not administered, blood samples can be collected at any time during the visit. On dosing days, results from hematology, chemistry 
(including LFTs), and coagulation tests collected within the prior 14 days must be reviewed by the Investigator before study drug administration.  If results 
from within the prior 14 days are not available at a dosing visit, locally analyzed predose assessments may be used for review in order to allow same day study 
drug administration, but additional samples for central analysis must also be collected. 
i Urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  Results must be available before dosing. 
j ALN-AS1 will be administered by SC injection according to the Pharmacy Manual.  See Section  6.2.2  for ALN-AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  Weight 
measured on the nearest previous visit will be used to calculate the weight-based dose of ALN-AS1. 
k Spot urine samples will be collected for measurement of ALA, PBG, and creatinine levels.  On dosing days, samples should be collected predose. 
l On dosing days, blood and urine samples for ALAS1 mRNA (and possible biomarker) analysis will be collected within 1 hour predose. 
m Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points listed in  Table 4  (Appendix Section 11.1). 
n On dosing days, blood samples for antidrug antibody analysis should be collected within 1 hour predose. 
o In addition to the time points indicated, the EQ- 5D-5L questionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a porphyria attack 
(but, not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible.  
p Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks.  The BPI will be completed as part of the patient diary Q3M.

A Multicenter, Open-label Extension Study to Evaluate the Long-term Safety and Clinical 
Activity of Subcutaneously Administered ALN AS1 in Patients with Acute Intermittent 
Porphyria who have Completed a Previous Clinical Study with ALN-AS1 
 
Rationale for Protocol Amendment 
This protocol is being amended to update the ECG assessments to  obtain triplicate 12-lead ECGs 
using central equipment and paired with plasma PK at times correspondin
g to nominal maximum 
concentration (C max). 
Also, Schedule of Assessments footnotes and related tex
t were updated to define the visit range 
in which previously noted predose interpretation of hematology, coa
gulation, and chemistry test 
results are required. 
A detailed summary of the changes is provided in Table 1.  C orrections to typographical errors

 Amendment 4 Summary of Changes_02 August 2017 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 2 Table 1: Protocol Amendment 4 Detailed Summary of Changes 
The primary section(s) of the protocol affected by the changes in the protocol amendment are indicated.  The corresponding text has 
been revised throughout the protocol.  Deleted text is indicated by strikeout; added text is indicated by bold  font. 
Purpose : To update te xt to require that same day predose  and postdose ECG readings will be obtained from at least 2 separate clinic 
visits.  
The primary change occurs in Section 7.5.4 Electrocardiogram  
Added text:  Triplicate standard 12-lead ECG ECGs  will be performed using central ECG equipment , with readings 
approximately 2 minutes apart, will be recorded.  Additional ECGs may be collected at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  Standard computerized 12 -lead ECG recordings will be obtained.  Each le ad shall be recorded for 
at least 3 beats at a speed of 25 mm/s.  Recordings will be obtained, after the patient has rested comfortably for 
approximately 10 minutes 1 minute apart  and recorded as specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 
1).  Patients  should be seated or supine for at least 5 minutes before each ECG is obtained .  The 
electrophysiological parameters assessed include will be  rhythm, ventricular rate, PR interval, QRS duration, 
QT interval, ST and T waves, Bazett -corrected QT interval (QTc B), and Fridericia - corrected QT interval 
(QTcF).  
When ECG and blood sample collection occur at the same time, ECGs should be performed before blood 
samples are drawn.  
In all patients receiving ≤2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1, it is required that ECGs will be obtained on at least 2 
separate clinic visits  (D1, and Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or 18) , each of which will include same day predose 
and 2 -hour (±15 minutes) postdose readings, paired with PK timepoints ( Table 4 ) as specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ).   
Similarly, in all patients receiving >2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1, it is required that ECGs will be obtained on at 
least 2 separate clinic visits  (D1, and Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or 18) , each of which will include same day 
predose and 4 -hour (±20 minutes) postd ose readings, paired with PK timepoints ( Table 4 ), as specified in 
the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ).   
The Investigator or designee is responsible for reviewing the ECGs to assess whether the results have changed 
since the Screening/Baseline visit and  to determine the clinical relevance of the results.  These assessments will 
be recorded on the eCRF.  For any clinically relevant ECG changes from the Screening/Baseline visit (eg, 
ischemic ECG changes, wave/interval changes, or arrhythmia), the Investiga tor must contact the Medical 
Monitor to discuss continued participation of the patient in the study.

Study Design  
This is a multicenter, open -label extension study to evaluate the long -term safety and clinical activity 
of ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP who completed study ALN -AS1-001. 
The last assessments performed, determining previous study (ALN -AS1-001) completion, will serve as 
the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed since the last 
assessment, safety assessments will be repeated before administration of ALN -AS1.  It is anticipated 
that patients will begin ALN -AS1 administration in this study within 6 months after the last dose of 
study drug in the previous study.  Eligibility wi ll be confirmed before administration of the first dose of 
ALN -AS1 (Day 1).  Patients will undergo assessments at the clinical study center every month for the 
first 3 months.   Then, through Month 6, and according to the dosing regimen selected, assessment s will 
take place at the clinical study center or via a phone contact (for an every month dosing regimen, visits 
will be every month; for an every 3 months dosing regimen, visits will be every 3 months).  A fter a 
patient has completed 12 months of ALN -AS1 administration in this study (6 months in an every 
month dosing regimen), and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, 
study procedures, including ALN -AS1 administration , may take place at the patient’s home by a 
healthcare professional.  Study procedures  may occur at the patient’s home at the discretion of the 
Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit 
at the clinical study center every 3 months for the first y ear, and thereafter every 6 months through the 
end of the treatment period.  Additional visits to collect c linical laboratory samples may occur at home 
at any point during the treatment period, within 14 days prior to scheduled dose administration.  
Patien ts will return to the clinical study center for a posttreatment follow -up visit after administration 
of the last dose of ALN -AS1.  An ALA/PBG Monitoring/EOS visit will be conducted either at the 
clinical study center or via phone contact, unless treatment continues with ALN -AS1.  
Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain assessments, 
and narcotic use.  Patients will also be provided with laboratory sample collection kits and instructions 
for collecting and s ending urine samples to the clinical study center.  
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review safety and tolerability data collected during the study 
with the primary purpose of protecting the safety of patients participating in the study.  
Number of Plan ned Patients  
Up to 24 patients are planned for enrollment in this study (including optional cohorts in 
ALN -AS1-001). 
Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria  
Patients with AIP, who have completed Part C of study ALN -AS1-001, will be eligible for screening in 
this study.  Eligible patients will not be on a scheduled regimen of hemin to prevent porphyria attacks 
at Screening.  Patients with alanine transaminase ≥2.0× upper limit of normal, total bilirubin ≥2  mg/dL 
(unless bilirubin elevation is due to Gilbert ’s syndrome), or estimated glomerular filtration rate 
≤30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) at Screening are not 
eligible for this study.  
Investigational Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
ALN -AS1 Solution for  Injection (subcutaneous use [SC]) is comprised of a synthetic, small interfering 
RNA targeting ALAS1 and bearing a triantennary N -acetyl galactosamine ligand conjugated to the 
sense strand, formulated in phosphate buffer.   
The study starting dose and reg imen of ALN -AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg as an SC injection administered every 
3 months.  Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may approve changes to the dosing regimen, 
388
ALN-AS1  Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 3_03  February 2017 
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 6 including decreases in the dose level and changes in the dosing frequency.  However any dose a nd 
dosing regimen will not exceed a previously explored dose level or frequency that was determined to 
be safe and well -tolerated in study ALN -AS1-001, SRC, Health Authority and Ethics Committee 
approval must be sought prior to dose escalation above 5.0 mg /kg in accordance with local Regulatory 
requirements.  
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Not applicable  
Duration of Treatment and Study  
The duration of treatment is up to 36 months.  The estimated total time on study, inclusive of 
Scree ning/Baseline, for each patient is up to 44 months.  
Statistical Methods  
Statistical analyses will be primarily descriptive.  Incidence of AEs will be summarized by maximum 
severity and relationship to ALN -AS1.  Incidence of and serious adverse events (SAE s) and AEs 
leading to discontinuation will also be tabulated.  By -patient listings will be provided for deaths, SAEs, 
and events leading to discontinuation.  
Laboratory shift tables from baseline to worst values will be presented.  Abnormal physical 
examin ation findings and electrocardiogram data will be presented in by -patient listings.  Descriptive 
statistics will be provided for electrocardiogram interval data and presented as both actual values and 
changes from baseline relative to each on study evaluat ion and to the last evaluation on -study.  
Clinical activity of ALN -AS1 will be summarized primarily by descriptive statistics.  The clinical 
activity of ALN -AS1 will be evaluated by the frequency and characteristics of porphyria attacks 
including duration, treatment, and severity of porphyria attacks and number and duration of visits to a 
health care setting for acute porphyria care.  Patient diary recordings, including BPI -SF questionnaire 
scores, will also be summarized.   
PD analysis will include the eval uation of change in ALA, PBG, and ALAS mRNA levels.  Descriptive 
statistics (eg, mean and standard error of the mean) for observed levels of PD parameters and the 
relative change from baseline will be presented for each of the postdose follow -up time point s. 
The PK concentration of ALN -AS1 will be determined.  Antidrug antibody results will be tabulated 
overall and by previous treatment in the previous study (ALN -AS1-001).  A by -patient listing will also 
be provided.  
Additional exploratory analyses may be c onducted on analytes related to targeting the heme 
biosynthesis pathway.  Quality of life scores will also be summarized.

scheduled dose administration. 
c See Section  7.1 for details on the interval medical history/disease history to be recorded at Screening/Baseline.  Ongoing AEs from the previous study 
(ALN-AS1-001) will be captured as medical history. 
d A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening/Baseline, and D1.  At all other visits, a targeted physical examination will be performed.  On 
dosing days, the physical examination will be performed predose.  On days when ALN-AS1 is not administered, the physical examination can occur at any time 
during the visit.  See Section  7.5.3  for details on the physical examination. 
e Height will be measured at Screening/Baseline only. 
f Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate.  On D1, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose; and 2 hours 
(±10 minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose.  On days when ALN-AS1 is not administered, vital signs 
can be collected at any time during the visit.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be consistent for each patient), after the 
patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes. 
g Triplicate 12-lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine position after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  On D1, ECGs will be 
performed within 1 hour predose and 2 hours (±10 minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, ECGs will be collected within 1 hour predose. 
h Clinical laboratory parameters are described in Section  7.5.5.  On dosing days, blood samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected predose.  On 
days when ALN-AS1 is not administered, blood samples can be collected at any time during the visit. On dosing days, results from hematology, chemistry 
(including LFTs), and coagulation tests collected within the prior 14 days must be reviewed by the Investigator before study drug administration.  If results 
from within the prior 14 days are not available at a dosing visit, locally analyzed predose assessments may be used for review in order to allow same day study 
drug administration, but additional samples for central analysis must also be collected. 
i A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening/Baseline; thereafter, urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  Results must be available before dosing. 
j ALN-AS1 will be administered by SC injection according to the Pharmacy Manual.  See Section  6.2.2  for ALN-AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  For 
weight-based dosing, weight measured on the dosing day will be used to calculate the dose of ALN-AS1.  After M12, weight measured on the nearest previous 
visit will b e used to calcu late the weight-based dos e of ALN-AS1. 
k Spot urin e samp les will b e collected for measurement of ALA, PBG, and creatinine levels.  On dosing days, samp les should b e collected predose. 
l On dosing days, blood and urine samples for ALAS1 mRNA (and possible biomarker) analysis will be collected within 1 hour predose. 
m Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points listed in Table 4 (Appendix Section  11.1).  
n On dosing days, blood samples for antidrug antibody analysis should b e collected within 1 hour predose. 
o
Porphyria attack laboratory sample collection kits should be dispensed at the screening visit along 
with instructions for use. For any attack that occurs through
M39, urine samples should be collected within 24 hours of the start of clinical intervention (eg, hemin or glucose administration) and within 24 hours of the end
of clinical intervention.  If patients are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laboratory sample collection kits will be provided
that contain instructions for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center, if possible.  These urine samples may also be analyzed for
exploratory biomarkers.
p In addition to the time points indicated, the EQ- 5D-5L questionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a porphyria attack 
(but not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible.  
q Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain assessments, and narcotic use on a daily basis through M9; 
thereafter, acute porphyria attacks will be recorded in the diary.  The BPI will be completed on a weekly basis as part of the patient diary through M9, then 
Q3M. 
r Patients will be contacted by phone to collect AEs and concomitant medications.  Patients will also be reminded to collect and send urine samples to the clinical 
study center, if possible, if they are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 21 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Disease Overview 
The porphyrias are a family of rare metabolic disorders predominately caused by a genetic 
mutation in 1 of the 8 enzymes responsible for heme synthesis.[ 1]  The 2 major categories are 
erythropoietic and hepatic, depending on the major site of expression of the underlying 
enzyme deficiency.[2]  In addition, the porphyrias are classified as acute if patients present 
with neurovisceral symptoms (eg, abdominal pain and neurologic symptoms) or cutaneous if 
they present with dermal blistering or photosensitivity. [3, 4]   
This study will include patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), the most c ommon acute 
hepatic porphyria (AHP).  AIP occurs as a result of an autosomal domina nt mutation leading to 
partial deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), the third enzyme in the heme 
biosynthesis pathway.[5]  The rate limiting step in heme synthesis is the upstream enzyme 
5-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1), which is controlled by feedback repression via the 
end-product heme.  In response to a decrease in endogenous heme in the liver, as can occur with 
fasting, hormonal alterations, or with cytochr ome P450 (CYP) inducing drugs, ALAS1 is 
induced, resulting in increased flux throug h the heme synthesis pathway.  In patients with AIP, 
this can result in the marked accumulation of the toxic heme intermediates porphobilinogen 
(PBG) and delta aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in the blood and urine due to the deficiency in the 
downstream PBGD.  Clinically, this manifests as acute attacks characterized by severe 
abdominal pain, cardiovascular as well as neurologic and psychiatric dysfunction.[6] 
1.1.1. Epidemiology 
Over 370 mutations have been identified in the PBGD gene, which in most instances result in its 
reduction by approximately 50%.  The exact prevalence of A IP is unknown due to under 
diagnosis, variation by geographic region, and the differences in penetrance observed for the 
different mutations.[2]  However, it is estimated that the prevalence of AIP is 5 to 10 per 
100,000 people in Western countries, while in Sweden it occurs in 1 in 1,000 people due to a 
founder effect associated with the resultant G593A mutation .[7-10]  AIP shows incomplete 
penetrance and on average only 10% to 50% of carriers with a mutation present with clinical 
symptoms.[11]  It has been proposed that unknown inherited co-factors, in addition to PBGD 
mutations, may explain why a small percentage of patients present with much more severe 
disease while the major ity remain asymptomatic. 
Patients with AIP present with acute attac ks characterized by neurovisceral sympt
oms and signs 
including severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or less commonly diarrhea, 
hypertension, tachycardia, fever, muscle weakness, as well as neurological (eg, neuropathy, 
seizures) and psychiatric (eg, anxiety and confusion) manifestations .[12]  AIP attacks typically 
start after puberty and can be trigge red by exogenous factors suc h as medications (especially 
barbiturates, sulfonamides, and hydantoins), stress , exogenous hormones, nutritional status, and 
infection.  Clinically active disea se is more common in women, where attacks often occur around 
the menstrual cycle and are likely precipi
tated by hormonal chang
es. 
Many AIP patients remain undiagnosed given that the disease is rare and characterized by 
non-specific symptoms (eg, abdominal pain and nausea).[2]  The initial diagnosis involves 
404
ALN-AS1  Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 3_03 February 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 22 demonstrating elevated urinary PBG (typically 20-50 × normal reference range) and ALA 
(typically 5-20 × normal reference range) when the patient is having acute attack symptoms.  
Once a test is positive for elevated ALA and PBG and porphyria is suspected, genetic testing for 
a PBGD mutation is performed.   
There are 4 main clinical phenotypes of AIP.  Latent gene carriers have never had a n acute attack 
and are biochemically inactive (normal urinary ALA and PBG).  Asymptomatic high excreters 
(ASHE) do not have current ac ute attacks, but are biochemically active (increased urinary ALA 
and PBG).  The increased levels of ALA and PBG in ASHE patients are lower than those in AIP 
patients during an acute attack, but are still significantly higher than normal reference values.[6-
8]Sporadic attack patients have infrequent acute attacks.  Recurrent attack patients have
≥4
 attacks per year requiring hospitalization or treatment by a medical professional. [7] 
1.1.2. Current Management and Unmet Medical Need 
Management of ac ute attacks often requires hospi
talization.  Patients are initially treated with 
supportive care and carbohydrate loading, analgesics and anti-emetics, and removal of known 
precipitating factors.[13]  In patients with moderate to severe attacks, or who fail to respond to 
supportive measures, treatment with intravenous (IV) hemin (daily for 3-5 days) is commenced.  
Symptoms typically begin to improve after 2 to 5 days of hemin treatme nt, accompanied by a 
lowering of urina ry ALA and PBG levels to below or at the uppe r limit of normal (ULN) 
reference value; however, in some patients attacks can last several weeks, requiring prolonged 
hemin use and hospitalization. [14]  With prolonged and severe attacks, cranial nerve 
involvement can occur, leading to bulbar paralysis, respiratory failure, and death .[15]  
Hemin, a blood derived therapy, was approved a s Normosang® (heme arginate) in the European 
Union (EU) and as Panhematin® (lyophilised hematin) in the United States (US) in 1999 and  
1983, respectively.[16, 17]  In the EU, heme arginate is indicated for the treatment of acute 
attacks of hepatic porphyria (eg, AIP, variegate porphyria, and hereditary coproporphyria); 
whereas, in the US lyophilized hemin is limited to the amelioration of recurrent attacks of AIP 
temporally related to the menstrual cycle.  Approval of both products was based on biochemical 
efficacy (ie, lowering of ALA and PBG) as well as data from uncontrolled case series and case 
reports.[18-22]  Hemin side effects include thrombophlebitis, transient anticoagulation, and in 
rare cases, 
anaphylaxis or renal failure.[22-24]  In addition, hemin administration requires a large 
vein for administration, often necessitating centra l venous access. 
While the majority of patients who experience attacks have them sporadically, it is estimated that 
up to 1,000 AIP patients experience recurrent attacks (typically defined as ≥4 per year) in the US 
and EU combined.[25]  While hemin is currently only approved to ameliorate acute attacks, it is 
administered prophylactically in some patients with recurrent attacks (eg, administered every 
1-2 weeks).[26]  Potential problems associated with chronic hemin administration include 
infusion site phlebitis, iron overload, and the need for chronic IV access and associated 
complications (eg, risk of infection or occlusion)
.[5]  In addition, there have been reports of a 
decrease in efficacy with chronic hemin administration, as evidenced by the need to increase the 
frequency or dosage of hemin prophylaxis over time in attempt to maintain a clinical effect.[27]  
In patients with very severe recurrent attacks, or in whom hemin treatment is not effective, liver 
transplantation can be curative; however, organ transplantation is a high-risk procedure and is 
rarely used as a treatment option [34].  Given the significant morbidity and mortality, there 
405
ALN-AS1  Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 3_03 February 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 23 remains a significant unmet need for an efficacious, simple, fast-acting and better tolerated 
treatment for acute or prevent recurrent attacks in patients with AIP. 
1.2. RNA Interference 
RNA interference (RNAi) is a naturally occurring cellular mechanism media ted by small 
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for regulating gene expression.  Typically, synthetic siRNAs are 
19 to 25 base pair double stranded oligonucleotides in a staggered duplex with a 2-nucleotide 
overhang at both or 1 of the 3’ ends.[28]  Such siRNAs can be designed to target an endogenous 
messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript of a g iven gene.  When introduced into cells, the net effect 
of an RNAi-bas
ed pharmacological approach is the bindi ng of the siRNA to its complementary 
mRNA sequence, cleavage of this target mRNA, and reduction of synthesis of the target 
protein, resulting in a decrease of the target protein levels.[29]  The ability to selectively and 
potently degrade the mRNA encoding the ALAS1 protein (thereby decreasing accumulation of 
the toxic intermediates ALA and PBG) using an siRNA is a novel approach for the prevention 
and treatment of acute attacks in patients with AIP.   
1.3. ALN-AS1 
ALN-AS1 comprises a synthetic siRNA covalently linke
d to a GalNAc containing ligand 
(ALN60519), specific for ALAS1 and formulated for administration via subcutaneous (SC) 
injection. ALN-60519 has a target region between nucleotide 918 to 937 of the ALAS1 mRNA. 
Attachment to a triantennary GalNAc ligand to the siRNA enables its distribution to the liver 
(which is the primary site of ALAS1 synthesis), followed by intracellular delivery to hepatocytes 
via ASGPR, resulting in engagement of the RNAi pathway and suppression of hepatic ALAS1 
protein synthesis. 
ALN-AS1 is currently in development for treatment of acute attacks in patients with AIP, the 
most common AHP. 
Further information on ALN-AS1, including the clinical and nonclinical experience to date, is 
available in in the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
1.4. Study Design Rationale 
This is a multicenter, open-label extension study designed to evaluate the long-term safety and 
clinical activity of subcutaneously administered ALN-AS1 in patients with AIP who have 
completed clinical study ALN-AS1-001.  The primary endpoint for the study is the incidence of 
AEs. 
1.5. Dose Rationale 
Clinical data from Part A and Part B of the ongoing study ALN-AS1-001 demonstrate that single 
(0.035-2.5 mg/kg) and multiple (0.35-1.0 mg/kg) doses of ALN-AS1 have been generally 
well-tolerated in patients with AIP who are ASHE.  Additionally, data from this study indicate 
that a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg ALN-AS1 results in near normalization of urine ALA and PBG 
levels, which is sustained for approximately 14 weeks.   
Patients in Part C of the ongoing study ALN-AS1-001 who are eligible f
or participation in this 
study will likely require a higher dose of ALN-AS1 to normalize ALA and PBG as they have 
406
ALN-AS1  Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 3_03 February 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 24 higher levels of ALAS1 upregulation and higher baseline levels of ALA and PBG, when 
compared to patients with AIP who are ASHE.[30]  For example, based on preliminary data in 
Part A and Pa rt B of the ALN-AS1-001 study, the mean PBG level of patients who are ASHE is 
21.9 mmol/mol Cr (N=2
8); whereas, in Part C of this study in patients with AHP who have 
recurrent porphyria attacks, the mean PBG level is approximately 49.3 mmol/mol Cr (N=12). 
The study starting dose and regimen of ALN-AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg as an SC injection administered 
ever
y 3 months.  Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may approve changes to the 
ALN-AS1 dosing regimen, including decreases in the dose level and changes in dosing 
fr
equency.  However, any dosing regimen will not exceed a previously explored dose level or 
frequency that was determined to be safe and well-tolerated in study ALN-AS1-001. SRC, 
Health Authority and Ethics Committee approval must be sought prior to dose level escalation 
above 5.0 mg/kg in accordance with local Regulatory requirements. 
The study starting dose and regimen was selected based on the benefit:risk profile of ALN-AS1 
in Part C of the ongoing 
ALN-AS1-001 study.  Preliminary data to date indicate that 
administration of 5.0 mg/kg ALN-AS1 has been generally well-tolerated.  There have been no 
study drug-related SAEs, severe AEs, or clinically significant changes in safety parameters.  
While a single 2.5 mg/kg dose of ALN-AS1 has also been generally well-tolerated when 
administered to patients in Part A and Part C of study ALN-AS1-001, this dose has not resulted 
in near normalization of ALA and PBG levels.  In addition, while emerging data from Part C 
indicate that an every 3 months dose of 2.5 mg/kg ALN-AS1 demonstrated some clinical activity 
(eg, decrease in attack frequency and decrease in heme use), some patients continued to 
experience breakthrough porphyria attacks during the treatme
nt period, indicating that a higher 
dose may be required. 
The duration of dosing in this study is supported by the overall favorable safety profile of 
ALN-AS1 in the ongoing clinical study ALN-AS1-001 and the absence of new findings in 
nonclinical studies with ALN-AS1.

1.6.1.  Clinical Pharmacodynamics 
Dosing has been completed in Part A and Part B of the study.  In both Parts A and B of the study, 
durable and dose-dependent reductions of ALAS1 mRNA (up to 66% in the 2.5 mg/kg dose 
group) as measured by cERD  were observed after ALN-AS1 treatment.  ALAS1 reductions were 
highly correlated with reductions in ALA (mean maximal 86%)
 PBG (mean maximal 95%) 
levels in a dose-dependent manner and were sustained for ≥180 days.  
Dosing is currently ongoing in Part C of the study. The mean maximal reduction in ALAS1 
mRNA relative to baseline in ALN-AS1-treated patients in Cohort 1 (2.5 mg/kg Q3M) was 39% 
and in Cohort 2 (2.5 mg/kg Q1M) 66%.   All patients treated with ALN-AS1 also had decreases 
in their peak ALA and PBG levels in the treatment period compared to the run-in period, along 
with reduced fluctuations in these levels in the treatment period. No reductions were observed 
in the placebo-treated patients.  
1.6.2.  Clinical Activity 
Clinical activity was not evaluated in Parts A and B of the study because ASHE patients included 
in this study were not actively experiencing attacks of porphyria. 
Dosing is currently ongoing in Part C of the study. All patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 were enrolled 
in a run-in phase for 10- 15 weeks that was followed by a treatment phase for up to 24 weeks.  No 
investigational product was administered during the run-in phase.  The
refore, each patient acted 
as their own control, allowing for individual ALA / PBG levels, and overall attack rate while on 
ALN-AS1 treatment to be compared to that observed in the run-in phase.  
Figure 1 shows in C ohort 1 ALN-AS1-treated patients there was a 74% mean decrease in the 
annualized attack rate for the treatment period ve
rsus the run-in period (range: 63-94% 
reduction), compared with a 23% decrease in the annualized attack rate for the placebo-treated 
patient.  In ALN-AS1-treated patients this was accompanied by an approximate 76% mean 
decrease in annualized acute hemin usage (range 52-95%) and a 10.3 times increase in the 
maximal attack free interval compared to run-in period (range 4.2-16.3).

34% reduction in the annualized attack rate for the treatment period versus the run-in period.  In 
ALN-AS1-treated patients, the reduction in attack rate was accompanied by a 92% mean 
decrease in annualized hemin usage (range 84-100%) and a 2.7x increase in the mean maximal 
attack free interval compared to run-in period (range 2.1-3.2).

1.6.3. Clinical Safety 
In Part A and Part B of the study, a total of 11 patients (11/13; 85.0%) who r
eceived ALN-AS1 
reported at least 1 AE.  All 5 placebo-treated patients (5/5; 100%) re
ported at least 1 AE.  AEs 
considered possibly or definitely related to ALN-AS1 were reported in 5 patients (5/13; 38%): 
diarrhoea, dyspepsia, hematochezia, injection site erythema, injection site pain, blood creatinine 
increased, glomerular filtration rate decreased, and hypoesthesia (each AE reported only by an 
individual patient; 1/13; 8% each).  There were 2 SAEs of abdominal pain: 1 patient each in the 
0.035 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg ALN-AS1 dose groups.  Both were considered to be not related and 
resolved without sequelae.  There were no AEs leading to discontinuation.  All AEs were mild or 
moderate in severity, except for 1 of the SAEs of abdominal pain (0.10 mg/kg dose group), 
which was considered severe. Adverse events related to abnormal laboratory values were seen in 
409
ALN-AS1  Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 3_03 February 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 27 1 patient in the 0.35 mg/kg ALN-AS1 dose group who had AEs of ALT increased and AST 
increased, which were moderate and considered by the Investigator to be unrelated to ALN-AS1.  
No clinically significant findings were observed with routine monitoring of CRP and a panel of 9 
proinflammatory cy tokines collected predose and up to 24 hours post -dose.  There were no other 
clinically significant laboratory abnormalities related to study dru
g or changes in vital signs, or 
ECGs in patients who were administered ALN AS1 or placebo.  
Dosing is ongoing in Part C of the study. All patients who received ALN-AS1 in cohort 1 and 2 
reported at least 1 AE.  AEs that were reported in at least 2 subjects were nausea in 3 patients 
(50%) and 
abdominal pain, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, headache, cough and oropharyngeal pain 
in 2 patients (33.3%) each.  All AEs were mild or moderate in severity.  AEs considered possibly 
or definitely related to ALN-AS1 were reported in 4 patients (66.6%), 1 each:  renal impairment 
in Cohort 1 and injection site reaction, myalgia, and headache in Cohort 2. Both placebo-treated 
patients reported AEs.  No AE was experienced in more than 1 patient. 
In Part C, Cohort 1 or 2, there were no SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation in patients 
administered ALN-AS1 or placebo. No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities related to 
study drug or changes in vital signs, ECG, or physical exam findings were observed in patients 
administered ALN-AS1 or placebo. 
Part C Cohort 3 5.0 mg/kg SC monthly dosing is ongoing.  In this cohort there was one fatal 
SAE of acute pancreatitis, which was determined to be unlikely related to study drug or placebo 
by the Investigator due to the presence of gall bladder sludge found at the time of her 
presentation.  Contributors to this patient's adverse clinical course included: pre-exist
ing chronic 
debilitation from recurrent AIP attacks requiring monthly hospitalizati
on, porphyria-attributed 
quadriplegia requiring nursing home care, delay in hospital admission and complicati
ons from 
thromboembolism (multiple risk factors included pancreatitis, obesity, immobilisation from 
quadriparesis and recent hospitalization for infected portacath removal).  Serum lipase was added 
to all scheduled laboratory assessments in November 2016 as part of additional safe
ty 
monitoring. To date, all lipase results (available in 11 of 15 subjects) ha ve been at or below the 
upper limit of normal with no trends seen with dosing of study drug or placebo. 
1.7. Benefit-Risk Ass
essment 
Patients participating in this study may expe
rience a reduced number or severity of porphyria 
attacks, reduced treatment with IV hemin, and/or reduced requirement for pain medication.  
As presented in Section 1.6, emerging data demonstrate that patients given ALN-AS1 
experienced reduced ALA/PBG levels, decreased attack frequency and reduced heme usage in 
the 24-week treatment period compared to the 12-week run-in period in Study ALN-AS1-001 
As detailed in Section 1.6, a fatal SAE of hemorrhagic pancreatiti
s was reported but deemed to 
be unlikely related to study drug.  However, the potentially non-adv
erse nonclinical finding of 
angiectasis in the islets of Langerhans (endocrine, not exocrine region) of the rat pancreas (see 
Investigator Brochure), do not exclude a potential association between ALN-AS1 and the SAE of 
he
morrhagic pancreatitis. 
The potential risks associated with administration of A
LN-AS1 in patients with AIP are as 
follows: 
410
ALN-AS1  Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 3_03 February 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 28 Injection site reactions (ISRs):  ALN-AS1 is administered by SC injection.  In the
ongoing ALN-AS1 clinical study, AEs of ISRs have been infrequently reported and
have been mild to moderate in severity with single dosing.  Injection site rotation and
close monitoring have been implemented in ALN-AS1 clinical studies to reduce the
potential for ISRs.
Serum chemistry and coagulation changes: Since an association between ALN-AS1
and the fatal SAE of hemorrhagic pancreatitis can not be ruled out, patients will
undergo routine monitoring of systemic and pancreatic inflammation and coagulation
throughout the study.  Hematology, chemistry and coagulation results are required to
be available prior to each dose.
Liver function test abnormalities:  As ALN-AS1 is targeted for delivery to the liver,
and reversible hepatic changes were observed in some animal species, there is a
potential for development of LFT abnormalities.  To minimize the potential for LFT
abnormalities, patients are required to have adequate liver function at study entry and
LFTs are monitored during the study.
Reproductive health:  No data are available on the use of ALN-AS1 in pregnancy;
however, there is no suspicion of human teratogenicity based on class effects or
genotoxic potential.  ALN-AS1 was neither genotoxic nor clastogenic in in vitro and
in vivo studies.  Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative
pregnancy test, cannot be breastfeeding, and must be willing to use acceptable
methods of contraception during studies with ALN-AS1.
CYP inhibition:  A study in NHP demonstrated that ALN-AS1 dosing could 
potentially increase the clearance of drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isoform.  As 
contraceptive hormone s are meta bolized via CYP3A, W
OCBP must use a barrier 
method of contraception, in addition to hormonal contraception, during study 
participation.  Additionally , Investiga tors will review all patient medications at study 
start and monitor responses to these medic ations during 
the study.  A list of 
medications that are sensitive CYP3A substrates is i n Table 7 in Appe ndix
Section 11.3.  In addition, a list of medications that are sensitive CYP3A substrates is  
available at the Indiana University, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, website.[31]

AL PLAN 
4.1. Summary of Study Design 
This is a Phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label extension study to evaluate the long-term safety and 
clinical activity of A LN-AS1 in patients with AIP who completed study ALN-AS1-001.  The 
study will be conducted at up to 8 clinical study centers worldwide. 
The last assessments performed, determining previous study
 (ALN-AS1-001) completion, will 
serve as the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed 
since the last assessment, safety assessments (eg, ECG and clinical laboratory tests) will be 
repeated before administration of ALN-AS1.  It is anticipated that patients will begin ALN-AS1 
administration in this study within 6 months after the last dose of study drug in the previous 
412
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 3_03 February 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   30 study.  Eligibility will be confirmed during Screening/Baseline and before administration of the 
first dose of ALN-AS1 (Day 1).  Patients will undergo assessments at the clinical study center 
every month for the first 3 months.  Then, through Month 6, and according to the dosing regimen 
selected, assessments will take place at the clinical study center or via a phone contact (for an 
every month dosing regimen, visits will be every month; for an every 3 months dosing regimen, 
visits will be every 3 months; see Section  6.2.2).  After a patient has completed 12 months of 
ALN-AS1 administration in this study (6 months in an every month dosing regimen), and where 
applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, stud
y procedures, including 
ALN-AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s home by 
a healthcare professional (as 
indicated in the Schedules of Assessments in  Table 1 a nd Table 2; and Table 5 a nd Table 6 in 
Appendix Section 11.2).  Study procedures ma
y occur at the patient’s home at the discretion of 
the Investigator, based on safety and toler
ability; however, patients are required to complete at 
least 1 visit at the clinical stud
y center every 3 months for the first year, and thereafter every 6 
months through the end of the treatment period.  Additional visits to collect clinical laboratory 
samples may occur at home at any point during the treatment period, within 14 days p
rior to 
scheduled dose administration.  Patients will return to the clinical study center for a 
posttreatment follow-up visit after administration of the last dose of ALN-AS1.  An ALA/PBG 
Monitoring/EOS visit will be conducted either at the clinical study center or via phone contact, 
unless treatment continues with ALN-AS1. 
Patients or caregivers will be provided with a
 diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain 
assessments, and narcotic use.  Additionally, patients will be encouraged to report to the clinical 
study center if they experience a porphyria attack through Month 39.  In the event that patients 
are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laboratory sample 
collection kits containing instructions for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical 
study center, if possible, will be provided.  Patients will be contacted by phone after a porphyria 
attack to record attack details.  If patients are experiencing signs and symptoms of a porphyria 
attack when ALN-AS1 administration is scheduled, the Investigator will determine whether 
administration of ALN-AS1 is appropriate.  If patients are treated for a porphyria attack at a 
health care facility (eg, hospital, emergency department, infusion center, or outpatient clinic) 
other than the clinical study center, copies of medical records, including discharge summaries, 
will be requested.

The duration of treatment is up to 36 months.  The estimated total time on study, inclusive of 
Screening/Baseline, for each patient is up to 44 months.   
4.3. Number of Patients 
Up to 24 patients are planned for e
nrollment in this study (including optional cohorts in 
ALN-AS1-001). 
4.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups 
This is an open-label study; all patients will receive ALN-AS1.  A combination of the clinical 
study center number and screening number will create the unique patient identifier.  The clinical 
study center number will be assigned by the Sponsor.  Upon signing the Informed Consent Form 
(ICF), the patient will be assigned a screening number by the clinical study site, which will be 
the same unique patient identifier assigned in the previous study (ALN-AS1-001).  The 
Investigator, or delegate, will confirm that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of 
the exclusion criteria. 
4.5. Blinding 
This is an open-label study, and all patients will receive ALN-AS1. 
4.6. Safety Review Committee 
An SRC will be involved in the conduct of this study.  The SRC has the responsibility for 
monitoring the safety of the study participants.  The SRC will perform periodic reviews of safety 
and tolerability data during the course of the clinical study at least every 3 months for the first 
6 months of the study and thereafter at least every 6 months.  The SRC may also meet on an ad 
hoc basis for review of emergent safety
 and tolerability data, as defined in the SRC Charter for 
this clinical study.  The SRC will not stop the study for efficacy. 
The SRC will be comprised of the following members:  Principal Investigator(s), or designee(s), 
the Sponsor Medical Monitor, and the Study Medical Monitor. 
The membership of the SRC and reporting structure are further defined in the SRC Charter.

recorded in the appropriate section of the eCRF and all efforts made to complete and report the 
observations as thoroughly as possible.  If a patient withdraws due to a SAE, the SAE should be 
followed as described in Section 7.5.6. 
5.3.3. Replacement of Patients 
Patients discontinuing from study drug or withdrawing from the study will not be replaced. 
6. TREATMENTS 
6.1. Treatments Administered 
ALN-AS1 Solution for Injection (SC use)
 is a clear, colorless to pale yellow solution essentially 
free of particulates.  ALN-AS1 will be supplied by the Sponsor as a sterile solution for SC 
injection. 
Study drug supplied for this study must not be used for any purpose other than the present study 
and must not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study.  Study drug that has been 
dispensed to a patient and returned unused must not be re-dispensed to a different patient. 
6.2. Investigational Study Drug 
Detailed information describing the preparation, handling, and st
orage, packaging and labeling, 
as well as study drug accountability for ALN-AS1 is provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
6.2.1. Description 
ALN-AS1 Solution for Injection (SC use) is comprised of a synthetic, siRNA targeting ALAS1 
and bearing a triantennary GalNAc ligand conjugated to the sense strand, for
mulated in 
phosphate buffer.  
6.2.2. Dose and Adm inistr ation 
The study starting dose of ALN-AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg ALN-AS1 as an SC injection administered 
every 3 months ( Table 1 a nd Table 2). Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may approve 
changes to the ALN-AS1 dosing regimen, including decreases in the dose level and changes in 
dosing frequency (Table 5 and Table 6 in Appendix Section 11.2). However, any dose and 
dosing regime n will not exceed a previously explored dose level or frequency that was 
determined to be safe and well-tolerated in study ALN-AS1-001. SRC, Health Authority and 
Ethics Committee approv
al must be sought prior to dose level escalation above 5.0 mg/k
g in 
416
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 3_03 February 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   34 accordance with local Regulatory requirements.  See Section  6.2.3 for  details on dose 
modifications. 
The study drug will be administered under the supe
rvision of a healthcare professional.  After a 
patient has completed 12 months of ALN-AS1 administration in this study (6 months in an every 
month dosing regimen), and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure 
allow, study procedures, including ALN-AS1 administration
, may take place at the patient’s 
home by a healthcare professional.  Study proce
dures may occur at the patient’s home at the 
discretion of the Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to 
complete at least 1 visit at the clinical study center every 3 months for the first year, and 
thereafter every 6 months through the end of the treatment period.  Additional visits to collect 
clinical laboratory samples may occur at home a
t any point during the treatment period, within 
14 days prior to scheduled dose administration. 
If a patient does not receive a dose of ALN-AS1 within the specified dosing window, the 
Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor.  After such consultation, the dose may be 
administered or considered missed and not administered. 
Patients will be permitted to miss an occasional dose of study drug; however, if a patient misses 
2 consecutive doses, the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, will discuss 
whether the patient will be able to continue on the study.  
Detailed instructions for study drug administration are found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
6.2.3. Dose Modifications 
6.2.3.1. Study Population Dose Modifications 
During the study, dos
e modifications are permitted for the study population, or based on the dose 
cohort into which patients were originally randomized in study ALN-AS1-001.  Following SRC 
review of emerging safety and tolerability data from Part C of study ALN-AS1-001, or from this 
study (ALN-AS1-002), the dose and dosing regimen may be modified.  However, the dose and 
dosing regimen of ALN-AS1 will not exceed a previously explored dose and dosing regimen that 
was determined to be safe and well-tolerated in study ALN-AS1-001.  Patients enrolling in this 
study after a dose modification decision has been implemented may start at
 the newly identified 
dose and regimen. 
6.2.3.2. Individual Dose Modifications 
Dose modifications are permitted for individual patients.  If a patient has a study drug related AE 
of a recurrent ISR, severe ISR, or clinically significant LFT abnormality and the Investigator has 
concerns regarding further ALN-AS1 administration, the Medical Monitor and Investigator will 
review all available safety data for the patient.  Based on this review, a dose reduction to half the 
previously administered dose (eg, a 5.0 mg/kg dose would be reduced to a 2.5 mg/kg dose) or a 
reduction in dosing frequency from monthly to every 3 months is permitted.  Subsequent 
ALN-AS1 administration at the previous dose may be considered based on the judgment of the 
Investigator and Medical Monitor.

Amendment 3_03 February 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   35 6.2.4.  Preparation, Handling, and Storage 
Staff at each clinical study center or the home healthcare professional will be responsible for 
preparation of ALN-AS1 doses, according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy Manual.  No 
special procedures for the safe handling of study drug are required. 
Study drug will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately 5±3°C.  Any deviation from 
the recommended storage conditions should be reported to the Sponsor and use of the study drug 
halted until authorization for its continued use has been provided by the Sponsor or designee. 
A Sponsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, 
storage, dispensing procedures, and records. 
6.2.5. Packaging and Labeling 
ALN-AS1 Solution for Injection (SC use) is packaged in 2 mL glass vials with a fill volume of 
no less than 0.55 mL.  The container closure system consists of a Type I glass via
l, a Teflon 
faced bromobutyl 13 mm stopper and a flip-off Truedge aluminum seal. 
6.2.6. Accountability 
The Investigator or designee will maintain accurate records of receipt and the condition of the 
study drug supplied for this study, including dates of rec
eipt.  In addition, accurate records will 
be kept of when and how much study drug is dispensed and administered to each patient in the 
study.  Any reasons for departure from the protocol dispensing regimen must also be recorded. 
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of all study drugs.  All used, 
partially used, and unused study drug will be returned to the Sponsor (or designee) or destroyed 
at the clinical study center according to applicable regulations.   
6.3. Concomitant Medications 
Use of concomitant medications will be recorded on the patient’s case report form (CRF) as 
indicated in the Schedules of Assessments ( Table 1 a nd Table 2; and Table 5 a nd Table 6 in 
Appendix Section 11.2).  This includes all prescription medications, herbal preparations, over the 
counter (OTC) medications, vitamins, and minerals.  Any changes in medic
ations during the 
study will also be recorded on the CRF. 
Any concomitant medication that is required for the pa
tient’s welfare may be administered by the 
Investigator.  However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding 
the medication are recorded on the eCRF.  Concomitant medication will be coded using an 
internationally recognized and accepted coding dictionary. 
ALN-AS1 could potentially increase the clearance of drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isoform.   
Investigators will review all medications at study start and monitor response to these medications 
during the study.  For patients who require new medications while on study, selecti
on of 
medications that are not mainly metabolized by the CYP3A isoform is recommended.  A list of 
medications that are sensitive CYP3A substrates is included in Table 7 Ap pendix Section  11.3.  
In addition, a more detailed and current list of sensitive CYP3A-metabolized medications and 
CYP3A-metabolized medications with a narrow therapeutic range is availa
ble at the Indiana

Patients are not permitted to be on hemin prophylaxis at Scre
ening; however, patients are 
permitted to receive concomitant hemin treatment for the management of acute porphyria 
attacks.  Patients experiencing significant breakthrough attacks while enrolled in this study, 
necessitati ng frequent hemin treatment, may receive hemin prophylaxis if in the Investigator’s 
judgment this is clinically beneficial to the patient.  The Investigator should contact with the 
Sponsor and Medical Monitor before prophylactic hemin treatment.  The dose, regimen, and 
dates of administration will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF.   
P
ain medication (eg, opiates, opioids, narcotic analgesics) and glucose administration are 
permitted for the management of porphyria and for acute porphyria attacks. 
If patients use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications intermittently or chronically, they 
must have been able to tolerate them with no previous side effects (eg, gastric distress or 
bleeding).   
Standard vitamins and topical medications are permitted; however, topical steroids must not be 
applied anywhere near the injection site(s) unless medically indicated. 
6.4. Contraceptive Requirements 
WOCBP must be willing to use acceptable methods of contraception 14 days before first dose, 
throughout study participation, and for 90 days after last dose admi
nistration.  Birth control 
methods which may be considered as acceptable include: 
Established use of or
al, implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal methods of
contraception.  WOCBP using hormonal methods of contraception must also use a
barrier method (condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault cap] in
conjunction with spermicide [eg, foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository]).  If
hormonal methods of contraception are medically contraindicated for WOCBP due to
underlying disease, a double-barrier method (combination of male condom with
either cap, diaphragm, or sponge, in conjunction with spermicide) is also considered
an acceptable method of contraception.
Placement of an intrauterine device
Placement of an intrauterine hormone-releasing system
Bilateral tubal occlusion
Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post-vasectomy
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the
study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient)
True sexual abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
patient.  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  Abstinent
patients must agree to use 1 of the abovementioned contraceptive methods, if they
start sexual relationships during the study and for 90 days after last dose
administration.
419
ALN-AS1  Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 3_03 February 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 37 WOCBP includes any female patient who has experienced menarche and who is not 
postmenopausal or permanently sterilized (eg, bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, or 
bilateral salpingectomy).  Postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without 
an alternative medical cause, confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone level within the 
postmenopausal range. 
6.5. Treatment Compliance 
Compliance with study drug administration will be verified through observation by study 
personnel or trained home healthcare professionals.  
7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
The schedule of study assessments is provided in Table 1. 
7.1. Screening/Baseline Assessments 
Informed consent, patient demographic data, and eligibility criteria will be confirmed at 
Screening/Baseline.  An interval medical history/disease history will be obtained at 
Screening/Baseline.  The last assessments performed, determining previous study 
(ALN-AS1-001) completion, will serve as the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If 
more than 60 days have elapsed since the last assessment, clinical laboratory tests and ECGs will 
be repeated before administration of ALN-AS1. 
7.2. Clinical Activity Assessments 
The clinical activity of ALN-AS1 will be assessed by the frequency and characteristics of 
porphyria attacks including, but not limited to, duration, treatment, and severity of porphyria 
attacks and number and duration of visits to a health care setting for acute porphyria care (eg, 
hospital, emergency department, infusion center, or outpatient clinic).  Concomitant hemin 
administration will also be recorded. 
7.2.1. Patient Diary 
Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porph
yria attacks, pain 
assessments, and narcotic use. 
7.2.2.  Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form Questionnaire 
The Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) questionnaire will be used to evaluate pain.[32]  
The BPI will be completed as part of the patient diary. 
7.3. Pharmacodynamic Assessments 
Blood and urine samples will be collected for assessment of ALN-AS1 PD parameters.  The PD 
effect of ALN-AS1 will be evaluated by urine ALA and PBG levels.  Blood and urine sa
mples 
will be collected for assessment of circulating ALAS1 mRNA levels in serum and in urine.  
Analysis for blood and urine PD parameters will take place at a central laboratory.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   38 Details regarding the processing and aliquoting of samples for storage and analyses will be 
provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
7.4. Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate the PK profile of ALN-AS1 at the time points in the 
Schedule of Assessments.  A detailed schedule of time points for the collection of blood samples 
for PK analysis is in Table 4 in Appe ndix Section 11.1 ). 
The concentration of ALN-AS1 will be determined using a validated assay.  Details regarding 
the processing, shipping, 
and analysis of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
7.5. Safety Assessments 
The assessment of safety during the course of the study will consist of the surveillance and 
recording of AEs including SAEs, recording of concomitant medications and measurements of 
vital signs, physical examination, and ECG finding
s and clinical laboratory evaluations. 
Safety will be monitored over the course of the study by an SRC as described in Sec
tion 4.6. 
7.5.1. Vital Signs 
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory 
rate.  Vita
l signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be consistent for each 
patient), after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  Blood pressure should be taken 
using the same arm throughout the study.  Body temperature will be obtained in degrees Celsius, 
heart rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in beats per minute, and respiration rate 
will be counted for a full minute and recorded in breaths per minute. 
For the safety of the patient, additional vital sign assessments may be added at the discretion of 
the Investigator. 
7.5.2.  Weight and Height 
Height will be measured in centimeters at the Screening/Baseline visit only.  Body weight will be 
measured in kilograms.  Body mass index will be calculated in the database. 
7.5.3. Physical Examination 
Complete physical examinations will include the examination of the following:  gene
ral 
appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, chest/respiratory, heart/cardiovascular, 
gastrointestinal/liver, musculoskeletal/extremities, dermatological/skin, thyroid/neck, lymph 
nodes, and neurological/psychiatric. 
Targeted physical examinations will include the examination of the following:  general 
appearance, chest/respiratory, heart/cardiovascular, gastrointestinal/liver, and 
neurological/psychiatric. 
7.5.4.  Electrocardiogram 
Triplicate 12-lead ECG, with readings approximately 2 minutes apart, will be recorded.  
Additional ECGs may be collected at the discretion of the Investigator.  Standard computerized 
421
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 3_03 February 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   39 12-lead ECG recordings will be obtained.  Each lead shall be recorded for at least 3 beats at a 
speed of 25 mm/s.  Recordings will be obtained, after the pati
ent has rested comfortably for 
approximately 10 minutes.  The electrophysiologic
al parameters assessed include rhythm, 
ventricular rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, ST and T waves, Bazett-corrected QT 
interval (QTcB) and Fridericia-cor
rected QT interval (QTcF). 
The Investigator or designee is responsible for reviewing the ECGs to assess whether the results 
have changed since the Screening/Baseline visit and to determine the clinical relevance of the 
results.  These assessments will be recorded on the eCRF.  For any clinically relevant ECG 
changes from the Screening/Baseline visit (eg, ischemic ECG changes, wave/interval changes, or 
arrhythmia), the Investigator must contact the Medical Monitor to discuss continued participation 
of the patient in the study. 
7.5.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
The following clinical laboratory tests will be e
valuated by a central laboratory.   
On dosing days, results from hematology, chemistry, and coagulation tests collected within the 
prior 14 days must be reviewed by the Investigator before study drug administration. These 
results can be analyzed centrally or at a local laboratory.  If results from within the prior 14 days 
are not available at a dosing visit, locally analyzed assessments may be reviewed to allow same 
day study drug administration, but additional samples for central analysis must also be collected. 
In the event of an unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study 
drug administration, the test should be repeated and followed up at the discretion of the 
Investigator until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis is made to 
adequately explain the abnormality. 
At any point during the study, and based on Inv
estigator judgment, if a patient experiences 
uncharacteristic signs and symptoms during a porphyria attack, lipase testing should be 
performed and imaging evaluations (eg, right upper quadrant ultrasound and/or other testing, 
based on Investigator judgment) should be considered by the Investigator.  Signs and symptoms 
include, but are not limited to, uncharacteristic abdominal pain and worsening nausea and 
vomiting. 
Imaging is required for any serum lipase result of ≥3× the upper limit of normal, or as clinically 
indicated.

A pregnancy test will be performed for WOCBP only.  A serum pregnancy test will be 
performed at Screening/Baseline and urine pregnancy tests will be performed thereafter per the 
Schedule of Assessments and any time pregnancy is s
uspected.  Urine pregnancy tests may also 
be performed more frequently (eg, monthly) based on local country requirements.  The results of 
the pregnancy test must be known before study drug administration.  Patients who are pregnant 
are not eligible for study participation.  Any woman with a positive pregnancy test during the 
study will be discontinued from study drug, but will continue to be followed for safety.  Patients 
determined to be pregnant while on study will be followed until the pregnancy outcome is known 
(see Section 7.5.6.6 fo r follow-up instructions).  
7.5.6. Adverse Events 
7.5.6.1. Definitions 
Adverse Event 
According to the I
CH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 
21 Code of Federal Regulations 312.32, Investigational New Drug Safety Reporting, an AE is 
any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clini
cal investigational subject administered a 
medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening (An event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the e
vent as it occurred.  It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death) 
 Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient and may requir e 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above (eg, 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
424
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 3_03 February 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   42 room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug 
dependency or abuse). 
Adverse Event Severity 
Adverse events are
 to be graded according to the categories detailed below: 
Mild:  Mild events are those which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal 
daily activity.  
Moderate:  Moderate events are those which ca use sufficient discomfort to interfere with 
normal daily activities.  
Severe:  Severe events are those which incapacitate and prevent usual activity.  
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity.  AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of the start and stop of each incidence.  When changes in the severity of an AE 
occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day should 
be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be 
recorded separately (with distinct onset dates) 
AE severity and seriousness are assessed independently.  ‘Severity’ characterizes the intensity of 
an A E.  ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for Serious Adverse Event). 
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Treatment 
The relationship of each AE to study treatment should be evaluated by the Investigator using the 
following criteria:  
Definitely related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to the medication administration, and which 
cannot be  explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
The response to withdrawal of the drug should be clinically plausible.  
Possibly related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to the medicat ion administration, but which 
could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals.  Information on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or 
unclear.  
Unlikely related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no 
temporal relationship to medication administration, and which other 
drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations.  
Not related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality that has no 
temporal relationship to the  medication or has more likely alternative 
etiology.  
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest 
The following events are considered to be adverse events of clinical interest: 
425
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 3_03 February 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   43  ISRs 
 Hepatic AEs, including LFT abnormalities considered clinically significant by the 
Investigator . 
7.5.6.2. Eliciting and Rec
ording Adverse Events 
Eliciting Adverse Events 
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last 
visit.  The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospitalized, had any accidents, used 
any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC).  
In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant 
laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are 
relevant to patient safety. 
Recording Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for recording non-serious AEs that are observed or reported by 
the patient after administration of the first dose of study drug regardless of their relationship to 
study drug through the end of study.  Non-serious AEs w
ill be followed until the end of study.  
The Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by the patient 
after the time when the informed consent is signed regardless of their relationship to study drug 
through the end of study.  SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until baseline level 
is reached, or until the SAE is considered by the Investigator to be chronic or the patient is 
stable, as appropriate. 
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for 
the patient, whether or not they are considered to be drug-related.  Each AE must be described in 
detail:  onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to investigational drug, 
action taken, and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
For SAEs, record the event(s) on the eCRF.  If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is 
unavailable, complete the backup SAE form. 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest, additional clinical information may be 
collected based upon the severity or nature of the event. 
If a patient has ISRs meeting any of the following criteria, the Investigator or delegate should 
contact the Medical Monitor and submit a supplemental ISR eCRF: 
 ISRs that are recurrent and/or demonstrate a pattern of increasing severity 
 Any ISR that is determined to be severe and/or a cause for study drug discontinuation  

 Any ISR which, in the opinion of the Investigator, requires further medical evaluation or 
treatment 
In some cases, where
 it is medically appropriate, further evaluation may include photographs, 
referral to a dermatologist, skin biopsy, or other laboratory testing.  If a biopsy was obtained, the 
Sponsor may request that the biopsy also be reviewe
d by a central dermatopathologist.  To better 
understand the safety profile of the study drug, additional analysis of biopsy tissue may be 
performed according to local regulations. 
426
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 3_03 February 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   44 For patients with hepatic AEs, additional information, including, clinical history, course of event, 
and local laboratory results to monitor LFT levels or other laboratory parameters, may be 
collected. 
7.5.6.3. Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee 
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by the Investigator.  Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section 7.5.6.1 must  be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee within 24 hours from the time that clinical study center personne
l first 
learns of the event.  All SAEs must be reported regardless of the relationship to study drug. 
The initial report should include at least the following information: 
 Patient’ s study number 
 Description and date of onset of the event 
 Criterion for
 serious 
 Preliminary assignment of re
lationship to study dr
ug 
 Investigator/clinical study center information 
To re
port the SAE, complete the eCRF.  If the EDC system is unavail
able, complete the backup 
SAE form.  Within 24 hours of receipt of follow-up information, the Investigator must update the 
report.  SAEs must be reported using the contact information provided in the Study Manual. 
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken by the Investigator using his/her best medical 
judgment to treat the SAE.  These measures and the patient’s response to these measures should 
be recorded.  All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be followed by the 
Investigator until satisfactory resolution or the Investigator deems the SAE to be chronic or 
stable.  Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed by the Investigator as 
needed to adequately determine the etiology of the event. 
7.5.6.4. Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities 
The Sponsor or its representative is required to report certain study events in an expedited 
manner to the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency’s EudraVigilance 
electronic system according to Directive 2001/20/EC, and to all country Regulatory Authorities 
where the study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations. 
The following describes the safety reporting timeline requirements for suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) and other reportable events: 
Immediately and within 7 calendar days 
 Any suspected adverse reaction that is associated with the use of the study drug, 
une
xpected, and fatal or life threatening.  Follow-up information must be reported in 
the following 8 days. 
427
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 3_03 February 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   45 Immediately and within 15 calendar days 
 Any suspected adverse reaction that is associated with the use of the study drug, 
unexpected, and serious, but not fatal or life threatening, and there is 
evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the reaction. 
 Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggest a significant risk for human 
patients including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or 
carcinogenicity. 
 Any event in connection with the conduct of the study or the development of the 
study drug that may affect the safety of the trial pa
tients. 
In addition, periodic safety reporting to regulatory authorities will be performed by the Sponsor 
or its representative according to national and local regulations. 
7.5.6.5. Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
SUSARs will be reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) per their institutional policy by the Investigator or Sponsor (or Sponsor 
designee) according to country requirements.  Copies of each report and documentation of 
IRB/IEC notification and acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator’s study 
file. 
7.5.6.6. Pregnancy Reporting 
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the course of this study through 90 days following 
the last dose of study drug, the Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee 
within 24 hours of being notified of the pregnancy.  Details of the pregnancy will be recorded on 
the pregnancy reporting form.  The patient should rece
ive any necessary counseling regarding 
the risks of continuing the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. 
The pregnancy should be followed by the Investigator until completion.  At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy.  If the outcome of the 
pregnancy results in a postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
or congenital anomaly, then the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE 
as outlined in Section 7.5.6.3 .   
7.5.6.7. Over
dose Reporting 
An overdose is defined as any dose administered to or taken by a patient (accidentally or 
intentionally) that exceeds the highest daily dose, or is at a higher frequency, than included in the 
protocol.  It is up to the investigator to decide whether a dose is to be considered an overdose, in 
consultation with the Sponsor.  Overdose must be recorded in the eCRF. 
All reports of overdose (with or without an AE) must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor 
or designee.

Blood and urine samples will be collected for exploratory analyses.  Aliquots of samples will be 
obtained and frozen, to permit future analysis of the effect of ALN-AS1 on exploratory 
biomarkers.   
Where local regulations allow, biologic samples will be r
etained on behalf of the Sponsor for a 
maximum of 15 years following the last patient’s last visit in the study.  Details regarding the 
collection, processing, storage, and shipping of samples will be in the Laboratory Manual. 
7.7. Other Assessments 
7.7.1. EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire 
QOL will be assessed through the use of the 5-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L), a standardized 
questionnaire measuring health outcomes.[ 34]  In addition to the time points indicated, the 
EQ-5D-5L questionna
ire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a 
porphyria att
ack (but, not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible. 
8. STATISTICS 
A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written after finalizing the protocol and before 
database lock.  The plan will detail the implementation of all the statistical analyses in

ALN-AS1      Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 3_03 February 2017  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential      58 b After a patient has completed 6 months of ALN-AS1 administration in this study, and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, 
study procedures, including ALN-AS1 administration, may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional.  Study procedures may occur at the 
patient’s home at the discretion of the Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical 
study center Q3M through M12, and thereafter Q6M. Additional visits to collect clinical laboratory samples may occur at home at any point during the 
treatment period, within 14 days prior to scheduled dose administration. 
c See Section  7.1 for details on the interval medical history/disease history to be recorded at Screening/Baseline.  Ongoing AEs from the previous study 
(ALN-AS1-001) will be captured as medical history. 
d A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening/Baseline, and D1.  At all other visits, a targeted physical examination will be performed.  On 
dosing days, the physical examination will be performed predose.  On days when ALN-AS1 is not administered, the physical examination can occur at any time 
during the visit.  See Section  7.5.3  for details on the physical examination. 
e Height will be measured at Screening/Baseline only. 
f Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate.  On D1, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose; and 2 hours 
(±10 minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose.  On days when ALN-AS1 is not administered, vital signs 
can be collected at any time during the visit.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be consistent for each patient), after the 
patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes. 
g Triplicate 12-lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine position after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  On D1, ECGs will be 
performed within 1 hour predose and 2 hours (±10 minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, ECGs will be collected within 1 hour predos e. 
h Clinical laboratory parameters are described in Section  7.5.5 .  On dosing days, blood samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected predose.  On 
days when ALN-AS1 is not administered, blood samples can be collected at any time during the visit. On dosing days, results from hematology, chemistry 
(including LFTs), and coagulation tests collected within the prior 14 days must be reviewed by the Investigator before study drug administration.  If results 
from within the prior 14 days are not available at a dosing visit, locally analyzed predose assessments may be used for review in order to allow same day study 
drug administration, but additional samples for central analysis must also be collected. 
i A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening/Baseline; thereafter, urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  Results must be available before dosing. 
j ALN-AS1 will be administered by SC injection according to the Pharmacy Manual.  See Section  6.2.2  for ALN-AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  For weight-
based dosing, weight measured on the dosing day will be used to calculate the dose of ALN-AS1.  After M12, weight measured on the nearest previous visit 
will be used to calculate the weight-based dose of ALN-AS1. 
k Spot urine samples will be collected for measurement of ALA, PBG, and creatinine levels.  On dosing days, samples should be collected predose. 
l On dosing days, blood and urine samples for ALAS1 mRNA (and possible biomarker) analysis will be collected within 1 hour predose. 
m Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points listed in  Table 4  (Appendix Section 11.1). 
n On dosing days, blood samples for antidrug antibody analysis should be collected within 1 hour predose. 
o Porphyria attack laboratory sample collection kits should be dispensed at the screening visit along with instructions for use. For any attack that occurs through 
M39, urine samples should be collected within 24 hours of the start of clinical intervention (eg, hemin or glucose administration) and within 24 hours of the end 
of clinical intervention.  If patients are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laboratory sample collection kits should be used 
for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center, if possible.  These urine samples may also be analyzed for exploratory biomarkers. 
p In addition to the time points indicated, the EQ- 5D-5L questionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a porphyria attack 
(but not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible.  
q Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain assessments, and narcotic use on a daily basis through M9; 
thereafter, acute porphyria attacks will be recorded in the diary.  The BPI will be completed on a weekly basis as part of the patient diary through M9, then 
Q3M.

ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
 Amendment 3 Summary of Changes_ 03 February 2017 
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 1 ALN-AS1-002 Protocol Amendment 3 
Summary of Changes (dated 03 February 2017)  
compared to Protocol Amendment 2 (d
ated 01 December 2016) 
A Multicenter, Open-label Extension Study to Evaluate the Long-term Safety and Clinical 
Activity of Subcutaneously Administered ALN AS1 in Patients with Acute Intermittent 
Porphyria who have Completed a Previous Clinical Study with ALN-AS1 
 
Rationale for Protocol Amendment 
The purpose of this amendment is to update the risk-benefit assessment of the study protocol to 
align with the current Investigator's Broc
hure, to add regular monitoring of prothrombin time 
(PT), International Normalized Ratio (INR), and c-reactive protein (CRP), and to clarify the 
timing of the review of clinical laboratory asse
ssments prior to scheduled dosing. 
This amendment includes the following changes: 
 Updated dose rationale and risk-benefit sections to align with current IB including 
pre
liminary clinical results from Part C of Study ALN-AS1-001 and nonclinical findings 
from the rat and NHP chronic toxicology studies  
 Added assessments of PT , I NR and CRP to regularly scheduled clinical laboratory draws 
 Clarified that hematology, chemistry (including LFTs), and coagulation results must be 
reviewed prior to each dose, and that the interval between the blood sample coll
ection 
and dosing should not exceed 14 days 
A detailed summary of the changes is provided in Table 1.  Corrections to typographical errors 
and formatting are not detailed.

ALN-AS1 Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
 Amendment 3 Summary of Changes_ 03 February 2017 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 2 Table 1: Protocol Amendment 3 Detailed Summary of Changes 
The primary section(s) of the protocol affected by the changes in the protocol amendment are indicated.  The corresponding text has 
been revised throughout the protocol.  Deleted text is indicated by strikeout; added text is indicated by bold  font. 
Purpose : To update the benefit -risk assessme nt with recent nonclinical and clinical data  
The primary change occurs in Section 1. 7 Benefit -Risk Assessment  
Added text:  Patients participating in this study may experience a reduced number or severity of porphyria attacks, reduced 
treatment with IV hemin, and/or reduced requirement for pain medication.  As presented in Section  1.6, emerging 
data  demonstrate that patients given ALN -AS1 experienced reduced ALA/PBG levels, decreased attack 
frequency and reduced heme usage in the 24 -week treatment period compared to the 12 -week run -in period 
in Study ALN -AS1-001 
As detailed in Section  1.6, a fatal SAE of hemorrhagic pancreatitis was reported but deemed to be unlikely 
related to study drug.  However, the potentially non -adverse nonclinical findings of angiectasis in the islets 
of Langerhans (endocrine, not exocrine region) of the rat pancreas (see Investigator’s Brochure), do not 
exclude a potential association between A LN-AS1 and the SAE of hemorrhagic pancreatitis.  
Purpose: To clarifiy procedures on predose clinical laboratory review  
The primary change occurs in Section 7.5.5 Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Now reads : Results On dosing days, results  from clinical laboratory hematology, chemistry, and coagulation  tests collected 
on dosing days are not required before study drug administration; however if results for clinical laboratory tests 
from within  the previous study visit are not available or are deemed clinica lly significant, then clinical laboratory 
assessments  prior 14 days  must be repeated and the results must be deemed acceptable  reviewed  by the 
Investigator before study drug administration. These results can be analyzed centrally or at a local laboratory.  
If results from within the prior 14 days are not available at a dosing visit, locally analyzed assessments may 
be reviewed to allow same day study drug administration, but additional samples for central analysis must 
also be collected.

Study Design  
This is a multicenter, open -label extension study to evaluate the long- term safety and clinical activity 
of ALN-AS1 in patients with AIP who completed study ALN- AS1-001. 
The last assessments performed, determining previous study (ALN -AS1-001) completion, will serve as 
the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed since the last 
assessment, safety assessments will be repeated before admin istration of ALN -AS1.  It is anticipated 
that patients will begin ALN -AS1 administration in this study within 6 months after the last dose of 
study drug in the previous study.  Eligibility will be confirmed before administration of the first dose of 
ALN -AS1 (Day 1).  Patients will undergo assessments at the clinical study center every month for the 
first 3 months.  Then, through Month 6, and according to the dosing regimen selected, assessments will take place at the clinical study center or via a phone contact (for an every month dosing regimen, visits will be every month; for an every 3 months dosing regimen, visits will be every 3 months).  A fter a 
patient has completed 6 months of ALN-AS1 administration in this study  (6 months in an every month dosing regimen), and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, study 
visits and ALN -AS1 administration may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional.  
Home visits may occur at the discretion of the Investigator, b ased on safety and tolerability; however, 
patients are required to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical study center every 3 months for the first year, and thereafter every 6 months through the end of the treatment period.  Patients will return to the 
clinical study center for a posttreatment follow-up visit after administration of the last dose of 
ALN -
AS1.  An ALA/PBG Monitoring/EOS visit will be conducted either at the clinical study center or 
via phone contact, unless treatment continues with ALN- AS1. 
Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain assessments, and narcotic use.  Patients will also be provided with laboratory sample collection kits and instructions 
for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center.  
A Safety Review Committee  (SRC)  will review safety and tolerability data collected during the study 
with the primary purpose of protecting the safety of patients participating in the study. 
Number of Planned Patients  
Up to 24 patients are planned for enrollment in this study (including optional cohorts in ALN -AS1-001). 
Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria  
Patients with AIP, who have completed Part C of study ALN- AS1-001, will be eligible for screening in 
this study.  Eligible patients will not be on a scheduled regimen of hemin to prevent porphyria attacks at Screening.  Patients with alanine transaminase ≥2.0× upper limit of normal, total bilirubin ≥2 mg/dL 
(unless bilirubin elevation is due to Gilbert’s syndrome), or estimated glomerular filtration rate 
≤30 mL/min/1.73 m
2 (using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) at Screening are not 
eligib le for this study.  
Investigational Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
ALN -AS1 Solution for Injection (subcutaneous use [SC]) is comprised of a synthetic, small interfering 
RNA targeting ALAS1 and bearing a triantennary N- acetyl galactosamine ligand  conjugated to the 
sense strand, formulated in phosphate buffer.   
The study starting dose and regimen of ALN- AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg as an SC injection administered every 
3 months.  Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may approve changes to the dosing regimen, 
including decreases in the dose level and changes in the dosing frequency .  However  any dose and 
dosing regimen will not exceed a previously explored dose level or frequency  that was determined to 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  5 
455
ALN -AS1  Clinical Study Pr otocol ALN -AS1-002 
Amendment 2_ 01 December  2016 
 
be safe and well -tolerated in study ALN -AS1-001, SRC, Health Authority  and Ethics Committee 
approval must be sought prior to dose escalation above 5.0 mg/kg in accordance with local Regulatory 
requirements .  
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Not applicable  
Duration of Treatment and Study  
The duration of treatment is up to 36 months.  The estimated total time on study, inclusive of 
Screening/Baseline, for each patient is up to 44 months. 
Statistical Methods  
Statistical analyses will be primarily descriptive.  Incidence of AEs will be summarized by maximum 
severity and relationship to ALN- AS1.  Incidence of and serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs 
leading to discontinuation will also be tabulated.  By-patient listings will be provided for deaths, SAEs, 
and events leading to discontinuation.  
Laboratory shift tables from baseline to worst values will be presented.  Abnormal physical examination findings and electrocardiogram data will be presented in by -patient listings.  Descriptive 
statistics will be provided for electrocardiogram interval data and presented as both actual values and 
changes from baseline relative to each on study evaluation and to the last evaluation on-study. 
Clinical activity of ALN -AS1 will be summarized primarily by descriptive statistics.  The clinical 
activity of  ALN- AS1 will be evaluated by the frequency and characteristics of porphyria attacks 
including duration, treatment, and severity of porphyria attacks and number and duration of visits to a 
health care setting for acute porphyria care.  Patient diary record ings, including BPI-SF questionnaire 
scores, will also be summarized.   
PD analysis will include the evaluation of change in ALA, PBG, and ALAS mRNA levels.  Descriptive 
statistics (eg, mean and standard error of the mean) for observed levels of PD parameters and the 
relative change from baseline will be presented for each of the postdose follow -up time points. 
The PK concentration of ALN-AS1 will be determined.  Antidrug antibody results will be tabulated 
overall and by previous treatment in the previous study (ALN- AS1-001).  A by- patient listing will also 
be provided. 
Additional exploratory analyses may be conducted on analytes related to targeting the heme 
biosynthesis pathway.  Quality of life scores will also be summarized.

Amendment 2_ 01 December  2016 
b After a patient has completed 12 months of ALN -AS1 administration in this study, and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, 
study visits and ALN -AS1 administration may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional.  Home visits may occur at the discretion of the 
Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical s tudy center Q6M.  
c See Section  7.1 for details on the interval medical history/disease history to be recorded at Screening/Baseline.  Ongoing AEs from the previ ous study 
(ALN -AS1-001) will be capt ured as medical history.  
d A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening/Baseline, and D1.  At all other visits, a targeted physical ex amination will be performed.  On 
dosing days, the physical examination will be performed predose.  On da ys when ALN -AS1 is not administered, the physical examination can occur at any time 
during the visit.  See Section  7.5.3  for details on the physical examination.  
e Height will be measured at Screening/Baseline only.  
f Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate.  On D1, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose; and 2  hours 
(±10  minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, vital signs 
can be collected at any time d uring the visit.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be consistent for each patient), afte r the 
patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  
g Triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine position a fter the patient has rested comfortably for 10  minutes.  On D1, ECGs will be 
performed within 1 hour predose and 2 hours (±10 minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, ECGs will be collected within 1 hour predose.  
h Clinical laboratory parameters are described in Section  7.5.5 .  On dosing days, blood samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected within 1 hour 
predose .  Results from clinical laboratory tests collected on dosing days are not required before study drug administration; however, i f results for clinical 
laboratory tests from the previous study visit are not available or are deemed clinically significant, then clinical laboratory assessments must be repeated and 
the results must be deemed acceptable by the Investigator before study drug administration.   On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, blood samples can 
be collected at any tim e during the visit.  
i A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening/Baseline; thereafter, urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  Results  must be available before dosing.  
j ALN -AS1 will be administered by SC injection according to the Pharmacy Manual.  See Section  6.2.2  for ALN -AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  For 
weight -based dosing, weight measured on the dosing day will be used to calculate the dose of ALN -AS1.  After M12, weight measured on the nearest previous 
visit will be used to calculate the weight -based dose of ALN -AS1.  
k Spot urine samples will be collected for measurement of ALA, PBG, and creatinine levels.  On dosing days, samples should be collected predose.  
l On dosing days, blood and urine samples for ALAS1 mRNA (and possible biomarker) analysis will be collected within 1 hour predose.  
m Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points listed in  Table  3 (Appendix Section  11.1).  
n On dosing days, blood samples for antidrug antibody analysis should be collected within 1 hour predose.  
o Porphyria attack laboratory sample collection kits should be dispensed at the scr eening visit along with instructions for use. For any attack that occurs through 
M39, u rine samples should be collected within 24 hours of the start of clinical intervention (eg, hemin or glucose administration) and within 24  hours of the end 
of clinical intervention.  If patients are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laboratory sample collection kits will be provided that contain instructions for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center, if po ssible.  These urine samples may also be analyzed for 
exploratory biomarkers.  
p In addition to the time points indicated, the EQ -5D-5L questionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a porphyria attack 
(but not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible.  
q Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain assessments, and narcotic use on  a daily basis through M9; 
thereafter, acute porphyria attacks will be recorded in the diary.  The BPI will be completed on a weekly basis as part of the patient diary through M9, then Q3M.  
r Patients will be contacted by phone to collect AEs and concomitant medications.  Patients will also be reminded to collect an d send urine samples to th e clinical 
study center, if possible, if they are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack.

Amendment 2_ 01 December  2016 
a Where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, study visits and ALN -AS1 administration may take place at the patient’s home by a 
healthcare professional.  Home visits may occur at the discretion of the Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to complete 
at least 1 visit at the clinical study center Q6M.  
b Patients who discontinue trea tment will be asked to complete the M39 visit assessments.  If a patient chooses to withdraw from the study, every effort should 
be made to conduct early the assessments performed at the M39 visit.  See Section  5.3 for details on removal from treatment or assessment.  
c The ALA/PBG Monitoring/EOS visit will be conducted at the clinical study center or via phone contact, unless treatment contin ues with ALN -AS1.  Patients 
will be provided with laboratory sample collection kits and instructions for collecting and sending urine samples to the clin ical study center . 
d A complete physical examination will be performed at the posttreatment follow -up visit.  At  all other visits, a targeted physical examination will be performed.  
On dosing days, the physical examination will be performed predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, the physical examination can occur at any 
time during the visit.  See Sect ion 7.5.3  for details on the physical examination.  
e Height will be measured at Screening/Baseline only.  
f Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate.  On a dosing days, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose.  On 
days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, vital signs can be collected at any time during the visit.  Vital signs will be measured in the  seated or supine position 
(should be consistent for each patient), after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  
g Triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine position after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minute s.  On dosing days, ECGs will 
be collected within 1 hour predose.  
h Clinical laboratory parameters are described in Section  7.5.5 .  On dosing days, b lood samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected within 1 hour 
predose .  Results from clinical laboratory tests collected on dosing days are not required before study drug administration; however, i f results for clinical 
laboratory tests from the previous study visit are not available or are deemed clinically significant, then clinical laboratory assessments must be repeated and the results must be deemed acceptable by the Investigator before study d rug administration.   On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, blood samples can 
be collected at any time during the visit.  
i Urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  Results must be available before dosing.  
j ALN -AS1 will be administered by SC injection according to the Pharmacy Manual.  See Section  6.2.2  for ALN -AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  Weight 
measured on the nearest previous visit will be used to calculate the weight -based dose of ALN -AS1.  
k Spot urine samples will be collected for measurement of ALA, PBG, and creatinine levels.  On dosing days, samples should be collected predose.  
l On dosing days, blood and urine samples for ALAS1 mRNA (and possible biomarker) analysis will be collected within 1 hour predose.  
m Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points listed in  Table  3 (Appendix Section  11.1).  
n On dosing days, blood samples for antidrug antibody analysis should be collected within 1 hour predose.  
o In addi tion to the time points indicated, the EQ -5D-5L questionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a porphyria attack 
(but, not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible.  
p Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks.  The BPI will be completed as part of the patient diary Q3M.  
q Patients will be contacted by phone to collect AEs and co ncomitant medications.  Patients will also be reminded to collect and send urine samples to the clinical 
study center, if possible, if they are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack.

Amendment 2_ 01 December  2016 
1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Disease Overview 
The porphyrias are a family of rare metabolic disorders predominately caused by a genetic 
mutation in 1 of the 8 enzymes responsible for heme synthesis.[ 1]  The 2 major categories are 
erythropoietic and hepatic, depending on the major site of expression of the underlying enzyme 
deficiency .[2]  In addition, the porphyrias are classified as acute if patients present with 
neurovisceral symptoms (eg, abdominal pain and neurologic symptoms) or cutaneous if they 
present with dermal blistering or photosensitivity. [3, 4]   
This study will include patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), the most common acute 
hepatic porphyria (AHP).  AIP occurs as a result of an autosomal dominant mutation leading to partial deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), the third enzyme in the heme 
biosynthesis pathway .[5]  The rate limiting step in heme synthesis is the upstream enzyme 
5-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1), which is controlled by feedback repression via the 
end-product heme.  In response to a decrease in endogenous heme in the liver, as can occur with 
fasting, hormonal alterations, or with cytochrome P450 (CYP) inducing drugs, ALAS1 is induced, resulting in increased flux through the heme synthesis pathway.  In patients with AIP, this can result in the marked accumulation of the toxic heme intermediates porphobilinogen 
(PBG) and delta aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in the blood and urine due to the deficiency in the 
downstream PBGD.  Clinically, this manifests as acute attacks characterized by severe 
abdominal pain, cardiovascular as well as neurologic and psychiatric dysfunction.[ 6] 
1.1.1. Epidemiology 
Over 370 mutations have been identified in the PBGD gene, which in most instances result in its reduction by approximately 50%.  The exact prevalence of AIP is unknown due to under diagnosis, variation by geographic region, and the differences in penetrance observed for the 
different mutations .[2]  However, it is estimated that the prevalence of AIP is 5 to 10 per 
100,000 people in Western countries, while in Sweden it occurs in 1 in 1,000 people due to a 
founder effect associated with the resultant G593A mutation.[ 7-10]   AIP shows incomplete 
penetrance and on average only 10% to 50% of carriers with a mutation present with clinical symptoms. [11]  It has been proposed that unknown inherited co-factors, in addition to PBGD 
mutations, may explain why a small percentage of patients present with much more severe 
disease while the majority remain asymptomatic.  
Patients with AIP present with acute attacks characterized by neurovisceral symptoms and signs 
including severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or less commonly diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, fever, muscle weakness, as well as neurological (eg, neuropathy, seizures) and psychiatric (eg, anxiety and confus ion) manifestations .[12]  AIP attacks typically 
start after puberty and can be triggered by exogenous factors such as medications (especially barbiturates, sulfonamides, and hydantoins), stress, exogenous hormones, nutritional status, and infection.  Clinically active disease is more common in women, where attacks often occur around the menstrual cycle and are likely precipitated by hormonal changes.  
Many AIP patients remain undiagnosed given that the disease is rare and characterized by 
non-specific symptoms (eg, abdominal pain and nausea).[ 2]  The initial diagnosis involves

470
ALN -AS1   Clinical Study  Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
Amendment 2_ 01 December  2016 
demonstrating elevated urinary PBG (typically 20 -50 × normal reference range) and ALA 
(typically 5-20 × normal reference range) when the patient is having acute attack symptoms.  
Once a test is positive for elevated ALA and PBG and porphyria is suspected, genetic testing for 
a PBGD mutation is performed.   
There are 4 main clinical phenotypes of AIP.  Latent gene carriers have never had an acute attack 
and are biochemically inactive (normal urinary ALA and PBG).  Asymptomatic high excreters 
(ASHE) do not have current acute attacks, but are biochemically active (increased urinary ALA and PBG).  The incr eased levels of ALA and PBG in ASHE patients are lower than those in AIP 
patients during an acute attack, but are still significantly higher than normal reference values.[ 6-
8]  Sporadic attack patients have infrequent acute attacks.  Recurrent attack patients have 
≥4 attacks per year requiring hospitalization or treatment by a medical professional. [7] 
1.1.2. Current Management and Unmet Medical Need  
Management of acute attacks often requires hospitalizati on.  Patients are initially treated with 
supportive care and carbohydrate loading, analgesics and anti-emetics, and removal of known 
precipitating factors. [13]  In patients with moderate to severe attacks, or who f ail to respond to 
supportive measures, treatment with intravenous (IV) hemin (daily for 3-5 days) is commenced.  
Symptoms typically begin to improve after 2 to 5 days of hemin treatment, accompanied by a 
lowering of urinary ALA and PBG levels to below or a t the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
reference value; however, in some patients attacks can last several weeks, requiring prolonged 
hemin use and hospitalization.[ 14]  With prolonged and severe attacks, cranial nerve 
involvement can occur, leading to bulbar paralysis, respiratory failure, and death.[ 15]  
Hemin, a blood derived therapy, was approved as Normosang
® (heme arginate) in the European  
Union (EU) and as Panhematin® (lyophilised hematin) in the United States (US) in 1999 and 
1983, respectively.[ 16, 17]   In the EU, heme arginate is indicated for the treatment of acute 
attacks of hepatic por phyria (eg, AIP, variegate porphyria, and hereditary coproporphyria); 
whereas, in the US lyophilized hemin is limited to the amelioration of recurrent attacks of AIP 
temporally related to the menstrual cycle.  Approval of both products was based on biochem ical 
efficacy (ie, lowering of ALA and PBG) as well as data from uncontrolled case series and case 
reports .[18-22]   Hemin side effects include thrombophlebitis, transient anticoagulation, and in 
rare cases, anaphylaxis or renal failure.[ 22-24]   In addition, hemin administration requires a large 
vein for administration, often necessitating central venous access. 
While the majority of patients who experience attacks have them sporadically, it is estimated that 
up to 1,000 AIP patients experience recurrent attacks (typically defined as ≥4 per year) in the US 
and EU combined.[ 25]  While hemin is currently only approved to ameliorate acute attacks, it is 
administered prophylactically in some patients with recurrent attacks (eg, administered every 
1-2 weeks). [26]  Potential problems associated with chronic hemin administration include 
infusion site phlebitis, iron overload, and the need for chronic IV access and associated 
complications (eg, risk of infection or occlusion).[ 5]  In addition, there have been reports of a 
decrease in efficacy with chronic hemin administration, as evidenced by the need to increase the frequency or dosage of hemin prophylaxis over time in attempt to maintain a clinical effect. [27]  
In patients with very severe recurrent attacks, or in whom hemin treatment is not effective, liver 
transplantati
on can be curative; however, organ transplantation is a high -risk procedure and is 
rarely used as a treatment option [34].   Given the significant morbidity and mortality, there

ALN -AS1   Clinical Study  Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
Amendment 2_ 01 December  2016 
remains a significant unmet need for an efficacious, simple, fast -acting and better tolerated 
treatment for acute or prevent recurrent attacks in patients with AIP.  
1.2. RNA Interference  
RNA interference (RNAi) is a naturally occurring cellular mechanism mediated by small 
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for regulating gene expression.  Typically, synthetic siRNAs are 19 to 25 base pair double stranded oligonucleotides in a staggered duplex with a 2-nucleotide 
overhang at both or 1 of the 3’ ends .[28]  Such siRNAs can be d esigned to target an endogenous 
messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript of a given gene.  When introduced into cells, the net effect 
of an RNAi -based pharmacological approach is the binding of the siRNA to its complementary 
mRNA sequence, cleavage of this target m RNA, and reduction of synthesis of the target protein, 
resulting in a decrease of the target protein levels. [29]  The ability to selectively and potently 
degrade the mRNA encoding the ALAS1 protein (thereby decreasing accumulation of the toxic 
intermediates ALA and PBG) using an siRNA is a novel approach for the prevention and 
treatment of acute attacks in patients with AIP.   
1.3. ALN-AS1  
ALN -AS1 comprises a synthetic siRNA covalently linked to a GalNAc containing ligand 
(ALN60519), specific for ALAS1 and formulated for administration via subcutaneous (SC) injection. ALN-60519 has a target region between nucleotide 918 to 937 of the ALAS1 mRNA. 
Attachment to a triantennary GalNAc ligand to the siRNA enables its distribution to the liver (which is the primary site of ALAS1 synthesis), followed by intracellular delivery to hepatocytes 
via ASGPR, resulting in engagement of the RNAi pathway and suppression of hepatic ALAS1 
protein synthesis. 
ALN -AS1 is currently in development for treatment of acute attacks in patients with AIP, the 
most common AHP. Further information on ALN-AS1, including the clinical and nonclinical experience to date, is 
available in in the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
1.4. Study Desi gn Rationale  
This is a multicenter, open -label extension study designed to evaluate the long- term safety and 
clinical activity of subcutaneously administered ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP who have 
completed clinical study ALN -AS1-001.  The primary endpoint for the study is the incidence of 
AEs.  
1.5. Dose Rationale  
Clinical data from Part A and Part B of the ongoing study ALN -AS1-001 demonstrate that single 
(0.035-2.5 mg/kg) and multiple (0.35-1.0 mg/kg) doses of ALN- AS1 have been generally 
well-tolerated in patie nts with AIP who are ASHE.  Additionally, data from this study indicate 
that a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1 results in near normalization of urine ALA and PBG 
levels, which is sustained for approximately 14 weeks.   
Patients in Part C of the ongoing st udy ALN -AS1-001 who are eligible for participation in this 
study will likely require a higher dose of ALN -AS1 to normalize ALA and PBG as they have 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential    22 
472
ALN -AS1   Clinical Study  Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
Amendment 2_ 01 December  2016 
higher levels of ALAS1 upregulation and higher baseline levels of ALA and PBG, when 
compared to patients wit h AIP who are ASHE. [30]  For example, based on preliminary data in 
Part A and Part B of the ALN -AS1-001 study, the mean PBG level of patients who are ASHE is 
21.9 mmol/mol Cr (N=28); whereas, in Part C of this study in patients with AHP who have recurrent porphyria attacks, the mean PBG level is approximately 49.3 mmol/mol Cr (N=12).  
The study starting dose and regimen of ALN -AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg a s an SC injection administered 
every 3  months.  Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may approve changes to the 
ALN -AS1 dosing regimen, including decreases in the dose level and changes in dosing 
frequency.  However, any dosing regimen will not exceed a previously explored dose level or 
frequency  that was determined to be safe and well -tolerated in study ALN -AS1-001. SRC, 
Health Authority and Ethics Committee approval must be sought prior to dose level escalation 
above 5.0 mg/kg in accordance with local  Regulatory requirements . 
The study starting dose and regimen was selected based on the benefit:risk profile of ALN- AS1 
in Part C of the ongoing ALN- AS1-001 study.  Preliminary data to date indicate that 
administration of 5.0 mg/kg ALN-AS1 has been generally well -tolerated.  There have been no 
study drug- related SAEs, severe AEs, or clinically significant changes in safety parameters.  
While a single 2.5 mg/kg dose of ALN- AS1 has also been generally well -tolerated when 
administered to patients in Par t A and Part C  of study ALN- AS1-001, this dose has not resulted 
in near normalization of ALA and PBG levels.  In addition, while emerging data from Part C 
indicate that an every 3 months dose of 2.5 mg/kg ALN- AS1 demonstrated some clinical activity 
(eg, de crease in attack frequency and decrease in heme use), some patients continued to 
experience breakthrough porphyria attacks during the treatment period, indicating that a higher dose may be required. 
The duration of dosing in this study is supported by the overall favorable safety profile of 
ALN -AS1 in the ongoing clinical study ALN- AS1-001 and the absence of new findings in 
nonclinical studies with ALN -AS1.  
1.6. Benefit-Risk Assessment  
Patients participating in this study may experience a reduced number or severity of porphyria attacks, reduced treatment with IV hemin, and/or reduced requirement for pain medication.  
The potential risks associated with administration of ALN -AS1 in patient s with AIP are as 
follows: 
• Injection site reactions (ISRs):  ALN -AS1 is administered by SC injection.  In the 
ongoing ALN-AS1 clinical study, AEs of ISRs have been infrequently reported and have been mild to moderate in severity with single dosing.  Injection site rotation and close monitoring have been implemented in ALN- AS1 clinical studies to reduce the 
potential for ISRs.  
• Liver function test abnormalities:  As ALN -AS1 is targeted for delivery to the liver, 
and reversible hepatic changes were observed i n some animal species, there is a 
potential for development of LFT abnormalities.  To minimize the potential for LFT 
abnormalities, patients are required to have adequate liver function at study entry and 
LFTs are monitored during the study.

Amendment 2_ 01 December  2016 
• Reproductive health:  No data are available on the use of ALN -AS1 in pregnancy; 
however, there is no suspicion of human teratogenicity based on class effects or 
genotoxic potential.  ALN-AS1 was neither genotoxic nor clastogenic in in vitro and in vivo studies.  Based o n preliminary data from rat fertility/embryofetal development 
and rabbit embryofetal development studies, it is unlikely that ALN- AS1 
administration to pregnant women poses a risk to embryofetal development.  In a rat fertility/embryofetal development stud y at daily dose levels up to 16.5 mg/kg, no test 
article -related effects on female fertility or developmental endpoints were observed.  
In a rabbit embryofetal development study, maternal toxicity was observed at daily doses of >3 mg/kg (7.8 -fold higher than the clinical monthly dose of 5.0 mg/kg).  No 
terata were observed in this range finding embryo fetal development study.  Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test, cannot be breastfeeding, and must be willing to use acceptable methods of contraception during 
studies with ALN -AS1.  
• CYP inhibition:  A study in NHP demonstrated that ALN-AS1 dosing could potentially increase the clearance of drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isoform.  As 
contraceptive hormones are metabolized via CYP3A, WOCBP must use a barrier 
method of contraception, in addition to hormonal contraception, during study 
participation.  Additionally, Investigators will review all patient medications at study start and monitor responses to these medications during the study.  A list of 
medications that are sensitive CYP3A substrates is in  Table 6 in Appendix 
Section  11.3.   In addition, a list of medications that are sensitive CYP3A substrates is 
available at the Indiana University, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, website. [31] 
The complete summary of  the clinical and nonclinical data relevant to the investigational drug 
and its study in human subjects is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.

4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.1. Summary of Study Design  
This is a Phase 1/2 multicenter, open -label extension study to evaluate the long -term safety and 
clinical activity of ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP who completed study ALN- AS1-001.  The 
study will be conducted at up to 8 clinical study centers worldwide.  
The last assessments performed, determining previous study (ALN- AS1-001) completion, will 
serve as the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed 
since the last assessment, safety assessments (eg, ECG and clinical laboratory tests) will be 
repeated befor e administration of ALN -AS1.  It is anticipated that patients will begin ALN -AS1 
administration in this study within 6 months after the last dose of study drug in the previous 
study.  Eligibility will be confirmed during Screening/Baseline and before admin istration of the 
first dose of ALN -AS1 (Day 1 ).  Patients will undergo assessments at the clinical study center 
every month for the first 3 months.  Then, through Month 6, and according to the dosing regimen selected, assessments will take place at the cli nical study center or via a phone contact (for an 
every month dosing regimen, visits will be every month; for an every 3 months dosing regimen, visits will be every 3 months; see Section  6.2.2).  After a patient has completed 12  months of 
ALN -AS1 administration in this study (6 months in an every month dosing regimen), and where 
applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, study visits and ALN- AS1 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential    25

ALN -AS1   Clinical Study  Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
Amendment 2_ 01 December  2016 
administration may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional (as indicated in 
the Schedules of Assessments in  Table 1 and T able 2;  and Table 4 and Table 5 in Appendix 
Section  11.2) .  Home visits may occur at the discretion of the Investigator, based on safety and 
tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical study center 
every 3  months for the first year, and thereafter every 6 months through the end of the treatment 
period.  Patients will return to the clinical study center for a posttreatment follow -up visit after 
administration of the last dose of ALN- AS1.   An ALA/PBG Monitoring/EOS visit will be 
conducted either at the clinical study center or via phone contact, unless treatment continues with 
ALN -AS1.  
Patients or c aregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain 
assessments, and narcotic use.  Additionally, patients will be encouraged to report to the clinical study center if they experience a porphyria attack through Month 39.  In the event that patients 
are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laboratory sample collection kits containing instructions for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical 
study center, if possible, will be provided.  Patients will be contacted by phone after a porphyria 
attack to record attack details.  If patients are experiencing signs and symptoms of a porphyria attack when ALN -AS1 administration is scheduled, the Investigator will determine whether 
administratio n of ALN- AS1 is appropriate.  If patients are treated for a porphyria attack at a 
health care facility (eg, hospital, emergency department, infusion center, or outpatient clinic) other than the clinical study center, copies of medical records, including di scharge summaries, 
will be requested.   
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review safety and tolerability data collected during the 
study with the primary purpose of protecting the safety of patients participating in the study (see 
Section  4.6).

4.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups 
This is an open- label study; all patients will receive ALN -AS1.  A combination of the clinical 
study center number and screening number will create the unique patient identifier.  The cl inical 
study center number will be assigned by the Sponsor.  Upon signing the Informed Consent Form 
(ICF), the patient will be assigned a screening number by the clinical study site, which will be the same unique patient identifier assigned in the previous study (ALN -AS1-001).  The 
Investigator, or delegate, will confirm that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.  
4.5. Blinding  
This is an open- label study, and all patients will receive ALN -AS1.  
4.6. Safety Review Committee  
An SRC will be involved in the conduct of this study.  The SRC has the responsibility for 
monitoring the safety of the study participants.  The SRC will perform periodic reviews of safety 
and tolerability data during the course of the clinical study at le ast every 3 months for the first 
6 months of the study and thereafter at least every 6 months.  The SRC may also meet on an ad 
hoc basis for review of emergent safety and tolerability data, as defined in the SRC Charter for 
this clinical study.  The SRC will not stop the study for efficacy.  
The SRC will be comprised of the following members:  Principal Investigator(s), or designee(s), 
the Sponsor Medical Monitor, and the Study Medical Monitor. 
The membership of the SRC and reporting structure are further defined in the SRC Charter. 
5. SELECTION AND WITHDR AWAL OF PATIENTS

5. Other medical conditions or comorbidities which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with study compliance or data interpretation  
5.3. Removal from Treatment or Assessment  
Patients are free to discontinue treatment or withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason, without penalty to their continuing medical care.  Any discontinuation of treatment or 
withdrawal from the study must be fully documented in the electroni c case report form (eCRF), 
and should be followed up by the Investigator.  The Investigator may withdraw a patient at any 
time if this is considered to be in the best interest of the patient.  
Discontinuation of study drug and withdrawal from the study are described in Section 5.3.1 and Section  5.3.2,  respectively.  
5.3.1. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
The Investigator or designee may discontinue dosing in a patient if the patient: 
• Is in violation of the protocol 
• Experiences a SAE considered to be possibly or definitely related to the study drug or an int olerable AE  
• Becomes pregnant  
• Is found to be considerably noncompliant with the protocol- requirements  
Patients who are pregnant will be discontinued from study drug dosing immediately (see 
Section  7.5.6.6 for reporting and follow-up of pregnancy).  Patients who discontinue treatment 
will be asked to complete the Month 39 visit assessments. 
5.3.2. Withdrawal from Study  
A patient may withdraw from the study at any time.  If a patient chooses to withdraw from the 
study, every effort should be made to conduct early the assessments performed at the Month 39 
visit.  When a patient withdraws from the study, the primary reason for study withdrawal must be

recorded in  the appropriate section of the eCRF and all efforts made to complete and report the 
observations as thoroughly as possible.  If a patient withdraws due to a SAE, the SAE should be 
followed as described in Section 7.5.6. 
5.3.3. Replacement of Patients  
Patients discontinuing from study drug or withdrawing from the study will not be replaced. 
6. TREATMENTS
6.1. Treatments Administered
ALN -AS1 Solution for Injection (SC use) is a clear, colorless to pale yellow solution essentially 
free of particulates.  ALN -AS1 will be supplied by the Sponsor as a sterile solution for SC 
injection.  
Study drug supplied for this study must not be used for any purpose other than the present study 
and must not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study.  Study drug that has been 
dispensed to a patient and returned unused must not be re-dispensed to a different patient. 
6.2. Investigational Study Drug  
Detailed information describing the preparation, handling, and storage, packaging and labeling, 
as well as study drug accountability for ALN-AS1 is provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
6.2.1. Description  
ALN -AS1 Solution for Injection (SC use) is comprised of a synthetic, siRNA targeting ALAS1 
and bearing a triantennary GalNAc ligand conjugated to the sense strand, formulated in 
phosphate buffer.  
6.2.2. Dose and Administration 
The study starting dose of ALN-AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg ALN-AS1 a
s an SC injection administered 
every 3 months (Table 1 and T able 2) . B ased on emerging c linica l data, the SRC may approve 
changes to the ALN-A S1 dosing regimen, including decreases in the dose level and changes in 
dosing frequency (Table 4 and T able 5 in Appendix Section 11.2). H owever, any dose and 
dos
ing regime n will not e xceed a previously explored dose level or frequency that was 
determined to be safe and
 well-tolerated in study ALN -AS1- 001. S RC, Health Authority and 
Ethics Committee approval must be sought prior to dose level escalation above 5.0 mg/kg in 
accordanc e wi
th local Regulatory requi
rements .  See Section  6.2.3 for details on dose 
modi
fications. 
The study drug will be a dministered under the supervision of a healthcare pr
ofessional.  After a 
patient has completed 12 months of ALN-AS1 administration in this study (6 months in an every 
month dosing regimen), and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastruct ure 
allow, study visits and ALN- AS1 administration may take place at the patient’s home by a 
healthcare professional.  Home visits may occur at the discretion of the Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  29

ALN -AS1   Clinical Study  Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
Amendment 2_ 01 December  2016 
study center every 3 months for the first year, and thereafter every 6 months through the end of 
the treatment period.    
If a patient does not receive a dose of ALN -AS1 within the specified dosing window, the 
Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor.  After such consultation, the dose may be administered or considered missed and not administered. 
Patients will be permitted to miss an occasional dose of study drug; however, if a patient misses 
2 consecutive doses, the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, will discuss 
whether the patient will be able to continue on the study.  
Detailed instructions for study drug administration are found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
6.2.3. Dose Modifications 
6.2.3.1. Study Population Dose  Modifications 
During the study, dose modifications are permitted for the study population, or based on the dose 
cohort into which patients were originally randomized in study ALN- AS1-001.  Following SRC 
review of emerging safety and tolerability data from  Part C of study ALN -AS1-001, or from this 
study (ALN -AS1-002), the dose and dosing regimen may be modified.  However, the dose and 
dosing regimen of ALN-AS1 will not exceed a previously explored dose and dosing regimen that 
was determined to be safe and well -tolerated in study ALN- AS1-001.  Patients enrolling in this 
study after a dose modification decision has been implemented may start at the newly identified 
dose and regimen. 
6.2.3.2. Individual Dose Modifications 
Dose modifications are permitted for individual patients.  If a patient has a study drug related AE 
of a recurrent ISR, severe ISR, or clinically significant LFT abnormality and the Investigator has 
concerns regarding further ALN -AS1 administration, the Medical Monitor and Investigator will 
review all available safety data for the patient.  Based on this review, a dose reduction to half the previously administered dose (eg, a 5.0 mg/kg dose would be reduced to a 2.5 mg/kg dose) or a reduction in dosing frequency from monthly to every 3 months is permitted.  Subsequent 
ALN -AS1 administration at the previous dose may be considered based on the judgment of the 
Investigator and Medical Monitor. 
6.2.4. Preparation, Handling, and Storage 
Staff at each clinical study center or the home healthcare professional will be r esponsible for 
preparation of ALN-AS1 doses, according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy Manual.  No 
special procedures for the safe handling of study drug are required. 
Study drug will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately 5±3°C.  Any deviation from 
the recommended storage conditions should be reported to the Sponsor and use of the study drug 
halted until authorization for its continued use has been provided by the Sponsor or designee. 
A Sponsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, 
storage, dispensing procedures, and records.

Amendment 2_ 01 December  2016 
6.2.5. Packaging and Labeling 
ALN -AS1 Solution for Injection (SC use) is packaged in 2 mL glass vials with a fill volume of 
no less than 0.55 mL.  The container closure system consists of a Type I glass vial, a Teflon 
faced bromobutyl 13 mm stopper and a flip-off Truedge aluminum seal. 
6.2.6. Accountability  
The Investigator or designee will maintain accurate records of receipt and the condition of the 
study drug supplied for this study, including dates of receipt.  In addition, accurate records will 
be kept of when and how much study drug is dispensed and administered to each patient in the 
study.  Any reasons for departure from the protocol dispensing regimen must also be recorded. 
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of all study drugs.  All used, 
partially used, and unused study drug will be returned to the Sponsor (or designee) or destroyed 
at the clinical study center according to applicable regulation s.   
6.3. Concomitant Medications  
Use of concomitant medications will be recorded on the patient’s case report form (CRF) as 
indicated in the Schedules of Assessments ( Table 1 and T able 2;  and Table 4 and  Table 5 in 
Appendix Section 11.2) .  This includes all prescription medications, herbal preparations, over the 
counter (OTC) medications, vitamins, and minerals.  Any changes in medications during the study will also be recorded on the CRF. 
Any concomitant medication that is required for the patient’ s welfare may be administered by the 
Investigator.  However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding 
the medication are recorded on the eCRF.  Concomitant medication will be coded using an 
internationally recognized an d accepted coding dictionary. 
ALN -AS1 could potentially increase the clearance of drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isoform.   
Investigators will review all medications at study start and monitor response to these medications during the study.  For patients who require new medications while on study, selection of medications that are not mainly metabolized by the CYP3A isoform is recommended.  A list of 
medications that are sensitive CYP3A substrates is included in  Table 6 Appendix Section 11.3.  
In addition, a more detailed and current list of sensitive CYP3A- metabolized medications and 
CYP3A- metabolized medications with a narrow therapeutic range is available at the Indiana 
University, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, website 
(http://medicin e.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/clinical- table/). [31] 
Patients are not permitted to be on hemin prophylaxis at Screening; however, patients are 
permitted to receive concomitant hemin treatment for the management of acute porphyria 
attacks.  Patients experi encing significant breakthrough attacks while enrolled in this study, 
necessitating frequent hemin treatment, may receive hemin prophylaxis if in the Investigator’s 
judgment this is clinically beneficial to the patient.  The Investigator should contact with the 
Sponsor and Medical Monitor before prophylactic hemin treatment.  The dose, regimen, and dates of administration will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF.   
Pain medication (eg, opiates, opioids, narcotic analgesics) and glucose administration are 
perm itted for the management of porphyria and for acute porphyria attacks.

Amendment 2_ 01 December  2016 
If patients use nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory medications intermittently or chronically, they 
must have been able to tolerate them with no previous side effects (eg, gastric distress or 
bleeding).   
Standard vitamins and topical medications are permitted; however, topical steroids must not be 
applied anywhere near the injection site(s) unless medically indicated.  
6.4. Contraceptive Requirements  
WOCBP must be willing to use acceptable methods  of contraception 14 days before first dose, 
throughout study participation, and for 90 days after last dose administration.  Birth control methods which may be considered as acceptable include: 
• Established use of oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal methods of contraception.  WOCBP using hormonal methods of contraception must also use a 
barrier method (condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault cap] in 
conjunction with spermicide [eg, foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository]).  I f 
hormonal methods of contraception are medically contraindicated for WOCBP due to 
underlying disease, a double-barrier method (combination of male condom with 
either cap, diaphragm, or sponge, in conjunction with spermicide) is also considered an acceptab le method of contraception. 
• Placement of an intrauterine device  
• Placement of an intrauterine hormone- releasing system  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post- vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sp erm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the 
study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient) 
• True sexual abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
patient.  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  Abstinent patients must agree to use 1 of the abovementioned contraceptive methods, if they 
start sexual relationships during the study and for 90 days after last dose 
administration.  
WOCBP includes any female patient who has experienced menarche and who is not 
postmenopausal or permanently sterilized (eg, bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, or 
bilateral salpingectomy).  Postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause, confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone level within the 
postmenopausal range. 
6.5. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with study drug administration will be verified through observation by study 
personnel or trained home healthcare professionals.

7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
The schedule of study assessments is provided in Table 1.  
7.1. Screening/Baseline Assessments  
Informed consent, patient demographic data, and eligibility criteria will be confir med at 
Screening/Baseline.  An interval medical history/disease history will be obtained at 
Screening/Baseline.  The last assessments performed, determining previous study 
(ALN -AS1-001) completion, will serve as the Screening/Baseline assessments in this s tudy.  If 
more than 60 days have elapsed since the last assessment, clinical laboratory tests and ECGs will 
be repeated before administration of ALN- AS1.  
7.2. Clinical Activity Assessments  
The clinical activity of ALN -AS1 will be assessed by the frequency and characteristics of 
porphyria attacks including, but not limited to, duration, treatment, and severity of porphyria attacks and number and duration of visits to a health care setting for acute porphyria care (eg, 
hospital, emergency department, infusion center, or outpatient clinic).  Concomitant hemin administration will also be recorded.

7.5. Safety Assessments  
The assessment of safety during the course of the study will consist of the surveillance and 
record ing of AEs including SAEs, recording of concomitant medications and measurements of 
vital signs, physical examination, and ECG findings and clinical laboratory evaluations. 
Safety will be monitored over the course of the study by an SRC as described in Section  4.6. 
7.5.1. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory 
rate.  Vital signs will be measu red in the seated or supine position (should be consistent for each 
patient), after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  Blood pressure should be taken 
using the same arm throughout the study.  Body temperature will be obtained in degrees Celsius, 
heart rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in beats per minute, and respiration rate 
will be counted for a full minute and recorded in breaths per minute. 
For the safety of the patient, additional vital sign assessments may be added at the discretion of 
the Investigator.  
7.5.2. Weight and Height 
Height will be measured in centimeters at the Screening/Baseline visit only.  Body weight will be 
measured in kilograms.  Body mass index will be calculated in the database.  
7.5.3. Physical Examination 
Compl ete physical examinations will include the examination of the following:  general 
appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, chest/respiratory, heart/cardiovascular, gastrointestinal/liver, musculoskeletal/extremities, dermatological/skin, thyroid/neck , lymph 
nodes, and neurological/psychiatric. 
Targeted physical examinations will include the examination of the following:  general 
appearance, chest/respiratory, heart/cardiovascular, gastrointestinal/liver, and 
neurological/psychiatric.  
7.5.4. Electrocardiogram  
Triplicate 12 -lead ECG, with readings approximately 2 minutes apart, will be recorded.  
Additional ECGs may be collected at the discretion of the Investigator.  Standard computerized 12-lead ECG recordings will be obtained.  Each lead shall be recorded for at least 3 beats at a 
speed of 25 mm/s.  Recordings will be obtained, after the patient has rested comfortably for approximately 10 minutes.  The electrophysiological parameters assessed include rhythm, 
ventricular rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT int erval, ST and T waves, Bazett -corrected QT 
interval (QTcB) and Fridericia -corrected QT interval (QTcF).  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for reviewing the ECGs to assess whether the results have changed since the Screening/Baseline visit and to determine the clinical relevance of the 
results.  These assessments will be recorded on the eCRF.  For any clinically relevant ECG changes from the Screening/Baseline visit (eg, ischemic ECG changes, wave/interval changes, or

arrhythmia), the Investigator must contact the Medical Monitor to discuss continued participation 
of the patient in the study. 
7.5.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory.   
Results from clinical laboratory tests collected on dosing days are not required before study drug 
administration; however, if results for clinical laboratory tests from the previous study visit are 
not available or are deemed clinically significant, then clinical laboratory assessments must be 
repeated and the results must be deemed acceptable by the Investigator before study drug 
administration.  
In the event of an unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study drug administ ration, the test should be repeated and followed up at the discretion of the 
Investigator until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis is made to 
adequately explain the abnormality.  
At any point during the study, and based on Investigator judgment, if a patient experiences 
uncharacteristic signs and symptoms during a porphyria attack, lipase testing should be performed and imaging evaluations (eg, right upper quadrant ultrasound and/or other testing, 
based on Investigator judgment) should be considered by the Investigator.  Signs and symptoms include, but are not limited to, uncharacteristic abdominal pain and worsening nausea and 
vomiting.  
Imaging is required for any serum lipase result of ≥3× the upper limit of normal, or as clinically 
indicated.

7.5.6. Adverse Events  
7.5.6.1. Definitions  
Adverse Even t 
According to the ICH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 21 Code of Federal Regulations 312.32, Investigational New Drug Safety Reporting, an AE is 
any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (An event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred.  It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient and may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above (eg, 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug dependency or abuse). 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential    37 
487
ALN -AS1  Clinical Study  Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
Amendment 2_ 01 December  2016 
Adverse Event Severity  
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below:  
Mild:  Mild events are those which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal 
daily activity.  
Moderate:  Moderate events are those which cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with 
normal daily activities.  
Severe:  Severe events are those which incapacitate and prevent usual activity.  
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity.  AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence.  When changes in the severity of an AE 
occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day should 
be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be 
recorded separately (with distinct onset dates)  
AE severity and seriousness are assessed independently.  ‘Severity’ characterizes the intensity of an AE.  ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for Serious Adverse Event). 
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Treatment  
The relationship of each AE to study treatment should be evaluated by the Investigator using the 
following criteria:  
Definitely related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to the medication administration, and which cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  The response to withdrawal of the drug should be clinically plausible. 
Possibly related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to the medication administration, but which 
could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  Information on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Unlikely related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no temporal relationship to medication administration, and which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations. 
Not related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality that has no temporal relationship  to the medication or has more likely alternative 
etiology.  
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest  
The following events are considered to be adverse events of clinical interest: 
•ISRs
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  38 
488
ALN -AS1  Clinical Study  Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
Amendment 2_ 01 December  2016 
•Hepatic AEs, including LFT abnormalities considered clinically significant by the
Investigator .
7.5.6.2. Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last 
visit.  The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospitalized, had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC).  
In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant 
laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are relevant to patient safety.  
Recording Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for recording non-serious AEs that are observed or reported by the patient after administration of the first dose of study drug reg ardless of their relationship to 
study drug through the end of study.  Non-serious AEs will be followed until the end of study.  
The Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by the patient 
after the time when the informe d consent is signed regardless of their relationship to study drug 
through the end of study.  SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until baseline level is reached, or until the SAE is considered by the Investigator to be chronic or the pati ent is 
stable, as appropriate.  
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for the patient, whether or not they are considered to be drug- related.  Each AE must be described in 
detail:  onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to investigational drug, 
action taken, and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
For SAEs, record the event(s) on the eCRF.  If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is 
unavailable, complete the backup SAE form.  
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest, additional clinical information may be collected based upon the severity or nature of the event. 
If a patient has ISRs meeting any of the following criteria, the Investigator or delegate should 
contact the Medical Monitor and submit a supplemental ISR eCRF: 
•ISRs that are recurrent and/or demonstrate a pattern of increasing severity
•Any ISR that is determined to be severe and/or a cause for study drug discontinuation
•Any ISR  which, in the opinion of the Investigator, requires further medical evaluation or
treatment
In some cases, where it is medically appropriate, further evaluation may include photographs, 
referral to a dermatologist, skin biopsy, or other laboratory testing.  If a biopsy was obtained, the Sponsor may request that the biopsy also be reviewed by a central dermatopathologist.  To better 
understand the safety profile of the study drug, additional analysis of biopsy tissue may be 
performed according to local regulations.

Amendment 2_ 01 December  2016 
For patients with hepatic AEs, additional information, including, clinical history, course of event, 
and local laboratory results to monitor LFT levels or other laboratory parameters, may be 
collected.  
7.5.6.3. Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee 
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by the Investigator.  Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that m eets the SAE criteria in Section 7.5.6.1 
must be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee within 24 hours from the time that clinica l study center personnel first 
learns of the event.  All SAEs must be reported regardless of the relationship to study drug. 
The initial report should inclu
de at least the following information:  
•Patient’s study number
•Description and date of onset of the event
•Criterion for serious
•Preliminary assignment of relationship to study drug
•Investigator/clinical study center information
To report the SAE, complete the eCRF.  If the EDC system is unavailable, complete the backup 
SAE form.  Within 24 hours of receipt of follow-up information, the Investigator must update the report.  SAEs must be reported using the contact information provided in the Study Manual. 
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken by the Investigator using his/her best medical 
judgment to treat the SAE.  These measures and the patient’s response to these measures should 
be recorded.  All SAEs, regardless of relatio nship to study drug, will be followed by the 
Investigator until satisfactory resolution or the Investigator deems the SAE to be chronic or 
stable.  Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed by the Investigator as 
needed to adequately  determine the etiology of the event.  
7.5.6.4. Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities 
The Sponsor or its representative is required to report certain study events in an expedited 
manner to the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency’ s EudraVigilance 
electronic system according to Directive 2001/20/EC, and to all country Regulatory Authorities where the study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations. 
The following describes the safety reporting timeline requirements for suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) and other reportable events: 
Immediately and within 7 calendar days 
•Any suspected adverse reaction that is associated with the use of the study drug,
unexpected, and fatal or life threatening.  Follow-up information must be reported in
the following 8 days.
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  40 
490
ALN -AS1  Clinical Study  Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
Amendment 2_ 01 December  2016 
Immediately and within 15 calendar days 
•Any suspected adverse reaction that is associated with the use of the study drug,
unexpected, and serious, but not fatal or life threatening, and there is evidence to
suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the reaction.
•Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggest a significant risk for human
patients including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.
•Any event in connection with the conduct of the study or the development of the
study drug that may affect the safety of the trial patients.
In addition, periodic safety reporting to regulatory authorities will be performed by the Sponsor 
or its representative according to national and local regulations. 
7.5.6.5. Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
SUSARs will be reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC)  per their institutional policy by the Investigator or Sponsor (or Sponsor 
designee) according to country requirements.  Copies of each report and documentation of IRB/IEC notification and acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator’s study file. 
7.5.6.6. Pregnancy Reporting  
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the course of this study through 90 days following the last dose of study drug, the Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of being notified of the pregnancy.  Details of the pregnancy will be recorded on 
the pregnancy reporting form.  The patient should receive any necessary counseling regarding 
the risks of continuing the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. 
The pregnancy should be followed by the Investigator until completion.  At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy.  If the outcome of the 
pregnancy results in a postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neona tal death, 
or congenital anomaly, then the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE 
as outlined in Section 7.5.6.3.   
7.5.6.7. Overdose Reporting  
An overdose is defined as any dose administered to or taken by a patient (accidentally or 
intentionally) that exceeds the highest daily dose, or is at a higher frequency, than included in the 
protocol.  It is up to the investigator to decide whether a dose is to be considered an overdose, in 
consultation with the Sponsor.  Overdose must be recorded in the eCRF. 
All reports of overdose (with or without an AE) must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor 
or designee.

confidential, whose use is for the purpose of conducting the study.  The Sponsor must approve 
any transfer of information not directly involved in the study. 
In compliance with local and/or regional regulations, this clinical study may be registered and 
study results may be posted on public registries, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. 
9.1.4. End of the Study  
The end of the study is defined as last patient last visit.  
9.1.5. Discontinuation of the Clinical Study  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study for clinical or administrative reasons at 
any time.  If the clinical study center do es not recruit at a reasonable rate, the study may be 
discontinued at that clinical study center.  Should the study be terminated and/or the clinical 
study center closed for whatever reason, all documentation and study drug pertaining to the study 
must be returned to the Sponsor or its representative, and the Investigators, IEC/IRB and 
Regulatory Authorities will be promptly informed of the termination and the reason for the decision.  The Investigator should promptly inform the patients and assure appropri ate therapy 
and follow-up.  Patients should then be withdrawn from the study.   
9.2. Data Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
9.2.1. Data Handling 
Study data must be recorded on case report forms (paper and/or electronic) provided by the Sponsor or designee on behalf of the Sponsor.  Case report forms must be completed only by 
persons designated by the Investigator.  If eCRFs are used, study data must be entered by trained 
clinical study center personnel with access to a valid and secure eCRF system.  All data entered into the eCRF must also be available in the source documents.  Corrections on paper CRFs must 
be made so as to not obliterate the original data and must be initialed and dated by the person 
who made the correction. 
9.2.2. Study Monitoring  
The clinical monitor, as a representative of the Sponsor, has an obligation to closely follow the 
study conduct at the clinical study center.  The monitor will visit the Investigator and clinical

study center periodically and will maintain frequent telephone and written contact.  The monitor 
will maintain current personal knowledge of the study through observation, review of study 
records and source documentation, and discussion of the conduct of the study with the 
Investigator and personnel. 
The monitor will review source documents, systems and CRFs to ensure overall quality and 
completeness of the data and to confirm study procedures are complied with the requirements in 
the study protocol.  The Sponsor, or its designee, will be allowed to conduct clinical study center visits to the investigation facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study.  The 
Investigator agrees to allow the monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug 
accountability records, patient charts and study source documents, and other records relative to study conduct. 
9.2.3. Audits and Inspections  
Periodically, the Sponsor or its authorized representatives audit clinical investigative study 
centers as an independent review of core trial processes and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported 
according to the protocol, GCP guidelines of the ICH, and any applicable regulatory 
requirements.  A regulatory authority, an IEC or an IRB may visit the clinical study center to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification.  The Investigator should contact 
the Sponsor, or its designee, immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency about an 
inspection. 
9.3. Publication Policy  
It is intended that after completion of the study, the data are to be submitted for publication in a 
scientific journal and/or for reporting at a scientific meeting.  A copy of any proposed manuscript 
must be provided and confirmed received at the Sponsor at least 30 days before its submission, and according to any additional publication details in the Investigator Agreement.

a Patients are not required to complete Screening/Baseline assessments if the assessments in the previous study (ALN -AS1-001) were completed within 60 days 
of administration of the first dose of ALN -AS1 in this study.  If more than 60  days have elapsed since the last assessment, clinical laboratory tests and ECGs 
will be repeated before administration of ALN -AS1.  Results should be available and deemed acceptable before the administration of the first dose of ALN -

Amendment 2_ 01 December  2016 
b After a patient has completed 6 months of ALN -AS1 administration in this study, and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, 
study visits and ALN -AS1 administration may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional.  Home visits may occur at the d iscretion of the 
Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical s tudy center Q3M through M12, and 
thereafter Q6M.  
c See Section  7.1 for details on the interval medical history/disease history to be recorded at Screening/Baseline.  Ongoing AEs from the previ ous study 
(ALN -AS1-001) will be captured as medical history.  
d A compl ete physical examination will be performed at Screening/Baseline, and D1.  At all other visits, a targeted physical examinati on will be performed.  On 
dosing days, the physical examination will be performed predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administere d, the physical examination can occur at any time 
during the visit.  See Section  7.5.3  for details on the physical examination.  
e Height will be mea sured at Screening/Baseline only.  
f Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate.  On D1, vital signs will be collected  within 1 hour predose; and 2  hours 
(±10  minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, vital si gns will be collected within 1 hour predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, vital signs 
can be collected at any time during the visit.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be cons istent for each patient), after  the 
patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  
g Triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine position after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  On D1, ECGs will be 
performed within 1 hour predose and 2 hours (±10 minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, ECGs will be collected within 1 hour predose.  
h Clinical laboratory parameters are described in Section  7.5.5 .  On dosing days, blood samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected within 1 hour 
predose .  Results from clinical laboratory tests collected on dosing days are not required before study drug administration; however, if results for clinical 
laboratory tests from the previous study visit are not available or are deemed clinically significant, then clinical laboratory assessments must be repeated and 
the results must be deemed acceptable by the Investigator before study drug administration.   On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, blood samples can 
be collected at any time during the visit.  
i A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening/Baseline; thereafter, urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  Results must be available before dosing.  
j ALN -AS1 will be administered by SC injection according to the Pharmacy Manual.  See Section  6.2.2  for ALN -AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  For weight -
based dosing, weight measured on the dosing day will be used to calculate the dose of ALN -AS1.  After M12, weight measured on the nearest previous visit 
will be used to calculate the weight -based dose  of ALN -AS1.  
k Spot urine samples will be collected for measurement of ALA, PBG, and creatinine levels.  On dosing days, samples should be collected predose.  
l On dosing days, blood and urine samples for ALAS1 mRNA (and possible biomarker) analysis will be  collected within 1 hour predose.  
m Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points listed in  Table  3 (Appendix Section  11.1).  
n On dosing days, blood samples for antidrug antibody analysis should be collected within 1 hour predose.  
oPorphyria attack laboratory sample collection k its should be dispensed at the screening visit along with instructions for use. For any attack that occurs through
M39, u rine samples should be collected within 24 hours of the start of clinical intervention (eg, hemin or glucose administration) and within  24 hours of the end
of clinical intervention .  If patients are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laboratory sample collection kits should be used
for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center,  if possible.  These urine samples may also be analyzed for exploratory biomarkers.
p In addition to the time points indicated, the EQ -5D-5L questionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a porphyria attack 
(but not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible.  
q Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain assessments, and narcotic use on  a daily basis through M9; 
thereafter, acute porphyria attacks will be recorded in the diary.  The BPI will be completed on a weekly basis as part of the patient diary through M9, then Q3M.  
r Medications that are ongoing from the previous study (ALN -AS1-001), started between the previous study and this study, and started after signing informed 
consent in this study, will be captured as concomitant medication(s).

time during the visit.  See Section  7.5.3  for details on the physical examination.  
e Height will be measured at Screening/Baseline only.  
f Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate.  On a dosing days, vital signs will b e collect ed within 1 hour predose.  On 
days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, vital signs can be collected at any time during the visit.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position 
(should be consistent for each patient), after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  
g Triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine position after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  On dosing days, ECGs will 
be collected within 1 hour predose.  
h Clinical laboratory para meters are described in Section  7.5.5 .  On dosing days, blood samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected within 1 hour 
predose   Results from clinical laboratory tests collected on dosing days are not required before study drug administration; however, if results for clinical 
laboratory tests from the previous study visit are not available or are deemed clinically significant, then clinical laboratory assessments must be repeated and 
the results must be deemed acceptable by the Investigator before study drug administration.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, blood samples can 
be collected at any time during the visit.  
i Urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  Results must be available before dosing.  
j ALN -AS1 will be administered by SC injection according to the Pharmacy Manual.  See Section  6.2.2  for ALN -AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  Weight 
measured on the nearest previous visit will be used to calculate the weight -based dose of ALN -AS1.

ALN -AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
 Amendment 2 Summary of Changes_01 December 2016 
 
ALN- AS1-002 Protocol Amendment 2 
Summary of Changes (dated 01 December 2016)  
compared to Protocol Amendment 1 (dated 10 November 2016) 
A Multicenter, Open -label Extension Study to Evaluate the Long-term Safety and Clinical 
Activity of Subcutaneously Administered ALN AS1 in Patients with Acute Intermittent 
Porphyria who have Completed a Previous Clinical Study with ALN- AS1 
 
Rationale for Protocol Amendment  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to implement additional safety monitoring; 
specifically to require lipase monitoring and review of recent clinical laboratory results prior to dosing.  These changes are being made in accordance with the study's Safety Review Committee 
recomm endation pursuant to an unlikely related SAE of hemorrhagic pancreatitis with fatal 
outcome. This amendment includes the following changes: 
• A Day 14 clinic visit has been added to allow safety assessment approximately 2 weeks following the first study drug dose. 
• Lipase has been added to the battery of serum chemistry parameters regularly collected 
throughout the study 
• Laboratory results from the previous clinical visit are now required to be available prior 
to each dose. If results from the previous visit a re clinically significant or are not 
available, assessments must be repeated and the results must be deemed acceptable by the Investigator before study drug administration 
• Lipase testing is now required, and imaging should be considered by the Investigator, 
when a patient experiences uncharacteristic signs and symptoms during a porphyria attack.  
• Imaging is now required following a clinical laboratory test result of serum lipase ≥3× the 
upper limit of normal. 
Additionally, out of date text describing the nonclinical and clinical experience with ALN- AS1 
has been removed and replaced with a reference to the current Investigator's Brochure, which has been updated to include a description of the aforementioned unlikely related fatal SAE. 
A detailed su mmary of the changes is provided in Table 1.  Corrections to typographical errors 
and formatting are not detailed .

The primary change occurs in Section 1 INTRODUCTION 
Now reads:  Section 1.3.1 Nonclinical Summary and Section 1.3.2 Clinical Summary have been removed.  
Subsequent sections have been renumbered appropriately. Section 1.3 now reads: 
ALN- AS1 comprises a synthetic siRNA  covalently linked to a GalNAc containing ligand 
(ALN60519), specific for ALAS1 and formulated for administration via subcutaneous (SC) 
injection. ALN -60519 has a target region between nucleotide 918 to 937 of the ALAS1 mRNA. 
Attachment to a triantennary G alNAc ligand to the siRNA enables its distribution to the liver 
(which is the primary site of ALAS1 synthesis), followed by intracellular delivery to hepatocytes via ASGPR, resulting in engagement of the RNAi pathway and suppression of hepatic ALAS1 protei n synthesis.  
ALN- AS1 is currently in development for treatment of acute attacks in patients with AIP, the 
most common AHP.  
Further information on ALN -AS1, including the clinical and nonclinical experience to date, is 
available in in the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).

Study Design  
This is a multicenter, open -label extension study to evaluate the long -term safety and clinical activity 
of ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP who completed study ALN -AS1-001. 
The last assessments performed, determining previous study (A LN-AS1-001) completion, will serve as 
the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed since the last 
assessment, safety assessments will be repeated before administration of ALN -AS1.  It is anticipated 
that patients wil l begin ALN -AS1 administration in this study within 6 months after the last dose of 
study drug in the previous study.  Eligibility will be confirmed before administration of the first dose of 
ALN -AS1 (Day 1).  Patients will undergo assessments at the clini cal study center every month for the 
first 3 months.   Then, through Month 6, and according to the dosing regimen selected, assessments will 
take place at the clinical study center or via a phone contact (for an every month dosing regimen, visits 
will be ev ery month; for an every 3 months dosing regimen, visits will be every 3 months).  A fter a 
patient has completed 6 months of ALN -AS1 administration in this study  (6 months in an every month 
dosing regimen), and where applicable country and local regulation s and infrastructure allow, study 
visits and ALN -AS1 administration may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional.  
Home visits may occur at the discretion of the Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, 
patients are req uired to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical study center every 3 months for the first 
year, and thereafter every 6 months through the end of the treatment period.  Patients will return to the 
clinical study center for a posttreatment follow -up visit  after administration of the last dose of 
ALN -AS1.  An ALA/PBG Monitoring/EOS visit will be conducted either at the clinical study center or 
via phone contact, unless treatment continues with ALN -AS1.  
Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to  record acute porphyria attacks, pain assessments, 
and narcotic use.  Patients will also be provided with laboratory sample collection kits and instructions 
for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center.  
A Safety Review Committee  (SRC) will review safety and tolerability data collected during the study 
with the primary purpose of protecting the safety of patients participating in the study.  
Number of Planned Patients  
Up to 24 patients are planned for enrollment in this study (includ ing optional cohorts in 
ALN -AS1-001). 
Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria  
Patients with AIP, who have completed Part C of study ALN -AS1-001, will be eligible for screening in 
this study.  Eligible patients will not be on a scheduled regimen of hemin t o prevent porphyria attacks 
at Screening.  Patients with alanine transaminase ≥2.0× upper limit of normal, total bilirubin ≥2  mg/dL 
(unless bilirubin elevation is due to Gilbert’s syndrome), or estimated glomerular filtration rate 
≤30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (using th e Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) at Screening are not 
eligible for this study.  
Investigational Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
ALN -AS1 Solution for Injection (subcutaneous use [SC]) is comprised of a synthetic, small interfering 
RNA targeting ALAS1 and bearing a triantennary N -acetyl galactosamine ligand conjugated to the 
sense strand, formulated in phosphate buffer.   
The study starting dose and regimen of ALN -AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg as an SC injection administered eve ry 
3 months.  Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may approve changes to the dosing regimen , 
including decreases in the dose level and changes in the dosing frequency .  However  any dose and 
dosing regimen will not exceed a previously explored dose level or frequency  that was determined to 
517

Amendment 1_ 10 November 2016 
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 6 be safe and well -tolerated in study ALN -AS1-001, SRC, Health Authority  and Ethics Committee 
approval must  be sought prior  to dose escalation  above 5.0 mg/kg  in accordance with local Regulatory 
requirements .  
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Not applicable  
Duration of Treatment and Study  
The duration of treatment i s up to 36 months.  The estimated total time on study, inclusive of 
Screening/Baseline, for each patient is up to 44 months.  
Statistical Methods  
Statistical analyses will be primarily descriptive.  Incidence of AEs will be summarized by maximum 
severity a nd relationship to ALN -AS1.  Incidence of and serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs 
leading to discontinuation will also be tabulated.  By -patient listings will be provided for deaths, SAEs, 
and events leading to discontinuation.  
Laboratory shift tables f rom baseline to worst values will be presented.  Abnormal physical 
examination findings and electrocardiogram data will be presented in by -patient listings.  Descriptive 
statistics will be provided for electrocardiogram interval data and presented as both actual values and 
changes from baseline relative to each on study evaluation and to the last evaluation on -study.  
Clinical activity of ALN -AS1 will be summarized primarily by descriptive statistics.  The clinical 
activity of ALN -AS1 will be evaluated by th e frequency and characteristics of porphyria attacks 
including duration, treatment, and severity of porphyria attacks and number and duration of visits to a 
health care setting for acute porphyria care.  Patient diary recordings, including BPI -SF questionn aire 
scores, will also be summarized.   
PD analysis will include the evaluation of change in ALA, PBG, and ALAS mRNA levels.  Descriptive 
statistics (eg, mean and standard error of the mean) for observed levels of PD parameters and the 
relative change from  baseline will be presented for each of the postdose follow -up time points.  
The PK concentration of ALN -AS1 will be determined.  Antidrug antibody results will be tabulated 
overall and by previous treatment in the previous study (ALN -AS1-001).  A by -patien t listing will also 
be provided.  
Additional exploratory analyses may be conducted on analytes related to targeting the heme 
biosynthesis pathway.  Quality of life scores will also be summarized.

of administration of the first dose of ALN-AS1 in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed since the last assessment, clinical laboratory tests and ECGs 
will be repeated before administration of ALN-AS1.  Results should be available before the administration of the first dose of ALN-AS1. 
b After a patient has completed 12 months of ALN-AS1 administration in this study, and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, 
study visits and ALN- AS1 administration may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare pro fessional.  Home visits may occur at the discretion of the 
Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical study center Q6M. 
c See Section  7.1 for details on the interval medical history/disease history to be recorded at Screening/Baseline.  Ongoing AEs from the previous study 
(ALN-AS1-001) will be captured as medical history.

ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 1_ 10 November 2016 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential     9 d A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening/Baseline, and D1.  At all other visits, a targeted physical examination will be performed.  On 
dosing days, the physical examination will be performed predose.  On days when ALN-AS1 is not administered, the physical examination can occur at any time 
during the visit.  See Section  7.5.3  for details on the physical examination. 
e Height will be measured at Screening/Baseline only. 
f Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate.  On D1, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose; and 2 hours 
(±10 minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose.  On days when ALN-AS1 is not administered, vital signs 
can be collected at any time during the visit.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be consistent for each patient), after the 
patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes. 
g Triplicate 12-lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine position after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  On D1, ECGs will be 
performed within 1 hour predose and 2 hours (±10 minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, ECGs will be collected within 1 hour predose. 
h Clinical laboratory parameters are described in Section  7.5.5 .  On dosing days, blood samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected within 1 hour 
predose; results are not required before dosing.  On days when ALN- AS1 is not administered, blood samples can be collected at any time during the visit. 
i A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening/Baseline; thereafter, urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  Results must be available before dosing. 
j ALN-AS1 will be administered by SC injection according to the Pharmacy Manual.  See Section  6.2.2  for ALN-AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  For 
weight-based dosing, weight measured on the dosing day will be used to calculate the dose of ALN-AS1.  After M12, weight measured on the nearest previous 
visit will be used to calculate the weight-based dose of ALN-AS1. 
k Spot urine samples will be collected for measurement of ALA, PBG, and creatinine levels.  On dosing days, samples should be collected predose. 
l On dosing days, blood and urine samples for ALAS1 mRNA (and possible biomarker) analysis will be collected within 1 hour predose. 
m Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points listed in  Table 3  (Appendix Section  11.1). 
n On dosing days, blood samples for antidrug antibody analysis should be collected within 1 hour predose. 
o Porphyria attack laboratory sample collection kits should be dispensed at the screening visit along with instructions for use. For any attack that occurs through 
M39, urine samples should be collected within 24 hours of the start of clinical intervention (eg, hemin or glucose administration) and within 24 hours of the end 
of clinical intervention.  If patients are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laboratory sample collection kits will be provided 
that contain instructions for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center, if possible.  These urine samples may also be analyzed for 
exploratory biomarkers. 
p In addition to the time points indicated, the EQ- 5D-5L questionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a porphyria attack 
(but not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible.  
q Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain assessments, and narcotic use on a daily basis through M9; 
thereafter, acute porphyria attacks will be recorded in the diary.  The BPI will be completed on a weekly basis as part of the patient diary through M9, then 
Q3M. 
r Patients will be contacted by phone to collect AEs and concomitant medications.  Patients will also be reminded to collect and send urine samples to the clinical 
study center, if possible, if they are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack. 
s Medications that are ongoing from the previous study (ALN-AS1-001), started between the previous study and this study, and started after signing informed 
consent in this study, will be captured as concomitant medication(s).

Amendment 1_ 10 November 2016 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   19 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Disease Overview 
The porphyrias are a family of rare metabolic disorders predominately caused by a genetic 
mutation in 1 of the 8 enzymes responsible for heme synthesis. [1]  The 2 major categories are 
er
ythropoietic and hepatic, depending on the major site of expression of the underlying enzyme 
deficiency. [2]  I n addition, the porphyrias are classified as acute if patients present with 
neurovisceral symptoms (eg, abdominal pain and neurologic symptoms) or cutaneous if they 
present with dermal blistering or photosensitivity. [3, 4]   
This s
tudy will include patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), the most common acute 
hepatic porphyria (AHP).  AIP occurs as a result of an autosomal dominant mutation leading to 
partial deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), the third enzyme in the heme 
biosynthesis pathway. [5]  The rate limiting step in heme synthesis is the upstream enzyme 
5-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1), which is controlled by feedback repression via the 
end-
product heme.  In response to a decrease in endogenous heme in the liver, as can occur with 
fasti
ng, hormonal alterations, or with cytochrome P450 (CYP) inducing drugs, ALAS1 is 
induced, resulting in increased flux through the heme synthesis pathway.  In patients with AIP, 
this can result in the marked accumulation of the toxic heme intermediates porphobilinogen 
(PBG) and delta aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in the blood and urine due to the deficiency in the 
downstream PBGD.  Clinically, this manifests as acute attacks characterized by severe 
abdominal pain, cardiovascular as well as neurologic and psychiatric dysfunction.[ 6] 
1.1.1. Epidemiology 
Ove
r 370 mutations have been identified in the PBGD gene, which in most instances result in its 
reduction by approximately 50%.  The exact prevalence of AIP is unknown due to under 
diagnosis, variation by geographic region, and the differences in penetrance observed for the 
different mutations. [2]  How ever, it is estimated that the prevalence of AIP is 5 to 10 per 
100,000 people in Western countries, while in Sweden it occurs in 1 in 1,000 people due to a 
founder effect associated with the resultant G593A mutation. [7-10]  AIP shows incomplete 
pene
trance and on average only 10% to 50% of carriers with a mutation present with clinical 
symptoms. [11]  It has been proposed that unknown inherited co-factors, in addition to PBGD 
mutations, may explain why a small percentage of patients present with much more severe 
disease while the majority remain asymptomatic. 
Patients with AIP present with acute attacks characterized by neurovisceral symptoms and signs 
including severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or less commonly diarrhea, 
hypertension, tachycardia, fever, muscle weakness, as well as neurological (eg, neuropathy, 
seizures) and psychiatric (eg, anxiety and confusion) manifestations. [12]  AIP attacks typically 
start a
fter puberty and can be triggered by exogenous factors such as medications (especially 
barbiturates, sulfonamides, and hydantoins), stress, exogenous hormones, nutritional status, and 
infection.  Clinically active disease is more common in women, where attacks often occur around 
the menstrua
l cycle and are likely precipitated by hormonal changes. 
Many AIP patients remain undiagnosed given that the disease is rare and characterized by 
non-specific symptoms (eg, abdominal pain and nausea). [2]  The initial diagnosis involves

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 20 demonstrating elevated urinary PBG (typically 20-50 × normal reference range) and ALA 
(typically 5-20 × normal reference range) when the patient is having acute attack symptoms.  
Once a test is positive for elevated ALA and PBG and porphyria is suspected, genetic testing for 
a PBGD mutation is performed.   
There are 4 main clinical phenotypes of AIP.  Latent gene carriers have never had an acute attack 
and are biochemically inactive (normal urinary ALA and PBG).  Asymptomatic high excreters 
(ASHE) do not have current acute attacks, but are biochemically active (increased urinary ALA 
and PBG).  The increased levels of ALA and PBG in ASHE patients are lower than those in AIP 
patients during an acute attack, but are still significantly higher than normal reference values. [6-
8]Sporadic attack patients have infrequent acute attacks.  Re c urrent attack patients have
≥4 attacks per year requiring hospitalization or treatment by a medical professional. [7] 
1.1.2. Current Management and Unmet Medical Need 
Mana
gement of acute attacks often requires hospitalization.  Patients are initially treated with 
supportive care and carbohydrate loading, analgesics and anti-emetics, and removal of known 
precipitating factors. [13]  In patients with moderate to severe attacks, or who fail to respond to 
supportive me
asures, treatment with intravenous (IV) hemin (daily for 3-5 days) is commenced.  
Symptoms typically begin to improve after 2 to 5 days of hemin treatment, accompanied by a 
lowering of urinary ALA and PBG levels to below or at the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
reference value; however, in some patients attacks can last several weeks, requiring prolonged 
hemin use and hospitalization. [14]  W ith prolonged and severe attacks, cranial nerve 
involvement can occur, leading to bulbar paralysis, respiratory failure, and death. [15]  
He
min, a blood derived therapy, was approved as Normosang® (heme arginate) in the European
Union (EU) and as Panhematin® (lyophilised hematin) in the United States (US) in 1999 and
1983, re
spectively. [16, 17]  In the EU, heme arginate is indicated for the treatment of acute 
attacks of hepatic porphyria (eg, AIP, variegate porphyria, and hereditary coproporphyria); 
whereas, in the US lyophilized hemin is limited to the amelioration of recurrent attacks of AIP 
temporally related to the menstrual cycle.  Approval of both products was based on biochemical 
efficacy (ie, lowering of ALA and PBG) as well as data from uncontrolled case series and case 
reports.
[18-22]   Hemin side effects include thrombophlebitis, transient anticoagulation, and in 
rare cases, anaphylaxis or renal failure. [22-24]   I n addition, hemin administration requires a large 
vein for administration, often necessitating central venous access. 
While the majority of patients who experience attacks have them sporadically, it is estimated that 
up to 1,000 AIP patients experience recurre
nt attacks (typically defined as ≥4 pe r year) in the US 
and EU combined. [25]  While hemin is currently only appr oved to ameliorate acute attacks, it is 
administered prophylactically in some patients with recurrent attacks (eg , administered every 
1-2 weeks). [26]  Potential problems associated with chronic hemin administration include 
inf
usion site phlebiti s, iron overload, and the nee d for chronic I V access and associated 
complications (eg, risk of infection or occlusion). [5]  In addition, there hav e been reports of a 
decrease in efficacy with chronic hemin administration, as evidenced by the need to increase the 
frequency or dosage of hemin prophylaxis over time in attempt to maintain a clinical effect. [27]  
In p
atients with very severe recurrent attacks, or in whom hemin treatment is not effective, liver 
transplantation can be curative; however, organ transplantation is a high-risk procedure and is 
rarely used as a treatment option [34].  Given the significant morbidity and mortality, there 
532
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 1_ 10 November 2016 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   21 remains a significant unmet need for an efficacious, simple, fast-acting and better tolerated 
treatment for acute or prevent recurrent attacks in patients with AIP. 
1.2. RNA Interference 
RNA interference (RNAi) is a naturally occurring cellular mechanism mediated by small 
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for regulating gene expression.  Typically, synthetic siRNAs are 
19 to 25 base pair double stranded oligonucleotides in a staggered duplex with a 2-nucleotide 
overha
ng at both or 1 of the 3’ ends. [28]  Such siRNAs can be designed to target an endogenous 
messenge
r RNA (mRNA) transcript of a given gene.  When introduced into cells, the net effect 
of an RNAi-based pharmacological approach is the binding of the siRNA to its complementary 
mRNA sequence, cleavage of this target mRNA, and reduction of synthesis of the target protein, 
resulting in a decrease of the target protein levels. [29]  The  ability to selectively and potently 
degrade the mRNA encoding the ALAS1 protein (thereby decreasing accumulation of the toxic 
inte
rmediates ALA and PBG) using an siRNA is a novel approach for the prevention and 
treatment of acute attacks in patients with AIP.   
1.3. ALN-AS1 
ALN-AS1 is a synthetic RNAi therapeutic currently in development for treatment of acute 
attacks in patients with AIP, the most common AHP. 
1.3.1. Nonclinical S ummary 
The pharmacology, safety pharmacology, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics and toxicology 
of ALN-AS1 were evaluated in a series of in vitro and in vivo nonclinical studies. 
ALN-AS1 is pharmacologically active in rodents and nonhuman primates (NHP) due to 
conservation within the siRNA target sequence.  Transfection assays in human liver carcinoma 
cell line-G2 cells showed dose-dependent inhibition of endogenous ALAS1 mRNA levels with 
an half-maximal inhibitory concentration of approximately 26 pM of ALN-AS1.  In multiple 
studies in the mouse, rat, and NHP, potent and dose-dependent pharmacologic activity has been 
demonstrated with subcutaneous (SC) administration of ALN-AS1, which results in consistent 
reduction of ALAS1 mRNA in liver.  After single dose administration, ALAS1 mRNA 
suppression in liver is durable depending on the dose administered (1-4 weeks) and correlates 
with the extent of ALAS1 mRNA suppression observed in serum or urine.  Dose dependent, 
steady-state ALAS1 mRNA reduction has also been demonstrated with repeat-dose regimens.  
Studies in rodent AIP models have confirmed that ALAS1 mRNA reduction with ALN-AS1 
treatment correlates with decreases in ALA and PBG heme intermediates. 
A Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant safety pharmacology study conducted in NHPs 
showed no functional cardiovascular or respiratory effects, with a no observed effect level 
(NOEL) of 150 mg/kg.  Neurological assessments were conducted as part of a 13-week repeat 
dose GLP toxicity study in NHPs (weekly dosing); no ALN-AS1-related neurobehavioral 
observations occurred, with a NOEL for neurological effects of 150 mg/kg (highest dose tested).  
Genetic toxicity studies (bacterial reverse mutation, human peripheral blood lymphocyte 
chromosomal aberrations, and rat bone marrow micronucleus) assays were all negative at 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) S2 (R1) limit doses. 
533
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 1_ 10 November 2016 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   22 Two to 4-week exploratory (non-GLP) dose-range finding toxicology studies were conducted 
with ALN-AS1 in mice, rats, and NHPs.  In all 3 species, no dose-limiting toxicity was observed 
up to the highest dose evaluated (300 mg/kg weekly SC dose), with the rat appearing to be the 
most sensitive species.  These studies were followed by 13-week GLP toxicology studies in rats 
and NHPs where ALN-AS1 was administered daily (100 mg/kg) and weekly at doses of 0, 3, 10, 
and 30 mg/kg in the rat and weekly at doses of 0, 15, 50, and 150 mg/kg in the NHP.  The no 
observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) were 30 mg/kg in the rat and 150 mg/kg in the NHP 
(highe
st dose tested in each species).   
Preliminary results from 26-week and 39-week GLP chronic toxicity studies conducted in rats 
and NHPs, respectively, support long-term clinical dosing.  The repeat-dose toxicity study in rats 
included assessment of male fertility and early embryonic development.  ALN-AS1 was 
administered weekly at doses of 0, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg for up to 26 weeks.  Weekly doses of 
30 mg/kg resulted in adverse hepatocellular single cell necrosis and vacuolation in the liver, 
associated with mild increases in liver function tests (LFTs) at the conclusion of the dosing 
period.  Angiectasis was observed in the islets of Langerhans, possibly a secondary change to 
hepatic changes, which is not considered adverse.  Combined male fertility assessments did not 
indicate adverse reproductive or developmental findings up to the highest dose evaluated 
(30 mg/kg weekly SC dose).  In the 39-week repeat-dose toxicity study in NHP, ALN-AS1 was 
admi
nistered weekly at doses of 0, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg for up to 39 weeks.  Weekly doses of 
100 mg/kg were the lowest-observed-adverse-effect level based on single cell necrosis combined 
with inc
reased alanine transaminase (approximately 2-fold above control).  The NOAELs were 
10 mg/kg in the rat and 30 mg/kg in the NHP.  The 13-week recovery data in the rat and NHP 
studies is pending. 
1.3.2. Clinical Summary 
A
LN-AS1 is being investigated in an ongoing, Phase 1 study (ALN-AS1-001) to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ALN-AS1 
administered subcutaneously in patients with AIP.  The study is being conducted in 3 parts.  
Part A and Part B are single-blind, placebo-controlled portions of the study in patients with AIP 
who are
 ASHE.  Patients are randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either a single dose (Part A) or 
multiple doses (Part B; 2 doses 28 days apart) of ALN-AS1 or placebo.  Patients who participate 
in Part A and Part B are not eligible to participate in this study.  In Part C, patients with AIP who 
have recurrent porphyria attacks will receive multiple doses of ALN-AS1 dosing over a 12-week 
period in a r
andomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled part of the study.  This study will enroll 
patients who completed Part C of study ALN-AS1-001. 
Dosing has been completed in Part A (0.035-2.5 mg/kg) and Part B of the study 
(0.35-1.0 mg/kg).  A total of 23 unique patients with AIP who are ASHE have received at least 
1 dose of study drug (20 patients received at least 1 dose of ALN-AS1 and 3 patients received 
placebo only).  ALN-AS1 has been generally well-tolerated.  Adverse Events (AEs) in patients 
administered ALN-AS1, which were reported in 2 patients each, were abdominal pain, diarrhea, 
and hypoaesthesia in Part A; and nasopharyngitis, pruritus, and rash in Part B.  In Part A, AEs 
consi
dered possibly or definitely related to ALN-AS1 were reported in 5 patients:  diarrhea, 
dy
spepsia, haematochezia, injection site erythema, injection site pain, blood creatinine increased, 
glomerular filtration rate decreased, and hypoesthesia (1 patient each).  In Part B, AEs 
considered possibly or definitely related to ALN-AS1 were reported in 3 patients:  pruritus and 
534
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 1_ 10 November 2016 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   23 rash (2 patients each); and rash macular and rash pruritic (1 patient each).  There were 2 SAEs of 
abdominal pain in Part A, 1 patient each in the 0.035 mg/kg and 0.10 mg/kg dose groups, which 
were not considered to be related to study drug or due to AIP.  Across Part A and Part B, all AEs 
were mild or moderate in severity, except for 1 serious adverse event (SAE) of abdominal pain 
(0.10 mg
/kg dose group), which was considered severe.  There were no dose-related trends in 
AEs and no AEs leading to discontinuation.   
Overall, a dose-dependent reduction of urinary ALA and PBG as well as ALAS1 mRNA was 
observed following single and multiple doses of ALN-AS1.  Preliminary data demonstrate that 
administration of a single dose of ALN- AS1 at ≥1.0 mg/kg lowered ALA and PBG levels ≥80% 
and ALAS1 mRNA levels ≥50% when compared to baseline levels in patients with AIP who are 
ASHE.  Similarly, administration of multiple doses of ALN- AS1 at ≥0.35 mg/kg lowered ALA 
and PBG levels ≥80%.  ALAS1 mRNA levels were reduced ≥50% in the 1.0 mg/kg dose group 
when compared to baseline levels in patients with AIP who are ASHE.  ALA and PBG levels in 
the 1.0 mg/kg dose group in Part A were sustain ed for ≥180 days and in both dose groups in 
Part B for ≥160  days.  Specifically, the maximum mean reduction from baseline of urinary ALA 
and PBG reached 93% in the 2.5 mg/kg dose group, which were sustained for approximately 
14 weeks.  The maximum mean reduction in ALAS1 mRNA relative to baseline of 66% was 
demons
trated in the 2.5 mg/kg dose group which was maintained beyond 42 days. 
Cumulatively, nonclinical and clinical data to date support long-term administration of 
ALN-AS1 in patients with AIP. 
1.4. Study Design Rationale 
This is a multicenter, open-label extension study designed to evaluate the long-term safety and 
clinical activity of subcutaneously administered ALN-AS1 in patients with AIP who have 
completed clinical study ALN-AS1-001.  The primary endpoint for the study is the incidence of 
AEs. 
1.5. Dose Rationale 
Clinical data from Part A and Part B of the ongoing study ALN-AS1-001 demonstrate that single 
(0.035-2.5 mg/kg) and multiple (0.35-1.0 mg/kg) doses of ALN-AS1 have been generally 
well-tolerated in patients with AIP who are ASHE.  Additionally, data from this study indicate 
that a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg ALN-AS1 results in near normalization of urine ALA and PBG 
levels, which is sustained for approximately 14 weeks.   
Pa
tients in Part C of the ongoing study ALN-AS1-001 who are eligible for participation in this 
study
 will likely require a higher dose of ALN-AS1 to normalize ALA and PBG as they have 
higher levels of ALAS1 upregulation and higher baseline levels of ALA and PBG, when 
compared to patients with AIP who are ASHE. [30]  For example, based on preliminary data in 
Pa
rt A and Part B of the ALN-AS1-001 study, the mean PBG level of patients who are ASHE is 
21.9 mmol/mol Cr (N=28); whereas, in Part C of this study in patients with AHP who have 
recurrent porphyria attacks, the mean PBG level is approximately 49.3 mmol/mol Cr (N=12). 
The stud
y starting dose and regimen of ALN-AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg as an SC injection administered 
eve
ry 3 months.  Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may approve changes to the 
ALN-AS1 dosing regimen, including decreases in the dose level and changes in dosing 
535
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 1_ 10 November 2016 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   24 frequency.  However, any dosing regimen will not exceed a previously explored dose level or 
frequency that was determined to be safe and well-tolerated in study ALN-AS1-001.  SRC, 
Health Authority and Ethics Committee approval must be sought prior to dose level escalation 
above 5.0 mg/kg in accordance with local Regulatory requirements. 
The study starting dose and regimen was selected based on the benefit:risk profile of ALN-AS1 
in Pa
rt C of the ongoing ALN-AS1-001 study.  Preliminary data to date indicate that 
administration of 5.0 mg/kg ALN-AS1 has been generally well-tolerated.  There have been no 
study drug-related SAEs, severe AEs, or clinically significant changes in safety parameters.  
While a single 2.5 mg/kg dose of ALN-AS1 has also been generally well-tolerated when 
administered to patients in Part A and Part C of study ALN-AS1-001, this dose has not resulted 
in near nor
malization of ALA and PBG levels.  In addition, while emerging data from Part C 
indic
ate that an every 3 months dose of 2.5 mg/kg ALN-AS1 demonstrated some clinical activity 
(eg, decrease in attack frequency and decrease in heme use), some patients continued to 
experience breakthrough porphyria attacks during the treatment period, indicating that a higher 
dose may be required. 
The duration of dosing in this study is supported by the overall favorable safety profile of 
ALN-AS1 in the ongoing clinical study ALN-AS1-001 and the absence of new findings in 
nonclinical studies with ALN-AS1. 
1.6. Benefit-Risk Assessment 
Patients participating in this study may experience a reduced number or severity of porphyria 
attacks, reduced treatment with IV hemin, and/or reduced requirement for pain medication. 
The potential risks associated with administration of ALN-AS1 in patients with AIP are as 
follows: 
 Injection site reactions (ISRs):  ALN-AS1 is administered by SC injection.  In the 
ong
oing ALN-AS1 clinical study, AEs of ISRs have been infrequently reported and 
have been mild to moderate in severity with single dosing.  Injection site rotation and 
close monitoring have been implemented in ALN-AS1 clinical studies to reduce the 
potential for ISRs.  
 Liver function test abnormalities:  As ALN-AS1 is targeted for delivery to the liver, 
and reversible hepatic changes were observed in some animal species, there is a 
potential for
 development of LFT abnormalities.  To minimize the potential for LFT 
abnormalities, patients are required to have adequate liver function at study entry and 
LFTs are monitored during the study. 
 Reproductive health:  No data are available on the use of ALN-AS1 in pregnancy; 
however, there is no suspicion of human teratogenicity based on class effects or 
genotoxic potential.  ALN-AS1 was neither genotoxic nor clastogenic in in vitro and 
in vivo studies.  Based on preliminary data from rat fertility/embryofetal development 
and rabbit embryofetal development studies, it is unlikely that ALN-AS1 
admi
nistration to pregnant women poses a risk to embryofetal development.  In a rat 
fertility/embryofetal development study at daily dose levels up to 16.5 mg/kg, no test 
article-related effects on female fertility or developmental endpoints were observed.  
In a rabbit embryofetal development study, maternal toxicity was observed at daily 
536

Amendment 1_ 10 November 2016 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   25 doses of >3  mg/kg (7.8-fold higher than the clinical monthly dose of 5.0 mg/kg).  No 
terata were observed in this range finding embryo fetal development study.  Women 
of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test, cannot be 
breastfeeding, and must be willing to use acceptable methods of contraception during 
studie
s with ALN-AS1.  
 CYP inhibition:  A study in NHP demonstrated that ALN-AS1 dosing could 
potentiall
y increase the clearance of drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isoform.  As 
contraceptive hormones are metabolized via CYP3A, WOCBP must use a barrier 
method of contraception, in addition to hormonal contraception, during study 
participation.  Additionally, Investigators will review all patient medications at study 
start and monitor responses to these medications during the study.  A list of 
medications that are sensitive CYP3A substrates is in Table 6 in Appe ndix 
S
ection  11.3.  In addition, a list of medications that are sensitive CYP3A substrates is 
ava
ilable at the Indiana University, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, website. [31]

4.1. Summary of Study Design 
This is a Phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label extension study to evaluate the long-term safety and 
clinical activity of ALN-AS1 in patients with AIP who completed study ALN-AS1-001.  The 
study will be conducted at up to 8 clinical study centers worldwide. 
The last a
ssessments performed, determining previous study (ALN-AS1-001) completion, will 
serve as the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed 
since the last assessment, safety assessments (eg, ECG and clinical laboratory tests) will be 
repeated before administration of ALN-AS1.  It is anticipated that patients will begin ALN-AS1 
administration in this study within 6 months after the last dose of study drug in the previous 
study.  Eligibility will be confirmed during Screening/Baseline and before administration of the 
first dos
e of ALN-AS1 (Day 1).  Patients will undergo assessments at the clinical study center 
eve
ry month for the first 3 months.  Then, through Month 6, and according to the dosing regimen 
selected, assessments will take place at the clinical study center or via a phone contact (for an 
every month dosing regimen, visits will be every month; for an every 3 months dosing regimen, 
visits will be every 3 months; see Section  6.2.2).  After a patient has completed 12 months of 
ALN-AS1 administration in this study (6 months in an every month dosing regimen), and where 
applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, study visits and ALN-AS1 
administrat ion may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional (as indicated in 
the Schedules of Assessments in  Table 1 a nd Table 2; and Table 4 a nd Ta ble 5 in Appe ndix 
Section  11.2) .  Home  visi ts may occur at the discretion of the Investigator, based on safety and 
tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical study center 
eve
ry 3 months for the first year, and thereafter every 6 months through the end of the treatment 
period.  P
atients will return to the clinical study center for a posttreatment follow-up visit after 
administration of the last dose of ALN-AS1.  An ALA/PBG Monitoring/EOS visit will be 
conduc
ted either at the clinical study center or via phone contact, unless treatment continues with 
ALN-AS1.

ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 1_ 10 November 2016 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   27 Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain 
assessments, and narcotic use.  Additionally, patients will be encouraged to report to the clinical 
study center if they experience a porphyria attack through Month 39.  In the event that patients 
are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laboratory sample 
coll
ection kits containing instructions for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical 
study center, if possible, will be provided.  Patients will be contacted by phone after a porphyria 
attack to record attack details.  If patients are experiencing signs and symptoms of a porphyria 
attack when ALN-AS1 administration is scheduled, the Investigator will determine whether 
administration of ALN-AS1 is appropriate.  If patients are treated for a porphyria attack at a 
health care facility (eg, hospital, emergency department, infusion center, or outpatient clinic) 
other than the clinical study center, copies of medical records, including discharge summaries, 
will be requested.   
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review safety and tolerability data collected during the 
study with the primary purpose of protecting the safety of patients participating in the study (see 
Section  4.6).

ALN-AS1  Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 1_ 10 November 2016 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 30 6. TREATMENTS 
6.1. Treatments Administered 
ALN-AS1 Solution for Injection (SC use) is a clear, colorless to pale yellow solution essentially 
free of particulates.  ALN-AS1 will be supplied by the Sponsor as a sterile solution for SC 
injection. 
Study drug supplied for this study must not be used for any purpose other than the present study 
and must not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study.  Study drug that has been 
dispensed to a patient and returned unused must not be re-dispensed to a different patient. 
6.2. Investigational Study Drug 
Detailed information describing the preparation, handling, and storage, packaging and labeling, 
as well as study drug accountability for ALN-AS1 is provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
6.2.1. Description 
A
LN-AS1 Solution for Injection (SC use) is comprised of a synthetic, siRNA targeting ALAS1 
and bearing a triantennary GalNAc ligand conjugated to the sense strand, formulated in 
phosphate buffer.  
6.2.2. Dose and Adm inistr ation 
The study starting dose of ALN-AS1 i s 5.0 mg/kg ALN-AS1 as an SC injection administered 
every 3 mont hs (Table 1 and Table 2) . B ased on emerging clinical da ta, the SRC may approve 
changes to the ALN-AS1 dosing regimen, including decreases in the dose level and changes in 
dosing frequency (Table 4 and Table 5 in Appendix Section  11.2). However, any dose and 
dosing regime n will not exceed a previously explored dose level or frequency that wa
s 
determined to be safe and we
ll-tolerated in study ALN-AS1-001. SRC, Health Authority and 
Ethics Committee approval must be sought prior to dose level escalation above 5.0 mg/kg in 
accordance with local Regulatory requirements.  See Section 6.2.3 for details on dose 
modifications. 
The study drug will be administered under the supervision of a healthcare professi
onal.  After a 
patient has completed 12 months of ALN-AS1 administration in this study (6 months in an every 
month dosing regimen), and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure 
all
ow, study visits and ALN- AS1 administration may take place at the patient’s home by a 
healthcare professional.  Home visits may occur at the discretion of the Investigator, based on 
safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical 
study center every 3 months for the first year, and thereafter every 6 months through the end of 
the treatment period.   
If a patient does not receive a dose of ALN-AS1 within the specified dosing window, the 
Inv
estigator should contact the Medical Monitor.  After such consultation, the dose may be 
administered or considered missed and not administered. 
Patients will be permitted to miss an occasional dose of study drug; however, if a patient misses 
2 consecutive doses, the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, will discuss 
whether the patient will be able to continue on the study.  
542
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 1_ 10 November 2016 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   31 Detailed instructions for study drug administration are found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
6.2.3.  Dose Modifications 
6.2.3.1. Study Population Dose Modifications 
During the study, dose modifications are permitted for the study population, or based on the dose 
cohort into which patients were originally randomized in study ALN-AS1-001.  Following SRC 
review of emerging safety and tolerability data from Part C of study ALN-AS1-001, or from this 
study (ALN-AS1-002), the dose and dosing regimen may be modified.  However, the dose and 
dosing regimen of ALN-AS1 will not exceed a previously explored dose and dosing regimen that 
was determined to be safe and well-tolerated in study ALN-AS1-001.  Patients enrolling in this 
study after a dose modification decision has been implemented may start at the newly identified 
dose and regimen. 
6.2.3.2. Individual Dose Modifications 
Dose modi
fications are permitted for individual patients.  If a patient has a study drug related AE 
of a recurrent ISR, severe ISR, or clinically significant LFT abnormality and the Investigator has 
conc
erns regarding further ALN-AS1 administration, the Medical Monitor and Investigator will 
review all available safety data for the patient.  Based on this review, a dose reduction to half the 
pre
viously administered dose (eg, a 5.0 mg/kg dose would be reduced to a 2.5 mg/kg dose) or a 
reduction in dosing frequency from monthly to every 3 months is permitted.  Subsequent 
AL
N-AS1 administration at the previous dose may be considered based on the judgment of the 
Inv
estigator and Medical Monitor. 
6.2.4. Preparation, Handling, and Storage 
S
taff at each clinical study center or the home healthcare professional will be responsible for 
pre
paration of ALN-AS1 doses, according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy Manual.  No 
special procedures for the safe handling of study drug are required. 
Study drug will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately 5±3°C.  Any deviation from 
the re
commended storage conditions should be reported to the Sponsor and use of the study drug 
halted until authorization for its continued use has been provided by the Sponsor or designee. 
A Sponsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, 
storage, dispensing procedures, and records. 
6.2.5. Packaging and Labeling 
A
LN-AS1 Solution for Injection (SC use) is packaged in 2 mL glass vials with a fill volume of 
no less than 0.55 mL.  The container closure system consists of a Type I glass vial, a Teflon 
fac
ed bromobutyl 13 mm stopper and a flip-off Truedge aluminum seal. 
6.2.6. Accountability 
The
 Investigator or designee will maintain accurate records of receipt and the condition of the 
study drug supplied for this study, including dates of receipt.  In addition, accurate records will 
be kept of when and how much study drug is dispensed and administered to each patient in the 
study.  Any reasons for departure from the protocol dispensing regimen must also be recorded. 
543
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 1_ 10 November 2016 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   32 At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of all study drugs.  All used, 
partially used, and unused study drug will be returned to the Sponsor (or designee) or destroyed 
at the clinical study center according to applicable regulations.   
6.3. Concomitant Medications 
Use of concomitant medications will be recorded on the patient’s case report form (CRF) as 
indicated in the Schedules of Assessments ( Table 1 a nd Ta ble 2; and Table 4 a nd Table 5 in 
Appendix Section  11.2).  T his includes all prescription medications, herbal preparations, over the 
c
ounter (OTC) medications, vitamins, and minerals.  Any changes in medications during the 
study will also be recorded on the CRF. 
Any concomitant medication that is required for the patient’s welfare may be administered by the 
Investigator.  However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding 
the medication are recorded on the eCRF.  Concomitant medication will be coded using an 
internationally recognized and accepted coding dictionary. 
ALN-AS1 could potentially increase the clearance of drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isoform.   
Investigators will review all medications at study start and monitor response to these medications 
during the study.  For patients who require new medications while on study, selection of 
medications that are not mainly metabolized by the CYP3A isoform is recommended.  A list of 
medications that are sensitive CYP3A substrates is included in Table 6 Ap pendix Section  11.3.  
In 
addition, a more detailed and current list of sensitive CYP3A-metabolized medications and 
CYP3A-metabolized medications with a narrow therapeutic range is available at the Indiana 
University, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, website 
(http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/clinical-table/). [31] 
Pa
tients are not permitted to be on hemin prophylaxis at Screening; however, patients are 
permitted to receive concomitant hemin treatment for the management of acute porphyria 
attacks.  Patients experiencing significant breakthrough attacks while enrolled in this study, 
necessitating frequent hemin treatment, may receive hemin prophylaxis if in the Investigator’s 
judgment this is clinically beneficial to the patient.  The Investigator should contact with the 
Sponsor and Medical Monitor before prophylactic hemin treatment.  The dose, regimen, and 
dates of administration will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF.   
Pain medication (eg, opiates, opioids, narcotic analgesics) and glucose administration are 
permitted for the management of porphyria and for acute porphyria attacks. 
If patients use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications intermittently or chronically, they 
must have been able to tolerate them with no previous side effects (eg, gastric distress or 
bleeding).  
 
Standard vitamins and topical medications are permitted; however, topical steroids must not be 
applied anywhere near the injection site(s) unless medically indicated. 
6.4. Contraceptive Requirements 
WOCBP must be willing to use acceptable methods of contraception 14 days before first dose, 
throughout s
tudy participation, and for 90 days after last dose administration.  Birth control 
methods which ma
y be considered as acceptable include: 
544
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 1_ 10 November 2016 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   33  Established use of oral,  implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal methods of 
contraception.  WOCBP using hormonal methods of contraception must also use a 
barrier method (condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault cap] in 
conjunction with spermicide [eg, foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository]).  If 
hormonal methods of contraception are medically contraindicated for WOCBP due to 
underlying disease, a double-barrier method (combination of male condom with 
either cap, diaphragm, or sponge, in conjunction with spermicide) is also considered 
an acceptable method of contraception. 
 Placement of an intrauterine device  
 Placement of an intrauterine hormone-releasing system  

 Bilateral tubal occlusion 

 Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post-vasectomy 
doc
umentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the 
study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient) 
 True sexual abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
pa
tient.  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation 
methods) and withdra
wal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  Abstinent 
patients must agree to use 1 of the abovementioned contraceptive methods, if they 
start sexual relationships during the study and for 90 days after last dose 
administration. 
WOCBP includes any female patient who has experienced menarche and who is not 
postmenopausal or permanently sterilized (eg, bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, or 
bilateral salpingectomy).  Postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without 
an alternative medical cause, confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone level within the 
postmenopausal range. 
6.5. Treatment Compliance 
Compliance with study drug administration will be verified through observation by study 
personnel or trained home healthcare professionals.  
7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
The schedule of study assessments is provided in Table 1.  
7.1. Screening/Baseline Assessments 
Informed consent, patient demographic data, and eligibility criteria will be confirmed at 
Screening/Baseline.  An interval medical history/disease history will be obtained at 
Screening/Baseline.  The last assessments performed, determining previous study 
(ALN-AS1-001) completion, will serve as the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If 
more than 60 days have elapsed since the last assessment, clinical laboratory tests and ECGs will 
be repeated before administration of ALN-AS1. 
545
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 1_ 10 November 2016 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   34 7.2. Clinical Activity Assessments 
The clinical activity of ALN-AS1 will be assessed by the frequency and characteristics of 
porphyria attacks including, but not limited to, duration, treatment, and severity of porphyria 
attacks and number and duration of visits to a health care setting for acute porphyria care (eg, 
hospital, emergency department, infusion center, or outpatient clinic).  Concomitant hemin 
administration will also be recorded. 
7.2.1. Patient Diary 
P
atients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain 
assessments, and narcotic use. 
7.2.2.  Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form Questionnaire 
The Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) questionnaire will be used to evaluate pain. [32]  
The B
PI will be completed as part of the patient diary. 
7.3. Pharmacodynamic Assessments 
Blood and urine samples will be collected for assessment of ALN-AS1 PD parameters.  The PD 
effect of ALN-AS1 will be evaluated by urine ALA and PBG levels.  Blood and urine samples 
will be collected for assessment of circulating ALAS1 mRNA levels in serum and in urine.  
Analysis for blood and urine PD parameters will take place at a central laboratory.   
Details regarding the processing and aliquoting of samples for storage and analyses will be 
provided in the 
Laboratory Manual. 
7.4. Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate the PK profile of ALN-AS1 at the time points in the 
Schedule of Assessments.  A detailed schedule of time points for the collection of blood samples 
for PK analysis is in Table 3 in Appe ndix Section  11.1 ). 
The
 concentration of ALN-AS1 will be determined using a validated assay.  Details regarding 
the processing, shipping, and analysis of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
7.5. Safety Assessments 
The assessment of safety during the course of the study will consist of the surveillance and 
recording of AEs including SAEs, recording of concomitant medications and measurements of 
vital signs, physical examination, and ECG findings and clinical laboratory evaluations. 
Safety will be monitored over the course of the study by an SRC as described in Section  4.6. 
7.5.1. Vital Sign s 
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory 
rate.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be consistent for each 
pati
ent), after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  Blood pressure should be taken 
using the same arm throughout the study.  Body temperature will be obtained in degrees Celsius, 
546

Amendment 1_ 10 November 2016 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   35 heart rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in beats per minute, and respiration rate 
will be counted for a full minute and recorded in breaths per minute. 
For the safety of the patient, additional vital sign assessments may be added at the discretion of 
the Investigator. 
7.5.2.  Weight and Height 
Height will be measured in centimeters at the Screening/Baseline visit only.  Body weight will be 
measured in kilograms.  Body mass index will be calculated in the database. 
7.5.3. Physical Examination 
C
omplete physical examinations will include the examination of the following:  general 
appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, chest/respiratory, heart/cardiovascular, 
gastrointestinal/liver, musculoskeletal/extremities, dermatological/skin, thyroid/neck, lymph 
nodes, and neurological/psychiatric. 
Targeted physical examinations will include the examination of the following:  general 
appearance, chest/respiratory, heart/cardiovascular, gastrointestinal/liver, and 
neurological/psychiatric. 
7.5.4. Electrocardiogram 
Tr
iplicate 12-lead ECG, with readings approximately 2 minutes apart, will be recorded.  
Additional ECGs may be collected at the discretion of the Investigator.  Standard computerized 
12-lead ECG recordings will be obtained.  Each lead shall be recorded for at least 3 beats at a 
speed of 2
5 mm/s.  Recordings will be obtained, after the patient has rested comfortably for 
approximately 10 minutes.  The e
lectrophysiological parameters assessed include rhythm, 
ventricular rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, ST and T waves, Bazett-corrected QT 
interval (QTcB) and Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF). 
The Investigator or designee is responsible for reviewing the ECGs to assess whether the results 
have changed since the Screening/Baseline visit and to determine the clinical relevance of the 
results.  These assessments will be recorded on the eCRF.  For any clinically relevant ECG 
changes from the Screening/Baseline visit (eg, ischemic ECG changes, wave/interval changes, or 
arrhythmia), the Investigator must contact the Medical Monitor to discuss continued participation 
of the patient in the study. 
7.5.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
The
 following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory.  In the event of 
an unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study drug 
administration, the test should be repeated and followed up at the discretion of the Investigator 
until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis is made to adequately 
explain the abnormality.

A pregnancy test will be performed for WOCBP only.  A serum pregnancy test will be 
performed at Screening/Baseline and urine pregnancy tests will be performed thereafter per the 
Schedule of Assessments and any time pregnancy is suspected.  Urine pregnancy tests may also 
be performed more frequently (eg, monthly) based on local country requirements.  The results of 
the pregnancy test must be known before study drug administration.  Patients who are pregnant 
are not eligible for study participation.  Any woman with a positive pregnancy test during the 
study will be discontinued from study drug, but will continue to be followed for safety.  Patients 
determined to be pregnant while on study will be followed until the pregnancy outcome is known 
(see Section 7.5.6.6  for follow-up instructions).  
7.5.6. Adverse Events 
7.5.6.1.
 Definitions 
Adverse Event 
According to the ICH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 
21 Code of Federal Regulations 312.32, Investigational New Drug Safety Reporting, an AE is 
an
y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational subject administered a 
medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 Results in death 

 Is life-threatening (An event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the 
event as it occurred.  It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more 
severe form might have caused death) 
 Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 

 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above (eg, 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug 
dependency or abuse). 
549
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 1_ 10 November 2016 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   38 Adverse Event Severity 
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below: 
Mild:  Mild events are those which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal 
daily activity.  
Moderate:  Moderate events are those which cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with 
normal d aily activities.  
Severe:  Severe events are those which incapacitate and prevent usual activity.  
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity.  AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of the start and stop of each incidence.  When changes in the severity of an AE 
occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day should 
be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be 
rec
orded separately (with distinct onset dates) 
AE severity and seriousness are assessed independently.  ‘Severity’ characterizes the intensity of 
an AE.  ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for Serious Adverse Event). 
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Treatment 
The relationship of each AE to study treatment should be evaluated by the Investigator using the 
following criteria:  
Definitely related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to the medication administration, and which 
cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or c hemicals.  
The response to withdrawal of the drug should be clinically plausible.  
Possibly related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to the medication administration, but which 
could also be explaine d by concurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals.  Information on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or 
unclear.  
Unlikely related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no 
temporal relationship to medication administra tion, and which other 
drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations.  
Not related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality that has no 
temporal relationship to the medication or has more likely alternative 
etiology.  
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest 
The following events are considered to be adverse events of clinical interest: 
 ISRs 
550
ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 1_ 10 November 2016 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   39  Hepatic AEs, including LFT abnormalities considered clinically significant by the 
Investigator . 
7.5.6.2. Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events 
Eliciting Adverse Events 
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last 
visit.  The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospitalized, had any accidents, used 
any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC).  
In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant 
laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are 
relevant to patient safety. 
Rec
ording Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for recording non-serious AEs that are observed or reported by 
the patient after administration of the first dose of study drug regardless of their relationship to 
study drug through the end of study.  Non-serious AEs will be followed until the end of study.  
The 
Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by the patient 
after the time when the informed consent is signed regardless of their relationship to study drug 
through the end of study.  SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until baseline level 
is reached, or until the SAE is considered by the Investigator to be chronic or the patient is 
stable, as appropriate. 
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for 
the patient, whether or not they are considered to be drug-related.  Each AE must be described in 
detail:  onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to investigational drug, 
action taken, and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
For SAEs, record the event(s) on the eCRF.  If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is 
unavailable, complete the backup SAE form. 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest, additional clinical information may be 
collected based upon the severity or nature of the event. 
If a patient has ISRs meeting any of the following criteria, the Investigator or delegate should 
contact the Medical Monitor and submit a supplemental ISR eCRF: 
 ISRs that are recurrent and/or demonstrate a pattern of increasing severity 
 Any ISR that is determined to be severe and/or a cause for study drug discontinuation  
 Any ISR which, in the opinion of the Investigator, requires further medical evaluation or 
treatment 
In some cases, where it is medically appropriate, further evaluation may include photographs, 
referral to a dermatologist, skin biopsy, or other laboratory testing.  If a biopsy was obtained, the 
Sponsor may request that the biopsy also be reviewed by a central dermatopathologist.  To better 
understand the safety profile of the study drug, additional analysis of biopsy tissue may be 
performed according to local regulations.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   40 For patients with hepatic AEs, additional information, including, clinical history, course of event, 
and local laboratory results to monitor LFT levels or other laboratory parameters, may be 
collected. 
7.5.6.3. Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee 
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by the Investigator.  Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section 7.5.6.1 must  be reported to the 
S
ponsor or designee within 24 hours from the time that clinical study center personnel first 
learns of the event.  All SAEs must be reported regardless of the relationship to study drug. 
The initial report should include at least the following information: 
 Patient’s study number  

 Description and date of onset of the event 

 Criterion for serious 

 Preliminary assignment of relationship to study drug 

 Investigator/clinical study center information 
To r
eport the SAE, complete the eCRF.  If the EDC system is unavailable, complete the backup 
SAE form.  Within 24 hours of receipt of follow-up information, the Investigator must update the 
report.  SAEs must be reported using the contact information provided in the Study Manual. 
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken by the Investigator using his/her best medical 
judgment t o treat the SAE.  These measures and the patient’s response to these measures should 
be recorded.  All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be followed by the 
Investigator until satisfactory resolution or the Investigator deems the SAE to be chronic or 
stable.  Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed by the Investigator as 
needed to adequately determine the etiology of the event. 
7.5.6.4. Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities 
The Sponsor or its representative is required to report certain study events in an expedited 
manner to the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency’s EudraVigilance 
electronic system according to Directive 2001/20/EC, and to all country Regulatory Authorities 
where the study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations. 
The following describes the safety reporting timeline requirements for suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) and other reportable events: 
Immediately and within 7 calendar days 
 Any suspected adverse reaction that is associated with the use of the study drug, 
unexpected, and fatal or life threatening.  Follow-up information must be reported in 
the following 8 days.

ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 1_ 10 November 2016 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential   41 Immediately and within 15 calendar days 
 Any suspected adverse reaction that is associated with the use of the study drug, 
une
xpected, and serious, but not fatal or life threatening, and there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the reaction. 
 Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggest a significant risk for human 
pa
tients including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity. 
 Any event in connection with the conduct of the study or the development of the 
stud
y drug that may affect the safety of the trial patients. 
In addition, periodic safety reporting to regulatory authorities will be performed by the Sponsor 
or its representative according to national and local regulations. 
7.5.6.5. Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
SUSARs will be reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) per their institutional policy by the Investigator or Sponsor (or Sponsor 
designee) according to country requirements.  Copies of each report and documentation of 
IRB/IEC notification and acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator’s study 
file. 
7.5.6.6. Pregnancy Reporting 
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the course of this study through 90 days following 
the last dose of study drug, the Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee 
within 24 hours of being notified of the pregnancy.  Details of the pregnancy will be recorded on 
the pre
gnancy reporting form.  The patient should receive any necessary counseling regarding 
the risks of continuing the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. 
The pregnancy should be followed by the Investigator until completion.  At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy.  If the outcome of the 
pregnancy results in a postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
or congenital anomaly, then the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE 
as outlined in Section 7.5.6.3 .   
7.5.6.7. Overdose Reporting 
An overdose is defined as any dose administered to or taken by a patient (accidentally or 
intentionally) that exceeds the highest daily dose, or is at a higher frequency, than included in the 
protocol.  It is up to the investigator to decide whether a dose is to be considered an overdose, in 
consultation with the Sponsor.  Overdose must be recorded in the eCRF. 
All reports of overdose (with or without an AE) must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor 
or designee.

ALN-AS1      Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 1_1 0 November 2016  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential      54 c See Section  7.1 for details on the interval medical history/disease history to be recorded at Screening/Baseline.  Ongoing AEs from the previous study 
(ALN-AS1-001) will be captured as medical history. 
d A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening/Baseline, and D1.  At all other visits, a targeted physical examination will be performed.  On 
dosing days, the physical examination will be performed predose.  On days when ALN-AS1 is not administered, the physical examination can occur at any time 
during the visit.  See Section  7.5.3  for details on the physical examination. 
e Height will be measured at Screening/Baseline only. 
f Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate.  On D1, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose; and 2 hours 
(±10 minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose.  On days when ALN-AS1 is not administered, vital signs 
can be collected at any time during the visit.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be consistent for each patient), after the 
patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes. 
g Triplicate 12-lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine position after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  On D1, ECGs will be 
performed within 1 hour predose and 2 hours (±10 minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, ECGs will be collected within 1 hour predose. 
h Clinical laboratory parameters are described in Section  7.5.5 .  On dosing days, blood samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected within 1 hour 
predose; results are not required before dosing.  On days when ALN-AS1 is not administered, blood samples can be collected at any time during the visit. 
i A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening/Baseline; thereafter, urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  Results must be available before dosing. 
j ALN-AS1 will be administered by SC injection according to the Pharmacy Manual.  See Section  6.2.2  for ALN-AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  For weight-
based dosing, weight measured on the dosing day will be used to calculate the dose of ALN-AS1.  After M12, weight measured on the nearest previous visit 
will be used to calculate the weight-based dose of ALN-AS1. 
k Spot urine samples will be collected for measurement of ALA, PBG, and creatinine levels.  On dosing days, samples should be collected predose. 
l On dosing days, blood and urine samples for ALAS1 mRNA (and possible biomarker) analysis will be collected within 1 hour predose. 
m Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points listed in  Table 3  (Appendix Section  11.1). 
n On dosing days, blood samples for antidrug antibody analysis should be collected within 1 hour predose. 
o Porphyria attack laboratory sample collection kits should be dispensed at the screening visit along with instructions for use. For any attack that occurs through 
M39, urine samples should be collected within 24 hours of the start of clinical intervention (eg, hemin or glucose administration) and within 24 hours of the end 
of clinical intervention.   If patients are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack, laboratory sample collection kits should be used 
fo
r collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center, if possible.  These urine samples may also be analyzed for exploratory biomarkers. 
p In addition to the time points indicated, the EQ- 5D-5L questionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a porphyria attack 
(but not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible.  
q Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain assessments, and narcotic use on a daily basis through M9; 
thereafter, acute porphyria attacks will be recorded in the diary.  The BPI will be completed on a weekly basis as part of the patient diary through M9, then 
Q3M. 
r Medications that are ongoing from the previous study (ALN-AS1-001), started between the previous study and this study, and started after signing informed 
consent in this study, will be captured as concomitant medication(s).

ALN-AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
Amendment 1 Summary of Changes_ 10 November 2016 
 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 1 ALN-AS1-002 Protocol Amendment 1 
Summary of Changes (dated 10 November 2016 )  
compared to Original Protocol (dated 19 July 2016) 
 
A Multicenter, Open-label Extension Study to Evaluate the Long-term Safety and Clinical 
Activity of Subcutaneously Administered ALN-AS1 in Patients with Acute Intermittent 
Porphyria who have Completed a Previous Clinical Study with ALN-AS1 
 
Rationale for Protocol Amendment 
The primary purpose of this protocol amendment is to define the starting dose in study 
ALN-AS1-002, and to clarify criteria f
or determining individual dose modifications.  
The following changes are being implemented as outlined: 
 Based on review of data from the ALN-AS1-001 study, the SRC has determined the 
study starting dose and dosing regime
n for administration in ALN-AS1-002 to be 
5.0 mg/kg administered every 3 months.  
 If a patient has a study drug-related adverse event (AE) of a recurrent injection site 
reaction (ISR), severe I
SR, or clinically significant liver function test (LFT) abnormality 
and the Investigator and Medical Monitor have concerns regarding further ALN-AS1 
administration, a dose reduction to half the previously administered dose or a reduction in 
dosing frequency will be permitted. Subsequent ALN-AS1 administration at the previous 
dose may be considered based on the judgment of the Investigator and Medical Monitor. 
 The benefit-risk profile remains unchanged; however, the potential risks associated with 
administration of ALN-AS1 in patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) on 
reproductive health were updated to include preliminary nonclinical data.  Based on these 
data, ALN-AS1 administration to pregnant women is unlikely to pose a risk to 
embryofetal development.   
 While contraceptive requirements for patients enrolling in study ALN-AS1-002 remain 
unchanged from those in study ALN-AS1-
001, wording of the inclusion criterion for 
WOCBP was clarified such that if hormonal methods of contraception are medically 
contraindicated, a double-barrier method will be considered an acceptable method of 
contraception.  
 Since ALN-AS1 could increase the clearance of drugs metabolized by the CYP3A 
isoform, a lis
t of medications that are CYP3A substrates is now included in the protocol. 
 To support dosing for up to 36-months, preliminary nonc linical data from 26-week and 
39-week Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) chronic toxicity studies conducted in rats and 
nonhuman primates (NHPs) have been updated. 
 Clarified that a single blood sample for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis will be collected 
at the Month 1 visit for patients with an every
 3 month dosing regimen

Amendment 1 Summary of Changes_ 10 November 2016 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 3 Table 1: Protocol Amendment 1 Detailed Summary of Changes 
The primary section(s) of the protocol affected by the changes in the protocol amendment are indicated.  The corresponding text has 
been revised throughout the protocol.  Deleted text is indicated by strikeout; added text is indicated by bold  font. 
Purpose:  Updated preliminary nonclinical data from 26 -week and 39 -week GLP chronic toxicity studies conducted in rats and NHPs  
The primary change occurs in Section 1.3.1, Nonclinical Summary  
Added text: Preliminary results from 26 -week and 39 -week GLP chronic toxicity studies conducted in rats and NHPs, 
respectively, support long -term clinical dosing.  The repeat -dose toxicity study in rats included assessment of male 
fertility and early embryonic d evelopment.  ALN -AS1 was administered weekly at doses of 0, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg for 
up to 26 weeks.  Weekly doses of 30 mg/kg resulted in adverse hepatocellular single cell necrosis and vacuolation in 
the liver, associated with mild increases in liver funct ion tests (LFTs) at the conclusion of the dosing period.  
Angiectasis was observed in the islets of Langerhans, possibly a secondary change to hepatic changes, which is not 
considered adverse.  Combined male fertility assessments did not indicate adverse r eproductive or developmental 
findings up to the highest dose evaluated (30 mg/kg weekly SC dose).  In the 39 -week repeat -dose toxicity study in 
NHP, ALN -AS1 was administered weekly at doses of 0, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg for up to 39 weeks.  Weekly doses of 
100 mg/kg were the lowest -observed -adverse -effect level based on single cell necrosis combined with increased 
alanine transaminase (approximately 2 -fold above control).  The NOAELs were 10 mg/kg in the rat and 30 mg/kg 
in the NHP.  The 13 -week recovery data in the rat and NHP studies is pending.  
Section(s) also containing this change:  
Section 1.5, Dose Rationale
Purpose:  Specified the starting dose level and frequency for administration in study ALN -AS1-002 as 5.0 mg/kg every 3 months and a dded 
preliminary clinical data from study ALN -AS1-001 supporting this starting dose level and frequency  
The primary change occurs in Section 1.5, Dose Rationale  
Added text  The study starting dose and regimen of ALN -AS1 is 5.0 mg/kg as an SC injection administered every 3 months.  
Based on emerging clinical data, the SRC may approve changes to the ALN -AS1 dos ing regimen, including 
decreases in the dose level and changes in do sing frequency.  However, any dose and dosing regimen will not 
exceed a previously explored dose level or frequency  that was determined to be safe and well -tolerated in study 
ALN -AS1-001. SRC, Health Authority and Ethics Committee approval must be sought p rior to dose level 
escalation above 5.0 mg/kg in accordance with local Regulatory requirements.  
The study starting dose and regimen was selected based on the benefit:risk profile of ALN -AS1 in Part C of the 
ongoing ALN AS1 001 study.  Preliminary data to d ate indicate that administration of 5.0 mg/kg ALN AS1 has 
been generally well -tolerated.  There have been no study drug related SAEs, severe AEs, or clinically significant 
changes in safety parameters.  While a single 2.5 mg/kg dose of ALN -AS1 has also bee n generally well -tolerated 
573
ALN-AS1 Clinical Study Protocol ALN-AS1- 002 
 Amendment 1 Summary of Changes_ 10 November 2016 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 4 when administered to patients in Part A and Part C of study ALN -AS1-001, this dose has not resulted in near 
normalization of ALA and PBG levels.  In addition, while emerging data from Part C indicate that an every 3 
months dose o f 2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1 demonstrated some clinical activity (eg, decrease in attack frequency and 
decrease in heme use), some patients continued to experience breakthrough porphyria attacks during the 
treatment period, indicating that a higher dose may be requ ired.

 Synopsis  
 Section 6.2.2, Dose and Administration  
Purpose:  Updated potential risks associated with administration of ALN -AS1 on reproductive health to include preliminary nonclinical data

Now reads:  Reproductive health: No data are available on the use of ALN -AS1 in pregnancy; however, there is no suspicion of 
human teratogenicity based on class effects or genotoxic  potential. ALN -AS1 was neither genotoxic nor clastogenic in in 
vitro and in vivo studies. Based on preliminary data from rat fertility/embryofetal development and rabbit 
embryofetal development studies, it is unlikely that ALN -AS1 administration to pregna nt women or animals poses a 
risk to embryofetal development ; however, in the absence of data from embryofetal developmental toxicity studies with 
ALN -AS1, . In a rat fertility/embryofetal development study at daily dose levels up to 16.5  mg/kg, no test arti cle-
related effects on female fertility or developmental endpoints were observed. In a rabbit embryofetal development 
study, maternal toxicity was observed at daily doses of >3 mg/kg (7.8 fold higher than the clinical monthly dose of 
5.0 mg/kg).  No terata were observed in this range -finding embryofetal development study.  Women of child bearing 
potential (WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test, cannot be breastfeeding, and must be willing to use acceptable 
method s of contraception during studies with ALN -AS1.  
Purpose:  Clarified the inclusion criterion for WOCBP when hormonal methods of contraception are medically contraindicated  a nd removed 
reference to low -dose gestagens  
The primary change occurs in Section 5.1, Inclusion Criteria  
Now reads:  3. WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test, cannot be breast feeding, and must be willing to use 1 highly 
effective method  acceptable methods  of contraception 14 days before first dose, throughout study participation, and for 
90 days after last dose a dministration.  Acceptable methods include hormonal methods along with an additional 
barrier method (eg, condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap), or a double barrier method of contraception for those 
WOCBP for whom a hormonal method of contraception is medical ly contraindicated due to underlying disease 
(see Section 6.4 for acceptable methods of contraception).

Amendment 1 Summary of Changes_ 10 November 2016 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 5 Section 6.4, Contraceptive Requirements
Purpose:  Clarified the criteria for individual dose modifications based on study drug -related AEs  
The primary change occurs in Section 6.2.3.2, Individual Dose Modifications  
Now reads:  Dose modifications are permitted for individual patients. If a patient has an AE that is related to a study drug (eg,related 
AE o f a recurrent ISR, or severe orISRs, or clinically significant LFT abnormalities) abnormality and the Investigator 
has concerns regarding further ALN -AS1 administration, the Medical Monitor and Investigator will review all available 
safety data for the patient. Based on this review, it may be determined that the patient is a candidate for a dose re duction. 
Dose reduction to a dose, which was found to be safe and well -tolerated by the SRC, a dose reduction to half the 
previously administered dose (eg, a 5.0 mg/kg dose would be reduced to a 2.5 mg/kg dose) or a reduction in dosing 
frequency from monthl y to every 3 months  is permitted. Subsequent ALN -AS1 administration at the previous , or 
higher,  dose may be considered based on the judgment of the Investigator and Medical Monitor.  
Purpose: While it was previously listed in the protocol in the Benefit -Risk Assessment that ALN -AS1 could increase clearance of drugs 
metabolized by the CYP3A isoform, it has been added to the concomitant medications section for clarification.  
The primary change occurs in Section 6.3, Concomitant Medications  
Added text:  ALN-AS1 could potentially increase the clearance of drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isoform.   Investigators will 
review all medications at study start and monitor response to these medications during the study.  For patients 
who require new medications while  on study, selection of medications that are not mainly metabolized by the 
CYP3A isoform is recommended.  A list of medications that are sensitive CYP3A substrates is in Table 6 Appendix 
Section 11.3.  In addition, a more detailed and current list of sensi tive CYP3A -metabolized medications and 
CYP3A -metabolized medications with a narrow therapeutic range is available at the Indiana University, Division 
of Clinical Pharmacology, website (http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/clinical -table/).[31]

Study Design  
This is a multicenter, open -label extension study to evaluate the long- term safety and clinical activity 
of ALN-AS1 in patients with AIP who completed study ALN -AS1-001. 
The last assessments performed, determining previous study (ALN -AS1-001) completion, will serve as 
the Screening/Baseline assessments in this study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed since the last 
assessment, safety assessments will be repeated before administration of ALN -AS1.  It is anticipated 
that patients will begin ALN -AS1 administration in this study within 6  months after the last dose of 
study drug in the previous study.  Eligibility will be confirmed before administration of the first dose of 
ALN -AS1 (Day 1 ).  Patients will undergo assessments at the clinical study center every month for the 
first 3 months.  Then, through Month 6, and according to the dosing regimen selected, assessments will 
take place at the clinical study center  or via a phone contact (for a n every month  dosing regimen, vi sits 
will be every month; for a n every 3 months dosing regimen, visits will be  every 3 months) .  After a 
patient has completed 6 months of ALN- AS1 administration in this study  (6 months in an every month 
dosing regimen), and where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow,  study 
visits and ALN -AS1 administration may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional.  
Home visits ma y occur at the discretion of the Investigator, b ased on safety and tolerability ; however, 
patients are required to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical study center every 3 months for the first 
year, and thereafter every 6 months through the end of the treatment period.  Patients will return to the clinical study ce nter for a posttreatment follow-up visit after administration of the last dose of 
ALN -AS1.  An ALA/PBG Monitoring/ EOS visit will be conducted  either at the clinical study center or 
via phone contact, unless treatment continues with ALN- AS1. 
Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain assessments,  
and narcotic use.  Patients will also be provided with laboratory sample collection kits and instructions 
for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center. 
A Safety Review Committee will review safety and tolerability data collected during the study with the 
primary purpose of protect ing the safety of patients participating in the study.  
Number of Planned Patients  
Up to 24 patients are planned for enrollment in this study  (including optional cohorts in 
ALN -AS1-001). 
Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria  
Patients with AIP , who have completed Part C of study ALN -AS1-001, will be eligible for screening  in 
this study.  Eligible p atients  will not be on a scheduled regimen of hem in to prevent  porphyria attacks 
at Screening .  Pat ients with alanine transaminase ≥2.0× upper limit of normal,  total bilirubin ≥2  mg/dL 
(unless bilirubin elevation is due to Gilbert’s syndrome), or e stimated glomerular filtration rate 
≤30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula)  at Screening are not 
eligible  for this study . 
Investi gational P roduct, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
ALN -AS1 Solution for Injection (subcutaneous use [SC] ) is comprised of a synthetic, small interfering 
RNA targeting ALAS1 and bearing a triantennary N- acetyl galactosamine ligand conjugated to the 
sense strand, formulated in phosphate buffer.   
The planned starting dose of ALN- AS1 is 2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1 as an SC injection  administered every 
3 months.  Before initiating dosing in this study, t he actual dose and dosing regimen administered will 
be determined based on SRC review of emerging data in Part C of study ALN- AS1-001.  Based on 
SRC review, a higher dose of ALN -AS1 may be administered and/or the dosing regimen adjusted to 
584
ALN -AS1 Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
19 July 2016  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  6 every month .  Either fixed or weight -based doses m ay be administered.   The dose and dosing regimen 
of ALN- AS1 administered in this study  will not exceed a previously explored dose and dosing regimen 
that was  determined to be safe and well- tolerated  in study ALN -AS1-001.  Further, the dose 
administered in this study  will not exceed the  maximum dose permitted in Part C of study 
ALN -AS1-001. 
Reference Therapy, D ose, and Mode of Administration  
Not applicable  
Duration of T reatment  and Study  
The duration of treatment is up to 36 months.  The estimated total time on study, inclusive of 
Screening /Baseline, for each patient is up to 44 months. 
Statistical Methods  
Statistical analyses will be primarily descriptive.  Incidence of AEs will be summarized by maximum 
severity and relationship to ALN-AS1.  Incidence of and serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs 
leading to discontinuat ion will also be tabulated.  By-patient listings will be provided for deaths, SAEs, 
and events leading to discontinuation.  
Laboratory shift tables from baseline to worst values will be presented.  Abnormal physical 
examination findings and electrocardiogram data will be presented in by -patient listings.  Descriptive 
statistics will be provided for electrocardiogram  interval data and presented as both actual values and 
changes from baseline relative to each on study evaluation and to the last evaluation on-study. 
Clinical activity of ALN -AS1 will be summarized primarily by descriptive statistics.  The clinical 
activity of ALN -AS1 will be evaluated by the frequency and characteristics of porphyria attacks 
including duration, treatment, and severity of porphyria attacks and number and duration of visits to a 
health care setting for acute porphyria care.  Patient diary recordings, including BPI-SF questionnaire 
scores,  will also be summarized .   
PD analysis will include the evaluation of change in ALA, PBG, and ALAS mRNA levels.  Descriptive 
statistics (eg, mean and standard error of the mean) for observed levels of PD parameters and the relative change from baseline will be presented for each of  the postdose follow -up time points. 
The PK concentration of ALN-AS1 will be determined.  Antidrug antibody results will be tabulated 
overall and by previous treatment in the previous  study (ALN- AS1-001).  A by- patient listing will also 
be provided. 
Additional exploratory analyses may be conducted on analytes related to targeting the heme 
biosynthesis pathway.  Quality of life scores will also be summarized.

ALN -AS1 Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
19 July 2016  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  9 c See Section  7.1 for details on the interval medical history/disease history to be recorded at Screening/Baseline.  Ongoing AEs from the previ ous study 
(ALN -AS1-001) will be captured as medical history.  
d A complete physical examination will be performed  at Screening/Basel ine, and D1.  At all other visits, a targeted physical examination will be performed.  On 
dosing  days, the physical examina tion will be performed predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, the physical examination can occur at any time 
during the visit.   See Section  7.5.3  for details on the  physical examination.  
e Height will be measured at Screening/Baseline only.  
f Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, oral body temperature, and respiratory rate.  On D1, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose; and 
2 hours (±10  minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose.  On days whe n ALN -AS1 is not administered, 
vital signs can be collected at any time during the visit.   Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be consistent for each patient), 
after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  
g Triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine position after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  On D1, ECGs will be 
performed within 1 hour predose and 2 hours (±10 minutes ) postdose.  On all other dosing days, ECGs will be collected within 1 hour predose.  
h Clinical laboratory parameters are described in Section  7.5.5 .  On dosing days, blood samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected within 1 hour 
predose; results are not required before dosing.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, blood samples can be collected at any time during the visit.  
i A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening/Baseline; thereafter, urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  Results must be available before dosing.  
j ALN -AS1 will be administered by SC injection according to the Pharmacy Manual.   See Section  6.2.2  for ALN -AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  For 
weight -based dosing, weight measured on the dosing day will be used to calculate the dose of ALN -AS1.  After M12, weight measured on the nearest prev ious 
visit will be used to calculate the weight -based dose of ALN -AS1. 
k Spot urine samples will be collected for measurement of ALA, PBG, and creatinine levels.  On dosing days, samples should be collected predose.  
l On dosing days, blood and urine samples for ALAS1 mRNA (and possible biomarker) analysis will be collected within 1 hour predose.  
m Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points listed in  Table  3 (Appendix Section  11.1).  
n On dosing days, blood samples for antidrug antibody analysis should be collected within 1 hour predose.  
o Urine sample s should be collected within 24 hours of the start of clinical intervention for a  porphyria  attack (eg, hemin or glucose  administration) and within
24 hours of the end of clinical intervention for a porphyria  attack  through M39 .  If patients are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria
attack, laboratory sample collection kits will be provided that contain instructions for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center, if
possible.   These u rine samples  may also be analyzed  for exploratory biomarker s.
p In addition to the time points indicated, the EQ -5D-5L questionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a porphyria attack  
(but not more than once in a 6 month period) , if possible.  
q Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain assessments, and narcotic use on  a daily basis through M9 ; 
thereafter, acute porphyria attacks will be recorded in the diary.  The BPI will be completed on a weekly basis as part of the patient diary through M9, then 
Q3M.  
r Patients will be contacted by phone to collect AEs and concomitant medications.  Patients will also be reminded to collect and send urine samples to the clinical 
study center , if possible,  if they are  unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria attack . 
s Medications that are ongoing from the previous study  (ALN -AS1-001), started between the previous study and this study, and started after signi ng informed 
consent in this study, will be captured as concomitant medication(s).

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  19 1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Disease Overview
The porphyrias are a family of rare metabolic disorders predominately caused by a genetic 
mutation in 1 of the 8 enzymes responsible for heme synthesis.[ 1]  The 2 major categories are 
erythropoietic and hepatic, depending on the major site of expression of the underlying enzyme 
deficiency. [2]  In addition, the porphyrias are classi fied as acute if patients present with 
neurovisceral symptoms (eg, abdominal pain and neurologic symptoms) or cutaneous if they 
present with dermal blistering or photosensitivity. [3, 4]   
This study will include patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), the most commo n acute 
hepatic porphyria (AHP) .  AIP occurs as a result of an autosomal dominant mutation leading to 
partial deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), the third enzyme in the heme 
biosynthesis pathway.[ 5]  The rate limiting step in heme synthesis is the upstream enzyme 
5-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 ( ALAS1 ), which is controlled by feedback repr ession via the 
end-product heme.  In response to a decrease in endogenous heme in the liver, as can occur with 
fasting, hormonal alterations, or with cytochrome P450 (CYP) inducing drugs, ALAS1 is 
induced, resulting in increased flux through the heme synthesis pathway.  In patients with AIP, this can result in the marked accumulation of the toxic heme intermediates porphobilinogen 
(PBG) and delta aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in the blood and urine due to the deficiency in the 
downstream PBGD.  Clinically, this manifests as acute attacks characterized by severe abdominal pain, cardiovascular as well as neurologic and psychiatric dysfunc tion.[6] 
1.1.1. Epidemiology 
Over 370 mutations have been identified in the PBGD gene, which in most instances result in its reduction by approximately 50%.  The exact prevalence of AIP is unknown due to under 
diagnosis, variation by geographic region, and the differences in penetrance observed for the 
different mutations. [2]  However, it is estimated that the prevalenc e of AIP is 5 to 10 per 
100,000 people in Western countries, while in Sweden it occurs in 1 in 1,000 people due to a 
founder effect associated with the resultant G593A mutation.[ 7-10]   AIP shows incomplete 
penetrance and on average only 10% to 50% of carriers with a mutation pre sent with clinical 
symptoms .[11]  It has been proposed that unknown inherited co-factors, in addition to PBGD 
mutations, may explain why a small percentage of patients present with much more severe 
disease while the majority remain asymptomatic.  
Patients with AIP present with acute attacks characterized by neurovisceral symptoms and signs 
including severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or less commonly diarrhea, 
hypertension, tachycardia, fever, muscle weakness, as well as neurological (eg , neuropathy, 
seizures) and psychiatric (eg, anxiety  and confusion) manifestations.[ 12]  AIP attacks typically 
start after puberty and can be triggered by exogenous factors such as medications (especially barbiturates, sulfonamides, and hydantoins), stress, exogenous hormones, nutritional status, and infection.  Clinically active disease is more common in women, where attacks often occur around the menstrual cycle and are likely precipitated by hormonal changes.  
Many AIP patients remain undiagnosed given that the disease is rare and characterized by non-specific symptoms (eg, abdominal pain and nausea).[ 2]  The initial diagnosis involves

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  20 demonstrating elevated urinary PBG  (typically 20 -50 × normal reference range) and ALA 
(typically 5 -20 × normal reference range) when the patient is having acute attack symptoms.  
Once a test is positive for elevated ALA and PBG and porphyria is suspected, genetic testing for 
a PBGD mutatio n is performed .   
There are 4 main clinical phenotypes of  AIP.  Latent gene carriers have never had an acute attack 
and are biochemically inactive (normal urinary ALA and PBG).   Asymptomatic high excreters 
(ASHE) do not have current acute att acks, but are biochemically active (increased urinary ALA 
and PBG).  The increased levels of ALA and PBG in ASHE pati ents are lower than those in AIP 
patients during an acute attack, but are still significantly higher than normal reference values.[ 6-
8]Sporadic attack patients have infrequent acute attacks.  Recurrent attack patients have
≥4 attacks per year requiring hospitalization or treatment by a me dical professional .[7] 
1.1.2. Current Management and Unmet Medical Need  
Managemen t of acute attacks often requires hospitalization.  Patients are initially treated with 
supportive care and carbohydrate loading, analgesics and anti- emetics, and removal of k nown 
precipitating factors .[13]  In pat ients with moderate to severe attacks, or who fail to respond to 
supportive measures, tre atment with intravenous ( IV) hemin  (dail y for 3 -5 days) is commenced.  
Symptoms typically begin to improve after 2 to 5 days of hemin treatment, accompanied by a 
lower ing of urinary ALA and PBG levels to below or at the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
reference value; however, in some patients attacks can last several weeks, requiring prolonged 
hemin use and hospitalization.[ 14]  With prolonged and s evere attacks, cranial nerve 
involvement can occur, leading to bulbar paralysis, respiratory failure, and death.[ 15]  
Hemin, a blood derived therapy, was approved as Normosang® (heme arginate) in the European 
Union (EU) and as Panhematin® (lyophilised hematin) in the United States (US) in 1999 and 
1983, respectively.[ 16, 17]   In the EU, heme arginate is indicated for the treatment of acute 
attacks of hepatic porphyria ( eg, AIP, variegate porphyria, and hereditary coproporphyria); 
whereas, in the US lyophilized  hemin  is limited to the amelioration of recurrent attacks of AIP 
temporally related to the menstrual cycle.  Approval of both products was based on biochemical efficacy (ie, lowering of ALA and PBG) as well as data from uncontrolled case series and case 
reports. [18-22]   Hemin side effects include thrombophlebitis, transient anticoagulation, and in 
rare cases, anaphylaxis or renal failure. [22-24]   In addition, hemin administration requires a large 
vein for administration, often necessitating central venous access. 
Whil e the majority of patients who experienc e attacks  have  them sporadically, it is estima
ted that 
up to 1,000 AIP patients experience recurrent attacks (typically defined as ≥4 per year) in the US 
and EU combined.[25]  While hem in is currently only approved to ameliorate acute attacks, it is 
administered prophylactic ally in some patients with recurrent  attacks  (eg, administered every 
1-2 w eeks). [26]  Potential problems associated with chronic hemin administration include 
infusion site phlebitis, iron overload, a
nd the need for chronic IV access and associated 
complications  (eg, risk of infection or occlusion).[5]  In addition, there ha ve been reports of a 
decrease in efficacy with chronic hemin administration, as evidenced by the need to increase the 
frequency or dosage  of hemin prophylaxis over time in attempt  to maintain a clinica l effect.[27]  
In patients with very severe recurrent attacks, or in whom hemin treatment  is not effective, liver 
transplantation can be curative; however, organ transplantation is a high-risk procedure and is 
rarely used as a treatment option [34].  Given the significant m orbidity and mortality, there 
599
ALN -AS1  Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
19 July 2016  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  21 remains a significant unme t need for an efficacious, simple , fast -acting and better tolerated 
treatment for acute or prevent recurrent attacks in patients with A IP. 
1.2. RNA Interference  
RNA interference (RNAi ) is a naturally occurring cellular mechanism mediated by small 
interfering RNA s (siRNAs ) for regulating gene expression.  Typically, synthetic siRNAs are 
19 to 25 base pair double stranded oligonucleotides in a staggered duplex with a 2-nucleotide 
overhang at both or 1 of the 3’ ends.[ 28]  Such siRNAs can be d esigned to target an endogenous 
messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript of a given gene.  When introduced into cells, the net effect 
of an RNAi -based pharmacological approach is the binding of the siRNA to its complementary 
mRNA sequence, cleavage of this target m RNA, and reduction of synthesis of the target protein, 
resulting in a decrease o f the target protein levels .[29]  The ability to selectively and potently 
degrade the mRNA encoding the ALAS1 protein (thereby decreas ing accumulation of the toxic 
intermediates ALA and PBG) using an siRNA is a novel approach for the prevention and 
treatment of acute attacks in patients with AIP.   
1.3. ALN-AS1  
ALN -AS1 is a synthetic RNAi therapeutic currently  in development for treatment of acute 
attacks in patients with AIP, the mo st common AHP. 
1.3.1. Nonclinical Summary  
The pharmacology, safety pharmacology, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics and toxicology of ALN -AS1 were evaluated in a series of in vitro and i n vivo nonclinical studies. 
ALN -AS1 is pharmacologically active in rodents and nonhuman primates (NHP) due to 
conservation within the siRNA target sequence.  Transfection assays in human liver carcinoma cell line -G2 cells showed dose-dependent inhibition of endogenous ALAS1 mRNA levels with 
an half -maximal inhibitory concentration of approximately 26 pM of ALN-AS1.  In multiple 
studies in the mouse , rat, and NHP, potent and dose- dependent pharmacologic activity has been 
demonstrated with subcutaneous ( SC) administration of ALN -AS1, which results in consistent 
reduction of ALAS1 mRNA in liver.  After single dose administration, ALAS1 mRNA 
suppression in liver is durable depending on the dose administered (1- 4 weeks) and correlates 
with the extent of ALAS1 mRNA suppression observed in serum or urine.  Dose dependent, 
steady -state ALAS1 mRNA reduction  has also been demonstrated with repeat -dose regimens.  
Studies in rodent AIP models have confirmed that ALAS1 mRNA reduction  with ALN -AS1 
treatment correlates with decreases in ALA and PBG heme intermediates.  
A Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) -compliant safety pharmacology study conducted in NHPs 
showed no functional cardiovascular or respiratory effects, with a no observed effect level (NOEL) of 150 mg/kg.  Neurolo gical assessments were conducted as part of a 13 -week repeat 
dose GLP toxicity study in NHPs (weekly dosing); no ALN- AS1-related neurobehavioral 
observations occurred, with a NOEL for neurological effects of 150 mg/kg (highest dose tested).  Genetic toxici ty studies (bacterial reverse mutation, human peripheral blood lymphocyte 
chromosomal aberrations, and rat bone marrow micronucleus) assays were all negative at 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) S2 (R1) limit doses.

ALN -AS1  Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
19 July 2016  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  22 Two to 4- week exploratory (non-GLP) dose-range finding toxicology studies were conducted 
with ALN -AS1 in mice, rats, and NHPs.  In all 3 species, no dose- limiting toxicity was observed 
up to the highest dose evaluated (300 mg/kg weekly SC dose), with the rat appearing to be the 
most sensitive species.  These studies were followed by 13-week GLP toxicology studies in rats 
and NHPs where ALN -AS1 was administered daily (100 mg/kg) and weekly at doses of 0, 3, 10, 
and 30 mg/kg in the rat and weekly at doses of 0, 15, 50, and  150 mg/kg in the NHP.  The no 
observed adverse effect levels were 30 mg/kg in the rat and 150 mg/kg in the NHP (highest dose tested in each species).  GLP chronic toxicity stud ies (26 weeks in the rat and 39 weeks in the 
NHP) have been conducted and are cur rently in the reporting phase.  Results of these studies will 
be available to support the clinical dosing. 
1.3.2. Clinical Summary  
ALN -AS1 is being investigated in an ongoing, Phase 1 study (ALN- AS1-001) to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics ( PK), and pharmacodynamics ( PD) of ALN -AS1 
administered subcutaneously in patients with AIP.  The study is being conducted in 3 parts.  
Part A and Part B are single-blind, placebo-controlled portions of the study in patients with AIP 
who are ASHE.  Patients are randomiz ed in a 3:1 ratio to receive either a single dose (Part A) or 
multiple doses (Part B ; 2 doses 28 days apart ) of ALN -AS1 or placebo.  Patients who participate 
in Part A and Part B are not eligible to participate  in this study.  In Part C , patients with AIP who 
have recurrent attacks will receive multiple doses  of ALN -AS1 dosing over a 12-week period in 
a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled part of the study.  T his study will enroll patients 
who completed Part C of study ALN- AS1-001. 
Dosing has been completed in Part A (0.035-2.5 mg/kg) and Part B of the study (0.35-1.0 mg/kg).  A total of 23 unique patients with AIP who are ASHE have received at least 1 dose of study drug (20 patients received at least 1 dose of ALN -AS1 and 3 patients received 
placeb o only).  ALN -AS1 has been generally well -tolerated.  Adverse Events (AEs) in patients 
administered AL N-AS1, which were reported in 2 patients each, were abdominal pai n, diarrhea, 
and hypoaesthesia in Part A; and nasopharyngitis, pruritus, and rash in Part B.  In Part A, AEs 
considered possibly or definitely related to ALN-AS1 were reported in 5 patients:  diarrhea, dyspepsia, haematochezia, injection site erythema, injection site pain, blood creatinine increased, glomerular filtration rate decreased, and h ypoesthesia (1 patient each).  In Part B, AEs 
considered possibly or definitely related to ALN-AS1 were reported in 3 patients:  pruritus and rash (2 patients each); and rash macular and rash pruritic (1 patient each).  There were 2 SAEs of abdominal pain in Part A, 1 patient each in the 0.035 mg/kg and 0.10 mg/kg dose groups, which 
were not considered to be related to study drug or due to AIP.  Across Part A and Part B, all AEs 
were mild or moderate in severity, except for 1  serious adverse event ( SAE ) of abdominal pain 
(0.10 mg/kg dose group), which was considered severe.  There were no dose- related trends in 
AEs and no AEs leading to discontinuation.   
Overall, a dose-dependent reduction of urinary ALA and PBG as well as ALAS1 mRNA was observed following single and multiple doses of ALN-AS1.  Preliminary data demonstrate that 
administration of a single dose of ALN-AS1 at ≥1.0 mg/kg lowered ALA and PBG levels ≥80% 
and ALAS1 mRNA levels ≥50% when compared to baseline levels in patients with AIP who are ASHE.   Similarly, administration of multiple doses  of ALN -AS1 at ≥0.35 mg/kg lowered ALA 
and PBG levels ≥80%.  ALAS1 mRNA levels were reduced ≥50% in the 1.0 mg/kg dose group when compared to baseline levels in patients with AIP who are ASHE.  ALA and PBG levels in 
601

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  23 the 1.0 mg/kg dose group in Part A were sustained for ≥180 days and in both dose groups in 
Part B for ≥160 days.   Specifically, t he maximum mean reduction from baseline of urinary ALA 
and PBG reached 93% in the 2.5 mg/kg dose gr oup, which were sustained for approximately 
14 weeks .  The maximum mean reduction in ALAS1 mRNA relative to baseline of 66% was 
demonstrated in the 2.5 mg/kg dose group which was maintained beyond 42 days. 
Cumulatively, nonclinical and clinical data to date support long- term administration of 
ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP.  
1.4. Study Design Rationale  
This is a  multicenter, open- label extension study designed to evaluate the long- term safety and 
clinical activity  of subcutaneously administered ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP who ha ve 
completed clinical study ALN -AS1-001.  The primary endpoint for the study is the incidence of 
AEs. 
1.5. Dose Rationale  
Clinical data from Part A and Part B of the ongoing study ALN -AS1-001 demonstrate that single 
(0.035-2.5 mg/kg) and multiple (0.35-1.0 mg/k g) doses of A LN-AS1 have been generally 
well-tolerated in patients with AIP who are ASHE .  Additionally, data from this study indicate 
that a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1 result s in near normalization of urine ALA and PBG 
levels , which is  sustained for approximately 14 weeks.   
Patients in Part C of the ongoing study ALN -AS1-001 who are eligible for participation in this 
study will likely  require a higher dose of ALN -AS1 to normalize ALA and PBG as they  have 
higher levels of ALAS1 upregulation and highe r baseline levels of ALA and PBG, when 
compared to patients with AIP who are ASHE.[ 30]  For example, based on preliminary data in 
Part A and Part B of the ALN -AS1-001 study, t he mean PBG level of patients who are ASHE is 
21.9 mmol/mol Cr  (N=28) ; whereas, in Part C of this s tudy in  patients with AHP who have 
recurrent porphyria a ttacks , the mean PBG level is approximately 49.3 mmol/mol Cr  (N=12). 
The planned starting dose of ALN- AS1 is 2.5 mg/kg ALN -AS1 as an SC injection  administered 
every 3 months, which is also the initial dose administered to patients with AIP in Part C of 
study ALN -AS1-001.  Before initiating dosing in this stud y, the actual dose and dosing regimen 
administered will be determined based on SRC review of emerg ing data in Part C of study 
ALN -AS1-001.  Based on SRC review, a higher dose of ALN -AS1 may be administered  and/or 
the dosing regimen adjusted to every month.  Either fixed or weight- based doses may be 
administered.   The dose and dosing regimen of ALN- AS1 administered in this study  will not 
exceed a previously explored dose and dosing regimen that was  determined to be safe and 
well-tolerated  in study ALN -AS1-001.  Further, t he dose administered in this study will not 
exceed the maximum dose permitted in Part C of study ALN- AS1-001.   
The duration of dosing in this study is supported by the overall favorable safety profile of ALN-AS1 in the ongoing clinical study  ALN AS1 -001 and the absence of new findings in 
nonclinical studies with  ALN -AS1.  GLP chronic toxicity studies (26 weeks in the rat and 
39 weeks in the NHP) have been conducted and are currently in the reporting phase.  Results of these studies will be available to support the clinical dosing.

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  24 1.6. Benefit-Risk  Assessment  
Patients participating in this study may experience a reduced number or severity of porphyria 
attacks, reduced treatment with IV hemin , and/or reduced requirement for pain medication . 
The potential risks associated with administration of ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP are as 
follows: 
•Injection site reactions  (ISRs):  ALN -AS1 is administered by SC injection.  In the
ongoing ALN- AS1 clinical study, AEs of ISRs have been infrequently reported and
have been mild to moderate in severity with single dosing.  Injection site rotation and
close monitoring have been implemented in ALN- AS1 clinical studies to reduce the
potential for ISRs.
•Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities:  As ALN -AS1 is ta rgeted for delivery to the
liver, and reversible hepatic changes were observed in some animal species, there is apotential for development of LFT abnormalities.  To minimize the potential for LFT
abnormalities, patients are required to have adequate liver  function at study entry and
LFTs are monitored during the study.
•Reproductive health:  No data are available on the use of ALN-AS1 in pregnancy;
however, there is no suspicion of human teratogenicity based on class effects or
genotoxic potential.  ALN- AS1 was neither genotoxic nor clastogenic in in vitro and
in vivo studies.  It is unlikely ALN-AS1 administration to pregnant women or animals
poses a risk to embryofetal development; however, in the absence of data from
embryofetal developmental toxicity studies with ALN -AS1, women of child bearing
potential (WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test, cannot be breastfeeding,
and must be willing to use an acceptable method of contraception during studies withALN -AS1.
•CYP inhibition:  A study in NHP demonst rated that ALN -AS1 dosing could
potentially increase the clearance of drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isoform.  As
contraceptive hormones are metabolized via CYP3A, WOCBP must use a barrier
method of contraception, in addition to hormonal contraception, dur ing study
participation.  Additionally, Investigators will review all patient medications at study
start and monitor responses to these medications during the study.  A list of
medications that may be CYP3A inhibitors and inducers is available at the India na
University, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, website. [31]

4.1. Summary of Study Design
This is a Phase 1/2 multicenter, open -label extension study to evaluate the long -term safety and

19 July 2016  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  26 The last assessments performed , determining previous study (ALN -AS1-001) completion, will 
serve as the Screening/Baseline assessments in t his study.  If more than 60 days have elapsed 
since the las t assessment, safety assessments (eg, ECG and clinical laboratory tests)  will be 
repeat ed before administration of ALN- AS1.  It is anticipated that patients will begin ALN -AS1 
administration in this study within 6  months after the last dose of study drug in the previous 
study.  Eligibility will be confirmed during Screening/Baseline and before administration of the 
first dose of ALN -AS1 (Day 1 ).  Patients will undergo assessments at the clinical study center 
every month for the first 3 months.  Then, through Month 6, and according to the dosing regimen 
selected, assessments will take place at the clinical study center or via a phone contact (for an 
every month dosing regimen, visits will be every month; for an every 3 months dosing regimen, visits  will be every 3 months; see Section  6.2.2).  After a patient has completed 12 months of 
ALN -AS1 administration in this study  (6 months in an every month dosing regimen), and w here 
applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow , study visits and ALN- AS1 
administration may take place at the patient’s home by a healthcare professional  (as indicated in 
the Schedules of Assessments in  Table 1 and Table 2;  and Table 4 and Table 5 in Appendix 
Section  11.2) .  Home visits may occur at the discretion of the Investigator, based on safety and 
tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit at th e clinical study center 
every 3  months for the first year, and thereafter every 6 months through the end of the treatment 
period.  Patients will return to the clinical study center for a posttreatment follow -up visit after 
administration of the last dose of ALN- AS1.   An ALA/PBG Monitoring/ EOS visit will be 
conducted either at the clinical study center or via phone contact, unless tr eatment continues with 
ALN -AS1. 
Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain 
assessments, and narcotic u se.  Additionally, p atients will be encouraged to report to the clinical 
study center if they experience a porphyria attack through Month 39.  In the event that patients 
are unable to report to the clinical study center  during a porphyria attack, laboratory sample 
collection kits containing instructions for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical 
study center, if possible, will be provided.  Patients will be contacted by phone after a porphyria attack  to record attack details .  If patient s are experiencing  signs and symptoms of a porphyria 
attack when ALN -AS1 adm inistration  is scheduled, the Investigator will determine w hether 
administration of ALN -AS1 is appropriate .  If patients are treated for a porphyria attack at a 
health care facility (eg, hospital, emergency department, infusion center, or outpatient clinic ) 
other than the clinical study center, copies of medical records, including discharge summaries, will be requested.   
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review safety and tolerability data collected during the 
study with the primary purpose of protecting the safet y of patients participating in the study  (see 
Section  4.6).

ALN -AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
19 July 2016  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential    30        6.2.2. Dose and Administration 
The planned starting dose of ALN-AS1 is 2.5 mg/kg ALN- AS1 as an SC injection administered 
every 3 months ( Table 1 and Table 2) .  Before initiating dosing in this study, the actual dose and 
dosing regimen administered will be determined based on SRC review of emerg ing data in 
Part C of study ALN- AS1-001.  Based on SRC review, a higher dose of ALN-AS1 may be 
administered and/or the dosing regimen adjusted to every month ( Table 4 and Table 5 in 
Appendix Section 11.2) .  Either fixed or weight- based doses may be administered .  The dose and 
dosing regimen of ALN -AS1 administered in this study  will not exceed a previously explored 
dose and dosing regimen that was  determined to be safe and well -tolerated  in study 
ALN -AS1-001.  Further, t he dose administered in this study will not exceed the  maximum dose 
permitted in Part C of study ALN- AS1-001.  See Section  6.2.3 for details on dose modifications. 
The study drug will be administered under the supervision of a healthcare professional .  After a 
patient has completed 12 months of ALN- AS1 administration in this study  (6 months in an every 
month dosing regimen), and w here applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure 
allow,  study visits and ALN- AS1 administration may take place at the patient’s home by a 
healthcare professional .  Home visits may occur at the discretion of the Investigator, based on 
safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical 
study center every 3 months for the first year, and thereafter every 6 months through the end of 
the treatment period .   
If a patient does not receive a dose of ALN -AS1 within the specified dosing window, the 
Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor.  After such consultation, the dose may be administered or considered missed and not administered. 
Patients will be permitted to miss an occasional dose of study drug; h owever, if a patient misses 
2 consecutive doses, the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, will discuss 
whether the patient will be able to continue on the study.  
Detailed instructions for study drug administration are found in the Pharmacy  Manual.  
6.2.3. Dose Modifications 
6.2.3.1. Study Population Dose Modifications 
During the study, dose modifications are permitted for the study population, or based on the dose 
cohort into which patients were originally randomized in study ALN- AS1-001.  Following SRC 
review of emerging safety and  tolerability da ta from Part C of study ALN -AS1-001, or from this 
study ( ALN -AS1-002), the dose and dosing regimen  may be modified.  However,  the dose and 
dosing regimen of ALN -AS1 will not exceed a previously explored dose and dosing regimen that 
was determined to be safe and well -tolerated  in study ALN- AS1-001.  Patients enrolling in this 
study after a dose modification decision has been implemented may start at the newly identified dose and regimen. 
6.2.3.2. Individual Dose Modifications 
Dose modifications a re permitted for  individual patients.  If a patient has an AE that is related to 
study drug (eg , recurrent or severe ISRs, or clinicall y significant LFT abnormalities ) and the 
Investigator has concerns regarding further ALN -AS1 administration, the Medical Monitor and 
609
ALN -AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
19 July 2016  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential    31        Investigator will review all available safety data for the patient.  Based on this review, it may be 
determined that the patient is a candidate for a dose reduction .  Dose reduction to a dose, which  
was found to be safe and well- tolerated by the SRC, is permitted.  Subsequent ALN- AS1 
administration  at the previous, or higher, dose may be considered based on the judgment of the 
Investigator and Medical Monitor. 
6.2.4. Preparation, Handling, and Storage 
Staff at each clinical study center or the home healthcare professional will be responsible for 
preparation of ALN -AS1 doses, according to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy Manual.  No 
special procedures for the safe handling of study drug  are required.  
Study drug will be stored upright and refrigerated at approximately 5±3°C.  Any deviation from the recommended storage conditions should be reported to the Sponsor and use of the study drug halted until authorization for its continued use has been provided by the Sponsor or designee. 
A Sponsor representative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, 
storage, dispensing procedures, and records. 
6.2.5. Packaging and Labeling 
ALN -AS1 Solution for Injection (SC use) is packaged in 2 mL glass vials with a fill volume of 
no less than 0.55 mL.  The container closure system consists of a Type I glass vial, a T eflon 
faced brom obutyl 13 mm stopper and a flip-off Truedge aluminum seal. 
6.2.6. Accountability  
The Investigator or designee will maintain accurate records of receipt and the condition of the 
study drug supplied for this study, including dates of receipt.  In addition, accurate records will 
be kept of when and how much study drug is dispensed and administered to each patient in the 
study.  Any reasons for departure from the protocol dispensing reg imen must also be recorded.  
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of all study drugs.   All used, 
partially used, and unused study drug will be returned to the Sponsor (or designee) or destroyed at the clinical study center according to applicable regulations.   
6.3. Concomitant Medications  
Use of concomitant medications will be recorded on the patient’s case report form ( CRF ) as 
indicated in the Schedules of Assessments ( Table 1 and Table 2;  and Table 4 and Table 5 in 
Appendix Section 11.2).   This includes all prescription medications, herbal preparations, over the 
counter (OTC) medications, vitamins, and minerals.  Any changes in medications during the 
study will also be recorded on t he CRF.  
Any concomitant medication that is required for the patient’s welfare may be administered by the 
Investigator.  However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding 
the medication are recorded on the eCRF.  Concomi tant medication will be coded using an 
internationally recognized and accepted coding dictionary. 
Patients are not permitted to be on hemin proph ylaxis at Screening ; however, patients are 
permitted to receive concomitant hemin treatment for the management of acute porphyria 
610
ALN -AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
19 July 2016  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential    32        attacks.  P atients experiencing  signific ant breakthrough attacks while enrolled in this study, 
necessitating frequent hemin treatment, may receive hemin prophylaxis if in the Investigator’s 
judgment this is  clinically beneficial to the patient.  The Investigator should contact  with the 
Sponsor and Medical Monitor before prophylactic hem in treatment.   The dos e, regimen,  and 
dates of administration  will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF .   
Pain medication (eg, opi ates, opioids, narcotic analgesics ) and glucose administration are  
permitted for the management of porphyria and for acute porphyria attacks . 
If patients use nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory medications  intermittently or chronically, they 
must have been able to tolerate them with no previous side effects (eg, gastric distress or 
bleeding).   
Standard vitamins and topical medications are permitted; h owever, topical steroids must not be 
applied anywhere near the injection site(s) unless medically indicated.  
6.4. Contraceptive Requirements  
WOCBP must be willing to use a highly effective method of contraception 14 days before first 
dose, throughout study participation, and for 90 days after last dose administration.   Highly 
effective methods of birth control result in a low failure rate (ie , less than 1% per year).  Birth 
control methods which may be considered as highly effective include: 
• Established use of oral (except low-dose gestagens [eg, lynestrenol and 
norethisterone]), implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal methods of 
contraception.  WOCBP using hormonal methods of contraception must also use a 
barrier method (condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault cap] in conjunction with spermicide [ eg, foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository]).  If 
hormonal methods of contraception are  medically contraindicated for WOCBP due to 
underlying disease, a double-barrier method (combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm, or sponge, in conjunction with spermicide) is also considered an acceptable method of contraception. 
• Placement of an intrauterine device  
• Placement of an intrauterine hormone- releasing system  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post- vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for fem ale patients on the 
study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient)  
• True sexual abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
patient.  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  Abstinent 
patients must agree to use 1 of the abovementioned contraceptive methods, if they 
start sexual relationships during the study and for 90 days after last dose administration . 
WOCBP includes any female patient who has experienced menarche and who is not 
postmenopausal or permanently sterilized (eg, bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, or 
611

an alternative medical cause, confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone level within the 
postmenopausal range. 
6.5. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with study drug administration will be verified through observation by study 
personnel or trained home healthcare professionals.  
7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
The schedule of study assessments is provided in Table 1 .  
7.1. Screening/Baseline Assessments  
Informed consent, patient demographic data, and eligibility criteria  will be confirm ed at  
Screening/Baseline .  An interval medical history /disease history will be obtained at

The assessment of safety during the course of the study will consist of the surveillance and 
recording of AEs including SAEs, recording of concomitant medications and measurements o f 
vital signs, physical examination , and ECG findings and clinical laboratory evaluations . 
Safety will be monitored over the course of the study by an SRC as  described in Section  4.6. 
7.5.1. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, heart rate, oral body temperature, and 
respiratory rate.  Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be consistent for each patient), after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  Blood 
pressure should be taken using the same arm throughout the study .  Oral body temperature will 
be obtained in degrees Celsius, heart rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in beats 
per minute, and respiration rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in breaths per 
minute.  
For the safety of the patient, additional vital sign assessments may be added at the discretion of 
the Investigator.  
7.5.2. Weig ht and Height  
Height will be measured  in centimeters  at the Screening/Baseline visit only .  Body weight will be 
measured in kilograms .  Body mass index will be calculated in the database.  
7.5.3. Physical Examination 
Complete physical examinations will include the  examination of the following:  general 
appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, chest/respiratory, heart/cardiovascular, gastrointestinal/liver, musculoskeletal/extremities, dermatological/skin, thyroid/neck, lymph nodes, and neurological/psychiatric. 
Targeted physical examinations will include the examination of the following:  general 
appearance, chest/respiratory, heart/cardiovascular, gastrointestinal/liver, and neurological/psychiatric.  
7.5.4. Electrocardiogram

ventricular rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, ST and T waves, Bazett- corrected QT  
interval (QTcB) and Fridericia -corrected QT interval (QTcF).  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for reviewing the ECGs to assess whether the results 
have changed since the Screening/Baseline visit and to determine the clinical relevance of the 
results.  These assessments will be recorded on the eCRF.  For any clinically relevant  ECG 
changes from the Screening/Baseline visit (eg, ischemic ECG changes, wave/interval changes, or 
arrhythmia), the Investigator must contact the Medical Monitor to discuss continued participation 
of the patient in the study. 
7.5.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central  laboratory.  In the event of 
an unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring  after study drug 
administration, the test should be repeated and followed up at the discretion of the Investigator 
until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis is made to adequately explain the abnormality.

the pregnancy test must be known before study drug administration .  Patients who are pregnant 
are not eligible for study participation.  Any woman with a positive pregnancy test during the study will be discontinued from study drug, but will continue to be followed for safety.  Patients determined to be pregnant while on study will be followed until the pregnancy outcome is known 
(see Section  7.5.6.6 for follow -up instructions).  
7.5.6. Adverse Events  
7.5.6.1. Definitions  
Adverse Event  
According to the ICH E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 21 Code of F ederal Regulations  312.32, I nvestigational N ew Drug Safety Reporting, a n AE is 
any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational subject administered a 
medicinal  product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening ( An event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred.  It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomal y or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient and may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above (eg, 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug dependency or abuse). 
616
ALN -AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
19 July 2016  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential    38        Adverse Event Severity  
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below: 
Mild:  Mild events are those which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal 
daily activity.  
Moderate:  Moderate events are those which cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with normal daily activities.  
Severe:  Severe events are those which incapacitate and prevent usual activity.  
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity.  A Es characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of the start and stop of each incidence.  When changes in the severity of an AE 
occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day should 
be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates)  
AE severity and seriousness are assessed independently.  ‘Severity’ characterizes the intensity of an AE.  ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see definitio n for Serious Adverse Event). 
Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Treatment  
The relationship of each AE to study treatment should be evaluated by the Investigator using the following criteria:  
Definitely related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to the medication administration, and which cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  The response to withdrawal of the drug should be clinically plausible. 
Possibly related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to the medication administration, but which could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemical s.  Information on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or 
unclear.  
Unlikely related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no temporal relationship to medication administration, and which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations. 
Not related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality that has no temporal relationship to the medication or has more likely alternative etiology.  
Adverse Events of Clinical Interest  
The following events are considered to be adverse events of clinical interest:  
• ISRs  
617
ALN -AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002 
19 July 2016  
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential    39        • Hepatic AEs, including LFT abnormalities considered clinically significant by the 
Investigator . 
7.5.6.2. Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last 
visit.  The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospitalized, had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC).  
In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant 
laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are relevant to patient safety . 
Recording Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for record ing non-serious AEs that are observed or reported by  
the patient  after administration of the first dose of study drug regardless of their relationship to 
study drug through the end of study.  Non- serious AEs will b e followed until the end of study.  
The Investigator is responsible for record ing SAEs that are observed or reported by the patient  
after the time when the  informed consent is signed regardless of their relationship to study drug 
through the end of study .  SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution,  until baseline  level  
is reached,  or until the SAE is considered by the Investigator to be chronic or the patient is 
stable , as appropriate. 
All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for the patient, whether or not they are considered to be drug- related.  Each AE must be described in 
detail:  onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to investigational drug , 
action taken, and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). 
For SAEs, record the event(s) on the eCRF.  If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is 
unavailable, complete the backup SAE form. 
For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest, additiona l clinical information may be 
collected based upon the severity or nature of the event. 
If a patient has ISRs meeting any of the following criteria, the Investigator or delegate should 
contact the Medical Monitor and submit a supplemental ISR eCRF: 
• ISRs that are recurrent and/or demonstrate a pattern of increasing severity  
• Any ISR that is determined to be severe and/or a cause for study drug discontinuation  
• Any ISR which, in the opinion of the Investigator, requires further medical evaluation or 
treatmen t 
In some cases, where it is medically appropriate, further evaluation may include photographs, referral to a dermatologist, skin biopsy, or other laboratory testing.  If a biopsy was obtained, the Sponsor may request that the biopsy also be reviewed by a central dermatopathologist.  To better 
understand the safety profile of the study drug, additional analysis of biopsy tissue may be 
performed according to local regulations. 
618
ALN -AS1   Clinical Study Protocol ALN -AS1-002

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential    40        For patients with hepatic AEs, additional information, including, clinical history , course of event, 
and local laboratory results to monitor LFT levels or other laboratory parameters, may be 
collected.  
7.5.6.3. Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting  to Sponsor/ Designee 
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by the Investigator.  Any AE and 
laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section  7.5.6.1 must be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee within 24  hours from the time that clinical study center personnel first 
learns of the event.  All SAEs must be reported regardless of the relationship to study drug. 
The initial report should include at least the following information : 
• Patient’s study number 
• Descr iption and date of onset of the event 
• Criterion for serious  
• Preliminary assignment of relationship  to study drug 
• Investigator/ clinical study center  information  
To report the SAE, complete the eCRF .  If the EDC system is unavailable, complete the backup 
SAE  form.   Within 24 hours of receipt of follow-up information, the Investigator must update the 
report .  SAEs must be reported using the contact information provided in the Study Manual. 
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken by the Investigator using his/her best medical 
judgment to treat the SAE.  These measures and the patient’s response to these measures should 
be recorded.  All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be followed by the 
Investigator until satisfactory resolution or the  Investigator deems the SAE to be chronic or 
stable.  Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed by the Investigator as 
needed to adequately determine the etiology of the event . 
7.5.6.4. Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities 
The S ponsor or its representative is required to report certain study events in an expedited 
manner to the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency’s EudraVigilance electronic system according to Directive 2001/20/EC, and to all country Regul atory Authorities 
where the study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations. 
The following describes the safety reporting timeline requirements for suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions  (SUSARs)  and other reportable events: 
Immediately and within 7 calendar days 
• Any suspected adverse reaction that is associated with the use of the study drug, unexpected, and fatal or life threatening.  Follow-up information must be reported in 
the following 8 days. 
619

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential    41        Immediately and within 15 calendar days 
• Any suspected adverse reaction that is associated with the use of the study drug, 
unexpected, and serious, but not fatal or life threatening, and there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the reaction. 
• Any find ing from tests in laboratory animals that suggest a significant risk for human 
patients including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity. 
• Any event in connection with the conduct of the study or the development of the 
study drug that m ay affect the safety of the trial patients.  
In addition, periodic safety reporting to regulatory authorities will be performed  by the Sponsor 
or its representative according to national and local regulations. 
7.5.6.5. Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Insti tutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
SUSARs  will be reported to the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) per their institutional policy by the Investigator or Sponsor (or Sponsor 
designee) according to country requirements.  Copies of each report and documentation of 
IRB/IEC notification and acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator’s study file. 
7.5.6.6. Pregnancy Reporting  
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the course of this study  through 90 days following 
the last dose of study drug, the Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of being notified of the pregnancy.  Details of the pregnancy will be recorded on 
the pregnancy reporting form.  The patient s hould receive any necessary counseling regarding 
the risks of continuing the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. 
The pregnancy should be followed by the Investigator until completion.  At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy.  If the outcome of the 
pregnancy results in a  postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
or congenital anomaly, then the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE 
as outlined in Section  7.5.6.3.   
7.5.6.7. Overdose Reporting  
An overdose is defined as any dose administered to or taken by a patient (accidentally or 
intentionally) that exceeds the highest daily dose, or is at a higher frequency, than included in the protocol.  It is up to the investigator to decide whether a dose is to be considered an overdose, in 
consultation with the Sponsor.  Overdose must be recorded in the eCRF.  
All reports of overdose (with or without an AE) must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor 
or designee.

questionnaire measuring  health outcomes.[ 34]  In addition to the time points indicated, the 
EQ-5D-5L questionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a 
porphyria attack (but, not more than once in a 6 month period), if possible. 
8. STATISTICS  
A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written after finalizing the protocol and before 
database lock.  The plan will detail the implementation of all the statistical analyses in  
accordance with the principl e features stated in the protocol . 
8.1. Determination of Sample Size  
This is a Phase 1/2 multicenter, open- label extension study to evaluate the long -term safety and 
clinical activity of ALN -AS1 in patients with AIP who completed st udy ALN -AS1-001.  S afety, 
tolerability, PK, and PD of ALN- AS1 will be investigated .  The sample size was not determined 
based on statistical considerations .  Up to 24 patie nts are planned for this study (including 
optional cohorts in ALN- AS1-001). 
8.2. Statistical Methodology 
The statistical and analytical plans presented below summarize the more complete plans to be 
detailed in the SAP.  Any changes to the methods described in the final SAP will be described 
and justified  as needed  in the clinical study report.  
Statistical analyses will be primarily descriptive in nature.  Descriptive statistics (eg,  mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) will be presented for continuous variables.  Frequencies and percentages will be presented for categorical and ordinal variables. 
Analyses will be performed using SAS
® (Version 9.2, or higher).

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  Confidential  54 Investigator, b ased on safety and tolerability; however, patients are required to complete at least 1 visit at the clinical study ce nter Q3M through M12, and 
thereafter Q6 M. 
c See Section  7.1 for details on the interval medical history/disease history to be recorded at Screening/Baseline.  Ongoing AEs from the previ ous study 
(ALN -AS1-001) will be captured as medical history.  
d A complete physical examination will be performed  at Screening/Baseline, and D1.  At all other visits, a targeted physical examination will be performed.  On 
dosing  days, the physical examina tion will be performed predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not admini stered, the physical examination can occur at any time 
during the visit.   See Section  7.5.3  for details on the  physical examination.  
e Height will be  measured at Screening/Baseline only.  
f Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, oral body temperature, and respiratory rate.  On D1, vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose; and 
2 hours (±10  minutes) postdose.  On all other dosing days,  vital signs will be collected within 1 hour predose.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered, 
vital signs can be collected at any time during the visit.   Vital signs will be measured in the seated or supine position (should be consistent for each patien t), 
after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  
g Triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be performed in the seated or supine position after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes.  On D1, ECGs will be 
performed within 1 hour predose and 2 hours (±10 min utes) postdose.  On all other dosing days, ECGs will be collected within 1 hour predose.  
h Clinical laboratory parameters are described in Section  7.5.5 .  On dosing days, blood samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be collected within 1 hour 
predose; results are not required before dosing.  On days when ALN -AS1 is not administered,  blood samples can be collected at any time during the visit.  
i A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening/Baseline; thereafter, urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  Results  must be available before dosing.  
j ALN -AS1 will be administered by  SC injection according to the Pharmacy Manual.   See Section  6.2.2  for ALN -AS1 dose and dosing regimen.  For weight -
based dosing, weight measured on  the dosing day will be used to calculate the dose of ALN -AS1.  After M12, weight measured on the nearest previous visit  
will be used to calculate the weight -based dose of ALN -AS1. 
k Spot urine samples will be collected for measurement of ALA, PBG, and creatinine levels.  On dosing days, samples should be collected predose.  
l On dosing days, blood and urine samples for ALAS1 mRNA (and possible biomarker) analysis will be collected within 1 hour predose.  
m Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points listed in  Table  3 (Appendix Section  11.1).  
n On dosing days, blood samples for antidrug antibody analysis should be collected within 1 hour predose.  
o Urine sample s should be collected within 24 hours of the start of clinical intervention for a  porphyria  attack (eg, hemin or glucose  administration) and within
24 hours of the end of clinical intervention for a porphyria  attack  through M39 .  If patients are unable to report to the clinical study center during a porphyria
attack, laborato ry sample collection kits will be provided that contain instructions for collecting and sending urine samples to the clinical study center, if
possible.   These u rine samples  may also be analyzed  for exploratory biomarker s.
p In addition to the time points indicated, the EQ -5D-5L questionnaire should be completed once during the treatment period if a patient has a porphyria attack  
(but not more than once in a 6 month period) , if possible.  
q Patients or caregivers will be provided with a diary to record acute porphyria attacks, pain assessments, and narcotic use on a daily basis through M9 ; 
thereafter, acute porphyria attacks will be recorded in the diary.  The BPI will be completed on a weekly basis as part of the patient diary through M9, then 
Q3M . 
r Medications that are ongoing from the previous study  (ALN -AS1-001), started between the previous study and this study, and started after signing informed 
consent in this study, will be captured as concomitant medication(s).

Notes:   
•White boxes represent visits to the clinical study center or when patients will be contacted by phone; grey boxes represent study visit that may be
conducted while the patient is at home .
•When scheduled at the same time points, assessments of vital signs and 12 -lead ECGs should be performed first, before th e physical examinations
and blood/urine sample collections.
a Where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, study visits and ALN -AS1 administration may take place at the patient’s home by a 
healthcare professional.  Home visits may occur at the discretion of the Investigator, based on safety and tolerability; however,  patients are required to complete 
at least 1 visit at the clinical study center Q6M . 
b Patients who discontinue treatment will be asked to complete the M39 visit assessments.   If a patient chooses to withdraw from the study, every effort should 
be made to conduct early the assessments performed at the M39 visit.   See Section  5.3 for details on removal from treatment or assessment.

This  phase   II  trial  of  the  anti-GD2  murine   IgG3   monoclonal   antibody   3F8  combined   with

residual disease (MRD) in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) and help  establish  the 
optimal  way to use GM-CSF.  The study  will focus  on two groups  of patients:  Group  1 patients  
have primary  refractory  NB in bone marrow   (i.e.,  incomplete   response   to  standard  treatment),  
and Group  2 patients  have no evidence  of NB by standard  studies  but are at high risk for relapse.  
We will apply  real-time quantitative  RT-PCR  methodology  targeting  GD2 synthase  mRNA  for 
monitoring  MRD;  we will test the hypothesis  that early BM response  has prognostic  import.  The 
method  of using  GM-CSF to achieve  optimal  antitumor  biologic  effect  is not known  but will be 
studied  by comparing  anti-NB effects  in patients  with the subcutaneous  (sc) usage  of GM-CSF in 
this protocol  versus  results  achieved  with the intravenous  (iv)  usage   of GM-CSF  in the  prior 
study.  We hypothesize  that the sc route  will augment  overall  immune  function  with consequent  
improved  anti-NB activity.  Changing  to the simple  sc usage,  as compared  to the prior 2-hr iv 
method,  will vastly  simplify  treatment,  both for patients  and for  medical  staff,  and  will reduce  
costs;  the ultimate   result  will be promoting  wider  availability  of this treatment.  
 
2.1 OBJECTIVES  AND  SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
• Assess  the efficacy  of  subcutaneous   GM-CSF  in  enhancing   3F8-mediated  
ablation  of BM disease.  
 
• Apply  real-time quantitative  RT-PCR  to test the hypothesis  that minimal  residual  
disease  content  of BM after the first treatments  with 3F8/GM -CSF has significant  
prognostic  impact on relapse-free survival. 
 
• Simplify  treatment  with consequent  reduction  in cost. 
 
3.1 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
 
3.2 Dise ase background:  Neuroblastoma  (NB)  is the  most  common   extracranial  
solid tumor  of childhood;  50-60% of patients  present  with an unresectable  primary  tumor  and 
metastases  in bone   marrow   (BM).1  Intensive   induction   chemotherapy   and  aggressive   surgery  
have improved  remission  rates in young   patients2-4; results  have been  less impressive   in 
adolescents  and adults  in whom  NB is especially  chemoresistant.5,6 Realization  of an effective  
strategy  for eradicating  minimal  residual  disease  (MRD)  has remained  a formidable  challenge.  Post-
surgical  use of local radiotherapy  helps  control  MRD  in the primary  site.7 Myeloablative  therapy  
(with  stem-cell support)  has been  the most common  approach  for eradicating  MRD  in distant  
sites.   The long-term relapse -free survival  rate in the most recent  national  study  was only 
~20%,  although  the vitamin  A derivative  13-cis-retinoic  acid (isotretinoin)  helped  to prolong  
relapse -free survival.8 These  results,  plus the potentially  severe  toxicities  of chemotherapy  and 
radiotherapy,   are compelling  reasons  for pursuing  novel  therapeutic   approaches.  
 
3.3 Rationale  for  immunothe  rapy:   Various   strategies   have  undergone   clinical  
testing to induce or augment  immune-mediated  attack  against  cancer.  However,  few  clinical 
trials  have  used  monoclonal   antibody -targeted   immunotherapy  against   solid  tumors   in children9- 
18 or adults,19-22 especially  with antibody -dependent  cellular  cytotoxicity  (ADCC)  as the principal  
underlying   immune   cytotoxic   mechanism.      Also,   an  antineoplastic   role  for  granulocytes   has

received  scant  attention.23 A treatment  program  combining  3F8 and GM-CSF thus represents  an 
attempt to help fill a gap in the emerging field  of immunotherapy. 
 
3.4 Rationale  for 3F8:  3F8 is a murine  IgG3  MoAb  that is well suited  for targeted  
immunotherapy.   The reasons  are several.   First,  the intensive  chemotherapy  required  to produce  
the minimal  disease  state optimal  for immunotherapy  in NB patients  results  in prolonged  severe  
lymphopenia.  This setting  is unfavorable  for active  immunotherapy   but  allows   passive  
immunotherapy  since the patient  will be unable  to reject  allogeneic,  xenogeneic,  or genetically - 
engineered  antibodies.  Second,  3F8 recognizes  the ganglioside  GD2.24 This target   antigen  is 
expressed  at high density  on NB (but has restricted  distribution  in normal  human  tissues),  is not 
modulated  from the cell surface  when  bound  by antibodies,  and is genetically  stable  (unlike  tumor -
associated  antigens  such as immunoglobulin  idiotypes  on lymphoma  cells).25-27 Third,  scintigraphy  
using  131I-3F8 confirms  that 3F8 localizes  selectively   to  GD2(+)  tumor  deposits  in patients.28 The 
excellent  targeting  potential  of 3F8 was  evidenced   by its  high tumor   to  non- tumor  ratio,  the 
high percent  injected  dose per gram  uptake,  and the limited,  if any, nonspecific  liver and spleen  
uptake.28,29  Fourth,   3F8  mediates  destruction  in vitro  of GD2(+)  human  solid tumor  cells by 
human  complement30 and by human  lymphocytes,  cultured  monocytes,  and neutrophils.31-33 Finally,  
the capacity  of 3F8 to activate   complement   on NB cells (which  lack decay  accelerating  factor34) 
raises  the possibility,  not only of complement -mediated  lysis in patients, but also  of the  release  
of complement  fragments that may elicit an inflammatory influx of granulocytes  capable  of lysing  
3F8-labeled  tumor  cells. Furthermore,  the deposition  of complement  fragments  C3b and iC3b on 
NB cells may enhance  ADCC  because  the receptor  for iC3b – variously  called  Mac-1, CR3,  
CD11b/CD18,  or άMβ2-integrin  – is a key element  in anti- GD2 MoAb -mediated   tumor  cell kill 
by neutrophils,35,36  which  are the most abundant  circulating  class of leukocyte.  
 
3.5 Rationale  for GM -CSF:  GM-CSF has the  potential   for  amplifying   3F8 
antitumor  activity  in patients  via effects  on granulocytes  and tissue -based  macrophages.  Reasons  
for combining  GM-CSF with 3F8 include  the following.  First,  granulocyte  production  is only 
transiently  suppressed  with chemotherapy  and GM-CSF  increases   numbers   of  circulating  
neutrophils  and eosinophils,  does not affect  complement  levels,  and is well tolerated  compared  to 
other    cytokines    such   as   interleukin -2.37 Second,  granulocytes  from patients  receiving  
chemotherapy and from normal volunteers are effective in mounting ADCC against NB cells via 
non-oxidative  mechanisms,  and GM-CSF enhances  this cytotoxicity.36,38 -42 Third,  eosinophilic  
infiltration  of some  cancers  has favorable  prognostic  significance,  and eosinophils  exhibit  potent  
antitumor  activity  in animal  models.43,44  Fourth,  activated  monocytes -macrophages  efficiently  
phagocytose  NB cells, and exposure  in vitro or in vivo to GM-CSF primes  monocytes - 
macrophages  for greater  antineoplastic  cytotoxicity.33,39,45 -50 Fifth,  GM-CSF enhances  the 
proliferation,  maturation,  and function  of  antigen -presenting   cells,  including   antigen   processing  
and presentation  by macrophages  and dendritic  cells37,51,52 - effects  that might  promote  induction,  
or antitumor  activity,   of an idiotypic  network.53-56 Finally,   GM-CSF  is not a growth  factor  for 
NB cells in vitro.57 
 
3.6 GM -CSF-me diate  d activation  of polymorphonucle  ar ne utrophils  (PM Ns): 
PMNs  are the predominant  class of circulating  leukocytes;   chemotherapy   only  transiently  
decreases   their  numbers   and  largely   spares   their  cytotoxic   capabilities.      These   features   are

advantageous  for immune -based  attack  against  cancer.23 We and others  have shown  that Mac-1 
(CD11b/CD18),  FcRII,  and FcRIII  are required  for optimal  ADCC  in a  system  using  human  
PMNs  as effectors,  human  NB cells as targets,  and clinically  active  anti-GD2 MoAbs  as 
mediators.35,36  Efficient  tumor -cell kill occurs  despite  the large size  of  the  targets   (which  
precludes  a role for phagocytosis)  and their relative  resistance  to reactive  oxygen  species.41 GM- 
CSF enhancement  of ADCC  in this system  correlates  with upregulation  of Mac-1 and  with 
increased  exocytosis  of azurophil  (primary)  granules  which  contain  cathepsin  G and  defensins  
capable  of lysing  NB cells.42 To elucidate  the cytotoxic   mechanisms   of  anti-GD2  MoAb - 
mediated  ADCC,  we used blocking  MoAbs,  PMNs  devoid  of Mac-1 (from  donors  with 
leukocyte  adhesion  deficiency),  and PMNs  that do not generate  reactive   oxygen  species  (from  
donors  with chronic  granulomatous  disease),35 while  others  used blocking  MoAbs,  electron  
microscopy,   and PMNs  from healthy   donors  as well as from patients.36 
 
3.7 Rationale  for quantitating  BM dise ase by re al-time RT-PCR:  Curative  
strategies  for stage  4 NB must encompass  control  of both the primary  mass  and distant  disease.  
Dose -intensive  chemotherapy  has had a favorable  impact  on resectability  of primary  tumors  and 
surgical  removal  of all visible  tumor,  followed  by local radiotherapy,  reduces  the risk of relapse  
in the  primary   site  to  <10%.4,7  Dose -intensive   chemotherapy   eliminates   histologically   evident  
BM involvement in 90% of high-risk cases.3 These encouraging results have shifted the focus of 
curative   strategies  to the problem  of MRD  – which  is readily  assessed  in BM. 
Adjuvant  treatments,  such as immunotherapy  with monoclonal  antibodies,  may make  
gradual  and not quantum  changes  in MRD,  which  by definition  is beyond  the sensitivity  of 
conventional  histologic58  or  radiographic   techniques.   The  availability  of more  sensitive  methods  
for identifying  and quantitating  occult  tumor  cells in sequential  BM specimens  can allow  
determination  of the efficacy  and optimal  duration  of adjuvant  treatment.  Thus,  the absence  of 
detectable  tumor  cells in BM can serve  as a surrogate  end point   for  the  adjuvant   treatment  
strategy,  while  quantitative  data on BM disease  will help  detect   relapse   earlier   and  indicate   a 
need for a change  in treatment.  
We59-65 and others66-70 have identified  MRD  in BM by immunological  and molecular  
methods.  The limit of detection  for immunocytology  is 1/105 to 1/106 cells;  RT-PCR has slightly  
superior  sensitivity  with a range  of 1/105 to 1/107 cells. A drawback  to immunocytology  is the 
need for freshly  collected  samples  and the  technique’s   labor   intensive   aspect   (counting   cellls 
under  a microscope).  In contrast,  molecular  monitoring  of tumor  cells by RT-PCR  uses cryo- 
preserved  mononuclear  cells and experiments  can be repeated  multiple  times  and  for  multiple  
markers  as they are being  developed.  Pitfalls  in the use of molecular -based   assays   of MRD  
include  false positivity  due  to the presenc e of the “tumor -specific”  markers  in normal  cellls, and 
the process  of illegitimate   transcription  (i.e., the transcription  of any gene in any cell type).  
Development  of a real-time quantitative  RT-PCR  assay  broadens  the potential   for 
monitoring  MRD.  The advantages  of this technique  include  a wide  linear   dynamic   range   and 
superior  sensitivity  and accuracy,  which  allows   good   intra-  and  inter-assay  reproducibility,   plus 
high throughput  capacity,  speed,  and elimination  of lengthy  post-PCR  handling  steps,  which  
prevents  potential  carryover  contamination.  Real-time quantitation  of GD2 synthase   mRNA  
provides  information   on expression  of the key enzyme   in the biosynthesis   of GD2.63,64 
 
3.8 Re sults using  re al-time quantitative  RT-PCR  of GD2  synthase  mRNA:  Most  
recently,  we have used this method  to assess  molecular  response  in BM from patients  with high-

risk NB treated  with 3F8 plus GM-CSF by 2-hr iv infusion;  we now intend  to apply  this method  
for comparing  anti-NB activity  of the subcutaneous  versus  iv route  of GM-CSF usage.  In our 
retrospective  study,  the patients  fell into four groups  before  treatment  with 3F8 and iv GM-CSF:  
33 patients  were in complete/very  good  partial  remission,  32 had primary  refractory  disease  
(incomplete  response  to induction),  11 had secondary  refractory  disease  (incomplete  response  to 
treatment  for relapse),  and 16 had progressive  disease.  Molecular  detection  of tumor  cells was 
evident  in pretreatment  BMs  of all four groups  (32%,  59%,  64%,  and 75%,  respectively)  with 
mean  GD2 synthase  transcript  levels   of 7.5, 22.3, 54.7, and 436.3, respectively  (Table  1).

with the sc route;  our concern  was that high serum  levels  of GM-CSF might  impede  granulocyte  
trafficking  into tissues.73 However,  for circulating  tumor  cells in BM or blood,   this concern  is 
dwarfed  by the more  potent  antitumor  effects  from prolonged  cytokine  exposure  following

HAMA  titers or no HAMA  formation.15 This association  of a transient  low level HAMA/anti - 
idiotype  (Ab2)  antibody  response  with better  PFS was a seemingly  paradoxic  finding  since 
HAMA/Ab2  blocks  3F8 binding  to tumor  cells. The  unexpected   observation   regarding  
HAMA/Ab2  and survival  led to the hypothesis  of a host idiotypic  network  induced  by 3F8 (Ab1)  
and responsible  for long-term tumor  control.  The idiotypic   network   was  first  postulated   by 
Jerne75 for immune  regulation  and later demonstrated  in human  disease  models,   including  cancer  
patients.76-79 Anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab2) in the HAMA pool may mimic antigen GD2 and 
stimulate  an Ab3 antibody  response.  We previously  reported  the association  of anti-anti-idiotype  
(Ab3)  with prolonged  survival  among  patients  who underwent  myeloablative   therapy   with 
autologous  stem-cell rescue.53  Other   investigators   have  postulated   the  development   of  an 
idiotypic  network  in patients  treated  with 17-1A antibodies,  where  both Ab3 antibodies  as well 
as anti-idiotypic   and anti-anti- idiotypic   T cells have been  demonstrated.54,55 
In our study  of 34 patients,  consistent  with the emergence  of an idiotypic  network,  Ab3 
(anti-anti-idiotype)  and Ab3' (anti-GD2) response  at 6-14  months  after treatment  with 3F8 alone  
correlated  with improved  PFS,  and higher  Ab3 titers showed  a stronger  correlation  with 
improved  outcome,  while  non-idiotype  antibody  responses  (anti-mouse  or anti-tumor  nuclear  
antigen)  had no apparent  impact  on outcome.56 Since  GD2 is an auto-antigen,   induced  Ab3' 
response  represented  a breakdown  in self-tolerance.   We  hypothesized   that  significant   rises  in 
Ab3 or Ab3' would  not be possible  unless  suppressor  pathways  were removed  and naive  T or B 
cells  were  allowed  to repopulate.   Following  intensive  chemotherapy  that eliminates  a large part 
of the lymphoid  system,  exposure  to tumor -selective  Ab1s  (3F8)  might  induce  unique  Ab2s  that 
could  bias the recovering  repertoire  towards  the GD2 antigen  network.  The potential  for biasing  
the immune  system  towards  specific  antigens  has been  well documented  in murine  models80 and 
human  disease  states.81,82  If true, one would  expect  such  an idiotypic  network  to  be  most 
successful  following  intensive  immunosuppressive  therapy,  and not easily  induced   in 
immunocompetent  patients.  In fact, we found  that myeloablative  therapy  suppressed  HAMA  and 
Ab2 but was followed  by the appearance  of Ab3 which  in turn correlated  with prolonged  
survival.53,56  The prerequisite  of strongly   immunosuppressive  therapy  may explain  why in most 
clinical  studies  of MoAbs,  such  an  idiotypic   network   is  not  commonly   observed.   However,  
when  found  in patients  with colorectal  or ovarian  carcinoma  treated  with specific  MoAbs,  the 
idiotypic  network gave patients superior  survival  advantage.54,55,76,77,83-87 
 
3.11 Isotre  tinoin  (13-cis-re tinoic  acid)  was shown  in a randomized  national  study  to 
decrease the risk of relapse in  p atients treated  in  complete  remission.8  This  agent  has 
subsequently  become  standard  of care for NB patients  in complete  remission.  It will be used in 
this protocol  after patients  are evaluated  for response  (and for toxicity)   to 3F8/GM -CSF.  
 
3.12 Inte rpre tations  and implications:  This phase  II trial explores  the utility  of RT- 
PCR  for monitoring   anti-NB  activity  of immunotherapy,   with an emphasis   on early recognition  
of treatment  efficacy.  The studies  focus  on BM; findings   may  not  reflect   total  body  tumor  
burden. Metastatic NB is, however, a systemic disease, and,  as  with leukemia,88  BM  status 
appears  to approximate  the overall  disease  state.  If the RT-PCR  method  proves  to be sensitive,  it 
will provide  a useful  tool for measuring  NB-cell content  in BM as a patient   goes  through  
treatment.  The ability  to identify  patients  not likely  to  benefit   from  further   use  of  a  given  
adjuvant  therapy  will allow  a more  timely  switch  to a possibly  better  treatment.  We hypothesize  
that  quantifying   GD2  synthase   transcript   levels   will help  stratify  patients   by tumor   load,  define

tumor  thresholds  that correlate  with favorable  clinical  outcome,   and  provide   prognostic  
classification  for patients  receiving  immunotherapy.  Risk-related  molecular   guidelines   can  be 
rapidly  incorporated  into future  treatment   programs.  
Our RT-PCR  method  provides  a quantitative  measure,  such that the percentage   of 
patients  who achieve  CR in BM, and the degree  of response  with 3F8/GM -CSF,  can be 
calculated  and compared  to other  adjuvant  treatments.  With  NB, where  randomized  trials are 
difficult  to carry  out because  of the small  number  of affected  patients,  such quantitative  analyses  
acquire  even greater  utility  for rapidly  identifying  both the best agent  and its optimal  use in a 
curative   treatment  program.  
The findings  regarding  RT-PCR   utility   in  the  adjuvant   setting,   granulocyte   activation,  
and idiotypic  network  will have general  implications  for antibody -based   therapeutic   strategies  
against  solid tumors  in humans.  Also,  the ease  of  administration   of  the  treatments   (a 
subcutaneous  injection,  which  is given  at home,  and a 30-minute  intravenous  infusion  in the 
outpatient  clinic),  plus their transient  acute  side-effects,  are compatible  with widespread  usage  of 
this regimen beyond our hospital – a strong positive  factor in furthering product development.

4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is a phase  II, open-label,  single  arm study  to assess  the activity  of 3F8/GM -CSF against  
neuroblastoma  and to investigate  whether  subcutaneous  (sc) usage  of GM-CSF is as good  or 
better  than short -term (2-hr) intravenous  (iv) usage  for optimizing  anti-neoplastic   activity.  
Group  1 patients  have refractory  bone  marrow  disease,  and Group  2 patients  have  no 
evidence  of disease  by standard  studies,  but are at high risk for relapse.  Clinical  results  will 
be compared  to those  observed  in the predecessor  trial in which  only iv GM-CSF was used 
with 3F8.   Real-time quantitative   RT-PCR63-65   will be used to assess  minimal  residual  disease  
in bone marrow.  All patients  will receive  a minimum   of  4  cycles   of  treatment   and  will 
continue   treatment   through  24 months.

5.1 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC   AGENTS  
 
5.2 3F8 monoclonal  antibody  (IND number  of BB-IND-8449)  
 
5.2.1 Source  and Pharmacology:  Monoclonal  antibody  3F8 is purified   by 
column  chromatography.  The final product  is tested   to  assure   that  it  is  free  of nucleic  
acid, murine  viruses,  bacteria,  fungi,  mycoplasma  and pyrogens.  Plasma  concentrations  
achieved  after a 5 mg/m2  and 20 mg/m2  IV dose were 1.1 +/- 0.6 and 3.7 +/- 1.4 ug/mL,  
respectively.   Supplier:  3F8 is manufactured   as an investigational  agent.  
 
5.2.2 Formulation  and Stability:  The purified  antibody  is frozen  at –80oC,  at 2 
mg/mL  0.1 M citrate -phosphate  pH 4.2 buffer  in glass vials. At –80oC it is stable  for at 
least 3 years.  For IV administration,  3F8 should  be diluted  into 10 ml 5% human  serum  
albumin and millipore  (0.2 um) filtered  before use.  Route of Administration:  IV infusion. 
 
5.3 Yeast -derived  human  recombinant  granulocyte -macrophage  colony  stimulating  
factor  (GM -CSF;  LEUKINE  (sargramostim))   is produced  by Berlex  Laboratories,  Seattle,  WA. 
 
5.3.1 LEUKINE  is a sterile,   white,   preservative -free,  lyophilized   powder  
suitable  for IV infusion  upon  reconstitution  of 250 mcg vials;  these   vials  should   be 
reconstituted  aseptically  with 1.0 ml Sterile  Water  for  Injection,   USP  (without   preservative).  
The reconstituted  LEUKINE  solutions  are clear,  colorless,  isotonic  with a pH of 7.4 ± 0.3, and 
contain  250 mcg/ml  of Sargramostim.  The single -use vial should  not be re-entered  or reused.  
Do not save any unused  portion  for later administration.  Vials containing  500 mcg of 
LEUKINE are already in solution and are multiple  dose vials. 
 
5.3.2 During  reconstitution  the Sterile  Water  for Injection,  USP should  be 
directed  at the side of the vial and the contents  gently  swirled  to avoid  foaming  during  
dissolution.  Avoid excessive  or rigorous agitation;  do not shake. 
 
5.3.3 Dilution  for IV infusion  should  be performed  in 0.9%  Sodium  Chloride  
Injection.  USP.  If the final concentration  of LEUKINE  is below  10 mcg/ml,  Albumin  (Human),  
add 1 mg Albumin  (Human)  per l ml 0.9%  Sodium  Chloride  Injection,  USP (e.g. use 1 ml 5% 
Albumin  [Human]   in 50 ml 0.9%  Sodium  Chloride  Injection,   USP).  
 
5.3.4 An in-line  membrane  filter  is not to be used for IV infusion of LEUKINE. 
 
 
5.3.5 LEUKINE  contains  no antibacterial  preservative  and therefore  should  be 
administered  as soon  as possible,   and  within  6 hours  following  reconstitution  and/or  dilution  for 
IV infusion.  Store  LEUKINE  powder,  reconstituted  solutions,  or  diluted   solutions   under  
refrigeration  at 2-8°C (36-46°F);  do not freeze  or shake.  LEUKINE  vials are intended  for single

use  only;  discard   any  unused   solution   after  6  hours.   Do  not  use  beyond   the  expiration  date 
printed  on the vial. 
 
5.3.6 In the absence  of compatibility  and stability   information,   no  other  
medication  should  be added  to infusion  solutions  containing  LEUKINE.  Use only 0.9%  Sodium  
Chloride Injection,  USP to prepare IV infusion solutions. 
 
5.3.7 Aseptic  technique  should  he employed  in the preparation  of all LEUKINE  
Solutions.  To assure  correct  concentration  following  reconstitution,  care should  be exercised  to 
eliminate  any air bubbles  from the needle  hub of the syringe  used to prepare  the  diluent.  
Parenteral  products  should  be inspected  visually  for particulate  matter  and discoloration  prior to 
administration  whenever   solution  and container   permit.  
 
5.3 13-cis-Retinoic  Acid (NDC  #0004 -0155 -01,0004 -0169,  0004 -0156 -01- 
ISOTRETINOIN,  ACCUTANE)  
 
5.3.1 Source  and Pharmacology:  The exact  mechanism  of retinoic  acid (RA) - 
induced  maturation  of tumor  cells is not known.  In neuroblastoma  cell lines it has been  shown  to 
down  regulate  MYCN  RNA  and  protein  expression,   and  such down  regulation  correlates  with 
the ability  of isotretinoin  to induce  tumor  cell growth  arrest.  Recent  studies  using   gene 
transfection  directly  implicate  down  regulation  of MYCN  expression   by  isotretinoin   as  a  key 
event  in achieving  sustained  arrest  of neuroblastoma  cell proliferation.  RA also  appears   to 
enhance  normal  hematopoietic  differentiation  by increasing  the responsiveness  of myeloid  and 
erythroid   progenitor   cells  to  the  action   of  myeloid   colony   stimulating   activity   and 
erythropoietin,.  respectively.  Metabolism:  RA is 99.9%  bound  in plasma  (almost  entirely   to 
albumin) and has a half-life of 10-20 hours. The major metabolite is 4-oxoisotretinoin, and 
excretion  is in the urine and feces.  A single  oral dose of 100mg/m2 isotretinoin  will produce  peak  
plasma  levels  of 1-2mM.   The mean  peaktime  as 3.2 hours  after 80mg  orally,  with a terminal  t½ 
of 10 to 20 hours.  Administering  160 mg/m2/day to children  after autologous  bone marrow  
transplantation  has been  shown  to achieve  13-cis-RA levels  of 5 to 7 micromular.  
 
5.3.2 Formulation  and Stability:  Isotretinoin,  which  is the 13-cis isomer   of 
retinoic  acid,  will be  used.   This  is a yellow--orange  crystalline  powder  with a molecular  weight  
of 300.44.  Isotretinoin  is sensitive  to light and oxygen,  and so it should  not be removed  from the 
capsule  for longer  than one hour prior to administration  to the patient  and it should  be kept in 
subdued  light  as much  as possible.  
 
5.3.3 Guidelines  for Administration:  PO with fat-containing  food or milk to 
enhance  absorption.  Administration  of the entire  capsule  is to be encouraged  and small  children  
can be trained to swallow  them using similar  sized candy. 
5.3.4 Supplier:  Isotretinoin  is available  commercially  under  the trade  name  
ACCUTANE  (Roche  Laboratories)  in 10mg,  20mg,  and 40mg  soft gelatin  capsules.  See package  
insert for further  information.

7.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
 
In each of the past 2 yrs, 23 patients  have been  treated  on the predecessor  of this protocol.  
We anticipate  an increase  in this accrual  rate, which  will allow  rapid  realization  of preliminary  
conclusions,  with completion  of the trial in ~3 yrs. Given  the favorable  prior  efficacy -toxicity  
profile  with 3F8/GM -CSF,  we expect  that all patients  will complete  the trial. Patients  will be 
offered  participation  in this study  by their attending  physician  in the Department  of Pediatrics,  
Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center.  No patient  will be identified  by chart review  or direct  
advertising.  The attending  physician  will be responsible   for  explaining   the  study,   obtaining  
written  informed   consent,   and  registering  the  patient   on study.     Patients  will mainly  be children

9.1 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION   PLAN  
 
9.2 Schedule:  The total dosage  of 3F8 per cycle  is the same  as in prior trials (100 
mg/m2), administered  at 20 mg/m2/day and infused   over ~1.5 hr or less (0.5  hr is customary),  
with analgesics  and antihistamines  used as needed  for expected  side-effects.  3F8 is started  ~1 hr 
after completion  of GM-CSF administration.  GM-CSF is dosed  at 250 mcg/m2/day from day –5 
to day +1 (Wednesday  to Tuesday  is customary)  , and is 500 mcg/m2/day thereafter  (i.e., on days 
+2 to +4; Wednesday  to Friday),  as in the predecessor  protocol.18,74 Patients  come  off study  if 
progressive disease occurs or if there is life-threatening grade 4 toxicity from 3F8; otherwise, 
patients  will receive  a minimum  of 4 cycles  of treatment  and will continue  treatment  through  24 
months .    It is expected  that patients  will receive  ~10 cycles.  
For Group  1 patients  (enrolled  on study  for treatment  of primary  refractory  disease),  the 
break  between  end of a cycle  of 3F8/GM -CSF and start of next cycle  is 2-to-4-weeks  through  4

subsequent  breaks  are ~8 weeks.  Isotretinoin  is started  after cycle  2 of 3F8/GM -CSF.  Road  
map/schema  is in section  4.2. Regarding  patients  in second  or greater  CR from relapse  in the 
central  nervous  system,  if they develop  early HAMA  which  precludes  timely  completion  of the 
minimum  of 4 cycles  of 3F8/GM -CSF,  they are eligible  to go off protocol,  to be treated  with 
low-dose maintenance  regimens  of irinotecan,94 temozolomide,95  or  the  two  agents  combined;96 
they can resume  treatment  with 3F8/GM -CSF if HAMA  becomes  negative.  
Patients  who develop  early HAMA  which  precludes  timely  treatments  with 3F8/GM -CSF 
(>4 week  delay)  are eligible  to receive  low-dose maintenance  regimens  such  as  irinotecan  
alone,94  temozolomide   alone,95  irinotecan -temozolomide,96   or   cyclophosphamide -topotecan.97 
They  can also receive  anti-HAMA  agents  such  as  rituximab   and  cyclophosphamide.   They  
resume  treatment   with 3F8/GM -CSF if HAMA  becomes  negative.  
9.3 3F8/GM -CSF treatment   schedule  (one cycle).  
 
Days  -5 to -1: GM-CSF 250 mcg/m2/day,  subcutaneously.  
 
Days  0 and +1:   GM-CSF 250 mcg/m2/day,  subcutaneously.  
3F8 20 mg/m2/day by iv infusion over ~1.5 hr or less (usually  0.5  hr). 
 
Days  +2 to +4:   GM-CSF 500 mcg/m2/day,  subcutaneously.  
3F8 20 mg/m2/day by iv infusion over ~1.5 hr or less (usually  0.5  hr). 
 
Note:  The daily GM-CSF is not administered  if the ANC  is >20,000/ul.  The ANC  count  
from the previous  treatment  day will be used  to  determine   whether   GM-CSF  will  be 
administered   or  not.    If HAMA   develops,   cycles   are  deferred   until HAMA   titer  decreases  to 
<1000  Elisa units/ml.  Emla cream  (lidocaine  2.5%  and prilocaine  2.5%)  can be used to prevent  
pain from GM-CSF shots.  
 
9.4 Isotretinoin  is administered  at 160 mg/m2/d, divided  into  two doses,   x14 days.  
This treatment  can be repeated  after a minimum  rest period  of 14 days,  for a total of 6 cycles.  It 
is not taken  on the same  days as 3F8. All patients  receive  a minimum  of 2 cycles  of 3F8/GM - 
CSF before  starting  isotretinoin  (only  to be started  after cycle  1 if HAMA  develops   and 
precludes  timely  administration  of cycle  2).

12.6 Adequacy   of  trial:  All patients   who  fulfill the  eligibility  requirements   and  receive  
a first dose of 3F8 will have an adequate  trial. 
 
 
 
13.1 CRITERIA  FOR  REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
 
13.2 Group  1 patients  come  off study  if progressive  disease  develops  at any time after 
cycle  1. (see section  12.2).  
 
13.3 Group  2 patients  come  off study  if progressive  disease  develops  at any time after 
cycle  1 (see section  12.3).  
 
13.4 Life-threatening grade 4 toxicity clearly attributable  to 3F8. 
 
13.5 The investigators  will make  every  reasonable  effort  to keep  each patient   in the 
study  until all planned   treatments   and  assessments   have  been  performed.   The  investigators  
may discontinue   study  drug treatment   for the following  reasons:  
 
• Adverse  events , including  unacceptable  toxicity  or exacerbation  of underlying  disease,  
associated  with study  drug administration  and necessitating  discontinuation  of treatment.  
Patients  who are removed  from the study  due to adverse  events  will be  treated   and 
followed  according  to established,  acceptable  medical  practice.  All pertinent  information  
concerning  the outcome  of such treatment  will be entered  in the Case  Report  Form  or on 
the Serious  Event  Report,  as applicable.

• Withdrawal  of consent.  The patient's  desire  to withdraw  from the study  may occur  at 
any time. The investigator  should  carefullly consider  whether  the patient’s  withdrawal  of 
consent  is due to an adverse  event,  and if so, record  the adverse  event  as the reason  for 
withdrawal. 
 
• Withdrawal  by the physician  for clinical  reasons  not related  to study  drug treatment,  for 
example,  clinical  need to administer  a concomitant  medication  that is excluded  by the 
protocol,  in the absence  of an adverse  event.  
 
• Violation of the study protocol, including failure  to return for required treatments  or 
assessments.   Patients  who fail to return  for treatments   will be withdrawn  from the study  
if more  than 4 scheduled  doses  are missed  
 
13.6 Patients will not be removed from study in order to receive radiotherapy. 
 
 
14.0     BIOSTATISTICS  
 
Clinical  results:  This phase  II trial assesses  the anti-NB activity  of 3F8 plus sc GM-CSF.  
The response  endpoints  are CR of BM disease  for patients  with primary  refractory  NB (Group  
1), and two-year relapse -free survival  for patients  treated  in CR/VGPR  (Group  2). We expect  to 
accrue  15 patients  per year in each group.   This trial can be completed  within  3 years.  
 
Group  1: 3F8 plus iv GM-CSF (IRB  protocol  94-018) yielded  an overall  two-year 
relapse -free Kaplan -Meier  survival  probability  of 13% in 31 patients  with primary   refractory  
disease.  With  the new treatment  using  3F8 plus subcutaneous  GM-CSF,  we will consider  a two- 
year relapse -free survival  probability  of 0.13 as not promising  and 0.25 as promising.  For a one 
stage  design  with type I error  0.05 and 0.85 power,  70 patients  will be required.  If 12 or more  
patients  are relapse -free at two years,  the treatment  will be defined  as promising,  and an 
additional 15 patients (total: 85) will be enrolled  with the goal of strengthening the findings. 
 
Group  2: 3F8 plus iv GM-CSF (IRB  protocol  94-018) yielded  a two-year relapse -free 
Kaplan -Meier  survival  probability  of 55% for patients  treated  in first CR/VGPR.  With  the new 
treatment,  we consider  a two-year relapse -free survival  probability  of 0.55 as not promising  and 
1.70 as promising.  For a one stage  design  with type I error  0.05 and 0.85 power,  75 patients  will 
be required.  If 49 or more  patients  are relapse  free at two years,  the treatment  will be defined  as 
promising.  Two separate  cohorts  will be accrued:  75 patients  in first CR/VGPR  after transplant  
and 75 patients  in first CR/VGPR  after conventional  chemotherapy  + 13-cis-retinoic  acid and no 
transplant.  Up to 85 patients  in each cohort  will be accrued  with the aim of strengthening  the 
findings.  
Patients  treated  in >2nd remission,  long-term relapse -free survival  is <5%,  including   0/7 
treated  with 3F8 plus iv GM-CSF (all 7 relapsed  within  15 months).  Therefore,  we consider  a 
two-year relapse -free survival  probability  of 15% as promising  and 1% as  not  promising.  
Patients  will be divided  into two groups,  those  with and without   prior antibody  therapy:  
* For those  without  prior antibody  treatment  or other  immunotherapy,  Simon's  two- 
stage  optimal  design  will be used with a power  of 90% and an alpha  of 5%. For a total of 33

subjects,  18 will be accrued  during  stage  1 and 15 during  stage  2. The trial stops  early if none of 
the first 18 patients  survive  for two years  without  relapse.  Otherwise,  the trial continues  until 33 
patients  are accrued.  Treatment  will be considered  promising  if two or more  patients  experience  
two-year relapse -free survival  and accrual  can continue  up to 50 patients  with the goal of 
strengthening  the findings  
* Patients with prior antibody  treatment or immunotherapy are less common and so 
only a trial with lower  power  is feasible.  We will accrue  19 patients,  declaring  treatment   as 
promising  if two or more  experience  two-year relapse -free survival.  This design  has a power  of 
80% and an alpha  of 5%, a null hypothesis  of 1% and an alternate  hypothesis  of 15%.  Only  a 
one-stage  design  is feasible  with these  characteristics  as an observed  zero response  rate would  
consistent  with a true response  rate of 15% for an interim  analysis  conducted  at all possible  
stopping  points  up  to the 18th patient.  If the findings  are favorable,   accrual  can increase  to 35, 
with the aim of strengthening  the conclusions. 
* Patients  who went off protocol  to receive  therapy  for relapse  in  the  central  
nervous  system,  or to receive  additional  chemotherapy  because  of HAMA  (section  9.1), are not 
included   in the statistical   analyses  for these  groups.  
 
Utility  of RT-PCR:  The association  between  histologic  examination  and real time RT- 
PCR  regarding  BM status  can be assessed  by the Wilcoxon  statistic.  The clinical  significance  
(relapse -free survival)  of histologic  results  and real time RT-PCR  findings  in both groups  can be 
assessed  by log-rank test or Cox regression  model  or time dependent  Cox regression  model.

documentation will be available  to support the computerized  patient record. 
 
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor   patient  accruals  and 
completeness  of registration data.  Routine  data quality reports will be generated to assess 
missing data and inconsistencies.   Accrual rates and extext and accuracy of evaluations 
and follow -up  will be monitored   periodically  throughout   the study  period  and potential  
problems  will be brought  to the attention  of the study  team  for discussion  and action  
 
Random -sample   data quality  and protocol  compliance   audits  will be conducted  by the 
study  team,  at a minimum   of two times  per year, more  frequently  if indicated.  
 
16.3 Data and Safety  Monitoring  
 
Institutional  monitoring  plan for phase  I and phase  II trials:   Memorial   Sloan -Kettering  
Cancer Center (MSKCC) has established standard procedures for data safety monitoring 
of clinical  research  (see appendix).  For Phase  II trials,  these  procedures  include  
consideration  of accrual  rates,  toxicity,  adherence  to  dose-escalation  schedules,   adverse  
event  notification  and data recording.  Therapeutic  responses  are logged  on a central  
database  and approximately  50% are reviewed  by an independent  committee.  An annual  
report  of the trial’s  progress  is sent to the IRB. Alll   of the procedures  for Phase  II studies  
outlined  in MSKCC’s  policy  are applicable  to the current  trial and will be followed  by 
the investigators.  The analysis  of safety  will include  all patients  who receive  at least one 
dose of study  medication.  Adverse  events,  including  all toxic effects  of treatment,  will be 
tabulated  individually,  and summarized  by body  system,  according  to dosage  of study  
medication  (single  dose as well as cumulative  doses  of 3F8 and GM-CSF),  and according  
to severity  or toxicity  grade.  Laboratory  data will be tabulated  and summarized  by 
descriptive   statistics,   as well as on the basis of MSKCC  specified  normal  ranges.  
 
The policies  and procedures  for data safety  and monitoring  of clinical  research  at 
Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  are detailed  in Appendix  (Data  Safety  and 
Monitoring of Clinical  Research).

Detailed Title A phase IIIA, randomized, single -blind, multi -centric study  to 
evaluate the immunogenicity , reactogenicity  and safet y of 
three doses of Pediarix®, Hiberix® and Prevenar 13® when 
co-administered with two doses of the PCV -free liquid 
formulation of GSK Biologicals’ oral live attenuat ed HRV 
vaccine as compared to the currently licensed l yophilized 
formulation of the HRV vaccine in healthy  infants 6 -12 weeks 
of age.
Indication Active immunization of infants against gastroe nteritis (GE) 
due to rotavirus ( RV).
Rationale for the 
study and study 
designRationale for the stud y
Using advanced technology  in 2010, researchers from the 
University  of California, San Francisco identified 
Deox yribonucleic acid (DNA) fragments of Porcine circovirus 
type 1 (PCV- 1) in Rotarix . Further investigations conducted 
by GSK and the United States (US) Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) confirmed the presence of PCV -1 DNA 
fragments in Rotarix and its starting materials . Low levels of 
PCV -1 viral particles were also detected during theproduction 
process and in the fina l container. Retrospective laboratory  
investigations conducted by  GSK on 40 human rotavirus 
(HRV) vaccine recipients showed that none of the subjects 
who received the HRV vaccine demonstrated seroconversion 
to PCV -1, howe ver, PCV- 1 from the vaccine was identified in 
the stool samples of 4 infants from the HRV group (at Day  3 
and Day  7 post Dose 1). The detection of PCV- 1 DNA only  at 
the earliest time -points post -vaccination was consistent with 
transient passage of DNA thro ugh the infants’ digestive tracts 
without replication. Lack of PCV -1 infection is further 
supported by  the absence of anti -PCV -1 antibody  in the HRV 
vaccine recipients, including the infants who had PCV- 1 DNA 
detected in their stool samples [Dubin, 2013]. In a follow -up 
retrospective laboratory  analy sis of samples of 596 subjects, a 
post-vaccination anti -PCV -1 antibody  seropositivity  rate of 
1% [90% Confidence Interval ( CI): 0.3-2.6] in recipients of 
the human RV vaccine (3/299 samples) and 0.3% 
[90% CI : 0.0-1.6] in the placebo group (1/296 samples) was 
observed. The difference in the post -vaccination seropositivity  
and the seroconversion rates between the two study  groups 
were -0.66 [90% CI : -2.16-0.60] and -0.33 
[90% CI : -1.70–0.89], respectively . The 90 % CI for both 
group differences included 0, indicating that there was no 
statistically  significant increase as compared to the placebo

27-OCT -2016 8[Han, 2016] . Therefore, currentl y available data do esnot 
suggest occurrence of PCV- 1 infection in infants who 
received R otarix in clinical trials. These results are consistent 
with published literature which indicates that PCV- 1 is not 
capable of causing infection in humans [ Hattermann, 2004a; 
Hattermann, 2004b].
GSK hasreplac edthe cell bank and virus seeds used as base 
production material for its HRV vaccine . In accordance with 
the regulators, the company  continues to manufacture Rotarix
to the existing standards of approved production and quality ,
to meet public health needs worldwide.
This study  will assess if there is an y immune interference 
between the PCV -free liquid HRV vaccine and routine infant 
vaccinations currentl y in use in the US, namely Pediarix , 
Hiberix andPrevenar 13 as compared to the currently  
licensed lyophil ized formulation of the HRV vaccine when 
co-administered with the same routine vaccinations.
Rationale for the stud y design
The study  is designed as a randomized, controlled, 
single -blind study  with two parallel groups. This study will 
evaluate the i mmuno genicity , reactogenicity and safet yof the 
vaccines Pediarix , Hiberix and Prevenar 13 that are 
recommended for children in the US during the first y ear of 
life, when co -administered with the PCV -free liquid HRV 
vaccine as compared to the licensed l yophiliz ed vaccine.
The currently  licensed l yophilized Rotarix vaccine 
co-administered with routine infant vaccines in the US has 
been shown not to impair the immune response to any  of the 
co-administered antigens [Dennehy  2008]. Therefore, t he use 
of the currently  licensed ly ophilized vaccine as the control is 
considered appropriate . Furthermore, this study  design will 
avoid logistical constraints related to the inclusion of 
co-administration and separate administration of US routine 
infant vaccines in the same study .
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), 
consisting of clinical experts and a biostatistician will review 
the safet y data periodically to monitor the safet y aspects of the 
PCV -free liquid HRV vaccine.
This study  will have a single -blind design to ensure that the 
subject’s parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) 
(LARs )are not influenced by  the knowledge of the Rotarix
formulation when reporting safet y events and when

Objectives Co-Primary
To demonstrate the non -inferiorit y of the immune 
responses to three doses of Pediarix, Hiberix and 
Prevenar 13 when co -administered with two doses of the 
PCV -free liquid HRV vaccine, as compared to when co -
administered with the currently  license d lyophilized HRV 
vaccine, 1 month after Dose 3 of routine infant vaccines.
Criteria for non -inferiority : 
Lower limits of the two-sided standardized 
asymptotic 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on the 
differences between groups ( HRV Liq group minus 
HRV Lyo group) in the percentages of subjects with 
seroprotective concentrations ( 0.1 IU/mL) for each 
of anti -diphtheria (anti -D) and anti -tetanus (anti- T) 
antibodies are -10% (clinical limit for non-
inferiority),
The lower limit of the two-sided standardized 
asymptotic 95% CI on the difference between groups 
(HRV Liq group minus HRV Lyo group) in the 
percentages of subjects with seroprotective 
concentration ( 10 mIU/mL) for antibodies against 
hepatitis B surface antigen (anti- HBs) is -10% 
(clinical limit for non-inferiority),
Lower limits of the two-sided standardized 
asymptotic 95% CIs on the differences between 
groups (HRV Liq group minus HRV Lyo group) in 
the percentages of subjects with seroprotective titers 
(8 ED 50) for each of 
anti-poliovirus serotypes 1, 2 and 3 antibodies are
-5% (clinical limit for non -inferiority),
Lower limits of the two-sided 95% CIs on the 
geometric mean antibody concentrations (GMC) 
ratios ( HRV Liq group over HRV Lyo group) for 
antibodies against each of the pertussis toxoid ( PT), 
filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin 
(PRN) antigens [anti -PT, anti- FHA and anti -PRN]  
are 0.67 (clinical limit for non -inferiority),
Lower limits of the two-sided 95% CIs on the GMC 
ratios ( HRV Liq group over HRV Lyo group) for 
each of the 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.

To rule out a 10% decrease in seroresponse to PT, FHA 
and PRN antigen when Pediarix is co- administered with 
PCV-free-liquid HRV vaccine compared to when 
Pediarix is co- administered with the currently  licensed 
lyophilized HRV vaccine.
seroresponse is defined as the percentage of subjects 
showing an antibody  concentration above a threshold 
that leads to 95% serore sponse in the control group 
(lyophilized HRV vaccine) ,
p-value on the difference in seroresponse between 
groups is < 2.5% for each PT, FHA and PRN antigen 
(p-value is computed b y integrating on the p -value 
for the null hy pothesis that the seroresponse rate in 
the liquid group is < 85% and the a -posteriori 
probability  of the threshold in the ly ophilized group) .

Adverse event: Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject, temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related 
to the medicinal product. 
An adverse event (AE) can therefore be an y unfavourable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  
finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product. 
For marketed medicinal products, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i. e.,lack of 
efficacy ), abuse or misuse.
Blinding: A procedure in which one or more parties to the trial are 
kept unaware of the treatment assignment in order to 
reduce the risk of biased study outcomes. The level of 
blinding is maintained throughout the c onduct of the trial, 
and only  when the data are cleaned to an acceptable level 
of quality  will appropriate personnel be unblinded or 
when required in case of a serious adverse even t. In a 
single -blind study , the investigator and/or his staff are 
aware of t he treatment assignment but the subject is not .
Child in care: A child who has been placed under the control or 
protection of an agency , organisation, institution or entity  
by the courts, the government or a government body , 
acting in accordance with powe rs conferred on them by  
law or regulation. The definition of a child in care can 
include a child cared for by  foster parents or living in a 
care home or institution, provided that the arrangement 
falls within the definition above. The definition of a child
in care does not include a child who is adopted or has an 
appointed legal guardian.
Diarrh ea: Passage of three or more looser than normal stools within 
a day .
Eligible: Qualified for enrol lment into the study  based upon strict 
adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria.

27-OCT -2016 26End of Study (EoS) :
(Synonym of End of 
Trial)For studies without collection of human biological
samples or imaging data EoS is the Last Subject Last 
Visit (L SLV).
For studies with collection of Human Biologicals 
Samples or imaging data, EoS is defined as the date of 
the last testing/reading released of the Human Biological 
Samples or imaging data, related to primary  and 
secondary  endpoints. EoS must be achieved no later than 
8 months after L SLV.
Epoch: An epoch is a set of consecutive time -points or a single 
time-point from a single protocol. Epochs are defined to 
support a main purpose which is either to draw 
conclusions on subject participation or to draw a 
complete conclusion to define or precise the targeted 
label of the product. Supporting means that data collected 
at the time -points included in an epoch must be sufficient 
to fulfil the purpose of the epoch.
Typical examples of epochs are screenin g, primary  
vaccinations, boosters, yearl y immunogenicity 
follow -ups, and surveillance periods for efficacy  or 
safet y.
eTrack: GSK’s tracking tool for clinical trials.
Evaluable: Meeting all eligibility  criteria, compl ying with the 
procedures defined in the protocol, and, therefore, 
included in the per -protocol anal ysis (see S ections 6.7.2
and10.4 for details on criteria for evaluability ).
Gastroenteritis: Diarrh ea with or without vomiting.
Immunological correlate 
of protection:The defined immune response above which there is a high 
likelihood of protection in the absence of an y host factors 
that might increase susceptibility  to the infectious agent.
Investigational vaccine :
(Synonym of 
Investigational Medicinal 
Product [IMP] )A pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient being 
tested in a clinical trial, including a product with a 
marketing authorisation when used in a way  different 
from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved 
indication, or when used to gain further information about 
an approved use. 
Legally acceptable 
representative (LAR) :An individual or juridical or other bod y authorized under 
applicable law to consent, on behalf of a prospective

Primary completion 
date:The date tha t the final subject was examined or received 
an intervention for the purpose of final collection of data 
for all primary  outcomes, whether the clinical trial was 
concluded according to the pre -specified protocol or was 
terminated.
Randomiz ation: Process of random attribution of treatment to subjects in 
order to reduce bias of selection.
Self-contained study: Study  with objectives not linked to the data of another 
study .

27-OCT -2016 301. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Background
Rotavirus ( RV) infection is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis ( GE) and severe
diarrh eain infants and young children <5 years of age [ Atherl y,2009]. It has been 
estimated that in 2013, approximately  215,000 deaths were caused due to RV. India, 
Nigeria, Pakistan, a nd Democratic Republic of Congo, accounted for approximately  half 
(49%) of all the es timated RV deaths in 2013 [Tate, 2016].
Although RV infection rarel y causes death in Europe, North Americ a and Australia, it 
remains the most common cause of hospitalization for GE in children
[Desselberger , 2012]. In developed countries, RV infection remains the most common 
cause of hospitaliz ation for GE in children and leads to major m edical and societal costs . 
Over the last man y years, the development of vaccines has been beneficial in the 
prevention of considerable morbidity  and mortality due to RV. Two live or al HRV
vaccines have been licensed in many  countries; one is derived from an attenuated human 
strain of RV and the other combines fi vebovine -human reassortant strains [Glass , 2006]. 
Each of these vaccine shave been proven highl y effective in preventing severe RV
diarrh ea by  substantially  reducing thenumber and the asso ciated costs of child 
hospitaliz ations and clini cal visits for acute diarrhea in children. Moreover, these 
vaccines could reduce deaths from diarrh ea and improve child survival through programs
such as childhood immuni zations and diarrh eal disease control in developing countries. 
The World He alth Organi sation (WHO) recognis es HRV vaccination as an effective 
measure to prevent RV infection and to reduce disease burden, and recommends its 
inclusion into all national infant immuniz ation programs, particularly  in countries where 
RV GE associated fatality rates are high among children aged <5 years (e.g., south and 
south- eastern Asia and sub- Saharan Africa) [WHO position paper , 2013].
GlaxoSmithKl ine (GSK) Biologicals’ H RVvaccine (Rotarix™) is a vaccine for oral use, 
containing the live attenuated human rotavirus (HRV) RIX4414 strain. It has previousl y 
been observed tha t infants aged younger than three months who received the vaccine did 
not develop diarrh ea, vomiting or fever during the trial [Vesikari , 2004(a) ]. The initial 
trials that GSK conducted in Finland showed safety , immunogenicity  and efficacy  of the 
Rotarix vaccine [ Vesikari ,2004(b)]. InLatin America n and European studies, vaccine 
efficacy  of oral live attenuated HRV vaccine Rotarix was high, ranging from 80.5% to 
90.4% against severe RVGE, and 83.0% to 96.0% against hospitaliz ation due to RV GE 
during the first two y ears of life.[ Vesikari , 2007; Linhares , 2008]. Furthermore , resul ts 
from a phase III clinical study  undertaken in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan showed 
that during the first two years of life, two doses of Rotarix vaccine provided a high level 
of protection against severe RV GE (vaccine efficacy : 96.1%), and had a saf ety profile 
similar to the placebo [Phua , 2012]. Such safet y and efficacy studies in Europe, Latin 
America and Asia have confirmed that the vaccine is safe, well -tolerated and efficacious 
(range: 80- 96%) in preventing severe RVGEin the first two y ears of life 
[Cunliffe , 2014].

27-OCT -2016 31Rotarix is registered in at least 130 countries and more than 300 million doses of the 
vaccine (lyophilized and liquid formulations) are estimated to have been distributed 
worldwide si nce its launch until July  2016.
Please refer to the current I nvestigator Brochure (IB) for information regarding the pre -
clinical and clinical studies andthe epidemiological information of Rotarix vaccine .
1.2. Rationale for the study  and study  design
1.2.1. Rational e for the study
Using advanced technology in 2010, researchers from the University  of California, San 
Francisco identified Deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) fragments of Porcine circovirus t ype 1 
(PCV -1) in Rotarix . Further investigation s conducted by  GSK and the United States (US) 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed the presence of PCV -1 DNA fragments 
in Rotarix and its starting materials . Low levels of PCV -1 viral particles were also 
detected during theproduction process and in the final container. Retrospective 
laboratory  investigations conducted by GSK on 40 HRV vaccine recipients showed that 
none of the subjects who received the HRV vaccine demonstrated seroconversion to 
PCV -1, however, PCV -1 from the vaccine was identified in the stool sampl es of 4 infants 
from the HRV group (at Day  3 and Day  7 post Dose 1). The detection of PCV -1 DNA 
only at the earliest time -points post -vaccination was consistent with transient passage of 
DNA through the infants’ digestive tracts without replication. Lack o f PCV -1 infection is 
further supported b y the absence of anti -PCV -1 antibody  in the HRV vaccine recipients, 
including the infants who had PCV- 1 DNA detected in their stool samples [ Dubin, 2013]. 
In a follow -up retrospective laboratory  anal ysis of samples of 596 subjects, a 
post-vaccination anti -PCV -1 antibody  seropositivity  rate of 1% [90% Confidence Interval 
(CI): 0.3-2.6] in recipients of the human RV vaccin e (3/299 samples) and 0.3% 
[90% CI : 0.0-1.6] in the placebo group (1/296 samples) was observed. The difference in
the post -vaccination seropositivity  and the seroconversion rates between the two study  
groups were -0.66 [90% CI : -2.16- 0.60] and - 0.33 [90% CI: -1.70–0.89], respectively . 
The 90% CI for both group differences included 0, indicating that there was no 
statistically  significant increase as compared to the placebo [ Han, 2016]. Therefore, 
currentl y available data do esnot suggest occurrence of PCV- 1 infection in infants who 
received Rotarix in clinical trials .These results are consistent with published literature 
which indicates that PCV-1 is not capable of causing infection in humans [ Hattermann, 
2004a; Hattermann, 2004b].
GSK hasreplac edthe cell bank and virus seeds used as base production material for its 
HRV vaccine . In accordance with the regulators, the compan y continues to manufacture 
Rotarix to the existing standards of approved production and quality ,to meet public 
health needs worldwide.
This study  will assess if there is an y immune interference between the PCV -free liquid 
HRV vaccine and routine infant vaccinations currently  in use in the US, namely  Pediarix , 
Hiberix and Prevenar 13 as compared to the currently  licensed lyophilized formulation of 
the HRV vaccine when co -administered with the same routine vaccinations.

27-OCT -2016 321.2.2. Rationale for the study  design
The study  is designed as a randomized, controlled, single -blind study  with two parallel 
groups. This study will evaluate the i mmunogenicity , reactogenicit yand safety of the 
vaccines Pediarix , Hiberix and Prevenar 13 that are recommen ded for children in the US
during the first y ear of life , when co -administered with the PCV -free liquid HRV vaccine 
as compared to the licensed ly ophilized vaccine.
The currently  licensed l yophilized Rotarix vaccine co- administered with routine infant 
vaccines in the US has been shown not to impair the immune response to any  of the 
co-administered antigens [ Dennehy , 2008]. Therefore, t he use of the currently  licensed 
lyophilized vaccine as the control is considered appropriate . Furthermore, this study  
design will avoid logistical constraints related to the inclusion of co -administration and 
separate administration of US routine infant v accines in the same study .
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), consisting of clinical experts and a 
biostatistician will review the safet y data periodically to monitor the safety aspects of the 
PCV -free liquid HRV vaccine.
This study  will have a single -blind design to ensure that the s ubject’s parent(s)/Legall y 
Acceptable Representative(s) (LARs) are not influenced b y the knowledge of the Rotarix
formulation when reporting safet y events and when complying with the study procedure .

By receiving the HRV vaccine the subject may become protected against RVdisease. In 
addition,the subject’s participation will benefit other children in the future since 
information collected during this study  will help in the evaluation of PCV -free HRV 
vaccine co-administration with routinely  administered childhood vaccines .
Routine childho od vaccinations Pediarix , Hiberix and Prevenar 13will be administered 
to subjects according to their prescribed vaccination schedule, as part of the study .
In addition, the subjects will undergo a history directed ph ysical examination at the first 
study  visit. I n case the study  doctor discovers any medical condition, the subject will be 
referred to the local healthcare s ystem.
1.3.3. Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion
Considering the measures taken to minimize therisk to subjects participating in this 
study , the potential or identified risks in as sociation with theHRVvaccine are justified 
by thepotential benefits (prevention /treatment) that may  be afforded to subjects receiving 
the vaccine for immunization against RV.

5.2.1. Subject identification
Subject identification numbers will be assigned sequentially to the subjects whose 
parent(s)/LAR(s) have consented to their participation in the study , according to the range 
of subject identification number s allocated to each study  center .
5.2.2. Randomization of treatment
5.2.2.1. Randomization of supplies
The numbering of HRV vaccine supplies will be performed at GSK Biologicals, using a 
block scheme randomiz ation in MATerial EXce llence (MATEX), a program developed 
for use in Statistical Analy sis Sy stem (SAS®) (Cary , NC, US ) by GSK Biologicals . Entire 
blocks will be shipped to the study  center s/warehouse(s).
To allow GSK Biologicals to take advantage of greater rates of recruitment than 
anticipated at individual centers in this multi -center study  and to thus reduce the overall 
study  recruitment period, an over -randomiz ation of supplies will be prepared. 
5.2.2.2. Treatment allocation to the subject
The treatment n umbers will be allocated by  dose .
5.2.2.2.1. Study group and treatment number allocation
The target wi ll be to enrol 128 0 eligible subjects who w ill be randomly  assigned to two
study  groups in a (1: 1) ratio (approximately  640 subjects in each group).
Allocation of the subject to a study  group at the investigator site will be performed using 
SBIR. The randomiz ation algorithm will use a minimiz ation procedure accounting f orthe
centerand the study as minimization factors. Minimization factors will have equal weight 
in the minimization algorithm.
After obtaining the signed and dated ICF from the subject’s pare nt/LAR and having 
checked the eligibility  of the subject, the site staff in charge of the vaccine administration 
will access SBI R. Upon providing the subject ide ntification number, the randomiz ation 
system will determine the study  group and will provide the treatment number to be used 
for the first dose .
The number of each administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine 
Administration screen.
When SBI R is not available , please refer to the SBIR user guide or the Study  Procedures 
Manual (SPM) for specific instructions.

5.3. Method of blinding 
This study  is single -blind where the investigator and/or his staff will be aware of the 
treatment assignment and the subject’s parents/LARs will not be aware of the treatment 
assignment .
The laboratory  in charge of the laboratory  testin g will be blinded to the treatment, and 
codes will be used to link the subject and stud y (without any link to the treatment 
attributed to the subject) to each sample.
5.4. General study  aspects
Supplementary  study  conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is 
provided in the accompany ing SPM. The SPM provides the investigator and the site

methods, as well as making sure that new tests are comparable to previous methods 
and work reliably .
It is also possible that future findings may  make it desirable to use the samples 
acquired in this study  for future research, not described in this protocol. Therefore, 
all subjects in countries where this is allowed will be asked to give a specific consent
to allow GSK or a contracted partner to use the samples for future research. Future 
research will be subject to the laws and regulations in the US and will only  be 
performed once an IECor Review Board has approved this research.
Information on further investigatio ns and their rationale can be obtained from GSK 
Biologicals.
Any sample testing will be done in line with the co nsent of the individual subject’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s) .
Refer also to the Investigator Agreement , where it is noted that the investigator cannot 
perform an y other biological assay s except those described in the protocol or its 
amendment(s). 
If additional testing is performed, th e marker priority  ranking given in Section 5.7.4 may 
be changed.
Collected samples will be stored for a maximum of 20 y ears (counting from when the last 
subject performed the last study  visit), unless local rules, regulations or guidelines require 
different timeframes or different procedures, which will then be in line with the subject 
consent. These extra requirements need to be communicated formall yto and discussed 
and agreed with GSK Biologicals.
5.7.1. Use of specified study materials
When materials are provided by  GSK Biologicals, it is MANDATORY that all clinical 
samples (including serum samples) be collected and stored exclusively  using those 
material s in the appropriate manner. The use of other materials could result in the 
exclu sion of the subject from the per -protocol analy sis (See Section 10.4 for the 
definition of cohorts to be anal yzed). The investigator must ensure that his/her personnel 
and the laboratory (ies) under his/her supervision comply  with this requirement. However, 
when GSK Biologicals does not provide material for collecting and storing clinical 
samples, appropriate materials from the investigator’s site must be used. Refer to the 
Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM.
5.7.2. Biological sample

5.7.5. Immunological correlates of protection
The following cut -offs are accepted as immunological cor relates of protection:
Specific antibodies against diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid will be measured b y 
Enzy me Linked Immunosorbent Assay  (ELISA ). The assay  cut-offs for anti -D and 
anti-T is currentl y set at 0.1 IU/mL  (ELISA), which provides a conserva tive estimate 
of the percentage of subjects deemed to be protected [ Camargo , 1984; Melville -
Smith , 1983] . 
Antibodies to the anti-HBs will be measured using CLIA . The cut -off of the test is 
set at 6.2 mIU/mL . An antibody  concentration 10mIU/mL defines seroprotection 
[CDC , 1991; WHO , 1988].
Antibodies against poliovirus ty pes 1, 2 and 3 will be determined b y a virus micro -
neutrali zation test adapted from the World Health Organiz ation Guidelines for 
WHO/EPI  Collaborative Studies on Poliomy elitis [WHO , 1993]. The lowest dilution 
at which serum samples will be test ed is 1:8, from which a test will be considered 
positive. Titer s will be expressed in terms of the re ciprocal of the dilution resulting in 
50% inhibition. Antibody titers greater than or equal to this value are considered as 
protective.
Data from subjects given unconjugated Hib vaccine suggest that, in the absence of 
induction of immunological memory , a concentration of 0.15 g/mL  is indicative of 
short -term protection, with 1  g/mL considered indicative of long -term protection 
[Käyhty, 1983; Anderson , 1984].
No correlate of protection is defined for the immune response to pertussis antigens. 
Antibodies against the pertussis components PT, FHA and PRN will be measured b y 
ELISA technique. The current cut-offsfor all three pertussis antibodies arethe

2.693 IU/mL for PT, 2.046 IU/mL for FHA and 2.187 IU/mL for PRN . Subjects with 
antibody  concentration below this cut -off will be considered seronegative.
Pneumococcal serot ype specific total I gG antibodies (antibodies against 1, 3, 4, 5, 
6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19 A, 19F and 23F) will each be measured by multiplex 
ElectroChemiLuminescence (ECL) assay s. The LLOQ (in µg/mL) determined for 
each of these strains are shown in Table 7. No correlate of protection is defined for 
the immune response to pneumococcal antigens .
No immunological correlate of protection has been demonstrated so far for the 
antigen used as part of the HRV vaccine.
The investigator is encouraged to share the immunological assay  results for non-
responders with the study  subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s).
For the subjects identified as non- responders, it remains the responsibility  of the 
investiga tor in charge of the subject’s clinical management to determine the medical need 
for re -vaccination and to re -vaccinate the subjects as per local/regional practices.

6.2. Storage and handling of study  vaccine s
The study  vaccine s must be stored at the respective label storage temperature conditions 
in a safe and locked place. Access to the storage s pace should be limited to authorized 
study  personnel. The storage conditions will be assessed during pre- study  activities under 
the responsibility  of the sponsor study  contact. The storage temperature should be 
continuously  monitored with calibrated (if no t validated) temperature monitoring 
device(s) and recorded. Refer to the Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM for 
more details on storage of the study  vaccine s.
Temperature excursions must be reported in degree Celsius.
Any temperature excursion ou tside the range of 0.0 to +8.0 C (for +2 to +8°C/+36 to 
+46°F label storage condition) impacting investigational medicinal products (I MPs) must 
be reported in the appropriate (electronic) temperature excursion decision form ([e]TDF). 
The impacted IMPs must not be used and must be stored in quarantine at label 
temperature conditions until usage approval has been obtained from the sponsor .
In case of temperature excursion below +2.0°C down to 0.0°C impacting IMP(s) there is 
no need to report in (e)TDF, but ad equate actions must be taken to restore the +2 to 
+8°C/+36 to +46°F label storage temperature conditions. The impacted I MP(s) may  still 
be administered, but the site should avoid re -occurrence of such temperature excursion.

6.3. Dosage and administration of stud y vaccines
Liquid formulation of HRV vaccine
The pre -filled oral applicator is shaken well before use. The vaccine (approximately  
1.5 mL ) should then be administered orally  as a single dose. 
Lyophilized formulation of HRV vaccine
To prepare GSK Biologicals' HRV ly ophilized vaccine for administration, the entire 
content of the supplied diluent (calcium carbonate buffer) should be transferred from the 
oral applicator into the vial of the ly ophilized product via the intermediate device. The 
vialshould be shaken well to resuspend the vaccine. The entire volume of the 
resuspended product (approximately  1 mL) should be withdrawn into the same oral 
applicator and the resuspended product should then be administer ed promptly  as a single 
oral dose.
Administration of the oral vaccines
In order to allow the swallowing of the entire volume of the single oral dose (of liquid or 
lyophilized formulation), the administration should occur in a quiet environment. The 
child s hould be seated in a reclining position. Administer orally  (i.e., into the child’s 
mouth towards the inner cheek) the entire content of oral applicator. Sufficient time 
should be allowed for the baby  to swallow the vaccine solution, to avoid regurgitation or 
vomiting. If regurgitation or vomiting occurs after vaccination, a single replacement dose 
may be given at the same vaccination visit . This information should be recorded in the 
eCRF. The subject may  continue to participate in the study . 
Administration of the intramuscular vaccines
In order to ensure proper IM injection of the co-administered vaccines, a needle of at 
least 1 inch (2.54 cm) length, 25 gauge will be used [ Diggle , 2006; Zuckerman , 2000].
The vaccinees will be observed closel y for at least 30 minutes, with appropriate medical 
treatment readily  available in case of a rare anaph ylactic reaction following the 
administrati on of vaccines.
The vaccination regimen is summarized in Table 10.

6.5. Contraindications to subsequent vaccination
The following events constitute absolute contraindications to further administration of the 
study  vaccines. If any  ofthese events occur during the study , the subject must not receive 
additional doses of vaccine sbut may  continue other study  procedures at the discretion of 
the investigator (see Section 8.5). 
Anaph ylaxis followin g the administration of vaccine (s).
Hypersensitivity  reaction followi ng the administration of the vaccine (s).
Any uncorrected congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract (such as 
Meckel’s diverticulum ) that would predispose for IS.
Any history  of IS.
SCID.
Any condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make intramuscular 
injection unsafe.
Contraindication for pertussis-containing vaccines: 
Encephalopath y of unknown etiology , defined as an acute, severe central 
nervous s ystem disorder ,occurring within 7 day s following previous vaccination 
with pertussis -containing vaccine and generall y consisting of major alterations 
in consciousness, unresponsiveness, generalized or focal seizures that persist 
more than a few hours, with failure to recover within 24 hours.

the condition has stabilized.
Refer to the approved product label/package insert s for warnings and precau tions for the 
use of Pediarix, Prev enar13, Rotarix (currently  licensed l yophilized HRV vaccine) and 
Hiberix vaccines.
The following events constitute contraindications to administration of the study  vaccines
at that point in time; if any  of these events oc cur at the time scheduled for vaccination, 
the subject may  be vaccinated at a later date, within the time window specified in the 
protocol (see Section 5.5), or the subject may  be withdrawn at the discretion of the 
investigator (see Section 8.5). 
Acute disease and/or fever at the time of vaccinat ion. 
Fever is defined as temperature 38.0°C/ 100.4°F . The preferred location for 
measuring temperature in this study  will be the oral cavity , the axilla and the 
rectum.
Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrh ea, mild upper respiratory 
infection) without fever may  be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.
GE within 7 day spreceding the HRV vaccine administration .
6.6. Warnings and precautions
The HRV vaccine should under no circumstances be injected.
There are no data on the safet y and efficacy of Rotarix in infants with gastrointestinal 
illnesses. Administration of Rotarix may be considered with caution in such infants when, 
in the opinion of the physician, withholding the vaccine entails a greater ri sk.
Post-marketing safet y data indicate a transient increased risk of ISafter vaccination, 
mostly  within 7 day sfollowing the administration of the first dose of Rotarix and, to a 
lesser extent, the second dose. The overall incidence of IS remains rare. Whether Rotarix
affects the overall risk of IShas not been established.
Therefore, parents/LARs should be advised to promptly  report any  symptoms indicative 
of IS(severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bloody  stools, abdominal bloating
and/or high fever).
Excretion of the vaccine virus in the stools is known to occur after vaccination and lasts 
for 10 day s on average with peak excretion around the 7th day . In clinical trials, cases of 
transmission of excreted vaccine virus to seronegati ve contacts of vaccines have been 
observed without causing any  clinical s ymptoms. Rotarix should be administered with 
caution to individuals with immunodeficient close contacts, such as individuals with 
malignancies, or who are otherwise immunocompromi sed or receiving 
immunosuppressive therapy. Contacts of recent vaccine es should be advised to observe 
careful hy giene ( including wash ingtheir hands) when changing child ren’s diaper s.

Each subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will be in structed to contact the investigator immediately  
should they /the subject manifest any  signs or s ymptoms they  perceive as serious.
8.1. Safet y definitions
8.1.1. Definition of an adverse event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject , temporall y 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exa cerbated) temporall y associated with 
the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. ,lack of efficacy ), abuse or misuse. 
Examples of an AE include:
Significant or unexpected w orsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication 
under study .
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after study vaccines administration even 
though they  may  have been present prior to the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
vaccine s or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an 
AE/SAE).
Signs, sy mptoms temporally  associated with study  vaccines administration.
Significant failure of expected pharmacological or biological action. 
Pre-or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol- mandated procedures 
(i.e.,invasive procedures, modification of subject’s previous therapeutic regimen).
AEs to be recorded as endpoints (solicited AEs) are described in Section 8.1.3 . All other 
AEs will be recorded as UNSOLI CITED AEs.

27-OCT -2016 63Examples of an AE DO NOT include:
Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., endoscop y, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE/SAE.
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g., social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital, admission for routine examination).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen .
Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or s ymptoms present in a subject prior to the 
study  vaccination. These events will be recorded in the med ical history  section of the 
eCRF.
8.1.2. Definition of a serious adverse event 
A SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence that:
a.Results in death,
b.Is life -threatening,
Note: The term ‘life-threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which h ypothetically  might have caused death, had it been more severe.
c.Requires hospitaliz ation or pro longation of existing hospitaliz ation,
Note: I n general, hospitaliz ation signifies that the subject has been admitted at the 
hospital or emergency  ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or in an out -patient setting. Complicati ons 
that occur during hospitaliz ation are also considered AEs. If a complica tion prolongs 
hospitaliz ation or fulfils any other serious criteria, the event will also be considered 
serious. When in d oubt as to whether ‘hospitaliz ation’ occurred or was necessary , the 
AE should be considered serious.
Hospitaliz ation for elective treat ment of a pre-existing condition (known or 
diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is 
NOT considered an AE.
d.Results in disability /incapacity , OR
Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated hea dache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrh ea, influenza like illness, and accidental trauma (e.g. ,sprained ankle) 
which may  interfere or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a

All AEs starting within 31days following administration of Dose 1 an d Dose 2 of the 
HRV vaccine (Day 1to Day  31) must be recorded into the appropriate section of the 
eCRF, irrespective of intensity  or whether or not they  are considered vaccination -related.
The time period for collecting and recording SAEs will begin at th e receipt of study  
vaccines until the subject is discharged from the study. See Section 8.4 for instructions on 
reporting of SAEs.
All AEs/SAEs leading to withdrawal from the study  will be collected and recorded from 
the time of the receipt of study  vaccine s.
In addition to the above -mentioned reporting requirements and in order to fulfil 
international reporting obligations, SAEs that are related to study  participation (i.e. ,
protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, a change from existing therapy ) or are 
related to a concurrent GSK medication/vaccine will be collected and recorded from the 
time the subject consents to participate in the study  until she/he is discharged from the 
study .
An overview of the protocol -required reporting periods for AEs and SAEs is given in

27-OCT -2016 67When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to re view all 
documentation (e.g. ,hospital progress notes, laboratory  and diagnostics reports) relative 
to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an 
AE/SAE in the eCRF. T he investigator is not allowed to send photocopies of the subject’s 
medical records to GSK Biologicals instead of appropriatel y completing the eCRF. 
However, there may  be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are 
requested b y GSK Biologicals. In this instance, all subject identifiers will be blinded on 
the copies of the medical records prior to submission to GSK Biologicals.
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event based on 
signs, s ymptoms, and/or other clinical information. I n such cases, the dia gnosis should be 
documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/sy mptoms.

The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the 
event for all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded durin g the stud y. The assessment 
will be based on the investigator’s clinical judgement.
The intensity  should be assigned to one of the following categories:
1 (mild) =An AE which is easil y tolerated b y the subject, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interferi ng with every day activities.
2 (moderate) =An AE which is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with 
normal every day activities.
3 (severe) =An AE which prevents normal, every day activities 
(In a young child, such an AE would, for example, preve nt 
attendance at a day-care center and would cause the 
parent(s)/LAR(s) to seek medical advice.)
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 
3 is a category  used for rating the intensit y of an event; and both AEs an d SAEs can be 
assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre -
defined outcomes as described in Section 8.1.2.

27-OCT -2016 698.3.3.2.2. Assessment of causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the rel ationship between study  vaccine sand the 
occurrence of each AE/SAE using clinical judgement. I n case of concomitant 
administration of multiple vaccines/products, if possible, the investi gator should specify  
if the AE could be causally  related to a specific vaccine/product administered (i.e.,
investigational, control/placebo or co -administered vaccine). When causal relationship to 
a specific vaccine(s)/product(s) cannot be determined the i nvestigator should indicate the 
AE to be related to all products.
Alternative plausible causes, such as natural history of the underl ying diseases, 
concomitant therap y, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the 
study  vaccines will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the 
IB and/or and/or SmPC and/or Prescribing Information for marketed products to 
determine his/her assessment.
There may  be situations when a SAE has occurred and the investigator has m inimal 
information to include in the initial report to GSK Biologicals. However, it is very  
important that the investigator alway s makes an assessment of causality  for every  event 
prior to submission of the Expedited Adverse Events Report to GSK Biological s. The 
investigator may  change his/her opinion of causality  in light of follow -up information and 
update the SAE information accordingl y. The causality assessment is one of the criteria 
used when determining regulatory  reporting requirements.
Causality  of allAEs should be assessed b y the investigator using the following question:
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the study vaccine ?
YES :There is a reasonable possibility  that the study vaccine scontributed 
to the AE. 
NO :There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally  related to 
the administration of the study  vaccines. There are other, more 
likely  causes and administration of the study  vaccine sis not 
suspected to have contributed to the AE.
If an event m eets the criteria to be determined as ‘serious’ (see Section 8.1.2 ), additional 
examinations/tests will be performed b y the investigator in order to determine ALL 
possible contributing factors for each SAE.
Possible contributing factors include:
Medical history .
Other medication.
Protocol required procedure.
Other procedure not required by  the protocol.
Lack of efficacy  of the vaccine s, if applicable.

Once an investigator becomes aware that a SAE has occurred in a study subject, the 
investigator (or designate) must complete the information in the electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report WITHIN 24 HOURS. The report will always be completed as thoroughly as possible with all available details of the event. Even if the investigator does not have all information regarding a SAE, the report should still be completed within 24 hours. Once additional relevant information is received, the report should be updated WITHIN 24 HOURS.
The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial 
report. The investigator will be required to confirm the review of the SAE causality by ticking the ‘reviewed’ box in the electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report within 72 hours of submission of the SAE.
8.4.3.1. Back-up system in case the electronic reporting system does not work

Biologicals Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance department within 24 hours. 
This back-up system should only be used if the electronic reporting system is not working 
and NOT if the system is slow. As soon as the electronic reporting system is working again, the investigator (or designate) must complete the electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report within 24 hours. The final valid information for regulatory reporting will be the information reported through the electronic SAE reporting system.

designated reporting time frames specified in Table 15.
8.4.5. Regulatory  reporting requirements for serious adve rse events
The investigator will promptly  report all SAEs to GSK in accordance with the procedures 
detailed in Section 8.4.1. GSK Biologicals has a legal responsibility  to promptly  notify , 
as appropriate, both the local regulatory  authorit y and other regulatory  agencies about the 
safet y of a product under clinical investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by  the 
investigator to the Stud y Contact for Reporting SAEs is essential so that legal obligations 
and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of other subjects are met.
Investigator safety  reports are prepared according to the current GSK policy  and are 
forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator safet y report is prepared for a 
SAE(s) that is both attributable to the study vaccine s and unexpected. The purpose of the 
report is to fulfil specific regulatory  and GCP requirements, regarding the product under 
investigation.
8.5. Follow -up of adverse events and serious adverse events
8.5.1. Follow -up during the study
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each 
subject and provide additional relevant information on the subject’s condition to GSK
Biologicals (within 24 hours for SAEs; refer to Table 15).
All SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact and designated as not recovered/not 
resolve d or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts until the 
last visit of the subject.
All AEs documented at a previous visit/contact and designated as not recovered/not

has resolved, s ubsided, stabilised, disappeared, or until the event is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
If the investigator receives additional relevant information on a previousl y reported SAE, 
he/she will provide this information to GSK Biolog icals using a paper/ electronic 
Expedited Adverse Events Report and/or pregnancy  report as applicable.
GSK Biologicals may  request that the investigator performs or arranges the conduct of 
additional clinical examinations/tests and/or evaluations to elucida te as fully  as possible 
the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The investigator is obliged to assist. I f a 
subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognised follow -up period, 
GSK Biologicals will be provided with an y available post -mortem findings, including 
histopathology .
8.6. Treatment of adverse events
Treatment of an y AE is at the sole discretion of the investigator and according to current 
good medical practice . Any medication admi nistered for the treatment of a SAE should 
be rec orded in the subject’s eCRF (refer to Section 6.7).
8.7. Subject card
Study  subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) must be provided with the address and telephone 
number of the main contact for information about the clinical study .
The investigator (or designate) must therefore provide a “subject card” to each subject’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s). In an emergency situation this card serves to inform the responsible 
attending phy sician that the subject is in a clinical study  and that relevant information 
may be obtained by  contacting the investigator.
Subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) must be instructed to keep subject cards in their possession at 
all times during the stud y duration.

From an anal ysis perspective, a ‘withdrawal’ from the study  refers to any  subject who
wasnot available for the concluding contact foreseen in the protocol. 
All data collected until the date of withdrawal/last contact of the subject will be used for
the anal ysis.
A subject is considered a ‘withdrawal’ from the study  when no study  procedure has 
occurred, no follow -up has been performed and no further information has been collected 
for this subject from the date of withdrawal/last contact.
Investigator s will make an attempt to contact those subjects who do not return for 
scheduled visits or follow -up.
Information relative to the withdrawa l will be documented in the eCRF . The investigator 
will document whether the decision to withdraw a subject from the study  was made b y 
the subject’s parent(s) /LAR(s ), or b y the investigator, as well as which of the following 
possible reasons was responsible for withdrawal:
SAE
Unsolicited non- serious AE
Solicited AE
Protocol violation (specify )
Consent withdrawal, not du e to an AE*
Moved from the stud y area
Lost to follow -up
Other (specify )
*In case a subject is withdrawn from the study  because he/she/the subject’s 
parent(s) /LAR(s) has withdrawn consent, the investigator will document the reason for 
withdrawal of consent, if specified by  the subject /subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) , in the 
eCRF .
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study  because of SAEs/AEs must be clearl y 
distinguished from subjects who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators will 
follow subjects who are withdrawn from the study as result of a SAE/AE until resolution 
of the event (see Section 8.5.2).

10.3. Determination of sample size
The target sample size is 832 subjects evaluable for i mmunogenicit y analyses at Visit 4 
(416 subjects in each group). Assuming that approximately  35% of enrolled subjects 
might withdraw or not be evaluable for analy ses of immunogenicit y, the target sample 
size to be enrolled is 1280 subjects (640 subjects in each group).
The primary  objective of this study  is to demonstrate the immune response elicited to all 
antigens contained in each of the routine infant vaccines Pediarix , Hiberix and
Prevenar 13when co- administered with PCV -free l iquid HRV vaccine is non- inferior to 
that elicited when co -administered with the ly ophilized HRV vaccine .

A 2.5% nominal type I error will be used for each co -primary  evaluation. To control the 
type I error below 2.5%, a hierarchica l procedure will be used for the multiple study  
objectives. That is, an objective will be reached if its associated criterion is met and the 
previous objectives were reached. The same order in which the study  objectives are listed 
in Section 2.1will be considered for h ypothesis testing.
The sample size has been estimated in order to obtain at least 90% power to demonstrate 
the co -primary  objectives. The power associated with the target sample size for the 
conclusion on each inferential objective of this study  is detailed in Section 10.3.3.

10.3.3. Power computation
The sample size has been estimated in order to obtain at least 90% power to demonstrate 
the primary  objective s(Bonferroni adjustment of type II error). A hierarchical procedure 
will be used for the multiple study  objectives. That is, an objective will be reached if its 
associated criterion is met and the previous objectives were reached. The same order in 
which the study  objectives are listed in Section 2.1will be considered for hy pothesis 
testing.
The power computations were based on the following methods:
Non-inferiorit y on percentage of subjects with titer/concentration above pre -specified 
cut-off: Ty pe II error is obtained using PASS 2005, one -sided non- inferiority  test for 
two proportions, under the alternative of equal proportions (Miettinen and Nurminen 
method).
Non-inferiorit y on GMC: Ty pe II error is obtained using PASS 2005, one -sided 
non-inferiorit y test for two from norma l data with common variance, under the

10.9. Interpretation of analy ses
Except for anal yses addressing criteria specified in the co-primar y objective sreferred as 
confirmatory  anal yses, all the anal yses will be descriptive/ exploratory  in nature . The use 
of these descriptive/ exploratory  analy ses should be limited to support the confirmatory  
analyses or to generate hy pothesis .
10.9.1. Statistical methods
The exact 95% CIs for a proportion within a group will be based on the method by  
Clopper [ Clopper , 1934].
The standardized as ymptotic CI  for the group difference in proportion is the method 
6 described in the Newcombe paper [Newcombe , 1998]
The 95% CIs of the group GMC/GMT ratios w ill be computed using an ANOVA 
model on the logarithm10 transformation of the concentrations/titers. The ANOVA 
model will include the vaccine group as fixed effect s.In addition ,for anti-HBs, the 
model will include the Hepatitis B vaccination history  as co-variable .
The 95% CI for GMTs/GMCs will be obtained within each group separately . The 
95% CI  for the mean of log -transformed titer/concentration will be first obtained 
assuming that log -transformed values were normally  distributed with unknown 
variance. The 95% CI for the GMTs/GMCs will then be obtained b y exponential -
transformation of the 95% CI  for the mean of log- transformed titer/concentration.

Rotavirus Ab.IgA Determination
The anti -rotavirus antibody  concentrations are determined by  a validated anti -rotavirus 
IgA ELISA. Micro titerplates (96- well) are coated with an anti -rotavirus monoclonal 
antibody . The wells are washed and incubated with (positive wells) or without (negative 
wells) RV. Following incubation, the plates are washed and serum, standard and control 
dilutions are incu bated in both ty pes of wells (positive and negative). Bound 
anti-rotavirus IgA in the well are detected b y incubation with peroxidase conjugated 
anti-human IgA pol yclonal antibodies. Color development proportional to the quantity  of 
bound anti -rotavirus IgA occurs in t he presence of a chromogen, TetraMethy lBenzidine 
(TMB) , and measured spectrophotometrically. Specific optical densities are calculated for 
each sample/control/standard dilution by measuring the difference between positive and 
negative wells, the use of negative wells allowing to assess non -specific IgA binding. The 
concentrations of the samples e xpressed in units per milliliter are calculated relative to 
the four -parameter logistic function generated from the standard curve.
Polio virus
Presen ce of antibodies against poliovirus ty pes 1, 2 and 3 will be determined by  a virus 
micro-neutralization test adapted from the World Health Organization Guidelines for 
WHO/EPI  Collaborative Studies on Poliomy elitis . The starting dilution at which serum 
samples will be tested is 1/8, from which a test wil l be considered positive. Titers will be 
expressed in terms of the reciprocal of the dilution resulting in 50% inhibition.

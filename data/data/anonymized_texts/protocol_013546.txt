Abstract  
Opioids are commonly prescribed after major gynecologic surgery, such as hysterectomy.  Whil e they 
may improve pain control for moderate to severe pain, this must be weighed against the existing and 
worsening opioid epidemic in the United States. Factors that affect a surgeon’s prescribing patterns may 
include experience, patient’s pre -existing p ain, and mode of surgery.  Furthermore, protocols may exist 
for the number of narcotics prescribed for the type of surgery performed.  Missing from the decision tree 
of prescribing narcotics is patient input.  The current study is a prospective randomized, clinical trial 
evaluating the impact of patient input on opioid prescribing and overall opioid use following gynecologic 
surgery.  
 
Research Plan  
I. Specific Aims  
 
Hypothesis:  In women who undergo minimally invasive hysterectomy, those who provide input in to the 
number of opioids prescribed are statistically significantly more likely to  have high  utiliz ation  of the 
narcotics prescribed.  
o Primary Outcome:  Patients randomized to patient directed arm will have a lower 
percentage of unused opioids as compared t o those prescribed standard therapy.  
o Secondary Outcome s:   
▪ Patients randomized to patient directed arm will use less narcotics overall as 
compared to those prescribed standard therapy.  
▪ Patients randomized to patient -directed arm will be more likely to be s atisfied 
with their post -operative pain management as compared to those prescribed 
standard therapy.  
 
II. Background and Significance  
Opioids are commonly prescribed after major gynecologic surgery, such as  a hysterectomy.  While they 
may improve pain con trol for moderate to severe pain, this must be weighed against the existing and 
worsening opioid epidemic in the United States.  There is a strong movement to minimize narcotics, by 
reviewing and optimizing the prescriptions prescribed, especially after su rgery.  As -Sanie et al evaluated 
common narcotic prescribing patterns following benign hysterectomy in Michigan and the authors found 
03-06-18JL  that typically 200 oral morphine equivalents are prescribed, while only about half of the medications 
were actually used. [1]  A recent survey study performed at a tertiary care center in Massachusetts 
evaluated opioids prescribing patterns and patient opioid consumption after gynecologic surgery found 
that patients used less than half  of prescribed opioids, and a fract ion did not use opioids at all. [2] 
 
Factors that affect a surgeon’s prescribing patterns may include physician experience, patient’s pre -
existing pain, and mode of surgery.  Furthermore, protocols may exist for the number  of narcotics 
prescribed for the type of surgery performed.  Missing from the decision tree of prescribi ng narcotics is 
patient input.  Shared -decision making has been shown to improve patient outcomes and patient 
satisfaction in several clinical settings. [3-5]  A Cochrane review of 105 randomized control trials 
documented that the use of patient decision aids for preference -sensitive decisions led to patients feeling 
more clear about what matters to them and having more accurate expectations of b enefits an d harms of 
options.[6 ]  
 
A prospective cohort study evaluating shared decision -making intervention on acute pain management 
after cesarean delivery showed a reduction in opioid utilization in 50% of their patient cohort and 
significant patient satisfaction  in regards to the ir outpatient pain management.[7 ]  Currently no studies 
have evaluated patient -directed input to narcotic prescriptions following surgery.  Including the patient 
into this decision tree may help optimize the narcotics prescribed and provi des some accountability to 
the patient since they helped make the decision.  
 
A national survey showed that most adolescents and adults reported recent non -medical use of opioid 
medications being obtained through family or friends .[8] By decreasing the numb er of opioids 
prescribed to patients, we could decrease the number of opioid medication sharing and potentially 
prevent unsafe opioid disposal practices.  
 
III. Research Design and Methods  
   
Study Design  
We propose a prospective randomized, clinical trial evaluating the impact on opioid prescribing and 
overall opioid use following gynecologic surgery.  Patients will be recruited if they are undergoing 
minimally invasive hysterectomy with the Department of Gynecology.  If they meet the inclusion criteria, 
patients will be randomized to standard treatment or patient -directed treatment.  They will be followed per 
standard postoperative care of the surgeon, and at the last postoperative visit, the remaining opioids will be 
collected and counted.   
 
Currently, th e Department of Gynecology’s standard approach to hysterectomy is in a minimally invasive 
modality  - vaginal, laparoscopic , or robotic.  These surgeries are typically performed as an outpatient 
surgery with same day discharge, unless other medical co -morbi dities exist or clinical status necessitates 
postoperative inpatient admission .  Patients undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy, with or without 
other gynecologic procedures, are discharged home with 150 oral morphine equivalents, or 30 tablets of 
oxycodone.  Patients also receive 40 tablets of ibuprofen 600 mg and 40 tablets of 500  mg acetaminophen. 
Patients  are informed that they can take ibuprofen 600 mg up to four times daily, acetaminophen 1000  mg 
up to four times daily  (or up to 4000 mg/day),  and oxycodone 5 -10 mg every 4 hours as needed for severe 
pain.   
 
Patient -directed opioid prescribing will take place after randomization for this arm of patients.  They will 
continue to receive prescriptions for ibuprofen and acetaminophen as standard therap y. There will be a 
discussion with the patient during the preoperative appointment as to the number of tablets (oxycodone 5  
mg) they wold like prescribed, from 0 to 30 tablets .  A standard verbal script discussing the pros and cons 
03-06-18JL  of opioid use will be ut ilized for this informed decision.  This will be documented in the preoperative 
clinic note and appropriate prescription will be provided to the patient on the day of surgery.  
 
Study Subjects  
Patients will be recruited from the Department of Gynecology.  T hey will be screened if they are 
undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy.  Those who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be 
approached for enrollment.  Once enrolled, the patient will undergo randomization to standard therapy 
or patient -directed therapy.  Prescription of opioids in the patient -directed therapy  arm will have an 
upper limit of 150 oral morphine equivalents, which is the standard therapy dose.  However, they will be 
free to choose a lower number of pills.   
 
Inclusion criteria  
• Female  patients >18 years old  
• Ability to provide informed consent  
• Planned minimally invasive hysterectomy with the Department of Surgery  
o Concomitant minimally invasive surgeries performed by Gynecology will be allowed  
Exclusion criteria  
• Non-English speaking  
• Comb ined surgical cases with other surgical departments  
• Planned laparotomy  
• Surgery planned to last >4 hours  
• Postoperative hospitalization planned for >7 days  
• Planned use of oral opioids other than oxycodone postoperatively  
• Pre-existing chronic pain conditions including: chronic pelvic pain, migraines, 
temporomandibular joint dysfunction syndrome, fibromyalgia, and interstitial cystitis  
• Preoperative diagnosis of pelvic pain  
• Chronic preoperative opioid use  
• History of or current diagnosis of narcotic or alcohol de pendence  
o Screening question asked at preoperative appointment:  Have you or are you currently 
dependent on narcotic medications or alcohol?  
• Desire for more opioids than standard therapy  
• Postoperative decision of surgeon to prescribed more than standard the rapy 
• Allergy or contraindication to taking opioids, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen  
 
Sample Size  
We will enroll patients until 216, assuming 20% patients either have missing data or dropout the study for 
any reason, which are 172 subjects. A smaple size of 86 in each group will achieve 90% power to detect 
the medium effect size of 0.5 by using two -sided two -sample t -test with 0.05 significance level.  
 
Subject Randomization  
The patients will be randomized into two groups, standard therapy  arm and patient -directe d arm. The 
block randomization method will be used to ensure balance in sample size between groups.  
 
Data Collection  
Demographic information will be collected, which will include age, race, BMI.  The surgical procedure 
performed will also be collected, alo ng with the length of hospitalization.  Type, strength and quantity of 
opioid s prescribed for all patients will be documented.  Refills on opioids that are required or other 
medications that are prescribed for pain will also be documented through chart rev iew.   
 
03-06-18JL  On the day of discharge from the hospital, patient will be provided with a pill diary by the study team. The 
patient will be instructed to document the  date and  time any pain medication  was t aken;  the number of 
oxycodone, ibuprofen, and/or acetamin ophen pills consumed during that time;  and their pain level prior to 
taking the oxycodone. Pain will be measured using an 11 -point numeric scal e ranging from 0 to 10. Zero  
will represent one pain extreme (i.e., “no pain”) and 10 will represent the other pa in extreme (i.e., “pain as 
bad as you can imagine” or “worst pain imaginable”).  Patient will be asked to complete the pill diary as 
long as they are taking pain medication post -operatively.  
 
At their 6-week postoperative visit , patients will be asked to br ing in their  pill diary and remaining pain 
medications  so that any excess pills can be counted and documented.  If the patient has more than one 
postoperative visit, they will be encouraged to bring their pill bottle at the 6-week postoperative visit. At 
their 6 -week post -operative visit, patients will be asked how satisfied they are with the number of narcotic 
pills they were initially prescribed, and they will rat e their satisfaction using a 5 -point numeric scale 
ranging from 1 to 5 . One will represent on e satisfaction extreme (i.e. “not at all satisfied”) , 3 will be 
neutral (i.e., “neither dissatisfied nor satisfied), and 5  will represent the other satisfaction extreme (“i.e., 
extremely satisfied”).  Those patients who forget or are unable to bring their m edication with them to the 6 -
week postoperative visit will be asked to count their own remaining medication and report this on a follow 
up phone call with the study team.  The patient satisfaction questionnaire may also be administered during 
this follow up  phone call if the patient was not able to complete this at the postoperative visit.  
 
Statistical Analysis  
Descriptive analysis will be performed to summarize demographic and clinical characteristics of the 
patients. We will compare the percentage of utili zation of opioid between the two groups by two -sample t -
test. We will do further analysis using Analysis of Variance and Covariance (ANCOVA) to compare the 
utilization between the two groups after adjusting patient characteristics if needed.  
 
 
IV. Human Su bjects  
Human subjects will be utilized for this protocol. As with all research, there is a chance that 
confidentiality could be compromised; however, precautions will be taken to minimize this risk. Patient 
identification codes will be used. A number will be assigned to all subjects and any report published will 
not identify the subjects by name. Data will be stored on password -protected computers.

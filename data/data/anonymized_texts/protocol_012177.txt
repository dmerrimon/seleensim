BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE 
 The number of women Veterans receiving care in the VA is increasing. It is important for VA to 
offer treatments for sleep problems that are effective and preferred by women Veterans.    
 The purpose of this study is to test two different insomnia treatment programs.    
 You are being asked to participate in this study because you previously completed and returned 
the postal survey “How are Women Veteran’s Sleeping?” and your answers indicated that you 
have symptoms of insomnia. 
 A total of 400  w omen Veterans who returned the survey will be enrolled into this study. 
 This study is funded by the VA and the principal investigator is Jennifer Martin, PhD of the VA 
Grea
ter Los Angeles Healthcare System.  
 
DURATION OF THE RESEARCH   
This research study will be conducted for approximately four years. Your individual participation in the 
projec
t will take approximately 3 months.     
 
STUDY PROCEDURES 
If you decide to take part in this study, this is what will happen after you sign this consent form:   
 
Health and Sleep Evaluation 
1. You will be asked questions about your health , med ications and personal information, such as 
your marital status, number of children, and employment . This will take about 30 minutes.

 2. You will be screened for sleep apnea with a monitoring device that you will wear for one night.   
This device is worn on your wrist and has four sensors: a 2 ½” plastic sensor worn on the index 
finger, a bandage-sized sensor worn on the ring finger, a nickel-sized sensor worn on the neck to 
detect snoring and a 2” sensor worn on the chest to detect body position.  These sensors are 
painless and have a sticky pad on the side that is placed next to your skin. You will need to return 
the monitoring device to the Sleep Research office the next day. 
 
3. When you return the sleep apnea monitor, you will be asked another set of questions about your 
mood, memory, stress, and quality of life.  This will take about 90 minutes.  
 
4. You will be asked to wear a sleep watch for 8 consecutive days. The sleep watch looks like a wrist 
watch and will measure when you are asleep and when you are awake.  
 
5. You will fill-out a diary about your sleep each day that you wear the sleep watch. This will take 
about 1-2 minutes per day. You will return the sleep diary with the sleep watch. 
 
6. When you return the sleep watch after 8 days, you will be asked questions about your sleep 
patterns and habits . It will take about 30  minutes to answer these questions.   
 
Medical Record Review 
If you volunteer to participate in this study, you are also agreeing to let the research staff review your 
VA medical records to obtain information about your: 
 use of VA services (including insomnia treatments) over the past year 
 diagnoses and treatment (including diagnoses and treatment related to mental health 
co
nditions and drug and alcohol abuse)  
 current medications  
 
A
fter all of this information has been collected, it will be reviewed by the study doctors to determine if 
you meet the criteria for receiving the insomnia treatment program.  If we find that you suffer from a 
condition that would make it difficult for you to participate in this study, you will be excluded from the 
study.  We will inform you, and with your permission, your doctor of these findings. 
 
Insomnia Treatment Program 
If you are eligible to continue with the study, you will receive one of two insomnia treatment programs, 
Program A or Program B.  Which treatment program you will receive will be determined randomly 
(like flipping a coin). You will attend 5 weekly sessions, each lasting 60 minutes, at the VA Sepulveda

 Ambulatory Care Center.  The content of each session will vary, but each one will focus on providing 
education and strategies to improve sleep and decrease concerns related to sleep.  Neither program 
will include the use of sleeping medications. If you are currently using a sleeping medication, you will 
continue to follow your doctor’s recommendations. The sessions will be led by Sleep Research staff 
who have been trained to teach this type of program.  At the end of the program, we will ask you to 
complete questionnaires about your experience with the treatment program. 
 
The treatment sessions you attend will be recorded for the purpose of making sure that study staff 
follow the protocol for each session. The recording will not be shared with anyone outside project 
staff.  
 
Follow-up Evaluations 
You will receive a follow- up evaluation at the end of the 6-week insomnia treatment program and 
again after 3-months. At each of these evaluations, you will be asked to repeat the questionnaires 
about your sleep, mood, stress, and quality of life . You will also be asked to wear the sleep watch for 
8 days and to complete a sleep diary.  Research staff will again review your medical records to see if 
there have been any changes in your health or medications.  
 
All activities are being undertaken for research purposes only. 
 
POSSIBLE RISKS OR DISCOMFORTS 
You may experience the following risks and discomforts as a result of participating in this study: 
Sleep monitoring: The known risks associated with wearing the sleep monitoring device are minimal. 
The sleep apnea sensors worn for one night and the sleep watch worn for 9 days may be annoying or 
uncomfortable for you.  Rarely, they may cause skin irritation or an allergy.  To minimize skin 
irritation, we provide wrist bands that are flexible and adjustable and we have limited the sleep apnea 
recording to only one night .  
 
Questionnaires: You may feel uncomfortable answering questions about your health, mood, 
relationships or sleep habits. You can choose to skip any questions that make you feel 
uncomfortable.  
 
Insomnia treatment program:   You may find that coming to the 5 session insomnia treatment program 
is tiring or inconvenient.   As you make adjustments to your sleep habits within the program, you may 
experience more daytime sleepiness at first.  It will be important that you follow the instructions given 
by your program instructor if this occurs.   
 
It is possible that there are other unforeseeable risks.

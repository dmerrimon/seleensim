Study design  
PROfound  is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open -label, phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy 
and safety of olaparib versus enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate in subjects with metastatic castration -
resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have failed prior tr eatment with a new hormonal agent (NHA) 
and have a qualifying tumor mutation in one of 15 genes involved in the homologous recombination 
repair (HRR) pathway. Subjects will be divided into two cohorts based on HRR gene mutation status.

Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 Mar ch 2019  
  8 (170) Subjects with mutati ons in either BRCA1 , BRCA2 , or ATM  will be in Cohort A whereas subjects with 
mutations among 12 other genes involved in the HRR pathway ( BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, 
CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, PPP2R2A, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D,  or RAD54L ) will be in Cohort B. 
The p rimary endpoint of the study is radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) in subjects with 
BRCA1 , BRCA2  or ATM  mutations (Cohort A). Given the open label design of the study, rigorous 
methodology will be employed to ensure robustness of the primary end point assessment with a 
primary analysis of rPFS based on blinded independent central review (BICR) of all subject scans.  Key 
secondary endpoints include confirmed objective response rate (Cohort A), rPFS (combined Cohorts A 
+ B), time to pain progression (Cohort A), and overall survival (Cohort A).  
Approximately 340 subjects will be randomized 2:1 (olaparib : investigator choice of enzalutamide or 
abiraterone acetate) into the trial, with ~240 subjects in Cohort A and approximately 100 subjects in 
Cohort B.  
 
The treatment groups include olaparib tablets (300 mg bid) or investigator choice 
of either enzalutamide capsules /tablets  (160 mg od) or abiraterone acetate tablets (1,000 mg od with 5 
mg bid  prednisone). The investigator must declare prior to randomization their choice of either 
enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate.  
 
The randomization scheme will be stratified based on:  
• Prior taxane (yes vs no)  
• Measurable disease (yes vs no)  
Randomized study treatment will be given until objective radiographic progression as assessed by 
BICR. Upon BICR progression, sub jects randomized to the investigator choice arm will be given the 
option to switch to olaparib.  
Objectives  
Primary Objective:  Outcome Measure:  
To determine the efficacy (as assessed by 
rPFS) of olaparib versus investigator choice of 
enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate in subjects 
with mCRPC with BRCA1 , BRCA2  or ATM  
qualifying mutations (Cohort A)  • rPFS by BICR using RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue)

Target subject population  
All subjects in the study will be selected based on the following 2 criteria:  
Biomarker selection:  Documented tumor (tissue) qualifying mutation(s) in one of 15 HRR genes that 
is predicted to be deleterious or suspected deleterious. All subjects must provide a formalin fixed and 
paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor sample for tissue -based HRR gene panel muta tion testing using the 
clinical trial assay (CTA) known as the Lynparza HRR Assay. Foundation Medicine, Inc. (FMI) will 
provide the CTA, a novel next generation sequencing (NGS) -based assay using DNA extracted from 
Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) t issue. Tumor tissue samples can be from either primary 
tumor (e.g. , transrectal biopsies or radical prostatectomy specimen) or metastatic biopsy. The tumor 
sample will be tested for mutation in 15 pre -specified HRR genes . If the test results indicate that the 
subject has a qualifying mutation in the BRCA1, BRCA2 , or ATM  genes, the subject is eligible for 
Cohort A of the study. If the results indicate that the subject has a qualifying mutation in any of the 

Clinical Study Protocol Synopsis

Version 4.0  
Date 07 Mar ch 2019  
  13 (170) remaining 12 genes ( BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHE K2, FANCL, PALB2, PPP2R2A, 
RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, and RAD54L ), then the subject is eligible for Cohort B.  
 
Treatment setting: All subjects must have mCRPC and have received and failed prior treatment with 
an NHA (e.g. , abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide). Prior receipt of other anti -prostate cancer 
therapies, including docetaxel, cabazitaxel, radium -223, and sipuleucel -T is permitted but not 
required.   Subjects must not have received previou s treatment with a DNA -damaging cytotoxic 
chemotherapy (e.g. , prior platinum -based chemotherapy and mitoxantrone are not permitted) or a 
PARP inhibitor, including olaparib.  
Duration of treatment  
Until the primary rPFS analysis, all subjects should continue  to receive randomized study treatment 
until radiographic progression as assessed by BICR, or until the subject is unable to tolerate study 
treatment. After the date of data cut -off (DCO ) for the primary analysis, subjects should receive 
treatment until radiographic  progression as assessed by the investigator , or until the subject is unable to 
tolerate study treatment .  
 Bone p rogression requires confirmation by 
a second bone scan at least 6 weeks later.  Radiologic assessments will include both bone scans and 
CT/MRI and will be scheduled ev ery 8 weeks (±7 days). All imaging assessments (including 
unscheduled visit scans) will be  sent to AstraZeneca appointed central reader on an ongoing basis and 
analysis by BICR will be triggered upon inve stigator -assessed progression. Results of BICR will be 
immediately reported back to sites. Since the primary analysis of the study is based on  BICR, it is 
important that study treatment and scheduled imaging assessments conti nue until progression by 
BICR. For this same reason, PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) rise, without evidence of radiographic 
progression, is strongly discouraged as a criteri on to stop treatment or to start a new systemic anti -
prostate cancer therapy.  
Upon documentation of radiographic progression by BICR  before the primary rPFS analysis, or after 
the primary rPFS analysis based on investigator -assessed radiographic progression , receipt of 
subsequent anti -cancer therapies is allowed at the investigator’s discretion and will be recorded. 
Furthermore, upon B ICR-assessed progression, subjects randomized to investigator choice arm will be 
given the option to receive olaparib.  
No restrictions are made to prior or concurrent receipt of bone metastases targeting therapies with 
zoledronic acid or denosumab.  
Investi gational product, dosage and mode of administration  
Subjects will receive either olaparib, enzalutamide, or abiraterone acetate.  
Olaparib:  Olaparib is available as a film -coated tablet containing 150 mg or 100 mg of olaparib. 
Subjects will be administered study treatment orally at a dose of 300 mg twice daily (bid). The planned 
dose of 300 mg bid will be made up of two x 150 mg tablets twice daily, with 100 mg tablets used to 
manage dose reductions.

  14 (170) Subjects should take doses at a similar time each day, wit h the twice daily doses taken approximately 
12 hours apart. All doses should be taken with a glass of water. The olaparib tablets should be 
swallowed whole and not chewed, crushed, dissolved or divided. Study tablets can be taken with or 
without food. On t he PK sampling day subjects should fast from 1 hour before taking the olaparib dose 
to two hours after.  
Enzalutamide:  Enzalutamide is available as capsules /tablets  containing 40 mg of enzalutamide. 
Subjects will be administered study treatment orally at a dose of 160 mg once daily. Subjects should 
take enzalutamide doses at a similar time each day. Capsules /tablets  should be swallowed whole and 
can be taken with or without food, in full accordance with local prescribing information.  
Abiraterone acetate with prednisone:  Abiraterone acetate is available as tablets containing 250 mg 
or 500 mg of abiraterone acetate. Subjects will be administered study treatment orally at a dose of 
1,000 mg once daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg administered twice daily orally. Subject 
should take abiraterone acetate doses at a similar time each day. Abiraterone acetate must be taken on 
an empty stomach. No food should be consumed for at least two hours before the dose of abiraterone 
acetate and one hour after  the dose of abiraterone acetate. The tablets should be swallowed whole with 
water and not crushed or chewed, in full accordance with local prescribing information.  
Statistical methods  
The primary analysis of rPFS primary endpoint will be performed after a pproximately 143 progression 
or death events have been accrued in 240 subjects in Cohort A (60% maturity) and would provide 95% 
power to show a statistically significant difference in rPFS at 2 -sided 5% alpha level if the assumed 
true treatment effect was a HR=0.53 (corresponding to an assumed increase in median rPFS from 5 
months (enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate) to 9.5 months (olaparib).  
 
 
 
It is anticipated that the study accrual period will be approximately 28 months and that 143 progression 
and death events will occur approximately 35 months after the first subj ect is randomized in the study. 
rPFS will be analyzed using a log rank test stratified by previous taxane (yes, no) and measurable 
disease (yes, no) and the corresponding p value will be generated. The hazard ratio together with its 
corresponding 95% confi dence interval will be estimated using a Cox Proportional Hazards Model.  
If the primary analysis of rPFS in Cohort A demonstrates statistical significance, testing of key 
secondary endpoints ORR (Cohort A), rPFS (Cohort A+B), time to pain progression (Coho rt A) and 
OS (Cohort A) will be performed in a hierarchical manner using the alpha level recycled from the 
primary endpoint.  
Safety  analyses will be presented  using  the Safety  Analysis Set and will be done  by means of 
descri ptive statistics in Cohorts A, B and A+B.  Safety profiles will be assessed in terms of AEs, vital  
signs (including BP and  pulse  rate),  ECG, laboratory  data (clinical chemistry and hematology),  and 
physical exa mination.  
Analyses on Cohorts B and A+B will be performed at the time of primary rPFS analysis in Cohort A.

  15 (170) Pharmacokinetic analysis  
The plasma concentration -time data will be analyzed by non -linear mixed effects modelling in order to 
evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of olaparib, quantify variability in the pharmacokinetics, 
identify demographic or  pathophysiological covariates which may explain the observed variability and 
explore exposure -response relationships.

1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study  
1.1.1 Advanced prostate cancer and its treatment  
Prostate cancer has been associated with over -diagnosis and over -treatment in early stages ( Shen and 
Kumar 2015 ), where cure rates are high and average long -term clinical outcomes favorable. However, 
it is a heterogeneous disease and no cure exists for those patients reaching the metastatic castration -
resistant (mCRPC) stage of the disease. With an estimated in cidence of 233,000 new cases and 29,480 
deaths in 2014, it is the most frequently diagnosed non -skin cancer and second most frequent cause of 
cancer deaths in US males ( American Cancer Society 2014 ). Similar prostate cancer mortality rates are 
reported for Western Europe ( Center et al 2012 ). Almost all patients dying from prostate cancer will 
have mCRPC, and 90% of overall mortality in mCRPC patients is attributable to the underlying 
malignant disease ( Scher et al 2015 ). 
While a variety of life prolonging agents are approved for mCRPC, a median overall survival of about 
3 years obtained with early treatment initiation such as abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide ( Ryan et 
al 2013  and Beer et al 2014 ) still constitutes a grossly reduced life expectancy when compared to the 
about 15 years of life expectancy for age -matched men (~ 70 years) from the general population ( US 
Social Security ). Hence a high unmet medical need remains for men with mCRPC for efficacious and 
well tolerated therapies.  
A small percentage of prostate tumors have loss of function mu tations in candidate genes involved in 
homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DNA. BRCA1, BRCA2 , or ATM  are the most well -
characterized and/or frequently mutated HRR genes in prostate cancer and hence form the basis for 
selecting a biomarker -defined targ et mCRPC population in this phase 3 registration study. The overall 
mutation frequency for these three genes is expected to be less than 15% ( Kumar et al 2016 , Mateo et 
al 2015  and Robinson et al 2015 ); furthermore, assuming a technical failure rate of 25% to determine 
BRCA1, BRCA2 , or ATM  mutations in tumor tissue obtained either by fresh biopsy or using archival 
tissue, only about 1 out of 10 patients with mCRPC will qualify for Cohort A of the proposed 
registration trial. It appears that about half of HRR gene mutations detectable in tum or tissue constitute 
germline mutations (the other half being somatic in nature, i.e., exclusively occurring in tumor tissue; 
Mateo et al 2015 ). While an adverse prognostic impact of germline BRCA2  mutations has been 
described ( Castro et al 2015 ), it is less clear if other germline or somatic HRR gene mutations are 
associated with similar adverse clinical outcomes. For patients with mCRPC there are no readily 
available clinical parameters known (e.g., age and Gleason score a t initial diagnosis, metastatic

  28 (170) patterns) to phenotypically differentiate those patients with underlying tumor HRR gene mutations 
from those without HRR gene mutations ( Mateo et al 2015 ).  
However, mCRPC patients with HRR gene mutations have a high propensity to benefit from anti -
cancer therapies resulting in an increased number of DNA double -strand breaks, such as  the PARP 
inhibitor olaparib ( Mateo et al 2015  and Kaufman et al 2015 ), and potentially platin compounds 
(Cheng et al 2015 ). Notably, in the phase II single arm study reported by Mateo et al. high response 
rates, including confirmed RECIST responses of > 50%, were observed with olaparib treatment in 
biomarker -positive patients (tissue HRR mutations) despite these patients having failed both 
abiraterone acetate and/or enzalutamide as well as docetaxel and the majority of them also having 
received cabazitaxel. Conversely, almost no responses were seen in biomarker -negative patients. A 
striking difference in biological activity of olaparib was also seen between biomarker -positive vs. –
negative patients on other clinical outcomes such as radiologic progression free survival and overall 
survival ( Mateo et al 2015 ). This phase 2 study is described in more detail in Section 1.1.6.1 . An 
independent phase 2 clinical study reported by Kaufman et al 2015  included mCRPC patients with 
germline BRCA1  or BRCA2  mutations and found a similar rate (50%) of confirmed RECIST responses 
followi ng treatment with olaparib.  
There are no approved targeted treatments for mCRPC patients with tissue mutations of BRCA1 , 
BRCA2 , ATM  or other HRR genes and their treatment is not different from non -selected mCRPC 
patients.  
1.1.1.1  Standard -of-care therapy in mCRPC failing abiraterone or enzal utamide  
New hormonal agents (NHA) such as abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide are potent, orally available 
treatment options with a favorable tolerability profile and have replaced docetaxel as preferred choice 
of first -line therapy for mCRPC ( Flaig et al 2016 ). Both of these agents have demonstrated robust 
improvements on PFS and OS and have also shown a significantly prolonged time to initiation of 
cytotoxic chemotherapy ( Ryan et al 2013  and Beer et al 2014 ). However, once mCRPC patients have 
failed NHA, the benefit from approved therapeutic options appears substantially diminished and no 
clear single standard of care exists as none of the currently approved agents have been devel oped for a 
post-NHA setting:  
Taxanes:  Unless symptomatic or with high tumor burden, few patients are expected to immediately 
receive docetaxel. For example, 48% of mCRPC patients never received docetaxel at a major U.S. 
academic center ( Steinberger et al 2015 ). 
Efficacy of docetaxel appears markedly reduced when given after NHA as compared to first line use 
(Mezynski et al 2012 , Schweizer et al 2014 ), likely attributable to at least partial cross -resistance 
between taxanes and NHA ( van Soest et al 2013 ). 
The efficacy of docetaxel after failure of abiraterone acetate does not appear to be superior to that of 
enzalutamide ( Sun and Chen 2010  and Suzman et al 2014 ). 
Cabazitaxel appears to have a low real -world usage ( Flaig et al 2016 ) and is approved only after failure 
of docetaxel.  
Both docetaxel and cabazitaxel are administered per i.v. infusion and have boxed warnings for 
hypersensitivity reactions as well as neutropenia/neutropenic deaths.

  29 (170) NHA:  Due to at least partial cross -resistance, switching from one NHA to the other is assoc iated with 
reduced efficacy ( Cheng et al 2015 ), with rPFS outcomes similar to those observed with docetaxel in a 
post-NHA setting (Sun and Chen 2010  and Suzman et al 2014 ). 
Other agents:  Sipuleucel -T and radium -223 are rarely used additional therapeutic options; their use is 
either limited regionally (sipuleucel -T: U.S.) and/or restricted to certain patient populations such as 
those with asymptomatic/minimally symptomatic disease (sipuleucel -T) or those with bone -only 
disease and symptoms (radium -223). Efficacy of these agents in a post -NHA setting is unknown.  
In addition to limited efficacy, tolerability issues such as fatigue ( Moreira et al 2016 ) and hematologic 
toxicity from taxanes may further limit use of available options and contribute to short real -world 
estimated median treatment durations between 10 weeks (taxane) and 14 to 17 weeks (NHA) in a 
second line setting ( Flaig et al 2016 ). The median overall survival of patients who have failed NHA 
but have not previously received ta xane chemotherapy appears to be between 8.6 months and 12.5 
months ( Azad et al 2015  and Mezynski et al 2012 ) reflecting a high unmet medical need for mCRPC 
patients who fail NHA.  
1.1.1.2  Standard -of-care therapy in mCRPC who have failed abiraterone acetate 
and/or enzalutamide and docetaxel (+/-cabazitaxel)  
Limited data are available for patients who failed both NHA and at least one taxane -based 
chemotherapy. As expected, in general, responses to treatments decrease with more lines of prior 
therapies, while differences in prognostic baseline factors still confer heterogeneity in clinical response 
measured by rPFS and OS ( Caffo et al 2015 ). Additional data by ( Mateo et al 2015  and Azad et al 
2015 ) indicate a median overall survival of up to 10 months for these very advanced patients, 
reflecting a high unmet medical need for mCRPC patients who have failed prior NHA(s) and prior 
taxane( s). 
1.1.2 Research hypothesis  
Single agent olaparib at 300 mg bid has superior efficacy and an acceptable tolerability profile as 
compared with enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate in mCRPC patients with deleterious or suspected 
deleterious HRR gene mutations and  who have previously failed treatment with an NHA such as 
enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate. The efficacy in this study will be assessed by the primary analysis 
of rPFS defined as the time from randomization until the date of objective radiological disea se 
progression or death.  Radiological assessments (RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue and PCWG3 for bone) will 
be based upon blinded, independent central review (BICR).  
1.1.3 PARP inhibition as a target for  HRR mutation positive mCRPC  
Investigators should be familiar wi th the current olaparib (AZD2281) Investigator Brochure (IB).  
Olaparib (AZD2281, KU -0059436) is a potent Polyadenosine 5’diphosphoribose [poly (ADP -ribose)] 
polymerization (PARP) inhibitor (PARP -1, -2 and -3) that is being developed as an oral therapy, bot h 
as a monotherapy (including maintenance) and for combination with chemotherapy and other anti -
cancer agents.  
PARP inhibition is a novel approach to targeting tumors with deficiencies in DNA repair mechanisms.  
PARP enzymes are essential for repairing D NA single strand breaks (SSBs).  Inhibiting PARPs leads to 
the persistence of SSBs, which are then converted to DNA double -strand breaks (DSBs) during the 
Clinical Study Protocol

  30 (170) process of DNA replication. During the process of cell division, DSBs can be efficiently repaired in 
normal cells by homologous recomb ination repair (HRR). Tumors with homologous recombination 
deficiencies (HRD), such as mCRPC in patients with BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM or other HRR gene 
mutations, cannot accurately repair the DNA damage, which may bec ome leth al to cells as it 
accumulates. In such tumor types, olaparib may offer a potentially efficacious and less toxic cancer 
treatment compared with currently available taxane -based chemotherapy regimens.  
HRR defective tumors are intrinsically sensitive  to PARP inhibitors, both in tumor models in vivo 
(Rottenberg et al 2008 , Hay et al 2009 ) and in the clinic ( Fong et al 2009 , Tutt et al 2010 , Mateo et al 
2015 , and Kaufman et al 2015 ). The main mechanism of action for olaparib results from the trapping 
of inactive PARP onto the single -strand breaks preventing their repair ( Helleday 2011  and Murai et al 
2012 ). Persistence of SSBs during DNA replication results in their conversion into the more serious 
DNA DSBs that would normally be repair ed by homologous repair. Olaparib has been shown to inhibit 
selected tumor cell lines in vitro and in xenograft and primary explant models as well as in genetic 
BRCA knockout models, either as a stand -alone treatment or in combination with established 
chem otherapies.  
1.1.4 Pre-clinical experience  
The pre -clinical experience is fully described in the current version of the olaparib IB.   
1.1.5 Toxicology and safety pharmacology summary  
Olaparib has been tested in a standard range of safety pharmacology studies e.g. , dog cardiovascular 
and respiratory function tests, and the rat Irwin test. There were no noticeable effects on the 
cardiovascular or respiratory parameters in the anesthetized dog or any behavioral, autonomic or motor 
effects in the rat at the doses studied.  
Rodent and dog toxicology studies have indicated that the primary target organ of toxicity is the bone 
marrow with recovery seen following the withdrawal of olaparib. Ex vivo studies have confirmed that 
olaparib is cytotoxic to human bone marrow cells.  
Olaparib was not mutagenic in the Ames test but was clastogenic in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 
chromosome aberration test in vitro. When dosed orally, olaparib also induced micronuclei in the bone 
marrow of rats. This profile is consistent with the pot ential for genotoxicity in man.  
Reproductive toxicology data indicate that olaparib can have adverse effects on embryofoetal survival 
and development at dose levels that do not induce significant maternal toxicity.  
AstraZeneca considers that the advanced prostate cancer patient population involved in this study falls 
under the advanced cancer, limited life expectancy definition outlined in ICH S9 guideline "Non -
clinical Evaluation For Anticancer Pharmaceuticals" and meets the requirements outlined  in the 
guideline. Further information can be found in the current version of the olaparib IB

  31 (170) 1.1.6.1  Preliminary Report of Olaparib Activity in Pro state Cancer ( Sandhu et al 
2013 ) 
The first report of olaparib monotherapy activity in advanced prostate cancer came from 3 patients 
with advanced prost ate cancer and germline BRCA2 mutations who were treated in Phase I studies. 
Each patient was castration -resistant before the start of olaparib therapy and 1 of them also received 
previous docetaxel and abiraterone acetate. Duration of olaparib treatment ( 300 mg bid tablet) ranged 
from 11 to 34 months for the 3 patients. The post -NHA post -taxane patient experienced a RECIST 
partial response and a PSA response (from 63 to 3.8 μg/l) under olaparib and remained on treatment 
for > 26 months.  
1.1.6.2  TOPARP A ( Mateo et al 2015 ) 
TOPARP A was a multicenter phase 2 investigator -initiated single arm study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in 
mCRPC patients conducted in the United Kingdom. Prior pre -treatment with docetaxel was required 
and almost all patients had at least one prior NHA, which rendered TOPARP A, a third line and above 
setting. Olaparib was administered daily at 400 mg bid tablets. The primary endpoint, composite 
response rate (RR), was defined as either objective response by RECIST 1.1 and/or PSA fall ≥50% 
and/or circulating tumor cell (CTC) count falls from ≥5 to <5/7.5 ml blood (Veridex™). For these 
components to each count as a primary endpoint event, confirmation  by a second measurement at least 
4 weeks later was required. The secondary endpoints for the study included safety, tolerability, 
progression -free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Exome, transcriptome, targeted next -
generation sequencing (NGS) a nd digital PCR tests were conducted from mandated biopsies (in 43 
patients, mCRPC biopsy material was suitable for NGS, in the remaining 6 patients archival tumor 
tissue obtained at initial diagnosis was analyzed). Overall, 50 patients were enrolled; prior  treatments 
included docetaxel (100%), cabazitaxel (58%), abiraterone acetate (96%), enzalutamide (28%), and 
palliative radiotherapy (26%).  
Efficacy (overall population)  
In the full population of evaluable patients (n = 49; one patient was lost to follow -up after 1 week and 
deemed non -evaluable by DMC, 16 (32.7%) responded to olaparib (95% CI: 20.0 -47.5) by the 
composite response definition with 12 patients on treatment for >6 months.  Six of 32 RECIST 1.1 
measurable patients had radiological responses (18. 8 %), and 11 patients had a biochemical response 
defined as a ≥50% decrease in PSA levels. Four of these responses lasted more than 1 year.  
Efficacy by biomarker status  
NGS identified homozygous deletions and/or deleterious mutations in DNA repair genes i n 16/49 
(32.7%) cases, including eight (8) patients with BRCA1, BRCA2 and 5 with  ATM alterations.  Of the 
sixteen patients with DNA repair mutations, 14 (87.5%) responded to olaparib by the composite 
response definition including all 7/7 patients with BRCA 2 loss (4 bi -allelic somatic loss; 3 germline 
mutations) and 4/5 patients with ATM  aberrations.  Few responses were observed in biomarker -
negative patients (no DNA repair mutations; 2/33 = 6% RR). Table 1 illustrates composite response 
rates by biomarker status.

Median rPFS of the 16 marker positive patients was 9.8 months with a median OS of 13.8 months, as 
opposed to a markedly lower median rPFS of 2.7 months with a median OS of 7.5 months in patients 
without DNA repair gene mutations ( Mateo et al 2015 ).  
Time on treatment ranged from 24 to 48 weeks (mean = 39 and median = 40 weeks) among the 7 
patients with  BRCA2  mutations and from 11 to 73 weeks (mean = 43 and median = 57 weeks) among 
the 5 pat ients with  ATM  mutations. There were 3 patients still being treated with olaparib among the 
BRCA2  subgroup at data cut -off.  
Safety:  
The most frequently observed AEs (all grades; irrespective of causality) were anemia (76%), fatigue 
(58%), nausea (36%) and arthralgia (30%).  The most common grade >3 adverse events were anemia 
(20%) and fatigue (12%), with 26% of patients requiring a dos e reduction.   
1.2 Rationale for study design, doses and control groups  
Based on data from the TOPARP A study ( Mateo et al 2015 ) a decision was made to require the 
presence of a qualifying tissue HRR gene mutation as an inclusion criterion for patients with mCRPC 
who have failed prior therapy with an NHA. The molecular analysis will be performed by a designated 
central dia gnostic provider (Foundation Medicine, Inc.) using an NGS assay, the investigational 
Lynparza HRR Assay. The rationale for only using BRCA1, BRCA2  and ATM  tissue mutations for the 
primary endpoint (Cohort A) is based upon the prevalence of these mutations and/or how well 
mutations in these genes are characterized to date. It is expected that qualifying mutations will be 
detectable in the tissue of about one out of 10 mCRPC patients.  
While the TOPARP A trial was limited to patients who had failed both NHA a nd a taxane, this study 
will also enroll patient not yet having received taxane chemotherapy for mCRPC as there is a medical 
need for patients failing NHA both pre - and post -taxane (see Section 1.1.1.1  and Section 1.1.1.2 ) and 
as the biological activity of olaparib is expected to be i ndependent of prior taxane therapy.  
The randomization will be 2:1 (olaparib vs. enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate). Enzalutamide and 
abiraterone acetate were chosen as comparators for the following reasons:  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib

Version 4.0

  33 (170) • Enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate are broad ly approved for the treatment of mCRPC. 
Switch to the alternate NHA mirrors a relevant real -world scenario for a situation in which 
no single standard of care exists ( Vogelzang et al 2016 ). 
• Similar efficacy compared to docetaxel in post -NHA setting  (Sun and Chen 2010  and 
Suzman et al 2014 ), but oral availability and superior tolerability compared to taxanes make 
them the preferred treatment of choice.  
• Documented effectiveness both pre and post docetaxel ( de Bono et al 2011 , Ryan et al 2013 , 
Scher et al 2012  and Beer et al 2014 ). 
Due to the open -label design of the study, rigorous methodology will be employed to ensure 
robustness of the primary endpoint assessment with the primary analysis of rPFS based on blinded 
independent centr al review (BICR) of all scans. Also, acknowledging the bone predominance of 
mCRPC and the particular challenges of determining bone progression in patients with high skeletal 
tumor burden (Kluetz et al 2013 ), progression in bone will require confirmation by a repeat scan at 
least 6 weeks later as outlined in detail by PCWG3 criteria ( Scher et al 2016 ).  
The dose used in TOPARP A (400 mg tablets bid) was chosen at a time when information on the 
relative clinical activity with the tablet formulation was not  fully complete; as a 300 mg bid tablet dose 
is now considered maximally effective and used across the ongoing olaparib development program, 
this dose has been chosen for this study.  
1.2.1 Rationale for developing the Lynparza Homologous Recombination Repair 
(HRR) Assay  
AstraZeneca has partnered with Foundation Medicine, Inc.  (FMI) to develop a novel tumor tissue -
based companion diagnostic – the Lynparza HRR Assay – for the detection of mutations in a panel of 
15 HRR genes. The 15 genes that comprise the Lynparza HRR Assay are a subset of the genes covered 
in the FoundationOne® comprehensive cancer panel: a clinical -grade cancer gene profiling test which 
analyzes the coding sequence of 310 cancer -related genes plus introns from select genes for variants 
and/or rearrangements.  
For each patient that passes tissue sample and seque ncing quality control, FMI will generate a report 
specifying presence or absence of qualifying HRR gene mutations. A patient has a qualifying mutation 
if any deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation is found in the HRR genes. A mutation is regarded 
as deleterious if it results in protein truncation (which includes nonsense, frameshift, or consensus 
splice site mutations), or select missense mutations well -known to be deleterious in ClinVar/BIC 
databases. Furthermore, larger scale alterations such as ge nomic truncating rearrangements or 
homozygous deletions will also be classified as qualifying. Patients without qualifying HRR gene 
mutations as determined by the Lynparza HRR Assay will not be eligible for the study.  
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment  
As the proposed study will be limited to biomarker -positive patients (i.e., those with qualifying 
mutations in BRCA1 , BRCA2 , or ATM  [Cohort A] or other HRR genes [Cohort B]) for which strong 
clinical activity can be expected ( Mateo et al 2015  and Kaufman et al 2015 ) and as olaparib has been

  34 (170) found to be  well tolerated across various cancer entities, a positive benefit/risk profile is expected and 
no ethical issues are identified from exposing patients to olaparib within the planned registration trial.  
More detailed information about the known and expecte d benefits and risks  of olaparib may be found 
in the current version of the olaparib IB.  
See Section 6.10.2  for information regarding the Data Monitoring Committee.  
1.4 Study Design  
This is a prospective, multicenter, open -label, randomized phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and 
safety of olaparib (300 mg orally bid) versus investigator choice of either enzalutamide (160 mg orally 
od) or abiraterone acetate (1,000 mg orally od with 5 mg bid prednisone) in approximately 340 
subjects with mCRPC with qualifying HRR gene mutations who have failed prior treatment with an 
NHA.  
 Prior to randomization, approximately 5500  subjects will be centrally screened for 
eligibility based on tumor tissue testing u sing the Lynparza HRR assay (FMI, Cambridge MA). 
Subjects with BRCA1, BRCA2 or ATM  qualifying gene mutations will be included in Cohort A 
whereas subjects with mutations among 12 other genes involved in HRR ( BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, 
CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, PPP2R2A, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, and RAD54L ) will be 
included in Cohort B. Subjec ts will be randomized 2:1 to either olaparib or predeclared investigator 
choice of either enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate in each of the Cohorts A and B. Randomization 
will be stratified based on prior receipt of taxane chemotherapy (yes vs no) and pre sence of measurable 
disease at baseline (yes vs no).

blood cells and platelet transfusions are acceptable, for timing, refer to inclusion criteria 
no.10).  
For procedures for withdrawal of incorrectly enrolled subjec ts, see Section 3.4. 
3.3 Subject enrol lment and randomization  
Investigator(s) should keep a record, the subject screening log, of subjects who entered pre-study 
screening.  
The Investigator(s) will:  
1. Obtain signed informed consent from the potential subject before any study -specific 
procedures are performed.  
2. Assign p otential subject a unique enrol lment number (i.e., E -code) using the centralized 
Interactive Voice/Web Response System (IVRS/IWRS). The E -code is sequentially issued 
and will be used to identify the subject on all study -related documents including the 
electronic case report form (eCRF).  
3. Determine subject eligibility. See Sections 3.1 and 3.2.  
4. The investigator must declare their choice of either enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate 
using the IVRS/IWRS.  
5. Assign eligible s ubject unique randomiz ation code   
If the subject is found to be ineligible during screening, the subject must  be screen failed in the 
IVRS/IWRS. Specific directions concerning the use of the IVRS/IWRS will be provided in a separate 
instruction manual.  If a subject withdraws from participation in the study then his assigned codes 
cannot be reused.  
3.4 Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled or randomized 
Subjects  
Subjects who fail to meet the eligibility criteria should not, under any circumstances, be enrolled or 
receive study medication.  There can be no exceptions to this rule.  Subjects who are  enrolled, but 
subsequently found not to meet all the eligibility criteria must not be randomized or initiated on 
treatment, and must be withdrawn from the study.  
Where a subject does not meet all the eligibility criteria but is randomized in error, or inc orrectly 
started on treatment, the Investigator should inform the AstraZeneca study physician immediately, and 
a discussion should occur between the AstraZeneca study physician and the investigator regarding 
whether to continue or discontinue the subject f rom treatment. The AstraZeneca study physician must 
ensure all decisions are appropriately documented.

  47 (170) 3.5 Methods for assigning treatment groups  
Subjects in Cohort A and Cohort B will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to olaparib or investigator choice 
of enzaluta mide or abiraterone acetate.  
The randomization codes will be computer generated using a randomization system (AZRand) and 
loaded into the interactive voice response system/interactive web response system (IVRS/IWRS) 
database. A blocked randomization list will be generated to ensure an approximate balance between 
the olaparib and enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate arms in Cohorts A and B (2:1). The 
randomization will be stratified by previous taxane use (yes, no) and whether subject had measurable 
disease (yes, no).  
Randomization will be done centrally via IVRS/IWRS after subject eligibility is established and prior 
to treatment. Every effort should be made to minimize the time between randomization and starting the 
study drug. It is recommended that subjects commence study drug as soon as possible after 
randomization.  
Separate randomization schedules will be generated for Cohorts A and B as follows:  
1. Cohort A: Subjects with mCRPC with previous NHA among subjects with either a 
BRCA1, BRCA2  or ATM  qualif ying gene mutation. Subjects will be randomized either to 
olaparib or investigator choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate.  
2. Cohort B: This cohort will assess olaparib activity among subjects in the same setting but 
with qualifying mutations among 12  other genes involved in the HRR pathway ( BARD1, 
BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, PPP2R2A, RAD51B, RAD51C, 
RAD51D and RAD54L ). Subjects will be randomized either to olaparib or investigator 
choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate  
For each su bject, the IVRS/IWRS will identify a unique kit ID number corresponding to the 
randomization code matching the treatment arm assigned to the subject. Following treatment 
allocation, the first dose of study medication should be administered to the subject a fter completion of 
study visit procedures. At subsequent dispensing visits, the subject will be dispensed medication with 
the kit ID as allocated by the IVRS/IWRS.  
If a subject receives incorrect treatment at any time during the study, the center must imm ediately 
notify the AstraZeneca representative and IVRS/IWRS contact for immediate correction, where 
possible.

It is prohibited to consume grapefruit juice while on olaparib therapy.  
3.8.2 Contraception  
Subjects must use a condom during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of ol aparib when 
having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of childbearing potential.  Female 
partners of male subjects should also use a highly effective form of contraception (as described in 
Appendix F) if they are of childbearing poten tial.  Subjects should not donate sperm throughout the 
period of taking olaparib and for 3 months following the last dose of olaparib.  
For details of acceptable methods of contraception refer to Appendix F Acceptable Birth Control 
Methods.  
3.8.3 Blood donation  
Subjects should not donate blood or plasma while participating in this study and for 3 months 
following the last dose of study treatment.  
3.9 Discontinuation of investigational product  
Subjects may be discontinued from investigational product (IP) in the follow ing situations:  
• Subject decision: The subject is at any time free to discontinue treatment, without 
prejudice to future treatment  
• Adverse Event  
• Severe non -compliance with the study protocol  
• Bone marrow findings consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome (MD S)/acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML)  
• Objective radiographic progression by blinded independent central review (BICR) as 
defined in Section 5.1.2 .  
• Unequ ivocal clinical progression:  
− Cancer pain requiring initiation of chronic administration of opioids, or  
− Immediate need to initiate cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgical 
intervention for complications due to tumor progression, or  
− Deterioration in ECOG performance status to ≥ Grade 3.  
• Initiation of restricted anticancer therapy (see Section 7.7).  
The reason for IP discontinu ation will be recorded in the eCRF.

Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  49 (170) 3.9.1 Procedures for discontinuation of a subject from investigational product  
By discontinuing from IP, the subject is not withdrawn from the study. Subjects should be followed for 
progression (if discontinuation in the abse nce of progression) and OS following treatment 
discontinuation as per the study schedule.  If a subject is withdrawn from study, see Section 3.10. 
Any subject discontinuing investigational product should be seen at 30 days post discontinuation for 
the evaluations outlined in the study schedule (see study schedule Table 3). The subject’s tumor status 
should be assessed clinically and, if appropriate, disease progression should be confirmed by 
radiological assessment. After discontinuation of study medication, the principal Investigator/Sub -
Investiga tor will perform the best possible observation(s), test(s) and evaluation(s) as well as give 
appropriate medication and all possible measures for the safety of the subject. In addition, they will 
record on the eCRF the date of discontinuation, the reasons,  manifestation and treatment at the time of 
discontinuation. If subjects discontinue study treatment, the AstraZeneca monitor must be informed 
immediately. Subjects will be required to attend the treatment discontinuation visit (see study schedule 
Table 3). The subject should return all study medication.  
After discontinuation of the study medication at any point in the study, all ongoing AEs or SAEs must  
be followed until resolution unless, in the Investigator’s opinion the condition is unlikely to resolve 
due to the subjects underlying disease, or the subject is lost to follow up (see Section 6.3.2 ). All new 
AEs and SAEs occurring during the 30 calendar days after the last dose of study medication must be 
reported (if SAEs, they must be reported to AstraZeneca within 24 hours as describ ed in Section 6.4) 
and followed to resolution as above. Subjects should be seen at least 30 days after discontinuing study 
medication to collect an d / or complete AE information. For guidance on reporting adverse events after 
the 30 day follow up period see Section 6.3.1.1 . 
After completing the  treatment discontinuation visit and the 30 day safety follow -up visit, subjects will 
proceed directly with follow -up visits as defined in the study schedule (see Table 4). For subjects who 
discontinue study treatment after BICR progression, the first 12 week follow -up visit will be 12 weeks 
after the disco ntinuation of study treatment. Subjects who discontinue therapy prior to radiographic 
progression will continue with follow -up visits every 8 weeks per the original schedule until 
documentation of radiographic progression by BICR (see Table 4). There is no plan for BICR to read 
any scans dated after the date of data cut -off (DCO ) for the primary analysis. There will be no need to 
request confirmation of BICR PD after this time point, and the investigator -assessed radiographic 
progression will prevail.  
All adverse events occurring after the 30 day 
safety follow -up visit will be assessed at the first follow -up visit .   
While it is preferred that follow -up visits post radiographic progression and discon tinuation of study 
treatment are conducted in -person, subjects may proceed with a modified follow -up (i.e. , through 
regular telephone contacts, every 12 weeks or a contact at study closure, if agreed to by the subject and 
in compliance with local data priv acy laws/practices). All subjects will be followed until death or end 
of study (see Section 9.3). 
3.10 Criteria for study withdrawal  
The term withdrawa l from the study refers to both discontinuation from study treatment and study 
assessments.  
 

Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  50 (170) Reasons for withdrawal from the study:  
• Voluntary withdrawal by the subject who is at any time free to discontinue their 
participation in the study, without prejud ice to further treatment.  
• Incorrectly enrolled subjects i.e., the subject does not meet the required 
inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study.  
• Subject lost to follow -up. 
• Death.  
All subjects, unless they have refused to participate in any further follow –up, will be followed for 
survival up until death or end of study. If a subject wishes to withdraw from the study, this should be 
clearly documented in the eCRF.  
3.10.1  Screen failures  
Screen failures are subjects who do not fulfill the eligibility criteri a for the study, and therefore must 
not be randomized. These subjects should have the reason for study withdrawal recorded as ‘screen 
failed’ (i.e., subject does not meet the required inclusion/exclusion criteria) in IVRS/IWRS.  This 
reason for study withd rawal is only valid for screen failures (not randomized subject).  
In exceptional cases, where a subject has met HRR status and has screened failed eligibility for other 
criteria, the subject may be re -evaluated for study eligibility, as determined by the A straZeneca 
physician, provided that they have not previously been randomized, assigned or received treatment 
(see Section 4.1.1 ). 
3.10.2  Withdrawal of the  informed consent  
Subjects are free to withdraw from the study (investigational product and assessments) at any time, 
without prejudice to further treatment.  
A subject who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) for withdrawal and the 
presence of any adverse events (AE). If the subject prefers not to provide a reason for withdrawal, it 
should be recorded as such. The Investigator will follow up AEs outside of the clinical study. The 
subject will return electronic PRO (ePRO) devices.  
If a subject withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her enrol lment/randomization/treatment 
code cannot be reused. Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced.  
If a subject withdraws consent, they will be specifically asked if they are withdrawing consent to:  
• further participation in the study including any further follow up (e.g., survival calls)  
• the use of any samples (see Section 5.7.4 ) 
The status of ongoing, withdrawn (from the study) and “lost to follow -up” subjects at the time of an 
overall survival analysis should be obtained by the site personnel by checking the subject notes, 
hospital records, contacting the subject’s gene ral practitioner and checking publicly available death 
registries.  In the event that the subject has actively withdrawn consent to the processing of their

Date 07 March  2019  
 
  51 (170) personal data, the vital status of the subject can be obtained by site personnel from publicly avail able 
resources where it is possible to do so under applicable local laws.  
3.11 Discontinuation of the study  
The study may be stopped if, in the judgment of AstraZeneca, trial subjects are placed at undue risk 
because of clinically significant findings that are not considered to be consistent with continuation of 
the study.  
Regardless of the reason for termination, all data available for the Subject at the time of 
discontinuation of follow -up must be recorded in the CRF. All reasons for discontinuation of treatme nt 
must be documented.   
In terminating the study, the Sponsor will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection 
of the subjects’ interests.

criteria for SAE is not met, such as for non -melanoma skin cancers, see Section 6.2) even after 
disco ntinuation of therapy and regardless of investigator’s assessment of causality or knowledge of the 
treatment arm (see Sections 6.1.1  and 6.3.1.1 ).

local regulations. In the event that the subject has actively withdrawn consent to the processing of their 
personal data the vital status of the subject can be obtained by site personnel from publicly available 
resources where it is possible to do so  under applicable local laws (see Section 3.10.2 ). In addition to their

  63 (170) 4.1 Enrol lment/screening period  
At screening, consenting subjects are assessed to ensure that they meet eligibility criteria. Subjects 
who do not meet these eligibility criteria must not be randomized. All screening and enrol lment 
procedures will be performed according the assessment schedules in Table 2. 
Written informed consent and any locally required privacy act document authorization must be 
obtained prior to performing any protocol -specific procedures, including screening and baseline 
evaluations.    
All subjects are required to consent to supply a sa mple of their tumor (archived or newly biopsied) (see 
Section 5.7.2 ) sufficient for testing by the Lynparza HRR Assay, for entry into this study. A ll subjects 
will also be required to consent to a blood sample for exploratory biomarker research (see Section 
5.7.4 ). 
Screening evaluations (Part 2 ) may be performed over more than one visit and should be completed 
within the 28 day period prior to randomization within IVRS/IWRS. The subject will be entered into 
IVRS/IWRS upon enro llment into Screening (Part 1), prior to any other procedures being pe rformed. 
At screening Part 2, the subject will be supplied with an electronic hand -held device to record patient 
reported outcome questionnaires and opiate analgesic use logging (see Section 5.3 for further details). 
Subjects will be asked to complete ePRO for 7 consecutive days before randomization. All efforts 
should be made to ensure that all ePRO data is collected.  
The subject’s eligibility should  be evaluated during the screening period with the relevant 
documentation recorded in the subject source records and eCRF. If the subject is determined to be 
ineligible for study, during screening Part 1, they may be withdrawn by way of a telephone contact  (for 
collection of SAE information only).  
4.1.1 Re-Screening  
Subjects who are ineligible for study based on HRR status will be screen failed in the IVRS/IWRS and 
eCRF, should not continue with any remaining screening evaluations and are not permitted to enter the 
main study phase or be re -screened for study.  
Subjec ts who meet HRR eligibility at screening and screen fail during screening Part 2 may be 
considered for re -screening after discussion with the AstraZeneca physician.  
Where a subject is permitted to re -screen (by the AstraZeneca study physician), the same E -code 
initially assigned by  the IVRS/IWRS should be used. The rationale and approval will be documented 
in the investigator study file (ISF).  
4.2 Treatment period  
All procedures to be conducted during the treatment period will be performed according to the 
assessment schedule (see Table 3). 
Until the primary rPFS analysis, following randomization in IVRS/IWRS, subjects should receive 
assigned study treatment  until determined to have objective radiographic progression according to 
Section 5.1.2  by BICR, or until unable to tolerate study treatment (see S ection 7.2). After the date of 
DCO for the primary analysis , subjects should receive treatment until radiographic  progression as 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  64 (170) assessed by the investigator. Note that bone progression requires confirmation by a second bone scan ≥ 
6 weeks later (see Section 5.1.2 ). 
In the ab sence of tolerability issues, every effort should be made to keep subjects on assigned study 
treatment until progression by BICR. If the investigator makes a decision to initiate alternative anti -
cancer therapy before BICR -assessed radiological progression , unequivocal clinical progression needs 
to be documented as per Section 3.9. If study treatment is discontinued due to unequivocal clinical 
progres sion (in the absence of BICR -assessed radiographic progression), the investigator should obtain 
imaging scans at the treatment discontinued visit (see Table 3).  This inc ludes confirmatory bone 
scans. Imaging assessments will continue until documentation of progression by BICR, irrespective of 
initiation of subsequent anti -cancer therapy (see Table 4). 
Access to olaparib for subjects randomized to comparator arm will only be possible upon BICR -
assessed progression , or after the date of DCO for the primary analysis, upon  investigator -assessed 
radiographic progression , prior to initiation of subsequent anti -cancer therapy (see Section 4.2.1 ). 
4.2.1 Subjects who switch to olaparib  
Once subjects on the investigator choice control arm are determined to have objective radiological 
progression by BICR, or after the date of DCO  for the primary analysis, subjects are determi ned to 
have radiographic  progression by the investigator, they will be eligible to receive olaparib (300 mg 
bid) and will follow the study schedule as per Table 5, as well as all safety reporting and medical 
management guidance ( Section 6) and investigational product use and concomitant medication 
restrictions ( Section 7). 
If a subject has b een deemed to have objective disease progression according to investigator 
assessment, but not by BICR, he is not eligible to switch to olaparib at that time. Subjects should 
continue to receive randomized study treatment until progression determined by BI CR. 
The following criteria must be met in order for a subject to switch to olaparib:  
• No intervening anti -cancer therapy following discontinuation of randomized treatment  
• Any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy should be controlled, and be no greater t han 
CTCAE grade 1 at the time of starting olaparib treatment  
Subjects who switch to olaparib may continue treatment with olaparib as long as in the investigator’s 
opinion they are benefiting from treatment and they do not meet any other discontinuation cri teria. 
If subjects are not eligible to switch to olaparib, or choose not to switch, they will enter into the follow -
up phase of the study (see Table 4), and other treatment options should be discussed by the 
investigator.  
4.3 Follow -up period  
Descriptions of the procedures for this period are included in the study schedule (see Table 4) with 
exceptions of the following specific requirements  for the follow -up period:  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  65 (170) If treatment is discontinued due to BICR -assessed radiographic progression , or after the primary rPFS 
analysis due to investigator -assessed radiographic progression (see Section 5.1.2 ), the subject may 
select from two follow -up options, in order of preferred approach:  
1. The subject will return for all regular clinical visits and perform all scheduled assessments 
until end of s tudy (see Table 4) or, 
2. The subject will be followed up every 12 weeks by telephone call until end of study, and 
continuing ePRO completion for the first 6 months after treatment discontinuation. No 
further stu dy procedures will be performed.  
For option 2, AEs including SAEs and subsequent anti -cancer therapies are the minimum elements to 
be collected at each contact. Subjects may switch from a higher contact option to a lower contact 
option, during the follow -up period. Subjects who elect not to undergo follow -up after discontinuing 
from the initial treatment period will be withdrawn from study.   
5. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
The RAVE Web Based Data Capture (WBDC) system will be used for data collection and query 
handling.   The investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the eCRFs as specified in the study 
protocol and in accordance with the instructions provided.  
The investigator ensures the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data recorded and of the 
provision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA). The 
investigator will sign the completed eCRFs. A copy of the completed eCRFs will be archived at the 
study site.  
5.1 Efficacy assessments  
5.1.1 Imaging tumor assessments  
All imaging a ssessments including unscheduled visit scans should be collected on an ongoing basis 
and sent to an AstraZeneca (AZ) appointed Clinical Research Organization (CRO) to enable 
independent central review. Upon investigator -assessed objective disease progressi on as defined in 
Section 5.1.2 , review of all scans will be conducted by BICR. The results will be reported back to the 
sites. All imaging assessmen ts and study treatment should continue until objective disease progression 
as assessed by BICR (see Figure 3).  
The baseline assessments of all imaging modalities should be performed as close as possible to the 
start of study treatment and no more than 4 weeks ( -28 days) before randomization. Follow ing the 
baseline assessment, subsequent assessments should be performed every 8 weeks (± 7 days), relative to 
the date of randomization, until objective radiological disease progression by BICR, even after 
investigator has deemed objective disease progress ion, irrespective of treatment decisions or dose 
interruptions.  The assessments by different imaging modalities can be done on different days but 
should all be performed within assessment schedule. It is important to follow the imaging assessment 
schedule  as closely as possible (see Table 3). If scans are performed outside of scheduled visit window 
Clinical Study Protocol

Date 07 March  2019  
 
  66 (170) interval, and the subject has not progressed, every at tempt should be made to perform the subsequent 
scans at their originally scheduled time points.  
In order for subjects randomized to investigator choice arm to be eligible to switch to olaparib, 
scheduled tumor assessments must continue until objective radi ological disease progression as 
assessed by BICR, without any intervening systemic anti -cancer therapy following discontinuation of 
randomized study treatment (see Section 4.2.1 ). 
Until the primary rPFS analysis all imaging assessment and study treatment should continue until 
objective disease progression as assessed by BICR (see Figure 3). There is no plan for BICR to read 
any scans dated after the date of DCO for the primary analysis. There will be no need to request 
confirmation of BICR PD after this time point, and the investigator -assessed radiographic progression 
will prevail.  
Radiological examinations performed during the study should be retained at site as source data.  
Figure 3 Assessment of Progression by BICR  (prior to primary rPFS analysis ) 
 
5.1.1.1  CT and MRI scans tumor assessments (RECIST 1.1)  
The imaging modalities used for RECIST assessment will be CT or MRI scans of the chest, abdomen 
and pelvis. Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally investigated based on the 
signs an d symptoms of individual subjects. At assessments subsequent to baseline, any other sites at 
which new disease is suspected should also be appropriately imaged. The methods of assessment of 
tumor burden used at baseline must be used at each subsequent asse ssment. In this study, bone lesions 
will not be included in the RECIST soft tissue assessment.   

Clinical Study Protocol

Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  67 (170) 5.1.1.2  Bone scans tumor assessment (based on PCWG3 criteria)  
Bone lesions will be assessed by bone scintigraphy commonly performed with Technetium -99 (bone 
scans). Bon e lesions will be assessed by bone scan and will not be part of the RECIST 1.1 malignant 
soft tissue assessment. Positive hot spots on the bone scan should be considered significant and 
unequivocal sites of malignant disease to be recorded as metastatic bo ne lesions.  
5.1.2 Tumor evaluation  
Disease progression will be deemed to have occurred if one or more of the following criteria is met:  
• Soft tissue disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1  
• Bone lesion progression by bone scan (see Table 6) 
• Death.  
RECIST 1.1 criteria will be used to assess subject response to treatment by determining progression 
free survival (PFS) times, objective response rates (ORR), and duration of response (DoR). 
Categorization of objective tumor response assessment will be based on the RECIST 1.1 criteria of 
response: CR (complete response), PR (parti al response), SD (stable disease) and PD (progression of 
disease). Target lesion (TL) progression will be calculated in comparison to when the tumor burden 
was at a minimum (i.e. , smallest sum of diameters previously recorded on study). In the absence of 
progression, tumor response (CR, PR, and SD) will be calculated in comparison to the baseline tumor 
measurements obtained before starting treatment. If the Investigator is in doubt as to whether 
progression has occurred, particularly with regard to NTLs or the appearance of a new lesion, it is 
advisable to continue treatment and reassess the tumor burden at the next scheduled assessment or 
sooner if clinically indicated. The RECIST 1.1 guidelines for measurable, non -measurable, target and 
non-target lesions and the objective tumor response criteria are presented in Appendix E. For ORR, a 
visit response of CR or PR must be confirmed by a later scan conducted at least 4 weeks after the 
initial response is observed.  
Bone lesions will be assessed by bone scan and  will not be part of the RECIST 1.1 malignant soft 
tissue assessment.  The definition for bone progression is based on PCWG3 criteria.  Positive hot spots 
on the bone scan should be considered significant and unequivocal sites of malignant disease to be 
recorded as metastatic bone lesions.   
Progression on a bone scan is defined as:  
At the 8 week scan:  
If 2 or more  new metastatic bone lesions are observed on the first 8 -week scan, the confirmatory scan 
performed (at least 6 weeks later), must show 2 or more  additional new  metastatic bone lesions (for a 
total of 4 or more new  metastatic bone lesions since the baseline assessment).  
Note - The first bone scan completed after baseline will be considered the ‘8 -week scan’ regardless if taken at 
week 8 or at an u nscheduled assessment.  
After the 8 week scan:  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  68 (170) For subjects without progression  at the 8 week scan, this scan now serves as new baseline for all 
subsequent scans, i.e. , all bone scans after week 8 are compared to the week 8 scan. If 2 or more  new 
metastatic bone lesions are observed on scans obtained after the first 8 -week assessment (compared to 
week 8 scan), a confirmatory scan performed at least 6 weeks later  and pref erably no later than the 
next scheduled visit must show the persistence of, or an increase in, the number of metastatic bone 
lesions compared to the prior scan.  
The date of progression is the date of the first scan documenting the 2 new lesions. If the Inv estigator 
is in doubt as to whether progression has occurred, it is advisable to continue study treatment and 
reassess the bone lesion status at the next scheduled assessment, or sooner if clinically indicated.   
The requirements for determination and conf irmation of radiographic progression by either bone scan 
(bone progression) or CT/MRI (soft tissue progression) are summarized in Table 6: 
Table 6 Requirements for documentation of progression.  
Visit Date  Criteria for Bone Progression  Criteria for Soft Tissue Progression  
Week 8  • 2 or more new lesion compared to 
baseline bone scan.  
• Requires confirmation scan  at least 6 
weeks later with > 2 additional lesions 
compared to week 8 scan  • Progressive disease on CT or MRI 
by RECIST 1.1  
• No confirmation scan required.  
Week 16 or 
later • 2 or more new lesions compared to 
week 8  bone scan.  
• Requires confirmation scan  at least 6 
weeks later for persistence or increase 
in number of lesions  • Progressive disease on CT or MRI 
by RECIST 1.1  
• No confirmation scan required.  
 
It is important to follow the assessment schedule as closely as possible.  Please refe r to the study 
schedule in Table 3 and Table 4. 
Central reading of scans  
All imaging assessments including unscheduled visit scans should be collected on an ongoing basis 
and sent to an AstraZeneca (AZ) appointed Clinical Research Organiz ation (CRO) to enable blinded 
independent central review (BICR). Upon documentation of radiographic progression by the 
investigator, all imaging assessments for the given subject, including unscheduled visit scans, will be 
reviewed by BICR. Results of this  independent review will be communicated to investigators. Subjects 
should continue imaging assessments until BICR -assessed progression (see Section 5.1.1 ). 
An independent review of all scans used in the assessment of tumors will be conducted prior to the 
primary analysis of rPFS, including for subjects without investigator -assessed progression.  
The primary analysis for this study will be based on th e blinded independent central review of all 
radiological scans (CT/MRI and bone scans).  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  69 (170) After the primary rPFS analysis, central review of scans will no longer be required, and investigators 
will be advised when to stop sending copies of the scans to the C RO conducting the central review. All 
treatment decisions will be based on site assessment of scans after rPFS analysis. Ongoing collection 
of site review tumor assessment is required and must be recorded in the eCRF.  
 
 
5.1.3 Second progression  
Following objective radiographic progression by BICR, copies of the patient’s radiological scans are 
no longer required  to be sent for central review.  Patients will be assessed every 12 weeks for a second 
progression (using patient’s status at first progression as the reference for assessment of second 
progression).  A patient’s progression status is defined according to l ocal standard clinical practice and 
may involve both radiographic and clinical prog ression (not PSA progression). RECIST 1.1 and 
PCWG3 assessments will not be collected for assess ment of PFS2. The date of PFS2 assessment and 
investigator opinion of progres sion status (progressed or non -progressed) at each assessment will be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
5.1.4 Symptomatic skeletal related events (SSRE)  
SSREs will be assessed at each visit during the treatment phase, up to and including the study 
treatment discontinued visit (see Table 3). An SSRE is defined as use of radiation therapy to bone in 
order to prevent or relieve skeletal complications, occurrence of new symptomatic pathological bone 
fractures (vertebral or non -vertebral, resulting from minimal or no trauma), occurrence of spinal cord 
compre ssion, or a tumor related orthopedic surgical intervention.  
The occurrence of a SSRE alone, in the absence of disease progression, is discouraged as a reason to 
discontinue treatment or to initiate new systemic anti -cancer therapy.  
5.1.5 PSA Assessments  
Blood sa mples will be collected for PSA assessment at baseline and at each visit during the treatment 
phase, up to and including the study treatment discontinued visit (see Table 3). The samples will be 
analyzed by central laboratory.  In order to prevent early withdrawal from treatment phase, PSA results 
will not be sent back to sites prior to final analysis . 
Samples will be collected, labelled, stored and ship ped as detailed in the Laboratory manual.  
5.2 Safety assessments  
5.2.1 Laboratory safety assessments  
Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and 
urinalysis will be taken at the times indicated in the Study schedule ( see Table 2, Table 3 and Table 5). 
All samples unless otherwise indicated will be centrally assessed by central laboratories. Instructions 
for sample collection, labeling, processing, storage, and shipment will be provided in a separate 
laboratory manual provided to the sites. The volume of blood for collection from each subject for these 
assessments is presented in the laboratory manual.  
Additional safety samples may be collected if clinically indicated at the discretion of the Investigator. 
If app licable, the date, time of collection will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.

5.2.3 ECG  
5.2.3.1  Resting 12 -lead ECG  
ECGs are required within 7 days prior to starting study treatment and when clinically indicated.  
Twelve -lead ECGs will be obtained after the subject has been rested in a supine position for at least 5 
minutes in each case.  The Investigator or designated physician will review the paper copies of each of 
the timed 12 -lead ECGs on each of the study days when they are collected.  
ECGs will be recorded at 25 mm/sec. All ECGs should be assessed locally as to whether they are 
clinically  significantly abnormal / not clinically significantly abnormal. If there is a clinically 
significant abnormal finding, the Investigator will record it as an AE on the eCRF. The original ECG 
traces must be stored in the subject medical record as source dat a. 
5.2.4 Vital signs  
Weight will be assessed at screening and baseline according to the Study Schedule (see Table 2, Table 
3 and Table 5) and as clinically indicated at any other time.  
 
Any changes in vital signs should be recorded as an AE, if applicable. For information on how AEs 
based on changes in vital signs should be recorded and reported, see Section 6.3. 
5.2.4.1  Pulse and blood pressure (BP)  
Blood pressure and pulse will be assessed at screening and baseline according to the Study Schedule 
(see Table 2, Table 3 and Table 5) and as clinically indicated at any other time.  
Blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured preferably using a semi automatic BP recording device 
with an appropriate cuff size after 10 minutes rest.   
The date of collection and measurement will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  
5.2.4.2  Body temperature  
Body temperature will be me asured in degrees Celsius according to local practice at screening, 
baseline and as clinically indicated (see Table 2, Table 3 and Table 5). 
The date of collection and measurement will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  
5.3 Other assessments  
5.3.1 Patient reported outcomes  
Patient -reported outcome (PRO) is an umbrella term referring to all outcomes and symptoms that are 
directly reported by the subject. PROs have become a significant endpoint when evaluating the 
Clinical Study Protocol

  72 (170) effectiveness of treatments in clinical studies. The following five PRO questionnaires will be 
electronically administered in this study: Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI -SF), Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Prostate Cancer (FAC T-P); patient -reported outcomes version of the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO -CTCAE); the Patient Global Impression of 
Change (PGIC); and the EuroQol 5 -dimension, 5 -level health state utility index (EQ -5D-5L; see 
Appendix G). Analgesic  use will be collected using an electronic analgesic -use log using the ERT 
Medication ModuleTM (analgesic log).  
Each center must allocate responsibility for monitoring compliance with completion of the PRO 
questionnaires and the analgesic -use log described in this Section to a specific individual(s) (e.g., a 
Research Nurse). The Clinical Team will arrange for releva nt training in the setup of the electronic 
device and training subjects in how to self -administer the questionnaires and analgesic -use log using 
the electronic device. Subjects should complete the questionnaires in accordance with the study 
schedules (see Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5). Subjects must complete the BPI -SF and analgesic log, 
the FACT -P, the PGIC and the EQ -5D-5L prior to completing the PRO -CTCAE. The significance and 
relevance of the d ata should be explained carefully to participating subjects to ensure they comply with 
data collection. Subjects should complete all required baseline electronic PRO questionnaires and 
analgesic log before any treatment is initiated.  
5.3.1.1  BPI-SF 
The BPI -SF (se e Appendix G) is a validated, 15 -item domain -specific instrument designed to assess 
the severity of pain and the impact/interference of pain on daily functions ( Cleeland and Ryan 1994 ). 
The BPI -SF will be scored according to the user guide ( Cleeland 2009 ). All BPI -SF pa in items 
including “worst pain” is scored on a 0 -10 numeric rating scale (NRS) with 0=No Pain and 10=Worst 
Pain Imaginable. This instrument consists of 2 domains: pain severity and pain interference. The pain 
severity domain consists of 4 items (item #3. I tem #4, item #5, and item #6) which assess pain at its 
“worst,” “least,” “average,” and “now” (current pain) respectively on the 11 -point NRS. These 4 items 
may be averaged as a composite pain severity score or they may  be interpreted individually ( Dworkin 
et al 2005 , Turk et al 2006 , Dworkin et al 2008  and Food and Drug Administration 2009 ). In this 
study, the “worst pain” (item 3) will be used as a single item in assessing pain progression. A 
composite pain severity score from all the 4 items will also be evaluated as ‘pain severity progression’. 
A 2- or more point change in the average pain severity or in “worst pain” item is considered clinically 
meaningful.  
The pain interference domain includes 7 items: general activity (item #9A), mood (item #9B), walking 
ability (item #9C), normal work (item #9D), relations with other people (item #9E), sleep (item #9F) , 
and enjoyment of life (item #9G). The pain interference items are also answered on an 11 -point NRS 
from 0 (Does not interfere) to 10 (Completely interferes). Subjects are asked to recall their symptoms 
as well as pain interference with daily activities i n the past 24 hours. The pain interference domain is 
scored as the mean of the 7 interference items. Based on the BPI -SF scoring manual, the following 
items are not used in scoring pain severity or pain interference domains: items #1, #2, #7 and #8. Item 
#7 (a free text field) describing pain medication use is captured separately in more detail using the 
Analgesic Log.  
Subjects will complete the BPI -SF daily on the ePRO device for the 7 days prior to day 1 
randomization visit and every 4 weeks as outlined in the study schedule (see Table 3, Table 4 and 
Table 5). The “7 consecutive days prior to randomization” does not have to be the  immediately 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  73 (170) preceding 7 days prior to randomization. These 7 consecutive days can be anywhere within the 28 days 
screening window. Average worst pain, composite pain severity and pain interference will be 
computed when a subject completes the diary for at  least 4 of the 7 days. The 4 days do not have to be 
consecutive but should be within the 7 consecutive days timeframe.  
5.3.1.2  FACT -P 
The FACT -P (Appendix G) is a disease -specific 39 -item questionnaire included for the purpose of 
assessing health -related quality of life (HRQoL) and prostate cancer -specific symptoms.  It is a well -
established measure of HRQoL/health status commonly used in prostate cancer clinical studies.  The 
FACT -P was developed specifically for patients with advanced prostate cancer and has bee n found to 
be reliable and valid in this population ( Esper et al 1997 ).  The FACT -P consists of 5 subscales: 
Physical Well -Being (PWB; 7 items), Functi onal Well -Being (FWB; 7 items), Emotional Well -Being 
(EWB; 6 items), Social Well -Being (SWB; 7 items), and Additional Concerns or Prostate Cancer 
Subscale (PCS) specific to prostate cancer (12 items).  The PCS relate to prostate -specific questions, 
which i nclude sexuality, bowel/bladder function, and pain ( Esper et al 1997 ). All FACT -P questions 
are scored on a 5 -point Likert scale from 0 to 4 (0 being not at all and 4 being very much).  Negatively 
stated items are reversed by subtracting the response from 4.  After reversing proper items, all subscale 
items are summed to a total, which is the subscale score.  For all subscales, symptoms index, and 
indiv idual item scores, the higher the score, the better the HRQoL /symptom. Thus, a score of 0 is a 
severely symptomatic patient, and the highest possible score is an asymptomatic patient. In addition to 
the Total and Subscale scores, the FACT -P also supports t he calculation of a Trial Outcome Index 
(TOI) score (the sum of the PWB, FWB and PCS scores), and the FACT Advanced Prostate Symptom 
Index 6 (FAPSI -6), a symptom score made up of 6 items from within the FACT -P (pain – 3 items, 
fatigue – 1 item, weight loss  – 1 item, and concerns about the condition getting worse – 1 item). 
Changes from baseline in all of these scores will be assessed, in addition to time to deterioration in the 
scores. The FACT -P will be measured at the times outlined in the study schedules  (see Table 3, Table 
4 and Table 5). 
Scoring of the FACT -P will be based on the user manual. Higher scores e quate to better quality of life. 
If less than 50% of the subscale items are missing from a returned questionnaire, the subscale score 
will be calculated by replacing the missing items with the mean of the non -missing items in the scale. 
If 50% or more of t he items are missing, that visit will be treated as missing  
5.3.1.3  PRO -CTCAE  
The PRO -CTCAE is included to address tolerability from the patients’ perspective. It was developed 
by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The PRO -CTCAE will only be administered in thos e countries 
where a linguistically validated version exists. It was developed in recognition that collecting symptom 
data directly from patients using PRO tools can improve the accuracy and efficiency of symptomatic 
AE data collection. This was based on fi ndings from multiple studies demonstrating that physicians 
and nurses underestimate symptom onset, frequency, and severity in comparison with patient ratings 
(Basch et al 2009  and Litwin et al 1998 ). These symptoms have been converted to patient terms (e.g., 
CTCAE term “myalgia” converted to “aching muscles”). For several symptoms, like fatigue and pain, 
additional questions are asked a bout symptom frequency, severity, and interference with usual 
activities. The items included in the PRO -CTCAE have undergone extensive qualitative review among 
experts and patients. These items have been extensively evaluated in patients with cancer to be clear, 
comprehensible, and measuring the symptom of interest. In this study, 8 items or symptomatic AEs 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  74 (170) constituting 15 questions that are considered relevant for the study treatment arms are selected (see 
Appendix G).  
Subjects will complete the PRO -CTCAE every 2 weeks (starting on Day 1) for the first 8 weeks, then 
every 4 weeks thereafter, until 6 months after discontinuation of study treatment ( see Table 3, Table 4 
and Table 5). 
5.3.1.4  Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)  
The PGIC item is included to  assess how a subject perceives their overall change in health status since 
the start of study treatment. Subjects will choose from response options ranging from “Very Much 
Improved” to “Very Much Worse.” This item is useful in characterizing the overall i mpact of the 
treatment (see Appendix G). The PGIC assessments will be performed at the times outlined in the 
study schedule ( Table 3). 
5.3.1.5  Analgesic Log  
The analgesic log will be implemented using the ERT Medication Module™, a component of the ERT 
eCOA System that serves for accurately tracking subject consumption of concomitant and/or rescue 
medications. The Medication Module allows medication data captur e via the ERT eCOA Universal 
App, followed by the review and management of that data by sites and sponsors. The Medication 
Module provides a consistent, easier -to-use and more efficient tool as compared to paper -based 
reporting. Using the module, subjects will record all analgesic medication dosages & dosage times to 
track pain medications use. The Medication Module includes the following components:  
(a) Global Master Medication List –This list will be developed collaboratively by ERT and 
AstraZeneca and will contain all approved analgesic drug names including generic names 
and formulations. The list will be updated over the course of the study via an approval 
workflow process, when necessary.  
(b) eCOA Universal App Medication Diary – The medication diary will allo w subject s to 
record analgesic medications between visits and identify when any new medications not 
previously approved have been taken.  
(c) Medication Report – This interactive report allows sites to see when their subject s have 
taken new medications, resolve those medications through an approval workflow, and 
remotely  update the tailored list of medications available on a subject s’ eCOA Unive rsal 
App.  
The Analgesic Log is study specific (not generic) and screenshots will be available a nd submitted 
along with the CSP  to IRB/Ethics Committees.  
5.3.1.6  Analgesic Use Scoring  
Although information on all analgesics used by patients in pain control will be c ollected using the 
Analgesic Log, only changes in opiate are considered in pain progression evaluation in line with FDA 
recommendation. Opiates consumed by patients will be converted into oral morphine equivalents as 
defined in Chung et al 2014 . The Analgesic Quantification Algorithm (AQA) developed by Chung et 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  75 (170) al 2014  will be used to quantify and score analgesic use in the study. The AQA is an eight -point scale 
that assigns a score  as follows:  
• 0=No analgesic  
• 1=Non -opioid analgesics  
• 2=Weak opioids (e.g. , codeine, tramadol)  
• 3=Strong opioids ≤75 mg oral morphine equivalence (OME) per day  
• 4=Strong opioids >75 –150 mg OME per day  
• 5=Strong opioids >150 –300 mg OME per day  
• 6=Strong opioi ds >300 –600 mg OME per day  
• 7=Strong opioids >600 mg OME per day  
Average daily opiate use (based on OME) will be computed using the sum of all opiates used over the 
7 days per the assessment schedule (see Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5). The average daily OME w ill 
require at least 4 days of data and will be used to assign the AQA score. An increase of 1 point or more 
in the AQA score from a starting value of 1 or higher OR ≥ 2 points in AQA score from a starting 
value of 0 is considered a clinically meaningful i ncrease in opiate use. Similarly, a decrease of 1 point 
or more in the AQA score from a starting value of 2 or higher is considered a clinically meaningful 
decrease in opiate use.  
5.3.1.7  EQ-5D-5L  
The EQ -5D is a standardi zed measure of health status developed by the European Quality of Life 
(EuroQoL) Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic 
appraisal ( EuroQol Group 1990 ), see Appendix G. Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and 
treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status that can be 
used in the c linical and economic evaluation of health care as well as in population health surveys. The 
questionnaire assesses 5 dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 response options (no probl ems, slight problems, moderate 
problems, severe problems, and extreme problems) that reflect increasing levels of difficulty ( EuroQol 
Group 2013 ). Since 2009, the EuroQoL group has been developing a more sensitive version of the EQ -
5D (the EQ -5D-5L), which expands the range of responses to each dimension from 3 to 5 levels of 
increasing severity ( Herdman et al 2011 ). Preliminary studies indicate that the 5 level (5L) version 
improves upon the properties of the 3 level (3L) measure in terms of reduced ceiling effect, increased 
reliability, and an improved ability to differentiate between different levels of health ( Pickard et al 
2007 , Janssen et al 2008a  and Janssen et al 2008b ). The subject will be asked to indicate his/her 
current healt h state by selecting the most appropriate level in each of the 5 dimensions. The 
questionnaire also includes a visual analogue scale (VAS), where the subject will be asked to rate 
current health status on a scale of 0 to 100, with zero being the worst imag inable health state.  The EQ -
5D-5L will be measured at the times outlined in the study schedule (see Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5).

Date 07 March  2019  
 
  76 (170) 5.3.2 Administration of PRO q uestionnaires  
The PRO instruments will be self -administered by the subjects as ePROs using handheld devices.  The 
analgesic use log using the Medication Module will also be administered electronically alongside the 
ePROs.  
All assessments should be complet ed according to the following parameters:  
• Without assistance from site staff or relatives/friends according to the assessment 
schedules (see  Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5). 
• Before any other study procedures are conducted at a given visit.  
• Before being seen by a study nurse or physician . 
Each center must allocate the responsibility for the administration of th e ePROs to a specific individual 
(e.g., a research nurse or study coordinator) and, if possible, assign a backup person to cover if that 
individual is absent.  Approximately 15 to 30 minutes is required for subjects to complete the 
questionnaires.  Subject s may complete some of the ePROs  at study sites if the assessment time point 
coincides with a scheduled site visit; otherwise, subjects may complete the ePROs at home. Similarly, 
during the post -progression period, subjects should complete ePROs at home or  at the study site if a 
scheduled visit coincides with the time point.  If subjects have had scans or other tests at an outside 
facility or missed a scheduled data collection site visit, ePROs should still be completed by the subject 
at home for that sched uled visit within the window period.  
Subjects should be instructed to complete the BPI -SF (Pain Diary) and the Analgesic Log daily for 7 
consecutive days every 4 weeks (from date of randomization), independent of when site visits are 
scheduled. Baseline B PI-SF (Pain Diary) and Analgesic Log must be completed daily for 7 
consecutive days during the 28 day screening period prior to randomization  
The investigator will arrange for relevant training in the set -up of the electronic device and training 
subjects i n how to self -administer the questionnaires and analgesic use log using the electronic device. 
Subjects should complete the questionnaires in accordance with the study schedules (see Table 3, 
Table 4 and Table 5). Subjects must complete the BPI -SF and Analgesic Log, the FACT -P, and the 
PGIC, EQ -5D-5L, prior to completing the PRO -CTCAE.  
The significance and relevance of the data should be explained ca refully to participating subjects so 
that they are motivated to comply with data collection. Reminders should be sent to subjects at home 
as needed to ensure compliance with the assessment schedules.  
The following best practice guidelines should be follow ed when collecting PRO data via an electronic 
device:  
• PRO questionnaires must be completed prior to any other study procedures (following 
informed consent) and before discussion of disease progression to avoid bias in subject’s 
responses to the questions . 
• When each instrument is due to be completed, the following order should be observed: 
BPI-SF, Analgesic Log, FACT -P, PGIC, EQ -5D-5L, and then PRO -CTCAE .  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  77 (170) • PRO questionnaires must be completed by the subject in private.  
• The research nurse or appointed site st aff must explain to subject the value and relevance 
of study participation and inform them that these questions are being asked to find out, 
directly from them, how they feel.  The research nurse or appointed site staff should also 
stress that the informat ion is confidential.  Therefore, if the subjects have any medical 
problems, they should discuss them with the doctor or research nurse separately from the 
ePRO assessment.  
• The research nurse or appointed site staff must train the subject on how to use the ePRO 
device, using the materials and training provided by the ePRO vendor, and provide 
guidance on whom to call if there are problems with the device if the subject is 
completing the ePRO at home.  
• The research nurse or appointed site staff should remind su bjects that there are no right or 
wrong answers.  
• The research nurse or appointed staff must avoid clarifying items in order to avoid bias.  
• The subject must not receive help from relatives, friends, or clinic staff to answer the 
PRO questionnaires.  If a su bject uses visual aids (e.g., spectacles or contact lenses) for 
reading and does not have them when he attends the clinic, the subject will be exempted 
from completing the PROs at the clinic.  
• Site staff must not read or complete the PRO questionnaires on behalf of the subject.  If 
the subject is unable to read the questionnaire (e.g., is blind or illiterate), that subject is 
exempted from completing PRO questionnaires and may still participate in the study.  
Subjects exempted in this regard should be flagg ed appropriately by the site staff.  
• The subject should be given sufficient time to complete the PRO questionnaires at his or 
her own speed.  
The research nurse or appointed site staff must monitor compliance to ensure all data is captured.  
Compliance must be checked at each study visit to identify problems early.  If a subject’s compliance 
drops below 85%, they will be flagged in the routine compliance report generated by the ePRO system 
and a check -in call from the site to ask the subject if he or she has any difficulties is highly 
recommended.  
5.3.3 Healthcare Resource Use  
To explore the impact of treatment and disease on healthcare resource use. Healthcare resource use 
will be captured including inpatient admissions, ICU and length of stay in hospital. Appropriate 
analyses of resource use will be undertaken to examine the impact of disease and treatment on resource 
use to primarily support the health economic evaluation of AstraZeneca therapies.

  78 (170) 5.3.3.1  Assessment of Healthcare Resource Use  
The study site staff should complete the “Hospital Admission (HOSPAD)” eCRF at the site at every 
scheduled clinic visit up to and including the study treatment discontinuation follow up visit. If the 
subject discontinues study treatment for reasons other than RECIST progressio n, the “HOSPAD” 
eCRF should continue to be administered until progression has been determined by BICR or by 
investigator after primary rPFS analysis (see assessment schedule in Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5). 
5.4 Pharmacokinetics  
5.4.1 Collection of samples  
PK sampling will be performed in  a subset of at least 35 subjects in Cohort A and 15 subjects in 
Cohort B dosed with olaparib and in at least 50 subjects dosed with olaparib in both cohorts at select 
sites.   
PK samples are to be take n as a blood sample (2 mL) for determination of olaparib concentrations in 
plasma. At the Week 4 visit, PK samples will be collected at the following times: Pre -dose ( - 30 min ± 
15 min), and post dose at 30 min ± 15 min, 2 ± 0.5 h, 5 ± 0.5 h and 8 ± 1h. Th e actual date and time of 
dosing on the PK study day and the actual date and time of dosing 3 days prior to the pre -dose sample 
must be recorded.  
Samples will be collected, labeled, stored and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory manual.  
5.4.2 Determination of drug concentration  
Samples for determination of olaparib concentrations in plasma will be analyzed by Covance on behalf 
of AstraZeneca R&D, using a validated bioanalytical method. Full details of the analytical method 
used will be described in a separate b ioanalytical report.  
Full instructions for collection, labeling, storage and shipment of samples are provided in the 
Laboratory manual. Results will only be reported for samples shipped within a timeframe for which 
the stability of olaparib in the samples has been validated and shown to be acceptable.  
5.4.3 Storage and destruction of pharmacokinetic samples  
Pharmacokinetic samples will be disposed of after the Bioanalytical Report finalization or  six months 
after issuance of the draft Bioanalytical Report  (whichever is earlier) unless requested for future 
analyses, where consented to by the subject.    
Pharmacokinetic samples may be destroyed  or anonymized by pooling. Additional analyses may be 
conducted on the anonymized, pooled pharmacokinetic samples to further evaluate and validate the 
analytical method.   Any results from such analyses may be reported separately from the CSR.  
Incurred sample reproducibility analysis, if any, will be performed alongside the bioanalysis of the test 
samples.   The results fr om the evaluation will not be reported in the Clinical Study Report but 
separately in a Bioanalytical Report.  
Any residual back -up PK samples may be used for future exploratory biomarker research (in this case, 
residual back -up PK samples will be shipped t o an AstraZeneca designated biobank; see details in the 
Laboratory Manual).

5.7.2 Collection, Analysis and Reporting of Tumor Samples  
Tumor samples will be collected as detailed in the pathology and genomics testing manual. Subjects 
must consent to provide either an archival tumour block, or a de novo tumour biopsy sample for 
analysis. Consideration should be given to the potential benef it to the subject (should he be eligible for 
study) in the context of the risk posed by the biopsy procedure. Tissue biopsy sampling should be 
conducted in accordance with expert guidelines, only by investigators experienced in performing these 
sampling me thods in appropriate clinical settings. Samples that meet the minimum tumor content and 
tissue volume as specified in the pathology and genomics testing manual will be shipped at Screening 
Part 1 (post confirmation of other (*) marked eligibility criteria,  see Section 3.1 and 3.2) to FMI 
(Cambridge MA, USA) to determine HRR st atus.

  80 (170) If the first biopsy submitted for testing is inconclusive due to technical test failure, a further biopsy 
sample may be submitted for testing. Submission and testing of new samples can only be performed if 
the original testing failed due to technical failure. Please refer to the pathology and genomics testing 
manual for further details regarding retesting procedures.  
For each subject tha t passes tissue sample and sequencing quality control, FMI will generate a report 
specifying presence or absence of qualifying HRR gene mutations. A subject has a qualifying mutation 
if any deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation is found in the HRR genes. A mutation is regarded 
as deleterious if it results in protein truncation (which includes nonsense, frameshift, or consensus 
splice site mutations), or select missense mutations well -known to be deleterious in ClinVar/BIC 
databases in certain genes (BRCA1, BRCA2 , and ATM ). Furthermore, larger scale alterations such as 
genomic truncating rearrangements or homozygous deletions will also be classified as qualifying. 
Subjects without qualifying HRR gene mutations as determined by the Lynparza HRR Assay w ill not 
be eligible for the study.  
 if a subject has a previously confirmed deleterious or 
suspected deleterious mutation in one of the 15 HRR study genes using the FoundationOne® 
assay:  the subject may meet biomarke r testing requirements provided all of the following conditions 
are met:  
(a) The results are from a prior screening of a prostate cancer tissue specimen by the 
commercially available FoundationOne® assay as performed by FMI (Cambridge, MA, 
USA). No other local  testing results or other commercially offered NGS analyses are 
permitted.  
(b) Subject to patient consent, residual DNA (stored at FMI) from the original 
FoundationOne® test will be used to confirm presence of a qualifying gene mutation using 
the Lynparza HRR Assay. Subjects who do not have sufficient residual DNA from their 
original test will be analysed in -silico for qualifying HRR gene mutations using data from 
their previous FoundationOne® test. Upon documented confirmation that FMI has re -
evaluated the subject’s mutation and confirms the presence of a qualifying HRR gene 
mutation, the subject may be randomized provided all other eligibility criteria are met.  
(c) Subjects  who do not have sufficient residual DNA from their original FoundationOne® test 
must confirm availability of sufficient formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor 
sample to carry out central confirmation using the Lynparza HRR Assay. The subject is no t 
required to wait for the results of the Lynparza HRR Assay to proceed with Screening Part 
2 and randomization, assuming all other eligibility criteria are met.  
 the tumor sample for central confirmation should be s hipped to 
Foundation Medicine upon enrol lment.

  81 (170) 5.7.3.1  Screening Part 1: Optional Blood Sample for Germline Testing  
Subjects who consent to provide an optional sample for germline testing will provide a blood sample at 
Screen ing Part 1. The sample will be stored for future testing to explore diagnostic test development 
and thus results will not be available to subjects, or their treating physician.  
 
5.7.3.2  Screening Part 2: Mandatory Blood Sample for Germline Testing  
A significant proportion of tumor mutations are reflective of pre -existing germline mutations. Subjects 
confirmed to have a qualifying HRR gene mutation, will be required to submit a bl ood sample at 
screening Part 2 for central germline analysis. The cancer gene profiling test analyzes the coding 
sequence and select introns of hereditary cancer -related genes, including a subset of the 15 clinical 
study genes, for variants and/or rearrang ements. The results of retrospective germline testing may be 
made available to the treating physician in accordance with local procedures  for research use only .  
5.7.4 Exploratory blood samples for biomarker analysis (e.g. , ctDNA analysis)  
There are two main app roaches for the retrieval of tumor material: to obtain contemporary tissue 
biopsies upon disease progression, or to utilize archival specimens from previous stages of the disease. 
The former approach requires invasive biopsies, where tissue may be limited in quantity and quality 
and archival specimens predate progression to mCRPC, and hence, may not reflect tumor evolution 
and alteration of mutational profile that may have occurred in the intervening time span. In order to 
overcome these risks and limitatio ns in the future, exploratory biomarker research will be conducted. 
Testing will include (but is not limited to):  
• if there is sufficient ctDNA in plasma for mutation testing,  
• if ctDNA in plasma can be used to determine HRR mutation status and  
• the correlation between tumor and plasma mutation status  
Subjects must provide a blood sample at screening Part 1 (see Table 2). The sample is requested prior 
to treatment in order to maximize the probability of detecting ctDNA where the tumor burden is 
relatively high. A second sample will be taken at disease progression (see Table 3 and Table 4).  
Please refer to Laboratory man ual for further details of biomarker blood sample collection, shipping, 
and storage.   
 
5.7.5 Circulating tumor cells (CTCs)  
Whole blood samples will b e taken for analysis of CTC conversion rate using the CellSearch® CTC 
assay at a central lab and the EPIC CTC assay (EPIC, San Diego, CA, USA) for CTC biomarker 
measurement at the times shown in the study schedule (see Table 3 and Table 4).  
 
Samples will be shipped under ambient conditions on the day of acquisition to be received by the 
AstraZeneca appr oved laboratory within 48 hours of blood sampling.  Please refer to the separate 
Laboratory manual for further details of sample collection, shipping, and storage.

  82 (170) 5.7.6 Exploratory use of residual biomarker samples and data generated from 
tumor testing (Optiona l) 
The investigational Lynparza HRR Assay used in this study is being developed for approval as a 
companion diagnostic for olaparib. The Lynparza HRR Assay analyses 15 HRR genes for the presence 
of deleterious or suspected deleterious mutations to determin e eligibility for this study. The underlying 
gene panel used in this investigational test is based on the clinical -grade FoundationOne® cancer gene 
profiling test which analyzes the coding sequence of 310 cancer -related genes plus introns from select 
genes  for variants and/or rearrangements. A full list of all genes is available in the laboratory manual.  
Subjects will be asked to consent to the use of this additional gene data by AstraZeneca for exploratory 
research, biomarker analysis in relation to olapar ib, and development of future diagnostic tests.  
Any residual tumour samples may be used for exploratory research by AstraZeneca (in this case, 
residual samples will be shipped to an AstraZeneca designated Biobank; see details in Laboratory 
manual).  
5.7.7 Storage, re -use and destruction of biological samples  
Biological samples for future research will be retained at AstraZeneca or its designee for a maximum 
of 15 years following the finalization o f the Clinical Study Report  or as per local regulation , after 
which they will be destroyed. The results of this biomarker research will be reported either in the 
Clinical Study Report itself or as an addendum, or separately in a scientific report or publication. The 
results of this biomarker research may be pooled with biomarker data from other studies with the study 
drug to generate hypotheses to be tested in future research.  
5.7.8 Labelling and shipment of biological samples  
The Principal Investigator wil l ensure that samples are labeled and shipped in accordance with the 
Laboratory manual and the Biological Substance, Category B Regulations (materials containing or 
suspected to contain infectious substances that do not meet Category A criteria), see Appen dix B 
‘IATA 6.2 Guidance Document’.  
Any samples identified as Infectious Category A materials are not shipped and no further samples will 
be taken from the subject unless agreed with AstraZeneca and appropriate labeling, shipment and 
containment provisions  are approved.  
5.7.9 Chain of custody of biological samples  
A full chain of custody is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle.  
The Principal Investigator at each center keeps full traceability of collected biological samples from 
the subjects whi le in storage at the center until shipment or disposal (where appropriate) and keeps 
documentation of receipt of arrival.  
The sample receiver keeps full traceability of the samples while in storage and during use until used or 
disposed of or until further shipment and keeps documentation of receipt of arrival.  
AstraZeneca keeps oversight of the entire life cycle through internal procedures, monitoring of study 
sites and auditing of external laboratory providers.  
Samples retained for further use are register ed in the AstraZeneca Biobank system during the entire 
life cycle.

If a Subject withdraws consent to th e use of donated biological samples, the samples will be disposed 
of/destroyed, and the action documented.  If samples are already analyzed , AstraZeneca is not obliged 
to destroy the results of this research.  
The Principal Investigator:  
• Ensures Subjects’ w ithdrawal of informed consent to the use of donated samples is 
notified immediately to AstraZeneca  
• Ensures that biological samples from that Subject, if stored at the study site, are 
immediately identified, disposed of /destroyed, and the action documented  
• Ensures the laboratory(ies) holding the samples is/are informed about the withdrawn 
consent immediately and that samples are disposed of/destroyed, the action documented 
and the signed document returned to the study site  
• Ensures that the Subject and AstraZeneca are informed about the sample disposal.  
AstraZeneca ensures the central laboratory(ies) holding the samples is/are informed about the 
withdrawn consent immediately and that samples are disposed of/destroyed and the action documented 
and returne d to the study site.  
6. SAFETY REPORTING AND  MEDICAL MANAGEMENT  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar 
with the content of this Section.  
6.1 Definition of adverse events  
An adverse event is the dev elopment of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a pre -
existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not 
considered causally related to the product.  An undesirable medical condition can  be symptoms (e.g., 
nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal results of an investigation 
(e.g., laboratory findings, electrocardiogram).  In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable 
medical condition occurrin g at any time, including run -in or washout periods, even if no study 
treatment has been administered.  
The term AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs.  
6.1.1 Olaparib adverse events of special interest  
Adverse events of special interest [AESI] are  events of scientific and medical interest specific to the 
further understanding of olaparib’s safety profile and require close monitoring and rapid 
communication by the investigators to AstraZeneca. An AESI may be serious or non -serious. Adverse 
Events of  Special Interest for olaparib are the Important Potential Risks of MDS/AML, new primary 
malignancy (other than MDS/AML) and pneumonitis.   
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  84 (170) A questionnaire will be sent to any investigator reporting an AESI, as an aid to provide further detailed 
informatio n on the event.  During the study there may be other events identified as AESIs that require 
the use of a questionnaire to help characterize the event and gain a better understanding regarding the 
relationship between the event and study treatment.  
6.2 Definit ions of serious adverse event  
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., run -in, treatment, and 
washout, follow -up), that fulfills one or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life-threatening  
• Requires in -subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions  
• Is a congenital abnormali ty or birth defect  
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
For further guidance on the definition of an SAE, see Appendix A to the Clinical Study Protocol . 
6.3 Recording of adverse events  
6.3.1 Time period for collection of adverse events  
Adverse Events, including Serious Adverse Events, will be collected from the time of signature of 
informed consent throughout the treatment period up to and including the 30 -day fol low-up period*.  
All ongoing and any new AEs/SAEs identified during the 30 calendar days follow -up period after the 
last dose of study medication, must be followed to resolution. After any interim analysis, any ongoing 
AEs/SAEs need to be unlocked and foll owed for resolution.  
*Exception: In screening part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not 
require reporting). From screening part 2 onwards - all AEs/SAEs must be reported.  
6.3.1.1  Adverse events after the 30 day follow up period  
For Pharmacovigilance purposes and characteri zation, any SAE of MDS/AML or new primary 
malignancy occurring after the 30 day follow up period should be reported to AstraZeneca Patient 
Safety regardless of investigator’s assessment of causality or knowledge o f the treatment arm.  
Investigators will be asked during the regular follow up for overall survival if the subject has 
developed MDS/AML or a new primary malignancy and prompted to report any such cases.   
At any time after a subject has completed the stud y, if an Investigator learns of any SAE including 
sudden death of unknown cause, and he/she considers there is a reasonable possibility that the event is 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  85 (170) causally related to the investigational product, the investigator should notify AstraZeneca, Patient 
Safety.  
If subjects who are gaining clinical benefit are allowed to continue study treatment post data cut off 
and/or post study completion then all SAEs must continue to be collected and reported to Patient 
Safety within the usual timeframe.  
Otherwise, after study treatment completion (i.e. , after any scheduled post treatment follow -up period 
has ended) there is no obligation to actively report information on new AEs or SAEs occurring in 
former study subjects. This includes new AEs/SAEs in sub jects still being followed up for survival but 
who have completed the post treatment follow up period (30 days).  
6.3.2 Follow -up of unresolved adverse events  
Any SAE or non -serious adverse event that is ongoing at the time of the 30 -day follow up, must be 
follow ed up to resolution unless the event is considered by the investigator to be unlikely to resolve, or 
the subject is lost to follow up. AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any 
subject with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of t he study, if judged necessary.  
6.3.3 Variables  
The following variables will be collect ed for each AE;  
• AE (verbatim)  
• The date when the AE started and stopped  
• CTCAE grade and changes in CTCAE grade  
• Whether the AE is serious or not  
• Investigator causality rating against the Investigational Product (yes or no), comparator 
drug (yes/no)  
• Action taken with regard to investigational product/comparator drug  
• Outcome.  
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs:  
• Date AE met criteria for serious AE 
• Date Investigator became aware of serious AE  
• AE is serious due to  
• Date of hospitalization  
• Date of discharge

  86 (170) • Probable cause of death  
• Date of death  
• Autopsy performed  
• Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s)  
• Causality assessment in relation t o Other medication  
• Description of AE.  
Severity of AE  
For each episode of an adverse event, all changes to the CTCAE grade attained as well as the highest 
attained CTC grade should be reported.  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 6.2.  An AE of severe intensity need not 
necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but not an SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Section 6.2. On the 
other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke 
but would be an SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Section 6.2. 
The grading scales found in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE 4.03 will be utilized for all 
events with an assigned CTCAE grading. For those events without assigned CTCAE grades the 
recommendation is that the CTCAE criteria that convert mild, moderate and severe events into 
CTCAE grades should be used.  
A copy of the CTCAE version can be downloaded from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation program 
website (http://ctep.cancer.gov).  
6.3.4 Causality collection  
The Investigator will assess causal relationship between Investigational Product and each Adverse 
Event, and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility 
that the event may have been caus ed by the investigational product/comparator drug?’  
For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication and study procedures   Note 
that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as 
‘yes’. 
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix A to the Clinical Study 
Protocol.  
6.3.5 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms  
All AEs spontaneously reported by the subject  or reported in response to the open question from t he 
study personnel: ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last asked?’ , or 
revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the CRF.  When collecting AEs, the 
recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to rec ording a list of signs and symptoms.  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  87 (170) However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of 
the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately.  
6.3.6 Adverse events based on examinati ons and tests  
The results from protocol mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarized in the clinical 
study report.  Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol -mandated laboratory values, vital signs 
and ECG abnormalities should there fore only be reported as AEs if one of the following is met:  
• Any criterion for an SAE is fulfilled . 
• Causes study treatment discontinuation . 
• Causes study treatment interruption . 
• Causes study treatment dose reduction . 
• The investigator believes that the abnormality should be reported as an AE . 
If the deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the 
sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign will be 
considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting Investigator uses the clinical, 
rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anemia versus low hemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical 
signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non -mandated parameters should be reported as 
AE(s).  
Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be 
reported as an AE/SAE.  
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical e xamination as 
compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.  
6.3.7 Hy’s Law  
Cases where a subject shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and 
occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3xULN together with total bilirubin ≥ 2xULN may need to be reported 
as SAEs. Please refer to Appendix D for further instruction on cases of increases in liver biochemistry 
and evaluation of Hy’s Law.  
6.3.8 Disease progression  
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a subject’s condition at tributable to the 
disease for which the investigational product is being studied.  It may be an increase in the severity of 
the disease under study and/or increases in the signs and symptoms of the cancer.  The development of 
new, or progression of existin g metastasis to the primary cancer under study should be considered as 
disease progression and not an AE.  Events, which are unequivocally due to disease progression, 
should not be reported as an AE during the study.  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  88 (170) 6.3.9 New cancers  
The development of a new pr imary cancer (including skin cancer) should be regarded as an AE (see 
Section 6.1.1  Olaparib Adverse Events of Special Interest).  New primary malignancies are tho se that 
are not the primary reason for the administration of the study treatment and have developed after the 
inclusion of the subject into the study.  They do not include metastases of the original cancer.  
Symptoms of metastasis or the metastasis itself should not be reported as an AE/SAE, as they are 
considered to be disease progression.  
6.3.10  Lack of efficacy  
When there is deterioration in the cancer, for which the study treatment(s) is being used, there may be 
uncertainty as to whether this is lack of effica cy or an AE.  In such cases, unless the Sponsor or the 
reporting physician considers that the study treatment contributed to the deterioration of the condition, 
or local regulations state to the contrary, the deterioration should be considered to be a lack  of efficacy 
and not an AE.  
6.3.11  Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the study, or within the protocol -defined 30 -day post -study follow -up 
period after the administration of the last dose of study treatment, must be reported as follows:  
• Death clearly the result of disease progression should be reported to the study monitor at the 
next monitoring visit and should be documented in the DEATH eCRF but should not be 
reported as an SAE.  
• Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to progression of the disease un der study, the 
AE causing the death must be reported to the study monitor as a SAE within 24 hours  (see 
Section 6.4 for further details).  The report should contain a comment regarding the 
co-involvement of progression of disease, if appropriate, and should assign main and 
contributory causes of death.  Th is information can be captured in the ‘death eCRF’.  
• Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as a SAE.  A post -mortem may 
be helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, and if performed a copy of the post -
mortem results should be forward ed to AstraZeneca within the usual timeframes.  
6.4 Reporting of serious adverse events  
All SAEs must be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational product, 
or to the study procedure(s)*. All SAEs will be recorded in the CRF.  
*Exception: In screening part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported.  
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Investigators or other site personnel must inform the 
appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day i.e., im mediately  but no later than 24 hours 
of when he or she becomes aware of it . 
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all the necessary 
information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1  calendar day  of 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  89 (170) initial receipt for fatal and life threatening events and within 5 calendar  days of initial receipt for all 
other SAEs.  
For fatal or life -threatening adverse events where important or relevant information is missing, active 
follow -up is undertaken immediately.  Investigators or other site personnel inform AstraZeneca 
representatives of any follow -up information on a previously reported SAE within one calendar day 
i.e., immediately but  no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aw are of it . 
Once the Investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system, an 
automated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative.  
If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study site perso nnel reports a SAE 
to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone.  
The AstraZeneca representative will advise the Investigator/study site personnel how to proceed.  
Investigators or other site personnel send relevant CRF modules by fax to the de signated AstraZeneca 
representative.  
The reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness is the IB for the AstraZeneca drug  
and the EU Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for the active comparator product.  
6.5 Overdose  
There is currently no specific treatment in the event of overdose with olaparib and possible symptoms 
of overdose are not established.  
Study treatment must only be used in accordance with the dosing recommendations in this protocol. 
Any dose or frequency of dosing that exceeds  the dosing regimen specified in this protocol should be 
reported as an overdose. The Maximum Tolerated Dose is 300 mg bid (tablet).  
Adverse reactions associated with overdose should be treated symptomatically and should be managed 
appropriately.  
• An overdo se with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE modules in the CRF and on the Overdose CRF module.  
• An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose CRF module.  
If an overdose on an AstraZeneca stud y drug occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or 
other site personnel inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives immediately, or no later than 24 
hours  of when he or she becomes aware of it.  
The designated AstraZeneca representative w orks with the  Investigator to ensure that all relevant 
information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site.  
For overdoses associated with a SAE, the standard reporting timelines apply, see Section 6.4.  For 
other overdoses, reporting must occur within 30 days.  
6.6 Pregnancy  
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AstraZeneca.

  90 (170) 6.6.1 Paternal exposure  
Subjects should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 3 months 
following the last dose.  
Pregnancy of the subject’s partners is not considered to be an adverse event. However, the outcome of 
all pregnancies (spontaneous m iscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) should if possible be followed up and documented.  
The outcome of any conception occurring from the date of the first dose until 3 months after the last 
dose shoul d be followed up and documented.  
6.7 Management of toxicities related to olaparib  
Any toxicity observed during the course of the study could be managed by interruption of the dose of 
study treatment or dose reductions. Repeat dose interruptions are allowed as required, for a maximum 
of 4 weeks on each occasion. If the interruption is any longer, the study team must be informed. 
Olaparib can be dose reduced to 250 mg twice daily as a first step and to 200 mg twice daily as a 
second step. If the reduced dose of 2 00 mg twice daily is not tolerable, no further dose reduction is 
allowed and study treatment should be discontinued.   
For management of toxicities for subjects treated with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide see Section 
6.8.  
Once dose is reduced, escalation is not permitted.

Upon recovery dose reduce olaparib to 250 mg twice daily  as a first step 
and to 200 mg twice daily  as a second step in the case of repeat Hb 
decrease.  
 
Common treatable causes of anaemia (e.g., iron, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies and 
hypothyroidism) should be investigated and appropriately managed. In some cases management of 
anemia may require blood transfusions. For cases where subjects develop pro longed hematological 
toxicity (≥2 week interruption/delay in study treatment due to CTC grade 3 or worse anemia and/or 
development of blood transfusion dependence) , refer to Section 6.7.1.3  for the management of this.

maximum of 4 weeks. If repeat CTCAE grade 3 -4 occurrence, dose reduce 
olaparib to 250 mg twice daily as a first step and 200 mg twice daily  as a 
second step.  
 
Adverse event of neutropenia and leukopenia should be  managed as deemed appropriate by the 
investigator with close follow -up and interruption of study drug if CTC grade 3 or worse neutropenia 
occurs.  
Primary prophylaxis with Granulocyte colony -stimulating factor (G -CSF) is not recommended, 
however, if a subj ect develops febrile neutropenia, study treatment should be stopped and appropriate 
management including G -CSF should be given according to local hospital guidelines. Please note that 
G-CSF should not be used within at least 24 h (7 days for pegylated G -CSF) of the last dose of study 
treatment unless absolutely necessary.  
Platelet transfusions, if indicated, should be done according to local hospital guidelines.  
For cases where subjects develop prolonged hematological toxicity (≥2 week interruption/delay in 
study treatment due to CTC grade 3 or worse), refer to Section 6.7.1.3 .

  92 (170) 6.7.1.3  Management  of prolonged hematological toxicities while on study treatment  
If a subject develops prolonged hematological toxicity such as:  
• ≥2 week interruption/delay in study treatment due to CTC grade 3 or worse anemia and/or 
development of blood transfusion dependence  
• ≥2 week interruption/delay in study treatment due to CTC grade 3 or worse neutropenia 
(ANC < 1 x 109/L) 
• ≥2 week interruption/delay in study treatment due to CTC grade 3 or worse 
thrombocytopenia and/or developmen t of platelet transfusion dependence (Platelets < 50 x 
109/L) 
Check weekly differential blood counts including reticulocytes and peripheral blood smear. If any 
blood parameters remain clinically abnormal after 4 weeks of dose interruption, the subject shou ld be 
referred to hematologist for further investigations. Bone marrow analysis and/or blood cytogenetic 
analysis should be considered at this stage according to standard hematological practice. Study 
treatment should be discontinued if blood counts do not  recover to CTC grade 1 or better within 4 
weeks of dose interruption.  
Development of a confirmed myelodysplastic syndrome or other clonal blood disorder should be 
reported as an SAE and full reports must be provided by the investigator to AstraZeneca Pati ent 
Safety. Olaparib treatment should be discontinued if subject’s diagnosis of MDS and/or AML is 
confirmed.  
6.7.2 Management of non -hematological toxicity  
Repeat dose interruptions are allowed as required, for a maximum of 4 weeks on each occasion. If the 
interruption is any longer than this the study monitor must be informed.  Where toxicity reoccurs 
following re -challenge with study treatment, and where further dose interruptions are considered 
inadequate for management of toxicity, then the subject should be considered for dose reduction or 
must permanently discontinue study treatment.  
Study treatment can be dose reduced to 250 mg bd as a first step and to 200 mg bd as a second step. 
Treatment must be interrupted if any NCI -CTCAE grade 3 or 4 adverse event occ urs which the 
investigator considers to be related to administration of study treatment.  
6.7.2.1  Management of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms  
If new or worsening pulmonary symptoms (e.g., dyspnea) or radiological abnormalities occur in the 
absence of a clear  diagnosis, an interruption in study treatment dosing is recommended and further 
diagnostic workup (including a high resolution CT scan) should be performed to exclude pneumonitis.  
Following investigation, if no evidence of abnormality is observed on CT im aging and symptoms 
resolve, then study treatment can be restarted, if deemed appropriate by the investigator. If significant 
pulmonary abnormalities are identified, these need to be discussed with the Study Physician.

  93 (170) 6.7.2.2  Management of nausea and vomiting  
Even ts of nausea and vomiting are known to be associated with olaparib treatment. In study 
D0810C00019 nausea was reported in 71% of the olaparib treated subjects and 36% in the placebo 
treated subjects and vomiting was reported in 34% of the olaparib treated subjects and 14% in the 
placebo treated subjects. These events are generally mild to moderate (CTCAE grade 1 or 2) severity, 
intermittent and manageable on continued treatment. The first onset generally occurs in the first month 
of treatment for nausea and  within the first 6 months of treatment for vomiting. For nausea, the 
incidence generally plateaus at around 9 months, and for vomiting at around 6 to 7 months.  
No routine prophylactic anti -emetic treatment is required at the start of study treatment, howe ver, 
subjects should receive appropriate anti -emetic treatment at the first onset of nausea or vomiting and as 
required thereafter, in accordance with local treatment practice guidelines.  Alternatively, olaparib 
tablets can be taken with a light meal/snac k (i.e., 2 pieces of toast or a couple of biscuits).  
As per international guidance on anti -emetic use in cancer subjects (ESMO, NCCN), generally a single 
agent antiemetic should be considered e.g. , dopamine receptor antagonist, antihistamines or 
dexamethas one. 
6.7.2.3  Interruptions for intercurrent non -toxicity related events  
Study treatment dose interruption for conditions other than toxicity resolution should be kept as short 
as possible. If a subject cannot restart study treatment within 4 weeks for resolution o f intercurrent 
conditions not related to disease progression or toxicity, the case should be discussed with the 
AstraZeneca study physician.  
All dose reductions and interruptions (including any missed doses), and the reasons for the 
reductions/interruption s are to be recorded in the eCRF.  
Study treatment should be stopped at least 3 days prior to planned surgery. After surgery, study 
treatment can be restarted when the wound has healed. No stoppage of study treatment is required for 
any needle biopsy proce dure.  
Study treatment should be discontinued for a minimum of 3 days before a subject undergoes radiation 
treatment. Study treatment should be restarted within 4 weeks as long as any bone marrow toxicity has 
recovered.  
Because the AEs related to olaparib m ay include asthenia, fatigue and dizziness, subjects should be 
advised to use caution while driving or using machinery if these symptoms occur.

  94 (170) 6.8 Management of toxicities related to enzalutamide and abiraterone 
acetate  
Detailed here, as guidance, are approved toxicity management guidelines for abiraterone acetate and 
enzalutamide (US Prescribing Information).  
For toxicity management please adhere to these guidelines or, where appropriate, to local approved or 
clinical practice guidelines.   
6.8.1 Dose adjustment recommendations for enza lutamide  
If subject experiences a ≥ Grade 3 toxicity or an intolerable side effect, interrupt enzalutamide 
treatment for one week or until symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 2, then resume at the same or a reduced 
dose (120 mg or 80 mg), per investigator discreti on. 
6.8.2 Dose adjustment recommendations for abiraterone acetate  
In subjects with baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class B), reduce the dose of 
abiraterone acetate to 250 mg once daily.  Permanently discontinue treatment with abiraterone acetate  
in subjects with baseline moderate hepatic impairment if ALT and/or AST > 5xULN or total bilirubin 
> 3xULN.  
In subjects who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment, i .e., ALT and/or AST > 5xULN or total 
bilirubin > 3xULN, interrupt abiraterone acetate tre atment until values return to subject’s baseline 
value or to AST and ALT ≤2.5xULN and total bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN.  Treatment may be restarted at 
investigator discretion at a reduced dose of 750 mg as first step and 500 mg as second step.  If 
hepatotoxicity recurs at the reduced dose of 500 mg once daily, treatment should be discontinued with 
no further dose reductions.  
Permanently discontinue abiraterone acetate treatment for subjects with concurrent elevation of ALT > 
3xULN and total bilirubin > 2xULN in th e absence of biliary obstruction of other causes responsible 
for the concurrent elevation.  
6.9 Medication error 
If a medication error occurs in the  course of the study, then the i nvestigator or other site personnel 
informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day i.e., immediately but no later than 
24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.  
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all relevant 
information is completed within 1  (Initial Fatal/Life -Threatening or follow up Fatal/Life -Threatening) 
or 5 (other serious initial and follow up) calendar days if there is an SAE associated with the 
medication error (see Section 6.3.1 ) and within 30 days for all other medication errors.  
The definition of a Medication Error can be found in Appendix A. 
6.10 Study governance and oversight  
6.10.1  Steering Committee  
A Steering Committee will be resp onsible for supervising the progress of the trial. This committee will 
include experts in prostate cancer and the Sponsor’s representatives.

  95 (170) 6.10.2  Data Monitoring Committee  
This study will use an external Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) to perform i nterim 
reviews of accumulating study safety data. This committee will be composed of therapeutic area 
experts and a statistician, who are not employed by AstraZeneca, and do not have any major conflict of 
interest. Following the review , the IDMC will recom mend whether the study should continue 
unchanged, be terminated, or be modified in any way. Once the IDMC has reached a recommendation, 
a report will be provided to AstraZeneca. A separate IDMC charter will be developed which will 
contain details of the ID MC members and clearly define the responsibilities of the IDMC.  
7. INVESTIGATIONAL PROD UCT AND OTHER TREATM ENTS  
7.1 Identity of investigational product and comparators  
The AstraZeneca Pharmaceutical Technology and Development R&D Supply Chain will supply 
olaparib. Abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide will be sourced locally or centrally and should be 
administered according to local prescribing information, including any treatment restrictions.  
Abiraterone acetate must be dosed with prednisone in accordance with the approved label 
(prednisolone is permitted for use instead of prednisone if necessary).   
Table 12 Identity of investigational product and comparators

a Descriptive information for olaparib can be found in the olaparib IB.  Manufacturer will be included in the 
quality section of the IMPD.  
b With prednisone  
For all centers, olaparib tablets will be packed in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with ch ild 
resistant closures. Each dosing container will contain sufficient medication for at least each treatment 
period plus overage. Multiple bottles of study treatment will be required for dispensing in order to 
make up the desired dose.  
7.2 Dose and treatment r egimens  
Subjects will be randomized to receive either olaparib or investigator choice of abiraterone acetate or 
enzalutamide in a 2:1 ratio, respectively.  Subjects will continue to receive study treatment until BICR -
assessed radiographic progression, or after the  date of DCO for the primary analysis until 
investigator -assessed radiographic progression, as long as they do not meet any of the criteria for 
treatment discontinuation.   
Olaparib is available as film -coated tablet containing 150 mg or 100 mg of olaparib.  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  96 (170) Subjects will be administered olaparib orally twice daily at 300 mg bid continually.  Two x 150 mg 
olaparib tablets should be taken at the same time each day, approximately 12 hours apart with one 
glass of water.  If required, dose reductions to 250 mg bi d and a further dose reduction to 200 mg bid 
are permitted, however once dose reduced, no return to the higher dose will be allowed.  
The tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, crushed, dissolved or divided. Olaparib tablets 
can be taken with or without food.  On PK sampling days, subjects should fast from 1 hour before 
olaparib dosing to 2 hours after.  
If vomiting occurs shortly after the olaparib tablets are swallowed, the dose should only be replaced if 
all of the intact tablets can be seen and  counted.  Should any subject enrolled on the study miss a 
scheduled dose for whatever reason (e.g., as a result of forgetting to take the tablets or vomiting), the 
subject will be allowed to take the scheduled dose up to a maximum of 2 hours after that sc heduled 
dose time.  If greater than 2 hours after the scheduled dose time, the missed dose is not to be taken and 
the subject should take their allotted dose at the next scheduled time.  
Enzalutamide will be administered orally at 160 mg once daily.   Four x  40 mg  capsules /tablets  should 
be taken a similar time each day.  Capsules /tablets  should be swallowed whole and can be taken with 
or without food, in full accordance with local prescribing information.  
Abiraterone acetate will be administered orally at 1, 000 mg once daily.   Four x 250 mg or two x 
500 mg tablets should be taken at a similar time each day in combination with prednisone 5 mg 
administered orally twice daily (each prednisone dose approximately 12 hours apart). Subjects should 
take abiraterone a cetate doses at a similar time each day. Abiraterone acetate must be taken on an 
empty stomach. No food should be consumed for at least two hours before the dose of abiraterone 
acetate and one hour after the dose of abiraterone acetate. The tablets should be swallowed whole with 
water and not crushed or chewed, in full accordance with local prescribing information.  
Dose Reductions  
For guidance on dose reductions for management of AEs refer to Section 6.7 (for olaparib) and 
Section  6.8 (for enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate) . 
For guidance on dose reductions when concomitant strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors and strong 
CYP2C8 inhibitors (for enzalutamide) cannot be avoi ded see Section 7.7. 
Renal Impairment    
If subsequent to study entry and while still on study therapy, a subject ’s estimated CrCl falls below the 
threshold for study inclusion (≥51 ml/min), retesting should be performed promptly.  
 
A dose reduction is recommended for subjects who develop moderate renal impairment (calculated 
creatinine clearance by Cockcroft -Gault equation of between 31 and 50 ml/min) for any reason during 
the course of the study: the dose of olaparib should be reduced to 200  mg bid.  
 
Because the CrCl determination is only  an estimate of renal function, in instances where the CrCl falls 
to between 31 and 50 mL/min, the investigator should use his or her discretion in determining whether 
a dose change or discontinuation of therapy is warranted.

  97 (170) Olaparib has not been studied  in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance  
≤ 30 ml/min) or end -stage renal disease; if subjects develop severe impairment or end stage disease it 
is recommended that olaparib be discontinued.  
7.3 Labelling  
Labels will be prepared in accord ance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and local regulatory 
guidelines.  The labels will fulfi ll GMP Annex 13 requirements for labelling.  Label text will be 
translated into local language.  
Each bottle/pack of IMP will have an investigational product label permanently affixed to the outside 
stating that the material is for clinical study/investigational use only and should be kept out of reach 
and sight of children. The label will include a space for the enrol lment code (E -code) to be completed 
at the time of dispensing.  
Specific dosing instructions will not be included on the label; the site must complete the ‘Subject 
Dispensing Card’ with the details of the dosing instructions at the time of dispensing.  
The subject emergency contact details will not b e on the label, but can be found in the informed 
consent and the ‘Subject Dispensing Card’.  For emergency purposes, the subject must be in 
possession of the emergency contact details at all times.  
7.4 Storage  
All study drugs should be kept in a secure place u nder appropriate storage conditions.  The 
investigational product label on the bottle specifies the appropriate storage.  
7.5 Compliance  
The administration of all study drugs (including investigational products) should be recorded in the 
appropriate Sections of  the eCRF.  
Subjects should be given clear instructions on how and when to take their study treatment. Subjects 
will self -administer study treatment. Compliance of the first dose and any doses taken on the day of 
any study visit (except for study treatment supply visits) will be assured by supervised administration 
by the Investigator or delegate. Study site staff will make tablet/capsule counts at regular intervals 
during treatment. Compliance will be assessed by the tablet /capsule count and the informatio n will be 
recorded in the appropriate Section of the eCRF. After the tablet/capsule count has been performed, the 
remaining tablets/capsules will not be returned to the subject but will be retained by the Investigative 
site until reconciliation is complete d by the study monitor. All subjects should return their 
bottles/packs of study medication at the appropriate scheduled visit, when new bottles/packs will be 
dispensed. Subjects will be instructed to notify study site personnel of missed doses. Dates of mi ssed 
or held doses will be recorded on the eCRF.  
*Exception: Tablet/capsule counts do not have to be recorded on eCRF for locally supplied drug, but 
all study drug usage, including any missed doses, still needs to be recorded on appropriate section of 
eCRF . 
Subjects must return all containers and any remaining tablets at the end of the study.

  98 (170) 7.6 Accountability  
The study drug provided for this study are for use only as directed in the study protocol.  It is the 
Investigator/institution’s responsibility to estab lish a system for handling study treatments, including 
IPs, so as to ensure that:  
• Deliveries of such products from AstraZeneca or its representative are correctly received by 
a responsible person . 
• Such deliveries are recorded . 
• Study treatments are handled and stored safely and properly as stated on the label . 
• Study treatments are only dispensed to study subjects in accordance with the protocol.  
The study personnel will account for all study drugs dispensed to and returned from the subject.  
At the end of the study, it must be possible to reconcile delivery records with records of usage and 
destroyed/returned stock.  Records of usage should include the identification of the person to whom 
the study treatment was dispensed, the quantity and date of di spensing and unused study treatment 
returned to the Investigator.  This record is in addition to any drug accountability information recorded 
on the eCRF.  Any discrepancies must be accounted for on the appropriate forms.  Certificates of 
delivery and retu rn must be signed, preferably by the Investigator or a pharmacist, and copies retained 
in the Investigator site file.  
Dispensing and accountability records will continue to be collected for as long as subjects continue to 
receive study treatment, although they will not be entered on the database after the database has closed . 
Study site personnel, if applicable, or the AZ monitor  will account for all study drugs received at the 
site, unused study drugs and for appropriate destruction.  Certificates of deliv ery, and destruction 
should be signed.  
7.7 Concomitant and other treatments  
The use of any natural/herbal products or other traditional remedies should be discouraged, but use of 
these products, as well as use of all vitamins, nutritional supplements, and al l other concomitant 
medications must be recorded in the case report form (CRF).  
Medications that may NOT be administered  
No other anti -cancer therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy (except LHRH 
agonist/antagonist which is required during tr eatment phase), biological therapy or other novel agent, 
incl. corticosteroids if given for anti -cancer indication) is to be permitted while the subject is receiving 
study medication.  
Live virus and live bacterial vaccines should not be administered whilst  the subject is receiving study 
medication and during the 30 day follow -up period. An increased risk of infection by the 
administration of live virus and bacterial vaccines has been observed with conventional chemotherapy 
drugs and the effects with olapari b are unknown.

Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  99 (170) Restricted concomitant medications  
Strong or Moderate CYP3A inhibitors  
Known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, boosted protease 
inhibitors, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir)  or moderate CYP3A inhibitors 
(ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil) should not be taken with olaparib.  
If there is no suitable alternative concomitant medication , then the dose of olaparib should be reduced 
for the period of conc omitant administration. The dose reduction of olaparib should be recorded in the 
CRF with the reason documented as concomitant CYP3A inhibitor use.  
• Strong CYP3A inhibitors – reduce the dose of olaparib to 100 mg bid for the duration of 
concomitant therapy  with the strong inhibitor and for 5 half lives afterwards.  
• Moderate CYP3A inhibitors - reduce the dose of olaparib to 150 mg bid for the duration 
of concomitant therapy with the moderate inhibitor and for 3 half lives afterwards.  
• After the washout of the inhibitor is complete, the olaparib dose can be re -escalated.  
Strong or Moderate CYP3A inducers  
Strong (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine, 
enzalutamide and St John’s Wort) and moderate CYP3A i nducers (e .g., bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil) 
of CYP3A should not be taken with olaparib.  
If the use of any strong or moderate CYP3A inducers are considered necessary for the subject ’s safety 
and welfare this could diminish the clinical efficacy of olapar ib. 
If a subject  requires use of a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer then they must be monitored carefully 
for any change in efficacy of olaparib.  
Refer to local prescribing information for guidance on dose modification for abiraterone acetate and 
enzalutam ide in situations where co -administration with strong CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided.  
Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors  
Co-administration of enzalutamide with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors may increase exposure to 
enzalutamide and thus should be avoided if possible.  If subjects must be co -administered a strong 
CYP2C8 inhibitor, reduce the enzalutamide dose to 80 mg once daily (or per local prescribing 
information if different).  If co -administration of the strong inhibitor is discontinued, the enzalutamide 
dose shoul d be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor.  
P-gp inhibitors  
It is possible that co -administration of P -gp inhibitors (e .g., amiodarone, azithromycin) may increase 
exposure to olaparib. Caution should therefore be obse rved.  
Effect of olaparib on other drugs  
Based on limited in vitro  data, olaparib may increase the exposure to substrates of CYP3A4, P -gp, 
OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, OAT3, MATE1 and MATE2K.

Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  100 (170) Based on limited in vitro  data, olaparib may reduce the exposure to subs trates of CYP3A4, 2B6, 2C9, 
2C19 and P -gp.  
Caution should therefore be observed if substrates of these isoenzymes or transporter proteins are co -
administered.  
Examples of substrates include:  
• CYP3A4 – hormonal contraceptive, simvastatin, cisapride, cyclosporine, ergot alkaloids, 
fentanyl, pimozide, sirolimus, tacrolimus and quetiapine  
• CYP2B6 – bupropion, efavirenz  
• CYP2C9 – warfarin  
• CYP2C19 - lansoprazole, omeprazole, S -mephenytoin  
• P-gp - simvastatin, pravastatin, digoxin, dabigatran, colc hicine  
• OATP1B1 - bosentan, glibenclamide, repaglinide, statins and valsartan  
• OCT1, MATE1, MATE2K – metformin  
• OCT2  - serum creatinine  
• OAT3 -furosemide, methotrexate  
Anticoagulant Therapy  
Subjects who are taking warfarin may participate in this trial; howeve r, it is recommended that 
international normali zed ratio (INR) be monitored carefully at least once per week for the first month, 
then monthly if the INR is stable. Subcutaneous heparin and low molecular weight heparin are 
permitted.  
Anti -emetics/Anti -diarrheals  
From screening part 2 onwards, should a subject develop nausea, vomiting and / or diarrhea, then these 
symptoms should be reported as AEs (see Section 6.3) and appropriate treatment of the event given.  
Palliative radiotherapy  
Palliative radiotherapy may be used for the treatment of pain at the site of bony metastases that were 
present at baseline, provided the investigator does not feel that these are indicative of clinical disease 
progression during the study period.  Olaparib  should be discontinued for a minimum of 3 days before 
a subject undergoes therapeutic palliative radiation treatment.  Olaparib should be restarted within 4 
weeks as long as any bone marrow toxicity has recovered.

  101 (170) Administration of other anti -cancer age nts 
Continuous androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with an LHRH agonist/antagonist (unless bilateral 
orchiectomy) must be continued during the trial. Since LHRH is standard of care, it will not be 
provided nor reimbursed.  
Subjects must not receive any othe r concurrent anti -cancer therapy, including investigational agents, 
while on study treatment. Subjects may continue the use of bisphosphonates or denosumab for bone 
disease provided the dose is stable before and during the study and they were started at le ast 4 weeks 
prior to beginning study treatment.  
Subsequent therapies for cancer  
Details of first and subsequent therapies for cancer and/or details of surgery for the treatment of the 
cancer, after discontinuation of treatment, will be collected.  Reasons  for starting subsequent anti -
cancer therapies including access to other PARP inhibitors or investigational drugs will be collected 
and included in the exploratory assessments of OS.  
7.7.1 Other concomitant treatment  
Other medication other than that described ab ove, which is considered necessary for the subject’s 
safety and well -being, may be given at the discretion of the Investigator and recorded in the 
appropriate Sections of the eCRF.  
In addition, any unplanned diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedure pe rformed during the study 
period must be recorded in the eCRF.  
8. STATISTICAL ANALYSES  BY ASTRAZENECA  
8.1 Statistical considerations  
• All personnel involved with the analysis of the study will remain blinded  at aggregate  
level  until database lock and protocol violations identified.  Prior to the database lock, any 
analysis tasks being performed will use a dummy random scheme.  
• Analyses will be performed by AstraZeneca or its representatives.  
A comprehensive Statistical Analysis P lan (SAP) will be prepared prior to first subject randomized and 
any subsequent amendments will be documented, with final amendments completed prior to 
unblinding of the data.  
8.2 Sample size estimate  
The sample size of 240 subjects randomized in a 2:1 ratio to olaparib tablets (300 mg orally bid) versus 
predeclared investigator choice of either enzalutamide (160 mg orally od) or abiraterone acetate 
(1,000  mg orally od with 5 mg bid prednisone) in Cohort A of this study was selected to be consistent 
with the research hypothesis as described in Section 1.1.2 . The primary endpoint of the study is rPFS.  
It is expected that the targeted sample size of 2 40 subjects in Cohort A with approximately 143 rPFS 
events (60% maturity) will provide 95% power to demonstrate a statistical significant difference in 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  102 (170) rPFS at a 2 -sided alpha level of 5% assuming true treatment effect was a HR=0.53. This translates to 
an approximately 4. 5-month improvement in median rPFS over an assumed 5 -month median rPFS on 
enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate assuming rPFS is exponentially distributed. The smallest treatment 
difference that would be statistically significant at the final  analysis is a HR of 0.71. It is anticipated 
that the study accrual period will be approximately 28 months and that 143 progression and death 
events will occur approximately 35 months after the first subject is randomized in the study.  
Cohort B of the stu dy will consist of approximately 100 subjects with qualifying HRR mutations other 
than BRCA1 , BRCA2  and ATM . These subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to olaparib tablets 
versus predeclared investigator choice of either enzalutamide or abiraterone a cetate.  
8.3 Definitions of analysis sets  
8.3.1 Efficacy analysis set  
Cohort A Full Analysis Set (FAS):  
The primary statistical  analysis  of the efficacy  of olaparib  in comparison to investigator choice of either 
enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate in Cohort A will inclu de all subjects  who randomized in Cohort A as 
part of the global enrol lment regardle ss of the treatment actually received. The global recruitment to the

8.4 Outcome measures for analyses  
8.4.1 Primary Endpoints  
8.4.1.1  Radiological Progression Free Survival (rPFS)  
Progres sion-free survi val is defined  as the  time from  rando mization  until the date of objective  disease  
progression (see Section 5.1.1.1  and Table 6) or death  (by any  cause in the absence  of pr ogressio n) 
regardless of whether the subject withdraws from randomized therapy or receives another anti -cancer 
therapy prior to progression. Subjects  who have  not progressed (defined  as CR,  PR or SD by RECIST  
1.1 for soft tissue disease, or non -PD for bone disease, see Section 5.1.2  and Appendix E)  at the time 
of analysis  will be censored  at the time of the  latest  date of their last evaluable RECIST assessment or 
bone scan.  However, if  the subject  progresses or dies  after 2 or more  missed radiologic assessments,  
the subject  will be censored  at the time of the latest evaluable RECIST 1.1 or bone scan assess ment 
prior to the two missed visits. If the  subject  has no evaluable  visits  or does not  have baseline  data they 
will be censored  at Day 1 unless  they die within  2 visits of baseline  (in which  case their date of death  
will be used).  
The rPFS ti me will always be derived based  on scan/assess ment dates  not visit dates.  
When  the Investigator  is in doubt  as to whether  PD has occurred  and therefore  reassesses the subject  at 
a later date,  the date of the  initial  scan should  be declared as the  date of progression if  the repeat  scans 
confirm  progression.  
CT/MRI and bone scans  contr ibuting  towards a  particular  visit may be per formed on di fferent  dates. 
The following  rules will be applied: 
• For BICR (RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3) assessments, the date of progression will be 
determined based on the earliest of the scan dates of the component that triggered the 
progression for the adjudicated reviewer selecting PD or of the reviewer who read 
baseline f irst if there is no adjudication for ICR data.  
• For investigator assessments, the date  of progression will  be deter mined based on the  
earliest  of the  dates  of the co mponent  that triggered  the progression  
• For BICR and investigator assessments, when  censoring  a subject  for rPFS, the  subject  
will be censored at the latest  of the dates  contributing  to a particular  overall  visit 
assess ment.

Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  105 (170) The primary analysis will be based on the blinded independent central review (BICR) of the 
radiological scans. There is no plan for BICR to read any scans dated after the date of DCO for the 
primary analysis. There will be no need to request confirmation o f BICR PD after this time point, and 
the investigator -assessed radiographic progression will prevail.  
A charter 
for the BI CR will be developed in advance of the start of study. A sensitivity analysis based on the 
programmatically derived rPFS based on investigator recorded assessments will be performed.  
8.4.2 Secondary Endpoints  
8.4.2.1  Confirmed Overall Objective Response Rate (ORR)  
For t he secondary endpoint ORR assessed by BICR (RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3), only  subjects  with 
measurable  disease  (target  lesions)  at entry will  be included in the analysis . A responder  will be any 
subject  with a confirmed best overall response of PR or CR in  their soft tissue  disease  assessed  by 
RECIST  1.1, in the absence of progression on bone scan assessed by PCWG3. A subject will be 
classified as a responder if the RECIST 1.1 criteria for a CR or PR are satisfied (as well as the absence 
of confirmed progression on bone scan assessed by PCWG3) at any t ime up to and including the 
defined analysis cut -off point. For each treatment group, the objective response rate (ORR) is the 
number of subjects with a CR and PR divided by the number of subjects in the treatment group in the 
FAS with measurable disease a t baseline.  
 
ORR will also be defined on the basis of RECIST only (soft tissue disease only). Additionally, 
analyses will also be performed on ORR assessed by investigator.  
8.4.2.2  Time to Pain Progression  
Time to pain progression is defined as time from randomiz ation to time point at which worsening in 
pain is observed for asymptomatic subjects and symptomatic subjects (at baseline) as follows:  
Asymptomatic subjects at baseline (average BPI -SF Item 3 score of 0 and not taking opioids)  
• Increase of 2 or more points  in the average (i.e. , average of 7 -day assessments) “worst 
pain in 24 hours” (BPI -SF item 3) from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow -up 
assessments/visits (separated by 3 -4 weeks)  
Or 
• Initiation of opioid use for pain  
Symptomatic subjects at baseli ne (average BPI -SF Item 3 score >0 and/or currently taking opioids)  
• Increase of 2 or more points in the average (i.e. , average of 7 -day assessments) “worst 
pain in 24 hours” (BPI -SF item 3) from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow -up 
assessments/visi ts (separated by 3 -4 weeks) and an average worst pain score ≥4, and no 
decrease in average (i.e. , average of 7 -day assessments) opioid use measured as 1 or more 
points decrease in AQA score from a starting value of 2 or higher  
Or 

Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  106 (170) • Increase in the average ( i.e., average of 7 -day assessments) opioid use measured as 1 or 
more points increase (or at least 2 points increase if the starting value is 0) in the AQA 
score from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow -up assessments/visits (separated by 
3-4 weeks)  
Subjects satisfying one or more of the criteria above will be considered to have pain progression. 
Subjects who do not satisfy any of the criteria above will be censored at the time of the last known 
assessment that showed an absence of pain progression.  
Details on the BPI -SF and Analgesic score are provided in Sections 5.3.1.1  and 5.3.1.5 , respectively.  
8.4.2.3  Overall Survival  
Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause 
regardl ess of whether the subject withdraws from randomized therapy or receives another anti -cancer 
therapy. Any subject not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last 
recorded date on which the subject was known to be alive. No te: Survival calls will be made in the 
week following the date of DCO for the analysis, and if subjects are confirmed to be alive or if the 
death date is post the DCO date these subjects will be censored at the date of DCO. See Section 3.10.2  
for methods that can be used to determine status of subjects who withdraw consent or are lost to follow 
up. 
8.4.2.4  Time to first Symptomatic Skeletal –Related Event (SS RE)  
Time from randomization to first symptomatic skeletal –related event as defined by any of the 
following or a combination:  
• Use of radiation therapy to prevent or relieve skeletal symptoms . 
• Occurrence of new symptomatic pathological bone fractures (vertebral or non -vertebral). 
Radiologic documentation is required . 
• Occurrence of spinal cord compression. Radiologic documentation required . 
• Orthopedic surgical intervention for bone metastasis . 
Subjects who have not experienced any of the above  conditions will be censored at time of death, or 
time of analysis if the subject is living.  
8.4.2.5  Duration of Response  
Duration of response (DOR) will be defined as the time from the date of first documented confirmed 
response (by BICR using RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3) until date of documented progression (by BICR) 
or death in the absence of disease progression.  
The end of response should coincide with the date of progression or death from any cause used for the 
PFS endpoint. The time of the initial response will be defined as the latest of the dates contributing 
towards the first visit response of PR or CR. If a subject does not progress following a response, then 
their duration of response will use the PFS censoring date as the date at which that subject is censo red 
for DOR. The time to response is the time from randomization to the first onset of an objective tumor 
response.

  107 (170) 8.4.2.6  Time to Opiate Use for Cancer Pain  
Time to Opiate use is defined as the time from randomization to the date of opiate use for cancer -
related  pain on subjects who have not received any opiates at baseline. Subjects who have not received 
opiates during the study or died prior to receiving opiates will be considered censored at the last known 
on study date of no opiate use.  
8.4.2.7  Prostate Specific Ant igen (PSA) Response  
PSA response is defined as the proportion of subjects achieving a ≥50% decrease in PSA from baseline 
to the lowest post -baseline PSA result, confirmed by a second consecutive PSA assessment at least 3 
weeks later  
• A subject will be regar ded as having a single PSA visit response if their PSA level at any post -
dose visit is reduced by 50% or more compared with baseline . 
• A subject will be regarded as having a confirmed PSA response if they have a reduction in 
PSA level of 50% or more compare d with baseline that is confirmed at the next assessment at 
least 3 weeks later (i.e., decrease relative to baseline of at least 50% documented on 2 
consecutive occasions at least 3 weeks apart).  
8.4.2.8  Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) Conversion rate  
Defined as the  proportion of subjects achieving a decline in the number of CTCs from ≥5 cells/7.5 mL 
at baseline to <5 cells/7.5 mL post baseline.   
8.4.2.9  Time from randomization to second progression or death (PFS2)  
Defined as the time from the date of randomization to the e arliest of the investigator assessed 
progression event (subsequent to that used for the primary variable PFS) or death.  
8.4.2.10  Pain Severity  
The BPI -SF pain severity domain/subscale consists of 4 items (#3, #4, #5, and #6) that assess pain at 
its “worst,” “least, ” “average,” and “now” (current pain) respectively on an 11 -point numeric rating 
scale (NRS). A pain severity subscale or composite score from all the 4 items (a mean score) will be 
evaluated as time to ‘pain severity’ progression and assessed from the tim e of randomization as 
follows for asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects:  
Asymptomatic subjects at baseline (average “pain severity” subscale score of 0 and not taking 
opioids)  
• Increase of ≥ 2 points in the average “pain severity” subscale score from baseli ne observed at 
2 consecutive follow -up assessments/visits (separated by 3 -4 weeks)  
Or 
• Initiation of opioid use for pain . 
Symptomatic subjects at baseline (average “pain severity” subscale score >0 and/or currently taking 
opioids)

Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  108 (170) • Increase of ≥ 2 points in the average “pain severity” subscale score from baseline observed at 
2 consecutive follow -up assessments/visits (separated by 3 -4 weeks) and an average “pain 
severity” subscale score ≥4, and no decrease in average opioid use measured as 1 or more 
points de crease in AQA score from a starting value of 2 or higher   
Or 
• Increase in the average (i.e. , average of 7 -day assessments) opioid use measured as 1 or more 
points increase (or at least 2 points increase if the starting value is 0) in the AQA score from 
baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow -up assessments/visits (separated by 3 -4 weeks) .  
8.4.2.11  Pain  Interference  
The BPI -SF pain interference domain includes 7 items: general activity (item #9A), mood (item #9B), 
walking ability (item #9C), normal work (item #9D), relations with other people (item #9E), sleep 
(item #9F), and enjoyment of life (item #9G) . The pain interference domain is scored as the mean of 
the 7 interference items. The mean can be used if more than 50% of the total items, or 4 of 7, have 
been completed on a given administration ( Cleeland 2009 ). Absolute and change from baseline scores 
of pain interference will be evaluated.  
8.4.2.12  FACT -P 
For the FACT -P total score, TOI, FAPSI -6, PCS, PWB, and FWB sub -scales, absolute and change 
from baseline scores for each time point will be calculated for each treatme nt group.  
A best response of ‘Improved’, ‘No Change’ and ‘Worsened’, defined according to Table 14 and Table  
15, will be calculated for each subject for scales assessing prostate cancer symptoms, impact on 
functional well -being etc: FACT -P Total, TOI, FAPSI -6, PCS, PWB, and FWB subscales.  
Table 14 details how responders will be defined for the FACT -P total, TOI, FAPSI -6, PCS, PWB, and 
FWB scores ( Cella et al 2009 ).

8.4.2.13  Pain Palliation  
Pain Palliation is defined for subjects with a BPI-SF “worse pain” item #3 score ≥4 points at baseline 
and is assessed as the proportion of subjects with a decrease of ≥ 2 points in BPI -SF item #3 score at 
12 weeks, confirmed at least 3 weeks later, without a ≥ 1 point increase (or ≥ 2 increase if star ting 
value is 0) in AQA analgesic score.  
8.4.2.14  Pharmacokinetic Endpoints  
Olaparib concentrations in plasma will be measured at Week 4 (Visit 3) pre -dose ( - 30 min ± 15 min) 
and at 30 min ± 15 min, 2 ± 0.5 h, 5 ± 0.5 h, and 8± 1 h postdose.   
8.4.3 Exploratory Endpoints  
8.4.3.1  PRO -CTCAE  
The PRO -CTCAE consists of nominal categories (e.g. , “none” to “very severe” for some items in the 
questionnaire) as described in the Appendix G.  
8.4.3.2  Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)  
The response options of the PGIC are scored as follows: V ery Much Improved (+3), Much Improved 
(+2), Minimally Improved (+1), No Change (0), Minimally Worse ( -1), Much Worse ( -2) and Very 
Much Worse ( -3).  
8.4.3.3  Resource Use  
To investigate the impact of treatment and disease on health care resource, the following vari ables will 
be captured:  
• Planned and unplanned hospital attendances beyond trial protocol mandated visits 
(including physician visits, emergency room visits, day cases and admissions)  
• Primary sign or symptom the subject presents with  
• Length of hospital stay  
• Length of any time spent in an intensive care unit (ICU) .  
8.4.3.4  EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D-5L index comprises 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self -care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). For each dimension, respondents select which statement best 
describes their health on that day from a possible 5 options of increasing levels of severity (no 
problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and unable to/ extreme problems). A 
unique EQ -5D health state is referred to by a 5 -digit code allowing for a total of 3125 health states. For 
Clinical Study Protocol

Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  111 (170) example, state 11111 indicates no problems on any of the 5 dimensions. These data will be converted 
into a weighted health state  index by applying scores from EQ -5D value sets elicited from general 
population samples (the base case will be the UK valuation set, with other country value sets applied in 
scenario analyses). Where values sets are not available, the EQ -5D-5L to EQ -5D-3L crosswalk will be 
applied. In addition to the descriptive system, respondents also assess their health today on a visual 
analogue scale, ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health).  
8.4.4 Safety Endpoints  
Safety and tolerability wil l be assessed in terms of physical examination, AEs, deaths, laboratory data 
and vital signs.  These will be collected for all subjects.   
8.4.4.1  Adverse Events  
An AE is the appearance of or worsening of any pre -existing condition, undesirable sign(s), 
symptom(s) , or medical condition(s) occurring after signing the informed consent. All AEs will be 
coded using the MedDRA® dictionary to provide the system organ class and preferred term for each 
AE.  AEs will be grouped separately as AE onset before and after first dose of study drug.  
Any AE commencing (or worsening) on the same day as the first dose of study treatment, will be 
assumed to occur after study treatment has been administered. A treatment emergent AE (TEAE) will 
therefore be defined as an AE with the star t date on or after the first dose date, and up to and including 
the 30 -day (±7 days) follow -up visit after discontinuation of study treatment.  
8.4.4.2  Other significant Adverse Events (OAE)  
During the evaluation of the AE data, an AstraZeneca or designated CRO med ically qualified expert 
will review the list of AEs that were not reported as SAEs and DAEs.  Based on the expert’s 
judgement, significant adverse events of particular clinical importance may, after consultation with the 
Global Subject Safety Physician, be  considered OAEs and reported as such in the Clinical Study 
Report.  A similar review of laboratory/vital signs/ECG data will be performed for identification of 
OAEs.  
Examples of these are marked hematological and other laboratory abnormalities, and certai n events 
that lead to intervention (other than those already classified as serious), dose reduction or significant 
additional treatment.  
8.4.4.3  Concomitant medications  
Concomitant medications will be classified according to the current version of the WHO Drug 
Dictionary.  
Concomitant medications will be classed as either:  
1. Concomitant medications starting prior to first dose (pre -study)  
2. Concomitant medications starting on or after first dose date (on study). Medications that start 
on the same day as the first dose of study treatment will be assumed to occur after study 
treatment has been administered, and be classified as on -study.

Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  112 (170) 8.4.4.4  Compliance and exposure  
Study drug exposure (days) will be defined as time from first dose of olaparib to last dose. Exposure to 
investigator choice  will be calculated in the same way.  
Exposure will be defined as:  
Last dose date – first dose date + 1.  
If the last dose date is unknown, the soonest available date afterwards where it is confirmed that no 
drug is being taken will be used instead.  
Percentage compliance will be defined as:  
{(No. tablets dispensed in period – no. tablets returned from period)/ (no. days of study drug exposure 
in period * expected tablets per day)} * 100%  
Where expected tablets per day will take into account o nce daily or bid dosing.  
Overall compliance may be calculated over various periods if the dose has been modified, to take into 
account the differing expected tablets per day or the protocol -specified dose interruptions. Missed 
doses will not be adjusted fo r; the overall compliance will be reduced.  
8.5 Methods for statistical analyses  
A comprehensive SAP will be prepared before first subject randomized. For qualitative variables, the 
population size (N for sample size and n for available data) and the percentage (of available data) for 
each class of the variable will be presented. Quantitative variables will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics, including n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum values. Where 
appropriate, assessments will be summ arized by visit.  
The number of subjects who were screened, randomized to treatment (either Cohort A or Cohort B), 
received treatment and completed the study will be produced for each of the Cohorts and treatment 
groups using the full analysis set. A summar y table of analysis sets will be produced. Demographic 
and baseline characteristics will be summarized using the full analysis set, for Cohorts A and B of the 
study, respectively.  
In general, missing data will not be imputed. For the date variables of hist orical data (i.e., any data 
referring to the period prior to the informed consent date), if the year is missing then the value will not 
be imputed. If the month or day is missing, the value will be imputed: month will be imputed with 
June; day will be impu ted as 15th.  
The treatment comparison is olaparib versus investigator choice. Results of statistical analyses will be 
presented using corresponding 2 -sided confidence intervals and 2 -sided p -values, where appropriate.  
8.5.1 Multiplicity Strategy for Primary End point and Key Secondary endpoints  
rPFS (Cohort A) is considered the primary endpoint in the study.  
Upon achieving statistical significance on the primary endpoint rPFS in Cohort A, testing of each of 
the secondary endpoints, ORR (Cohort A), rPFS (Cohort A + B), time to pain progression (Cohort A),

8.5.2 Analysis of the primary variable(s)  
8.5.2.1  Radiological Progression Free Survival   
The primary analysis of rPFS will be performed when approximately 143 progression and death events 
(60% maturity) in cohort A ha ve occurred based on BICR (RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3) assessment. This 
will be considered the primary rPFS analysis.  
rPFS will be analyzed using a log rank test stratified by previous taxane (yes, no) and measurable 
disease (yes, no) [when analyzing rPFS in Co hort A+B as part of a secondary analysis, an additional 
stratum for cohort will be used if sufficient events exist within strata] and a corresponding p -value will 
be generated. If there are less than 5 rPFS events within each stratum, then the levels of st rata will be 
collapsed until the minimum 5 event criterion is achieved for the primary rPFS endpoint. All analyses 
in Cohort A, B and A+B (secondary analyses) will be conducted in accordance with the corresponding 
final pooling strategy. Further details of  the pre -defined pooling strategy indicating the order in which 
the levels of stratum will be collapsed will be documented in the SAP. The hazard ratio (HR) and 
confidence interval will be estimated using a Cox Proportional Hazards Model (with ties=Efron a nd 
the stratification variables as covariates) and the 2 -sided CI will be calculated using a profile likelihood

  114 (170) approach. Stratification variables will be defined according to data from the interactive voice/web 
response system (IVRS/IWRS).  
The HR (olapari b vs. investigator choice) together with its corresponding 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) and p -value will be presented (a HR less than 1 will favor olaparib).  
Any subjects mis -stratified in the IVRS/IWRS will be included in the stratified log rank test us ing the 
baseline data collected in the IVRS/IWRS.  
A Kaplan -Meier (KM) plot of rPFS will be presented by treatment group. Summaries of the number 
and percentage of subjects experiencing a progression or death event, and the type of event (RECIST 
1.1 or bone  progression or death) will be provided along with median rPFS for each treatment arm.  
The assumption of proportionality will be assessed. Note that in the presence of non -proportionality, 
the HR will be interpreted as an average HR over the observed extent of follow -up.  Proportionality 
will be tested firstly by producing plots of complementary log -log (event times) versus log (time) and, 
if these raise concerns, a time dependent covariate would be fitted to assess the extent to which this 
represents random variation.   
The primary analysis will be based on the BICR assessment of rPFS using all scans reg ardless of 
whether they were scheduled or not.  
The estimated rPFS rates at 6 months and 12 months will be summarized (using the KM curve) and 
presented by treatment group.  
Additionally, the rPFS endpoint will be analyzed in Cohort B and Cohort A+B as part  of secondary 
analyses.  
8.5.3 Analysis of the secondary variable(s)  
Analyses of secondary endpoints will be performed at the time of the primary rPFS analysis including 
an interim analysis for OS. The final analysis of OS will occur upon achieving ~60% maturity in 
Cohort A.  
All time to event analyses in Cohort A, B and A+B will be conducted in accordance with the final 
pooling strategy for stratification factors in the primary analysis of rPFS as indicated in Section 8.5.2  
where less than 5 events for a time to event endpoint within each stratum, will result in collapsing of 
strata until the minimum 5 event criterion is achieved.  Unstratified analyses will  be conducted for any 
secondary endpoints that still do not conform to the 5 event rule per stratum. This will also be 
supported by unstratified sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint.  Additional sensitivity analyses 
may also be conducted as require d.  Further details of the pre -defined pooling strategy indicating the 
order in which the levels of stratum will be collapsed will be documented in the SAP.  
8.5.3.1  Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR)  
ORR will be assessed based on BICR assessed RECIST and bone  scan data (using all scans regardless 
of whether they were scheduled or not) in subjects with measurable disease in FAS. ORR will be 
compared between olaparib and investigator choice using a logistic regression model adjusting for the 
stratification varia ble, previous taxane (yes, no).  The results of the analysis will be presented in terms 
of an odds ratio (an odds ratio greater than 1 will favor olaparib) together with its associated profile 
likelihood 95% CI ( e.g., using the option ‘LRCI’ in SAS procedu re GENMOD) and p -value (based on

  115 (170) twice the change in log -likelihood resulting from the addition of a treatment factor to the model). 
Statistically significant difference in ORR will be demonstrated using a 2 -sided 5% alpha level based 
on the multiplicity s trategy described in section 8.5.1.    
If there are not enough responses for a meaningful analysis using logistic regression then a Fisher’s 
exact test using mid p -values will be presented. The mid -p-value modification of the Fisher exact test 
amounts to s ubtracting half of the probability of the observed table from Fisher's p -value.  
Fisher’s exact test mid p -value  =  Two sided p -value  -  Table probability  
2 
Summaries will be produced that present the number and percentage of subjects with a tumor response 
(CR/PR) per BICR and investigator assessment.  
For each treatment arm, best objective response (BoR) will be summarized by n (%) for each category 
(CR, PR, SD, PD and NE).  No formal statistical analyses are planned for BoR.  
Analysis of ORR will be performed in Cohorts A, B and A+B.  
8.5.3.2  Time to Pain Progression:  
Time to pain progression will be analyzed at the time of the primary rPFS analysis using the same 
methods as in the analysis of rPFS. The p -value will be based on the stratified log rank test using 
previous taxane use and measurable disease as strata and HR and 95% CI will be based on the Cox 
model. A 2 -sided 5% alpha level will be used to test time to  pain progression based on multiplicity 
strategy.  
A Kaplan -Meier (KM) plot of time to pain progression will be presented by treatment group. 
Summaries of the number and percentage of subjects experiencing pain progression will be provided 
along with median  time to pain progression for each treatment arm.  
Analysis of Pain progression will be performed in Cohorts A, B and A+B.  
8.5.3.3  Overall Survival  
Analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoint OS, as defined in Section 8.4.2.3 , will be performed at the 
time of the primary analysis of rPFS with approximately 49% maturity in Cohort A (approximately 
117 events) expected at this point in time and will be considered an interim OS analys is. As per the 
multiplicity strategy described in Section 8.5.1 , testing of the OS endpoint will utilize the alpha level 
recycled from rPFS primary  endpoint and the secondary endpoints ORR (Cohort A), rPFS (Cohort 
A+B), and time to pain progression (Cohort A) using a 2 -sided 5% alpha spend. Using an O’Brien -
Fleming spending function, the interim analysis will use approximately 0.012 alpha level with 80% 
information fraction and a final OS analysis will use as alpha level of 0.021 with approximately 146 
events (61% maturity) estimated to occur approximately 48 months after first subject randomized in 
the study. The p -value will be based on the stratifi ed log rank test using previous taxane use and 
measurable disease as strata. HR and 95% CI will be based on the Cox model.  
A Kaplan -Meier (KM) plot of OS will be presented by treatment group. Summaries of the number and 
percentage of deaths and those alive  and censored will be provided along with median time to death for 
each treatment arm.

  116 (170) OS analysis will be repeated in Cohorts B and Cohort A+B using a 2 -sided alpha level.  
Exploratory  analyses  of OS in Cohort A adjusting  for impact of subsequent  PARP inhibitor  trial or 
treatment (or other  potentially active investiga tional  agents)  may be performed if a sufficient proportion  
of subjects  switch.  Methods such as Rank  Preserving  Structural  Failure  Time (RPSFT)  (Robins et al 
1991 ), Inverse  Probability  of Censoring  Weighting  (Robins 1993 ) and other  methods  in devel opment 
will be explored.  The decision to adjust and final choice  of methods  will be based  on a blinded  review  
of the data and the plausi bility of the  underlying assu mptions.  Details  will be pre-specifi ed in the SAP 
and Payer analysis  plan.  
8.5.3.4  Time to first Symptomatic Skeletal -Related Event (SSRE)  
Time to SSRE will be analyzed using the same methods as in the analysis of the primary endpoint 
rPFS.  
A Kaplan -Meier (KM) plot of time to SSRE will be presented by treatment group. Summaries of the 
number and percentage of subjects with symptomatic skeletal related events and those who are 
censo red will be provided along with median time to symptomatic skeletal related events for each 
treatment arm.  
8.5.3.5  Duration of Response:  
Descriptive data will be provided for the duration of response in responding subjects, including the 
associated Kaplan -Meier cu rves (without any formal comparison of or p -value attached).  
8.5.3.6  Time to Opiate use for Cancer related Pain  
Time to opiate use will be analyzed at the time of the primary rPFS analysis using the same methods as 
in the analysis of rPFS. The, p -value will be based on the stratified log rank test using previous taxane 
use and measurable disease as strata and HR and 95% CI will be based on the Cox model. A 2 -sided 
5% alpha level will be used to test time to opiate use based on multiplicity strategy.  
A Kaplan -Meier (KM) plot of time to opiate use will be presented by treatment group. Summaries of 
the number and percentage of subjects using opiates will be provided along with median time to opiate 
use for each treatment arm.  
8.5.3.7  Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response  
Proportion of subjects achieving a PSA response and subjects with a confirmed PSA response will be 
presented with 95% CIs. Best PSA percentage change from baseline and percentage change at 12 
weeks will be summarized as continuous variables using descriptive statistics and will be graphically 
displayed using waterfall plots.  
8.5.3.8  Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) conversion rate  
Proportion  of subjects  achieving  a CTC conv ersion  will be presented  with 95% CIs. Cha nge from

Time from randomization to second progression or death will be analyzed using the same methods as 
in the analysis of the primary endpoint rPFS. The HR and corresponding 95% confidence interval will 
be based on the Cox model using previous taxane use and me asurable disease as strata.  
A Kaplan -Meier (KM) plot of time to second progression or death will be presented by treatment 
group. Summaries of the number and percentage of subjects with second progression or death and 
those who are censored will be provid ed along with median time to second progression or death for 
each treatment arm.  
8.5.3.10  PK Analysis  
The PK analysis of the plasma concentration data for olaparib will be performed at AstraZeneca 
Research & Development or by a clinical research organization iden tified by AstraZeneca Research & 
Development. The actual sampling times will be used in the PK calculations. For each subject 
providing a complete set of PK samples, non -linear mixed effects modeling will be used to estimate 
steady state maximum observed p lasma concentration, AUC, and minimum observed plasma 
concentration.  
The plasma concentration -time data will be analyzed by non -linear mixed effects modeling in order to 
evaluate the PK characteristics of olaparib, quantify variability in the PK, identify demographic or 
pathophysiological covariates which may explain the observed variability and explore exposure -
response relationships. The relationship between exposure to olaparib and pharmacodynamics response 
(safety and/or efficacy) will be investigated i f deemed appropriate. The population 
PK/pharmacodynamic modeling will be reported separately from the CSR.  
The plasma concentration data will be listed within the clinical study report and the pre -dose and post -
dose olaparib plasma concentrations will be s ummarized, using summary statistics, as detailed in the 
statistical analysis plan.  
8.5.4 Subgroup analysis  
Subgroup analyses will be conducted for rPFS endpoint in Cohort A. The purpose of the subgroup 
analyses is to assess the consistency of treatment effect a cross potential or expected prognostic factors.  
If there are too few responders or events available for a meaningful analysis of a particular subgroup (it 
is not considered appropriate to present analyses where there are less than 5 events in a subgroup),  the 
relationship between that subgroup and the endpoint will not be formally analyzed.  In this case, only 
descriptive summaries will be provided.  
The following subgroups of the full analysis set in Cohort A will be analyzed for rPFS for stratification 
factors  
• Previous taxane use (yes, no)  
• Measurable disease at baseline (yes, no)  
Values collected on the eCRF will be used to define subgroups for stratification factors.  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  118 (170) Additional subgroups of interest include:  
• HRR  mutation type, e.g. , BRCA1, BRCA2 , BRCA1 an d BRCA2  (both), ATM   
• Germline versus somatic mutation type  
• Visceral disease at baseline (yes, no)  
• ECOG performance status at baseline (0, 1, or 2) . 
Other baseline variables may also be assessed if there is clinical justification.  
Additionally, time to pain progression will be assessed in the subgroup of subjects who have not taken 
any analgesics at baseline.  
In each subgroup, the HRs for radiological progression by BICR (olaparib: investigator choice) and 
associated 2 -sided CIs wi ll be calculated from a Cox proportional hazards model (ties = Efron) that 
contains the treatment term, factor and treatment -by-factor interaction term.  The treatment effect HRs 
for each treatment comparison along with their confidence intervals will be o btained for each level of 
the subgroup from this single model.  The HRs and 95% CIs will be presented on a forest plot 
including the HR and 95% CI from the overall population (using the primary analysis).   
No adjustment to the significance level for testi ng of subgroups will be made since all these subgroup 
analyses will be considered exploratory and may only be supportive of the primary analysis of rPFS.  
The presence of quantitative interactions will be assessed by means of an overall global interaction 
test.  This will be performed in the overall population by comparing the fit of a Cox proportional 
hazards model including treatment, all covariates (stratification factors), and all covariate -by-treatment 
interaction terms, with one that excludes the inter action terms and will be assessed at the 2 -sided 10% 
significance level. If the fit of the model is not significantly improved then it will be concluded that 
overall the treatment effect is consistent across the subgroups.  
If the global interaction test is  found to be statistically significant, an attempt to determine the cause 
and type of interaction will be made. Stepwise backwards selection will be performed on the saturated 
model, whereby (using a 10% level throughout) the least significant interaction terms are removed 
one-by-one and any newly significant interactions re -included until a final model is reached where all 
included interactions are significant and all excluded interactions are non -significant.  Throughout this 
process all main effects will  be included in the model regardless of whether the corresponding 
interaction term is still present.  This approach will identify the factors that independently alter the 
treatment effect and prevent identification of multiple correlated interactions.  
Any quantitative interactions identified using this procedure will then be tested to rule out any 
qualitative interaction using the approach of Gail and Simon ( Gail and Simon 1985 ). 
8.5.5 Interim analysis  
An interim analysis of OS will be performed at the time of the primary rPFS analysis in Cohort A 
(approximately 35 months after first subject randomized into the study).  Approximately 117 deaths 
(49% maturit y) are expected to be accrued in Cohort A at the time of interim OS analysis.  Using

Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  119 (170) O’Brien -Fleming spending function an alpha level of 0.012 will be spent at the interim analysis with 
80% information fraction (117/146 events) at the interim OS analysis.  
This study will use an external Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) to perform interim 
reviews of accumulating study safety data. This committee will be composed of therapeutic area 
experts and a statistician, who are not employed by AZ, and do n ot have any major conflicts of 
interest. Following the review, the IDMC will recommend whether the study should continue 
unchanged, be terminated, or be modified in any way. Once the IDMC has reached a recommendation, 
a report will be provided to AstraZene ca. The report will only include the recommendation and any 
potential protocol amendments and it will not contain any unblinded information or reference to the 
confidential considerations of the committee to have led to their recommendation. A separate IDM C 
charter will be developed which will contain details of the IDMC members and clearly define the 
responsibilities of the IDMC.  
In addition to the periodic review of safety data by an IDMC, the safety of all AstraZeneca clinical 
studies is closely monitore d on an on -going basis by AstraZeneca representatives in consultation with 
the Subject Safety Department. Issues identified will be addressed; this could involve, for instance, 
amendments to the study protocol and letters to investigators.  
8.5.6 Sensitivity anal ysis 
8.5.6.1  Sensitivity  analyses for  rPFS  
Sensiti vity analyses  will be performed to assess the possible  presen ce of time-assessment  bias (i.e., 
differential  assess ment times between  treatment  groups).  Summary statistics  for the n umber of weeks 
between  rPFS ti me and the last evaluable  assess ment prior  to progression will  be presented  for each  
treatment group.  
(a) Evaluation -time bias 
Sensiti vity analyses  will be performed to assess possible  evaluatio n-time bias that may be introduced  if 
scans are  not perfor med at the protocol -scheduled  time points.  The midpoint between  the time of 
progression and  the previous evalua ble assessment (RECIST  or PCWG3) will  be analyzed  as des cribed  
for the primary analysis  of rPFS.  This  approach  has be en shown to  be robust to  even  highly  
asymmetric schedules  (Sun and Chen 2010 ). 
(b) Attrition  bias 
Attrition  bias will be assessed by re peating  the primary rPFS analy sis except that the actual rPFS event  
times, rather  than the censored  time, of subjects  who progre ssed or died  in the absence  of progression 
immediately  following  2, or more,  non-evaluable  tumor  assessments will  be included. In addition,  
subjects  who take  subsequent  therapy  prior  to progres sion or death  will be censored  at their last 
evaluable  assess ment prior  to taking  the subsequent therapy.  
(c) Censoring  bias 
A Kaplan -Meier plot of the ti me to censoring will be produced where the censoring indicator of the 
primary rPFS analysis is reversed.  
(d)  Ascertainment bias

  120 (170) Analysis of rPFS will be based on investigator assessment.  
(e)  Sensitivity analysis using unequivocal clinical progression in addition to radiological 
progression  
 
Repeating primary rPFS analysis with the addition of unequivocal progression as an event. W here 
unequivocal clinical progression is defined as, cancer pain requiring initiation of opioids, need to 
initiate cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation therapy or surgical intervention for complications due to 
tumor progression or deterioration in ECOG perfor mance to >= Grade 3.  
(f)  Sensitivity analysis for confirmation of bone progression  
Repeat primary rPFS analysis with revised confirmation criteria for bone progression where bone 
progression accompanied by unequivocal clinical progression does not require  a confirmatory bone 
scan.  
(g)  Sensitivity analysis censoring subjects with subsequent therapy or discontinuation of study 
drug 
Repeat primary rPFS analysis censoring subjects with subsequent therapy or discontinuation of study 
drug prior to progression.   
(h) Sensitivity analysis for enrichment of subjects on Cohort B  
If enrichment on Cohort B (subjects with non BRCA/ATM HRR+ gene mutations) subjects is 
required then a sensitivity  analysis of rPFS in Cohort A+B will be conducted in which a weighted 
estimate of the overall HR (HRcohort A+B ) will be calculated using the estimated HR in Cohort B 
(HRcohort B ), the estimated HR in Cohort A (HRcohort A ) and the estimated HR in HRR+ 
unknown sub group if exists (HR HRR unknown ): 
 
ln(HRcohort A+B) = w1ln(HRcohort A) + w2ln(HRcohort B) + w3ln(HR HRR unknown)  where 
weights w1 , w2 and  w3 (proportion of Cohort A subjects, Cohort B subjects and HRR unknown 
subjects, respective ly) will be estimated fro m the subjects enrolled prior to enrichment occurring (i.e. , 
in the non-enriched portion of the trial).  
 
For calculation of confidence intervals, the overall variance (log scale) will take into account the 
variance of all groups (that are independent), and thus be calculated as:  
 
var(ln(HRcohort A+B)) = w 12var(ln(HRcohort A)) + w22var(ln(HRcohort B)) +  
w32var(ln(HR HRR unknown))  
 
The 100(1 -α) % confidence interval will be calculated as:  
 
exp[ ln(HR cohort A+B) ± Z1 -α/2 √ var(ln(HRcohort A+B))]  
 
The weighted hazard ratio (HR; olaparib: enzalutamide or abiraterone) for tre atment will be estimated 
together with two -sided 95% confidence interval. If there are less than 5 events in the HRR unknown 
subgroup then Cohort A and HRR  unknown group will be combined.

  121 (170) 8.5.7 Supportive analyses  
All exploratory analyses will be performed at the time of the primary rPFS analysis.  
8.5.7.1  Patient  reported  outcomes (PRO)  
The secondary endpoints BPI -SF (Pain Severity domain), BPI -SF (Pain interference domain), Pain 
Palliation, FACT -P (FACT -P Total score, TOI, FWB, PWB, PCS and FAPSI 6 and exploratory 
endpoints), PRO -CTCAE and PGIC are described in Sections 8.4.2  and 8.4.3 . 
PRO endpoints that are continuous in nature (e.g. , BPI-SF, FACT -P, Pain interferenc e) will be 
summarized using means, standard deviation, median and range by treatment group for each visit until 
there are less than one third of subjects with evaluable data. For the FACT -P total score, TOI, FAPSI -
6, PCS, FWB, PWB, BPI -SF item #3 (worst pa in in 24 hours), pain severity (BPI -SF pain severity 
domain), and pain interference, absolute and change from baseline scores for each time point will be 
calculated for each treatment group.  
The proportion of subjects with best responses of ‘Improved’, ‘No  Change’ and “Worsened” on 
FACT -P and subscales (FWB, PWB, PCS, FAPSI 6) scores including TOI will be compared between 
treatments using logistic regression with the same methods and covariates as for the analysis of ORR. 
Responses on the PRO -CTCAE and PGIC  will be summarized descriptively as number of subject and 
corresponding percentages for each category in the questionnaire at each visit by treatment group.  
Time to pain progression will be repeated as a sub -group analysis restricted to subjects who are n on-
opiate users at baseline.  
Time to pain severity progression will be analyzed using the same methodology as in time to pain 
progression without any adjustments for multiplicity. Proportion of subjects with pain palliation will 
be summarized with correspo nding 95% confidence intervals  
Summary measures of overall compliance and compliance over time will be derived separately for 
BPI-SF, FACT -P, PGIC, PRO -CTCAE.  
Overall compliance will be defined as the number of subjects who provided both a baseline and at least 
one post baseline assess ment for which there were sufficient data recorded for the visit to be evaluable 
for at least one subscale, divided by the number of subjects randomized.  
Compliance over time is calculated separately for each visit, including baseline, as the number of 
subjects with an evaluable form at the time point (as defined above), divided by number of subjects 
still expected to complete forms at that visit. Similarly the evaluability rate over time will be calculated 
separately for each visit, including baseline, as  the number of evaluable forms (per definition above), 
divided by the number of received forms.  
Analyses of PRO endpoints will be performed in Cohorts A and A+B.  
8.5.7.2  EQ-5D-5L 
Descriptive  statistics will  be reported  for health  state utility  index  values and  visual  analogue  scale  by 
visits  as well  as change  in these  scores from  baseline.  To support future  econo mic evaluations  of 
olapa rib, additional  appropriate  analyses  may be undertaken,  for exa mple, mean health  state utility  pre-

plan. 
8.5.7.3  Resource Use  
An exploratory  health  econo mic analysis  of the  frequency  of metastatic  prostate  cancer  related 
palliative  interventions,  time to interventions, and reason  for the interventi on will be undertaken.  In 
addition,  length  of stay, ICU use, conco mitant medications  and analgesic  use will  be examined.  
These  analyses will examine the impact  of disease and treatment on resource  use to  primarily support 
the econo mic evaluation  of olaparib  in castrate  resistant  metastatic prostate  cancer.  
8.5.8 Safety Analyses  
Safety  analyses will be presented  using  the Safety  Analysis Set and will be done  by means of 
descri ptive statistics.  Safety profiles will be assessed in terms of AEs, vital  signs (including BP and  
pulse  rate),  laboratory  data (clinical chemistry and hematology),  and physical exa mination.  
Adverse events  will be summarized  separately  for Cohorts A, B and A+B  of the  study and by treatment 
group.  Laboratory  data,  vital signs, physical  examination,  body temperature  and ECG will  be 
summarized  separately  by Cohorts A, B and A+B, Treatment group and Visit.  Summaries will  be 
presented for sc heduled  visits  only.  Any unscheduled  assess ments will be listed. The baseline  value  is 
defined  as the  latest  result  obtained  prior  to the start of IP.  
Additional  tables,  figures,  or listings  may be produced  to aid interpretation. Further  details of 
summaries  of the safety data will be provided  in the SAP.

The number of subjects  experie ncing AEs following  administration  of ola parib and investigator choice  
of enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate as well  as the nu mber of AEs experie nced will be summarized.  
Adverse e vents will be classified using the MedDRA® system  of no menclature  (preferred  term and 
system  organ  class  [SOC]).  Adverse events  reported before administration of olaparib  will be listed 
only and be referred to as ‘pre -treatment.’ 
Similarly,  the number of subjects  experiencing  SAEs, OAEs, AEs that  led to withdrawal,  AEs that  led 
to death and treatment-related AEs with corresponding number of such events  will be summarized by 
Cohort A, B and Cohort A+B and treatment,  as applicable.  
8.5.8.2  Dose -limiting  toxicities  
Dose -limiting toxicities will be summarized  by treat ment cohort and treatment . 
8.5.8.3  Laboratory  data  
Laboratory  data (clinical  chemistry and hematology)  will be summarized.  Shift tabl es will be provided  
for sel ect tests,  where  shift from baseline  to the worst value within the study  will be summarized.  
Laboratory  data outside  the reference ranges  will be indicated.

8.5.8.5  Vital  signs  
Vital  signs, including  BP (mmHg),  body te mperature  (°C) and weight (kg), will  be summarized  at 
baseline.  The baseline  value  is the  last pre-dose assessment. 
8.5.8.6  Other  safety variables  
The remaining  safety  variables  will be presented  using  summary  statistics  for quantitative  data and  
frequency  counts  for qualitative  parameters.  
8.5.8.7  Exposure and compli ance 
Listings  and summaries  of exposure  and compliance  will be produced  for olaparib  and investigator

Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  124 (170) 9. STUDY AND DATA MANAG EMENT BY ASTRAZENECA  
9.1 Training of study site personnel  
Before the first subject is entered into the study, an AstraZeneca representative will review and discuss 
the requirements of the Clinical Study Protocol and related documents with the investigational staff 
and also train them in any study specific procedures and the IVRS/ IWRS/WBDC/and/or ePRO 
system(s) utilized.  
The Principal Investigator will ensure that approp riate training relevant to the study is given to all of 
these staff, and that any new information relevant to the performance of this study is forwarded to the 
staff involved.  
The Principal Investigator will maintain a record of all individuals involved in  the study (medical, 
nursing and other staff).  
9.2 Monitoring of the study  
During the study, an AstraZeneca representative will have regular contacts with the study site, 
including visits to:  
• Provide information and support to the Investigator(s) . 
• Confirm that  facilities remain acceptable . 
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately and timely recorded in the eCRFs, that biological samples are handled in 
accordance with the Laboratory Manual and that study d rug accountability checks are 
being performed . 
• Perform source data verification (a comparison of the data in the eCRFs with the subject’s 
medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to the study) 
including verification of inform ed consent of participating subjects. This will require 
direct access to all original records for each subject (e.g., clinic charts) . 
• Ensure withdrawal of informed consent to the use of the subject’s biological samples is 
reported and biological samples ar e identified and disposed of/destroyed accordingly, and 
the action is documented, and reported to the subject.  
The AstraZeneca representative will be available between visits if the Investigator(s) or other staff at 
the center needs information and advice about the study conduct.  
9.2.1 Source data  
Refer to the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA) for location of source data.     
9.2.2 Study agreements  
The Principal Investigator at each center should comply with all the terms, conditions, and obligations 
of the CSA or equival ent, for this study. In the event of any inconsistency between this CSP and the 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  125 (170) CSA the terms of CSP shall prevail with respect to the conduct of the study and the treatment of 
subjects and in all other respects, not relating to study conduct or treatment of subjects, the terms of the 
CSA shall prevail. Agreements between AstraZeneca and the Principal Investigator should be in place 
before any study -related procedures can take place, or any subjects are enrolled.  
9.2.3 Archiving of study documents  
The investigato r follows the principles outlined in the CSA.  
9.3 Study timetable and end of study  
The end of this study is defined as ‘the last visit of the last subject undergoing the study’.  
There will be a final data cut -off defined as the time of final OS analysis (see Section 8.5.3.3 ).  At this 
time point, the clinical study database will close to new data.  Subjects are, however, permitted to 
continue to receive study treatment beyond the closure of the database if, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, they are continuing to receive benefit from study treatment.  AstraZeneca will conti nue to 
supply olaparib for subjects in the study.   NHA will be continued by local supply under standard of 
care. For subjects who do continue to receive olaparib treatment beyond the time of this data cut -off, 
Investigators will continue to report all SAEs  to AstraZeneca Patient Safety until 30 days after study 
treatment is discontinued, in accordance with Section 6.4 (Reporting of Serious Adverse Events). If an 
Investigator learns of any SAEs, including death, at any time after a subject has completed the study, 
and he/she considers there is a reasonable possibility that the event is causally related to the 
investigat ional product, the Investigator should notify AstraZeneca, Patient Safety.  Additionally as 
stated in Section 6.3 (Recording of adverse events), an y SAE or non -serious adverse event that is 
ongoing at the time of this data cut -off, must be followed up to resolution unless the event is 
considered by the investigator to be unlikely to resolve, or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
The study is expected to start in Q1 2017 and to end by Q1 2021 . 
The study may be terminated at individual centres if the study procedures are not being performed 
according to GCP, or if recruitment is slow.  AstraZeneca may also terminate the entire study 
prematurely if concer ns for safety arise within this study or in any other study with olaparib.  
9.4 Data management by AstraZeneca or delegate  
Data management will be performed by a chosen vendor according to the Data Management Plan.  
Data entered in the WBDC system or data captur ed electronically will be immediately saved to the 
applicable database and changes tracked to provide an audit trail.  
The data collected through third party sources will be obtained and reconciled against study data.  
Adverse events and medical/surgical his tory will be classified according to the terminology of the 
latest version the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Medications will be 
classified according to the WHO Drug Dictionary.  All coding will be performed by the Medical 
Coding Team at the chosen vendor.  
Data queries will be raised for inconsistent, impossible or missing data.  All entries to the study 
database will be available in an audit trail.  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  126 (170) The data will be validated as defined in the Data Management Plan.  Quality control  procedures will be 
applied to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable and have been processed 
correctly.  The Data Management Plan will also clarify the roles and responsibilities of the various 
functions and personnel involved in  the data management process.  
When all data have been coded, validated, signed and locked, clean file will be declared.  Any 
treatment revealing data may thereafter be added and the final database will be locked.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reconciliation  
SAE reconciliation reports are produced and reconciled with the Subject Safety database and/or the 
investigational site.  
Data Management of genotype data  
See Appendix C – Pharmacogenetics Research.  
Data associated with human biological samples  
Data associ ated with biological samples will be transferred from laboratory (ies) internal or external to 
AstraZeneca.  
Management of external data  
Data from external providers (e.g. , central laboratories) will be validated as appropriate to ensure it is 
consistent wi th the clinical data and included in the final database. In the case of biomarker (tumour 
tissue or blood for exploratory analyses) data, the results of any analyses will not be recorded in the 
database, but information relating to the processing of the sa mple, including the original date of biopsy 
(historical tumour tissue sample and the actual date the sample(s) were collected) will be recorded in 
the eCRF and database.  
10. ETHICAL AND REGULATO RY REQUIREMENTS  
10.1 Ethical conduct of the study  
The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH/Good Clinical Practice, applicable regulatory 
requirements and the AstraZeneca policy on Bioethics and Human Biological Sample s. 
10.2 Subject data protection  
The Informed Consent Form will incorporate (or, in some cases, be accompanied by a separate 
document incorporating) wording that complies with relevant data protection and privacy legislation.  
AstraZeneca will not provide indivi dual genotype results from PGx to subjects, any insurance 
company, any employer, their family members, general physician or any other third party, unless 
required to do so by law . 
Precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data b eing linked to the identity 
of the Subject. In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might see both the genetic 
data and the personal identifiers of a Subject. For example, in the case of a medical emergency, an 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  127 (170) AstraZeneca Physician or a n Investigator might know a Subject’s identity and also have access to his 
or her genetic data. Also Regulatory authorities may require access to the relevant files, though the 
Subject’s medical information and the genetic files would remain physically sep arate.  
10.3 Ethics and regulatory review  
An Ethics Committee should approve the final study protocol, including the final version of the 
Informed Consent Form and any other written information and/or materials to be provided to the 
subjects.  The Investigator will ensure the distribution of these documents to the applicable Ethics 
Committee, and to the study site staff.  
The opinion of the Ethics Committee should be given in writing. The Investigator should submit the 
written approval to AstraZeneca  before enrol lment of any subject into the study.  
The Ethics Committee should approve all advertising used to recruit subjects for the study.  
AstraZeneca should approve any modifications to the Informed Consent Form that are needed to meet 
local requireme nts. 
If required by local regulations, the protocol should be re -approved by the Ethics Committee annually.  
Before enro llment of any subject into the study, the final study protocol, including the final version of 
the Informed Consent Form, is approved by the national regulatory authority or a notification to the 
national regulatory authority is done, according to local regulations.  
AstraZeneca will handle the distribution of any of these documents to the national regulatory 
authorities.  
AstraZeneca will pr ovide Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Principal Investigators with 
safety updates/reports according to local requirements.  
10.4 Informed consent  
The Principal Investigator(s) at each center  will: 
• Ensure each subject is given full and adequate oral  and written information about the 
nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study, information about alternative 
treatment with non -investigational drugs . 
• Ensure each subject is notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any time. 
• Ensure that each subject is given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to 
consider the information provided . 
• Ensure each subject provides signed and dated informed consent before conducting any 
procedure specifically for the study . 
• Ensur e the original, signed Informed Consent Form(s) is/are stored in the Investigator’s 
Study File . 
• Ensure a copy of the signed Informed Consent Form is given to the subject .

Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  128 (170) • Ensure that any incentives for subjects who participate in the study as well as any 
provisions for subjects harmed as a consequence of study participation are described in 
the informed consent form that is approved by an Ethics Committee.  
10.5 Changes to the protocol and informed consent form  
Study procedures will not be changed without the mut ual agreement of the International co -ordinating 
Investigators and AstraZeneca.  
If there are any substantial changes to the study protocol, then these changes will be documented in a 
study protocol amendment and where required in a new version of the study  protocol (Revised Clinical 
Study Protocol).  
The amendment is to be approved by the relevant Ethics Committee and if applicable, also the national 
regulatory authority approval, before implementation.  Local requirements are to be followed for 
revised prot ocols.  
AstraZeneca will distribute any subsequent amendments and new versions of the protocol to each 
Principal Investigator (s). For distribution to Ethics Committee see Section 10.3. 
If a protocol amendment requires a change to a centre’s Informed Consent Form, AstraZeneca and the 
centre’s Ethics Committee are to approve the revised Informed Consent Form before the revised form 
is used.  
If local reg ulations require, any administrative change will be communicated to or approved by each 
Ethics Committee.  
10.6 Audits and inspections  
Authorized representatives of AstraZeneca, a regulatory authority, or an Ethics Committee may 
perform audits or inspections at the center, including source data verification.  The purpose of an audit 
or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and 
documents, to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, 
and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), guidelines of the 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), and any applicable regulatory requirements.  The 
Investigator will contact AstraZeneca immediately  if contacted by a regulatory agency about an 
inspection at the center.

  135 (170) Appendix A Additional Safety Information  
Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Life threatening  
‘Life -threatening’ means that the Subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred or 
it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the Subject’s death.  ‘Life -
threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it might have caused death 
(e.g., hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).  
Hospitalization  
Out subject treatment in an  emergency room is not in itself a serious AE, although the reasons for it 
may be (e.g., bronchospasm, laryngeal edema).  Hospital admissions and/or surgical operations 
planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease exist ed before the 
Subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the 
study.  
Important medical event or medical intervention  
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death, 
hospitalization, disability or incapacity but may jeopardize the Subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one or more outcomes li sted in the definition of serious.  These should usually 
be considered as serious.  
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used.  
• Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone treatment  
• Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with N -
acetylcysteine  
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm  
• Blood dyscrasias (e.g., neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization  
Development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question  
When making an assessment of causality consider the following fact ors when deciding if there is a 
‘reasonable possibility’  that an AE may have been caused by the drug.  
• Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the Subject actually received the suspect drug?  
Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to th e administration of the suspect 
drug?  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  136 (170) • Consistency with known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous knowledge of 
the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? 
Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological properties?  
• De-challenge  experience.  Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose of 
the suspect drug?  
• No alternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another etiology such as the 
underlying disease, o ther drugs, other host or environmental factors.  
• Re-challenge  experience.  Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or support a re-challenge . 
• Laboratory tests.  A specifi c laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship . 
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:  
• Is this a recognized  feature of overdose of the drug?  
• Is there a known mechanism?  
Causality of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expression ‘reasonable 
possibility’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are fac ts (evidence) or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
The causality assessment is performed based on the available data including enough information to 
make an informed judgment.  With limited or insufficient information in the case, it is likely th at the 
event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.  
Causal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of effect should 
be classified as no reasonable possibility.  
Medication error  
For the purposes of this clinical study a medication error is an unintended failure or mistake in the 
treatment process for an AstraZeneca study drug that either causes harm to the participant or has the 
potential to cause harm to the participant.    
A medi cation error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process related failure 
while the drug is in control of the study site staff or participant.  
Medication error includes situations where an error.    
• occurred  
• was identified and intercep ted before the participant received the drug  
• did not occur, but circumstances were recognize that could have led to an error

Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  137 (170)  
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:  
• Drug name confusion  
• Dispensing error e.g. , medication prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given to 
the participant  
• Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administration  
• Drug not taken as indicated e.g. , tablet dissolved in water when it should be taken as a  solid 
tablet  
• Drug not stored as instructed e.g. , kept in the fridge when it should be at room temperature  
• Wrong participant received the medication (excluding IVRS/IWRS errors)  
• Wrong drug administered to participant (excluding IVRS/IWRS errors)  
 
Example s of events that do not  require reporting as medication errors in clinical studies:  
• Errors related to or resulting from IVRS/IWRS - including those which lead to one of the 
above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error  
• Participant accidentally missed drug dose(s) e.g. , forgot to take medication  
• Accidental overdose (will be captured as an overdose)  
• Participant failed to return unused medication or empty packaging  
• Errors related to background and rescue medication, or standard of care  medication in open 
label studies, even if an AZ product  
Medication errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the medication 
error.

  138 (170) Appendix B International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) 6.2 
Guidance Document  
Labelling and shipment of biohazard samples  
International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) classifies biohazardous agents into 3 
categories.  For transport purposes the classification of infectious substances according to risk groups 
was removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) in the 46th edition (2005).  Infectious 
substances are now classified either as Category A, Category B or Exempt.  There is no direct 
relationship between Risk Groups and categories A and B.  
Category A  Infectious Substances  are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to it 
occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability, life -threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy  
humans or animals.  Category A pathogens are e.g., Ebola, Lassa fever virus:  
• Are to be packed and shipped in accordance with IATA Instruction 602.  
Category B Infectious Substances  are infectious Substances that do not meet the criteria for inclusion 
in Ca tegory A.  Category B pathogens are e.g., Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses, Human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2.  They are assigned the following UN number and proper 
shipping name:  
• UN 3373 – Biological Substance, Category B  
• are to be packe d in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650  
Exempt - all other materials with minimal risk of containing pathogens  
• Clinical trial samples will fall into Category B or exempt under IATA regulations . 
• Clinical trial samples will routinely be packed and transport ed at ambient temperature in IATA 
650 compliant packaging .  
• Biological samples transported in dry ice require additional dangerous goods specification for 
the dry -ice content . 
• IATA compliant courier and packaging materials should be used for packing and 
transportation and packing should be done by an IATA certified person, as applicable . 
• Samples routinely transported by road or rail are Subject to local regulations which require that 
they are also packed and transported in a safe and appropriate way to cont ain any risk of 
infection or contamination by using approved couriers and packaging / containment materials 
at all times.  The IATA 650 biological sample containment standards are encouraged wherever 
possible when road or rail transport is used.

  139 (170) Appendix C Pharmacogenetics Research  
Background and Rationale  
AstraZeneca intends to perform genetic research in the olaparib clinical development program to 
explore how genetic variations may affect the clinical parameters associated with olaparib and/or 
agents used in combination or as comparators.  Collection of DNA samples from populations with well 
described clinical characteristics may lead to improvements in the design and interpretation of clinical  
trials and, possibly, to genetically guided treatment strategies.  
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not only 
response to olaparib and/or agents used in combination or as comparators but also susceptib ility to 
disease and/or response for which olaparib may be evaluated. Thus, this genetic research may involve 
study of additional un -named genes or gene categories for the purpose of diagnostic development or 
other exploratory research, but only as related  to disease susceptibility and drug action.  
Genetic Research Objectives  
The objective of this research is to collect and store DNA for future exploratory research into 
genes/genetic variation that may influence response (i .e., distribution, safety, tolerab ility and efficacy) 
to olaparib.  
Study selection record  
Subjects will be asked to participate in this genetic research.  Participation is voluntary and if a subject 
declines to participate there will be no penalty or loss of benefit.  The subject will not be excluded 
from any aspect of the main study.  
Inclusion criteria  
For inclusion in this genetic research, subjects must fulfil l all of the inclusion criteria described in the 
main body of the Clinical Study Protocol and: 
• Provide informed consent for the ge netic sampling and analyses.  
Exclusion criteria  
Exclusion from this genetic research may be for any of the exclusion criteria specified in the main 
study or any of the following:  
• Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant  
• Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusion in 120 days of genetic sample collection  
Discontinuation of Subjects from this genetic research  
Specific reasons for discontinuing a subject from this genetic research are:  
Withdrawal of consent for genetic research:  Subjects may withdra w from this genetic research at any 
time, independent of any decision concerning participation in other aspects of the main study.  
Voluntary discontinuation will not prejudice further treatment.  Procedures for discontinuation are 
outlined in Section 3.10.2  of the main study protocol.

Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
  140 (170) Collection of samples for genetic research  
The blood sample for genetic research will be obtained from the subjects at Visit 2 (day 0) baseline. 
Although genotype is a stable parameter, early sample collection is preferred to avoid introducing bias 
through excluding subjects who may withdraw due to an adverse event (AE), such subjects would be 
important to include in any genetic a nalysis. If for any reason the sample is not drawn at baseline, it 
may be taken at any visit until the last study visit. Only one sample should be collected per subject for 
genetics during the study. See the laboratory manual for blood volume, and sample m anagement 
details.  
Coding and storage of DNA samples  
The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genetic analysis are important to 
maintain Subject confidentiality. Samples will be stored for a maximum of 15 years, from the date of 
last Subject last visit, after which they will be destroyed. DNA is a finite resource that is used up 
during analyses. Samples will be stored and used until no further analyses are possible or the 
maximum storage time has been reached.  
For all samples irrespec tive of the type of coding used the DNA will be extracted from the blood 
sample.  The DNA sample will be assigned a unique number replacing the information on the sample 
tube.  Thereafter, the DNA sample will be identifiable by the unique DNA number only.  The DNA 
number is used to identify the sample and corresponding data at the AstraZeneca genetics laboratories, 
or at the designated contract laboratory.  No personal details identifying the individual will be 
available to any person (AstraZeneca employee or contract laboratory staff working with the DNA.)  
The samples and data for genetic analysis in this study will be single coded.  The link between the 
subject enrol lment/randomization code and the DNA number will be maintained and stored in a secure 
envir onment, with restricted access WITHIN the Clinical Genotyping Group Laboratory Information 
Management System (LIMS) at AstraZeneca.  The link will be used to identify the relevant DNA 
samples for analysis, facilitate correlation of genotypic results with c linical data, allow regulatory audit 
and to trace samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal of consent.  
Ethical and Regulatory Requirements  
The principles for ethical and regulatory requirements for the study, including this genetics research 
compo nent, are outlined in Section 10 of the protocol.  
Informed Consent  
The genetic component of this study is optional and the subject may participate in other components of  
the main study without participating in the genetic component.  To participate in the genetic 
component of the study the subject must sign and date both the consent for the main study and the 
genetic component of the study.  Copies of signed and dated con sent forms must be given to the 
subject and the original filed at the study center.  The investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that 
consent is given freely and that the Subject understands that they may freely discontinue from the 
genetic aspect of t he study at any time.

  141 (170) Subject Data Protection  
AstraZeneca will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, any insurance company, any 
employer, their family members, general physician or any other third party, unless required to do so by 
law. 
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being linked to the 
identity of the subject.  In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might see both the 
genetic data and the personal identifiers of a Subject.   For example, in the case of a medical 
emergency, an AstraZeneca Physician or an investigator might know a subject’s identity and also have 
access to his or her genetic data.  Also Regulatory authorities may require access to the relevant files, 
though th e subject’s medical information and the genetic files would remain physically separate.  
Data Management  
Any genotype data generated in this study will be stored in the AstraZeneca genotyping LIMS 
database, or other appropriate secure system within AstraZen eca and/or third party contracted to work 
with AstraZeneca to analyze the samples.  
The results from this genetic research may be reported in the CSR for the main study, or in a separate 
report as appropriate.  
Some or all of the clinical datasets from the m ain study may be merged with the genetic data in a 
suitable secure environment separate from the clinical database.  
Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size  
The number of subjects that will agree to participate in the genetic research is unkno wn.  It is therefore 
not possible to establish whether sufficient data will be collected to allow a formal statistical 
evaluation or whether only descriptive statistics will be generated.  A statistical analysis plan will be 
prepared where appropriate.

142(170) Appendix D Actions Required in Cases of Increases in Liver 
Biochemistry and Evaluation of Hy’s Law  
Introduction  
This Appendix describes the process to be followed in order to identify and appropriately report cases 
of Hy’s Law.  It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management of elevated liver 
biochemistries. Specific guidance on the managing liver abnormalities can be found in Section 6.3.7  of 
the protocol.  
During the course of the study the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry.  
The investigator is responsible for determining whether a subject meets potential Hy’s Law (PHL) 
criteria at any point during the study.  
The Investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in review and 
assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria are met.  HL 
criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation f or the elevations in liver biochemistry other than 
Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP).  
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting 
Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome of the review and 
assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes.  
Definitions  
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)  
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3x Upper Limi t of Normal 
(ULN) together with  Total Bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2xULN at any point during the study following the start 
of study medication  irrespective of an increase in Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP).   
Hy’s Law (HL)  
AST or ALT ≥ 3x ULN together with TBL ≥ 2xULN, whe re no other reason, other than the IMP, can 
be found to explain the combination of increases, e .g., elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, viral 
hepatitis, another drug.   
For PHL and HL the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (i.e. , on the same 
day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in 
transaminases and TBL must occur.  
Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases  
In order to identify cases of PHL it is important to perform a comprehe nsive review of laboratory data 
for any subject who meets any of the following identification criteria in isolation or in combination:  
• ALT ≥ 3xULN  
• AST ≥ 3xULN  
• TBL ≥ 2xULN  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
143(170) When a subject meets any of the identification criteria, in isolation or in combination, the central 
laboratory will immediately send an alert to the Investigator (also sent to AstraZeneca representative).  
The Investigator will also remain vigilant for an y local laboratory reports where the identification 
criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:  
• Notify the AstraZeneca representative . 
• Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by the central laboratory . 
• Complete the appropriate uns cheduled laboratory CRF module(s) with the original local 
laboratory test result . 
When the identification criteria are met from central or local laboratory results the Investigator will 
without delay:  
• Determine whether the subject meets PHL criteria ( see Definitions  within this Appendix for 
definition) by reviewing laboratory reports from all pr evious visits (including both central and 
local laboratory results) . 
Follow -up 
Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met  
If the subject does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:  
• Inform the AstraZeneca representative that the subject has not met PHL criteria.  
• Perform follow -up on subsequent laboratory results acc ording to the guidance provided in the 
Clinical Study Protocol.  
Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met  
If the subject does meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:  
• Determine whether PHL criteria were met at any study visit prior to starting study treatment 
(See Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria are Met Before and After Starting 
Study Treatment ). 
• Notify the AstraZeneca representative who will then inform the central Study Team .  
The Study Physician contacts the Investigator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an approach for 
the study subjects’ follow -up and the continuous review of data.  Subsequent to this contact the 
Investigator will:  
• Monitor the subject until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical symptoms and 
signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated .  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
144(170) • Investigate the etiology of the event and perform diagnostic  investigations as discussed with 
the Study Physician. This includes deciding which the tests available in the Hy’s law lab kit 
should be used .  
• Complete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available .  
• If at any time (in consultation with th e Study Physician) the PHL case meets serious criteria, 
report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedures . 
Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases  
The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met.  
No later than 3 weeks after the biochemistry abnormality was initially detected, the Study Physician 
contacts the Investigator in order to review available data and agree on whether there is an alternative 
explanation for meeting PHL criteria other than D ILI caused by the IMP.  The AstraZeneca Medical 
Science Director and Global Safety Physician will also be involved in this review together with other 
Subject matter experts as appropriate.   
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Invest igator will follow the instructions 
below.  
If there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a determination 
of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequently whether the AE meets 
the criteria for a SAE:  
• If the alternative explanation is not an AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF . 
• If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the CRF accordingly and 
follow the AZ standard processes . 
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL elevations 
other than the IMP:  
• Report an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to AstraZeneca standard processes.  
− The ‘Medically Important’ serious criterion should be used if no othe r serious criteria 
apply . 
− As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.  
If, there is an unavoidable delay, of over 3 weeks, in obtaining the information necessary to assess 
whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no alternative 
explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made:  
• Report an SAE (report term ‘Potential Hy’s Law’) applying serious criteria and causality 
assessment as per above .

Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
145(170) • Continue follow -up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary supplementary 
information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine whether HL criteria are 
met.  Update the SAE report according to the outcome of the revi ew. 
Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria are Met Before and After Starting 
Study Treatment  
This Section is applicable to subjects with liver metastases who meet PHL criteria on study treatment 
having previously met PHL criteria at a study vis it prior to starting study treatment.  
At the first on study treatment occurrence of PHL criteria being met the Investigator will:  
• Determine if there has been a significant change in the subjects’ condition# compared with the 
last visit where PHL criteria w ere met#. 
− If there is no significant change no action is required . 
− If there is a significant change notify the AstraZeneca representative, who will inform 
the central Study Team, then follow the subsequent process described in Potential 
Hy’s Law Criteria met  of this Appendix . 
# A ‘significant’ change in the subject’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any of the 
individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or total bilirubin) in isolation or in combination, 
or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determination of whether there has been a 
significant change will be at the discretion of the Investigator, t his may be in consultation with the 
Study Physician if there is any uncertainty.  
Actions Required for Repeat Episodes of Potential Hy’s Law  
This Section is applicable when a subject meets PHL criteria on study treatment and has already met 
PHL criteria at a previous on study treatment visit.  
The requirement to conduct follow -up, review and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of PHL is 
based on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence.   
The investigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being met and 
answer the following question:  
• Was the alternative cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being met found to be 
the disease under study e.g. , chronic or progressing ma lignant disease, severe infection or liver 
disease or did the subject meet PHL criteria prior to starting study treatment and at their first 
on study treatment visit as described in Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria 
are Met Before and After Starting Study Treatment ? 
If no: follow the process described in Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met  of this Appendix  
If yes: determine if there has been a significant change in the subject’s condition# compared with when 
PHL criteria were previously met  
• If there is no significant change no action is re quired .

ASSESSMENT OF SOFT T ISSUE DISEASE USING RECIST 1.1 
CRITERIA  
Definition of measurable, non -measurable, target and non -target lesions  
In this study, bone lesions will not be included in the RECIST assessment as target lesions, non -target -
lesions (NTL) or new lesions. The guidelines for bone lesion assessments are defined in the bone 
lesion section  of this appendix document.  
Measurable:  
A lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured at baseline as ≥ 10 mm in the 
longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis ≥ 15 mm) with c omputed 
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and which is suitable for accurate repeated 
measurements.  
Non-measurable:  
• All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph 
nodes with ≥10 to <15mm short axis at baseline*).  
• Truly non -measurable lesions include the following: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural / pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of 
skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical

• Previously irradiated lesions** . 
*Nodes with <10mm short axis are considered non -pathological and should not be recorded or 
followed as NTL.  
**Locali zed post -radiation changes which affect lesion sizes may occur.   Therefore, lesions that have 
been previously irradiated will not be considered measurable and must be selected as Non -Target 
Lesions (NTL) at baseline and followed up as part of the NTL assessment.

148(170) Special Cases:  
• Cystic metastases can be considered measu rable lesions if they meet the criteria for 
measurability from a radiological point of view, but if non -cystic lesions are present in the 
same subject, these should be selected as target lesions.  
Target lesions:  
A maximum of 5 measurable lesions (with a ma ximum of 2 lesions per organ), representative of all 
lesions involved suitable for accurate repeated measurement, should be identified as target lesions (TL) 
at baseline.  
Non-Target lesions:  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL should  be identified as NTL at baseline 
(except bone lesions which will be assessed as defined in bone lesion section of this appendix) . 
Methods of assessment  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and  recorded lesion at baseline and during follow -up visits.  
A summary of the methods to be used for RECIST assessment is provided below and those excluded 
from tumor assessments for this study are highlighted, with the rationale provided.

CT and MRI  
CT and MRI are generally considered to be the best currently available and reproducible methods to 
measure TL selected for response assessment and to assess NTL and identification of any new lesions.  
In the D081DC00007 study it is recommended that CT exam inations of the chest, abdomen and pelvis 
will be used to assess tumor burden at baseline and follow -up visits.  CT examination with intravenous 
(i.v.) contrast media administration is the preferred method.  MRI should be used where CT is not 
feasible or i t is medically contra -indicated.  For brain lesion assessment, MRI is the preferred method.  
Every effort should be made to maintain the radiologic imaging modality used at baseline throughout 
subsequent assessments.  
Chest X -ray 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
149(170) In the D081DC00007  study, c hest x -ray assessment will not be used for assessment of TL as they will 
be assessed by CT examination or MRI examination.  Chest X -ray can, however, be used to assess 
NTL and to identify the presence of new lesions.  
Ultrasound  
In the D081DC00007 study, ultrasound examination will not be used for assessment of TL and NTL as 
it is not a reproducible method, does not provide an accurate assessment of tumor size and it is 
subjective and operator dependent.  Ultrasound examination can, howe ver, be used to identify the 
presence of new lesions.  If new clinical symptoms occur and an ultrasound is performed then new 
lesions should be confirmed by CT or MRI examination.  
Endoscopy and laparoscopy  
In the D081DC00007  study, endoscopy and laparosco py will not be used for tumor assessments as 
they are not validated in the context of tumor assessment.  
Tumor markers  
In the D081DC00007  study tumor markers will not be used for tumor response assessments as per 
RECIST 1.1.  
In this study the following mar ker (PSA)  are being collected for separate analysis.  However, the 
results will not contribute to tumor response based on RECIST 1.1 assessment.  
Cytology and histology  
In the D081DC00007  study histology and will not be used for tumor response assessments as per 
RECIST 1.1 and tumor response assessments will be performed on radiological criteria only.   
FDG -PET scan  
In the D081DC00007  study FDG -PET scans may be used as a method for identifying new lesions, 
according with the following algorithm:  New lesio ns will be recorded where there is positive FDG 
uptake* not present on baseline FDG -PET scan or in a location corresponding to a new lesion on 
CT/MRI at the same follow -up visit.  If there is no baseline FDG -PET scan available, and no evidence 
of new lesio ns on CT/MRI scans then follow -up CT/MRI assessments should be continued, scheduled 
as per protocol or clinical indicated, in order to confirm new lesions.  
* A positive FDG -PET scan lesion should be reported only when an uptake greater than twice that of 
the surrounding tissue is observed.  
Tumor response evaluation  
Schedule of evaluation  
Baseline assessments should encompass all areas of known predilection for metastases in the disease 
under evaluation and should additionally investigate areas that may be involved based on signs and 
symptoms of individual subjects and should be performed n o more than 28 days before randomization. 
Follow -up assessments will be performed every 8 weeks (± 7 days) after randomization until objective 
disease progression by BICR as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) or PCWG3 (bone) , and after the 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib

Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
150(170) date of DCO for the primary analysis, by investigator -assessed radiographic progression . Any other 
sites at which new disease is suspected should also be adequately imaged at follow -up. 
If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the subject has not pro gressed, every attempt should 
be made to perform the subsequent assessments at their originally scheduled visits.  This schedule is to 
be followed in order to minimize any unintentional bias caused by some subjects being assessed at a 
different frequency t han other subjects.  
Target lesions (TL)  
Documentation of target lesions  
A maximum of 5 measurable lesions, with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ (including lymph nodes), 
representative of all lesions involved should be identified as TL at baseline.  Target  lesions should be 
selected on the basis of their size (longest diameter for non -nodal lesions or short axis for nodal 
lesions), but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  
It may be the case that, on occasi on, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement 
in which circumstance the next largest lesion, which can be measured reproducibly, should be selected.  
The site and location of each TL should be documented as well as the longest diam eter for non -nodal 
lesions (or short axis for lymph nodes). All measurements should be recorded in millimeters.  At 
baseline the sum of the diameters for all TL will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of 
diameters.  At follow -up visits the sum of diameters for all TL will be calculated and reported as the 
follow -up sum of diameters.  
Special cases:  
• For TL measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the longest diameter. For 
pathological lymph nodes measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always repor t the short axis.  
• If the CT/MRI slice thickness used is > 5mm, the minimum size of measurable disease at 
baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scan.  
• If a lesion has completely disappeared, the longest diameter should be recorded as 0 mm.  
• If a TL splits into two or more parts, then record the sum of the diameters of those parts.  
• If two or more TL merge then the sum of the diameters of the combined lesion should be 
recorded for one of the lesions and 0 mm recorded for the other lesion (s).   
• If a TL is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value 
of 5mm should be assigned.  If an accurate measure can be given, this should be recorded, 
even if it is below 5mm.  
• If a TL cannot be measured accurately due to it being too large, provide an estimate of the 
size of the lesion.  
• When a TL has had any intervention e.g. , radiotherapy, emboli zation, surgery etc., during 
the study, the size of the TL should still be provided where possible.

151(170) Evaluation of target  lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor visit response for 
TL. 
Table 17  Evaluation of target lesions  
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all target lesions since baseline.  Any 
pathological lymph nodes selected as target lesions must have a 
reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR)  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of TL, taking 
as reference the baseline sum of diameters  
Stable D isease (SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD  
Progressive Disease (PD)  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes t he 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the 
relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5mm.  
Not Evaluable (NE)  Only relevant if any of the target lesions were not assessed or not 
evaluable or had a lesion intervention at this visit. Note:  If the 
sum of diameters meets the progressive disease criteria, 
progressive disease overrides not evaluable as a target lesion 
response  
 
Non-Target lesions (NTL)  
Evaluation of non -target lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), except for bone lesions, not recorded as TL should be identified 
as NTL at baseline.  Measurements are not required for these lesions, but their status should be 
followed at subsequent visits.   At each visit  an overall assessment of the NTL response should be 
recorded by the Investigator.  This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine and 
record overall response for NTL at the investigational site at each visit.  
Table 18 Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all non -target lesions since baseline. All lymph 
nodes must be non -pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).  
Non CR/Non PD  Persistence of one or more NTL  
Progression (PD)  Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions.  
Unequivocal progression may be due to an important progression 
in one lesion only or in several lesions.  In all cases the 
progression MUST be clinic ally significant for the physician to 
consider changing (or stopping) therapy.  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Olaparib   
Study Code D081DC00007  
Version 4.0  
Date 07 March  2019  
 
152(170) Not Evaluable (NE)  Only relevant when one or some of the non -target lesions were not 
assessed and, in the Investigator's opinion, they are not able to 
provide an evaluable over all non -target lesion assessment at this 
visit.  
Note:  For subjects without target lesions at baseline, this is 
relevant if any of the non -target lesions were not assessed at this 
visit and the progression criteria have not been met.  
 
To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of non -target lesions, there must be an overall level 
of substantial worsening in non -target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target lesions, 
the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to me rit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest 
‘increase’ in the size of one or more non -target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for 
unequivocal progression status.  
New Lesions  
Details of any new soft tissue lesions will also be recorded with the date of assessment.  The presence 
of one or more new lesions is assessed as progression.  
A lesion identified at a follow up assessment in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.  
The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: i.e. , not attributable to differences in scanning 
technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something  other than tumor.  
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, the treatment and tumor assessments 
should be continued until the new lesion has been confirmed.  If repeat scans confirm there is a new 
lesion, then the progression da te should be declared using the date of the initial scan.  
Evaluation of Overall Visit Soft Tissue Response  
The overall visit response will be derived using the algorithm shown in Table 19.

ASSESSMENT  OF BONE LESION PROG RESSION USING PCWG3 
CRITERIA  
Bone lesions will be assessed by bone scan and will not be part of the RECIST v1.1 malignant soft 
tissue assessment.  
Method of assessment  
Bone lesions identified on a whole body isotopic bone scan at baselin e should be recorded and 
followed by the same method as per baseline assessment.   
In the D081DC00007  study isotopic bone scans will be used as a method of assessment to identify the 
presence of new bone lesions at follow -up visits.  New lesions will be re corded where a positive and 
unequivocal hot -spot that was not present on the baseline bone scan assessment is identified on a bone 
scan performed at any time during the study.  The Investigator should consider the positive hot -spot to 
be a significant new site of malignant disease and represent true disease progression in order to record 
the new lesion.   
Tumor progression evaluation  
Schedule of the evaluation  
Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before the start of study treatment.  
Follow -up assessments will be performed every 8 weeks (± 7 days) after randomization  until objective 
disease progression by BICR as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) or PCWG3 (bone).  
If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the subject has not progressed, every attempt should 
be made to perform the subsequent assessments at their originally scheduled visits.  This schedule is to 
be followed in order to minimize any unintentional bias caused by some subjects being assessed at a 
different frequenc y than other subjects.

154(170) All bone lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified at baseline.  Their status should be followed 
at subsequent visits.   At each visit an overall assessment of the bone lesion progression should be 
recorded by the Investigator.  This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine and 
record bone progression at the investigational site at each visit.  
Progression on a bone scan is identified using PCWG3 as follow:  
• At the 8 week scan:  
2 or more new metastatic bone lesions are observed on the first 8 -week scan compared to 
the baseline assessment. The confirmatory scan, performed at least 6  weeks later and 
preferably no later than the next scheduled visit for a bone scan (i .e,, Week  16), must show 
2 or more additional new metastatic bone lesions (for a total of 4 or more new metastatic 
bone lesions since the baseline assessment) for progression to be documented.  
Note - The first bone scan completed after baseline will be considered the ‘8 -week scan’ 
regardless if taken at week 8 or at an unscheduled assessment.  
• After the 8 week scan:  
2 or more new metastatic bone lesions are observed compared to the 8 ‑week assessment. 
The confirmatory scan, performed at least 6 weeks later  and preferably at the next 
scheduled visit for a bone scan, must show the persistence of or an increase in the number 
of metastatic bone lesions compared to the prior scan for progression to be documented.  
The date of progression is the date of the scan t hat first documents the second lesion.  
Evaluation of bone progression status  
Table 20 provides the definitions for the visit bone progression status for bone lesions.  
Table 20 Bone progression status  
Non Progressive Disease (Non -
PD) No evidence of progression, or appearance of one new bone 
lesion, or non -fulfil lment of the progression criteria including new 
lesions without confirmation of progression.  
Progressive Disease (PD)  Bone lesions fulfilling the requirements for at least 2 new lesions 
and confirmation of progression.  
Not Evaluable (NE)  Only relevant if a follow -up bone scan is not performed  
OVERALL RADIOLOGICAL  VISIT ASSESSMENT  
Table 21 provides the definitions how the visit responses fo r soft tissue (according to RECIST1.1 
criteria) and bone progression status (according to PCWG3 criteria) are combined to give an overall

a  if a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at subsequent time point, even disease meeting 
PR criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after 
CR). Best response would depend on  whether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes 
‘CR’ may be claimed when subsequent scan suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the 
subject had PR, not CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances , the original CR  should be 
changed to PR and the best response is PR.

Olaparib is regarded as a compound with medium/high foetal risk.  
Subjects must use a condom during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of olaparib when 
having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of childbearing potential.  Female 
partners of male subjects should also use a highly effective form of contraception if they are of 
childbearing potential (as listed below).  Male subjects should not donate sperm throughou t the period 
of taking olaparib and for 3 months following the last dose of olaparib.  
 Acceptable Non -hormonal birth control methods include:  
• Total/True abstinence: When the subject refrains from any form of sexual intercourse and this is in 
line with their usual and/or preferred lifestyle; this must continue for the total duration of the trial 
and for at least 3 months after the last dose of st udy drug. [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, 
ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods, or declaration of abstinence solely for the 
duration of a trial) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception]

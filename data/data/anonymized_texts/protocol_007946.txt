3/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 5 
RATIONALE  
Protocol GO41892, Version 5, has been amended primarily to update the adverse event 
management guidelines to align with the recent Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure , 
Version 19, and Cabozantinib Investigator ’s Bro chure , Version 18 . 
Changes to the protocol, along with a rationale for each change, are summarized below:  
 Two new ly approved indications for cabozantinib ha ve been added to align with the 
Cabozantinib Investigator’s Brochure, Version 18 (Section 1.3).  
 A note has been added that the completion of patient -reported outcome ( PRO ) 
questionnaires  will no longer be required  after the final overall survival ( OS) analysis  
(Sections 3.1, 4.5.9, 4.6.1.1, and Appendix  1). 
 The duration of follow -up after the complet ion of final OS analysis has been  
specified as 6 months after patient’s last dose of study treatment (Section s 3.1, 
4.5.6, 4.6.1.1, and Appendix 1).  
 The end-of-study definition has been  updated t o include the additional criteria of 
when  the last data point  required for safety follow -up has been received (if it occurs 
later than the required number of deaths for the final analysis OS), and the last 
patient ’s last visit has occurred .  Patients may continue on study treatment until the 
development of progressi ve disease , unacceptable toxicity, patient consent 
withdrawal, or Sponsor’s decision to terminate the study , whichever occurs first .  
The Sponsor will provide a written notification  to investigators  in the event that the 
study  has terminate d and the invest igators, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, 
may offer  suitable patients with potential enrollment to the continued access 
program or another study for continued access to study treatment (Section 3.2).    
 The medical term “Wegener granulomatosis” has  been replaced by the term 
“granulomatosis with polyangiitis” to align with the updated preferred term in Med ical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (Section 4.1.2  and Appendix 4) . 
 Text has been added to clarify that the number of pharmacokinetic ( PK) and anti-
drug antibody ( ADA) samples may be reduced or sample collection may cease 
altogether based on  emerging safety, activity, or efficacy data.  These c ollected 
samples may not be analyzed if not warranted.  Furthermore, a fter final OS analysis 
is conduc ted, the Sponsor may decide to no longer collect additional biomarker 
samples.  The existing collected samples may still be used for exploratory analysis.  
(Section 4.5.7, and Appendices 1 and 2).  
 The email address for withdrawal from the Research Biosample  Repository after site 
closure has been corrected (Section 4.5.10.6).  
 The list of identified risks for atezolizumab has been revised to include pericardial 
disorders, myelitis , and facial paresis .  In addition, hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has been updated from a potential risk to an identified 
risk associated with atezolizumab and language has been revised accordingly  
(Section 5.1.1 ). 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
4/Protocol GO41892, Version 5   The list of identified risks for cabozantinib has been revised to include venous and 
arterial thrombotic events , angioedema, and musculoskeletal disorders  
(Section  5.1.2).  
 The list of adverse events of special interest has been revised to include myelitis 
and facial paresis  (Section 5.2.3).  
 Personal identifiable information (i.e., name and telephone number) for the  Medical 
Monitors has been removed from the protocol .  Medical Monitor contact information 
has been replaced with a sentence indicating that this information will be provided 
separately to sites (Section 5.4.1).  
 A description of the technical and organizat ional security measures taken to protect 
personal data has been added to align with Roche practices (Section 8.4).  
 Due to certain local requirements and an alignment of Sponsor process, it has been 
clarified that summaries of clinical study results may be available in health authority 
databases for public access in addition to redacted Clinical Study Reports 
(Section  9.6). 
 Guidance  has been revised to indicate that caution should be used when 
considering atezolizumab for patients who have previously experienced a pericardial 
disorder while receiving another immunostimulatory anti -cancer agent .  Autoimmune 
myelitis has a lso been added to the table of autoimmune diseases (Appendix 4) . 
 The adverse event management guidelines  for risks associated with atezolizumab  
have been updated to align with the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure, 
Version  19, as well as Addendum 1 and 2 to the Atezolizumab Investigator's 
Brochure, Version 1 9.  Management guidelines for pericardial disorders, myelitis , 
and facial paresis  have been included, and HLH has been updated from a potential 
risk to an identified risk  (Appendix 6) . 
 The adverse eve nt management guidelines for risks associated with cabozantinib 
have been updated to align with the Cabozantinib Investigator’s Brochure, 
Version  18 (Appendix 7) . 
 
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency.  
Substantive new information appears in italics.  This amendment represents cumulative 
changes  to the original protocol.

1. BACKGROUND  
1.1 BACKGROUND ON NONSMALL CELL LUNG CANCER  
Lung cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancer s worldwide and is also the 
leading cause of cancer deaths in developed countries.   In the United States, it was 
estimated that 228,150 new cases (116,440 in men and 111, 710 in women) were 
diagnosed in 2019, while more than  142,670 deaths will occur (76,650 in men and 
66,020 in women; Torre et al . 2016;  Seigel et al . 2019) .  In Europe , 470,000 new cases 
of lung cancer  in 2018 have been estimated  (311,800 in men and 158,200 in women), 
while 387,900 deaths were expected to occ ur (267,300 in men and 120,600 in women; 
Ferlay et al . 2018).  
Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the predominant subtype of lung cancer, 
accounting for approximately 8 4% of all lung cancer cases (Howlader et al. 2015 ).  
NSCLC can be divided into two major histologic types:  adenocarcinoma and squamous 
cell carcinoma.  Adenocarcinoma histology accounts for more than half of all NSCLC, 
while squamous cell histology accounts for approximately 25% of NSCLC (Langer et al. 
2010).  The remaining cases of NSC LC are represented by large cell carcinoma, 
neuroendocrine tumors, sarcomatoid carcinoma, and poorly differentiated histology.  
The overall 5 -year survival rate for NSCLC is 23% but drops to as low as 6% for 
metastatic NSCLC (Cancer .Net 2019).  Poor prognos tic factors for survival in patients with 
NSCLC include advanced stage of disease at the time of initial diagnosis, poor 
performance status, and a history of unintentional weight loss.  More than half of the 
patients with NSCLC are diagnosed with distant d isease, which directly contributes to poor 
survival prospects.  
Treatment options for patients with Stage IV  NSCLC are informed by the presence or 
absence of genetic alterations.  Current treatment guidelines recommend testing for the 
genetic abnormalities including epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutations, 
anaplastic lymphoma kinase  (ALK) rearrangements, ROS1  rearrangements, and NTRK  
fusions and BRAF  mutations; as well as the presence or absence of PD-L1 expression 
on tumor or tumor -infiltrating im mune cells.  There are several other targets that are 
being tested for , including mesenchymal -epithelial transition  (MET ) alterations, 
rearranged during transfection  (RET) rearrangements, and HER2  mutation .  The 
introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI)-based therapy has transformed treatment 
approaches for many of these patients.  
Platinum -containing chemotherapy with or without vascular endothelial growth factor  
(VEGF ) targeted therapy (bevacizumab) has been the standard of care f ront-line therapy 
in patients with advanced NSCLC who do not  have genetic markers that can be 
selectively targeted.   Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI s) targeting the 
PD-L1/PD -1 signaling pathway have become a new treatment choice in patients with 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
22/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  metasta tic NSCLC by improving overall survival (OS) and progression -free survival 
(PFS) compared with standard chemotherapy (Reck et al . 2016; Gandhi et  al. 2018; 
Socinski et  al. 2018; Reck et al . 2019 ).  Currently, several antibody  plus chemotherapy 
combinations  are approved as first -line treatment of patients with metastatic 
nonsquamous NSCLC :  1) atezolizumab (anti PD-L1 antibody ) in combination with 
bevacizumab, paclitaxel , and carboplatin; 2) atezolizumab in combination with 
carboplatin and paclitaxel protein -bound ; and 3) pembrolizumab (anti PD-1 antibody ) in 
combination with pemetrexed and platinum -containing chemotherapy (Tecentriq U.S. 
Package Insert [USPI] and European Medicines Agency [ EMA ] Summary of Product 
Characteristics [ SmPC]; Keytruda USPI and EMA SmPC) .  Additionally, pembrolizumab 
in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein -bound is 
approved as first -line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC (Keytruda  
USPI  and EMA SmPC).   Pembrolizumab is a lso approved  as a monotherapy for the 
first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSC LC whose tumors express PD -L1 with 
no EGFR  or ALK translocations  (Keytruda  USPI  and EMA SmPC).  
In addition, several antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibodies  have been approved by regulatory 
agencies as a single -agent therapy in patients with NSCLC after prior 
platinum -containing therapy.  These include atezolizumab (Tecentriq  USPI  and EMA 
SmPC), nivolumab (Opdivo USPI  and EMA SmP C), and pembrolizumab (Keytruda  
USPI  and EMA SmPC).   The use of an antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody  earlier in the 
treatment paradi gm has created a high unmet medical need for antiPD-L1/PD -1 ICI and 
platinum -refractory patients in second and third lines of therapy .  
For patients who progress on an antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody  and platinum -containing  
chemotherapy given sequentially or in combination, additional treatment options include 
single -agent chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and pemetrexed (Planchard et al . 2018).  
The activity of single -agen t chemotherapy following platinum -containing first -line therapy 
is modest with objective response rate (ORR) of  10% and median PFS and OS ranging 
from 23 months and 8 9 months, respectively (Hanna et al . 2004; Garon et al . 2014 ).  
Although higher response rates have been reported for salvage chemotherapy following 
antiPD-L1/PD -1 ICI therapy , the median PFS and OS appear to be similar in antiPD-
L1/PD -1 ICI-pretreated and antiPD-L1/PD -1 ICI-naive patients who have previously 
received platinum -containing chemotherapy (Grigg et al . 2017; Schvartsman et al . 2017 ; 
Park et al . 2018 ).  Another treatment option for patients who progress on or after 
platinum -containing treatmen t is the combination of an anti -VEGF  receptor 2 (VEGFR2)  
antibody, ramucirumab, with docetaxel.  Compared with docetaxel alone, t his 
combination demonstrated a modest increase in median PFS (4.5 vs . 3.0 months) and 
median OS (10.5 vs . 9.1 months ; Garon et al . 2014) . 
1.2 BACKGROUND ON ATEZOLIZUMAB  
Atezolizumab  is a human ized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets PD -L1 and inhibits 
the interaction between PD -L1 and  its receptors, PD -1 and B7 -1 (also known as CD80) , 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
23/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  both of which function as inhibitory receptors expressed on T  cells.  Therapeutic 
blockade of PD -L1 binding by atezolizumab  has been shown to enhance  the magnitude 
and quality of tumor -specific T -cell respon ses, resulting in improved anti -tumor activity  
(Fehrenbacher et al. 2016; Rosenberg et al. 2016) .  Atezolizumab  has minimal  binding  
to fragment cry stallizable  (Fc) receptors, thus eliminating d etectable F c-effector function  
and associated antibody -mediated cl earance of activated effector T  cells.  
Atezolizumab shows anti -tumor activity in both nonclin ical models and cancer patients  
and is being investigated as a potential therapy in a wide variety of malignancies.  
Atezolizumab is being studied as a single agent in the advanced cancer and adjuvant 
therapy settings, as well as in combination with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and 
cancer immunotherapy.  
As noted above, a tezolizumab is approved as a combination therapy  with either 
bevacizumab, paclitaxel , and carboplatin; or with carboplatin and paclitaxel  
protein -bound  for the first -line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamo us 
NSCLC  (Tecentriq USPI, Tecentriq  EMA SmPC) .  Atezolizumab monotherapy  is 
approved  as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC  whose tumors have 
high PD -L1 expression (PD -L1 stained  50% of tumor cells [TC   50%] or PD -L1 stained 
tumor -infiltrating immune cells [IC] (Tecentriq USPI).  Atezolizumab monotherapy is also 
approved for patients  who have disease progression during or following platinum -
containing chemotherapy (Tecentriq USPI , Tecentriq EMA SmPC).   Additionally, 
atezolizumab is also approved for the tre atment of urothelial carcinoma,  small -cell lung 
cancer, triple -negative breast cancer , hepatocellular carcinoma, and melanoma . 
Refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for details on nonclinical  and clinical 
studies.  
1.3 BACKGROUND ON CABOZANTINIB  
Cabozantinib (XL184) is a potent, orally bioavailable inhibitor of multiple receptor 
tyrosine kinases (RTKs) known to play important roles in tumor cell proliferation and/or 
tumor neovascularization, including the VEGFR2 , MET, and RET.   Cabozantinib target s 
also include TYRO3, AXL, and MER  (TAM family kinases) and are implicated in 
promoting suppression of an anti -tumor immune response.  Preclinical studies (Kwilas 
et al. 2014;  Song  et al. 2015;  Lu et al . 2017) and clinical observations on circulating 
immun e suppressive cells and immune effector cells in cancer patients (Apolo et al . 
2014) suggest that cabozantinib promotes an immune -permissive environment, which 
might present an opportunity for synergistic effects from combination treatment with ICIs 
indepe ndent of PD -L1 expression.  
Cabozantinib (60 mg, tablets) is approved  as single agent for patients with advanced 
renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) and in combination with nivolumab as first -line treatment for 
patients with advanced RCC ( Cabomety x USPI ), for adult patients with advanced RCC 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
24/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  after prior VEGF -targeted therapy  or treatment -naïve adult patients w ith intermediate or 
poor risk RCC ( Cabometyx EMA SmPC) , and for patients with  hepa tocellular carcinoma  
who have previously been treated with sorafenib (Cabometyx  USPI  and EMA SmPC ).  In 
addition, c abozantinib ( 140 mg, capsules) is approved for patients with progressive, 
metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (Cometriq USPI  and EMA SmPC).  The capsule 
and tab let formulations are not bioequivalent or interchangeable.  
Cabozantinib (40 mg or 60 mg  tablets,  depending on body surface area ) is also approved 
for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with locally 
advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) that has progressed 
following prior VEGFR -targeted therapy and who are radioactive iodine (RAI) -
refractory or ineligible (Cabometyx USPI).   Additionally, the use of cabozantinib is 
approved in the E uropean Union  and other regions as a second -line treatment in 
RAI-refractory DTC in adult patients.  
Cabozantinib once a day  (QD) has been evaluated  as a single agent and in combination 
in several early  stage clinical trials in ICI-naive patients with advanced NSCLC.   In an 
open -label, randomized Phase II study  sponsored by National Cancer Institute (NCI), 
125 patients  with nonsquamous NSCLC without EGFR  genetic alterations received 
cabozantinib (60 mg QD), erlotinib (150 mg QD ), or both agents in combination (erlotinib 
150 mg QD   cabozantinib 40 mg QD ) as second - or third -line (post -platinum -containing 
chemotherapy) treatment (Neal et al . 2016 ).  Compared with erlotinib alone, the primary 
endpoint of PFS  was significantly improved in patient s receiving cabozantinib as single 
agent (4.3  vs. 1.8 months; hazard ratio  [HR]  0.39; p   0.0003) and in combination with 
erlotinib (4.7  vs. 1.8 months; HR   0.37;  p  0.0003).   The estimated median OS for 
patient s treated with cabozantinib al one was 9.2 months (95% CI: 5.1 to  15.0), for 
cabozantinib with erlotinib was 13.3  months (95% CI : 7.6 to  NR), and for erlotinib alone 
was 5.1 months (95% CI : 3.3 to 9.3).  The ORR for patients treated with cabozantinib 
alone was 11%.   Notably, progression as be st response was reported for 23 %24% for 
patients treated with cabozantinib alone or in combination with erlotinib, and 66% for 
patients treated with erlotinib alone .  The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse event s for 
single -agent cabozantinib were hypertension (25%), fatigue (15%), oral mucositis (10%), 
diarrhea (8%), and thromboembolic event s (8%).   One death due to respiratory failure 
assessed as possibly related to study drug occurred in the cabozantinib arm, and one 
death due to pneumonitis assessed as related to either study drug or the combination 
occurred in the erlotinib plus cabozantinib arm.  
In a Phase II randomized discontinuation trial in 526 patients across 9 disease cohort s, 
60 patients with advanced NSCLC of nonsquamous (n   43) or squamous cell (n   17) 
histology received cabozantinib 100 mg QD as a single agent ( Schöffski et al. 2017; 
Hellerstedt et al . 2019).  The ORR at Week 12 (primary endpoint) was 10%  in the 
NSCLC cohort , 6 patients had a confirmed partial response  (PR), and no patients had a  
complete response  (CR).  Over all disease -control rate (ORR   stable disease [ SD]) at 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
25/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  Week 12 was 38%.   Tumor regression was observed in 30 of 47 patients (64%) with at 
least one postbaseline radiographic tumor assessment.   Median PFS during the 
randomized stage was 2.4  months for the cabozantinib arm (median PFS during the 
entire treatment peri od from the start of the study was 4.2  months for all treated 
patients).  The most frequently reported  Grade 3  or 4 adverse event s were fatigue 
(13%), palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia  [PPE]  (10%), diarrhea (7%), hypertension 
(7%), and asthenia (5%) .  One treatment -related Grade 5 hemorrhage was reported ; 
however, based on a retrospective review  of the baseline tumor assessment , this patient 
should have been excluded from the study at screening as there was a tumor mass 
infiltrating the pulmonary artery, which was one of the exclusion criteria . 
Refer to the Cabozantinib Investigator's Brochure for details on nonclinical and clinical 
studies.  
1.4 ONGOING CLINICAL STU DY WITH ATEZOLIZUMAB AND 
CABOZANTINIB  
Cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab is currently being evaluated in a 
multi -cohort Phase Ib study in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors 
(COSMIC -021; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).   In the dose-escalation portion of this study , 12 patients 
with treatment -naive advanced RCC were treated at 2 dose levels of cabozantinib 
(6 patients each at 40 mg and 60 mg QD ) with atezolizuma b administered at 1200 mg 
intravenously ( IV) every 3 weeks ( Q3W ) (Agarwal et al . 2018).   The ORR at the 40 mg 
QD level was 50% (3 of 6 patients ), wh ile at the 60 mg QD  level it was 83% (5 of 
6 patients ).  There were no dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) or serious adverse events in 
either dose cohort.   Most adverse event s, including immune -mediated  adverse events , 
were Grade 1  or 2 in severity.  There were 3 patients (25%) who experienced Grade 3 
immune -mediated  adverse events (one event each of ALT increased, AST increase d, 
GGT increased, lipase increase d, and myositis ).  Other Grade 3 adverse event s 
included five events of hypertension, two events each of diarrhea an d 
hypophosphatemia, and one event each of lymphopenia , pulmonary embolism, nephritis,  
and hyperglycemia .  All adverse event s were manageable by dose modifications 
including dose reductions and dose delays as well as supportive care.   There were no 
Grade 4  or 5 adverse event s.  
Because of a more favorable safety profile of the 40 -mg cabozantinib dose level over a 
prolonged time on study treatment with less frequent dose reductions and encouraging 
preliminary efficacy, the cabozantinib dose of 40 mg QD  combi ned with atezolizumab at 
1200 mg Q3W  was selected by the Cohort Review Committee as the recommended 
dose for e xpansion stage in multiple solid tumor expansion cohorts in the COSMIC -021 
study .  One expansion c ohort (Cohort 7) is currently enrolling patients  with Stage IV 
nonsquamous  NSCLC who have radiographically progressed on or after treatment with 
one prior antiPD-1 or antiPD-L1 ICI  and platinum -containing chemotherapy for 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
26/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  metastatic disease.  This cohort has completed initial enrollment of 30 patients , and per 
protocol, has been allowed to enroll up to 50 additional patients .   
As of 21 Aug ust 2019, 33  patients have been enrolled and treated in the expansion  
Cohort 7 , of whom 27 patients were evaluable for efficacy.   Preliminary clinical activity is 
encouraging:  8 patients with a best respon se of PR (6 confirmed PRs and 
2 unconfirmed PRs) and 15 patients with a best response of SD.   The most common 
adverse event s of any grade regardless of causality in the 33 patients who were 
evaluable for safety comprised diarrhea (45%), fatigue (33%), constipation (30%), 
decreased appetite (27%), asthenia (24%), nausea (24%), hypertension (21%), and 
vomiting (21%).  Grade 4 adverse event s comprised n eutrophil count decrease (n   1), 
hyponatr emia (n   1), dehydration (n   1), atrial thrombosis (n   1), and white blood cell 
count decreased (n   1).  There were five  serious adverse events  considered to be 
related to study treatment (G rade 3 nausea, G rade 3 PPE, G rade 4 atrial thrombosis,  
Grade 4 dyspnea  and subsequent death in one patient ).  Grade 5 adverse event s 
observed were disease progression (n   2), death (n   2), completed suicide (n   1), 
sepsis second ary to disease progression (n   1), and general physical  health 
deterioration (n   1).  Only one of these Grade 5 events (death) is considered related to 
study treatment by  the investigator.  This patient had Grade 5 events considered related 
to atezolizumab (interstitial lung disease, myocarditis, and death).  
1.5 STUDY RATIONALE AND BENEFIT -RISK ASSESSMENT  
1.5.1  Study Rationale  
Encouraging clinical data emerging in the field of tumor immunotherapy have 
demonstrated that therapies focused on enhancing T -cell responses against cancer can 
result in a significant survival be nefit in patients with advanced malignancies  
(Hodi  et al. 2010; Kantoff et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2012).  
The use of antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody  in the first -line setting has shifted the treatment 
landscape creating a high unmet medical need for antiPD-L1/PD -1 ICI-refractory 
patients in second and third lines of therapy.  
For patients who progress on antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody  and platinum -containing 
chemotherapy given sequentially or in combination, additional treatment options include 
single -agent che motherapy, such as docetaxel and pemetrexed (NCCN 2019 ; European 
Society for Medical Oncology [ESMO]  guidelines for metastatic NSCLC, Planchard et al . 
2018).   Given the modest activity of these agents, there is a significant unmet need for 
novel treatment options in patients with NSCLC who have progressed on or after prior 
platinum -containing chemo therapy  and antiPD-L1/PD -1 therapies.  
The combination of atezolizumab and cabozantinib has shown encouraging preliminary 
clinical activity in patients  with Stage IV NSCLC who have radiographically progressed 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
27/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  on or after treatment with one prior anti -PD-1 or anti -PD-L1 ICI  and platinum -containing 
chemotherapy for metastatic disease  (see Section 1.4).  
This is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, open -label study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of atezolizumab given in combination with cabozantinib versus docetaxel 
monotherapy, in  patients with  metastatic  NSCLC who have progressed following prior  
treatment with  antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody  and platinum -containing chemotherapy.  
Evaluation of single -agent cabozantinib is being performed within the Phase Ib study 
(COSMIC -021), in which a single -agent cabozantinib cohort is enrolling a similar patient 
population as this Phase III study.  This allows for an evaluation of the contribution of the 
cabozantinib component of the combination  
1.5.2  Overall Benefit Risk  Assessment  
There is a significant unmet n eed in patients with metastatic NSCLC who have 
progressed following prior platinum -containing chemotherapy and antiPD-L1/PD -1 
antibody .  Currently, single -agent docetaxel  is the most frequently used treatment option  
available to these patients . 
This randomized, open -label, Phase III study evaluates the efficacy and safety of 
atezolizumab in combination with cabozantinib compared with docetaxel monotherapy in 
patients with metastatic NSCLC who have progressed on prior platinum -containing 
chemotherapy a nd antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody .  Preliminary clinical data with the 
combination of these two agents in the NSCLC cohort (Cohort 7) in the ongoing 
Phase  Ib study (COSMIC -021) have shown improved efficacy and long-term tolerability 
in patient s who have radiogra phically progressed on or after treatment with one prior 
anti-PD-1 or anti -PD-L1 ICI and platinum -containing chemotherapy for metastatic 
disease .  The combination of atezolizumab and cabozantinib has not been evaluated in 
squamous NSCLC.  However, single -agent activity of atezolizumab (Rittmeyer et al . 
2017; Section  1.2) and cabozantinib (Sch öffski et al . 2017;  Section  1.3) has been 
demonstrated in studies that evaluated both nonsquamous and squamous NSCLC 
where a similar treatment effect was observed with both histologies.  Atezolizumab and 
cabozantinib have each demonstrated single -agent clinical activity in previously treated 
patients with NSCLC (Sections  1.2 and 1.3).  The safety profile of each of the 
constituents of the combination is well -defined, and the combination has been studied in 
previous clinical trials with manageable safety profile .  Dose management guidelines are 
included in the current study protocol f or the most important risks.  
Thus, the overall benefit risk assessment is deemed favorable.  
In the setting of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic, patients with 
comorbidities, including those with cancer, are considered a more vulnerable population, 
with the potential for more severe clinical outcomes from severe acute respiratory 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
28/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) infection .  However, it  is unclear whether or how 
systemic cancer therapies such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy 
impact the incidence or severity of SARS -CoV-2 infection . 
A possible consequence of inhibiting the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway may be the modulation of 
the host immune response to acute infection, which may result in immunopathology or 
dysregulated immune system defenses.  In nonclinical models, PD -1/PD -L1 blockade is 
associated with serious exacerbation of inflammation in the setting of acute (as opposed 
to chronic) viral infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (Clone 13) ( Frebel  et al. 
2012).  However, there are insufficient and inconsistent clinical data to assess if 
outcome from SARS -CoV-2 infection  is altered by cancer immunotherapy.  
Severe SARS -CoV-2 infection  is associated with a cytokine -release syndrome (CRS) 
involving the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) -6, IL-10, IL -2, and interferon - 
(Merad and Martin 2020).  While it is not known , there may be a potential for an 
increased risk of an enhanced inflammatory response if a patient develops acute SARS -
CoV-2 infection while receiving atezolizumab.  At this time, there is insufficient evidence 
for causal association between atezolizumab an d an increased risk of severe outcomes 
from SARS -CoV-2 infection . 
There may be potential synergy or overlap in clinical and radiologic features for 
immune -mediated pulmonary toxicity with atezolizumab and clinical and radiologic 
features for SARS -CoV-2 related interstitial pneumonia.  Thus, investigators should use 
their clinical judgment when evaluating and managing patients with pulmonary 
symptoms.  
There are limited data concerning the possible interactions between cancer 
immunotherapy treatment and COVID -19 vaccination, and it is recognized that human 
immune responses are highly regulated and that immune -modifying therapies may 
positively or negatively impact the efficacy and safety of COVID -19 vaccination (Society 
for Immunotherapy of Cancer [SITC ] 2020) . 
Per recommendations of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network  (NCCN) 
COVID -19 Vaccination Advisory Committee, COVID -19 vaccination is recommended for 
all patients with cancer receiving active therapy (including ICIs), with the understanding 
that there  are limited safety and efficacy data in such patients ( NCCN 2021).  Given the 
lack of clinical data, currently no recommendations can be made regarding the optimal 
sequence of COVID -19 vaccination in patients who are receiving cancer immunotherapy 
(SITC 2020).  For patients enrolling in this study and receiving atezolizumab and 
cabozantinib treatment, a decision to administer the vaccine to a patient should be made 
on an individual basis by the investigator in consultation with the patient.  
In alignment wi th clinical practice procedures, factors to consider when making the 
individualized decision for patients receiving atezolizumab and cabozantinib treatment to 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
29/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  receive COVID -19 vaccination include the following:  the risk of SARS -CoV-2 infection 
and potenti al benefit from the vaccine, the general condition of the patient and potential 
complications associated with SARS -CoV-2 infection, underlying disease, and the 
severity of COVID -19 outbreak in a given area or region.  
SITC and NCCN recommendations along with institutional guidelines should be used by 
the investigator when deciding on administering COVID -19 vaccines.  When 
administered, COVID -19 vaccines must be given in accordance with the approved or 
authorized vaccine label.  Receipt of the COVID -19 vac cine is considered a concomitant 
medication and should be documented as such  (see Section  4.4.1 ).

3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE S TUDY  
This is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, open -label study designed to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab given in combination with 
cabozantinib compared with docetaxel monotherapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC, 
with no sensitizing EGFR  mutation or ALK translocation, who have progressed following 
treatment with platinum -containing chemotherapy  and antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody , 
administered concurrently or sequentially.  
Approximately 350 eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio at approximately 
125 global sites  in this trial.  
Figure  1 presents an overview of the study design.  A schedule of activities is provided in 
Appendix  1. 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
33/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  Figure  1 Study Schema  
 
Ab   antibody; NSCLC   nonsmall cell lung cancer; NSQ   nonsquamous; PO   by mouth; 
QD   once a day; Q3W   every 3  weeks; RECIST v1.1   Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors, Version 1.1; SQ   squamous.    
After providing informed consent, patients will undergo screening procedures as outlined  
in the schedule of activities in Appendix  1.  Patients who do not meet the criteria for 
participation in this study (screen failure) may qualify for one re -screening opportunity 
(for a total of two screenings per participant) at the inv estigator's discretion.  Patients are 
not required to re -sign the consent form.  The investigator will record reasons for screen 
failure in the screening log (see Section  4.5.1 ).  Screening period may be extend ed per 
investigators discretion bas ed on extenuating circumstances  (i.e., delayed lab oratory  
results ). 
Patients with tumors of non squamous histology with unknown EGFR  or ALK mutational 
status will be required to be tested either locally using a validated health  

 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
34/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  authorityapproved test or via central laboratory prior to enrollment (see specific 
exclusion  Section  4.1.2 ).  Patients with tumors of squamous histology who have an 
unknown EGFR  or ALK mutational status will not be required to be tested  (see specific 
exclusion  criteria in Section  4.1.2 ). 
Eligible patients will be in a randomized 1:1 ratio to receive either atezolizumab  plus 
cabozantinib  or docetaxel  monotherapy .  Randomization  will be stratified by : 
 Histology : nonsquamous versus  squamous   
 Prior NSCLC treatment regimen(s) at the following four levels:  
1. Concurrent platinum -containing chemotherapy and antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody 
combination  
2. Platinum -containing chemotherapy first,  disease progression occurs , followed 
by antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody  
3. AntiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody monotherapy first, disease progression occurs, 
followed by platinum -containing chemotherapy  without anti PD-L1/PD -1 
antibody  
4. AntiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody monotherapy first, disease progression occurs,  
followed by  continued anti -PD-L1/PD -1 antibody in combination with  platinum -
containing  chemotherapy added on  
 
In the experimental arm, atezolizumab (fixed dose of 1200  mg) will be administered by 
IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle.  Cabozantinib (40 mg) will be administered 
orally in tablet form (two table ts of 20 mg  each ) QD on Days 121 of each cycle.  In  the 
control arm, docetaxel (75 mg/m2) will be administered by IV on Day 1 of each 21 -day 
cycle.  
In the experimental arm :  Atezolizumab  and cabozantinib  treatment will continue until 
unacceptable toxicity, disease progression per RECIST  v1.1, or loss of cl inical benefit as 
determined by the investigator after an integrated assessment of radiographic and 
biochemical data, local biopsy results (if available), and clinical status (e.g., symptomatic 
deterioration such as pain secondary to disease).  During stud y treatment, p atients  who 
meet criteria for disease progression per RECIST  v1.1 and show evidence for clinical 
benefit may  continue atezolizumab  and/or cabozantinib treatment at the investigator’s 
discretion provided that the patients meet all of the following criteria:    
 Evidence of clinical benefit, as assessed by the investigator  
 Absence of symptoms and signs (including worsen ing of laboratory values 
[e.g.,  new or worsening hypercalcemia]) indicating unequivocal progression  of 
disease  
 No decline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group  (ECOG) Performance Status 
that can be attributed to  disease progression  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
35/Protocol GO41892, Version 5   Absence of tumor progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal 
disease) that cannot be managed by protocol -allowed medical intervent ions 
 Patients for whom other treatment options  and/or standard therapies exist must 
provide written consent to acknowledge deferring these treatment options in favor of 
continuing study treatment at the time of progression  
 
Patients randomized to the exper imental arm may be allowed to discontinue one 
component of the combination study treatment  but continue to receive the other 
component .  
In the control arm :  Docetaxel treatment will continue until unacceptable toxicity or 
disease progression  as assessed by the investigator  per RECIST  v1.1.  
Crossover from the control -arm to the experimental -arm will not be allowed.  
Patients will undergo tumor assessments at baseline , every 6 weeks  ( 7 days)  for the 
first 48  weeks following Day 1 of Cycle 1 , and every 9 weeks ( 7 days) after completion 
of the Week 48 tumor assessment regardless of treatment delays.  Patients will continue 
scanning regardless of treatment delays until radiographic disease progression per 
RECIST v1.1 (or loss of clinical benefi t for patients who continue study treatment after 
disease progression per RECIST v1.1), withdrawal of consent, death, or study 
termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first.  
Patients in the experimental arm who are treated beyond disease progression per 
RECIST v1.1 will undergo tumor assessments at the frequency described above 
(i.e., every 6  weeks [ 7 days]  for the first 48  weeks  and every 9 weeks [ 7 days]  after 
48 weeks) until s tudy treatment is discontinued.  
Patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other than radiographic disease 
progression per RECIST v1.1 (e.g., toxicity, symptomatic deterioration) will continue 
scheduled tumor assessments at the frequency described above until radiographic 
disease pro gression per RECIST v1.1, withdrawal of consent, death, or study 
termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first.  In the absence of radiographic 
disease progression per RECIST v1.1, tumor assessments should continue regardless 
of whether a patient star ts a new  anti-cancer therapy.  
Response will be assessed according to RECIST v1.1 (see Appendix  3). 
During the study, patients will be asked to complete patient -reported outcome (PRO) 
survey s at the beginning of the study (i.e., Day 1 of Cycle 1 ), on Day 1 of each cycle 
after Day 1 of Cycle 1 , at treatment discontinuation, and during survival follow -up at 
3 and 6 months  (see Section  4.5.9  and Appendix  1).  Completion of PRO questionnaires 
will no longer be required  after the final OS analysis.  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
36/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  After study treatment discontinuation, survival follow -up information will be collected by 
means of telephone calls, patient medical records, and/or clinic visits approximately 
every 3 months or more frequently until death, loss to follow -up, or study term ination by 
the Sponsor, whichever occurs first (see Section 4.6.1 ).  All patients will be periodically 
contacted for survival and new anti -cancer therap y information unless the patient 
requests to be withdrawn from survival follow -up (this request must be documented in 
the source documents and signed by the investigator).   After completion of final OS 
analysis, patients will only need to be followed for 6  months after the last dose of study 
treatment  and i nformation on n ew anti -cancer therapy will no longer be  required .  If the 
patient withdraws from the study, study staff may use a public information source (e.g., 
county records) when permissible to obtain  information about survival status.  
3.1.1  Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will evaluate safety data and will 
review  the interim analysis for OS .  Sponsor affiliates will be excluded from iDMC 
membership .  The iDMC will follow a charter that outlines the iDMC roles and 
responsibilities and meeting frequencies.  
Unblinded safety data will be reviewed on a periodic basis, approximately every 
6 months or as needed from the time of enrollment of the first patient.   Unblinded 
efficacy data will be reviewed as part of an interim analysis  for OS  (see Section 6.10).  
All summaries and analyses for the iDMC review will be prepared by an external 
independent  Data Coordinating Center . 
After reviewing the data, the iDMC will provide a recommendation to the Sponsor as 
described in the iDMC Charter.  For the interim analysis  of OS, the iDMC will review the 
analysis results provided by the iDCC and will recommend or not recommend to unblind 
the study to the Sponsor.   Final decisions will rest with the Sponsor.   Details will be 
specified in the iDMC charter . 
Any outcomes of the se data reviews that affect study conduct will be communicated in a 
timely manner to the investigators for notification of their respective Institutional Review 
Boards/Ethics Committees  (IRBs/ECs) . 
3.2 END OF STUDY  AND LENGTH OF STUDY  
The end of this study wil l occur wh en all of the following criteria have been met:  
 The required number of deaths for the final analys is of OS has been observed 
(see Section  6.4.1 ) or the last data point required for safety follow -up is received, 
whichever occurs later . 
 The last patient ’s last visit has occurred.  
 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
37/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  In addition, the Sponsor may decide to terminate the stu dy at any time  and provide a 
written notification to investigators .  Patients may continue study treatment until the 
development of progressive disease,  unacceptable toxicity, patient consent withdrawal , 
or Sponsor ’s decision to terminate  the study , whichever occurs first .  If the Sponsor 
decides to end the study, patients still receiving study treatment may be offered 
participation in the continued access program or enrollment into another study for 
continued access to study treatment, if, in the opi nion of the investigator and in 
consultation with the Medical Monitor, the patient would potentially benefit from 
continuing therapy  and the patient cannot reasonably access the treatment outside of

The approximate total length of the study,  from screening of the first patient to the end of 
the study, is expected to be approximately 47 months . 
3.3 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN  
3.3.1  Rationale for Evaluating Cabozantinib in Combination with 
Atezolizumab in Metastatic NSCLC after Progression on Prior 
Platinum -Containing Chemotherapy and AntiPD-L1/PD -1 
Antibody  
As outlined in Section 1.3, in addition to multiple RTKs such as VEGFR2, MET, and 
RET, ca bozantinib also inhibits TYRO3, AXL, and MER (TAM family kinases).  The latter 
are implicated in promoting suppression of an antitumor immune response.  Preclinical 
studies (Kwilas et  al. 2014;  Song  et al. 2015;  Lu et al. 2017) and clinical observations on  
circulating immune suppressive cells and immune effector cells in patients  with cancer  
(Apolo et al. 2014) suggest that cabozantinib promotes an immune -permissive 
environment, which might present an opportunity for synergistic effects from combination 
treatment with antiPD-L1/PD -1 ICIs independent of PD -L1 expression.  
Cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab is currently being evaluated in a 
multi -cohort Phase Ib study in patients  with locally advanced or metastatic solid  tumors 
(COSMIC -021) (s ee the Cabozantinib Investigator's Brochure for more information ).  In 
Study COSMIC -021, encouraging clinical activity and tolerability of this combination was 
observed.  Thus, this combination  holds promise as a potential new treatment 
opportunity in patient s with metastatic NSCLC  who have limited treatment options  after 
failure of antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody  and platinum -containing  chemotherapy .   
This randomized, open -label, Phase III study of the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab  
in combination with cabozantinib  versus docetaxel monotherapy in patient s with 
metastatic NSCLC  who have progressed on prior platinum -containing chemotherapy and 
antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody  will test this hypothesis.  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
38/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  3.3.2  Rationale for Control Arm  
For patients with metastatic NSCLC,  after failure of initial systemic chemotherapy and 
antiPD-L1/PD -1 treatment (either sequentially or concurrently) , subsequent treatment 
options based on NCCN or ESMO guidelines  include  a) docetaxel;  b) pemetrexed; and 
c) docetaxel and ramucirumab.  Of these options, docetaxel is the most frequently used 
treatment option in this setting globally.  
Docetaxel is approved in the United States  as a single agent for locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC after platinum therapy failure and with cisplatin for unresectable, 
locally advanced or metastatic untreated NSCLC (Taxotere USPI ) and also approved in 
the European Union  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
NSCLC  after failure of prior chemotherapy (Taxotere  EMA SmPC).   
More re cently, the combination of docetaxel and ramucirumab was approved in the 
United States and the European Union for the second - and third -line treatment of 
metastatic NSCLC, based on the results of a large Phase III study comparing docetaxel 
and ramucirumab versus docetaxel monotherapy ( n  1253 patients).  The study 
demonstrated a modest increase in median PFS (4.5 vs. 3.0 months) and median OS 
(10.5 vs. 9.1 months) (Garon et al . 2014).  This modest improvement in efficacy wa s 
seen in both squamous and non squamous histologies.  
Currently , docetaxel monotherapy continues to be widely used in this patient population.  
Several recent randomized Phase III trials in NSCLC in second - and third -line treatment 
of patient s with metastatic NSCLC have been designed wi th docetaxel as the active 
control arm (Borghaei et al . 2015; Herbst et al . 2016; Rittmeyer et  al. 2017).  Thus, 
based on the global treatment landscape, docetaxel will be used as the comparator in 
this s tudy.   
3.3.3  Rationale for Study Treatment Dose Selection and Treatment 
Schedule  
3.3.3.1  Rationale for Atezolizumab  Dose and Schedule  
Atezolizumab will be administered at a fixed dose of 1200 m g Q3W (1200 mg on Day  1 
of each 21 -day cycle), which is an approved dos e regimen  for atezolizumab 
(Tecentriq  USPI ) in NSCLC , and this atezolizumab dose regimen is also currently being 
evaluated in the Phase Ib study  (COSMIC -021) of atezolizumab and cabozantinib .  
Anti-tumor activity has been observed across doses ranging from 1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg 
Q3W.  In Study PCD4989g, the ma ximum tolerated dose of atezolizumab was not 
reached and no DLTs were observed at any dose.  The fixed dose of 1200 mg Q3W 
(equivalent to an average body weight -based dose of 15  mg/kg Q3W) was selected on 
the basis of both nonclinical studies (Deng  et al. 2016) and available clinical PK, 
efficacy, and safety data (refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for details).  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
39/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  3.3.3.2  Rationale for Cabozantinib Dose and Schedule  
In this Phase III study, the starting cabozantinib dose will be 40 mg QD based on results 
from the ongoing Phase Ib study (COSMIC -021) evaluating atezolizumab in combination 
with cabozantinib ( Section  1.4).  In the Phase Ib study, a total of 12 patients with 
adva nced RCC were evaluated in the d ose-escalation stage  at the 40 -mg or 60-mg 
cabozantinib dose level ( 6 patients each) plus the standard dose of atezolizumab.  After 
reviewing all available s afety and efficacy data of the d ose-escalation s tage, the Cohort 
Review Committee deter mined that cabozantinib 40 mg QD  orally in combination with 
1200 mg atezolizumab Q3W  IV is the recommended dose for the e xpansion -stage 
combination -therapy cohorts.  The Cohort Review Committee de cision was based on the 
favorable safety profile of the 40 -mg cabozantinib dose level over a prolonged time on 
study treatment with less frequent dose reductions and encouraging preliminary efficacy, 
which was  deemed to optimize the benefit risk of the com bination  therapy  in multiple 
solid tumor expansion cohorts including an NSCLC cohort . 
The lower 40 -mg dose of cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab is further 
supported by an exposure -response analysis of safety and efficacy endpoints from 
cabozant inib monotherapy data in the METEOR trial in 2L RCC evaluating 60 -mg 
cabozantinib versus  everolimus (Lacy et al . 2018).  Dose reductions to 40 mg and then 
20 mg were allowed and occurred in 62% of patients in the cabozantinib group.  The 
60-mg exposure was  associated wi th a higher risk for selected adverse event s including 
PPE (Grade  1), fatigue/ast henia (Grade  3), hyperten sion (systolic blood 
pressure  160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure   100 mmHg) , and diarrhea 
(Grade   3), with predicted HRs of 1.49, 1.42, 1.36, and 1.33, respectively, relative to the 
predicted average steady -state cabozantinib concentration for a 40 -mg starting dose.   
While the efficacy was somewhat lower with a 40 -mg monotherapy dose compared to 
the 60 -mg dose (higher risk of disease progression/death (HR   1.1), lower maximal 
median reduction in tumor size ( 9.1% vs . 11.9%) and lower ORR (15.6 % vs . 19.1%), 
the benefit risk in combination with atezolizumab based on the dose-escalation stage  of 
the COSMIC -021 Phase Ib study favored the lower 40 -mg cabozantinib dose, 
considering the potential overlapping adverse event s of the two agents . 
3.3.4  Rationale for Patient Population  and Analysis Groups  
There is a significant unmet need in patients with metastatic NSCLC who have 
progressed following prior platinum -containing chemotherapy and antiPD-L1/PD -1 
antibody  either in combination or in sequence .  Currently, single -agent chemotherapy is 
the main tr eatment option available to these patients but has modest activity as 
described above.  Both atezolizumab and cabozantinib have shown single -agent activity 
in multiple tumor types , including NSCLC.  Moreover, atezolizumab is approved as 
monotherapy for pat ients with metastatic NSCLC who have disease progression during 
or following platinum -containing chemotherapy (Tecentriq USPI), or as monotherapy for 
the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior 
chemotherapy (Tecent riq SmPC).   The encouraging observed clinical activity and 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
40/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  tolerability of this combination hold promise as a potential new treatment opportunity in 
patients  with metastatic NSCLC who ha ve progressed on prior platinum -containing 
chemotherapy and antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody .  This randomized, open -label, Phase III 
study of the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab  in combination with cabozantinib versus  
docetaxel monotherapy in patients  with metastatic NSCLC who have progressed on 
prior platinum -containing c hemotherapy and antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody  will test this 
hypothesis.   Patients whose tumors have EGFR  mutations  or ALK translocation  for 
which targeted therapy is approved are excluded irrespective of whether such therapy 
has previously been given.  
3.3.5  Rationa le for Open -Label Study   
An open -label study design was chosen for this trial , and this allows for adequate side 
effect management g iven the different toxicit y profiles associated with each study drug .  
Furthermore, a blinded study would require administration of IV placebo , which could 
pose additional burden to patients.  Finally, because of the potential for 
pseudoprogression in patients randomized to the experimental arm, a blinded study 
would require all patients to continue treatment until lo ss of clinical benefit regardless of 
the arm to which they are randomized.  This could then delay subsequent treatment with 
approved therapies, as well as increase the complexity of treatment decisions for 
patients on the docetaxel arm.  
3.3.6  Rationale for Treat ment beyond Initial Radiographic 
Progression  per RECIST v1.1  
Conventional response criteria may not adequately assess the activity of  
immunotherapeutic agents because progressive disease  (PD) (by initial radiographic  
evaluation) may not necessarily reflect  therapeutic failure.  Because of the potential for  
pseudoprogression and/or tumor immune infiltration, this study will allow patients  
randomized to receive atezolizumab plus cabozantinib to continue to receive study 
treatment after apparent radiographic progression, provided the benefit risk ratio is 
judged to be favorable  (see criteria in Section  3.1).  Patients should be discontinued for 
unacceptab le toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression as 
determined by the investigator after an integrated assessment of radiographic data, 
biopsy results (if available), and clinical status . 
3.3.7  Rationale for Biomarker Assessments   
Publi shed results suggest that the expression of PD -L1 in tumors correlates with 
response to anti PD-1 and antiPD-L1 therapy (Topalian et al. 2012 ; Herbst et al. 2014 ; 
Borghaei et al. 2015; Fehrenbacher et al. 2016; Herbst et al. 2016 ; Rosenberg et al. 
2016 ).  In the current  study , any tumor samples collected will be tested for PD -L1 
expression by a central laboratory.   In addition to the assessment of PD -L1 status, other 
exploratory biomarkers, such as potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers related 
to the clinical benefit and safety of atezolizumab  and cabozantinib , tumor 
immunobiology, mechanisms of resistance, or tumor type, may be analyzed.   DNA 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
41/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  and/or RNA extraction and  analysis may be performed to enable next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) , includi ng but not limited to whole exome sequencing (WES) , to 
evaluate expression of genes to  assess their association with efficacy , and to identify 
somatic mutations to increase  understanding of disease pathobiology.  Methods for the 
biomarker analysis ma y also include, but are not limited to, digital polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR), quan titative reverse transcription PCR, and  proteomics -based 
approaches.  
Fresh tumor biopsy, when clinically feasible, is preferred.  Tumor tissue will also be 
collected at the time  of first evidence of radiographic disease progression per 
RECIST  v1.1, if deemed clinically feasible  by the investigator , to enable analysis of 
tumor tissue biomarkers related  to resistance, disease progression, and clinical benefit 
of atezolizumab . 
Blood -based biomarkers (including, but not limited to,  circulating tumor DNA [ctDNA])  
may be also evalua ted and correlated with Atezo   Cabo efficacy and evaluated as 
surrogate markers of effi cacy.  This evaluation of  blood -based markers may provide 
eviden ce for biologic activity of Atezo   Cabo in patients with NSCLC, help to identify 
patients w ho may benefit most from Atezo   Cabo , and help future development of 
tissue -free diagnostic options for  patients who have  inadequate quality or insufficient 
quanti ty of tumor tissue for biomarker testing.  
Blood samples will be collected in order to better  understand the changes in 
blood -based biomarker profiles and potential mechanisms of  resistance upon 
progression.  Blood samples may also be evaluated for additional  exploratory 
biomarkers that may be associated with the therapeutic effects of  Atezo   Cabo or the 
pathogenesis of NSCLC.  
Tissue samples will be collected for DNA extraction to enable WES to identify variants 
that are predictive of response to s tudy drug s, are associated with progression to a more 
severe disease state,  are associated with acquired resistance to study drug, are 
associated with susceptibility to developing adverse events, can lead to improved 
adverse event monitoring or investigati on, or can increase the knowledge and 
understanding of disease biology and drug safety.  Genomics is increasingly informing 
researcher's understanding of disease pathobiology.  WES provide s a comprehensive 
characterization of the exome and , along with clin ical data collected in this study, may 
increase the opportunity for developing new therapeutic approaches or new methods for 
monitoring efficacy and safety or predicting which patients are more likely to respond to 
a drug or develop adverse events.  Data w ill be analyzed in the context of this study but 
may also be explored in aggregate with data from other studies.  The availability of a 
larger dataset will assist in identification and characterization of important biomarkers 
and pathways to support future  drug development.  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
42/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  3.3.8  Rationale for Patient -Reported  Assessments   
In the treatment of lung cancer, it is important to both increase survival and minimize  
symptoms by delaying progression because symptoms have negative impacts on 
patients’ functioning including health -related quality of life (HRQoL ) (Hyde and Hyde 
1974 ; Hopwood and Stephens 1995 ; Sarna et al. 2004 ).  Patients are uniquely qualified 
to report their symptom severity and how it impacts their daily functioning and overall 
QoL.  Therefore , PROs will complement traditional evaluation of survival and tumor 
progression ( see Section 2.1.2 ).  In addition, many of the most frequent adverse events  
attributed to atezolizumab, cabozantinib, or docetaxel (e.g., fatigue, rash, nausea) are 
symptoms directly reportable by patients; therefore, patients’ reporting of their 
experience with these symptoms will complement the evaluation of treatment tolerabil ity 
(King -Kallimanis et al. 2019).  
This study includes use of validated patient -reported measures of symptom severity and 
symptom impact on functioning including HRQoL :  the EORTC QLQ -C30; its 
lung-specific module EORTC QLQ -LC13; and  selected scales  from the PRO -CTCAE 
item library to reflect known experience receiving atezolizumab, cabozantinib, and 
docetaxel , including one -item EORTC IL46  to document overall treatment burden.   Data 
generated from these questionnaires  will inform patients’ experience  with disease 
burden and treatment tolerability as part of the totality of eviden ce generated to inform 
the riskbenefit of atezolizumab and cabozantinib.  
Although the patients will not be blinded to their treatment, to date, upon examination of 
open -label  studies, there is no empirical evidence that assessor bias is of such 
magnitude as to alter the findings particularly when ratings are on specific concepts as 
symptoms severity and symptoms interference with daily functioning (Atkinson et al. 
2017; Roydho use et al.  2019).  
The EQ -5D-5L is also included in this study to generate utility scores for use in economic 
models for reimbursement.   
3.3.9  Rationale for Stratificati on Factors  
To balance key clinical risk factors between the two treatment arms, randomizatio n will 
be stratified as follows:  
 Histology :  squam ous vs. non squamous  
 Prior NSCLC treatment regimen (s) at the following four levels:  
1. Patients who have received concurrent p latinum -containing chemotherapy and 
antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody  combination  
2. Patients who have received p latinum -containing  chemotherapy  first, disease 
progression occurs , followed by antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
43/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  3. Patients who have received antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody  monotherapy first,  
disease progression occurs,  followed by platinum -containing chemotherapy  
without anti -PD-L1/PD -1 antibody  
4. Patients who have received antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody  monotherapy first,  
disease  progression occurs, followed by  continued anti -PD-L1/PD -1 antibody in 
combination with  platinum -containing chemotherapy added on  
 
The rationale for including each of these stratification factors is described below.  
Histology  
Since antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibod ies appear to be equally effic acious in both squamous 
and non squamous histologies, this study will allow patie nts with either squamo us or 
nonsquamous NSCLC to be enrolled.  However, it is well documented that median OS is 
shorter in  patients with  metastatic  NSCLC w ith squamous histology than non squamous 
histology.  Therefore, histology is selected as a stratification factor to minimize  any 
imbalance in these subgroups.  
Prior NSCLC  Treatment  Regimen s 
A number of factors  relating to prior NSCLC regimen may be associated with differing 
clinical outcomes, including the number , order of prior lines of therapy , and last type of 
therapy type r eceived.   
For example, patients who have progressed on platinum -containing chemotherapy 
followed by antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody  (two prior lines of therapy ) may have poorer 
outcomes than  patients who have progressed on prior antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody  and 
platinum -containing chem otherapy in combination (i.e.,  one prior line of therapy ) on the 
basis of  having failed more lines of treatment.  For example, in the 2L/3L NSCLC OAK 
study (Rittmeyer et al. 2017), 2L patients had better OS outcome than 3L patients (OS 
HR of 0.71 in 2L vs. 0.80 in 3L, in favor of atezolizumab).   
In addition to the number of pr ior regimens, proximity to last  antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody  
treatment may correlate with outcomes as any intervening therapy may impact observed 
efficacy associated with re -challenge.   
Given the uncertainty regarding the  underlying biology including mechanis ms of 
resistance for antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody  refractory versus  antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody  
resistant NSCLC, sequencing of  therapy, and last type of therapy ; a multi -factor 
stratification factor will be used to maintain balance between study arms . 
Stratificat ion on all permutations of when and in what combination prior antiPD-L1/PD -1 
antibody was received  will minimize  potential imbalances that may impact efficacy with 
re-challenge with an antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody .

46/Protocol GO41892, Version 5   For women of childbearing potential:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from 
heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception, and agreement to refrain from 
donating eggs, as defined below:  
Women must remain abstinent or use two methods of contraception, including 
at least one method with a failure rate of  1% per year, during the treatment 
with atezolizumab in combination with cabozantinib  in the experimental arm or 
during the treatment wit h docetaxel in the control arm, and for 5  months after 
the final dose of atezolizumab and/or 4 months after the final dose of 
cabozantinib, whichever is later .  Women must refrain from donating eggs 
during this same period.  
A woman is considered to be of c hildbearing potential if she is postmenarch al, 
has not reached a postmenopausal state (  12 continuous months of 
amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and is not 
permanently infertile due to surgery (i.e., removal of ovaries, fallopian  tubes, 
and/or uterus) or another cause as determined by the investigator 
(e.g.,  Müllerian agenesis) .  Per this definition, a woman with a tubal ligation is 
considered to be of childbearing potential.   The definition of childbearing 
potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or regulations.  
Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of  1% per year include 
bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit 
ovulation, hormone -releasing intra uterine devices, and copper intrauterine 
devices.   The recommended highly effective methods of contraception are 
defined in  Appendix  8. 
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not a dequate methods of contraception.  
If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized adequate 
methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will 
be described in the local Informed Consent Form.  
 For men:  agr eement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or 
use contraceptive methods, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as 
defined below:  
With a female partner of childbearing potential who is not pregnant, men who 
are not surgically  sterile must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an 
additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of  1% per 
year during the treatment with atezolizumab in combination with cabozantinib in 
the experimental arm or during the tre atment with docetaxel in the control arm, 
and for 4 months after the final dose of cabozantinib , or for 6  months after the 
final dose of docetaxel.   Men must refrain from donating sperm during this 
same period.  
With a pregnant female partner, men must rema in abstinent or use a condom 
during the treatment with atezolizumab in combination with cabozantinib in the 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
47/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  experimental arm or d uring the treatment with docetaxel in the control arm, and 
for 4 months after the final dose of cabozantinib  to avoid exposing the embryo . 
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized acceptable 
methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will 
be described in the local I nformed Consent Form.

4.2 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT AND BLIND ING  
4.2.1  Treatment Assignment  
This is a randomized, open -label study.  After written informed consent has been 
obtained,  the study site will ac cess the interactive voice or web -based response system 
(IxRS) to obtain the patient screening number.  After  all screening procedures and 
assessments have been completed, and eligibility has been established for a patient, the 
study site will obtain the patient's enrollment identification number and treatment 
assignment from IxRS.  
Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:  Experimental arm 
(atezolizumab 1200 mg IV  Q3W   cabozantinib 40 mg PO QD) or control arm (docetaxel 
75 mg/m² IV Q3W ).  Randomization will occur in a 1:1 ratio using a permuted -block 
randomization method to ensure a balanced assignment to each treatment arm.  
Randomization will be stratified by the following factors : 
 Histology ( nonsquamous vs. squamous)  
 Prior NSCLC treatment regimen(s) at the following four levels:  
1. Concurrent platinum -containing chemotherapy and antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody 
combination  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
53/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  2. Platinum -containing chemotherapy first, disease progression occurs, followed 
by antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody   
3. AntiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody monotherap y first,  disease progression occurs,  
followed by platinum -containing chemotherapy  without anti -PD-L1/PD -1 
antibody  
4. AntiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody monotherapy first, disease progression occurs , 
followed by continued anti -PD-L1/PD -1 antibody in combination  with platinum -
containing chemotherapy added on  
 
Patients should receive their first dose of study drug on the day of randomization if 
possible. If this is not possible, the first dose should occur within 3 days after 
randomization.  
4.2.2  Blinding  
Although this is an  open label study, the study team at the Sponsor consisting of clinical, 
statistical, statistical programming, data management, and other study personnel, will be 
blinded to the randomized treatment assignment by IxRS.   
The study team will not be allowed t o perform analyses or summaries generated by 
randomized treatment assignment and/or actual treatment received before the 
randomized treatment assignment for all randomized patients is disclosed to the study 
team  for the prespecified analysis.

while on study, refer to  Appendix  7.  
Accepted clinical guidelines regarding appropriate management while receiving 
any kind of anticoagulation therapy must be followed.   This includes, but is not 
limited to, subject education r egarding the potential adverse drug reactions, 
monitoring laboratory parameters, dose adjustments (e .g., due to kidney 
dysfunction).   Caution is warranted in settings associated with an increased risk 
for bleeding such as gastrointestinal cancers, urotheli al cancers, gastrointestinal 
mucosal abnormality (e .g., mucositis), renal or hepatic impairment, 
thrombocytopenia, arterial hypertension, or prior history of gastrointestinal 
bleed.   For direct factor Xa inhibitors, the potential for drug -drug interaction with 
other concomitant medications, as well as gastrointestinal absorption, should be 
considered.  Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs should not  be 
used concomitantly with heparin or factor Xa inhibitors due to the increased risk 
for bleeding  complications.  The risks and benefits of the use of anticoagulants 
should be reassessed on a regular basis.  For more information regarding the 
use of anticoagulants, refer to the prescribing information of the anticoagulant 
and accepted clinical practice guidelines.  
 Vaccinations (such as influenza, SARS -CoV-2) 
o Live, attenuated vaccines are not permitted (see  Section  4.4.7 ) 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
60/Protocol GO41892, Version 5   Megestrol acetate administered as an appetite stimulant  
 Mineralocorticoids (e.g.,  fludrocortisone)  
 Corticosteroids  adminis tered for COPD or asthma  
 Low-dose corticosteroids administered for orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical 
insufficiency  
 Palliative radiotherapy (e.g., treatment of known bony metastases or symptomatic 
relief of pain) as outlined below:  
Palliative radiotherapy is permitted, provided it does not interfere with the 
assessment of tumor target lesions (e.g., the lesion to be irradiated must not be 
the only site of measurable disease).  Treatment with atezolizumab, 
cabozantinib , and docetaxel  may be continued during palliative radiotherapy.  
 
Premedication with antihistamines , antipyretics, and/or analgesics  may be administered 
for the second and subsequent atezolizumab infusions only, at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
In general, investigators should manage a patient's care (including preexisting 
conditions) with supportive therapies  other than those defined as cautionary or 
prohibited therapies (see Sections  4.4.2   4.4.7 ) as clinically  indicated, per local 
standard practice .  Patients who experience infusion -associated symptoms may be 
treated symptomatically with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or H 2-
receptor antagonist s (e.g.,  famotidine, cimetidine) , or equivalent medications  per local 
standard practice.  Serious infusion -associated  events manifested by dyspnea, 
hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or 
respiratory distress should be managed with supportive therapies as clinically indicated 
(e.g.,  supplemental oxygen and 2-adrenergic agonists; see  Appendix  5). 
4.4.2  Cautionary Therapy for All Patients  
4.4.2.1  Herbal Therapies  
Concomitant use of herbal therapies is not recommended because their 
pharmacokinetics, safety profiles, and potential drug drug interacti ons are generally 
unknown.  However, herbal therapies not intended for the treatment of cancer (see 
Section  4.4.3 ) may be used during the study at the discretion of the investigator.  
4.4.3  Cautionary Therapy for  Atezo lizumab -Treated Patients  
4.4.3.1  Corticosteroids , Immunosuppressive Medications,  and TNF - 
Inhibitors  
Systemic corticosteroids , immunosuppressive medications,  and TNF - inhibitors may 
attenuate potential beneficial immunologic effects of treatment with atezolizumab.  
Therefore, in situations in which systemic corticosteroids , immunosuppressive 
medications,  or TNF - inhibitors would be routinely administered, alternatives, including 
antihistamines, should be considered.  If the alternatives are not feasible, systemic 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
61/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  corticosteroids , immunosuppressive medications,  and TNF - inhibitors may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator.  
Systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications are recommended, at the 
discretion of the investigator , for the treatment of specific adverse events when 
associated with atezolizumab therapy  (refer to Appendix  6 for details).  
4.4.4  Cautionary Therapy  for Cabozantinib  Treated Patients  
4.4.4.1  Cytochrome P450  
Data from a clinical drug interaction study (XL184 -008) show that clinically relevant 
steady -state concentrations of cabozantinib appear to have no marked effect on the area 
under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of co -administered rosiglitazone, a 
CYP2C8 substrate.   Therefore, cabozantinib is not anticipated to markedly i nhibit 
CYP2C8 in the clinic, and , by inference, is not anticipated to markedly inhibit other 
CYP450 isozymes that have lower [I]/Ki values compared with CYP2C8 (i .e., CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4).   In vitro data indicate that cabozantinib i s 
unlikely to induce CYP enzymes, except for possible induction of CYP1A1 at high 
cabozantinib concentrations (30  μM).  
Cabozantinib is a CYP3A4 substrate and a weak substrate for CYP2C9 (but not a 
CYP2D6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, or CYP1A2 substrate), bas ed on data from in 
vitro studies.   Results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184 -006, showed that 
concurrent administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, 
resulted in an approximately 77% reduction in cabozantinib exposure (A UC values) after 
a single dose of cabozantinib in healthy volunteers.  Chronic co -administration of 
cabozantinib with strong inducers of the CYP3A4 family (e .g., phenytoin, 
carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort ) may 
significantly decrease cabozantinib concentrations.   The chronic use of strong CYP3A4 
inducers should be avoided.  Other drugs that induce CYP3A4 should be used with 
caution because these drugs have the potential to decrease exposure (i .e., AUC) to 
cabozantinib .  Caution must be used when discontinuing  treatment with a strong 
CYP3A4 inducer in a patient  who has been concurrently receiving a stable dose of 
cabozantinib, as this could significantly increase the exposure to cabozantinib.  Selection 
of alternate concomitant medications with no or minimal CYP3A4 enzyme induction 
potential is recommended.  
Results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184 -007, showed that concurrent 
administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazo le, resulted 
in a 38% increase in the cabozantinib exposure (AUC values) after a single dose of 
cabozantinib in healthy volunteers.   Co-administration of cabozantinib with strong 
inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e .g., boceprevir, conivaptan, posaconazole, 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, 
saquinavir, ritonavir, lopinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, and  voriconazole) may increase 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
62/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  cabozantinib concentrations.  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided and other 
drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 should be used with caution because these drugs have the 
potential to increase exposure (i .e., AUC) to cabozantinib.  Selection of alternate 
concomitant medications with no or minimal CYP3A4 enzyme inhibition potential i s 
recommended.  
Please refer to the drug interaction tables at the following website for lists of substrates, 
inducers, and inhibitors of selected CYP450 isozyme pathways:  
https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug -interactions -labeling/drug -development -and-drug-
interactions .  
4.4.4.2  Protein Binding  
Cabozantinib is highly bound (  99.7%) to human plasma proteins.  Therefore, highly 
protein bound drugs should be used with caution with cabozantinib because there is a 
potential displacement interaction that could increase free concentrations of 
cabozantinib and/or a co -administered highly protein -bound drug (and a corresponding 
increase in pharmacologic effect).  
4.4.4.3  Other Interactions  
Food may increase exposure levels of cabozantinib by 57% ; fasting recommendations 
(see Section 4.3.2.1 ) should be followed.  In vitro data suggest that cabozantinib is 
unlikely to be a substrate for P -glycoprotein, but it does appear to have the potential to 
inhibit the P -glycoprotein transport activity.  Therefore, cabozantinib may have the 
potential to increase plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of 
P-glycoprotein .  Patients  should be cautioned against  taking  a P-glycoprotein substrate  
(e.g., fexofenadine, aliskiren, ambrisentan, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, colchicine, 
maraviroc, posaconazole, ranolazine, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, talinolol, tolvaptan).   In 
addition,  cabozantinib was  shown to be a substrate of drug t ransporter multidrug 
resistance -associated protein 2 (MRP2) in an in vitro assay.  Administration of MRP2 
inhibitors may result in increases in cabozantinib plasma concentrations.  Therefore, 
concomitant use of MRP2 inhibi tors (e .g., cyclosporine, efavirenz, emtricitabine) should 
be approached with caution.  Additional details related to these overall conclusions can 
be found in the investigator brochure.  
Bile salt -sequestering agents such as cholestyramine and cholestagel may interact with 
cabozantinib and may impact absorption (or reabsorption) resulting in potentially 
decreased exposure and should be avoided.  
Administration of the proton -pump inhibitor esomeprazole resulted in no clinically -
relevant effect on cabozantinib  plasma PK in healthy volunteers.  Therefore, concomitant 
use of gastric pH modifying agents (i .e., proton -pump inhibitors , H2 receptor antagonists, 
and antacids) is not contraindicated in patient s administered cabozantinib.  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
63/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  Additional details  regarding potential drug interactions with cabozantinib can be found in 
the Cabozantinib Investigator’s Brochure.  
4.4.5  Cautionary Therapy for Docetaxel -Treated Patients  
Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate.  Patients randomized to receive docetaxel must avoid 
using concomitan t strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telithromycin and voriconazole).   There are no clinical data with a dose adjustment in 
patients receiving st rong CYP3A4 inhibitors.  
In addition, concomitant treatment with CYP3A4 inducers may decrease plasma 
concentrations of docetaxel.  Therefore, concomitant medications that are CYP3A4 
inducers should be used with caution.  
Granulocyte colony -stimulating fact or treatment is permitted for patients in the docetaxel 
arm.  The primary prophylaxis should be administered per the American Soc iety of 
Clinical Oncology , EORTC, and ESMO  guideline s; namely, in patients who 
are   60 years of age and/or with comorbidities (Smith et al. 2006; Crawford et al. 2009; 
Aapro et al. 2011).  
Anti-emetics, anti -allergic measures, and other treatments for concomitant docetaxel 
toxicities may be used at the discretion of the investigator, taking into account 
precautions from the Summary of Product Characteristics.  
See the Summary of Product Characteristics for docetaxel for all boxed warnings and 
contraindications.   
4.4.6  Prohibited  Therapies  for All Patients  
Use of the following concomitant therapies is prohibited  for all patien ts: 
 Concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer (including, but not limited 
to, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and herbal 
therapy), whether health authority approved or experimental, is  prohibited for 
various time periods prior to starting study treatment, depe nding on the agent (see 
Section  4.4), and during study treatment, until disease progression is documented 
and the patient has discontinued study treatment (see Section  4.6.2 , with the 
exception of palliative radiotherapy).  
 Any i nvestigational therapy or investigational medical device is prohibited within 
4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment and during study treatment . 
 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
64/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  4.4.7  Prohibited Therapies for Atezoli zumab-Treated and 
Cabozantinib -Treated Patients 
Use of the following concomitant therapies is prohibited  for patie nts treated with 
atezoli zumab  and cabozantinib:  
 Live, attenuated vaccine s (e.g.,  FluMist, intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, 
rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines ) are 
prohibited within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment , during atezolizumab 
treatment , and for 5 months  after the final dose of atezoliz umab .  
 Systemic i mmunostimulatory  agents ( including , but not limited to , interferons and 
IL-2) are prohibited within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug  (whichever is longer ) 
prior to initiation of study treatment and during study treatment  because these 
agents could potentially increase the risk for autoimmune conditions when given in 
combination with atezolizumab.  
 Oral anti -coagulation with coumarin agents (e.g., warfarin), direct thrombin inhibitor 
dabigatran, direct factor Xa inhibitor betrixaban, plat elet inhibitors (e.g., clopidogrel), 
and chronic use of aspirin above low -dose levels for cardioprotection per local 
applicable guidelines), until 4  weeks after cabozantinib has been permanently 
discontinued (for permitted anti -coagulants, refer to Section  4.4.1 . 
 Concomitant medications known to prolong the QTc interval should be avoided in 
patient s who receive cabozantinib until they hav e permanently discontinued 
cabozantinib treatment (refer to http://www.qtdrugs.org for a list of drugs which have 
the potential to prolong the QTc interval).  
 
4.4.8  Prohibited Food  for Cabozantinib -Treated Patients   
Use of the following foods is prohibited as described below:  
 Consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice and  potent CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitor s 
is prohibited during the treatment with cabozantinib . 
 
4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS   
The schedule of activities to be performed during the study is provided in Appendix  1.  
All activities should be performed and documented for each patient.   
Patients will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability t hroughout the study.  
Patients should be assessed for toxicity prior to each dose; dosing will occur only if the 
clinical assessment and local laboratory test values are acceptable.  
At applicable sites, certain study assessments may be performed by a mobile nursing 
(MN) professional at the patient's home to improve access and convenience for patients 
participating in the study.   The Sponsor will select a healthcare company that will be 
responsible for providing MN services for participating sites (the MN vendor).  The MN 
vendor is responsible for ensuring that all MN professionals are licensed, qualified, and 
in good standing, as per applicable regulations, and that appropriate background checks 
have been performed.  If the investigator at a participati ng site determines that MN 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
65/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  services are appropriate for a patient and the patient gives written informed consent to 
participate in MN visits, the MN network will communicate with the patient and the 
patient's site.  MN visits will be scheduled on specified  visit days, to allow for relevant 
assessments to be performed by the MN professional, but will not include study drug 
infusions, which must be performed at the study site.  The schedules of activities (see 
Appendix  1 and Appendix  2) will specify the assessments that may be pe rformed by an 
MN professional for patients in either arm.   Investigators should ensure adequate clinical 
oversight.  
4.5.1  Informed Consent Forms and Screening Log  
Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before 
performing any  study-related procedures  (including screening evaluations) .  Informed 
Consent Forms for enrolled patients and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled 
will be maintained at the study site.  
Evaluations  (e.g., tumor imaging)  performed as part of routine care prior to informed 
consent can be utilized as screening evaluations if permitted by the site’s IRB/EC 
policies.   Informed consent may be obtained greater tha n 28 days before randomization.  
All screening evaluations must be  completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet 
all eligibility criteria before enrollment .  Certain laboratory values must be obtained closer 
to randomization , within 14 days.  The investigator will maintain a screening log to record 
details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening 
failure, as applicable.  
4.5.2  Medical History , Baseline Conditions, Concomitant Medication,  
and Demographic Data  
Medical history , including  clinically significant diseases, surgeries, c ancer history 
(including prior cancer therapies and procedures), reproductive status, smoking 
history  and use of alcohol  and drugs of abuse , will be recorded  at baseline .  Prior  PD-L1 
testing and  results will also be recorded  in the eCRF .  In addition, all medications 
(e.g.,  prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic 
remedies, nutritional supplements) used by the patient within 7 days prior to initiation of 
study treatment  will be recorded.   At the time of ea ch follow -up physical examination, an 
interval medical history should be obtained and any changes in medications and 
allergies should be recorded.  
Demographic data will include age at informed consent , sex, and self -reported 
race/ethnicity.  
4.5.3  Physical Examin ations  
A complete physical examination , performed at screening and other specified visits, 
should include an evaluation of the skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, the 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
66/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  cardiovascular, dermatologic , musculoskeletal, respiratory, GI, genitourinary, blood and 
lymphatic, and neurologic  systems.  Any abnormality identified at baseline should be 
recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  
Limited, symptom -directed physical examinations should be performed predose at 
specified postbaseline visits and as clinically indicated.  Changes from baseline 
abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  New  or worsened clinically significant 
abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Refer to Appendix  1 for the schedule of physical examination and performance status 
assessments .   
4.5.4  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include measurements of respiratory rate, pulse rate, systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure, and temperature.   Record abnormalities observed at baseline 
on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  At subsequent visits, 
record new or worsened clinically significa nt abnormalities on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
For the first infusion, v ital signs should be measured within 60 minutes prior to each 
atezolizumab  and docetaxel  infusio n, after the infusion of atezolizumab but prior to the 
administration of cabozantinib , and, if clinically indicated, during or after the infusion  as 
indicated in the schedule of activities ( Appendix  1).  If the patient experienced an 
infusio n-related reaction with the previous infusion or if clinically indicated, vital signs 
should be measured every 15  ( 5) minutes  during the infusion and at 30 ( 10) minutes 
after the infusion.  In addition, vital signs should be measured at other specified 
timepoints as outlined in the schedule of activities (see Appendix  1).   
4.5.5  Tumor and Response Evaluations  
Screening assessments and subsequent tumor assessments must include CT scans 
(with oral or IV contrast)  of chest , abdomen , and pelvis .  If a CT scan with contrast is 
contraindicated ( e.g., in patients with impaired renal cleara nce), a non -contrast CT scan 
of the chest may be performed , and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) scan s of the 
abdomen  and pelvis  should be performed.    
A CT scan with contrast or MRI scan of the head must also be done at screening to 
evaluate CNS metastasis in all patients (MRI scan must be performed if CT scan is 
contraindicated).  An MRI scan of the head is required to confirm or refute the diagnosis 
of CNS metastases at baseline in the event of an equivocal CT scan.   Bone scans and 
CT scans of  the neck should also be performed if clinically indicated  at screening .   
If a CT scan for tumor assessment is performed in a po sitron emission tomography /CT 
scanner, the CT acquisition must be consistent with the standards for a full -contrast 
diagnostic CT  scan.  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
67/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  Tumor assessments performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent 
and within 28 days of Day  1 of Cycle 1 may be used rather  than repeating tests.  All 
known sites of disease, including measurable and/or non -measurable disease , must  be 
documented at screening and re -assessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.  At 
subsequent (post -screening) tumor assessments , patients with a history of irradiat ed 
brain metastasis at screening are not required to undergo brain scan unless clinically  
indicated.  The same radiographic modality (e.g. , CT scan with contrast) and procedures 
(e.g., the same contrast protocol for CT scans) used to assess disease sites at 
screening should be used for subsequent tumor assessments.  
Patients will undergo tumor assessments at baseline , every 6 weeks (  7 days)  for the 
first 48  weeks following Day 1 of Cycle 1 , and every 9 weeks ( 7 days) after  completion 
of the Week 48 tumor assessment  regardless of treatment delays .  Patients will continue 
scanning regardless of treatment delays until radiographic disease progression per 
RECIST v1.1 (or loss of clinical benefit for patients who continue study treatment after 
disease progression per RECIST v1.1), withdrawal of consent, death, or study 
termination by the Sponsor,  whichever occurs first.  At the investigator’s discretion, 
scans may be performed at any time if PD or loss of clinical benefit is su spected .  
Patients in the experimental arm who are treated beyond disease progression per 
RECIST v1.1 will continue to undergo tumor assessments at the frequency described 
above (i.e., every 6 weeks (  7 days)  for the first 48  weeks  and every 9 weeks ( 7 days) 
after 48 weeks) until study treatment is discontinued.  
See Figure  2 for representation of on -study scan frequency
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
69/Protocol GO41892 , Version 5  Patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other than radiographic disease 
progression per RECIST v1.1 (e.g., toxicity, symptomatic deterioration) will continue 
scheduled tumor assessments at the frequency described above until radiographic 
disease pro gression per RECIST v1.1, withdrawal of consent, death, or study 
termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first.  In the absence of radiographic 
disease progression per RECIST v1.1, tumor assessments should continue regardless 
of whether a patient star ts a new anti -cancer therapy.   
A RECIST v1.1 PD -tumor assessment must be performed in both study  arms and tumor 
assessments must be continued until treatment discontinuation  for patients who receive 
treatment beyond progression  in the experimental  arm.  This includes continued 
measurement of target lesions, evaluation of non -target lesions (including monitoring for 
further worsening of any non -target lesions that have shown unequivocal progression), 
and evaluation of any newly identified lesions at all sub sequent assessments.   
Objective response at a single timepoint will be determined by the  investigator according 
to RECIST v1.1 (see  Appendix  3).  Assessments should be performed by the same 
evaluator, if possible, to ensure internal consistency across visits .  
4.5.6  Survival Assessments  
OS follow -up information will be collected via telephone ca lls, patient medical records, 
and/or clinic visits every 3 months (every 12 weeks [  7 days]) or more frequently until 
death, loss to follow -up, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first.  All 
patients will be periodically contacted for survival and new anti -cancer therapy 
information unless the patient requests to be wit hdrawn from the survival follow -up (this 
request must be documented in the source documents and signed by the investigator).  
After completion of final OS analysis, patients will only need to be followed for 
6 months after the last dose of study treatment and information on new  anti-cancer 
therapy information will no longer be required.   If the patient specifically withdraws from 
survival follow -up, the study staff may use a public information source  (e.g., county 
records), per local regulations, to obtain information about survival status only.  
See Appendix  1 for the schedule of follow -up assessments.  
4.5.7  Laboratory , Biomarker, and Other Biolo gical Samples  
Samples for the following laboratory tests will be sent to the study site's local laboratory 
for analysis:  
 Hematology:  WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, and 
differential count (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils,  monocytes, lymphocytes , 
other cells [if applicable ]) 
 Chemistry panel (serum or plasma):  bicarbonate or total carbon dioxide (if 
considered standard of care for the region), sodium, potassium, magnesium, 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
70/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  chloride, glucose, BUN or urea, creatinine, total  protein, albumin, phosphate , 
calcium, total bilirubin, ALP, ALT, AST, and LDH 
 Coagulation:  INR  and aPTT  
 Thyroid function testing:  thyroid -stimulating hormone, free triiodothyronine  (T3) (or 
total T3 for s ites where free T3 is not performed) , and free thyroxine  (also known 
as free T4) 
 HIV serology   
 HBV serology:  HBsAg, total HBcAb, and (if HBsAg test is negative and total HBcAb 
test is positive) HBV DNA  
If a patient has a negative HBsAg test and a positive  total HBcAb test at 
screening, an HBV DNA test must also be performed to determine if the patient 
has an HBV infection.   HBV DNA test must be negative.  
 HCV serology:  HCV antibody and (if HCV antibody test is positive) HCV RNA  
If a patient has a positive HCV antibody test at screening, an HCV RNA test 
must also be performed to determine if the patient has an HCV infection  
 Pregnancy test  
All women of childbearing potential will have a serum pregnancy test at 
screening.  Urine pregnancy tests will be perform ed at every cycle during study 
treatment, at treatment discontinuation, and as clinically indicated.  If a urine 
pregnancy test is positive, it must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test . 
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is pos tmenarch al, 
has not reached a postmenopausal state (  12 continuous months of 
amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and is not 
permanently infertile due to surgery (i.e., removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes, 
and/or uterus) or another c ause as determined by the investigator 
(e.g.,  Müllerian agenesis ).  Per this definition, a woman with a tubal ligation is 
considered to be of childbearing potential .  The definition of childbearing 
potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or regulations.   
 Urine Chemistry (Protein [spot urine  or 24 -hour collection ; fully quantitative]; 
Creatinine [spot urine; fully quantitative]; Urine protein/creat inine ratio [spot urine])  
 Urinalysis (pH, specific gravity, glucose , protein, ketones, and blood); dipstick 
permitted  
 
The following samples will be sent to  one or several central laboratories or to the 
Sponsor  or a designee for analysis:  
 Serum sample for analysis of C-reactive protein  
 Serum samples for atezolizumab PK analysis through use of  a validated assay  
 Plasma  samples for cabozantinib PK analysis  through use of  a validated assay  
 Serum samples for assessment of ADAs to atezolizumab through use of a validated 
assay  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
71/Protocol GO41892, Version 5   Blood, plasma, and serum samples for exploratory biomarker research , including 
biomarker assay development  
Blood samples may be processed to obtain plasma, serum, PBMCs , and other 
derivatives (e.g., RNA, DNA, etc.).  
 Representative fresh and archival tumor tissue sample obtained at baseline for  
exploratory research on biomarkers (e.g., PD -L1 status via central testing) , including 
biomarker assay development .  Tumor tissue samples should be submitted before 
or within 4 w eeks of randomization.   
If obtaining representative fresh tumor is not clinically feasible, representative 
archival tumor specimen is acceptable.  
Representative formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded tumor specimens in a 
paraffin block (preferred) or slides  (preferably 15 or more)  containing unstained, 
freshly cut, serial sections should be submitted along with an associated 
pathology report .  If 15 s lides are not available, fewer can be submitted.   A 
minimum of 5 slides is required for central PD -L1 testing.  
Tumor tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable tumor content.   
Samples must contain tumor cells that preserve cellular context and 
tissue  architecture regardless of needle gauge or retrieval method.  Samples 
should be collected via resect ion, core -needle biopsy (at least 3, embedded in 
a single paraffin block), or excisional, incisional, punch, or forceps biopsy 
are acceptable.  Fine-needle aspiration (defined as samples that do not 
preserve  tissue architecture and yield cell suspension an d/or smears), 
brushing, cell pellets from pleural effusion, and lavage samples are not 
acceptable.  Tumor tissue from bone metastases that have been decalcified is 
not acceptable.  
 For patients with non squamous NSCLC, if EGFR  and/or ALK status is unknown, 
these must be assessed locally using a validated health  authorityapproved test or 
at a c entral laboratory (see Section 4.1.2  for exclusion criteria).  If samples are 
submitted for central testing, a n additional 5 unstained slides must be provided  (see 
additional details in the laboratory manual).  
 Tumor tissue sample obtained at the time of progression, if deemed clinically 
feasible, for explo ratory rese arch on biomarkers , including biomarker assay 
development  
Biopsies at the time of progression should be performed within 40 days after 
progression or prior to the next anti -cancer therapy, whichever is sooner.  
Samples collected via resection, core -needle biopsy, or excisional, incisional, 
punch, or forceps biopsy are preferred.  
 
Exploratory biomarker research in tumor tissue and blood may include, but will not be 
limited to, analysis of proteins, genes or gene signatures associated with  tumor 
immunobiology , PD-L1, markers associated with T -cell activation, or  density, 
localization, and activation status of immune cells and their subsets,  and may involve 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
72/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  extraction of DNA, ctDNA, or RNA, analysis of  somatic mutations, and use of NGS 
(including but not limite d to WES) . 
On the basis of emerging safety, activity, or efficacy data, the number of PK  and ADA 
samples may be reduced or sample collection may cease altogether.   Additionally, these 
collected samples may not be analyzed if not warranted.   After final OS analysis is 
conducted, the Sponsor may decide to no longer collect additional biomarker samples.  
The existing collected samples may still be used for exploratory analysis.  
For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instruct ions, see the 
laboratory manual.  
Unless the patient gives specific consent for his or her leftover samples to be stored for 
optional exploratory research (see Section  4.5.10 ), biological samples will be destroyed 
no later than the time of completion of the final Clinical Study Report, with the following 
exception s: 
 Serum  and plasma  samples collected for PK or immunogenicity analysis  may be 
needed for addi tional immunogenicity characterization and for PK or immunogenicity 
assay  development and  validation ; therefore, these samples  will be destroyed no 
later than 5 years after the final CSR has been completed , or earlier depending on 
local regulations . 
 Blood and tumor samples collected for biomarker research  and biomarker assay 
development  will be destroyed no later than 5 year s after the final CSR  has been 
completed .  However, the storage period will be in accordance with the 
IRB/EC -approved  Informed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., health 
authority requirements) . 
 For enrolled patients, remaining archival tissue blocks will be returned to the site 
upon request or 18 months after final closure of the study database, whichever 
occurs first.  For patients who are not enrolled, remaining archival tissue blocks will 
be returned to the site no later than 6 weeks after eligibility determination.  
 
When a patient withdraws from the study, samples collected prior to the date of 
withdrawal may still be analyzed, un less the patient specifically requests that the 
samples be destroyed or local laws require destruction of the samples.   However, if 
samples have been tested prior to withdrawal, results from those tests will remain as 
part of the overall research data.  
Data arising from sample analysis , including data on genomic variants , will be subject  to 
the confidentiality standards described in Section  8.4. 
Given the complexity and exploratory nature of exploratory biomarker analyses, data 
derived from these analyses will generally not be provided to study investigators or 
patients unless required by law.  The aggregate results of any conducted research will 
be available in accordance with the effective Sponsor policy on study data publication.  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
73/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  4.5.8  Electrocardiograms  
At screening and during the study, single ECG assessments will be performed wi th 
standard 12 -lead ECG equipment according to standard procedures to determine the 
corrected QT interval calculated using  the Fridericia formula (QTcF).   If at any time a 
single ECG shows a QTcF with an absolute value  480 ms or a n increase in the QTcF 
of  60 ms above baseline, two additional ECGs at intervals of approximately 3 minutes  
must be performed within 30 minutes  after the initial ECG, and the average of these 
three consecutive results for QTcF will be used as the value assessed (see  Appendix  7).  
ECG s will be performed at the time points as indicated in the schedule of activities 
(Appendix  1).  ECGs for each patient should be obtained from the same machine 
wherever possible.  Lead placement should be as consistent as possible.  ECG 
recordings must be performed after the patient has been resting in a supine position for 
at least 10  minutes.  
For safety monitoring purposes, the investigator must review, sign, and date all ECG 
tracings.  Paper copies of ECG tracings will be kept as part of the patient's permanent 
study file at the site.  Any morphologic waveform changes or other ECG abnormalities 
must be documented on the eCRF.  
Abnormalities in the ECG that lead to a change in patient  management (e .g., dose 
reduced or interrupted, treatment discontinued, requirement for additional medication or 
monitoring) or result in clinical signs and symptoms a re considered clinically significant 
for the purposes of this study and will be deemed adverse event s.  If values meet criteria 
defining them as serious, they must be reported as serious adverse event s 
(Section  5.4.2 ). 
The Fridericia formula is depicted below for calculation of the QTcF value.  
 
QT = measured QT interval in milliseconds; RR = measured R to R 
interval (which can be derived from the heart rate as 60/heart rate)    
4.5.9  Patient -Reported Outcome Assessments  
PRO  questionnaires will be completed t o more fully characterize the clinical profile of 
atezolizumab  and cabozantinib  to complement traditional endpoints of survival, tumor 
progression and toler ability .  In addition, PRO questionnaires will enable the capture of 
each patient's direct experience with atezolizumab and cabozantinib.  
PROs of symptom  severity and functioning , including HRQoL , will be collected  through 
use of the  EORTC  library , including the generic  QoL questionnaires for cancer (EORTC 

 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
74/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  QLQ -C30), selected scales from the  EORTC QLQ -C30 (EORTC IL17), its lung-specif ic 
module  (EORTC QLQ -LC13) , one item (IL46) documenting overall treatment  burden , 
and selected items from the PRO -CTCA E library to inform symptoms commonly 
experienced while receiving atezolizumab, cabozantinib , or docetaxel . 
In addition, the EQ -5D-5L will be used  in this study for economic modeling.  
Patients will be requested to complete EQ-5D-5L, the EORTC QLQ -C30, EORTC QLQ -
LC13, EORTC IL46 , and PRO -CTCAE items at baseline ( i.e., Day 1 of Cycle 1 ) and on 
Day 1 of each cycle thereafter  (see Appendix  1), until and including the study treatment 
discontinuation visit .   
During the survival follow -up, once all treatments are discontinued, all patients will 
complete only the EORTC IL17  and EQ -5D-5L questionnaires  at 3 and 6 months .  
Completion of PRO questionnaires will no longer be required after the final OS 
analysis.  
4.5.9.1  Data Collection Methods for Patient -Reported Outcome 
Assessments  
PRO questionnaire  will be self -administered on paper or interviewer -administered (as 
appropriate) at the clinic at specified timepoints during the study (see schedule of 
activities in  Appendix  1).  At the clinic, questionnaire s will be administered before the 
patient receives any information on disease status, prior to the performance of non -PRO 
assessments  that might bias patients’ ratings , and prior to the administration of study 
treatment .  For patients who are unable to come into the clinic due  to government 
restrictions or personal safety, PROs may be completed via telephone  call; source 
documentation should be obtained which includes, among other information,  that the 
questionnaires were a dministered via telephone.  
PRO questionnaires , translated into the local language as appropriate, will be completed 
on paper questionnaires  provided by the Sponsor.  During clinic visits, PRO 
questionnaires  should be administered as outlined below:  
 Patient s' health status should not be discussed prior to administration of the 
questionnaires . 
 Sites must administer the official version of each questionnaire , as provided by the 
Sponsor. Questionnaires must not be copied from the protocol.  
 Sites should allow su fficient time for patients to complete the questionnaires . 
 Sites should administer the questionnaires in a quiet area with minimal distractions 
and disruptions.  
 Patients should be instructed to answer questions to the best of their ability; there 
are no right or wrong answers.  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
75/Protocol GO41892, Version 5   Site staff should not interpret or explain questions but may read questions verbatim 
upon request.  
 Patients should not obtain advice or help from others (e.g., family members or 
friends) when completing the questionnaires . 
 Site staf f should review all completed questionnaires and should ask the patient to 
rectify any response that is not clearly marked in the appropriate location.  If a 
response is missing, site staff should ask the patient to complete the item or confirm 
that the it em was intentionally left blank.  
 If any of the questionnaires are not completed for any reason, the site staff should 
report the reason for non -completion in the eCRF.  
 
4.5.9.2  Description of Patient -Reported Outcome Assessment 
Questionnaires   
EORTC QLQ -C30 
The EO RTC QLQ -C30 is a validated, reliable self -report measure (Aaronson et al. 1993; 
Fitzsimmons  et al. 1999) (see  Appendix  9).  It consists of 30 questions that assess five 
aspects of patient functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive, and  social), 
three  symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), GHS  and QoL, and six 
single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial 
difficulties) with a recall period of the previous week.  Scale scores can be obtained for 
the multi -item scales.  The functioning and symptoms items are scored on a 4 -point 
scale that ranges from "not at all" to  "very much," and the GHS  and QoL items are 
scored on a 7 -point scale that ranges from "very poor" to "excellent."  The  EORTC 
QLQ -C30 module takes approximately 10  minutes to complete.  Selected scales 
(EORTC IL17) will be collected during survival follow up (see  Appendix  13). 
EORTC QLQ -LC13  
The EORTC QLQ -LC13 is a modular supplement to the EORTC QoL questionnaire for 
use in lung cancer  (see Appendix  10).  This module  incorporates one multiple -item scale 
to assess dyspnea and a series of single item  scale s assessing pain, coughing, 
sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, and hemoptysis.  All items are 
using a 4 -point scale previously described.  The QLQ -LC13  module takes approximately 
5 minutes to complete . 
Selected I tems from EORTC Item Library   
In addition, one -item EORTC IL46 will be collected  to assess overall side effect impact.   
The item “ To what extent have you been troubled with side -effects from your treatment?” 
uses the same rating scale of 4 points previously described  (see Appendix  10).  
EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ-5D-5L is a validated  self-report health status questionnaire that is used to 
calculate a health status utility score for use in health economic analyses (EuroQol 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
76/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  Group  1990; Brooks 1996; Herdman e t al. 2011; Janssen et al. 2013; see Appendix  11).  
There are two components to the EQ-5D-5L:  a five -item heal th state profile that 
assesses mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, as 
well as a VAS that measures health state.  The EQ -5D-5L is designed to capture the 
patient's current health status.  Published weighting systems allow for creation of a 
single composite  score  of the patient's health status .  The EQ-5D-5L takes 
approximately 3 minutes to complete.  It  will be used  in this study  for inform ing 
pharmacoeconomic evaluations . 
PRO -CTCAE  
The PRO -CTCAE is a validated item bank that is used to characterize the presence, 
frequency of occurrence, severity, and/or degree of interference with daily function of 
78 patient -reportable symptomatic treatment toxicities (Basch et al. 2014; Dueck et al. 
2015) .  The PRO -CTCAE contains 124 questions that are rated either dichotomously (for 
determination of presence vs. absence) or on a 5 -point Likert scale (for determination of 
frequency of occurrence, severity, and interference with daily function).  Treatment 
toxicities can occur with observable signs (e.g., vomiting) or non -observable symptoms 
(e.g., nausea).  The standard PRO -CTCAE recall period is the previous 7 days.   Items 
from the PRO -CTCAE were selected based on their relevance to capture symptoms 
common ly reported with atezolizumab, cabozantinib, or docetaxel intake and not 
captured by the EORTC QLQ -C30 and QLQ -LC13.  These items capture rash, itching, 
chills  (for IR) , musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, dysgeusia and neuropathic pain  
(see Appendix  12). 
4.5.10  Optional Tumor Biopsies and Blood Samples  
Consenting patients may undergo additional on -treatment biopsies at any other time at 
the investigator’s discre tion (if deemed clinically feasible by the investigator) .  Biopsies 
collected at the investigator’s discretion are preferred at the time of clinical events 
(e.g.,  clinical response).   Samples collected via resection, core -needle biopsy  (at least 
three cores preferred, embedded in a single paraffin block) , or excisional, incisional, 
punch, or forceps biopsy are preferred .  The Informed Consent Form will contain a 
separate section that addresses optional biopsies.  A separate, specific si gnature will be 
required to document a patient's agreement to undergo optional biopsies.  The 
investigator should document whether or not the patient has given consent to participate 
and (if applicable) the date(s) of consent, by completing the Optional Tissue Biopsy 
Sample Informed Consent eCRF.  
Samples may be used for exploratory biomarker research as described in Section  4.5.7 .  
For sampling procedure s, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the 
laboratory manual.  Refer to Section  4.5.7  for details on duration of sample storage, use 
of samples after patient withdrawal, confidentiality standards for data, and availability of 
data from biomarker analyses.  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
77/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  4.5.10.1  Overview of the Research Biosample Repository  
The Research Biosample Repository (RBR) is a centrally administered group of facilities 
used for the long -term storage of human biological specimens, including body fluids, 
solid tissues, and derivatives thereof (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides).  The 
collection, storage, and analysis of RBR samples will facilitate the rational design of n ew 
pharmaceutical agents and the development of diagnostic tests, which may allow for 
individualized drug therapy for patients in the future.  
Samples for the RBR will be collected from patients who give specific consent to 
participate in this optional rese arch.  RBR samples will be analyzed to achieve one or 
more of the following objectives:  
 To study the association of biomarkers with efficacy or disease progression  
 To identify safety biomarkers that are associated with susceptibility to developing 
adverse events or can lead to improved adverse event monitoring or investigation  
 To increase knowledge and understanding of disease biology and drug safety  
 To study drug response, including drug effects and the processes of drug absorption 
and disposition  
 To devel op biomarker or diagnostic assays and establish the performance 
characteristics of these assays  
 
For more information on collection of RBR samples see Appendix  2.  
4.5.10.2  Approval by the Institutional Review Board or Ethics 
Committee  
Collection, storage, and analysis of RBR samples is contingent upon the review and 
approval of the exploratory research and the RBR portion of the Informed Consent For m 
by each site's Institutional IRB/EC  and, if applicable, an appropriate regulatory body.  If a 
site has not been granted approval for RBR sampling, this section of the protocol will not 
be applicable at that site.  
4.5.10.3  Sample Collection  
The following samples will be stored in the RBR and used for research purposes, 
including, but not limited to, research on biomarkers related to atezolizumab, 
cabozantinib, docetaxe l, diseases, or drug safety:   
 Blood samples colle cted predose on Day 1 of C ycle 1 .   
Although strongly preferred, if sample collection is not feasible predose on Day 
1 of Cycle 1, then blood samples may be collected  predose on Day 1 of any 
subsequent cycle visit.  
 Leftover blood, serum, plasma, PBMC, and tumor  tissue samples  (with the 
exception of remaining  archival tissue  blocks, which will be returned to sites ) and 
any derivatives thereof  (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides) , including leftover 
tissue samples from medically indicated procedures (e.g., bronchoscopy, 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
78/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  esophagogastr oduodenoscopy, colonoscopy) performed at the investigator's 
discretion during the course of the study  
 
The above samples may be sent to one or more laboratories for analysis of germline or 
somatic variants via whole genome sequencing (WGS), WES , or other genomic analysis 
methods.  Genomics is increasingly informing researcher's understanding of disease 
pathobiology.  WGS and WES provide a comprehensive characterization of the genome 
and exome, respectively, and, along with clinical data collected in this s tudy, may 
increase the opportunity for developing new therapeutic approaches or new methods for 
monitoring efficacy and safety or predicting which patients are more likely to respond to 
a drug or develop adverse events.  
Data generated from RBR samples will  be analyzed in the context of this study but may 
also be explored in aggregate with data from other studies.  The availability of a larger 
dataset will assist in identification and characterization of important biomarkers and 
pathways to support future dr ug development.  
For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the 
laboratory manual.   
RBR samples are to be stored until they are no longer needed or until they are 
exhausted.  However, the RBR storage period will be in accor dance with the 
IRB/EC -approved Informed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., health authority 
requirements).  
4.5.10.4  Confidentiality  
RBR samples and associated data will be labeled with a unique patient identification 
number.  
Patient medical information associa ted with RBR samples is confidential and may be 
disclosed to third parties only as permitted by the Informed Consent Form (or  separate 
authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by the 
patient, unless permitted or required by law.  
Given the complexity and exploratory nature of the analyses  of RBR samples , data 
derived from these analyses  will generally not be provided to study investigators or 
patients unless required by law.  The aggregate results of any conducted research will 
be available in accordance with the effective Sponsor policy on study data publication.  
Data generated from RBR samples must be available for inspection upon request by 
representatives of national and local health authorities, and Sponsor monitors, 
representatives, and collaborators, as appropriate.  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
79/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know -how originating from 
the use of the RBR data will become and remain the exclusive and unburdened property 
of the Sponsor, except where agreed otherwise.  
4.5.10.5  Consent to Participate in the Research Biosample Repository  
The Informed Consent Form will contain a separate section that addresses participation 
in the RBR.  The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each patient the 
objectives, methods, and potential hazards of participation in the RBR.  Patients will be 
told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their consent  at any time 
and for any reason during the storage period.  A separate, specific signature will be 
required to document a patient's agreement to provide optional RBR samples .  Patients 
who decline to participate will not provide a separate signature.  
The investigator should document whether or not the patient has given consent to 
participate and (if app licable) the date(s) of consent, by completing the RBR Research 
Sample Informed Consent eCRF.  
In the event of an RBR participant's death or loss of competence, the participant's 
samples and data will continue to be used as part of the RBR research.  
4.5.10.6  Withdra wal from the Research Biosample Repository  
Patients who give consent to provide RBR samples have the right to withdraw their 
consent at any time for any reason.  After withdrawal of consent, any remaining samples 
will be destroyed or will no longer be link ed to the patient.  However, if RBR samples 
have been tested prior to withdrawal of consent, results from those tests will remain as 
part of the overall research data.  If a patient wishes to withdraw consent to the testing of 
his or her RBR samples during  the study, the investigator must inform the Medical 
Monitor in writing of the patient's wishes through use of the appropriate RBR Subject  
Withdrawal Form and must enter the date of withdrawal on the RBR Research Sample 
Withdrawal of Informed Consent eCRF.   If a patient wishes to withdraw consent to the 
testing of his or her RBR samples after closure of the site, the investigator must inform 
the Sponsor by emailing the study number and patient number to the following email 
address:  
global .rcr-withdrawal@roche.com  
A patient's withdrawal from this study does not, by itself, constitute withdrawal of consent 
for testing of RBR samples.  Likewise, a patient's withdrawal of consent for testing of 
RBR samples does not constitute withdrawal from this study.  
4.5.10.7  Monitoring and Oversight  
RBR samples will be tracked in a manner consistent with Good Clinical Practice by a 
quality -controlled, auditable, and appropriately validated laboratory information 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
80/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  management system, to ensure compliance with data con fidentiality as well as 
adherence to authorized use of samples as specified in this protocol and in the Informed 
Consent Form.  Sponsor monitors and auditors will have direct access to appropriate 
parts of records relating to patient participation in the R BR for the purposes of verifying 
the data provided to the Sponsor.  The site will permit monitoring, audits, IRB/EC review, 
and health authority inspections by providing direct access to source data and 
documents related to the RBR samples.  
4.6 TREATMENT, PATI ENT, STUDY, AND SITE DISC ONTINUATION  
4.6.1  Study Treatment Discontinuation  
Patients in th e experimental arm (Atezo   Cabo ) are allowed to discontinue one 
component of the study treatment but continue to receive the other component  as long 
as the patient is exper iencing clinical benefit as determined by the investigator .  Patients 
must permanently discontinue study treatment if they experience any of the  following : 
 Intolerable toxicity related to study treatment, including development of an 
immune -mediated adverse event determined by the investigator to be unacceptable 
given the individual patient's potential response to therapy and  severity of the event.  
 Any medical condition that may jeopardize the patient's safety if he or she continues 
study tr eatment  
 Investigator or Sponsor determination that treatment discontinuation is in the best 
interest of the patient  
 Use of another  non-protocol  anti-cancer therapy  
 Pregnancy  
 Patients receiving atezolizumab  and cabozantinib :  Loss of clinical benefit as 
determined by the investigator  after an integrated assessment of radiographic and 
biochemical data, local biopsy results (if availab le), and clinical status 
(e.g.,  symptomatic deterioration such as pain se condary to disease; see 
Section  4.5.5  for details ).   
 Patients receiving docetaxel:   Radiographic  disease progression per RECIST  v1.1 
or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression  
For equivocal findings of progression (e.g., very small or uncertain new lesions or 
lymph nodes), treatment may be continued until the next scheduled assessment.  
 
The primary reason for study treatment discontinuation should be documented on the  
appropriate eC RF.  Patients who discontinue study treatment prematurely will not be 
replaced.  
4.6.1.1  Post -Treatment Assessments  
Patients will return to the clinic for a treatment discontinuation visit  30 days  after the 
final dose of study treatment  (see Appendix  1).  The visit at which response assessment 
shows PD may be used as the t reatment discontinuation visit.   Patients who discontinue 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
81/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  study treatment  (for any reason ) in the absence of radi ographic progression (per  
RECIST v.1.1 ) will continue to under go tumor response assessments as outlined in the 
schedule of activities (see  Appendix  1).   
After treatment discontinuation, information on survival follow -up and new anti -cancer 
therapy will be collected by means of telephone calls, patient medical records, and/or 
clinic visits approximately every 3 months or more frequently until death (unless the 
patient withdraws consent for follow -up or the Sponsor terminates the study) (see 
Appendix  1).  After completion of final OS analysis, patients will only need to be 
followed for 6 months  after the last dose of study treatment  and information on new 
anti-cancer therapy will no longer be required .  Completion of PRO questionnaires will 
also no longer be required after the final OS analysis . 
If a patient  is discontinued from study treatment because of an adverse event  (including 
adverse events of special interest ; see Section  5.2.3 ) considered to be related to study 
treatment and the event is ongoing 30  days after the final dose of study treatment, the 
event must be followed until resolution or determination by the investigator that the event 
has become stable or irreversible.  
4.6.2  Patient Discontinuation  from the Study  
Patients have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  
In addition, the investigator has the right to withdraw a patient from the study at any time.  
Reasons for patient discontinuation from the study may include, but are not limited to, 
the following:  
 Patient withdrawal of consent  
 Study termination or site closure  
 Loss to follow -up 
 Patient non -compliance, defined as failure to comply with protocol requirements as 
determined by the investigator or Sponsor  
 
Every effort should be made to obtain a reason for patient discontinuation from the 
study.  The primary reason for discontinuation from the study should be documented on 
the appropriate eCRF.  If a patient requests to be withdrawn from the study  (i.e., survival 
follow -up), this request must be documented in the source documents and signed by the 
investigator.  Patients who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  
If a pa tient withdraws from the study, the study staff may use a public information source 
(e.g.,  county records) to obtain in formation about survival status . 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
82/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  4.6.3  Study Discontinuation  
The Sponsor has the right to terminate this study at any time.  Reasons for terminating 
the study may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 The incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies indicates a 
potential health hazard to patients  
 Patie nt enrollment is unsatisfactory  
 
The Sponsor will notify the  investigator if the Sponsor decides to discontinue the study.   
4.6.4  Site Discontinuation  
The Sponsor has the right to close a site at any time.  Reasons for closing a site may 
include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 Excessively slow recruitment  
 Poor p rotocol adherence  
 Inaccurate or incomplete data recording  
 Non-compliance with the International Council for Harmonisation  (ICH) guideline for 
Good Clinical Practice  
 No study activity (i.e., all patients have completed the study and all obligations have 
been fulfilled)  
 
5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY   
5.1 SAFETY PLAN  
The safety plan for patients in this study is based on clinical experience with 
atezolizumab and cabozantinib  in completed and /or ongoing studies  and the most 
current prescribing information for docetaxel .  The anticipated important safety risks are 
outlined below (see Section s 5.1.1 , 5.1.2 , and 5.1.3 ). 
Measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study, 
including the use of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Section  4.1) and close 
monitoring of patients during the study  as indicated below .  Administration of 
atezolizumab , docetaxel, and the first dose of cabozantinib  will be performed in a 
monitored setting in which there is immediate access to trained personnel and adequate 
equipment and medicine to manage potentially serious reactions.  Subsequent doses of 
cabozantinib will be self -administered at home (Section  4.3.2.1 ).  Guidelines for 
managing patients who experience anticipated adverse events, including criteria for 
dosage modification and treatment interruption  or discontinuation, are provided in 
Appendix  6 for atezolizumab, Appendix  7 for cabozantinib, and local prescribing 
information  for docetaxel .  Refer to Sections  5.4  5.7 for details on safety reporting 
(e.g.,  adverse events, pregnancies) for this study.  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
83/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  Patients with active infection are excluded from study participation.  In the setting of a 
pandemic or epidemic, screening for active infections (including SARS -CoV-2) prior to 
and during study participation should be considered according to local or insti tutional 
guidelines or guidelines of applicable professional societies (e.g., American Society of 
Clinical Oncology  or ESMO ). 
Severe SARS -CoV-2 infection  appears to be associated with a CRS involving the 
inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-10, IL -2, and IFN - (Merad and Martin 2020 ).  If a patient 
develops suspected CRS during the study, a differential diagnosis should include  
SARS -CoV-2 infection , which should be confirmed or refuted through assessment of 
exposure history, appropriate laboratory testing, and c linical or radiologic evaluations per 
investigator judgment.  If a diagnosis of SARS -CoV-2 infection  is confirmed, the disease 
should be managed as per local or institutional guidelines.

Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
84/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  For more details regarding the safety profile and management guidelines for adverse 
events associated with docetaxel , refer to the local docetaxel prescribing information .  
The investigator may use discretion in adhering to the guidelines , as well as local 
hospital or clinical practice , considering  the severity of the event and benefit versus risk 
for the patient, with the goal of max imizing patient compliance and access to supportive 
care.    
5.1.4  Management of Patients Who Experience Adverse Events  and 
Potential Overlapping Toxicities  
Atezolizumab and cabozantinib have molecule -specific safety profiles based on their 
mechanism of action an d adverse events that may overlap.  These overlapping adverse 
events include, but are not limited to, hepatotoxic, endocrine, gastrointestinal, 
dermatologic, neurologic, renal, and pulmonary events, as well as sign and symptoms 
such as fatigue and decrease d appetite that may be related to multiple system organ 
class events.  The attribution of each drug in certain adverse events may be uncertain 
when the products are administrated as a combination treatment and warrant diagnostic 
investigation.   
For the ma nagement of such potentially overlapping adverse events in patients treated 
with atezolizumab in combination with cabozantinib, adverse events should be managed 
according to the recommendation in Appendix  6 (atezolizumab) and Appendix  7 
(cabozantinib), applied to the component of the st udy treatment judged to be the primary 
cause.  If individual component causality for adverse events cannot be adequately 
determined, conservative management recommendation should be followed to include 
dose modification/interruption of both agents.  
5.1.4.1  Dose Mo difications  
Atezolizumab  
There will be no dose modifications, including dose reductions for atezolizumab in this 
study.  
Cabozantinib  
Dose modifications for cabozantinib are as follows:  
 Two dose reduction levels of cabozantinib (20 mg daily, and 20 mg every other day 
[QOD]) are permitted on the experimental combination arm (see  Table  3). 
 Dose modification criteria for treatment -related adverse events of  cabozantinib are 
shown in  Table  4.  
 Dose re -institution and re -escalation after dose interruptions and/or reductions:  
If the patient recovers from his or  her toxicities to   Grade 1 per NCI CTCAE 
v.5.0 or to the baseline value (or lower) and the adverse event was unrelated to 
cabozantinib, then cabozantinib may be restarted with no change in dose.  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
85/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  If the patient recovers from his or her toxicities to   Grade 1 or to the baseline 
value (or lower) and the adverse event was deemed possibly related to 
cabozantinib, then cabozantinib may be restarted at a reduced dose (see  
Table  4).  Patients who initiated treatment with cabozantinib at 40 mg and 
experience a possibly related adverse event of Grade 1 or 2 severity may be 
restarted with no dose change after recovery of the toxicities to   Grade 1 or to 
the baseline value (or lower) if appropriate supportive care can prevent or 
minimize the risk of the adverse event.  
Patients receiving a dose of 20 mg QOD on the experimental combination arm who 
have cabozantinib interrupted may be restarted  at the same dose if deemed safe at 
the discretion of the Investigator.  Patients unable to tolerate a dose of 20  mg QOD 
must discontinue cabozantinib.  
Re-escalation to the previous dose may be al lowed at the discretion of the 
investigator but no sooner th an 2 weeks beyond resolution of adverse events that 
led to the dose reduction, which have resolved or recovered to Grade 1 (or baseline 
value) and deemed tolerable and easily managed by optimized supportive 
treatment.  Dose re -escalation is not allowed fol lowing a cabozantinib -related dose 
reduction for Grade 4 hematologic toxicities or Grade 4 adverse events affecting 
major organs (e.g., CNS, cardiac, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, GI).  
 For patients concurrently taking a strong CYP3A4  inhibitor, reduce the dai ly 
cabozantinib dose by 20 mg ( e.g., from 40 mg to 20 mg daily).   Resume the dose 
that was used prior to initiating the CYP3A4 inhibitor 2 to 3 days after discontinuation 
of the strong inhibitor.  
 For patients concurrently taking a strong CYP3A4 i nducer, in crease the daily 
cabozantinib dose by 20 mg ( e.g., from 40 mg to 60 mg daily or from 20 mg to 40 mg 
daily) as tolerated.  Resume the dose that was used prior to initiating the CYP3A4 
inducer 2 to 3 days after discontinuation of the strong inducer.  The dai ly dose of 
cabozantinib should not exceed 60 mg.

Grade 2 AEs which are intolerable  
and cannot be adequately 
managed   Continue cabozantinib at the current dose level with 
supportive care.  
 
Cabozantinib should be dose reduced or interrupted.  
Note:   It is recommen ded that dose interruptions be as 
brief as possible.  
Grade 3 AEs (except clinically 
non-relevant laboratory 
abnormalities)  Cabozantinib should be interrupted unless the toxicity 
can be easily managed with a dose reduction of 
cabozantinib and optimal medical care.  
Note:   It is recommended that dose interruptions be as 
brief as possible.  
Grade 4 AEs (except clinically 
non-relevant laboratory 
abnormalities)  Cabozantinib must be interrupted immediately.  
In general, cabozantinib should be discontinued unless 
the following criteria are met:  
 Patient is deriving clear clinical benefit as 
determined by the investigator and agreed by  the 
Sponsor.  
 Toxicity can be managed with a dose reduction of 
cabozantinib following recovery to Grade  1 (or 
baseline) and optimal medical care.  
 
Sponsor must be contacted to discuss treatment 
continuation upon resolution of AEs.   
AE  adverse event.    
For guidelines  on dose modifications to manage specific adverse events associated  
cabozantinib treatment, see  Appendix  7. 
Docetaxel  
A single dose  reduction  of docetaxel is permitted for management of drug -related 
toxicities  (refer to the local docetaxel prescribing information for the recommended dose 
reduction ).  After dose reduction, the dose will not be escalated during subsequent 
administrations.   If further dose reduction is indicated, the patient must discontinue 
docetaxel.  
5.1.4.2  Treatment Interruption  
Dose interruptions of study treatment  may occur at any time and independ ently at the 
discretion of the i nvestigator  for management of adverse events .  If eithe r or both study 
treatments in the experimental arm  are interru pted more than 12 weeks, the Sponsor 
should be contacted to discuss potential treatment continuati on. 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
87/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  Patients on the experimental arm ( Atezo   Cabo ) will be allowed to discontinue one 
component  of the study treatment but continue to receive the other; the investigator is 
encouraged to discuss such circumstances with the Sponsor.  
Atezolizumab treatment may be temporarily suspended in patients experiencing toxicity 
considered to be related to study treatment.  If corticosteroids are initiated for treatment 
of the toxicity, they must be tapered over 1 month to the equivalent of  10 mg/day oral 
prednisone before atezolizumab can be resumed.  If atezolizumab is withheld for 
 12 weeks after event onset, the patient will be discontinued from atezolizumab.  
However, atezolizumab may be withheld for  12 weeks to allow for patients to ta per off 
corticosteroids prior to resuming treatment.  Atezolizumab can be resumed after being 
withheld for  12 weeks if the patient is likely to derive clinical benefi t.  The decision to 
re-challenge patients with atezolizumab should be based on the inves tigator’s 
benefitrisk assessment and documented by the investigator.  The Medical Monitor is 
available to advise as needed .  Atezolizumab treatment may be suspended for reasons 
other than toxicity (e.g., surgical procedures).  The acceptable length of tre atment 
interruption must be based on the investigator’s  benefitrisk assessment and in 
alignment with the protocol requirements for the duration of treatment and documented 
by the investigator.   The Medical Monitor is available to advise as needed . 
For guidelines on treatment interruption to manage specific adverse events associated  
with atezolizumab  and cabozantinib , see Appendix  6 for atezolizumab  and Appendix  7 
for cabozantinib .   
Docetaxel treatment may be temporarily suspended in patients who experience toxicity 
considered to be related to study treatment .  For guidelines on treatment interruption to 
manage specific adverse events associated  with docetaxel, please refer to the local 
docetaxel prescribing information.  
Dose interruptions for reasons other than toxicity (e.g., surgical procedures ) may be 
allowed  after consultation with the Medical Monitor .  The investigator  will determine the 
acceptable length of treatment interruption.   
5.2 SAFETY PARAMETERS AN D DEFINITIONS  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording adverse events, in cluding 
serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest , performing 
protocol -specified safety laboratory assessments , measuring protocol -specified vital 
signs , and conducting  other protocol -specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety 
evaluation of the study.  
Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in 
Section  5.4. 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
88/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  5.2.1  Adverse Events  
Accordin g to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any 
untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient  administered a 
pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can 
therefore be any of th e following:  
 Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product  
 Any new disease or exacer bation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition) (see Sections  5.3.5.9  and 
5.3.5.10  for more information)  
 Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline  
 Any deterioration in a laborato ry value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study treatment  
 Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g.,  screening invasive 
procedures such as biopsies)  
 
5.2.2  Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to the 
Sponsor ) 
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets a ny of the following criteria:  
 Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death)  
 Is life threatening (i.e.,  the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death)  
This does not include any adver se event that , had it occurred in a more severe form 
or was allowed to continue , might have caused death.  
 Requires or prolongs inpatient hosp italization (see Section  5.3.5.11 ) 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient's ability to conduct normal life 
functions)  
 Is a congenit al anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study treatment  
 Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outco mes 
listed above)  
 
The terms "severe " and "serious " are not synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event ( e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE; 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
89/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  see Section  5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such 
as severe headache without any further findings).  
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF.  
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section  5.4.2  for 
reporting instructions).  
5.2.3  Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable to 
the Sponsor ) 
Adverse events of special interest  are required to be reported by the investigator to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Section  5.4.2  for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of special interest for this study 
are as follows : 
 Cases of pote ntial drug -induced liver injury  that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical ja undice, as defined by Hy's 
Law (see Section 5.3.5.7 ) 
 Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study treatment , as defined 
below  
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical s ymptoms or laboratory findings that indicate  an 
infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only 
when a contamination of study treatment  is suspected.  
 Systemic lupus erythematosus  
 Events suggestive of hypersensitivity, IRRs , CRS, macrophage activating 
syndrome, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis  
 Nephritis  
 Ocular toxicities (e.g., uveitis, retinitis , optic neuritis ) 
 Grade  2 cardiac disorders  
 Vasculitis  
 Autoimmune hemolytic anemia  
 Severe cutaneous reactions (e.g., Stevens -Johnson syndrome, dermatitis bullous, 
toxic epidermal necrolysis)  
 Grade  3 diarrhea  
 Myelitis  
 Facial paresis

5.3 METHODS AND TIMING F OR CAPTURING AND ASS ESSING 
SAFETY  PARAMETERS  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see  Section  5.2.1  for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to  the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions prov ided in this section and in Sections 5.4 - 5.6. 
For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2  for seriousness criteria), severity (see 
Section 5.3.3 ), and causali ty (see Section  5.3.4 ).   
5.3.1  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contac t.  All 
adverse events, whether reported by the patient or noted by study personnel,  will be 
recorded in the patient's medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study treatment , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported 
(see Section 5.4.2  for instructions for reporting serious adverse events).  
After initiation of study treatment , all adverse events will be reported until 30 days  after 
the final dose of study treatment  or until initiation o f new systemic anti-cancer therapy, 
whichever occurs  first, and serious adverse events and adverse events of special 
interest will continue to be reported until 90 days after the final dose of study treatment  
or until initiation of new systemic anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs  first. 
Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse event reporting 
period are provided in Section 5.6. 
5.3.2  Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient evaluation timepoints.  Examples of non-directive  
questions include the following:  
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit?"  
"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?"  
 
5.3.3  Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events  
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v 5.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table  5 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specifically l isted in the NCI CTCAE.

a Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or 
clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
b Examples of self -care activities of daily living include bathing, dressing and undressing, 
feeding oneself, using the toilet, and taking m edications, as performed by patients who are 
not bedridden.  
c If an event is assessed as a "significant medical event," it must be reported as a serious 
adverse event (see Section 5.4.2  for reporting instructions), per the definition of serious 
adverse event in Section  5.2.2 . 
d Grade 4 and 5 events must be reported as serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2  for 
reporting instructions), per the definition of serious adverse event in Section  5.2.2 . 
  
5.3.4  Assessment of Causality of Adverse Even ts 
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an 
adverse event is considered to be related to study treatment , indicating "yes" or "no" 
accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration  (see also  
Table  6): 
 Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study treatment  
 Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects  of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study treatment , or reintroduction of study treatment  (as 
applicable)  
 Known association of the event with study treatment  or with similar treatments  
 Known association of the event with the disease under study  
 Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event  
 Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event  
 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
92/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  Table  6 Causal Attribution Guidance  
Is the adverse event suspected to be caused by study treatment  on the basis of facts, 
evidence, science -based rationales, and clinical judgment?  
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of study treatment , and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by 
the patient's  clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to study treatment ; and/or the 
adverse event abat es or resolves upon discontinuation of study treatment  or dose 
reduction and, if  applicable, reappears upon re -challenge . 
NO An adverse event will be considered related, unless it fulfills the criteria specified below .   
Evidence exists that the adverse e vent has an etiology other than study treatment  
(e.g.,  preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, 
or concomitant medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of study treatment  (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after 
first dose of study treatment ). 
  
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy.  
5.3.5  Procedures for Recording Adverse  Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.  
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  
5.3.5.1  Infusion -Related Reactions  
Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after treatment  administration and 
are judged to be related to study treatment  infusion (atezolizumab or docetaxel) should 
be captured as a diagnosis (e.g., "infusion -related reaction") on the A dverse Event 
eCRF.  If possible, avoid ambiguous terms such as "systemic reaction."  Associated 
signs and symptoms should be recorded on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction 
eCRF.  If a patient experiences both a local and systemic reaction to the same dose of 
study treatment , each reaction should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event 
eCRF, with signs and symptoms also recorded separately on the dedicated Infusion -
Related Reaction eCRF.  
5.3.5.2  Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
A diagnosis (if known) sho uld be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than 
jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs 
and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events 
based on signs and s ymptoms should be nullified and replaced by one adverse event 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
93/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting 
date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.  
5.3.5.3  Adverse Events That Are  Secondary to Other Events  
In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of 
severe or serious secondary events.  A medically significant secondary adverse eve nt 
that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent 
event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:  
 If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be repo rted on the eCRF.  
 If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.  
 If a severe GI hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.  
 If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.  
 If neutropenia is accompanied by a n infection, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.  
 
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eC RF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated.  
5.3.5.4  Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between 
patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded  once on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be 
recorded at the time the event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event becomes 
more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see 
Section  5.4.2  for reporting instructions).  The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated 
by changing the event from "non -serious" to "serious," providing the date that the event 
became serious, and completing a ll data fields related to serious adverse events.  
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a 
separate event on the Adverse Event  eCRF.  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
94/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  5.3.5.5  Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
must  be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:  
 Is accompanied by clinical symptoms  
 Results in a cha nge in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)  
 Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy  
 Is clinically significant in the  investigator's judgment  
Note:  For oncology trials, certain abnormal values may not qualify as adverse 
events.  
 
It is the investigator's responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.  
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g.,  ALP and bilirubin 5   ULN associated with chole stasis ), only the diagnosis 
(i.e., chole stasis ) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a 
descriptor indicatin g whether  the test result is above or below the normal range 
(e.g.,  "elevated potassium, " as opposed to "abnormal potassium ").  If the laboratory 
abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the 
clinical term should  be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an  elevated serum 
potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia. " 
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on  the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4  for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).  
5.3.5.6  Abnormal Vital Sign Values  
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must  
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:  
 Is accompanied by clinical symptoms  
 Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage mo dification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)  
 Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy  
 Is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment  
 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
95/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  It is the investigator's responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an adverse event.  
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a  disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e.,  hypertension) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4  for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).  
5.3.5.7  Abnormal Liver Function Tests  
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3  ULN) in combination with either an elevated 
total bilirubin (  2  ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other 
causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as 
defined by Hy's Law).   Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the 
occurrence of either of the following:  
 Treatment -emergent ALT or AST  3  ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
 2  ULN 
 Treatment -emergent ALT or AST  3  ULN in combination with clinical  jaundice  
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see  Section 5.3.5. 2) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24  hours after learning of 
the event), either as a serious adverse event or an adverse event of special interest (see 
Section  5.4.2 ). 
5.3.5.8  Deaths  
For this protocol, mortality is an efficacy endpoint.  Deaths  that occur during the 
protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see Sect ion 5.3.1 ) that are attributed 
by the investigator solely to progression of lung cancer  should be recorded on the Death 
Attributed to Progressive Disease eCRF.  All other deaths  that occur during the adverse 
event reporting period , regardless of relationship to study treatment , must be recorded 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see 
Section 5.4.2 ).  The iDMC will monitor the frequency of deaths from all causes.  
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event  or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be 
reported.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the  time of 
reporting, "unexplained death " should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death " should 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
96/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  be replaced by the established cause of death.   The term "sudden death"  should not be 
used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac death").  
Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as 
described in Section 5.6. 
5.3.5.9  Preexisting Medical Conditions  
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History  and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.  
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the 
frequency, severity, or character of  the condition worsens during the study.  When 
recording such events on the  Adverse Event eCRF, it is impo rtant to convey the concept 
that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors 
(e.g.,  "more frequent headaches "). 
5.3.5.10  Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of NonSmall Cell Lung Cancer  
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected p attern of progression of the 
underlying disease should not be recorded as adverse events.  These data will be 
captured as efficacy assessment data only.  In most cases, the expected pattern of 
progression will be based on RECIST  v1.1.  In rare cases, the determination of clinical 
progression will be based on symptomatic deterioration.  However, every effort should 
be made to document progression through use of  objective criteria.  If there is any 
uncertainty as to whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be reported 
as an adverse event.  
5.3.5.11  Hospitalization or Prolonged Hospitalization  
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization  (i.e., inpatient  admission to a hospital)  
or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse 
event (per the definition of serious adverse event in  Section  5.2.2 ), except as outlined 
below.   
An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances should not be 
reported as an adverse event or a serious adverse event:  
 Hospitalization for respite care  
 Planned hospitalization required by the protoc ol (e.g., for study treatment  
administration or performance of an efficacy measurement for the study)  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
97/Protocol GO41892, Version 5   Hospitalization for a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met:  
The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during the 
study when elective surgery became necessary because of the expected 
normal progression of the disease . 
The patient has not experienced  an adverse event . 
 Hospitalization due solely to progr ession of the underlying cancer  
 
An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances is not 
considered to be a serious adverse event, but should be reported as an adverse event 
instead:  
 Hospitalization that was necessary because of patient requirement for outpatient 
care outsi de of normal outpatient clinic operating hours  
 
5.3.5.12  Cases of Overdose , Medication Error , Drug Abuse, or Drug 
Misuse  
Overdose (accidental or intentional), medication error, drug abuse, and drug misuse 
(hereafter collectively referred to as "special situations") , are defined as follows:  
 Accidental overdose:  accidental administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher 
than the assigned dose  
 Intentional overdose:  intentional administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher 
than the assigned dose  
 Medicati on error:  accidental deviation in the administration of a drug  
In some cases, a medication error may be intercepted prior to administration of 
the drug.  
 Drug abuse:  intentional excessive use of a drug that may lead to addiction or 
dependence, physical h arm, and/or psychological harm  
 Drug misuse:  intentional deviation in the administration of a drug that does not 
qualify as drug abuse  
In cases where drug is to be self -administered by the patient, drug misuse 
could involve the drug being administered to someone other than the patient.  
 
Note: Special situations are not in themselves adverse events but may result in adverse 
events.   
Each adverse event associated with a special situation should be recorded separately 
on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills seriousness criteria  
or qualifies as an adverse event of special interest , the event should be reported to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e.,  no more than 24  hours after learning of the event; see  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
98/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  Section  5.4.2 ).  For atezolizumab and cabozantinib , adverse events associated with 
special situations should be recorded as described below for each situation:  
 Accidental overdose:   Enter the adverse event term.  Check the "Accidental 
overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.  
 Intentional overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the "Intentional 
overdose" box.  If drug abuse is suspected, check the "Drug abuse" box.  If drug 
abuse is not suspecte d, check the "Drug misuse" box.  
 Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event 
term.  Check the "Medication error" box.  
 Medication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  
Check  the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.  
 Drug abuse that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  
Check the "Drug abuse" box.  
 Drug abuse that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the 
"Inten tional overdose" and "Drug abuse" boxes.  
 Drug misuse that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  
Check the "Drug misuse" box.  
 Drug misuse that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check 
the "Intentional overdo se" and "Drug misuse" boxes.  
 
As an example, an accidental overdose that resulted in a headache would require two 
entries on the Adverse Event eCRF, one entry to report the accidental overdose and one 
entry to report the headache.  The "Accidental overdose " and "Medication error" boxes 
would need to be checked for both entries.  
In addition, all special situations associated with atezolizumab and cabozantinib , 
regardless of whether they result in an adverse event, should be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF  as described below:  
 Accidental overdose:  Enter the drug name and "accidental overdose" as the event 
term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.  
 Intentional overdose:  Enter the drug name and "intentional overdose" as the event 
term.  Check the "Intentional overdose" box.  If drug abuse is suspected, check the 
"Drug abuse" box.  If drug abuse is not suspecte d, check the "Drug misuse" box.  
 Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the name of the drug 
administere d and a description of the error (e.g., wrong dose administered, wrong 
dosing schedule, incorrect route of administration, wrong drug, expired drug 
administered) as the event term.  Check the "Medication error" box.  
 Medication error that qualifies as an ov erdose:  Enter the drug name and "accidental 
overdose" as the event term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication 
error" boxes.  Enter a description of the error in the additional case details.  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
99/Protocol GO41892, Version 5   Intercepted medication error:  Enter the drug name an d "intercepted medication 
error" as the event term.  Check the "Medication error" box.  Enter a description of 
the error in the additional case details.  
 Drug abuse that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the drug name and "drug 
abuse" as the event ter m.  Check the "Drug abuse" box.  
 Drug abuse that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the drug name and "intentional 
overdose" as the event term.  Check the "Intentional overdose" and "Drug abuse" 
boxes.  
 Drug misuse that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the drug name and "drug 
misuse" as the event term.  Check the "Drug misuse" box.  
 Drug misuse that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the drug name and "intentional 
overdose" as the event term.  Check the "Intentional overdose" and "Drug misuse" 
boxes.  
 Drug a dministered to someone other than the patient:  Enter the drug name and 
"patient supplied drug to third party" as the event term.  Check the "Drug misuse" 
box. 
 
5.3.5.13  Patient -Reported  Outcome  Data  
Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data  (from EORTC , PRO -CTCAE 
items , and EQ -5D-5L questionnaires) , and safety analyses will not be  performed using 
PRO data.  However, if any PRO responses suggestive of a possible  adverse event are 
identified during site review of the PRO data, the investigator  will determine whether the 
criteria for an adverse event have been met and, if so, will report  the event on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  
5.3.5.14  Safety Biomarker Data   
Adverse event reports will not be derived from safety biomarker data by the Sponsor, 
and safety biomarker data will not be included in the formal safety analyses for this 
study.  In addition, safety biomarker data will not inform decisions on patient 
management.  
5.4 IMMEDIATE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FROM 
INVESTIGATOR TO SPON SOR  
Certain events require imme diate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate 
measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial.  The investigator must report 
such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take 
place more than 24 hour s after the investigator learns of the event.  The following is a list 
of events that the investigator must report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning 
of the event, regardless of relationship to study treatment : 
 Serious adverse events  (defined in  Section 5.2.2 ; see Section 5.4.2  for details on 
reporting requirements)  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
100/Protocol GO41892, Version 5   Adverse events of special interest  (defined in Section 5.2.3 ; see Section 5.4.2  for 
details on reporting requirements)  
 Pregnancies  (see Section 5.4.3  for details on rep orting requirements ) 
 
For serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest, the investigator must 
report new significant follow -up information to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more 
than 24 hours after becoming aware of the information).  N ew significant information 
includes the following:  
 New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis  
 Significant new diagnostic test results  
 Change in causality based on new information  
 Change in the event 's outcome, including recovery  
 Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event  
 
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse 
events to the local health authority and IRB/EC.  
5.4.1  Emergency Medical Contacts  
To ensure the safety of study patients, access to  Medical Monitors is available 24 hours 
per day, 7  days per week .  An Emergency Medical Call Center will also be available 
24 hours per day, 7  days per week.  The Emergency Medical Call Center will connect 
the investigator with an Emergency Medical Contact, provide medical translation 
service if necessary, and track all calls.   Contact information, including t oll-free 
numbers for the Emergency Medical Call Center , will be distributed to all 
investigators.  
5.4.2  Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events and 
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
5.4.2.1  Events That Occur  prior to  Study Treatment  Initiation  
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study treatment , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention should be reported.  
The paper Clinical Trial Adverse Event/Special Situations Form  provided to investigators 
should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor  or its designee immediat ely (i.e., no 
more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either by faxing or by scanning and 
emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators.  
5.4.2.2  Events That Occur after  Study Treatment  Initiation  
After initiation of study treatment , serious  adverse events and adverse events of special 
interest will be reported until 90 days after the  final dose of study treatment ( see 
Section  5.3.1 ) or until initiation of new systemic anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs 
first.  Investigators should record all case details that can  be gathered immediately 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
101/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  (i.e., within 24 hours after l earning of the event) on the Adverse  Event eCRF and submit 
the report via the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  A  report will be generated and 
sent to Roche Safety Risk Management by the EDC system.  
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, the paper Clinical Trial Adverse 
Event/Special Situations Form  provided to investigators should be completed and 
submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after 
learning of the event), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the 
fax number or email address provided to investigators .  Once the EDC system is 
available, all information will need to be entered and submitted via the EDC system.   
Instructions for reporting  serious adverse events that occur after the reporting period  are 
provided in Section 5.6. 
5.4.3  Reporting Requirements for Pregnancies  
5.4.3.1  Pregnancies in Female Patients  
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed through the Informed Consent 
Form  to immediately inform the investigator if they become pregnant during  the 
treatment with atezolizumab in combination with cabozantinib in the experiment al arm or 
during the treatment with docetaxel in the control arm, and for  5 months after the final 
dose of atezolizumab and/or 4 months after the final dose of cabozantinib, whichever is 
later.  The investigator should discontinue study treatment and counsel the patient, 
discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring 
of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy,  and the infant should 
have follow up for at least 6 months after birth.   
A paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be completed and submitted to 
the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
pregnancy), either by faxing o r by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number 
or email address provided to investigators.  Pregnancy should not be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.   Any serious adverse events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., 
an event in the fetus, an eve nt in the mother during or after the pregnancy, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  In addition, the investigator will submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form 
when updated information o n the course and outcome of the pregnancy becomes 
available.   
5.4.3.2  Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients   
Male patients will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately 
inform the investigator if their partner becomes pregnant duri ng the treatment with 
atezolizumab in combination with cabozantinib in the experimental arm or during the 
treatment with docetaxel in the control arm, or 4 months after the  final dose of 
cabozantinib , or 6 months  after the final dose of docetaxel .  The investigator should 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
102/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  report the pregnancy on the  paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form and submit 
the form to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after 
learning of the pregnancy), either by faxing or by scanning and  emailing the form using 
the fax number or email address provided to investigators.  Attempts should be made to 
collect and report details of the course and outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a 
male patient exposed to study treatment .  When permitt ed by the site, the pregnant 
partner would  need to sign an Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health 
Information to allow for follow -up on her pregnancy  and the infant for at least 6 months 
after birth .  If the authorization has been signed,  the investigator should  submit a Clinical 
Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form with additional  information on the  pregnant partner and 
the course and outcome of the pregnancy  as it becomes available.  An investigator who 
is contacted by the male patient or his pregnant partner may provide information on the 
risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus, to support an informed 
decision in cooperation with the treating physician  and/or obstetrician.  
5.4.3.3  Abortions  
A spontaneous abortion should be classif ied as a serious adverse event (as  the Sponsor 
considers abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event; see Section  5.4.2 ). 
If a therapeutic or elective abortion was performed because of an underlying maternal or 
embryofetal toxicity, the toxicity should be classified as a serious adverse event, 
recorded on the A dverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no 
more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).  A therapeutic  or 
elective abortion performed for reasons other than an underlying maternal or 
embryofetal toxicity is not considered an adverse event.  
All abortions should be reported as pregnancy outcomes on the paper Clinical Trial 
Pregnancy Reporting Form.  
5.4.3.4  Congenit al Anomalies /Birth Defects  
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study 
treatment  or the female partner of a male patient exposed to study treatment  should be 
classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on th e Adverse Event eCRF, and 
reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
event; see Section 5.4.2 ). 
5.5 FOLLOW -UP OF  PATIENTS AFTER ADVE RSE EVENTS  
5.5.1  Investigator Follow -Up 
The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline 
grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is lost to 
follow -up, or the patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
103/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  serious adverse events considered to be related to study treatment  or trial -related 
procedures until a final outcome can be reported.  
During the study period, resolution of ad verse events (with dates) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient's medical record to facilitate source data 
verification.  
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome  
(see Section  5.4.3 ). 
5.5.2  Sponsor Follow -Up 
For serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, and pregnancies, the 
Sponsor or a designee may follow  up by telephone,  fax, email, and/or a monitoring visit 
to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g.,  from hospital discharge 
summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent 
medical assessment of the reported case.  
5.6 ADVE RSE EVENTS THAT OCCU R AFTER THE ADVERSE 
EVENT REPORTING PERI OD 
After the end of the reporting period for serious adverse events and adverse events of 
special interest (defined as 90 days after the final dose of study treatment or until 
initiation of new systemic anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first ), all deaths, 
regardless of cause, should be reported through use o f the Long -Term Survival 
Follow -Up eCRF.   
In addition, if the investigator becomes aware of a serious adverse event that is believed 
to be related to prior exposure to study treatment, the event should be reported through 
use of the Adverse Event eCRF.   However, if the EDC system is not available, the 
investigator should report these eve nts directly to the Sponsor or its designee, either by 
faxing or by scanning and emailing the paper Clinical Trial Adverse Event/Special 
Situations Form  using the fax number or email address provided to investigators.  
5.7 EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEALTH AUTHORIT IES, 
INVESTIGATORS, I NSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARDS, 
AND  ETHICS COMMITTEES  
The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all serious adverse events and adverse events of 
special interest against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously 
communicate poss ible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and applicable 
health authorities based on applicable legislation.  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
104/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events through us e of the reference safety 
information in the document s listed below:  
Drug  Document  
Atezolizumab  Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure   
Cabozantinib  Cabozantinib Investigator's Brochure  
Docetaxel  Taxotere EMA SmPC   
 
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the 
applicable reference document.  
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed.  
An iDMC will monitor the incidence of the above -listed anticipated events during the 
study.  An aggregate report of any clinically relevant imbalances that do not favor the 
test product will be submitt ed to health authorities.  
6. STATISTICAL CONSIDERA TIONS AND ANALYSIS P LAN 
This is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, open -label study designed to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of Atezo   Cabo compared with docetaxel 
monotherapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC, with no sensitizing EGFR  mutation or 
ALK translocation, who have progressed following treatment with platinum -containing 
chemotherapy and antiPD-L1/PD -1 antibody , administered concurre ntly or sequentially.  
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the intent -to-treat (ITT) population  (i.e., all 
randomized patients) , with patients grouped according to the treatment assigned at 
randomization, regardless of whether they received any assigned  study drug.   
Safety analyses will be performed on all randomized patients who received any amount 
of study drug , with patients grouped according to the  actual treatment received.  
Specifically, a patient will be included in the Atezo   Cabo  arm in the safety analyses if 
the patient receives any amount of atezo lizumab  or cabo zantinib , regardless of the initial 
treatment assignment at randomization.  
Details of the planned analyses will be provided in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan  
(SAP)  that will be finalized before any analysis of the primary endpoint is performed.  
6.1 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE  
The study is designed to test the hypothesis that atezolizumab in combination with 
cabozantinib  prolongs the duration of OS compared to the contro l arm (docetaxel)  in the 
ITT population . 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
105/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  The sample size determination is based on the number of events required to 
demonstrate efficacy with regard to OS (as defined in S ection 6.4.1 ) in the ITT 
population.  The estimate of the number of events required is based on the following 
assumptions:   
 1:1 randomization ratio  
 OS curve that follow s the exponential distributions  
 Two-sided significance level of 0.0 5 for the comparison of OS  
 90% power to detect an HR of 0.6 4 in OS  in the ITT population , corresponding to an 
improvement in median OS from 9 to 14.1 months  
 One planned interim analys is of OS  
The interim analysis of OS is to be performed when  approximately 83% 
of the total number of OS events required for the final analysis are 
expect ed to have occurred .  Crossing boundaries are determined based on 
the Hwang -Shih-DeCani alpha spending funct ion with the gamma parameter 
of 2.5 (Hwang et al. 1990) .   
 Accrual duration of approximately 16 months  
 Dropout rate of 5% per 24 months for each treatment arm for OS  
 
With these assumptions, approximately 350 patients (approximately 175 per arm) in total 
will be randomized into the study.  The interim OS analysis will be conducted after 
approximately 182 OS events have occurred.  The final OS analysis will be conducted 
when approximately 220 OS events  have occurred , which is expected to occur 
approximately 28 months after the first patient is enrolled.  This number of final OS 
events corresponds to a minimum detectable difference corresponding to an HR of 
approximately 0. 757. 
6.2 SUMMARIES OF CONDUCT  OF STUDY  
Study enrollment, study drug administration , reasons for discontinuation from the study 
drug, and reasons for study termination will be summarized by treatment arm.  Major 
protocol deviations, including major deviations of inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be 
reported and summarized by treatment a rm. 
6.3 SUMMARIES OF TREATME NT GROUP COMPARABILI TY 
Demographic characteristics, such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, and baseline disease 
characteristics (e.g., ECOG performance status , smoking status ), will be summarized by 
treatment arms.  Descriptive statistic s (mean, median, standard deviation , and range) 
will be presented for continuous data, and frequencies and percentages will be 
presented for categorical data.  
Baseline measurements are the last available data obtained prior to the patient receiving 
the fir st dose of any component of study drug , unless otherwise noted . 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
106/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  6.4 EFFICACY ANALYSIS  
The analysis population for the efficacy analyses will consist of all randomized patients  
(i.e., the ITT population) , with patients grouped according to their assigned treatment.  
6.4.1  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is OS. 
OS is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause.  Data for patients 
who are not reported as having died at the time of analysis will be censored at  the date 
when they were last known to be alive.  Data fo r patients who do not have post baseline 
information will be censored at the date of randomization.  The primary endpoint of OS 
will be compared between treatment arms with the use of the stratified l og-rank test.  If 
the estimate of the HR is  1 and the two -sided p -value corresponding to the stratified 
log-rank test is less than the specified  level, then the null hypothesis will be rejected , 
and it will be concluded that the combination of Atezo   Cabo prolongs the duration of 
OS relative to the control treatment.  The HR and associated 95% CI will be estimated 
using a stratified Cox proportional hazard model.  The stratification factors will be the 
same as those recorded in the IxRS  at randomizatio n (Section  3.1).  Results from an 
unstratified analysis will also be provided.  
Kaplan -Meier methodology will be used to estimate the median OS for each treatment 
arm, and Kaplan -Meier curves will be constru cted to provide a visual description of the 
difference between treatment arms .  Brookmeyer -Crowley methodology will be used to 
construct the 95% CI of the median OS for each treatment arm  (Brookmeyer  and 
Crowley 1982) .   
One interim analys is is planned for  OS.  The timing and stopping boundaries of the OS 
analyses are described in the sections of sample size determination  (Section 6.1) and 
planned interim  analyses  (Section  6.10.1 ).   
To assess the consistency of the study results in s ubgroups defined by demographic 
(e.g., age, sex, and race/ethnicity) an d baseline characteristics ( e.g., ECOG 
Performance Status , histology , and PD -L1 status ), the primary efficacy endpoint in 
these  subgroups will  be examined.   Additional analyses may be performed to evaluate 
the potential effect of non protocol -specified anti -cancer therapy on OS.  Detail s of 
these analys es will be provided in the SAP.  
6.4.2  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
6.4.2.1  Progression -Free Survival as Assessed by the In vestigator  
PFS is defined as time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease  progression 
as determined by investigator  per RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause (whichever 
occurs first).  Patients who are alive and have not experienced disease progression at 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
107/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  the time of analysis will be censored at the time of last tumor assessment.   Patients with 
no postbaseline tumor assessment will be censored at the date of randomization.  
Additional analyses  may be performed to assess the potential impact of intercurrent 
events (e.g., missing scheduled tumor assessments ) on PFS .  Details of these  analyses 
will be provided in the SAP.  
The methodologies outlined for the primary analysis of OS will be used for the analyses 
of PFS by the  investigator . 
6.4.2.2  Objective Response Rate  as Assessed by the Investigator  
ORR , defined as the proportion of patients with a CR or PR on two consecutive 
occasions  4 weeks apart, as determined by  the investigator according to RECIST  v1.1.  
Patients not meeting these criteria, including patients without any postbaseline tumor 
assess ment, will be considered non -responders.   ORR will be analyzed in the 
randomized patients with measurable disease at baseline.  
An estimate of ORR and its 95% CI will be calculated using the Clopper Pearson method 
for each treatment arm.  CIs for the differ ence in ORRs between the two treatment  arms 
will be determined using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.  The ORR 
will be compared between the two arms using the stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel 
test, stratified by the same factors use d in the primary OS analysis (see Section  6.4.1 ). 
6.4.2.3  Duration of Response  as Assessed by the Investigator  
DOR will be assessed in patients who had a confirmed objective response as 
determined by the investigator using RECIST  v1.1.  DOR is defined as the time from the 
date of the first occurrence of a confirmed CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) 
until the first date that PD or death is docume nted, whichever occurs first.  Patients who 
have not progressed and who have not died at the time of analysis will be censored at 
the time of last tumor assessment date.  If no tumor assessments were performed after 
the date of the first occurrence of a CR  or PR, DOR will be censored at the date of the 
first occurrence of a CR or PR .  DOR is based on a non -randomized subset of patients 
(specifically, patients who achieved an objective response); therefore, formal hypothesis 
testing will not be performed for  this endpoint.  Comparisons between treatment arms 
will be made for descriptive purposes.  The methodologies detailed for the OS analysis 
will be used for the DOR analysis.  
6.4.2.4  Time to Confirmed Physical Function  or Health -Related Quality 
of Life Deterioratio n 
Time to confirmed PF or HRQoL deterioration or worsening is defined as the time from 
the date of randomization to the first date of 10 -point or more decrease on either the 
EORTC QLQ -C30 PF or GHS scale scores (range, 0 100) held for two consecutive 
assessments, or a 10 -point or more score decrease followed by death (any cause) within 
21 days  or within time till next tumor assessment , whichever occurs first.  Confirmed 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
108/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  function or HRQo L deterioration was selected as the event in order to increase the 
specificity of the endpoints in capturing clinical deterioration due to tumor progression 
rather than experience of early adverse events that could transiently impact these two 
concepts.  
Patients who do not have a ≥10 -point score decrease will be censored at the last 
assessment date.  Pati ents without a baseline or post baseline PRO assessment will be 
censored at the randomization  date. 
All randomized patients will be included in th is time to confirmed deterioration analyses.  
The methodologies outlined for t he analysis of OS will be used for these analyses.  
6.4.2.5  Progression -Free Survival Assessed by Investigator at 
Landmark Timepoints  
The PFS rates at 6 months  and 1 year assessed by investigator will be estimated using 
Kaplan -Meier methodology for each treatment a rm, along with 95% CIs calculated using 
the standard error derived from Greenwood’s formula.  The 95%  CI for the difference in 
PFS rates between the two  treatment arms will be estimated using the normal 
approximation method.  
6.4.2.6  Overall Survival Rate at Landmark Timepoints  
The OS rates at 1 and 2 years will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier methodology for 
each treatment arm, along with 95% CIs calculated using the standard error derived 
from Greenwood’s formula.  The 95%  CI for the difference in OS rates between the 
two treatment arms will be estimated using the normal approximation method.  
6.4.3  Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
Exploratory analyses of patient -reported function, symptoms , and functions will be 
detailed in the SAP and will include documentation of scales completion compliance, 
longitudinal analyses of mean changes in score from baseline , and proportion of patients 
reporting meaningful changes on each score at each assessment visit , end of treatment, 
tumor progression , or clinical progression  and wil l be presented by treatment arm .  
Analyses will be perfo rmed in the ITT population.  
6.5 SAFETY ANALYSES  
Safety analyses will be performed on the safety -evaluable population, which is defined 
as all randomized patients who receive any amount of the study drug .  Specifically, a 
patient will be included in the Atezo   Cabo  experimental arm in the safety analyses if the 
patient receives any amount of atezolizumab  or cabozantinib , regardless of the initial 
treatment assignment at randomization.  
Safety endpoints will include the incidence and severity of adverse events, with severity 
determined according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0, including serious adverse events and 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
109/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  adverse events of special interest, and clinical laboratory results following the 
administration of study drugs.  Drug exposure will be summarized, including duration, 
dosage, and dose intensity.  Verbatim description of adverse events will be mapped to 
the MedDRA thesaurus terms and graded according the NCI  CTCAE v5.0.  All adverse 
events  will be summarized by treatment arm and NCI CTCAE grade.  In  addition, serious 
adverse events and adverse events leading to study treatment discontinuation or 
interruption will be summarized accordingly.  Multiple occurrence of the same event will 
be coun ted once at the maximum severity.  Laboratory data with values outside of the 
normal ranges will be identified.  Additionally, selected laboratory data, including ADA 
results, will be summarized by treatment arm.  Deaths and causes of deaths will be 
summar ized.  
6.5.1  Exploratory Analyses of Patient -Reported Outcome Data  
Analyses using PRO data (collected through selected items from the PRO -CTCAE  item 
library  and the overall tolerability item ) will be descriptive, with a focus on characterizing 
the pattern of sym ptomatic treatment toxicities over the course of the study.  Results 
from these exploratory analyses will be presented separately from the other safety 
analyses.  PRO  data will be analyzed at the item level .   
PRO  data will be summarized over time  includin g the number and percentage of patients 
reporting each symptom and the change from baseline at each assessment timepoint , 
including end of treatment,  by treatment arm.  In addition , the maximum postbaseline 
score and change from baseline will be summarized  by treatment arm.  Details of these 
analyses will be described in the SAP.  
6.6 PHARMACOKINETIC ANAL YSES   
PK samples will be collected in this study as outlined in Appendix  2.  Atezolizumab  
serum concentration data (C min and C max) will be tabulated and summarized.  Descriptive 
statistics will include means, medians, ranges, and standard deviations , as appropriate.  
Plasma concentrations of cabozantinib will be collected in this study as outlined in  
Appendix  2.  The concentrations of cabozantinib will be summarized us ing descriptive 
statistics as described above.  
Additional PK analyses, including population PK and exploratory exposure response 
analysis, may be conducted, as appropriate, based on the availability of data . 
6.7 IMMUNOGENICITY ANALY SES  
The immunogenicity analysis population will consist of all patients with at least one ADA  
assessment for atezolizumab.  The numbers and proportions of ADA -positive patients 
and ADA -negative patients at baseline (baseline prevalence) and after drug 
administration (postbaselin e incidence) will be summarized.  Summary of baseline 
prevalence will be based on patients with at least one evaluable baseline ADA 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
110/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  assessment; summary of postbaseline incidence will be based on treated patients with 
at least one evaluable postbaseline ADA  assessment.  Patients will be grouped 
according to treatment received.  
When determining postbaseline incidence, patients are considered to be ADA positive if 
they are ADA negative or have missing data at baseline but develop an ADA response 
following stud y drug exposure (treatment -induced ADA response), or if they are ADA 
positive at baseline and the titer of one or more postbaseline s amples is at least 
0.60 titer unit greater than the titer of the baseline sample (treatment -enhanced ADA 
response).  Patien ts are considered to be post -treatment ADA negative if they are ADA 
negative or have missing data at baseline and all postbaseline samples are negative, or 
if they are ADA positive at baseline but do not have any postbaseline samples with a 
titer that is a t least 0.60 titer unit greater than the titer of the baseline sample (treatment 
unaffected).  
The relationship between ADA status and safety, efficacy, and PK endpoints may be 
analyzed and reported via descriptive statistics.  
6.8 BIOMARKER ANALYSES   
Although n o formal statistical analysis of exploratory biomarkers will be performed, data 
may be analyzed in the context of this study and in aggregate with data from other 
studies.  Results from these exploratory biomarker analyses may be reported separately 
from t he CSR . 
6.9 HEALTH STATUS UTILIT Y ANALYSES   
Change from baseline in EQ-5D-5L health utility index -based and VAS scores will be 
calculated at specified timepoints  and will inform pharmacoeconomic models.  As such, 
the data will not be reported in the CSR.  
6.10 INTERIM ANALYSES  
6.10.1  Planned Interim Analyses  
One interim analys is is planned for OS.  To control the type I error for OS at two -sided 
alpha of 0.05, the stopping boundaries for OS interim and final analyses are to be 
computed with use of the Hwang -Shih-DeCani alpha spending function with the gamma 
parameter of 2.5 as shown in  Table  7.

Due to logistical considerations in event ascertainment and operational plannin g and 
conduct, the actual analyses may include more or fewer events than the target 
information fractions.  The actual critical values employed at the interim and final 
analyses of OS will depend upon the actual information fraction at the time of the 
analyses.  
7. DATA COLLECTION AND M ANAGEMENT  
7.1 DATA QUALITY ASSURAN CE 
The Sponsor will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality 
checking of the data.  Data entered manually will be collected via EDC through use of 
eCRFs.  Sites will be re sponsible for data entry into the EDC system.  In the event of 
discrepant data, the Sponsor will request data clarification from the sites, which the sites 
will resolve electronically in the EDC system.  
The Sponsor will produce an EDC Study Specification d ocument that describes the 
quality checking to be performed on the data.  Central laboratory data will be sent 
directly to the Sponsor, using the Sponsor 's standard procedures to handle and process 
the electronic transfer of these data.  
eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system 's audit trail.  
System backups for data stored by the Sponsor and records retention for the study data 
will be consistent with the Sponsor 's standard procedures.  
PRO questionnaires will be compl eted on paper questionnaires provided by the 
Sponsor.  Sites are responsible to ensure that the self - or interviewer -administered 
questionnaires are complete and accurate and administered prior to receipt of any 
information that might bias patients’ rating s, and prior to the administration of study 
treatment.   If any of the questionnaires is not completed when scheduled for completion, 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
112/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  then the site should report the reason for non -completion in the eCRF.  Site will enter the 
data via EDC system.  
7.2 ELECTRONIC  CASE REPORT FORMS   
eCRFs are to be completed through use of a Sponsor -designated EDC system.  Sites 
will receive t raining and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion.  
eCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor  and should be han dled in 
accordance with instructions from the Sponsor . 
All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff.  eCRFs should be 
reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee.  
At the end of the study, the investigat or will receive patient data for his or her site in a 
readable format that must be kept with the study records.  Acknowledgement of receipt 
of the data is required.  
7.3 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENT ATION  
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification  and review  to confirm that 
critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site 
personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source  documents.  
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded 
and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, PROs , evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments , copies  of 
transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, 
microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, patient files, 
and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico -technical  depa rtments 
involved in a clinical trial.  
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be 
entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no pri or written or electronic record of the data) and 
considered source data.  
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per 
the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.5. 
To facilitate source data verification  and review , the investigators and institutions must 
provide the Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for 
trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The study  site must also 
allow inspection by applicable health authorities.  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
113/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  7.4 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS  
When clinical observations are entered directly into a  study  site's computeriz ed medical 
record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve 
as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health 
authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clini cal research.  An 
acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry 
of data.  If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail 
that shows the original data as well as the reason for the  change, name of the person 
making the change, and date of the change.  
7.5 RETENTION OF RECORDS  
Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of 
IMP, including  eCRFs, electronic or paper PRO  data (if  applicable), Informed C onsent 
Forms, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by the 
Principal Investigator for 15  years after completion or discontinuation of the study  or for 
the length of time required by relevant national or local health au thorities, whichever is 
longer.  After that period of time, the documents may be destroyed, subject  to local 
regulations.   
No records may be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor.  Written 
notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to 
another party or moving them to another location.  
Roche will retain study data for 25 years after the final study results have been reported 
or for the length of time required by relevant national or local health author ities, 
whichever is longer.

114/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  8.2 INFORMED CONSENT  
The Sponsor 's sample Informed Consent Form (and ancillary sample Informed Consent 
Forms such as a n Assent Form or MN Informed Consent Form, if  applicable) will be 
provided to each site.  If applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of the 
local languag e.  The Sponsor or its designee must review and approve any proposed 
deviations from the Sponsor's sample Informed Consent Forms or any alternate consent 
forms proposed by the site (collectively, the "Consent Forms") before IRB/EC 
submission.  The final IR B/ECapproved Consent Forms must be provided to the 
Sponsor for health authority submission purposes according to local requirements.  
If applicable, the Informed Consent Form will contain separate sections for any optional 
procedures.  The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each patient the 
objectives, methods, and potential risks associated with each optional procedure.  
Patients will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their 
consent at any time for any rea son.  A separate, specific signature will be required to 
document a patient's agreement to participate in optional procedures.  Patients who 
decline to participate will not provide a separate signature.  
The Consent Forms must be signed and dated by the pat ient or the patient's legally 
authorized representative before his or her participation in the study.  The case history or 
clinical records for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that 
written informed consent was obtained prior to  participation in the study.  
The Consent Forms should be revised whenever there are changes to study procedures 
or when new information becomes available that may affect the willingness of the patient 
to participate.  The final revised IRB/EC -approved Cons ent Forms must be provided to 
the Sponsor for health authority submission purposes.  
If the Consent Forms are revised (through an amendment or an addendum) while a 
patient is participating in the study, the patient or a legally authorized representative 
must re-consent by signing the most current version of the Consent Forms or the 
addendum, in accordance with applicable laws and IRB/EC policy.  For any updated or 
revised Consent Forms, the case history or clinical records for each patient shall 
document the  informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained 
using the updated/revised Consent Forms for continued participation in the study.  
A copy of each signed Consent Form must be provided to the patient or the patient's 
legally authorize d representative.  All signed and dated Consent Forms must remain in 
each patient's study file or in the site file and must be available for verification by study 
monitors at any time.  
For sites in the United States, each Consent Form may also include pati ent authorization 
to allow use and disclosure of personal health information in compliance with the U.S. 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
115/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  (HIPAA)  of 1996.  If the site utilizes a 
separate Authorization Form for patient authorization for use and disclosure of personal 
health information under the HIPAA regulations, the review, approval, and  other 
processes outlined above apply except that IRB review and approval may not be 
required per study site policies.  
8.3 INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW  BOARD OR ETH ICS COMMITTEE  
This protocol, the Informed Consent Forms, any information to be given to the patient, 
and relevant supporting information must be submitted to the IRB/EC by the Principal 
Investigator and reviewed and approved by the IRB/EC before the study is initiated.  
In addition, any patient recruitment materials must be approved by the IRB/EC.  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for providing written summaries of the status of 
the study to the IRB/EC annually or more frequently in accordance with  the 
requirements, policies, and procedures established by the IRB/EC.  Investigators are 
also responsible for promptly informing the IRB/EC of any protoc ol amendments (see 
Section  9.7). 
In addition to the requirements for reporting all adverse events to the Sponsor, 
investigators must comply with requirements for reporting serious adverse events to the 
local health authority and IRB/EC.  Investigators may receive written IND safety reports 
or other safety -related communications from the Sponsor .  Investigators are responsible 
for ensuring that such reports are reviewed and processed in accordance with health 
authority requirements and the policies and procedures established by their IRB/EC , and 
archived in the site 's study file.  
8.4 CONFIDENTIALITY  
Information technology systems used to collect, process, and store study -related data 
are secured by technical and organizational security measures designed to protect such 
data against accidental or unlawful loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure or 
access.  In the event of a data security breach, appropriate mitigation measures will be 
implemented.  
The Sponsor maintains confidentiality standards by coding  each patient enrolled in the 
study through assignment of a unique patient identification number.  This means that 
patient names are not included in data sets that are transmitted to any Sponsor  location.  
Patient medical information obtained by this study is confidential and may be disclosed 
to third parties only as permitted by the Informed Consent Form (or  separate 
authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by the 
patient, unless permitted or required by law.  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
116/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  Medical infor mation may be given to a patient's personal physician or other appropriate 
medical personnel responsible for the patient's welfare, for treatment purposes.  
Given the complexity and exploratory nature of exploratory biomarker analyses, data 
derived from these analyses will generally not be provided to study investigators or 
patients unless required by law.  The aggregate results of any conducted research will 
be available in accordance with the effective Sponsor policy on study data publi cation 
(see Section  9.6). 
Data generated by this study must be available for inspection upon request by 
representatives of national and local health authorities, Sponsor monitors, 
representatives, and collaborators, and the IRB/EC for each study site, as appropriate.  
Study data  which may include data on genomic variants  may be submitted to 
government or other health research databases or shared with researchers, government 
agencies, companies, or other groups that are  not participating in this study.  These data 
may be combined with or linked to other data and used for research purposes, to 
advance science and public health, or for analysis, development, and commercialization 
of products to treat and diagnose disease.  In addition, redacted CSRs  and other 
summary reports will be provided upon request (see Section  9.6). 
8.5 FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE  
Investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial information in 
accordance with local regulations to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and accurate 
financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate health authorities.  
Investigators are  responsible for providing information on financial interests during the 
course of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study ( see definition of end of 
study in Section 3.2). 
9. STUDY DOCUMENTATION, MONITORING, AND 
ADMINISTRATION  
9.1 STUDY DOCUMENTATION  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of 
the study to be fully documented, including, but not limited to, the protocol, protocol 
amendments, Informed Consent Forms, and documentation of IRB/EC and 
governmental approval.  In addition, at the end of the study, the investigator will receive 
the patient data, including an  audit trail containing a co mplete record of all changes 
to data.  
9.2 PROTOCOL DEVIATION S 
The investigator should document and explain any protocol deviations.   The investigator 
should promptly report any deviations that might have an impact on patient safety and 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
117/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  data integrity to the Sponsor and to the IRB/EC in accordance with established IRB/EC 
policies and procedures.  The Sponsor will review all protocol deviations and assess 
whether any represent a serious breach of Good Clinical Practice guidelines and r equire 
reporting to health authorities.  As per the Sponsor's standard operating procedures, 
prospective requests to deviate from the protocol, including requests to waive protocol 
eligibility criteria, are not allowed.  
9.3 MANAGEMENT OF STUDY QUALITY  
The Spon sor will implement a system to manage the quality of the study, focusing on 
processes and data that are essential to ensuring patient safety and data integrity.  Prior 
to study initiation, the Sponsor will identify potential risks associated with critical trial 
processes and data and will implement plans for evaluating and controlling these risks.  
Risk evaluation and control will include the selection of risk -based parameters 
(e.g.,  adverse event rate, protocol deviation rate) and the establishment of qual ity 
tolerance limits for these parameters prior to study initiation.  Detection of deviations 
from quality tolerance limits will trigger an evaluation to determine if action is needed.  
Details on the establishment and monitoring of quality tolerance limit s will be provided in 
a Quality Tolerance Limit Management Plan.  
9.4 ADMINISTRATIVE STRUC TURE  
This trial will be sponsored and managed by F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd.  The Sponsor 
will provide clinical operations management, data management, and medical monitorin g. 
Approximately 125 sites globally will participate to randomize approximately 
350 patients.  Screening, enrollment, and treatment assignment will occur through an 
IxRS.   
Central facilities will be used for certain study assessments throughout the study 
(e.g.,  specified laboratory tests, biomarker analyses, and PK analyses), as specified in 
Section 4.5.7 .  Accredited local laboratories will be used for routine monitoring; local 
laboratory ranges will be collected.  
An iDMC  will monitor and evaluate patient safety and will review the interim analysis for 
OS.  Tumor response and progression will be evaluated by investigators.   
9.5 SITE INSPECTIONS  
Site visits will be conducted by the Sponsor or an authorized representative for 
inspection of study data, patients ' medical records, and eCRFs.  The investigator will 
permit national and local health authorities; Sponsor monitors, representatives, and 
collaborators; and the IRBs/ECs to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study.

Notes:  On treatment days, all assessments should be performed prior to dosing, unless otherwise specified.  
a Results of standard -of-care tests or examinations performed prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior 
to Day 1 may be used; such tests do not need to be repeated for screening.  
b Informed consent must be documented before any study -specific screening procedure is performed and may be obtained 
more than 28 days before initiation of study treat ment.  
c Representative fresh and archival tumor tissue sample obtained at baseline for exploratory research on biomarkers (e.g., 
PD-L1 status via central testing), including biomarker assay development.   Tumor tissue samples should be submitted 
before or within 4 weeks of randomization.   
d If no tissue specimen is available, known PD -L1 status , as defined by a health  authorityapproved PD -L1 assay , is 
required . 
e For patients with non squamous NSCLC histo logy with unknown EGFR  and/or ALK status, test results are required at 
screening.  EGFR  and/or ALK status must be assessed locally or at a central laboratory.  If samples are submitted for 
central testing, a dditional tissue sample is required.  See laboratory manual for details.  
f At screening, patients will be tested for HIV, HBsAg, total HBcAb, and HCV antibody .  If a patient has a negative HBsAg 
test and a positive total HBcAb test at screening, an HBV DNA test must also be performed to determine if the patient 
has an HBV infection.  If a patient has a positive HCV antibody test at screening, an HCV RNA test must also be 
performed to determine if the patient has an HCV infection.   
g Includes respiratory rate, pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blo od pressure, and temperature.  For the first infusion of 
atezolizumab, vital signs should be measured within 60  minutes prior to the infusion , after the infusion of atezolizumab 
but prior to the administration of cabozantinib, and, if clinically indicated,  every 15  ( 5) minutes during the infusion and at 
30 ( 10) minutes after the infusion.  For subsequent infusions of atezolizumab, vital signs should be measured within

supplements) used by a patient in addition to protocol -mandated treatment from 7 days prior to initiation of study 
treatment until the treatment discontinuation visit.  
t After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study treatment, only serious adverse events caused 
by a protocol -mandated intervention should be reported.  After initiation of study treatmen t, all adverse events will be 
reported until 30  days  after the final dose of study treatment or until initiation of new systemic anti -cancer therapy, 
whichever occurs first, and serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest will continue to  be reported 
until 90 days after the final dose of study treatment or until initiation of new systemic anti -cancer therapy, whichever 
occurs first.  After this period, all deaths, regardless of cause, should be reported.  In addition, the Sponsor should be  
notified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious adverse event that is believed to be related to prior exposure to 
study treatment.  
u The initial infusion of atezolizumab will be delivered over 60 (  15) minutes.  Subsequent infusions will be del ivered over 
30 ( 10) minutes if the previous infusion was tolerated without infusion -associated adverse events, or 60 (  15) minutes if 
the patient experienced an infusion -associated adverse event with the previous infusion.  
v Cabozantinib tablets will be  given on Day 1 of Cycle 1 after atezolizumab infusion.  Patients will take tablets once daily at 
home thereafter until study treatment is discontinued.  
w For docetaxel, study drug will be administered according to the local prescribing information, includ ing premedication with 
steroids.  
x PRO assessments (EORTC QLQ -C30, EORTC IL17,  EORTC QLQ -LC13, EORTC IL46,  selected items from the PRO -
CTCAE and EQ -5D-5L questionnaires ) will be completed before the patient receives any information on disease status 
and pr ior to the performance of non -PRO assessments that could bias patients’ rating and the administration of study 
treatment.  Study personnel should confirm all questionnaires for completeness before the patient leaves the 
investigational site.  
y Patient -comp leted questionnaires should be completed by the patients prior to any assessments, tests or interactions 
that might bias patients’ view on their health status.   
z PRO assessments (EORTC QLQ -C30, EORTC QLQ -LC13, EORTC IL46, selected items from the PRO -CTCAE, and 
EQ-5D-5L) will be completed  at the post treatment follow up visit .  Completion of PRO questionnaires will no longer be 
required  after the final OS analysis.    
aa Patients will undergo a tumor biopsy sample collection, if deemed clinically feasible by the investigator, at the time of first 
evidence of radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1.  Biopsies should be performed within 40  days after 
progression or prior to th e next anti -cancer therapy, whichever is sooner.  
Appendix 1: Schedule of Activities    
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
132/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  bb Biopsies collected at the investigator’s discretion are preferred at the time of clinical events (e.g., clinical response).  
Patients must sign a separate Optional Biopsy Informed Consent Form to undergo optional biopsies.  See Section 4.5.10  
for details.  
cc Tumor assessments performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to 
initiation of study treatment do not have to be repeated at scre ening.  All known sites of disease, including measurable 
and/or non -measurable disease, must be documented at screening and re -assessed at each subsequent tumor 
evaluation.   Screening assessments must include CT scans (with oral or IV contrast) of chest, a bdomen, and pelvis, as 
wells as  a CT scan (with oral or IV contrast) or MRI of the head.  If a CT scan with contrast is contraindicated (e.g., in 
patients with impaired renal clearance), a non -contrast CT scan of the chest must be performed and MRI scans o f the 
abdomen, pelvis, and head must be performed.  A CT scan with contrast or MRI scan of the head must be done at 
screening to evaluate CNS metastasis in all patients (MRI scan must be performed if CT scan is contraindicated).  An 
MRI scan of the head is  required to confirm or refute the diagnosis of CNS metastases at baseline in the event of an 
equivocal CT scan.  At subsequent (post -screening) tumor assessments, patients with a history of irradiat ed brain 
metastasis at screening are not required to unde rgo brain scan unless clinically indicated.  The same radiographic 
modality (e.g., CT scan with contrast) and procedures ( e.g., the same contrast protocol for CT scans) used to assess 
disease sites at screening should be used for subsequent tumor assessmen ts.  Bone scans and CT scans of the neck 
should also be performed at screening , if clinically indicated.  
dd All patients will undergo tumor assessments at baseline, every 6 weeks (  7 days)  for the first 48  weeks following Day 1 
of Cycle 1, and every 9 weeks ( 7 days) after completion of the Week 48 tumor assessment regardless of treatment 
delays. Patients will continue scanning regardless of treatment delays until radiographic disease progression per RECIST 
v1.1 (or loss of clinical benefit for  patients who continue study treatment after disease progression per RECIST v1.1), 
withdrawal of consent, death, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first .  Patients in the experimental 
arm who are treated beyond disease progression per R ECIST v1.1 will continue to undergo tumor assessments at the 
frequency described above until (i.e. , every 6 weeks [  7 days]  for the first 48  weeks  and every 9  weeks [  7 days]  after 
48 weeks) until study treatment is discontinued. Patients who discontinu e treatment for reasons other than radiographic 
disease progression per RECIST v1.1 (e.g., toxicity, symptomatic deterioration) will continue scheduled tumor 
assessments at the frequency described above until radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1. 1, withdrawal of 
consent, death, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first. In the absence of radiographic disease 
progression per RECIST v1.1, tumor assessments should continue regardless of whether a patient starts a new anti -
cancer therapy.  
Appendix 1: Schedule of Activities    
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
133/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  ee All measurable and evaluable lesions should be re -assessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.   The same 
radiographic procedures used to assess disease sites at screening should be used for subsequent tumor assessments 
(e.g., the same contrast protocol for CT  scans).  
ff After treatment discontinuation, information on survival follow -up and new ant i-cancer therapy (including targeted therapy 
and immunotherapy) will be collected via telephone calls, patient medical records, and/or clinic visits approximately every 
3 months  (every 12 weeks [  7 days])  or more frequently  until death (unless the patient  withdraws consent or the Sponsor 
terminates the study).   After completion of final OS analysis, patients will only need to be followed for 6 months after 
the last dose of study treatment  and i nformation on new anti -cancer therapy will also no longer be re quire d.  If a 
patient requests to be withdrawn from follow -up, this request must be documented in the source documents and signed 
by the investigator.  If the patient withdraws from the study, the study staff may use a public information source (e.g., 
county records)  to obtain information about survival status only.  
gg For patients in either arm at participating sites who have provided written informed consent to participate in mobile 
nursing visits, this assessment or procedure may be performed by a trained nursing professional at the patient's home or 
another suitable location . 
hh On the basis of emerging safety, activity, or efficacy data, the number of PK  and ADA samples may be reduced or 
sample collection may cease altogether.  Additionally, collected samples may  not be analyzed if not warranted.   After 
final OS analysis is conducted, the Sponsor may decide to no longer collect additional biomarker samples.  The 
existing collected samples may still be used for exploratory analysis.

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors , 
Version  1.1 (RECIST v1.1)   
Selected sections from the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version  1.1 
(RECIST v1.1),  (Eisenhauer et al. 2009)  are presented below, with slight modifications 
from the original publication and the addition of explanatory text as needed for clarity.1 
TUMOR MEASURABILITY  
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable or 
non-measurable as described below.  All measurable and non -measurable lesions 
should be assessed at screening and at subseq uent protocol -specified tumor 
assessment timepoints.  Additional assessments may be performed as clinically 
indicated for suspicion of progression.  
DEFINITION OF MEASUR ABLE LESIONS  
Tumor Lesions  
Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dim ension (longest diameter 
in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size as follows:  
 10 mm by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan 
(CT/MRI scan slice thickness/interval  5 mm)  
 10-mm caliper measurement by c linical examination (lesions that cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable)  
 20 mm by chest X -ray 
 
Malignant Lymph Nodes  
To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be 
 15 mm in the short axis when assessed by CT  scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be  5 mm).  At  baseline and follow -up, only the short axis will be 
measured and followed.  Additional information on lymph node measurement is provided 
below (see "Id entification of Target and Non -Target Lesions" and "Calculation of Sum of 
Diameters").

Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
138/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  DEFINITION OF NON -MEASURABLE LESIONS  
Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (longest diameter  10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with short axis  10 mm b ut  15 mm) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly non -measurable include 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast 
disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, peritoneal spread , and abdominal 
mass/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not measurable 
by reproducible imaging techniques.  
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIO NS REGARDING LESION MEASURABILITY  
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated wit h local therapy require 
particular comment, as outlined below.  
Bone Lesions:  
 Technetium -99m bone scans, sodium fluoride positron emission tomography scans, 
and plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques for measuring bone 
lesions.  However,  these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesions.  
 Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions with identifiable soft tissue 
components that can be evaluated by cross -sectional imaging techniques such as 
CT or MRI  can be considered measurable lesions if the soft tissue component 
meets  the definition of measurability described above.  
 Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.  
 
Cystic Lesions:  
 Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts sho uld not be 
considered malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they 
are, by definition, simple cysts.  
 Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered 
measurable lesions if they meet the definition of measurabi lity described above.  
However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions.  
 
Appendix 3:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors , Version 1.1  (RECIST  v1.1)   
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
139/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  Lesions with Prior Local Treatment:  
 Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area or in an area subjected to 
other loco -regional therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there has 
been demonstrated progression in the lesion.   
 
METHODS FOR ASSESSIN G LESIONS  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically 
assessed.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the 
treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during the study.  
Imaging -based evaluation should always be the preferred option.  
CLINICAL LESIONS  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and 
 10 mm in diameter as asse ssed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  For the case of 
skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size 
of the lesion, is suggested.  
CHEST X -RAY  
Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progressi on is an important 
endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying new lesions.  
However, lesions on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  
CT AND MRI SCANS  
CT is th e best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected 
for response assessment.  In this guideline, the definition of measurability of lesions on 
CT scan is based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is  5 mm.  When CT scans 
have slice thickness of  5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be 
twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable.  
If prior to enrollment it is known that a patient is unable to undergo CT scans with 
intravenous (IV) contrast because of  allergy or renal insufficiency, the decision as to 
whether a non -contrast CT or MRI (without IV contrast) will be used to evaluate the 
patient at baseline and during the study should be guided by the tumor type under 
investigation and the anatomic locatio n of the disease.  For patients who develop 
contraindications to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the decision as to 
whether non -contrast CT or MRI (enhanced or non -enhanced) will be performed should 
also be based on the tumor type and the anat omic location of the disease, and should 
Appendix 3:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors , Version 1.1  (RECIST  v1.1)   
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
140/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  be optimized to allow for comparison with the prior studies if possible.  Each case should 
be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of these other approaches is 
possible and, if not, the patien t should be considered not evaluable from that point 
forward .  Care must be taken in measurement of target lesions and interpretation of 
non-target  disease or new lesions on a different modality, since the same lesion may 
appear to have a different size us ing a new modality.  
ENDOSCOPY, LAPAROSCO PY, ULTRASOUND, TUMO R MARKERS, 
CYTOLOGY, HISTOLOGY  
Endoscopy, laparoscopy, ultrasound, tumor markers, cytology, and histology cannot be 
used  for objective tumor evaluation.  
ASSESSMENT OF TUMOR BURDEN  
To assess object ive response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the 
overall tumor burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent 
measurements.  
IDENTIFICATION OF TA RGET AND NON -TARGET LESIONS  
When more than one measurable lesion is present a t baseline, all lesions up to a 
maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative 
of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and 
measured at baseline.  This means that, for instanc es in which patients have only one or 
two organ sites involved, a maximum of two lesions (one site) and four lesions (two 
sites), respectively, will be recorded.  Other lesions (albeit measurable) in those organs 
will be considered non -target lesions.   
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) and should be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement, in which 
circumstance the next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should be 
selected.  
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures that 
may be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor.  As noted above, pathological 
nodes that are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet 
the criterion of a short axis of  15 mm by CT scan.  Only the short axis of these nodes 
will contribute to the baseline sum.  The short axis of the node is the diameter normally 
used by radiologists to judge if a node is involved by solid tumor.  Lymph node size is 
normally reported as two  dimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT, 
this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI, the plane of acquisition may be axial, 
Appendix 3:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors , Version 1.1  (RECIST  v1.1)   
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
141/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  sagittal, or coronal).  The smaller of these measures is the short axis.  For example, an 
abdominal node  that is reported as being 20  mm  30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm 
and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 20 mm should be 
recorded as the node measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis 
 10 mm but  15 mm) should be considered non -target lesions.  Nodes that have a 
short axis of  10 mm are considered non -pathological and should not be recorded or 
followed.  
All lesions (or sites of disease) not selected as target lesions (measurable or 
non-measurable ), including pathological lymph nodes, should be identified as non -target 
lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required.  It is 
possible to record multiple non-target  lesions involving the same organ as a single item 
on the Case R eport Form (CRF) (e.g., "multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes" or 
"multiple liver metastases").  
CALCULATION OF SUM O F DIAMETERS  
A sum of the diameters (longest diameter for non lymph node lesions, short axis for 
lymph node lesions) will be calculated for all target lesions at baseline and at each 
subsequent tumor assessment as a measure of tumor burden.  
Measuring Lymph Nodes  
Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis 
measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomic al plane as the baseline 
examination), even if the node regresses to  10 mm during the study.  Thus, when 
lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the sum of diameters may not be zero even 
if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph nod e is defined as having a 
short axis of  10 mm.  
Measuring Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure  
During the study, all target lesions (lymph node and non lymph node) recorded at 
baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent 
evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm).  However, sometimes lesions or lymph 
nodes that are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that 
the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measurement and may 
report them as being too small to measure.  When this occurs, it is important that a value 
be recorded on the CRF, as follows:  
 If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the 
measurement should be recorded as 0 mm.  
Appendix 3:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors , Version 1.1  (RECIST  v1.1)   
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
142/Protocol GO41892, Version 5   If the lesio n is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a 
default value of 5 mm should be assigned and "too small to measure" should be 
ticked.  (Note:  It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they 
usually have  a definable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by fat 
such as in the retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present 
and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be 
assigned in this circumsta nce as well and "too small to measure" should also be 
ticked).  
 
To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measurement, that 
should be recorded, even if it is  5 mm, and in that case "too small to measure" should 
not be ticked.  
Measuring Lesions That Split or Coalesce on Treatment  
When non lymph node lesions fragment, the longest diameters of the fragmented 
portions should be added together to calculate the sum of diameters.  Similarly, as 
lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining 
maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly 
coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in 
this instance should be the maximum lo ngest diameter for the coalesced lesion.  
EVALUATION OF NON -TARGET LESIONS  
Measurements are not required for non -target lesions, except that malignant lymph node 
non-target lesions should be monitored for reduction to  10 mm in short axis.  
Non-target lesi ons should be noted at baseline and should be identified as "present" or 
"absent" and (in rare cases) may be noted as "indicative of progression" at subsequent 
evaluations.  In addition, if a lymph node lesion shrinks to a non -malignant size (short 
axis  10 mm), this should be captured on the CRF as part of the assessment of non -
target lesions.  
RESPONSE CRITERIA  
CRITERIA FOR TARGET LESIONS  
Definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor response for target lesions 
are provided below:  
 Complete  response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions  
Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to  10 mm.  
 Partial response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR  
Appendix 3:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors , Version 1.1  (RECIST  v1.1)   
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
143/Protocol GO41892, Version 5   Progressive disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters at prior timepoints  
(including baseline)  
In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum of diameters must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of  5 mm.  
 Stable disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for CR or PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD  
 
CRITERIA FOR NON -TARGET LESIONS  
Definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for the group of non -
target lesions are provided below.  While some non -target lesions may actually be 
measurable, they need not be measured and instead should be assessed only 
qualitatively at the timepoints specified in the schedule of activities.  
 CR:  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of 
tumor marker level  
All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (  10 mm short axis).  
 Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesions and/or 
(if applicable) maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
 PD:  Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions  
 
SPECIAL NOTES ON ASS ESSMENT OF PROGRESSI ON OF NON -TARGET 
LESIONS  
Patients with Measurable and Non -Measurable Disease  
For patients with both measurable and non -measurable disease to achieve unequivocal 
progression on the basis of the non -target lesions, there must be an overall level of 
substantial worsening in no n-target lesions in a magnitude that, even in the presence of 
SD or PR in target lesions, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy.  A modest increase in the size of one or more non -target 
lesions is usually n ot sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The 
designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non -target lesions in 
the face of SD or PR in target lesions will therefore be extremely rare.  
NEW LESIONS  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for 
the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion 
should be une quivocal, that is, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, 
change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor 
(for example, some "new" bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexisting 
lesions).  This is particularly important when the patient's baseline lesions show PR or 
Appendix 3:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors , Version 1.1  (RECIST  v1.1)   
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
144/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  CR.  For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a 
"new" cystic lesion, which it is not.  
A lesion identified during the study in an anatomical  location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.  
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow -up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly  new disease.  If repeat scans confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion, progression should be declared using the date of the 
initial scan.  
CRITERIA FOR OVERALL  RESPONSE AT A SINGL E TIMEPOINT  
Table  1 provides a summary of the overall response status calculation at each response 
assessment timepoint for patients who have measurable disease at baseline.  
Table  1 Criteria for Overall  Response at a Single Timepoint:  Patients 
with Target Lesions (with or without Non -Target Lesions)  
Target Lesions  Non-Target Lesions  New Lesions  Overall Response  
CR CR No CR 
CR Non-CR/non -PD No PR 
CR Not all evaluated  No PR 
PR Non-PD or not all 
evaluated  No PR 
SD Non-PD or not all 
evaluated  No SD 
Not all evaluated  Non-PD No NE 
PD Any Yes or no  PD 
Any PD Yes or no  PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
CR   complete response; NE   not evaluable; PD   progressive disease; PR   partial 
response; SD   stable disease.  
 
MISSING ASSESSMENTS AND NOT -EVALUABLE DE SIGNATION  
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the patient is not 
evaluable at that timepoint.  If measurements are made on only a subset of target 
lesions at a timepoint, usually the case is also considered not evaluable at that 
timepoint, unless a convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the 
individual missing lesions would not change the assigned timepoint response.  This 
would be most likely to happen in the case of PD.  For example, if a patient had a 
Appendix 3:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors , Version 1.1  (RECIST  v1.1)   
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
145/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  baseline sum  of 50 mm with three measured lesions and during the study only two 
lesions were assessed, but those gave a sum of 80 mm, the patient will have achieved 
PD status, regardless of the contribution of the missing lesion.  
SPECIAL NOTES ON RES PONSE ASSESSMENT  
Patients with a global deterioration in health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
"symptomatic deterioration."  Every effort should be made to document objectiv e 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a 
descriptor of an objective response; it is a reason for stopping study therapy.  The 
objective response status of such patients is to be determined by evaluation of target 
and non -target lesions as shown in  Table  1. 
For equivocal findings of progression (e.g., very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic 
changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled 
assessment.   If at the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of 
progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected.

Risks Associated with Atezolizumab and Guidelines for 
Management of Adverse Events Associated with Atezolizumab
 
Toxicities associated or possibly associated with atezolizumab treatment should be 
managed according to standard medical practice.  Additional tests, such as autoimmune 
serology or biopsies, should be used to evaluate for a possible immunogenic etiology.  
Although most immune -mediated  adverse events observed with immunomodulatory 
agents have been mild and self -limiting, such events should be recognized early and 
treated promptly to avoid potential major complications.  Discontinuation of atezolizumab 
may not have an immediate therapeut ic effect, and in severe cases, immune -mediated
 toxicities may require acute management with topical corticosteroids, systemic 
corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressive agents.  
The following are general recommendations for management of any other advers e events 
that may occur and are not specifically listed in the following subsections.  
 Patients and family caregivers should receive timely and up -to-date information 
about immunotherapies, their mechanism of action, and the clinical profile of 
possible im mune -related adverse events prior to initiating therapy and throughout 
treatment and survival follow -up.  There should be a high level of suspicion that 
new symptoms are treatment related.  
 In general, atezolizumab therapy should be continued with close mon itoring for 
Grade 1 toxicities, with the exception of some neurologic toxicities.  
 Consider holding atezolizumab for most Grade 2 toxicities and resume when 
symptoms and/or laboratory values resolve to Grade 1 or better.  Corticosteroids 
(initial dose of 0. 51 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent) may be administered.
 
 For Grade 2 recurrent or persistent (lasting for more than 5 days) events, treat as a 
Grade 3 event.   
 Hold atezolizumab for Grade 3 toxicities and initiate treatment with high -dose 
corticoste roids (12 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent).  Corticosteroids should 
be tapered over 1 month to 10 mg/day oral prednisone or equivalent, before 
atezolizumab can be resumed.  If symptoms do not improve within 48 to 72 hours 
of high -dose corticosteroid us e, other immunosuppressants may be offered for some 
toxicities.  
 In general, Grade 4 toxicities warrant permanent discontinuation of atezolizumab 
treatment, with the exception of endocrinopathies that are controlled by 
hormone -replacement therapy.  
 The inves tigator should consider the benefit risk balance  for a given patient prior 
to further administration of atezolizumab.  Resumption of atezolizumab may be 
considered in patients who are deriving benefit and have  fully recovered from the

should be based on  the investigator’s assessment of the benefits and risks and 
documented by the investigator. The Medical Monitor is available to advise as 
needed .

MANAGEMENT GUIDELINE S 
PULMONARY EVENTS  
Pulmonary events may present as new or worsening cough, chest pain, fever, dyspnea,  
fatigue, hypoxia, pneumonitis, and pul monary infiltrates.  Patients will be assessed for 
pulmonary signs and symptoms throughout the study and will have computed 
tomography (CT) scans of the chest performed at every tumor assessment.   
All pulmonary events should be thoroughly evaluated for other commonly reported 
etiologies , such as pneumonia or other infection, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, 
pulmonary embolism, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or pulmonary 
hypertension.  COVID -19 evaluation should be performed per institu tional guidelines 
where relevant.  Management guidelines for pulmonary events are provided in  Table  1.

ENDOCRINE EVENTS  
Management guidelines for endocrine events are provided in  Table  4. 
Patients with unexplained symptoms such as headache, fatigue, myalgia s, impotence, 
constipation, or mental status changes should be investigated for the presence of 
thyroid, pituitary, or adrenal endocrinopathies.  The patient should be referred to an 
endocrinologist if an endocrinopathy is suspected.  Thyroid -stimulating h ormone (TSH) 
and free triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels should be measured to determine whether 
thyroid abnormalities are present.  Pituitary hormone levels and function tests (e.g., 
TSH, growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle -stimulating hormon e, testosterone, 
prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] levels, and ACTH stimulation test) and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (with detailed pituitary sections) may 
help to differentiate primary pituitary insufficiency from primary ad renal insufficiency.

160/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  IMMUNE -MEDIATED CARD IAC EVENTS  
Management guidelines for cardiac events are provided in Table  6. 
IMMUNE -MEDIATED MYOC ARDITIS  
Immune- mediated myocarditis should be suspected in any patient presenting with signs 
or symptoms suggestive of myocarditis, including, but not limited to, laboratory (e.g., B -
type natriuretic peptide) or cardiac imaging abnormalities, dyspnea, chest pain, 
palpitations, fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, or syncope.  Myocarditis may also be 
a clinical manifestation of myositis or associated with pericarditis (see section on 
pericardial disorders below) and should be managed accordingly .  Immune -mediated 
myocarditis needs to be distinguished from myocarditis resulting from infection 
(commonly viral, e.g., in a patient who reports a recent history of gastrointestinal illness), ischemic events, underlying arrhythmias, exacerbation of preexisting cardiac conditions, or progression of malignancy.   
All patients with possible myocarditis should be urgently evaluated by performing cardiac enzyme assessment, an ECG, a chest X- ray, an echocardiogram, and a cardiac MRI as 
appropriate per institutional guidelines.  A  cardiologist should be consulted.  An 
endomyocardial biopsy may be considered to enable a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment, if clinically indicated.  
Patients with signs and symptoms of myocarditis, in the absence of an identified alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Table  6. 
IMMUNE -MEDIATED PERI CARDIAL DISORDERS  
Immune -mediated pericarditis should be suspected in any patient presenting with chest 
pain and may be associated with immune -mediated myocarditis (see section on 
myocarditis above).  
Immune -mediated pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade should be suspected in 
any patient presenting with chest pain associated with dyspnea or hemodynamic instability.  
Patients should be evaluated for other causes of pericardial disorders such as infection (commonly viral), cancer related (metastatic disease or chest radiotherapy), cardiac injury related (post myocardial  infarction or iatrogenic), and autoimmune disorders, 
and should be managed accordingly.  
All patients with suspected pericardial disorders should be urgently evaluated by performing an ECG, chest X -ray, transthoracic echocardiogram, and cardiac MRI as 
appr opriate per institutional guidelines.  A cardiologist should be consulted.

161/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  Pericardiocentesis should be considered for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, if 
clinically indicated.  
Patients with signs and symptoms of pericarditis, pericardial effusion, or cardiac 
tamponade, in the absence of an identified alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Table  6.  Withhold treatment with atezolizumab for 
Grade  1 pericarditis and conduct a detailed cardiac evaluation to determine the etiology 
and manage accordingly.

methylprednisolone and convert to 1− 2 mg/kg/day oral prednisone or 
equivalent upon improvement.  
• If event does not improve within 48 hours after initiating corticosteroids, consider adding an immunosuppressive agent.  
• If event resolves to Grade 1 or better, taper corticosteroids over
 ≥ 1 month.  
ECMO  = extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; VAD  = ventricular assist device . 
 
INFUSION -RELATED REA CTIONS  AND CYTOKINE -RELEAS E SYNDROME  
No premedication is indicated for the administration of Cycle 1 of atezolizumab.  
However, patients who experience an infusion- related reaction (IRR) or cytokine -release 
syndrome (CRS) with of atezolizumab may receive premedication with antipyretic 
medications , and/or analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen) for subsequent infusions.  
Metamizole (dipyrone) is prohibited in treating atezolizumab- associated IRRs because of 
its potential for causing agranulocytosis.  
IRRs are known to occur with the administration of monoclonal antibodies and have been reported with atezolizumab.  These reactions, which are thought to be due to release of cytokines and/or other chemical mediators, occur within 24 hours of atezolizumab administration and are generally mild to moderate in severity.  
CRS is defined as a supraphysiologic response following administration of any immune therapy that results in activation or engagement of endogenous or infused T cells and/or other immune effector cells.  Symptoms can be progressive, always include fever at the 
Appendix 6: Risks Associated with Atezolizumab  and Guidelines for Management  
of Adverse Events Associated with Atezolizumab    
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 
162/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  onset, and may include hypotension, capillary leak (hypoxia), and end -organ dysfunction 
(Lee et al. 2019).  CRS has been well documented with chimeric antigen receptor T -cell 
therapies and bispecific T -cell engager antibody therapies but has also been reported 
with immunotherapies that target PD -1 or PD -L1 (Rotz et al. 2017; Adashek and 
Feldman 2019), including atezolizumab.  
There may be significant overlap in signs and symptoms of IRRs and CRS, and in 
recognition of the challenges in clinically distinguishing between the two, consolidated guidelines for  the medical management of IRRs during Cycle 1 are provided in Table 7 .  
For subsequent cycles, IRRs should be managed according to institutional guidelines.  
Severe SARS- CoV-2 infection appears to be associated with a CRS involving the 
inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) -6, IL-10, IL -2, and IFN -
γ (Merad and Martin 2020).  
If a patient develops suspected CRS during the study, a differential diagnosis should include SARS- CoV-2 infection which should be confirmed or refuted through 
assessment of exposure history, appropriate laboratory testing, and clinical or radiologic evaluations per investigator’s  judgment.  If a diagnosis of SARS- CoV-2 infection is 
confirmed, the disease should be managed as per local or institutional guidelines.

The majority of cases of rash reported with the use of atezolizumab were mild in severity 
and self -limited, with or without pruritus.   Although uncommon , cases of severe 
cutaneous adverse reactions  such as Stevens -Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal 
necrolysis have been reported with atezolizumab.   A dermatologist should evaluate 
persistent and/or severe rash or pruritus.  A biopsy should be considered unless 
contraindica ted.  Management guidelines for dermatologic events are provided in 
Table  9.

IMMUNE -MEDIATED MENI NGOENCEPHALITIS  
Immune -mediated meningoencephalitis should be suspected in any patient presenting 
with signs or symptoms suggestive of meningitis or encephalitis, including, but not 
limited to, headache, neck pain, confusion, seizure, motor or sensory dysfunction, and 
altered or depressed level of consciousness.  Encephalopathy from metabolic or 
electrolyte imbalances needs to be distinguished from potential meningoencephalitis 
resulting from infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal) or progression of malignancy, or 
secondar y to a paraneoplastic process.   
All patients being considered for meningoencephalitis should be urgently evaluated with 
a CT scan and/or MRI scan of the brain to evaluate for metastasis, inflammation, or 
edema.  If deemed safe by the treating physician, a  lumbar puncture should be 
performed , and a neurologist should be consulted.  
Patients with signs and symptoms of meningoencephalitis, in the absence of an 
identified alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in  Table  12.

corticosteroids, consider adding an immunosuppressive agent.  
 If event resolves to Grade 1 or better , taper corticosteroids over 
 1 month.  
 
RENAL EVENTS  
Eligible patients must hav e adequate renal function.  R enal function, including serum 
creatinine, should be monitored throughout study treatment.  Patients with abnormal 
renal function should be evaluated and treated for other more  common etiologies 
(including prerenal and postrenal causes, and concomitant medications such as 
non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs).  Refer the patient to a renal specialist if clinically 
indicated.  A renal biopsy may be required to enable a definitiv e diagnosis and 
appropriate treatment.  
Patients with signs and symptoms of nephritis, in the absence of an identified alternate 
etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in  Table  13.

IMMUNE -MEDIATED MYOS ITIS 
Myositis or inflammatory myopathies are a group of disorders sharing the common 
feature of inflammatory muscle injury; dermatomyositis and polymyositis are among the 
most common disorders.  Initial diagnosis is based on clinical (muscle weakness, muscle 
pain, skin rash in dermatomyositis), biochemical (serum creatine kinase increase), and 
imaging (electromyography/MRI) features, and is confirmed with a muscle biopsy.  
Patients with possible myositis should be referred to a rheumatologist or neurologist.  
Patients with possible myositis should be monitored for signs of myocarditis.  
Patients with signs and symptoms of myositis, in the absence of an identified alternate 
etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in  Table  14.

of Adverse Events Associated with Cabozantinib    
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
181/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  Adverse events may occur within the first few weeks in the course of treatment with 
cabozantinib, as cabozantinib is expected to reach steady state exposure at 
approximately 2 weeks following first dose.  Events that generally have an early onset 
include hypocalce mia, hypokalemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, PPE, abdominal 
pain, mucosal inflammation, constipation, diarrhea, and vomiting.  Adverse events 
should be managed with supportive care at the earliest signs of toxicity.  Dose 
reductions and treatment inte rruptions should be considered.  Dose reductions are 
recommended for events that, if persistent, could become serious or intolerable (see 
Section  5.1.4.1 ). 
Cabozantinib should be discontinued for the following adverse events:  visceral 
perforation or fistula formation, severe hemorrhage, serious arterial thromboembolic 
events, nephrotic syndrome, hypertension with life -threatening consequences , persistent 
uncontrolled hypertension despite optimal medical management, serious and life -
threatening rhabdomyolysis, and RPLS.  
GASTROINTESTINAL DIS ORDERS  
Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation, GI fistula, and intra -abdominal and pelvic abscess :  
After start ing treatment with cabozantinib, patients should be monitored for early signs of 
GI perforation such as abdominal pain, nausea, emesis, constipation, and fever 
especially if known risk factors for developing GI perforation or fistula (Turnage and 
Badgwell 2016) are present.  Discontinue cabozantinib and initiate appropriate 
management in patients who have been diagnosed with GI perforation or fistula.  
Diarrhea:   Patients should be instructed to notify their physician immediately at the first 
signs of poorly formed or loose stool or an increased frequency of bowel movements.  
Guidelines for the evaluation and management of diarrhea are shown in Table  1.  
Administration of antidiarrheal/anti -motility agents is recommended at the first sign of 
diarrhea as initial management.  Some patients may requir e concomitant treatment with 
more than one antidiarrheal agent.  When therapy with antidiarrheal agents does not 
control the diarrhea to tolerable levels, cabozantinib should be temporarily interrupted or 
dose reduced.  When the diarrhea is controlled, ret reatment with cabozantinib may be 
acceptable per Investigator decision.  In addition, general supportive measures should 
be implemented such as continuous oral isotonic hydration, correction of fluid and 
electrolyte abnormalities, small frequent meals, and  stopping lactose -containing 
products, high -fat meals, and alcohol.  
Recurrent or prolonged diarrhea can be associated with anal or perianal skin erosions 
which increase the risk for anal abscesses, fistulas, or proctitis.  Good personal hygiene 
should be e mphasized.  Regular examinations of the perianal region should be

of Adverse Events Associated with Cabozantinib    
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
182/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  performed whenever diarrhea has occurred during treatment with cabozantinib. 
Infections of the perianal region should be treated per local guidelines.  
Table  1 Management of Diarrhea Associated with Cabozantinib  
Status  Management  
Tolerable Grade 1 2 
(duration  48 h)  Continue with study treatment and consider dose reduction.  
 Initiate treatment with an antidiarrheal agent (e.g., loperamide 
4 mg followed by 2 mg a fter each episode of diarrhea 
[maximum: 16  mg loperamide per day]).  
 Dietary modifications (e.g., small lactose -free meals, bananas 
and rice).  
 Intake of isotonic fluids (1 1.5 L/day).  
 Re-assess after 24 hours:  
− Diarrhea resolving to baseline bowel habits: gr adually add 
solid foods and discontinue or decrease antidiarrheal 
treatment after 12  h diarrhea -free interval.  
− Diarrhea not resolving: Continue/resume antidiarrheal 
treatment.  
Intolerable Grade 2,  
Grade 2  48 h,  
or  Grade 3   Interrupt study treatment.  
 Ask patient to attend clinic.  
 Rule out infection (e.g., stool sample for culture)  
− Administer antibiotics as needed (e.g., if fever or Grade 3 4 
neutropenia persists >  24 h) 
 Administer fluids (1 1.5 L/day orally or. IV, as appropriate) for 
hydration or to correct electrolyte abnormalities.  
 For Grade 3 -4 or complicated lower -grade diarrhea consider 
hospitalization and IV hydration.  
 Re-assess after 24 h  
− Diarrhea resolving to baseline bowel habits or Grade ≤  1: 
consider restarting study treatment at reduced do se. 
− Diarrhea not resolving:  Start and or continue antidiarrheal 
treatment (e.g., loperamide 4 mg followed by 2 mg after 
each episode of diarrhea [maximum: 16 mg loperamide per 
day]). Consider starting second line antidiarrheal or referral 
to gastroenterol ogist.  
 
Nausea and vomiting:   Antiemetic agents are recommended as clinically appropriate for 
treatment or prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting, along with supportive care.  
Dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities may be associated with vomiting and 
monitoring for and correction of f luid and electrolyte disturbances should be 
implemented.  Antiemetic medications should be assessed for potential drug interactions 
(see Section  4.4 for further details).

of Adverse Events Associated with Cabozantinib    
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
183/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  NON -GASTROINTESTINAL  FISTULA  
Complications from radiation therapy especially of the thoracic cavity including 
mediastinum have been identified as a possible predisposing risk factor for non -GI fistula 
formation in patients undergoing tr eatment with VEGF pathway inhibitors.  
Discontinue cabozantinib and initiate appropriate management in patients who have 
been diagnosed with a non -GI fistula.  
HEMORRHAGE  
Hemorrhagic events, including serious and sometimes fatal events,  have been reported 
with cabozantinib .  Patients should be monitored for bleeding events with serial complete 
blood counts and physical examination while on study.  The risk of hemorrhage in 
cabozantinib -treated patients with brain metastases has not been thoroughly analyzed.   
Patients enrolled with treated and stable brain metastases should be monitored with a 
high index of suspicion if symptoms that could be due to a CNS hemorrhage occur.  
Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients with serious and life -threatening 
bleed ing events or recent hemoptysis (≥  2.5 mL of red blood).  
THROMBOEMBOLIC EVENT S  
Thromboembolic events are frequent in cancer patients due to procoagulant changes 
induced by the malignancy or anti -cancer therapy.  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and 
pulmonary em bolism  (PE) have been observed in clinical studies with cabozantinib, 
including fatal events .  Patients who develop a PE and/or DVT should have study 
treatment interrupted until therapeutic anticoagulation is established .  Treatment with 
cabozantinib  may b e resumed in patients with PE or DVT if it is determined that the 
event is uncomplicated and that the patient is deriving clinical benefit from cabozantinib 
treatment and that anticoagulation does not place them at a significant risk that 
outweighs the ben efit of resuming treatment  per the discretion of the Investigator and 
according to individual protocols .  Low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or 
anticoagulation with direct factor Xa oral inhibitors rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or apixaban is 
allowed for the tre atment of thromboembolic events if clinically indicated and the benefit 
outweighs the risk per the investigator’s discretion .  Anticoagulation with warfarin or 
other coumarin -related agents, or the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, or the direct 
factor  Xa inhibitor betrixaban, or antiplatelet agents, or chronic use of aspirin above low 
dose levels for cardioprotection per local applicable guidelines is not allowed.  Refer to 
Sections  4.1.2  and 4.4.1  for detailed information regarding the use of anti -coagulants.  
Arterial thrombotic events (e.g.,  TIA, myocardial infarction) have been observed in 
studies with cabozantinib .  Further treatment  with cabozantinib should be discontinued in 
Appendix 7: Risks Associated with Cabozantinib and Guidelines for Management  
of Adverse Events Associated with Cabozantinib    
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 
184/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  patients who develop an acute myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, or any other 
clinically significant arterial thromboembolic complication. 
The available cabozantinib data from clinical studies and postm arketing experience 
showed that arterial aneurysms and dissections may occur rarely during cabozantinib 
treatment.  These events appear to primarily occur in the presence of hypertension 
(which is a known risk factor for this condition); however, in some e vents the presence 
of hypertension was not documented.   Discontinuation of treatment with cabozantinib 
should be considered in subjects who develop aortic aneurysm and dissections. 
HYPERTENSION  
Table 2  provides treatment guidelines for hypertension deemed related to cabozantinib.  
Blood pressure should be monitored in a constant position visit to visit, either sitting or supine in a relaxed setting.  Decisions to reduce or interrupt the dose of study tr eatment 
must be based on BP readings taken by a medical professional and must be confirmed with a second measurement at least 5 minutes following the first measurement.  
Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients with hypertension with life -threatenin g 
consequences or when urgent intervention is indicated, and appropriate medical management should be initiated .

Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
186/Protocol GO41892 , Version 5  STOMATITIS AND MUCOS ITIS 
Preventive measures may include a comprehensive oral examination to identify and 
treat any potential risk for complications before study treatment is initiated.  Appropriate 
correction of local factors should be instituted as indicated, such as modification of 
ill-fitting dentures and appr opriate care of gingivitis.  During treatment with cabozantinib, 
good oral hygiene and standard local treatments such as non -traumatic and 
non-irritating cleansing, and oral rinses (e.g.,  with a weak solution of salt and baking 
soda) should be maintained. Lips should be kept moisturized with lip balm.  The use of 
lipstick, lip -gloss, and Vaseline should be avoided.  
Local treatment should be instituted at the earliest onset of symptoms.  Obtain 
bacterial/viral culture if oral infection is suspected and treat  infection as clinically 
indicated.  
SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOU S TISSUE DISORDERS  
Wound healing and surgery :  Cabozantinib has the potential to cause wound healing 
complications and wound dehiscence, which may even occur long after a wound has 
been considered he aled.  Therefore, surgical and traumatic wounds must not only be 
completely healed prior to starting cabozantinib treatment but must also be monitored for 
wound dehiscence, wound infection and other signs of impaired wound healing while the 
patient is bein g treated with cabozantinib.  If dehiscence occurs, cabozantinib treatment 
should not be restarted until complete healing has taken place.  
Treatment with cabozantinib should be stopped at least 28 days prior to scheduled 
surgery.  The decision to resume t reatment with cabozantinib after surgery should be 
based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing.  
Palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia  (PPE; also known as hand -foot syndrome):  S kin 
rash (including blister, erythematous rash, macular rash, skin exfoli ation, dermatitis 
acneiform, and papular rash), pruritus, dry skin, erythema, pigmentary changes, and 
alopecia have been reported with cabozantinib.  All patients on study should be advised 
on prophylactic measures including the use of emollients, removal of calluses, 
avoidance of exposure of hands and feet to hot water leading to vasodilatation, 
protection of pressure -sensitive areas of hands and feet, and use of cotton gloves and 
socks to prevent injury and keep the palms and soles dry.  
Early manifestatio ns include tingling, numbness, mild hyperkeratosis, and symmetrical 
red and swollen areas on the palms and soles.  The lateral sides of the fingers or 
periungual zones may also be affected. Adequate interventions are required to prevent 
worsening of skin s ymptoms such as blisters, desquamations, ulcerations, or necrosis of 
affected areas.  Analgesics may be required for pain control.

Cabozantinib  
CTCAE v5 Grade  Action To Be Taken  
Grade 1  Cabozantinib treatment may be continued at the current dose if 
PPE is clinically insignificant and tolerable.  Otherwise, cabozantinib 
should be reduced to the next lower dose level. a  Start urea 20% 
cream twice daily AND clobetasol 0.05% cream once daily.  
Reassess at least weekly; if PPE worsens at any time or does not 
improve after 2 weeks, proceed to the intervention guidelines for 
Grade  2. 
Grade 2  Cabozantinib treatment may be c ontinued if PPE is tolerated.  
Cabozantinib should be dose reduced or interrupted if PPE is 
intolerable.  Continue urea 20% cream twice daily AND high 
potency steroid cream (e.g., clobetasol 0.05%) once daily and add 
analgesics (e.g.,  NSAIDs/gamma -aminobut yric acid agonists) for 
pain control if needed.  Reassess at least weekly; if PPE worsens or 
affects self -care, proceed to the intervention guidelines for Grade  3. 
Grade 3  Interrupt cabozantinib treatment until severity decreases to Grade 1 
or 0.  Continu e treatment of skin reaction with high potency steroid 
cream (e.g., clobetasol 0.05%) twice daily AND analgesics.  
Resume cabozantinib at a reduced dose if PPE recovers to Grade 
≤ 1.  Discontinue the patient from study treatment if PPE does not

Angioedema should be managed according to standard practice. The patient  should be 
observed until symptoms resolve, with particular attention to maintaining an open 
airway . 
OSTEONECROSIS  
Osteonecrosis has been reported in patients treated with cabozantinib.  Additional risk factors include use of bisphosphonates and denosumab, chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic drugs, use of corticosteroids, local radiotherapy, and dental or orofacial 
surgery procedures.  
Osteonec rosis of the jaw (ONJ) can manifest as jaw pain, osteomyelitis, osteitis, bone 
erosion, tooth or periodontal infection, toothache, gingival ulceration, or gingival erosion.  Persistent pain or slow healing of the mouth or jaw after dental surgery may also be 
manifestations of osteonecrosis.  
Advise patients regarding oral hygiene practice and to quickly report symptoms to the Investigator.  Caution should be used in patients receiving bisphosphonates.  
Invasive dental procedures should be avoided.  In cases where dental procedures are unavoidable, treatment with cabozantinib should be interrupted for at least 4 weeks prior to the procedure and resumed after complete wound healing has occurred.  Bone healing may often require a protracted time.  
If ONJ occurs, cabozantinib treatment should be held and should not be restarted 
until the condition has sufficiently healed and the Sponsor has approved the re-initiation of therapy.
 
PROTEINURIA  
Proteinuria has been reported with cabozantinib.  Proteinuria should be monitored by 
measuring UPCR.  Table  4 provides treatment guidelines for proteinuria deemed related 
to cabozantinib.  
Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria >
 3.5 grams per day in combination with low blood protein levels, high 
cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, and edema).

have been observed in clinical studies with cabozantinib .  The development of any new 
or progressive, unexplained neurological symptoms should be assessed for underlying 
causes.  
RPLS has been reported.  RPLS should be considered in any patient presenting with 
seizures, headache, visual disturbances, confusion or altered mental function.  
Cabozantinib treatment should be discontinued in patients with RPLS.  
HEPATOCELLULAR TOX ICITY  
Elevations of aminotransferases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin have been observed during 
treatment with cabozantinib.  It is recommended that patients with elevation of ALT, 
AST, and/or bilirubin have more frequent laboratory monitoring of these paramet ers.  If 
possible, hepatotoxic concomitant medications should be discontinued in patients who 
develop increased values of ALT, AST, or bilirubin and other causes (e.g., cancer -
related, or infection) should be evaluated.  
Management guidelines for hepatotoxi city related to cabozantinib treatment are provided

The following condition require s discontinuation of cabozantinib : 
 Drug -related ALT or AST  3  ULN in combination with total bilirubin  2  ULN 
without reasonable other e xplanation, consistent with drug -induced liver injury . 
 
INFECTIONS AND INFES TATIONS  
Infections are commonly observed in cancer patients.  Predisposing risk factors include 
decreased immune status (e.g.,  after myelosuppressive anti -cancer therapies, 
splenectomy), destructive growth of the und erlying malignancy including bone marrow 
infiltration with suppression of normal hematopoiesis, as well as the presence of IV 
devices.

therapy.  Cabozantinib  should be int errupted until adequate healing has taken place.  
BLOOD AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEM DISORDERS  
Hematological toxicities (i.e., neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) and associated 
complications have been observed after administration of cabozantinib and may be 
managed with dose interruptions and/or dose reductions.  Patients with hematologic 
toxicities may require additional or more frequent laboratory tests according to 
institutional guidelines.  
Dose reductions or dose interruptions for hematological toxicities are not mandated but 
can be applied as clinically indicated.  However, for patients with thrombocytopenia, 
dose modifications should be followed in accordance to Table  3 in Section 5.1.4.1 . 
Supportive care f or thrombocytopenia or anemia, such as transfusions, may be 
managed according to institutional guidelines.  The use of colony -stimulating growth 
factors should be considered.  Febrile neutropenia or evidence of infection associated 
with neutropenia must be  assessed immediately and treated appropriately and in a 
timely manner according to institutional guidelines.  
FATIGUE  
Common causes of fatigue, such as anemia, deconditioning, emotional distress 
(depression and/or anxiety), poor nutrition, dehydration, sleep disturbance, and 
hypothyroidism should be ruled out and treated according to standard of care.  
Pharmacological man agement should be considered after disease -specific morbidities 
have been excluded when not prohibited.  
WEIGHT LOSS  
Anorexia and weight loss should be managed according to local standard of care 
including nutritional support.  Pharmacologic therapy should  be considered for appetite 
enhancement when not prohibited by a particular protocol.  
CORRECTED QT PROLONG ATION  
The effect of orally administered cabozantinib 140 mg QD on QTc interval was evaluated 
in a placebo -controlled study in patients with medullary thyroid cancer.  A mean increase 
in QTcF of 10 15 ms was observed after 4 weeks after initiating cabozantinib treatment.  
A concentration -QTc relationship could not be definitively established. Changes in 
cardiac wave form morphology or new rhythms were no t observed.  No cabozantinib -
treated patients in this study had a QTcF  500 ms.  Review of the larger safety 
database (approximately 11,000 patients exposed to cabozantinib in clinical trials and

193/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  more than 98,000 patients in the postmarketing setting ) con firmed the absence of 
safety concerns associated with QT prolongation.  There were no events of torsades de 
pointes reported.  
Concomitant treatment with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors, which may 
increase cabozantinib plasma concentrations, sho uld be avoided.  
If at any time on study there is an increase in QTcF to an absolute value  500 ms or an 
increase of  60 ms above baseline per the site’s ECG read, two additional ECGs must 
be performed with intervals not less than 3 min apart within 30 m in after the initial  ECG.  
If the average QTcF from the three ECGs is  500 ms or the average increase is  60 ms 
above baseline, the following actions must be taken:  
 Interrupt cabozantinib treatment.  
 Immediately notify the Sponsor.  
 Hospitalize symptomatic patients (e .g., with palpitations, dizziness, syncope, 
orthostatic hypotension), or those with a significant ventricular arrhythmia on ECG 
for a thorough cardiology evaluation and management.  
 Consider cardiology consultation for asymptomatic patients for e valuation and 
management.  
 Check electrolytes, especially magnesium, potassium and calcium; correct 
abnormalities as clinically indicated.  
 Check concomitant medications for any medication that may have contributed to QT 
prolongation, and if possible, discon tinue these medications 
(http://www.qtdrugs.org ). 
 Repeat ECG triplicates hourly until the average QTcF is  500 ms and the average 
increase is ≤ 60 ms above baseline, or a consulting cardiologist or appropriate 
expert determines that the frequency of ECGs may revert to the schedule in the 
protocol.  
 
Patients with QTc prolongation and symptoms must be monitored closely until the QTc 
elevation and symptoms have resolved.   Cabozantinib treatment may be restarted but 
only at a reduced dose level if all of the f ollowing conditions are met:  
 Symptoms are determined to be unrelated to the QT interval prolongation  
 Cabozantinib treatment has been interrupted through a minimum of 1 week 
following the return of the QTcF to  500 ms or increase of  60 ms above baseline  
 QT prolongation can be unequivocally associated with an event other than 
cabozantinib administration and is treatable/has been resolved

194/Protocol GO41892, Version 5   Sponsor has reviewed all available information and has agreed to the 
continuation of study treatment  
 
Following re-initiation of study treatment, ECGs must be repeated weekly for 2  weeks, 
then every 2 weeks for 1 month, then accordi ng to the protocol -defined time points.  
Cabozantinib treatment must be permanently discontinued if either of the following 
applies:  
 Cardi ac evaluation confirms that symptoms are the consequence of QT interval 
prolongation  
 Recurrence of QTcF prolongation (confirmed by central ECG lab)  after re -initiation 
of study treatment at a reduced dose  
 
ENDOCRINE DISORDERS  
Thyroid  dysfunction, primarily hypothyroidism, has been observed with cabozantinib 
treatment. The underlying potential mechanism of thyroid dysfunction observed with 
cabozantinib treatment remains unclear. Routine monitoring of thyroid function and 
assessments fo r signs and symptoms associated with thyroid dysfunction is 
recommended before initiation and during treatment with cabozantinib .  Management 
of thyroid dysfunction (e.g.,  symptomatic hypothyroidism) should follow accepted clinical 
practice guidelines.  
MUS CULOSKELETAL  AND CONNECTIVE TISS UE DISORDERS  
Cabozantinib appears to represent minimal risk of adverse musculoskeletal effects based 
on nonclinical GLP -compliant toxicology studies.  The development of new or 
progressive, unexplained musculoskeletal symptoms such as pain or weakness should be 
assesse d for underlying causes.  
Rhabdomyolysis has been reported.  Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects 
with serious and life -threatening rhabdomyolysis and interrupted if less severe forms 
occur when there are no other clear causes.  Reinitiation of cabozantinib treatment 
must be discussed with and approved by the Sponsor.  Therapy of rhabdomyolysis 
should include supportive care and standard medical intervention.  
RESPIRATORY DISORDER S 
Dyspnea has been reported in clinical studies with cabozantinib.  Symptoms should be 
managed according to locally accepted clinical practice including an assessment for 
underlying causes.   Pulmonary embolism should be considered as possible causes for 
new onset dyspnea given the risk of thrombosis associated with inhibit ion of VEGF 
signaling.  Furthermore, fistula formation and pneumonia have been reported in subjects

of Adverse Events Associated with Cabozantinib    
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
195/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  treated with cabozantinib and should be considered as clinically indicated in subjects 
presenting with pulmonary symptoms.  
ELECTROLYTE DISORDER S 
Serum elect rolyte imbalance including hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, 
and hypophosphatemia  has been reported during treatment with cabozantinib. In some 
cases, there have been Grade 3 or 4 and/or serious.   
There are many causes for an electrolyte imbalance  including loss of body fluids (e.g., 
from prolonged vomiting or diarrhea), inadequate diet, kidney disease, and use of certain 
concomitant medications (e.g., diuretics).  Electrolyte imbalance may create a variety of 
symptoms (e.g., weakness, fatigue, con fusion, muscle spasm, constipation, and irregular 
heartbeat).   
Serum electrolyte levels should be monitored closely while receiving cabozantinib.  
Clinically relevant electrolyte disorders should be managed according to the dose 
modification guidelines (s ee Section 5.1.4.1 , Table  4) and may include oral or IV 
replacement.

Highly Effective Methods of Contraception  
In Inclusion Criteria  (see Section 4.1.1 ), sexually active fertile patient s and their partners 
must agree to use highly effective methods of contraception that alone or in combination 
result in a failure rate of less than 1% per year  when used consistently and correctly 
during the course of the study and until the end of relevant systemic exposure, defined 
as 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab and/or 4 months after the final dose of 
cabozantinib, whichever is later  , for wo men, and  4 months after the final dose of 
cabozantinib , or for 6  months after the final dose of docetaxel.  
The effect of cabozantinib on the pharmacokinetics  of contraceptive steroids has not 
been investigated.  Because oral contraceptives might possibly n ot be considered as 
“effective methods of contraception,” they should be used together with another method.  
Contraception guidance for female patient s of childbearing potential  
One of the highly effective methods of contraception listed below, in combinati on with 
one acceptable barrier method below, is required during study duration and until the end 
of relevant systemic exposure, defined as 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab 
and/or 4 months after the final dose of cabozantinib, whichever is late r.  Local laws and 
regulations may require use of alternative and/or additional contraception methods.  
Highly effective contraceptive methods that are user dependent:   These methods have a 
failure rate of < 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  Typical use failure 
rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly.   Use should be 
consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contracept ive methods for 
participants participating in clinical studies.  
 Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation  
− Oral, intravaginal, or transdermal  
 Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
− Oral or injectable  
 
Highly effective contraceptive methods that are user independent:  
 Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation  
 Hormonal methods of contraception incl uding oral contraceptive pills containing a 
combination of estrogen and progesterone, vaginal ring, injectables, implants, and 
intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
 Intrauterine device  
 Bilateral tubal occlusion  
 
Appendix 8:   Highly Effective Methods of Contraception    
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
197/Protocol GO41892 , Version 5   Vasectomized partner  
− A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that 
the partner is the sole male sexual partner of the female patient  of childbearing 
potential and the absence of sperm has been confirmed.   If not, an additional 
highly effectiv e method of contraception should be used  
 Sexual abstinence  
− Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk 
associated with the study drug.  The reliabili ty of sexual abstinence needs to be 
evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the participant.  
It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when 
complete abstinence is elected.  
Female patien ts of childbearing potential who choose complete abstinence 
must continue to have pregnancy tests per the protocol.  Acceptable 
alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in 
the event that any of these patient s chooses to forego complete 
abstinence.  
 
Acceptable barrier methods for use in combination with a highly effective method:  
 Male or female condom with or without spermicide  
 Diaphragm with spermicide  
 Cervical cap with spermicide  
 Vaginal Sponge with spermicide  
 
Unacceptable as a Sole Method of Contraception:  
 Male or female condom with or without spermicide. Male and female condoms 
cannot be used simultaneously  
 Diaphragm with spermicide  
 Cervical cap with spermicide  
 Vaginal Sponge with spermicide  
 Progestogen -only oral hormonal contraception of which inhibition of ovulation is not 
the primary mechanism of action  
 Periodic abstinence (e .g., calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods)  
 Withdrawal (e .g., coitus interruptus)  
 Spermicide only  
 Lactation amenorrhea method

198/Protocol GO41892, Version 5  Contracepti on guidance for male participants with partner(s) of 
childbearing potential  
Male patient s with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible if they agree to 
the following during the course of study treatment and until the end of relevant systemi c 
exposure, defined as 4 months after the final dose of cabozantinib , or for 6  months after 
the final dose of docetaxel.  
 Inform any and all partner(s) of their participation in a clinical drug study and the 
need to comply with contraception i nstructions as  directed by the i nvestigator.  
 Male patient s must refrain from donation sperm and are required to use a condom 
to prevent transmission of study treatment in semen during the treatment period and 
for 4 months after the final dose of cabozantinib .  
Note: Mal e patient s with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to 
remain abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during 
each episode of penile during the treatment period and for 4 months after the 
final dose of cabozantinib . 
 Docetax el may alter male fertility.  Male patients randomly assigned to receive 
docetaxel should seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment.

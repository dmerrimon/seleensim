 Study Design:  This is an open label, si ngle arm clinical trial to investigate the effect of SNF472 in uraemic 
calciphylaxis patients, on top of standard of care.  
Investigational 
Medicinal 
Product:  SNF472   
Presented as 10 mL or 5 mL of sterile liquid in transparent glass vial s, containing either 
300 mg or 450 mg of SNF472 , respectively . The SNF472 solutions used will be either 30 
mg/mL (Batch number P00142 -L001E ) or 90  mg/mL (Batch number  PD14081) and  will be 
diluted in a 100-mL saline bag and the contents of the whole bag will  be administered to the 
patient by slow infusion . SNF472 will be administered between 2.5  h and a 4 h period using 
the dialysis system during the dialysis session.  
Number of 
Patients:  15 evaluable CUA patients  who complete the 12 -week treatment period.  
A total of 15 evaluable subjects was determined necessary to show with 80% power that 
the percentage of subjects for which the primary ulcer is totally or partially healed after 12 
weeks of treatment  is greater than 25%. For these calculations, it was assumed that the 
percentage of totally or partially healed subjects for SNF472 will be 60%.  
Study 
Population:   
Main inclusion criteria:  
1. Patients with  either  newly diagnosed CUA OR recurrent CUA that has been dormant 
with no skin lesion involvement for at least 90 days from study start (new or recurrent 
diagnos is must be made  within 5 weeks of study start)  
2. Patients who signed the written informed consent to participate in this clini cal trial (prior 
to any clinical trial -related procedures being performed), after reading the Patient 
Information Sheet and Informed Consent Form (ICF), and who had the opportunity to 
discuss the clinical trial with the Investigator or designee  
3. Males or fe males aged ≥18   
4. Patients on maintenance haemodialysis  
5. Patients with a t least a  minimum level of pain on VAS scale  or on pain -killers stronger 
than NSAIDs  
6. Females of child -bearing potential should use a highly effective  contracepti ve measure  
throughout the study AND have a negative serum pregnancy test at entry. Male patients 
having sexual relationship in which pregnancy can occur should take adequate 
contraceptive precautions (wear a condom)  (see section 8.3.1.)  
 
Main exclusion criteria:  
1. Body weight above 150 kg  
2. BMI >35 and central(abdominal) ulcers   
3. History of bisphosphonate treatment within 12 months before entering into the 
study  
4. Severely ill patients without reasonable expectation of survival for > 6 months 
according to the treating physician

 5. Patients with scheduled parathyroidectomy during the run -in or study period  
6. Female patients who are either intending to get pregnant or are undergoing 
treatment to get pregnant , as well as breast -feeding females  
7. Participation in another clinical trial with an experimental drug within 90 days  prior 
the inclusion  
8. Any psychological, emotional problems, any disorders or resultant therapy that is 
likely to invalidate informed consent, or limit the ability of the patien t to comply with 
the Clinical Trial Protocol requirements  
9. Patients who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are considered unsuitable for any 
other reason  
Study 
Procedures:  Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients before any study -related 
procedures are performed.  
The patient’s medical history, demographic, and baseline characteristics, as well as a 
picture of the wound deemed to be CUA, will be collected to determine the patient’s eligibility 
for inclusion, which will be analysed by Dr Vincent Brandenburg (the “gatekeeper ”).  
Blood samples taken routinely from patients will be used as source data for the trial.  
SNF472 will be administered by infusion at a s ingle, constant dosage  for a minimum of 2.5h 
up to the whole duration of the dialysis session. SNF472 will be administered at three 
haemodialysis sessions per week for 12 consecutive weeks . 
Follow -up assessments including lesion documentation and clinical status will be done at  
regular intervals (ulcer size, features, Bates -Jensen Wound tool assessment , pain, and 
Wound  QoL) over a period of 12 weeks  (see Table 1). Additional assessments will include 
safety  and assessment of pharmacokinetics (PK)  and pharmacodynamic  (PD) profile s. One 
sample of blood to measure biomarkers will be taken at the time of PK samples (see Table 
1). 
During the clinical trial, patients will be monitored closely for any adverse events (AEs).  
The time points where blood samp les will be taken to evaluate safety, PK , PD,  and 
biomarkers are specified in the Table of Assessments  (see Table 1). 
Criteria for 
Evaluation:  Safety:  
Safety parameters will include AEs and SAEs, clinical laboratory and haematology, clinical 
chemistry including plasma electrolytes, 12 -lead ECG , and physical examination.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
• Only C max (plasma concentration  at the end of drug infusion ) will be assessed.  
Pharmacodynamics:  
Plasma  samples collected, at baseline and  around the tmax, from all subjects, w ill be used 
for exploratory PD assessment by using an in v itro test to assess the propensity for 
hydroxyapatite crystal formation in plasma . 
Biomarker:  
Serum samples will be collected at baseline and at the end of the study, frozen, and used 
for exploratory biomarker assessment. The final list of biomarkers will be decided at a later 
time point.

Safety:  
All safety paramet ers will be summarised by time -point (where appropriate).  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Individual and mean C max values will be obtained  
Pharmacodynamics:  
Pharmacodynamia will be assessed by an in vitro method to determine the  propensity for 
hydroxyapatite crystal formation in plasma . For each patient, on -study samples will be 
compared to baseline assessment and reported as a % inhibition of hydroxyapatite crystal 
formation compared to baseline.  
Biomarkers:  
Biomarkers will be assessed once the study is finished

2.1. Background  
SNF472 is an intravenous (IV) formulation of the hexasodium salt of myo -inositolhexaphosphate (IP6, phytate). It is 
being devel oped for the treatment of calciphylaxis, as well as for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients 
with end -stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing haemodialysis (HD).  
2.1.1. Properties of Myo -Inositolhexaphosphate  
Myo-inositolhexaphosphate is a naturally -occurring substance found in beans, brown rice, corn, sesame seeds, wheat 
bran, and other high -fibre foods. The calcium salt of IP6 is listed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as 
generally recognised as safe (GRAS) [1]. It is highly polar and poorly absorbed when given orally. When high oral doses 
are administered, IP6 has chelating properties in the gastrointestinal lumen preventing the absorption of cations such 
as calcium, ma gnesium and iron  [2-4].  Due to this property it has been regarded for almost 50  years as an anti -nutrient, 
because it can reduce the gastrointestinal absorption of mineral oligoelements.  
Evidence of the potential health benefits of IP6 ha s emerged in parallel with advances in th e development of analytical 
tools for its determination in biological fluids and tissues. The physicochemical properties of IP6 in biological systems 
make it undetectable with most conventional analytical techniques. Its presence in human tissues and body fluids was 
only shown at the end of the 1990’s, after the development of sensitive assay methods [5-8]. In 1996, IP6 levels were 
shown to be present in human urine [9] and this led to the establishment of a link between IP6 and health, particularly 
with respect to calcium -related diseases, such as renal stones [10-12],  osteoporosis [13-15],  and CVC [16-18].  
When administering SNF472 to animals a s an IV bolus for 28  days, no adverse effects were reported up to 7.5 mg/kg 
in rats and 10 mg/kg in dogs. At 19 and 30 mg/kg , the observed adverse effects were related to the maximum observed 
plasma concentration (C max). The clinical signs in animals suggest that the chelation of cations in the blood in rats 
occurs well above the therapeutic dose levels ( 2 to 3mg/kg). Moreover, extensive telemetry studies in dogs showed 
that doses given by bolus, which leads to QTc prolongation, can be given by  slow infusion without any effects on ECG 
parameters, including QTc. QTc prolongation can be reversed giving IV calcium gluconate. To avoid bolus C max-related 
adverse effects, IP6 will be administered by slow IV infusion during the dialysis session. The IV  route achieves higher 
plasma concentrations of IP6 than is feasible orally and avoids chelation within the gastrointestinal tract.  
2.1.2. Evidence for Efficacy in Calcium -Related Diseases  
Beneficial properties have been attributed to IP6 in oncology  [19-23] and calcium -related diseases (e.g.,  prevention of 
renal lithiasis  [10-12], osteo porosis  [13-15], CVC  [16-18], sialolithiasis  [24], and dental tartar  [25].

PARC BIT. Europa  Building.  07121 Palma de Mallorca. Spain  Myo-inositolhexaphosphate has been shown to prevent vascular calcification in a variety of animal models  [16-18].  
The in vitro  and in vivo  results show that SNF472 prevents the formation of hydroxyapatite  [26]. 
Epidemio logical data show a negative correlation between physiological IP6 levels and CVC. A high dietary intake of 
IP6 is associated with a lower incidence of aortic stenosis and aortic valve calcification  [27]. 
The inhibition of pathological processes of calcification in soft tissue by IP6 is accompanied by a positive effect on 
bone. Both animal models and epidemiologic data suggest that IP6 could be an effective agent for treating osteoporosis 
by reducing bone mineral density loss. Ovar iectomised Wistar rats with an IP6 enhanced diet had reduced loss of bone 
mineral density caused by oestrogen deficiency  [13].  
Myo-inositolhexaphosphate has also been shown to inhibit mineralisation in vitro  of MC3T3 -E1 osteoblasts cultures  
[28]. The potential mechanism is through binding to growing crystals and through induction of osteopontin expression. 
This data suggest that IP6 may regulate physiological bone mineralisation by directly acting extracellularly and by 
serving as a specific sign al at cellular level for the regulation of osteopontin. When incubating human mesenchymal 
stem cells (pre -osteoblasts) with IP6, bone formation activity was enhanced  [29]. 
Two epidemiological studies in 1500 and 180 subjects, showed that low IP6 intake was associated with a decline in 
vertebral and femoral bone mineral density  [14, 15]. A recent epidemiological study in 169  post-menopausal women 
demonstrated that high IP6 exposure over 12  months was associated with lower bone mass loss and decreased 
fracture risk ( lumbar spine and femoral neck) [30]. 
Sodium phytate is also used for Technetium bone scanning (Fyton; 15 mg Na -phytate  [31]). The dose prescribed varies 
from a minimum of 2.5 mg to a maximum 5.0 mg of 99mTc -phytate. This combination is used in medicine as a source 
of radiation for radiotherapy and for diagnostic purposes. Published data shows two half -lives: t ½ α: 2.4 -7.0 min, t ½ β: 
69-105 min, with a distribution into bone and liver, and slow disappearance from liver. It is possible that this reflects 
the half -life of IP6  in humans . 
2.1.3. Disease, Coronary Artery Calcification and Events  
The prevalence of ESRD in the United States of America (USA) is 661,648 patients [32] and according to the European 
Renal Association/European Dialysis and Transplant Association Registry, in 2014 the estimated number of new renal 
replacement therapy patients in the 25  countries of the European Union (EU) was 71  631 [33].There are approximately 
360,000  renal replacement  therapy patients in the EU, with 66% of them being treated by dialysis and the remainder 
living with a functioning graft  [34]. 
Calciphylaxis is a rare disease (ORPHA280062) characterised by progressive painful necrotic skin ulcerations and 
calcification of blood vessels. It occurs mostly, but not exclusively in patients with ESRD and the mean life expectancy 
is even lower than for haemodialysis patients  [35]. The prevalence rate is well below the statutory thresholds for orphan

(FDA). It affects 1% to 4% of the ESRD population  [35]. 
2.2. Rationale for the Clinical Trial  
CUA patients are almost all on dialysis, except for a very small percentage who are non -uraemic. CUA has no specific 
treatment. Calciphylaxis is a life -threatening condition with a high mortality rate. The overall mortality in calciphylaxis 
patients with ESRD is 60 -80%  with a 1 year survival of 45%  [35, 36], whereas non-uremic calciphylaxis appears to 
have a slightly better prognosis with an overall mortality of 52%  [37].  
The difference between survival curves of cases and controls was most striking in the first year and more specifically 
in the first few months after the diagnosis of calciphylaxis  [38]. It is clear that the progression of calciphylaxis is highly 
aggressive with early mortality compared to HD patients without calciphylaxis. The mortality of non -uraemic 
calciphylaxis seems to be about 30% lower than in patients with uraemic calciphylaxis  [36, 37]. 
The pathophysiology of CUA involves  the deposition of calcium in the media of small vessels. This leads to regional, 
extremely painful ischemia leading to ulceration. The lesions tend to appear in the upper and lower limbs, although 
truncal lesions have also been described. In addition to t he pain – requiring opioids to be managed – these patients 
have an increased susceptibility to infections, which is responsible for over 50% of the mortality.  Empirical treatments 
available include sodium thiosulfate, hyperbaric O2, bisphosphonates, surgic al debridement, and other locally 
implemented initiatives. However, these measures do not seem to improve either the course of the wound(s) or the 
high mortality rate  [39-42].   SNF472, due to its innovative mechanism of inhibition of the final common pathway of 
vascular calcification, has the potential to decrease the amount of vascular calci fication in these patients, hence 
shortening the time to healing of the wounds and potentially decreasing mortality rates. This study will address the 
potential of SNF472 to improve the course of the wounds seen in CUA patients.  
Further details can be foun d in the Investigator’s Brochure  [26]. 
See Section  4.3 for justification of the clinical trial design.  
2.3. Risk -Benefit Assessment  
The currently available information of clinical experience with IV IP6 is based on:  
1. Technetium formulations for bone and other scans  
2. A single ascending dose study of SNF472 in healthy volunteers  
3. Both a single and repeated ascending dose study in haem odialysis patients treated for up to 28 days  
SNF472 has been extensively studied in non -clinical models for efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity. The 
main toxicological finding with SNF472 in animals – at high doses only - is hypocalcaemia due to chelation of ionised

prolongation. This is seen at C max values about 100 -fold higher than the expected therapeutic levels. The effect is not 
present in animals when the same bolus doses are administered by slow intravenous infusion. Moreover, SNF472 
does not block the hERG channel ( Study N o SNFSF2010_01 A0189  [43]). The hypocalcaemia and the associated QTc 
effect are rapidly reversed by intravenous calcium gluconate. It is expected that the risk of associated hypocalcaemia 
will be minimal in haemodialysis patients , as slow infusions ranging from 2.5 to 4 hours will be used and the plasma 
calcium concentration is controlled by the calcium content of the dialysis fluid. Furthermore, in the unlikely situation of 
hypocalcaemia symptoms and signs occurring, they can be reversed by the administration of IV calcium -gluconate.  
During the phase I studies with volunteers, single doses from 0.5 mg/kg to 12.5 mg/kg were administered  
(SNFCT2012_03 Part C) . A single dose of 9 mg/kg (SNFCT2012_03 Part C) and repeated doses from one to 20  mg/kg 
were studied (SNFCT2014_03) in haemodialysis patients. In healthy volunteers, SNF472 was generally well tolerated, 
except for the occurrence of mild to moderate local infusion site irritation. Infusion site irritation is not an issue i n HD 
patients, as SNF472 is injected into the HD tubing and pass es through a volume of blood of at least 200  mL before 
reaching the patient’s blood vessels.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events (AEs), assessed as probably related to the IP, were infusion site  pain, infusion 
site erythema, infusion site hypoaesthesia, and infusion site swelling. A single patient on the 9  mg/kg dose developed 
mild tingling of short duration twice (at 30 minutes and 2 hours) during the infusion. No treatment was required. 
Treatme nt-emergent AEs assessed as possibly related to the IP were injection site bruising, headache, dizziness, pain 
in extremity, lip tingling, and myalgia.  
A preliminary analysis of  the SAD study suggested that infusion of 5mg/kg, 9mg/kg and 12.5 mg/kg caused increases 
in QTcB in HVs. These changes mainly occurred within the normal range and values outside the normal range were 
close to the upper limit of normal. No values were seen above 500 mSec (risk of Torsdes des Pointes). Mechanistically 
this can be expla ined by chelation  of ionized Ca. It is also clear from limited data currently available that decreased 
ionized Ca is not a risk in HD patients due to slow infusion of SNF472, dilution of SNF472 in at least 200 cc of blood 
within dialysis machine tubing pri or to entering the blood vessels, and because Ca concentrations are buffered  by the 
Ca content of dialysate  fluid across a semipermeable membrane. Overall, the data available suggest a favourable 
benefit/risk ratio.  
2.3.1. Efficacy  
Myo-inositolhexaphosphate prevents vascular calcification in non -uremic and uremic animal models. Published studies  
[16, 17, 44], as well as the non -clinical studies with SNF472 have shown that parenteral IP6 significantly prevents 
vascular calcification by between 60% and 95% in animal models. The SNF472 efficacy data obtained in animals have 
helped characterise the concentration -effect relati onship and were used to predict potential doses for human clinical

plasma levels in the 5000 -10000 ng/mL ( 7.5-15 µM)  range, depending on the specifi c model used . 
In animal models of calciphylaxis, where a  dystrophic calcification in  rat’s soft tissues is induced, IP6 clearly reduces 
plaque formation (calcinosis cutis) induced by KMnO 4. Calcification was significantly lower in animals receiving IP6. In 
rats sacrificed two days after KMnO 4 treatment calcified deposits were only found in injured tissues of non -IP6 treated 
groups  (Study No EF2004_10  [45, 46]). 
IP6 has also been  shown to inhibit mineralisation in vitro of MC3T3 –E1 osteoblasts cultures  [28]. The potential 
mechanism is through binding to growing HAP crystals and by induction of osteopontin expression. When human 
mesenchymal stem cells (pre -osteoblasts) were incubated with IP6, bone formation activity was enhanced  [29]. 
SNFCT2012_03 Pharmacodynamic Data:  
Pharmacodynamic assessments (calcification potential of plasma  [47]), in healthy volunteers showed  a 80% inhibition 
at 5 mg/kg SNF472, which appeared to plateau thereafter since the effects were the same for the 9 and 12.5 mg/kg 
doses.  
SNFCT2012_03 Pharmacodynamic Data:  
Pharmacodynamic assessments in haemodialysis  patients showed  an 80% inhibition at 9 mg/kg SNF472 .  
SNFCT2014_03 Pharmacodynamic Data:  
Pharmacodynamic assessments in haemodialysis  patients showed an 80% inhibition from 5  mg/kg SNF472 onwards. 
Less than 20% effect was seen at 1 mg/kg . 
 
2.3.2. Safety  
SNF472 was studied in rats and dogs in different toxicology and safety studies, which range from 28  days up to 3 
months of treatment.  
In the 28 -day studies in rats high concentrations produced local irritation. In the 13 -week studies, 15 -minute daily 
intravenous ad ministration of SNF472 in rats and dogs induced no mortality and there were no findings attributable to 
a direct systemic effect of SNF472.   
The cardiovascular and respiratory safety pharmacology was assessed in anaesthetised rats and conscious dogs ( 28-
day toxicology and telemetry). In rats, SNF472 did not show any clinically relevant effects on heart rate or blood 
pressure. In rats and dogs, no effects on respiratory parameters were observed. In dogs, the ECG was evaluated in a 
28-day IV (~6 -minute bolus ) and in a GLP telemetr y study. There was a slight heart rate increase in males and females 
only at the highest dose (30  mg/kg; C max: 359432  ng/mL). These effects appear to be C max-related. In the telemetry

SNF472, calcium, and potassium levels were evaluated. Health status, body weight, cardio -respiratory function, ECG, 
body temperature, total (serum), and free (blood) concentrations of potass ium were not affected by a 2 -hour infusion 
of SNF472 at 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or 30  mg/kg. QTc prolongation was observed with the 6 -minute bolus at 30  mg/kg, 
but no QTc prolongation was seen with the  2-hour infusion at any of the doses. During the 2 -hour infu sion, plasma 
concentrations achieved similar C max values (318180  ng/mL) as with a  bolus  (although this might be an under -
estimation  as it is difficult to pinpoint C max after a bolus injection ). 
Please refer to the Investigators Brochure  [26] for furth er toxicology data.  
SNFCT2012_ 03 Healthy  Volunteers  Safety data 
There were no SAEs, no deaths, and no withdrawals due to AEs during the study. The number of subjects with TEAE s 
(Treatment emergent adverse event) was similar for all dose groups. TEAE s were mostly mild in intensity and 3 
episodes of moderate intensity were reported for the 5.0  mg/kg SNF472 dose and 4 episodes for the 12.5  mg/kg dose.  
No clinically significant chan ges were observed in plasma calcium levels. Although ionised calcium levels were 
measured, several errors occurred in terms of sampling and analysis:  
• As a result of incorrect handling and extraction of samples, the majority of the samples could not be 
analysed.  
• Due to analytical errors, several results in the samples analysed were considered invalid.  
The most complete data from ionised calcium set was obtained for the 5 mg/kg dose. In the 12.5 mg/kg dose, there 
appeared to be a decrease in ionised calcium  within the normal range. The baseline values for the other doses were 
limited. No formal statistical analysis could be done due to the sparse data. In an attempt to get an idea of baseline 
values in the study populations, we used the ionised calcium befor e the infusion of placebo or active drug was started, 
as well as the 12 -hour values (8 hours after C max at a time when no SNF472 was detectable in the blood) and we 
compared with values obtained around t max and per dose. Hence, the ionised calcium concentrations seem to be similar 
to the pooled baseline values with 5  mg/kg of SNF472. With the 9 mg/kg dose, the two available values seem to be at 
the lower end of the distribution of baseline values, whereas with 12.5 mg/kg dose, two of the three available values 
are below the baseline values. The data, although sparse, suggest that there possibly was a dose -related decrease in 
ionised calcium.  
There were, however, no clinical features of hypocalcaemia or clinically relevant increases in QTc observed with any 
of the three doses evaluated. SNF472 concentrations achieved with 12.5 mg/kg were around eight -fold high er than the 
anticipated therapeutic concentrations.

The planned doses in the protocol were 0.5, 1.5, 5 , and 10 mg/kg. PK simulation based on preclinical data predicted 
plasma concentrations (C max; ng/mL) o f 3000, 10000, 30000 and 70000 respectively. After the 1st cohort (0.5 mg/kg), 
the DESC (Dose Escalation Safety Committee) decided to increase the dose to be tested in the 2nd cohort (1.5  mg/kg) 
to 5 mg/kg. This decision was based on PK results showing muc h lower values than the anticipated systemic exposure 
of around 2500 ng/mL as predicted by the PK model (levels were below the limit of quantification of 500 ng/mL). 
According to new PK estimations, 5 mg/kg was expected to produce the initially expected le vel of exposure with 1.5 
mg/kg. The C max with 5 mg/kg was 11571 ng/ml, which is nearly triple the anticipated EC50. Using the PK data of the 
5 mg/kg dose and the safety data after each cohort, the DESC decided to modify the following two doses to reach the  
target concentrations. The doses of 9 and 12.5 mg/kg produced SNF472 plasma levels of 24394 and 42207  ng/mL, 
respectively.

not related with the drug.  
As a conclusion for Phas e 1 clinical trials pe rformed with SNF472 up to date:  treatment -emergent adverse events seen 
exclusively in healthy volunteers and not in HD patients, and assessed as probably related to the investigational 
medicinal product (IMP), were infusion site pain,  infusion site erythema, infusion site hypoesthesia, and infusion site 
swelling. Treatment -emergent adverse events, assessed as possibly related to the IMP, were injection site bruising, 
headache, dizziness, pain in extremity, eyelid injury, and myalgia. T hese effects were not seen in HD patients. A single 
SAE was recorded and was not related to treatment. No clinical significant effects were observed on vital signs, or in 
the laboratory test s.  ECG s, including the QTc interval, was fully evaluated and no clinical ly significant effects were 
observed.   It showed the following:  
o   QTcB prolongation in  HV was found ( all values were below 450 msec) .  Sparse ionised calcium data 
suggested mild hypocalcaemia, correlating with QTcB  
o   QTcB prolongation in HD pat ients occurred with active as well as placebo treatment. It was not 
associated with hypocalcaemia and a relationship to chelation of calcium can be ruled out  
QTc changes are often seen in HD patients and can be due to the composition of the dialysis fluid,  underlying 
cardiovascular disease, changes in Ca, Mg, or K, or du e to medication. As HD patients  showed no significant decreases 
in ionized Ca, SNF472 does not affect hERG channels and  QTcB prolonga tions also occurred in placebos;  an SNF -
related effect is  therefore highly unlikely.

SNF472 administered i.v.  is 100% bioavailable. No compliance issues will be expected with the IV route in patients 
who undergo regular dialysis.

4.1. Overview  
The study will be done together with Prof. Vincent Brandenburg, MD, as the main Principal Investigator and coordinator 
of the study.  To reach the study objectives,  15 evaluable CUA patients  who complete the 12 -week treatment period 
will be enrolled  
The primary investigator, Prof. V Brandenburg,  will be responsible for the diagnosis of CUA together with the locally 
treating physician at the study site (team decision, two -pairs -of-eyes decision). The decision to include the patient into 
the study should be made based on the following criteria  [48]:   
• The diagnosis of calciphylaxis can be made wh en: 
1. The following clinical features are all present, or  
2. Two of the following clinical features and typical histopathological findings are present  
• Clinical features:  
1. A patient on chronic haemodialysis or h aemofiltration or h aemodiafiltration for ch ronic kidney disease  
2. More than 2 painful and non -treatable skin ulcers with concomitant painful purpura  
3. Painful and non -treatable skin ulcers on the trunk, extremities, or penis with concomitant painful purpura  
• Histopathological findings:  
Skin biopsy is recommended only if the three clinical findings presented above are not present and will be left 
to the discretion of the treating physician. Typical histopathological findings of the skin are as follows:  
- Necrosis and ulceration of the skin with calcification of the tunica media and internal elastic membrane of 
small to medium -sized arterioles of dermis and subcutaneous fat  
- Concentric stenosis due to oedematous  intimal thickening of the small to medium -sized arterioles of 
dermis and subcutaneous fat 
Intense pain as primary manifestation followed and associated with cutaneous lesions and palpation of firm calcified 
(leather -like) subcutaneous tissue surrounding the lesion is suggestive of calciphylaxis. Typically , the lesions do not 
occur at sites primar ily affected by venous insufficiency or arterial malperfusion. In view of the painful character of the 
lesions, palpation is left to the discretion of the treating physician.  
The diagnosis of calciphylaxis can be supported by findings obtained from a skin biopsy. Benefits of a biopsy include 
exclusion of other conditions that can mimic calciphylaxis such as vasculitis. The characteristic histological features of 
calciphylaxis include calcification, microthrombosis, and fibrointimal hyperplasia of sma ll dermal and subcutaneous

are required to detect micro calcification. Prof Kerstin Amann, Erlangen, will be the core lab for assessi ng the biopsies  
[39-41].  
Performing a skin biopsy will be left to the discretion of the treating physician and will be performed following the site’s 
SOPs. In case the biopsy is performed as a routine procedure at the site, and the result is positive for CUA, the patient 
is includ ed – as long as the “gatekeeper”, namely Prof Brandenburg,  agrees with the remaining diagnostic parameters. 
If the biopsy is negative, Prof. Brandenburg  will check the biopsy results and will decide if he agrees or disagrees with 
the remaining diagnostic p arameters  to include or not the patient .  
In order to have readable biopsies, the following requisites need to be fulfilled:  
1. site of biopsy: the biopsy should include the ulcer borders, not the necrotic core, and be deep enough to

2. the biopsy material should be fixed in either formalin or paraformaldehyde  or glutaraldehyde   
3. paraffin blocks should be mailed to the core pathology lab (Prof K Amann, Erlangen, Germany),  where 
appropriate stains such as EVG, von Kossa, etc. will be  performed  
Wound treatment of calciphylaxis ulcerations will be performed according to local good clinical practice SOPs of the 
corresponding clinical site irrespective of the fact that the ulceration might be evaluated as treatment target within the 
trial. Such a wound treatment SOP might include the interdisciplinary team approach by nephrologists, dermatologists , 
(plastic) surgeons, and specialized nurses.  
4.2. Endpoints  
4.2.1. Primary endpoint   
• The primary lesion is the largest one – based on longitudinal and transverse measurements - and the one to 
be followed through imaging throughout the duration of the study by taking pictures of the lesion (more details 
concerning the imaging of the lesions  will be addressed in the imaging manual)  
• A maximum of 3 lesions – including the primary one – will be thoroughly assessed during the study  
• Lesion score (Bates -Jensen Wound Assessment tool  [49]) will be performed during Weeks 1, 2, then 4, 6, 8, 
10, 12 , and EOS (FU) visit. Of note, elements of the Bates -Jensen Wound Assessment tool which imply 
probing the wound or measuring its depth are left to the discretion of the treating physician at the site and are 
not compulsory  
4.2.2. Secondary endpoints  
• Wound infecti on, both for the primary and the secondary lesions

4.3. Justification of the Clinical Trial  Design  
Preclinical data with SNF472 supports the hypothesis that the compound is able to prevent cardiovascular calcification 
(CVC) . Calciphylaxis is a rare  condition with a high mortality rate. It is characterised by progressive painful, necrotic, 
skin ulcerations, and calcification of blood vessels. It occurs mostly (98% of cases), but not exclusively, in patients with 
ESRD, where it is also referred to as Calciphic Uremic Arteriolopathy (CUA). “Standard of care” of calciphylaxis is not 
defined by evidence or guidelines. However, experts in the field suggest a personalised management plan, taken from 
each calciphylaxis patient a personalized selection from a  homogenous list of measures to be taken which have 
recently been summarized  [39, 41]. Since there is no standard of care and one-year mortality rates are about 50% -in 
a year , the study is open -label and has no placebo control arm.  
Phase 1 clinical trials with SNF472 have been completed in healthy volunteers and in patients on haemodialysis. The 
impact of renal failure and the effect of dialysis on the PK of SNF472 have been assessed, both in single and multiple 
dosing and up to one month of treatment. Calciphylaxis patients are HD patients;  hence SNF472 is expected to have 
the same PK/PD and safety features .

PARC BIT. Europa  Building.  07121 Palma de Mallorca. Spain  5. STUDY POPULATION  
The clinical trial population will consist of male or female HD patients diagnosed with CUA, who are 18 years or older. 
Participants must be able to provide written informed consent and meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria.  
The Investigator will be required to keep a record of patients who were considered for enrolment but not enrolle d, 
e.g., patient screening log, according to local procedures. This information is necessary to establish that the patient 
population is selected without bias.  
5.1. Number of Patients  
It is planned to include 15 male or female CUA patients  who complete the 12 -week treatment period . 
Patients who leave the clinical trial before being entered into the study will be considered as screening failures and will 
always be replaced. Therefore, sufficient reserve patients should be recruited, where possible. Patients with drawn after 
dosing may be replaced  as needed to obtain 15 patients who complete the 12 -week treatment period . 
See Section  9.5 for a discussion of s ample size.  
5.2. Recruitment  
For this study, both non -hospitalised and hospitalised calciphylaxis patients will be recruited after obtaining written 
informed consent, with a preference for non -hospitalised patients, wherever possible . 
Patients will be approache d to participate in the study during the Screening period.  
5.3. Inclusion Criteria  
Patients who meet the following criteria will be considered eligible to participate in the clinical trial:  
1. Patients with either newly diagnosed CUA  OR recurrent CUA that has been dormant with no skin lesion 
involvement for at least 90 days  from study start (new or recurrent diagnos is must be made  within 5 weeks of 
study start)  
2. Patients who signed the written informed consent to participate in this clini cal trial (prior to any clinical 
trial-related procedures being performed), after reading the Patient Information Sheet and Informed Consent 
Form (ICF), and who had the opportunity to discuss the clinical trial with the Investigator or designee  
3. Males or fe males aged ≥18  
4. Patients on maintenance haemodialysis  
5. Patients with a t least a  minimum level of pain on VAS scale or on pain-killers stronger than NSAIDs

AND have a negative serum pregnancy test at entry . Male patients having sexual relationship in which 
pregnancy can occur should take adequate contraceptive precautions (wear a condom)  (see Section 8.3.1.)  
5.4. Exclusion Criteria  
Patients w ho meet one or more of the following criteria will not be considered eligible to participate in the clinical trial:  
1. Body weight above 150 kg  
2. BMI >35 and central(abdominal) ulcers  
3. History of bisphosphonate treatment within 12 months before  entering into the study  
4. Severely ill patients without reasonable expectation of survival for > 6 months according to the treating 
physician  
5. Patients with scheduled parathyroidectomy during the run -in or study period  
6. Female patients who are either intending to get pregnant or are undergoing treatment to get pregnant , as well 
as breast -feeding females  
7. Participation in another clinical trial with an experimental drug within 90 days  prior the inclusion  
8. Any psychological, emotional problems, any disorders or resultant therapy that is likely to invalidate informed 
consent, or limit the ability of the patient to comply with the Clinical Trial Protocol requirements  
9. Patients who, in the o pinion of the Investigator, are considered unsuitable for any other reason   
5.5. Patient Withdrawal and Replacement  
A patient is defined as having entered the clinical trial when he/she has provided written informed consent. A  withdrawal 
is a patient who receiv es a study patient code and for whom treatment is prematurely terminated for any reason.  
Possible reasons for withdrawal of a subject from the clinical trial:  
• Subject does not fulfil inclusion criteria  
• AE(s)  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Subject lost to follow -up 
• Protocol violation  
• Pregnancy  
• Other reasons as judged by the investigator  (see also  7.1.4 12-Lead Electrocardiogram abnormalities)  
Patients may withdraw consent for participation in the clinical trial at any time without penalty and for any reaso n without 
prejudice to his or her future medical care. The patient does not need to give a reason for withdrawal of consent. The

condition or non -compliance warrants it. The Sponsor or the Regulatory Authorities may request termination of the 
clinical trial if there are concerns about study conduct or safety.  
In all cases, the reason(s) for withdrawal and the primary reason or failure  to provide a reason, must be recorded in 
the Case Report Form  (CRF) .  
If a patient is withdrawn, or chooses to withdraw, from the clinical trial for any reason, the Investigator must make every 
possible effort to perform the evaluations described for the End of Study Visit (see Section  8.2.5 ) or to verify the health 
status of the patient by calling the national death registry. Withdrawn patients may not re -enter the clinical trial.  
Entered patients who leave the clinical trial be fore receiving a study patient code will be considered as screening 
failures and will be replaced.  
Patients who are withdrawn from the study  may be replaced at the discretion of the Sponsor and Principal Investigator.  
Replaced patients will receive the wh ole treatment.  
All patients who experience a clinically significant AE (in the opinion of the Investigator) which is ongoing either at the 
time of withdrawal or at the End of Study Visit, will be followed up at appropriate time intervals until the AE is re solved 
to the satisfaction of the Investigator. Since it is unpredictable how long such a follow -up will take, data from this 
follow -up generated after study finalization will be recorded by the Investigator in the source documents and reported 
to the Drug  Safety and Pharmacovigilance department, but not necessarily collected in the CRF and the database. 
However, full details regarding this follow -up will be described in the Clinical Study Report.

6.1. Identity of the Investigat ional Medicinal Products  
Information regarding the dosage form, appearance, and manufacturer of the IMP are presented below:  
 SNF472  
Code name:  SNF472  
Description:  Transparent  
Presentation:  Liquid  
Strength:  30 mg/ml or 90 mg/ml  
Dose:  Dose will be adjusted by body weight.  
 
To simplify logistics, b ody weights will be divided into 4 body weight categories , in 
order to homogenise the exposure of patients to the drug. The body weight used to 
classify the subject into the four categories will be only the dry body weight  from the 
Screening  visit. 
 
 The dose will be as follows:  
 
Category  Patient Body Weight 
Range (kg)  
  Total Dose 
(mg) per 
patient  
1 50 65.9 400 
2 66 80.9 450 
3 81 110.9 700 
4 111 150 900 
  
All details of the procedure are described in the Pharmacy Manual s for each 
concentration.  
 
SNF472 will be manufactured by Patheon UK Limited  and Laboratorio Reig Jofre S.A. , and packaged, labelled, and 
supplied by CSM (formerly B&C) Group, where  SNF472 will be stored and shipped to either the Pharmacy Services at 
the Clinical Units or directly to the Clinical Units.  
6.2. Dose Rationale  
The dose selected has a range of  5.6 mg SNF472/kg to 9 mg SNF472/kg depending of subject weight . This dose range 
was well tolerated in Phase 1 clinical trials ( SNFCT2012_03 and SNFCT2014_03), and is selected to be the anticipated

To adjust the  dose per ki logram , subjects are divided in to 4 body weight categories (see Pharmacy manual for details).  
Dose levels  of SNF472  from 1 to 20 mg/kg were  tested in Phase1b/2 trials ( SNFCT2014_03) for  1 week and 10 mg/kg 
for 1 month,  without any AE /SAE related with the c ompound . Cmax values expected at the dose selected are not 
exceeding (6 -fold below) the Cmax of 127,291 ng/mL, which was the NOAEL concentration determined in dog pre-
clinical  studies.  
6.3. Supply, Packaging, Labelling and Storage  
The IMP at CSM (formerly B&C) will be stored in accordance to with the manufacturer’s instructions ( -20ºC). The IMP 
will be labelled according to the applicable local health authority, FDA and EMA requirements.  CSM  Group  will send 
the IMP to the Clinical Unit. All IM P shipments will be carried out on dry ice.  
All supplies of SNF472 must be stored  on site at 5ºC (±3ºC) . The preparation of the patient doses will be described in 
the Pharmacy Manual. There will be two Pharmacy Manuals, one for the 30 mg/ml vials and anoth er for the 90 mg/ml 
vials.  The 30 mg/ml vials are packaged in boxes of 9 vials. The 90 mg/ml vials are packaged in boxes of 3 vials.  
6.4. Drug Accountability, Dispensing and Destruction  
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate accountability records of the IMP throughout the clinical trial.  
Each administration of the IMP will be documented in the CRF.  
The Investigator is responsible for returning all unused or partially used IMP to the Sponsor or overseeing the 
destruction of un used IMP. The IMP return or destruction will only occur after the drug accountability has been 
performed, and any discrepancies there may have been resolved by the Clinical Units.  
6.5. Patient Identification  
At the Screening, each patient will be identified usi ng a unique Identification Number.  
Each patient will receive a Patient ID on Day 1 (of the Treatment Period) after eligibility for the clinical trial has been 
confirmed. The first two letters will correspond to the country where the Clinical Unit is locate d, the next two/three digits 
will correspond to the Clinical Unit and the last two /three  digits will correspond to the patient.  
Patients who withdraw or are withdrawn from clinical trial participation for any reason, regardless of whether IMP was 
administe red or not, will retain their Patient ID and the patient will not be allowed to re -enter the clinical trial.

PARC BIT. Europa  Building.  07121 Palma de Mallorca. Spain  6.6. Administration of Investigational Medicinal Products  
The IMP administration will consist of a single IV dose of SNF472 over a minimum of 2.5 and a  maximum of 4 -hour 
period during the patient’s dialysis session. A minimum of 2.5 h of infusion is required.  
The exact infusion starting and stopping times will be recorded in the CRF.  
The appropriate volume of the investigational product will be administ ered as a constant rate IV infusion using a 100  mL 
bag of saline connected directly to the dialysis machine via an IV giving set , but always BEFORE  the dial ysis filter. The 
constant rate IV infusion will be carried out using an infusion pump for saline bags. SNF472 should NOT be 
administered directly intravenously.  
The type of dialysis machine used will be documented in the CRF. The method of administration will be as fo llows:  
 
Figure 2 Cartoon of the method of administration including the dialysis machine . 
For sites belonging to the FRENOVA network please look at reference  [50]. 
Any dosage interruptions will be recorded in the CRF (i.e.,  infusion stop and start times). In case there is an interruption 
of the infusion, once the infusion is re -started, the aim should be to deliver the whole dose, even if this takes longer 
than originally planned.

The Principal Investigator or designees will administer/oversee the administration of all IMPs. In addition, the following 
measures will be taken to ensure treatment compliance:  
• The Investigator will attempt to enrol subjects able to understand and comply with the clinical trial  
• The exact day and the starting and stopping IMP infusion times will be recorded in the CRF  
• The Investigator will maintain accountability records showing the quantities of IMPs received at the Clinical Unit 
and dispensed to each patient  
Any unused IMP, including empty , or partially used containers will be accounted for and returned to the manufacturing 
site for d estruction after obtaining written Sponsor approval.  
6.8. Concomitant Medications  
6.8.1. Prior and Concomitant Medication  
Any medicinal products, prescribed, or OTC taken by a patient other than the IMPs, are considered concomitant 
medication.  
At screening , the patien ts’ medical history and drug history will be recorded in the CRF under the medical history and 
treatment history sections. The drug history of the patient will include all medications taken in the last 6 months prior 
to study start. After screening , all me dication (along with their daily dosage, duration, and reasons for administration) 
taken by patients will be recorded in the CRF under the concomitant medication section.   
At each subsequent clinical trial visit, patients will be asked about what concomita nt medications they have taken since 
the last visit. Any changes in the dose or dosing regimen of the concomitant medication must be recorded in the CRF.

Refer to Table 1 for information regarding when each assessment  will be performed.  
For this clinical trial, a paper CRF will be utilised for data collection at the clinical sites.  Data from the CRFs  will be 
entered into a clinical database using the DataFax software hosted by DF/net Research, Inc.  
At baseline and for inclusion criterion purposes, several pictures of the main wound can be taken and emailed to  the 
study PI so that he can decide which one is the one to be designated as “the” main wound. In following visits, the same 
wound has to be imaged so that the course of the wound can be assessed.  
Image  analysis software will be used . Each patient will have a personali sed colour  reference card with a uni que 
barcode. This card should be placed next to the skin lesion before the image is taken , so that all wound images can 
be normali sed in geometry, colour , and contrast in order to support quantitative measurements.  The pictures of the 
wounds, primary , seco ndary , and tertiary , will be transferred to the database where they can be easily linked to their 
corresponding visit.  
7.1. Safety Variables  
7.1.1. Medical History, Demographic, and Anthropometric Information  
The medical history comprises:  
• Previous illnesses and surgical procedures  
• Family history  
• History of drug and alcohol abuse  
The treatment history will include all medication the patient has taken or is currently taking up until the Screening visit.  
The following demographic and anthropometric information will be recorded at the Screening Visit:  
• Age 
• Sex 
• Race (Caucasian, Hispanic, African -American, Asian or other)  
• Ethnicity (Latino or Hispanic, non -Latino or non -Hispanic)  
• Body we ight (dry weight), without shoes  (kg) (if without shoes is not possi ble then same conditions at each

PARC BIT. Europa  Building.  07121 Palma de Mallorca. Spain  7.1.2. Adverse Events  
7.1.2.1.  Management of Adverse Events  
The Investigator will carefully monitor each patient for AEs. In addition, the information on AEs will be obtained by 
regular questioning of each patient by the clinical trial staff. No leading questions should be asked. When an AE occurs, 
the Investigator will decide whether to withdraw the patient from the clinical trial and/or initiate appropriate treatment.  
In the case of any event requiring medical in tervention occurring during the Treatment Period, the Investigator will 
institute general supportive measures including, where necessary, respiratory assistance and cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation.  
7.1.2.2.  Definitions  
An adverse event ( AE) is any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease that appears or worsens in a 
subject or clinical investigation subject during the period of observation in a clinical study .  
The adverse event may be any of the following:  
- A new illness,  
- An exacerb ation of a sign or symptom of the underlying condition under treatment or of a concomitant illness 
(including abnormal laboratory finding ) 
- Unrelated to participation in the clinical study or an effect of the study medication or comparator drug, or  
- A combin ation of one or more of the above factors.  
No causal relationship with the study medication is implied by the use of the term “adverse event.” An exacerbation of 
a pre -existing condition/illness is defined as a more frequent occurrence or as an increase in the severity of the pre -
existing condition/illness during the study. Planned or elective surgical or invasive procedures for pre -existing 
conditions that have not worsened are not adverse events. However, any complication that occurs during a p lanned or 
elective surgery is an adverse event. (If the event fits the seriousness criteria, such as an extended hospitalisation, it 
will be considered a serious adverse event.) Conditions leading to unplanned surgical procedures may be adverse 
events.  
In order for the Sponsor to collect additional information about the clinically important laboratory or diagnostic tests 
(eg, blood, urinalysis, ECG, imaging) abnormalities, at a minimum, the following abnormalities should be captured on 
the AE CRF:  
• Any test result th at meets the criteria for a SAE  
• Any test abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity that is ne w or has significantly worsened  
• Any test abnormality that required the subject to have study medicat ion discontinued or interrupted

PARC BIT. Europa  Building.  07121 Palma de Mallorca. Spain  • Any te st abnormality that required the subject to receive specific corrective therapy, close observation, more 
frequent follow -up assessment, or f urther diagnostic investigation  
Laboratory test abnormalities may not be of clinical significance in the absence of:  
• Clinical symptoms  
• Change in lifestyle  
• Need for intervention  
Only clinically significant test abnormalities should be reported as AEs.  Determination of the clinical significance of 
test abnormalities is the responsibility of the Investigator . In particula r, Grade  1 or 2  haematology, chemistry, 
abnormalities should be carefully considered for clinical relevance by the Investigator, as they are less likely to be of 
clinical significance as compared to Grade  3 or Grade 4 abnormalities.  H aematology and chemis try abnormalities 
determined to be clinically relevant will be assigned a severity rating by the Investigator.  A clinical diagnosis, rather 
than the changes in laboratory or other assessment should be recorded on the CRF as appropriate (eg, anaemia  
versus  low haemoglobin  value, bundle branch block rather than abnormal ECG).  
All AEs, including intercurrent illnesses, occurring during the clinical trial will be documented in the CRF. Concomitant 
illnesses that existed prior to entry into the clinical trial w ill not be considered AEs unless they worsen during the 
Treatment Period. Pre -existing conditions will be recorded in the CRF on the Medical History or appropriate page.  
7.1.2.3.  Assessment of Adverse Events  
The Investigator will assess each AE according to the cat egories discussed in the sections below.  
7.1.2.3.1.  Seriousness  
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening; this means that the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not mean that 
the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe  
• Requires hospitalisation or prolongation in existing hospitalisation  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
•  Is a congenital anomaly or a birth defect  
• Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization, but may 
be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition

PARC BIT. Europa  Building.  07121 Palma de Mallorca. Spain  Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscra sias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation, or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
Note that an AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” for reporting as an SAE if, in the view 
of either the Investigator or  the Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not 
include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
The following events do not meet the definition of an  SAE with regard to hospitalization:  planned hospitalization  for a 
condition present prior to the subject’s enrolment  in the study, hospitalization of the subject for compliance/convenience 
reasons, planned hospitalization for an elective medical/surgical  procedure, scheduled treatments, or routine 
check -ups, or a hospitalization or an emergency room visit lasting less than 24  hours.  
7.1.2.3.2.  Intensity  
The Investigator will assess the severity of AEs according to the following definitions:  
• Grade 1 (Mild):  asymptomatic or transient, short in duration (<  1 week), no change in lifestyle, and/or no 
medications required.  
• Grade 2 (Moderate):  symptomatic, duration (1 to 2  weeks), alters lifestyle occasionally, medication relieves 
symptoms (may be prescription), a nd/or study medication is continued.   
• Grade 3 (Severe): prolonged symptoms, reversible, major functional impairment; prescription medications 
provide partial relief; may be hospitalized <  24 hours; temporary or permanent study medication 
discontinuation.  
• Grade 4 (includes Life threatening):  at risk of death; substantial disability, especially if permanent; 
hospitalized >  24 hours; permanent study medication discontinued.  
7.1.2.3.3.  Causality  
The Investigator will assess the causality/relationship between the IMP and  the AE and record that assessment in the 
CRF. The most likely cause of an AE/SAE (e.g.,  disease under treatment, concomitant disease, concomitant 
medication, other) will be indicated in the CRF with details of the concomitant disease, medication, or other  cause.  
The causal relationship of the AE to IMP will be described in terms of:  
• Possible: the AE:  
- Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP

administered to the patient  
- Follows a known pattern of response to the IMP  
• Unlikely: the AE:  
- Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP  
- Could be reasonably explained by th e patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other 
therapies administered to the patient  
- Does not follow a known pattern of response to the IMP  
- Does not reappear or worsen upon re -challenge  
• Not related:  
- The AE does not meet the above crit eria 
- There is sufficient information that the aetiology of the AE is not related to the IMP  
The relatedness of SAEs will also be assessed and documented  on the appropriate CRF page . 
7.1.2.4.  Recording of Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be collected from the time a patient signs the ICF until the Follow -up Visit.  
All AEs,  regardless of the relationship to IMP, must be recorded in the source documents (e.g., medical record)  and 
will be recorded on the appropriate CRF pages, and documents provided by the Sponso r. 
All AE reports should contain a brief description of the event, date, and time of onset, date and time of resolution, 
intensity, treatment required, relationship to IMP, action taken with the IMP, outcome, and whether the event is 
classified as serious.   
Serious adverse events should be collected for up to 30  days after the last dose of the IMP  for subjects unless the 
subject has withdrawn consent.  This could be collected as a phone call.  
7.1.2.5.  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur during the  period of observation (from the first administration of the IMP until the Follow -up Visit) 
whether considered to be associated with the IMP or not, must be reported within 24  hours after knowledge of the SAE 
by email or fax to the Pharmacovigilance Department .

PARC BIT. Europa  Building.  07121 Palma de Mallorca. Spain  7.1.2.6.  Follow -up of Adverse Events  
All AEs experienced by a patient, irrespective of the suspected causality, will be monitored until the event has resolved, 
any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline or stabilised at a level acceptable to the Investigator and 
Medical Monitor, until there is a satisfactory explanation for the cha nges observed, or until the patient is lost to follow -up. 
7.1.2.7.  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
Any AE that is serious or associated with the use of the IMP and SUSARs ha ve additional reporting requirements, as 
described below:  
• If the SUSAR is fa tal or life -threatening, associated with the use of the IMP, and unexpected, Regulatory 
Authorities , the EC /IRB, and Investigators  will be notified within 7  calendar days after the Sponsor learns of the  
serious adverse  event. Additional follow -up (cause of death, autopsy report, hospital report) information will be 
reported within an additional 8  days (15  days in total)  
• If the SUSAR is not fatal or life -threatening but is otherwise serious, associated with the use of the IMP, and 
unexpected, Regulatory Authorities , the EC/IRB  and the Investigators  will be notified within 15  calendar days after 
the Sponsor learns of the  serious adverse  event  
The Sponsor will also provide annual safety reports to the Regulatory Authorities and the EC responsible for the clinical 
trial. These updates will include information on SUSARs and other relevant safety findings.  
7.1.2.8.  Periodic Independent Safety Monitoring  
An independent medical monitor will evaluate the totality of safety information collected in the trial at the following time 
points: 1) when the first 5 patients have completed a full 12 weeks of treatment; 2) when the first 10 patients have 
completed a full 12 weeks of treatment; and at End of Study. The independent medical monitor will be appointed prior 
to the first time point and will be a qualified individual who is not directly involved in study conduct and is not a direct 
employee of the S ponsor or any Principle Investigator in the study.  
7.1.2.9.  Pregnancy  
If a female clinical trial participant or a female partner of a male clinical trial participant who has been exposed to the 
IMP becomes pregnant, the course and outcome of the pregnancy should b e monitored and documented.  Pregnancy 
is not an AE; however, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor immediately of the pregnancy by submitting a 
completed SAE report form (for tracking purposes) and provide any available follow up information on the Pr egnancy 
Outcome Report Form, including perinatal and neonatal outcome.  Protocol required procedures for study withdrawal 
must be performed on pregnant female subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (eg, X -ray studies).  Other 
appropriate follow -up pro cedures should be considered if indicated.

PARC BIT. Europa  Building.  07121 Palma de Mallorca. Spain  7.1.3. Laboratory Assessments  
The safety laboratory assessments will be performed in accordance to the Schedule of Assessments: Table 1. 
Blood samples will be collected using a standard output from the dialysis lines ( Figure 2). 
The safety laboratory analyses in blood will be performed at the local clinical units in EU and will be performed at a 
central laboratory in USA, according to their validated methods.  
Haematology and Clinical Chemistry  
• Haematology : Haemoglobin, haem atocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, mean 
corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte and leucocyte count and differential (absolute and 
percentage), and platelets  
• Clinical chemistry (serum) : Creatinine, CK, total protein, albumin, cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides , glucose, 
BUN, bilirubin, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, ALP, AST, ALT , and gamma -glutamyl transferase  
• Clinical chemistry  (serum) : magnesium , iron (ferritin and transferri n) 
• Heavy metals ( total blood ; collected in sodium heparin  or EDTA (dark blue )): zinc  
• Ionised calcium (total blood)   
• Hb1Ac ( total blood ) 
• PTH (plasma, EDTA): We recommend blood samples for PTH measurement should be taken into tubes containing 
EDTA, ideally between 10:00 and 16:00 , and plasma separated within 24  h of venepuncture. Plasma samples 
should be stored at 4°C and analysed within 72 h of venepuncture.  If plasma is not available, PTH from serum 
samples is also accepted.  
Pregnancy Test  
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening, in female patients of childbearing potential, followed by a urine 
pregnancy test on a monthly basis, should urine be available.  
7.1.4. 12-Lead Electrocardiograms  
A 12-lead ECG will be obtained with the patient supine or semi -reclined and will be performed in accordance with the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). 
The Investigator will perform an overall evaluation of the ECG strips for safety purposes and the recording will be 
reported as “normal”, “abnormal not clinically significant (NCS)”, or “ab normal clinically significant (CS)”. Abnormalities

QTcF will be measured.  
Electrocardiogram Abnormalities  
As QTc prolongation is common in ES RD patients on HD and can occur due to underlying CV C disease, haemodialysis, 
sodium thiosul fate, calcimimetics , electrolyte disturbances (Ca, Mg and K) and overdoses of SNF472, careful QTc 
assessment is essential. Any QTc interval using Bazett’s formula (QTcB) >500  ms or increase >60  ms from baseline 
in 1 or more subjects as confirmed with consecutive ECGs will be  considered abnormal. It will be reported as an AE if 
the investigator considers it clinically relevant. Investigators should use their discretion to monitor the subject, apply 
appropriate management and observe until the QTcB has decreased. At the discret ion of the investigator, patients with 
persistent QTc prolongation may be withdrawn from the tria l. 
7.1.5. Physical Examinations  
The physical examinations will be performed in accordance with the Schedule of Assessments:  Table 1. 
The physical examination comprises a routine medical examination.  
The routine medical examination will be recorded as “normal” or “abnormal”.  
7.2. Haemodialysis -related Events  
The following  events are known to occur during dialysis treatments:  
• Hypotension  
• Muscle cramps  
• Disequilibrium syndrome  
• Nausea and vomiting  
• Headache  
• Chest pain  
• Itching  
• Fever and chills  
• Pyrogen reaction  
• Hypertension  
Occurrence of these events during the dialysis treatment procedure should be recorded in the CRF and indicated as 
haemodialysis -related events.  If any of these events are considered to be unrelated to the hemodialysis treatment 
procedure, they should be recorded as standard adverse events.

The assessment of th e degree of pain a patient feel s will be measured with the VAS.  
To assess the course of healing of the ulcers, the Bates Jensen Wound Assessment Tool will be used. Of note, 
elements of the Bates -Jensen Wound Assessment tool which imply probing the wound or measuring its depth are left 
to the discretion of the treating physician at the site and are not compulsory.

7.5.1. Pain Score -VAS 
The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) will be used to assess pain , as per the patient . A VAS is a measurement instrument 
that aims to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot 
easily be directly measured. For example, the amount of pain that a patient feels ranges across a continuum from none 
to an extreme amount of pain.  
Operationally , a VAS is usually a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by word descriptors at each end, as 
illustrated in 
 
Figure  4The patient marks on the l ine the point that he feels represents his perception of his current status. The VAS 
score is determined by measuring in millimetres from the left hand end of the line to the point that the patient marks  
[51].

7.5.2. Lesion Score – Bates -Jensen Wound Assessment Tool  
The site investigator will use the  Bates Jensen Wound Assessment Tool (BWAT) to assess the course of the lesion. 
BWAT is a measuring instrument used to assess and monitor healing in pressure ulcers and other chronic wounds [49]. 
It is not, however, specific for CUA. It uses a numerical scale to rate wound characteristics from bes t to worst possible. 
It consists of 15 items, two of which (location and shape) are not scored. Scored items are:  
• Size 
• Depth  
• Edges  
• Undermining or pockets  
• Necrotic tissue type  
• Necrotic tissue amount  
• Exudate type  
• Exudate amount  
• Surrounding skin colour  
• Peripheral tissue oedema  
• Peripheral tissue induration  
• Granulation tissue  
• Epithelialization

PARC BIT. Europa  Building.  07121 Palma de Mallorca. Spain  Each item should be scored from 1 to 5, with 1 being the best for that attribute.  
Of note, elements of the Bates -Jensen Wound Assessment tool which imply probing the wound or measuring its depth 
are left to the discretion of the treating physician at the site and are not compulsory. The BJWAT total score will be 
calculated  using a standard methodology for  any missing values . Additionally,  scores for the component  items will be 
assessed longitudinally.  Improvement or worsening will be assessed in the total  score and the individual component 
scores.  
7.5.2.1.  Image Acquisition Process  
Pictures will be taken from the patient’s lesions at the visits detailed in the Schedule of Assessments Table 1.  
At baseline  and for inclusion criterion purposes , as per the site investigator, several pictures of the primary lesion 
should be taken in order for the PI (Dr Brandenburg)  to decide which image is the best quality image, to include in the 
database , as the primary lesion. Thereafter, all other pictures of the primary lesion should be taken in the same way 
(light, angle, etc .) as the baseline one  so that the course of the wound can be assessed . Color reference cards with an 
individual barcode (unique patient identifier) which will be recorded into the CRF an d optimized for automatic detection 
and reading should be placed next to the lesion before any image is taken.  
Similar rules apply for the secondary  and tertiary  lesions.  
All pictures will be uploaded into the database. The pictures will be linked to their corresponding visit. 
7.5.2.2.  Image Analys es 
Lesion images  will be analysed using the following methods.  
1.       Two reviewers will independently perform a two -step review of the lesion images:  
a.       The first step is a patient -level analysis in which the baseline and final images for each patient are de -
identified with respect to order and are randomly labeled as image A or image B. Each reviewer will 
compare the images to assess whether image A is worse, image B is wors e, or if there is no difference

will discuss the case together to attempt concordance.  
b.       The second step is a review of all patient images taken as baseline and every two weeks during the 
12-week trial. Each on -treatment analysis will be compared to baseline and scored as worsened, 
improved, or no change. The aggregated categorical scores across all patients for each time point 
will be correlated with  the aggregate BWAT total score for each corresponding time point. If there is 
discordance between the reviewers’ assessments, the reviewers will discuss the case together to 
attempt concordance.

8.1. Schedule and Time of Assessments  
The Schedule of Assessments to be performed for each part of the clinical trial is described in  Table 1. 
The following priority order will be in effect when more than one assessment is required at a particular time -point, with 
PK blood sampling be ing performed nearest to the specified time:  
1. Lesion and pain score  
2. Blood samples for safety assessments  
3. 12 Lead ECG  
4. PK and biomarker blood sampling  
5. HRQOL score  (wound QOL)  
8.2. Assessments by Visit  
The Schedule of Assessments to be performed for each part of the clinical trial can be found in  Table 1. 
8.2.1. Screening Period W -2 to Day -1 (hence the screening/recruitment period is up to 2 weeks)  
Potential patients  for the inclusion in the clinical trial will be informed about the study and asked to attend the Screening 
Visit within 14  days before receiving the first dose of IMP. The Investigator has to confirm that patients are on standard 
of care as per the site’s  SOPs. Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients before any screening 
procedures are performed. Patients will be fully informed of their responsibilities, of all the procedures expected to be 
performed in the clinical trial, the possible risks, disadvantages and potential benefits of being dosed with SNF472 and 
their rights while participating in the clinical trial. They will have the opportunity to ask questions and have time to 
consider participation. If the patient wishes to participate  in the clinical trial, they will be asked to sign and date the ICF.  
The Screening Visit will be carried out and a 12 -Lead ECG, will be taken, demographic , including body weight (dry 
weight)  and anthropometric data, physical examination, medical history and treatment history (prior medication) data. 
Safety laboratory assessments (including clinical chemistry, haematology  and a serum pregnancy test ) will be taken 
from the routine safety labora tory analysis  whenever possible .  
The patient will be asked to draw the level of pain experienced on the VAS . 
Patients will be considered eligible to participate in the clinical trial if they successfully complete the Screening Visit, 
meet all the inclusio n criteria, and the lesion is considered to fulfil CUA requirements, as per Dr Vincent Brandenburg .

that the patient is not adequ ately responding to the SOC.  
8.2.2. Expected Duration of the Clinical trial  
The maximum expected duration for an individual patient of the clinical trial, including Screening and Follow -up, will be 
approximately 15 weeks.  
8.2.3. Treatment Period W1 -W12 
All eligible pat ients will receive SNF472 during their haemodialysis sessions. SNF472 will be administered at each 
dialysis session for the entire duration of the study. The duration of infusion of SNF472 will range from 2.5 h up to 
maximum time on dialysis , which would b e 4 h . SNF472 should NOT be administered directly intravenously. SNF472 
should NOT be administered concomitantly with STS, should STS be used. In case both drugs would be administered 
to the patient, the administration of SNF472 should be stopped 30 minutes before the end of the dialysis session to 
allow the STS infusion to take place in the last 30 minutes of the session.  
In the event of Fe+ administration, the infusion of SNF472 should be stopped BEFORE starting the Fe+ infusion.  
For other assessmen ts please check Table 1. 
8.2.4. Follow -Up Visit W13  
All patients will undergo a physical examination, a 12 -lead ECG, and be assessed for resolution of pending  AEs and 
SAEs. In addition, safety laboratory assessments will be performed and the pain and lesion scores will be assessed.  
8.2.5. End of Study Visit  
Patients who withdraw consent or are withdrawn from the clinical trial should, if possible, have an End of Study  Visit. 
This visit should take place as soon as possible after the patient has withdrawn consent or has withdrawn from the 
clinical trial. The assessments and procedures scheduled for the Follow -Up Visit should be performed at the End of

8.3.1. Contraception Requirements  
The use of highly effective contraception methods to prevent pregnancy, of a female participant or a female partner of 
a male participant, from the day o f dosing and for 3 months after  the follow -up visit, is necessa ry.  
•       Male patients:  
o   Male patient who have not had a vasectomy and have a female partner of childbearing potential, must 
use a condom with spermicide when having heterosexual intercourse, from the time the consent form 
is signed until 3 months a fter the last dose of study drug  
o   If the male patient’s partner is of childbearing potential or if she has had a tubal ligation without having 
had her ovaries taken out and she is taking a hormonal contraceptive, she may choose to continue 
takin g the hormonal contraceptive but it is strongly recommended to add 1 non -hormonal method of 
contraception (i.e., male condom with spermicide, female condom, diaphragm with spermicidal jelly 
or a cervical cap). We strongly recommend the partner, must use re liable forms of contraception 
during the study and for 3 months after the last dose of study drug  
•       Highly effective contraceptive methods are:  
o Combined (estrogen and progesterone containing) oral, intravaginal or transdermal contraceptive 
associated  with inhibition of ovulation + condom with spermicide  
o Progesteron -only oral, injectable or implantable hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation + condom with spermicide  
o   Intra uterine device (IUD) + condom with spermicide  
o   True abstin ence: When this is in line with  the patient´s preferred and usual lifestyle. Periodic 
abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal (monitoring of your body temperature), post -
ovulation methods), and withdrawal are NOT acceptable methods of c ontraception.  
o   Male sterilisation (with the appropriate post -vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the 
ejaculate).  
•       Female patients must be in one of the cases described below:  
o   Absence of menstruation for 12 consecutive months ( menopause) and the doctor confirms they are 
postmenopausal  
o   Both ovaries and uterus have been removed by surgery  
o   Cannot get pregnant due to having ovarian problems (confirmed by a doctor ) 
o   If of childbearing potential, the female patient and their partner have to use highly effective forms of 
contraception (see above) during the study and for 3 months after the last dose of study drug

The plasma SNF472 PK  parameter, Cmax, will be ca lculated , individual and mean .  
9.5. Determination of Sample Size  
Based on recent historical data from a U.S. large dialysis provider organization, approximately 25% of calciphylaxis 
skin lesions are considered to be improved over a 3 -6 month period (data unpublished; personal communication). A 
total of 15 subjects  who c omplete 12 -week of treatment  was determined necessary to show with 80% power that the 
percentage of subjects for which the primary ulcer is totally or partially healed after 12 weeks of treatment  is greater 
than 25%. For these calculations, it was assumed that the percentage of totally or partially healed subjects for SNF472 
will be 60%.

I, the undersigned, have read this protocol and confirm that to the best of my knowledge it 
accurately describes the planned conduct of the study.
Date 

PMN310-101 Version 2.0; 22 September 2023 
PMN310 ProMIS Neurosciences 
Confidential Page 4 with standardized meals provided during inpatient stay.  On Day 1, subjects 
will be randomly assigned to receive either a single infusion of PMN310 or 
placebo (6:2 ratio).  After randomization on Day 1, study drug will be 
administered followed by the collection of safety, tolerability, and PK data 
for 12 weeks postdose (outpatient follow-up period).  Following completion 
of the postdose outpatient follow-up period, subjects may return for an 
optional follow-up visit to evaluate PK, ADA, and exploratory biomarkers, 
if warranted by previous data.  The decision to recommend the optional 
follow-up visit will be made by the Sponsor and communicated to the 
Investigator who will notify the subject about the timing of the optional 
visit. 
All dose cohorts will have lumbar punctures (LPs) performed on Day 3 and 
Day 29.  The timing of additional LPs will be based on available serum PK 
and CSF concentrations of PMN310 from prior cohorts.  The timing of LPs 
will be communicated to the Investigator who will inform the subject.  No 
subject will have more than 3 total LPs. 
Dose Escalation Rules Each dose cohort will consist of 8 subjects (6:2; PMN310:placebo).  To 
evaluate the short term safety and tolerability of PMN310, each cohort will 
enroll a sentinel group of 2 subjects (1:1, PMN310:placebo) who will be 
dosed prior to dosing the remaining 6 subjects in the cohort (5:1, 
PMN310:placebo).  The Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review all 
safety data collected through 48 hours postdose from the 2 sentinel subjects 
to determine the acceptability of proceeding with dosing of the remaining 
6 subjects in the cohort. 
Dose escalation to the next cohort will only occur after approval by the 
SRC.  The SRC will determine the acceptability of proceeding with 
enrollment of the next cohort based on review of safety and any available 
PK data at the time of review through 7 days postdose for a minimum of 
6 of 8 subjects per cohort. 
In the event that important safety concerns are observed at any time during 
the study, administration of study drug will be paused, subjects in the 
subsequent cohort(s) will not receive further study drug until further review 
of the safety data has occurred, and subsequent recommendations and 
approval have been provided by the SRC.  
Study Population: Inclusion Criteria: 
Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for 
this study: 
1. Male and females, 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive, at time of Screening. 
a. Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be breastfeeding 
and must have no plans to become pregnant during the course of the 
study through 120 days after infusion of study drug.  Female 
subjects of childbearing potential who are heterosexual must agree 
to use 1 of the following methods of contraception considered to be 
highly effective (i.e., results in < 1% failure rate when used 
consistently and correctly) from Screening through 120 days after 
the last dose of study drug:

Confidential Page 5 Intrauterine device or intrauterine system in place for at least 
3 months prior to first dose. 
  4 months prior to participation.  
Vasectomy in the partner is considered to be highly effective 
only if the partner is the sole sexual partner of the female 
subject of child-bearing potential and the vasectomy (as 
communicated to the subject by the vasectomized partner) was 
medically assessed as surgically successful. 
 Stable hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation (including by not limited to approved oral, 
transdermal, or depot regimen) for at least 3 months prior to 
first dose. 
b. Female subjects of non-childbearing potential must have evidence 
from their medical history indicating that they are not of 
childbearing potential and must not currently be breastfeeding.  
Accepted evidence (self-reported medical history is acceptable) 
includes:  History of sterilization surgery, including tubal ligation, tubal 
occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral 
oophorectomy. 
 Postmenopausal status (12 months with no menses and no 
alternative cause).  Postmenopausal status will be confirmed 
with a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) test at Screening 
(FSH > 40 mIU/mL).  If there is any doubt about a female -menopausal status the subject must use a form of 
highly effective birth control as noted in Inclusion Criterion 1a. 
2. Any non-vasectomized male subjects must agree to use barrier 
contraceptives (male or female partner condom, diaphragm, cervical 
cap, sponges) plus spermicide for 200 days after dosing.  No restrictions 
are required for a vasectomized male provided his vasectomy was 
performed 4 months or more prior to study start.  A male who has been 
vasectomized less than 4 months prior to study start must follow the 
same restrictions as a non-vasectomized male. 
3. Males must not donate sperm for at least 200 days after dosing. 
4. Female subjects must agree not to donate or preserve eggs (ova) for 
120 days after dosing. 
5. Medically healthy with no clinically significant or relevant 
abnormalities in medical history, physical exam, vital signs, ECG, or 
laboratory evaluations (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) as 
assessed by the Investigator.  At the Ievaluations may be repeated at Screening or Baseline (pre-dose) to 
assess clinical significance of abnormalities prior to dosing. 
6. Confirmed to have acceptable venous access for blood collections and 
IV dosing administration of study medication. 
7. Has provided written informed consent. 
8. Body mass index is between 18 and 32 kg/m2 (inclusive).

  Planned doses include 
175 mg, 350 mg, 700 mg, 1400 mg and 2800 mg (optional).  Additional dose levels may be 
added to explore intermediate doses in lieu of the predefined doses.  Any intermediate doses will 
be selected in accordance with the safety and tolerability data reviewed by the Safety Review 
Committee (SRC), and will not exceed a single dose of 2800 mg. 
1.5. Benefit-Risk Assessment 
PMN310 has not yet been evaluated in humans and the predicted safety and toxicology findings 
can only be garnered by the completed GLP-compliant toxicology studies in non-human 
primates.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
The safety of PMN310 will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring AEs, using criteria 
proposed by Sibille et al., 2010 , clinical laboratory assessments, vital sign measurements, 
physical and neurological examinations, 12-lead ECG measurements, and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) evaluations. 
There are no expected direct health benefits to subjects in Study PMN310-101.  The safety, 
tolerability, and PK data collected in Study PMN310-101 will provide initial data supporting the 
evaluation of PMN310 in patients with AD.

3.1. Design Characteristics 
This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose clinical study of PMN310 in 
healthy adult volunteers.  The study aims to establish the safety, tolerability, and PK of a single 
IV infusion of PMN310.  
Subjects who provide written informed consent and meet all eligibility criteria will be admitted 
to the study clinic on Day -1 (i.e., the day prior to dosing with PMN310 or placebo).  Subjects 
will be domiciled for 4 nights with standardized meals provided during inpatient stay.  On Day 1, 
subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either a single infusion of PMN310 or placebo (6:2 
ratio).  After randomization on Day 1, study drug will be administered followed by the collection 
of safety, tolerability, and PK data for 12 weeks postdose (outpatient follow-up period).  
Following completion of the postdose outpatient follow-up period, subjects may return for an 
optional follow-up visit to evaluate PK, ADA, and exploratory biomarkers, if warranted by 
previous data.  The decision to recommend the optional follow-up visit will be made by the 
Sponsor and communicated to the Investigator who will notify the subject about the timing of the 
optional visit. 
All dose cohorts will have lumbar punctures (LPs) performed on Day 3 and Day 29.  The timing 
of additional LPs will be based on available serum PK and CSF concentrations of PMN310 from 
prior cohorts.  The timing of LPs will be communicated to the Investigator who will inform the 
subject.  No subject will have more than 3 total LPs. 
A detailed summary of the schedule of events is available in Appendix 1 . 
3.1.1. Dose Escalation Rules 
Each dose cohort will consist of 8 subjects (6:2; PMN310:placebo).  To evaluate the short term 
safety and tolerability of PMN310, each cohort will enroll a sentinel group of 2 subjects (1:1, 
PMN310:placebo) who will be dosed prior to dosing the remaining 6 subjects in the cohort (5:1, 
PMN310:placebo).  The first two sentinel subjects for Cohort 1 (age < 50) will have MRIs 
performed and read locally.  The SRC will review all safety data collected through 48 hours 
postdose from the 2 sentinel subjects to determine the acceptability of proceeding with dosing of 
the remaining 6 subjects in the cohort.  Additional details on the SRC are provided in 
Section 3.1.2 . 
Dose escalation to the next cohort will only occur after approval by the SRC.  The SRC will 
determine the acceptability of proceeding with enrollment of the next cohort based on review of 
safety and any available PK data at the time of review through 7 days postdose for a minimum of 
6 of 8 subjects per cohort.  Doses to be evaluated are presented in Section 5.2.1 . 
In the event that important safety concerns are observed at any time during the study, 
administration of study drug will be paused, subjects in the subsequent cohort(s) will not receive 
further study drug until further review of the safety data has occurred, and subsequent 
recommendations and approval have been provided by the SRC.  Dose escalation/stopping rules 
are detailed in Section 5.5 . 
A schematic illustrating the study design is provided in Figure 1. 
PMN310-101 Version 2.0; 22 September 2023 
PMN310 ProMIS Neurosciences 
Confidential Page 24 3.1.2. Safety Review Committee 
The SRC will be responsible for the review of safety and any available PK data at the time of 
review, and making determinations regarding the acceptability of proceeding with dosing of the 
remaining 6 subjects in a cohort (based on review of sentinel subjects) and dose escalation to the 
next cohort.  The SRC will be comprised of the Study Investigator, Medical Monitor, and 
Sponsor Medical Director.  At a minimum, the SRC will review safety data assessments 
post-dose for a minimum of 6 of 8 subjects per cohort prior to each dose escalation.  The SRC 
charter will specify operational details pertaining to roles and responsibilities, data to be 
reviewed, review frequency, and reporting.

4.1. Inclusion Criteria 
Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for this study: 
1. Male and females, 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive, at time of Screening. 
a. Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be breastfeeding and must have no 
plans to become pregnant during the course of the study through 120 days after 
infusion of study drug.  Female subjects of childbearing potential who are 
heterosexual must agree to use 1 of the following methods of contraception 
considered to be highly effective (i.e., results in < 1% failure rate when used 
consistently and correctly) from Screening through 120 days after the last dose of 
study drug:  Intrauterine device or intrauterine system in place for at least 3 months prior to 
first dose. 
 Partner has had a vasectomy  4 months prior to participation.  Vasectomy in the 
partner is considered to be highly effective only if the partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the female subject of child-bearing potential and the vasectomy (as 
communicated to the subject by the vasectomized partner) was medically assessed 
as surgically successful.  Stable hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (including 
by not limited to approved oral, transdermal, or depot regimen) for at least 
3 months prior to first dose. 
b. Female subjects of non-childbearing potential must have evidence from their medical 
history indicating that they are not of childbearing potential and must not currently be 
breastfeeding.  Accepted evidence (self-reported medical history is acceptable) 
includes:  History of sterilization surgery , including tubal ligation, tubal occlusion, 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy. 
 Postmenopausal status (12 months with no menses and no alternative cause).  
Postmenopausal status will be confirmed with a follicle-stimulating hormone 
(FSH) test at Screening (FSH > 40 mIU/mL).  If there is any doubt about a female 
-menopausal status the subject must use a form of highly effective 
birth control as noted in Inclusion Criterion 1a. 
2. Any non-vasectomized male subjects must agree to use barrier contraceptives (male or 
female partner condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, sponges) plus spermicide for 200 days 
after dosing.  No restrictions are required for a vasectomized male provided his vasectomy 
was performed 4 months or more prior to study start.  A male who has been vasectomized 
less than 4 months prior to study start must follow the same restrictions as a non-
vasectomized male.  
3. Males must not donate sperm for at least 200 days after dosing.

5.1. Identification and Description of Study Drug 
5.1.1. PMN310 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.1.2. Placebo 
Placebo will consist of 100 mL 0.9% NaCl. 
5.2. Study Drug Preparation and Administration 
5.2.1. PMN310 
Study medication will be prepared at the study clinic by an unblinded pharmacist (or designee) 
IV drug for infusion will be dispensed to staff who will administer study drug.  Specific 
instructions for preparation and administration of study medication will be provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual. 
PMN310 will be administered as a single IV infusion over 60 minutes in 0.9% NaCl, adjusted to 
a total volume of 100 mL, followed by a 15 minute 0.9% NaCl flush.  The complete infusion will 
consist of the IV infusion and the flush following the IV infusion. 
The following dose level cohorts are planned to be evaluated: 175 mg (starting dose level), 
350 mg, 700 mg, 1400 mg, and 2800 mg (optional cohort).  The rationale for selecting these dose 
levels is provided in Section 1.4. 
5.2.2. Placebo 
Placebo will be administered as a matching single IV infusion over 60 minutes, followed by a 
15 minute 0.9% NaCl flush.  The complete infusion will consist of the IV infusion and the flush 
following the IV infusion. 
5.3. Randomization and Blinding 
Once an eligible subject is at the study site and prepared to receive the study drug, the subject 
will be assigned the treatment allocation according to the randomization sequence.  The 
randomization sequence will be obtained by computer-generated random numbers and provided 
to unblinded study site staff members who will have primary responsibility for drug dispensing.  
Within each cohort, eligible subjects will be randomized to receive PMN310 (N = 6) or placebo 
(N = 2).  Subjects and study personnel will be aware of the dosage level but will be blinded to

PMN310 ProMIS Neurosciences 
Confidential Page 29 the study drug administered (PMN310 or placebo).  Only unblinded study site staff members 
assigned to prepare study drug will know whether a subject receives PMN310 or placebo.  To 
maintain appropriate blinding, the unblinded pharmacist will consult the randomization 
acy staff will then 
provide prepared study drug in a blinded fashion to the Investigator (or designee) for infusion. 
5.4. Unblinding for an Individual Subject 
In case of an emergency, the Investigator has the sole responsibility of determining if unblinding 
rranted.  Blinding should only be broken in emergency situations 
when knowledge of the treatment assignment is required for the assurance of the safety of the 
subject and the medical management of the subject.  The Sponsor or representative should be 
contacted, when possible, before breaking the blind except in emergency circumstances when the 
Investigator has the sole responsibility for determining the need to unblind.  Upon breaking the 
blind, the reason must be documented, and the Sponsor should be immediately notified.  The 
applicable standard operating procedures (SOPs) will be followed for breaking the blind.  
5.5. Dose Escalation/Stopping Rules 
Dose escalation will be paused for review if any of the following occur, Two or more of the 
subjects in a cohort develop Grade 2 AEs in the same category.   
 One or more subjects in a cohort develop Grade  3 AEs. 
 It is determined that the limit of safety and/or tolerability has been reached as 
determined by the SRC.  
The Sponsor or SRC may pause and then stop dosing within a cohort or decide to not dose 
escalate to a higher dose if it is determined that any AE is occurring that is intolerable or poses a 
medically unacceptable safety risk. 
5.6. Storage, Handling, and Accountability of Study Drug 
PMN310 will be supplied directly to the study site.  The study site will acknowledge receipt of 
the shipment and record inventory and usage of study drug on a drug disposition form.  Upon 
arrival at the study site, vials will be stored frozen at -25ºC to -15ºC (-13°F to 5°F) inside the 
cartons to minimize exposure to light, with the cartons oriented such that the enclosed vials are 
in the upright position.  An unblinded study monitor will perform reconciliation of the drug 
product. 
Used vi 
Unused vials will be either destroyed at the study site or returned to the Sponsor, as agreed 
between the site and Sponsor.  Before disposal/destruction of unused vials, final drug 
accountability and reconciliation must be performed by the unblinded study monitor.  
Documentation of destruction of vials of PMN310 must be available for review by the study 
monitor.

The scheduled assessments for Screening, Inpatient, and Outpatient periods are summarized in 
Appendix 1 . 
For each study day described below, when multiple procedures are scheduled at the same 
nominal time relative to dosing, the following chronology of events should be adhered to, where 
possible: 
 Vital signs and ECGs will be obtained as close as possible to the scheduled time (up 
to 45 minutes before PK sampling), but before blood specimen collection. 
 Serum PK samples will be obtained at the scheduled time. 
 After venipuncture, PK samples will be obtained first followed by clinical safety 
laboratory tests. 
In the case of a clinical or laboratory abnormality, the Investigator may apply clinical judgement 
in repeating the measurement if the abnormality is believed likely to be an error. 
6.1. Screening Period (Day -28 to Day -1) 
Healthy volunteers will be recruited for this clinical study.  Before initiation of screening 
assessments, the subject must be given a complete explanation of the purpose and procedures 
occurring during the study.  Subsequently, the subject must sign and receive a copy of an 
Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved informed consent form (ICF) ( Section 11.4 ).  Once 
informed consent has been obtained, screening assessments will be performed and eligibility of 
the subject will be determined based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Subjects who fail 
screening may be rescreened following Sponsor approval. 
Study assessments are described in Section 7 .

Study assessments and procedures are to be performed on the schedule outlined in Appendix 1  
and listed by visit in Section 6 . 
Additional details for selected study procedures are provided in the sections below. 
7.1.1. Demography and Medical History 
Relevant medical conditions, concomitant illness, surgeries within the 6 months before 
Screening should be documented.  For female subjects, the last menstrual period should be 
recorded. 
7.1.2. Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
The C-SSRS is an interview with the subject that systematically evaluates suicidal ideation and 
behavior.  The C-SSRS (Baseline - Screening and Since Last Visit versions) will be performed 
by a qualified trained rater. 
At Screening, the C-SSRS will be used to exclude any candidate with a history of suicide 
have experienced suicidal ideation associated with actual intent or plan within 12 months of 
Screening, may have had a history of suicidal behavior within the past 5 years, or had any 
lifetime history of recurrent suicidal behavior, the candidate will be excluded from participation 
in the study. 
After Screening, the C-SSRS will be used to assess ideation and behavior at visits specified in 
Appendix 1.  stion, a suicidal 
risk assessment must be performed as soon as possible by a qualified mental health practitioner 
(with expertise in evaluation of suicidality) to determine whether it is safe for the subject to 
continue participation in the study. 
7.1.3. Physical Examination 
A full physical examination in this study will include the following: skin, eyes, ears, nose, oral 
mucosa, and throat, cardiac, respiratory, abdomen, and extremities.  
A symptom-directed physical examination will include both a full physical examination and a 
directed examination of the affected system related to any reported AE.  
Clinically relevant findings on the physical examination performed at Screening will be recorded 
as medical history.  Any clinically relevant treatment emergent new finding on examination will 
be documented as an AE. 
7.1.4. Neurological Exam 
Neurological examinations will include the following: mental status, level of consciousness, 
cranial nerve function, sensory function, motor function, and reflexes.

Confidential Page 43  All AEs (regardless of relationship to study drug) should be recorded from the time of 
informed consent through the follow-up visit at Week 12 (see Section 7.1.15.6 ).  
Complications that occur in association with any procedure should be recorded as 
AEs with assessed severity whether or not the procedure was protocol mandated. 
 In general, an abnormal diagnostic or laboratory value should not be recorded as an 
AE unless it is associated with clinical signs or symptoms (i.e., assessed as clinically 
significant), requires an intervention, results in an SAE, or results in study 
termination or interruption/discontinuation of study treatment.  When recording an 
AE resulting from a diagnostic or laboratory abnormality, the medical condition or 
diagnosis rather than the abnormality itself should be recorded (e.g.,  
7.1.15.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
In this study, an SAE is defined as an AE that meets any of the following criteria: 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening:  The term life-threatening in the definition of an SAE refers to an 
event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  The term life 
threatening does not refer to an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.   Requires hospitalization or a prolongation of an existing hospitalization:  In general, 
hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained at the hospital or 
emergency ward for observation or treatment that would not have been appropriate in ing.  Complications that occur during 
hospitalization are AEs, but not necessarily SAEs.  A medical occurrence or 
complication that prolongs hospitalization is an SAE.  When there is doubt as to 
whether hospitalization occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered an 
SAE.  Hospitalization for elective treatments of a preexisting condition that did not 
worsen from its original baseline level is not considered an SAE. 
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions:  This does not include AEs of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) that may interfere or prevent everyday 
life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
 A congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Other important medical event:  Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised 
when deciding whether reporting is appropriate for other important medical events 
that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization but still 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  These events should also be considered serious.  
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization or in the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

PMN310 ProMIS Neurosciences 
Confidential Page 44 An SAE requires additional detailed reports and follow-up (see Section 7.1.15.8 ).  The content of 
these detailed reports must address the I  The Medical Monitor 
will review the SAE to determine if it is an expected SAE (i.e., whether or not the SAE is 
identified in nature, severity, and frequency in the Investigator Brochure). 
7.1.15.2. Assessment of Adverse Event Severity 
The Investigator will assess the intensity of each AE and SAE reported during the study on the 
basis of his or her clinical judgement. 
The classifications in Table 1 should be used in assigning intensity of each AE recorded in the 
CRF. 
Table 1: Classification of Adverse Events by Intensity 
Intensity (Grade) Definition 
Mild AE (Grade 1) An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, 
causing minimal  discomfort and not interfering 
with everyday activities. 
Moderate AE  (Grade 2) Some interference with activity not requiring 
medical intervention 
Severe AE  (Grade 3)  Prevents daily activity and requires 
medical intervention 
 An event that, at the time of occurrence, 
put the subject at risk of death or resulted 
in a persistent or significant disability or 
incapacity.  
 An event that resulted in death.. 
AE = adverse event 
Any AE that changes in intensity or grade during a single occurrence of an AE will be recorded 
in the CRF at the highest level experienced by the subject. 
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  Severity is a category 
used for rating the intensity of an AE (such as mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction).  
An AE, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (e.g., a severe headache).  
Both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  An AE is considered serious when it meets 
criteria for one of the predefined outcomes described in Section 7.1.15.1 . 
7.1.15.3. Assessment of Causality 
The Investigator must estimate the relationship between study drug and the occurrence of each 
AE or SAE by using his or her best clinical judgment.  Elements to consider for this estimate 
include the history of the underlying disease, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the 
temporal relationship of the AE or SAE to exposure to study drug.  The Investigator must also  
Because of reporting timelines, the Investigator may have minimal information to include in the 
initial SAE report.  The Investigator, however, must always assess causality for every SAE 
before transmitting the SAE report.  The Investigator may change his or her opinion regarding      
 
 
 
       
PMN310-101 Version 2.0; 22 September 2023 
PMN310 ProMIS Neurosciences 
Confidential Page 45 causality in light of follow-up information, with subsequent amendment of the SAE report.  
Causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used to determine regulatory reporting requirements, and 
should not be left blank on the CRF.  The same applies to AEs that are to be processed as SAEs.  
The causal relationship of the study drug to an AE will be rated according to the following 
3-point scale:  
 Unlikely:  Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug 
administration; maenvironmental factors or other therapies administered  
 Possible:  Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration; 
 environmental factors or 
other therapies administered  
 Probable: Clear temporal association with improvement on cessation of study drug. 
Reappears upon re-challenge or follows a known pattern of response to the study drug  
For regulatory purposes, the following definitions will apply:  
 Related Adverse Event:  
 
 Unrelated Adverse Event: An unrelated AE is an AE with a causality rating of 
 
7.1.15.4. Assessment of Expectedness 
An unexpected adverse drug experience is defined as any adverse drug experience, that is not 
listed in the current Investigator Brochure.  This includes events that may be symptomatically 
and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the Investigator Brochure but differ from 
the event because of greater severity or specificity.  For example, under this definition, hepatic 
necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the Investigator Brochure only 
referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and 
cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the Investigator 
Brochure only listed cerebral vascular accidents.  The term unexpected, as used in this definition, 
refers to an adverse drug experience that has not been previously observed (i.e., included in the 
Investigator Brochure) rather than from the perspective of such experience not being anticipated 
from the pharmacological properties of the study drug. 
7.1.15.5. Procedures for Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events 
Investigator and study personnel will report all AEs and SAEs whether elicited during subject 
questioning, or discovered during physical examination, laboratory testing and/or other means 
and should be recorded on the CRF and/or SAE Report Form, as appropriate. 
7.1.15.5.1.  Eliciting Adverse Events 
An open-ended or non-directed method of questioning should be used at each study visit to elicit 
the reporting of AEs.

PMN310 ProMIS Neurosciences 
Confidential Page 46 7.1.15.5.2.  Recording Adverse Events 
The following information should be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF: 
 Description of the event using accepted medical terminology 
 Event onset and resolution dates 
 Whether the AE met serious criteria 
 Severity/grade 
 Relationship to study treatment or other causality 
 Outcome (final outcome) 
 Action taken with study drug 
7.1.15.5.3.  Diagnosis vs. Signs or Symptoms 
In general, the use of a unifying diagnosis is preferred to the listing out of individual symptoms 
(e.g., Dyspnea is a symptom of Pneumonia, therefore, record the reached diagnosis of 
Pneumonia as the event term when determined).  Grouping of symptoms into a diagnosis should 
only be done if each component sign and/or symptom is a medically confirmed component of a 
diagnosis as evidenced by standard medical practice.  If any aspect of a sign or symptom does 
not fit into a classic pattern of the diagnosis, report the individual symptom as a separate AE. 
7.1.15.6. Reporting Periods for Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
The safety reporting period for all AEs and SAEs is from the time of informed consent to the 
follow-up visit at Week 12.  All SAEs that occur after the safety reporting period and are 
considered study treatment-related in the opinion of the Investigator should also be reported to 
the Sponsor. 
Serious adverse events must be followed until significant changes return to baseline levels, the 
event stabilizes (recovering/resolving) or is no longer considered clinically significant by the 
Investigator, or the subject dies or withdraws consent.  All non-serious AEs will be followed 
through the follow-up visit at Week 12.  Certain non-serious AEs of interest should be followed 
until resolution, changes return to baseline levels, or study closure. 
7.1.15.7. Recording Serious Adverse Events 
For SAEs, record the event(s) on both the CRF and an SAE Report Form (paper or electronic).  It 
should be noted that SAEs that occur prior to initiation of study drug (e.g., due to a study 
protocol procedure) will be entered into the clinical database, but not entered into the safety 
database. 
The following should be considered when recording SAEs:  Death is an outcome of an event.  The event that resulted in the death should be 
recorded and reported on both an SAE Report Form and CRF. 
 For surgical or diagnostic procedures, the illness leading to the surgical or diagnostic 
procedure should be recorded as the SAE, not the procedure itself.  The procedure

illness. 
7.1.15.8. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
Any SAE occurring after the subject signs the ICF must be reported to pharmacovigilance staff 
by phone, fax, or e-mail within 24 hours of the time the Investigator becomes aware of the SAE 
(Table 2).  Any SAE reported by phone should be immediately followed up with the submission 
of the completed SAE Report Form (Table 2).  Urgent reporting of SAEs is required for the 
following reasons: 
1. To enable the Sponsor to fulfill the reporting requirements to the appropriate regulatory 
authority 
2. To facilitate discussion between the Sponsor and the Investigator about appropriate 
follow-up measures (if necessary) 
3. To facilitate the SInvestigators or sites in a multicenter study 
4. To facilitate reporting unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects to the IRB

The SAE report will be forwarded to pharmacovigilance staff within designated time frames.  If 
additional information to complete the SAE report is needed, the Investigator will not wait 
before notifying pharmacovigilance staff of the SAE.  The SAE report will be updated by the 
Investigator when additional information is received. 
7.1.15.9. Pregnancy 
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in either a female subject or female partner 
of a male subject are immediately reportable events.

must be reported to the study pharmacovigilance group immediately by email using the 
Pregnancy Reporting Form. 
The female subject may be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist or another appropriate 
healthcare professional for further evaluation. 
The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy and must 
notify immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (normal or abnormal outcome) by 
sending to the study pharmacovigilance group using the Pregnancy Follow-up Report Form. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (e.g., spontaneous abortion), the Investigator 
should report the abnormal outcome as an AE.  If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious 
criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to the study pharmacovigilance group within 24 hours of  
All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 30 days that the Investigator suspects is 
related to the in-utero exposure to the study drug should also be reported to the study  
Male subjects:  If a female partner of a male subject receiving study drug becomes pregnant, the 
male subject taking study drug should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female partner 
should be advised to call their healthcare provider immediately.

and specify all statistical methods to be used for analysis of the data. 
9.2. Determination of Sample Size 
A total of 40 subjects will be enrolled across 5 dose cohorts.  Cohort 5 is optional.  Each dose 
cohort will consist of 8 subjects (6 PMN310, 2 placebo).  The sample size of 8 subjects per 
cohort is based on feasibility and precedent for Phase 1 FIH studies.  The sample size of this 
study is not based on statistical considerations;  
 
 
9.3. Analyzed Population Sets 
 The safety population will include all subjects who receive study drug. 
 The PK population will include all subjects who receive study drug and have at least 
1 sample for PK analysis. 
 The evaluable population will include all subjects who complete at least 1 postdose 
LP. 
9.4. Statistical Analyses 
9.4.1. Safety Analysis 
Only subjects in the safety population will be included in the safety analysis.  Safety and 
tolerability results including vital signs, MRI if/when indicated, ECGs, laboratory test results, 
physical and neurological examinations, AEs/SAEs, serum ADA, and C-SSRS from this study 
will be assessed using summary statistics by cohort (e.g., n, mean, median, minimum, maximum, 
for continuous endpoints; n and percentages for binary and categorical endpoints).  All placebo 
subjects from the different cohorts will be combined into a single group for summary purposes. 
9.4.2. Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The PK population will be used for the PK analysis.  PMN310 serum concentration data will be 
listed by cohort, subject, and visit/sampling time point.  Descriptive summary statistics will be 
provided by cohort and visit/sampling time point.  Summary statistics will include mean 
(arithmetic and geometric), standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV) (arithmetic 
and geometric), median, minimum, and maximum.  Concentrations below lower limit of 
quantitation will be treated as zero in summary statistics.

IRB/IEC approval process, the protocol amendment will be submitted to the appropriate 
regulatory authority as an amendment to the regulatory submission under which the study is 
being conducted.  If a protocol amendment requires changes in the ICF, the revised ICF prepared 
by the Investigator also must be approved by the Sponsor, Medical Monitor, and the IRB/IEC 
before implementation. 
Departures from the protocol are allowed only in situations that eliminate an immediate risk to a 
subject and that are deemed crucial for the safety and wellbeing of that subject.  The Investigator 
or the attending physician also will contact the Medical Monitor as soon as possible in the case 
of such a departure.  These departures do not require preapproval by the IRB; however, the IRB 
and Medical Monitor must be notified in writing as soon as possible after the departure has been 
made.  In addition, the Investigator (for the protocol deviation and the ensuing events.

The IRB/IEC-approved ICF and Subject Information Sheet, if required, must be provided by the 
Sponsor.  The Investigator or designee must explain to the subject the purpose and nature of the 
study, the study procedures, the possible adverse effects, and all other elements of consent as 
defined in 21CFR Part 50 and other applicable national and local regulations governing ICF.   
Before the performance of any protocol-specific procedures that would not otherwise be done for 
a subject, a written and signed ICF must be obtained from the subject.  The form must be signed authorized representative if the subject is 
unable to sign.  A copy of the ICF must be provided to the subject.  If applicable, it can be 
provided in a certified translation into the local language.  Signed ICFs must remain in each  must be available for verification by the Medical Monitor or regulatory 
agencies at any time.  
In the United States, subjects must also sign a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act (HIPAA)-compliant authorization containing the mandated core elements and requirements 
prior to participating in a clinical study.

12.2. Retention of Study Records 
According to ICH E6, Section 4.9, all CRFs, as well as supporting paper and electronic source 
documentation and administrative records, must be retained by the Investigator until at least 
2 years after the last approval of a marketing application and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications, or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product in the United States.  
These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable 
regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the Sponsor.  The Sponsor is responsible for 
informing the Investigator and institution as to when these documents no longer need to be 
retained.  No study documents will be destroyed or moved to a new location without prior 
written approval from the Sponsor.  If the Investigator relocates, retires, or withdraws from the

If a urine pregnancy test is positive, a serum pregnancy test must be obtained.  Additional details provided in Section 7.1.9 . 
11 Pharmacokinetic blood sampling for serum PMN310 concentrations should be performed as follows: 
 Day 1: before infusion, at the end of infusion, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours after the end of infusion 
o Acceptable windows for PK sampling are as follows (exact time of PK collection is to be recorded):   
 Pre-dose sample to be collected within 60 minutes prior to dosing  
 0.5 to 4-hour post-dose samples to be collected ± 5 minutes  
 8 to 12-hour post-dose samples to be collected ± 10 minutes 
 Day 2 (24 and 36 hours) 
o Acceptable window for PK sampling is ± 30 minutes (exact time of PK collection is to be recorded) 
 Day 3 (48 hours) and Day 4 (72 hours) 
o Acceptable windows for PK sampling are ± 60 minutes (exact time of PK collection is to be recorded) 
 Days 8, 15, 29, 43, 57, 85 
12 Note: Residual or unused  serum and CSF samples will be stored for future use for the measurement of biomarkers.  For Day 120, only serum will be stored for 
the measurement of biomarkers since CSF will not be collected at Day 120.  Additional details are provided in Section 7.1.12 . 
13 CSF samples will be obtained via lumbar puncture (LP).  All dose cohorts will have LPs on Day 3 and Day 29.  The timing of additional LPs will be based on 
the available serum PK and CSF concentrations of PMN310 from prior cohorts, and may potentially include Day 15, Day 57, or Day 85 (shown in parentheses in the Schedule of Assessments).  The timing of LPs will be communicated to the Investigator who will inform the subject.  Coagulation (INR/PT/PTT and 
platelet) results within 2 days prior to the LP must be confirmed and determined to be within normal range before LP.  No subject will have more than 3 total 
LPs.  Post LP, subjects will remain supine for a minimum of 4 hours, and may be kept longer for observation at the discretion of the Investigator.  After the 4-
hour observation period, safety and tolerability will be assessed and subjects will be discharged home. 
14 AE assessment of protocol-related procedures will be performed after informed consent is obtained.  
15 Following completion of the postdose outpatient follow-up period, subjects may return for an optional follow-up visit, if warranted by previous data.  The 
decision to recommend the optional follow-up visit will be made by the Sponsor and communicated to the Investigator who will notify the subject about the 
timing of the optional visit.  Additional details are provided in Section 6.2.3 .

Document History
Document Version Date Summary and Rationale for Changes
Protocol amendment 5 08 March 2022 •Enrollment of study participants was 
terminated with fewer study participants enrolled than originally planned due to enrollment challenges into a placebo-controlled trial as a result of universal recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination of pregnant women and the increased global availability of COVID-19 vaccines.
•Modified the primary immunogenicity 
objectives and estimands from 
hypothesis testing analysis to descriptive analysis as a result of the significantly reduced final number of study participants enrolled than originally planned.
•Modified an exploratory 
immunogenicity estimand by removing 
the calculation of incidence rate after 1 month after delivery for crossover participants because there is no COVID-19 surveillance for these participants after 1 month after delivery.
•Modified appropriate statistical sections 
due to updates to the primary immunogenicity objectives and estimands.
•Updated Sections 2.2.1 and 2.3to reflect 
current recommendations and to provide details of the recent safety and efficacy analysis results for study C4591001.
Protocol amendment 4 06 August 2021 •Added procedures in Section 8.14 to 
capture data pertaining to myocarditis and pericarditis in response to commitments made to CBER.

Document Version Date Summary and Rationale for Changes
•Added myocarditis and pericarditis in 
Sections 8.14 and 2.3.1 in response to commitments made to CBER.
•Added a procedure to any visit that 
occurs sooner than 1 month after any 
vaccination in Sections 8.11 and 8.17 in response to commitments made to CBER.
•Added myocarditis and pericarditis as 
AESIs in Section 8.3.8.
•Added a statement on diversity in 
Section 5.
•Added clarification to the infant SoA 
(Section 1.3.3) to collect the e-diary or assist the maternal participant to delete the application at Visit 3.
•Administrative update in 
Section 8.11.1.7 to add collection of the e-diary or assist the participant to delete the application.
•Corrected typographical errors 
throughout.
Protocol amendment 3 14 May 2021 •Reduced the study sample size based on 
regulatory feedback and evolving global 
availability of COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.
•Modified the study objectives to align 
with the reduced sample size.
•Removed the hypothesis-based efficacy 
objective, estimands, and endpoints.
•Modified the statistical analysis timing 
to align with the reduced sample size and changes in the objectives.

Page 4Document History
Document Version Date Summary and Rationale for Changes
•Updated a typographical error in the 
SoA regarding the need to collect AE information during the 1-week postdelivery follow-up call.
•Clarified that, if pregnancy outcome 
information was not obtained at the time 
of delivery, updated information should be provided at Visit 6.
•Added a modifier to inclusion 
criterion 8 regarding the need for a telephone as method of contact in Mozambique, so that the population is reachable based on location despite lack of routine access to telephones.
•Removed the collection of CD4 count 
and HIV viral load at Visit 101 in Sections 1.3.2 and 8.17.1 since this is duplicate information and will already be collected at Visit 7 in Section 1.3.1.
•Added “chills” to the definition of 
confirmed COVID-19 in maternal participants in Section 8.1.1.
Protocol amendment 2 02 March 2021 •Sections 1.3.1 and 1.3.2: expanded the 
1-month postdelivery visit window by 1 week to allow for potential earlier vaccination of BNT162b2 to participants originally randomized to receive placebo.
•Section 1.3.3: removed “equivalent visit 
number for maternal participants” from the Infant SoA since this will differ for maternal participants originally randomized to placebo who will go on to receive BNT162b2 at 1 month after delivery and follow a different SoA.
•Section 2.3: added a sentence to clarify 
that the protocol is a PASS.

Document Version Date Summary and Rationale for Changes
•Section 5.1.1: corrected the calculation 
of GA in the third trimester, replacing “second trimester” with “third trimester,” and updated the discrepancy of days between the LMP-determined GA from >10 to >21 days.
•Removed references to 
thumbprinting the ICD, since 
illiterate participants will not be enrolled from certain regions.
•Clarified in Section 8.2.2 that field 
workers would be used in the case of poor network connection for e-diary completion.
•Sections 5.1.1, 8.17.3, and 10.4: added 
criteria for inclusion of maternal participants with stable HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C in Phase 3.
•Updated the Objectives, Estimands, and 
Endpoints to add a safety objective for the first 600 randomized maternal participants to support interim analysis/submission report.
•Per CBER feedback, updated the 
term “NI” to “immunobridging” todescribe the immunogenicity comparison between nonrandomized populations in the protocol.
•Added a footnote to clarify that 
HIV-infected participants will not be included in analyses of the objectives. Analyses among HIV-infected women and their infants will be summarized separately.

Page 6•Sections 8.1.1 and 8.13.1: added a 
second definition of symptoms of severe COVID-19 disease per the CDC definition.
•Section 8.2.3: clarified that stopping 
rules are in place during Phase 2 only, with no overlap into Phase 3.
•Clarified that a study pause may not 
prevent administration of Dose 2 for enrolled participants.
•Modified stopping rule 7 to include 
a trigger of preterm premature 
rupture of membranes.
•Stopping rule 4: removed 
assessment of laboratory abnormalities, as these data are not collected in this study.
•Section 8.11.1, Visit 1: removed the 
requirement of a repeat fetal scan to clarify that an earlier scan done 
at≥18 weeks瀠GA can be used to 
confirm singleton pregnancy and rule 
out fetal anomalies.
•Section 8.16: clarified that exclusion 
criterion 2 is not met if the participant meets the criteria for confirmed COVID-19 with or without symptoms and can receive Vaccination 2.
•Section 8.17: to align with current 
recommendations, investigators may 
exercise judgment on review of inclusion and exclusion criteria ahead of vaccination with BNT162b2 for participants who originally received placebo.
•Sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.7: inserted 
language to clarify that potential COVID-19/MIS-C illnesses and their sequelae that are consistent with the clinical endpoint definition should not 
be recorded as AEs.

1.1. SynopsisShort Title: A Phase 2/3 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a 
SARS-CoV-2 RNA Vaccine Candidate (BNT162b2) Against COVID-19 in Healthy Pregnant Women 18 Years of Age and Older
RationaleIn December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, China.  
In January 2020, it became clear that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was the underlying cause.  Later in January, the genetic sequence of the 2019-nCoV became available to the WHO and public (MN908947.3), and the virus was categorized in the Betacoronavirus
subfamily.  By sequence analysis, the phylogenetic tree revealed a closer relationship to SARS virus isolates than to another coronavirus infecting humans, the MERS virus. SARS-CoV-2 infections and the resulting disease, COVID-19, have spread globally, affecting a growing number of countries.
On 11 March 2020, the WHO characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic.  Global 
case rates and deaths have continued to increase, with the United States reporting the mostcases and deaths of any other country.  At the time of this communication, the number of confirmed cases continues to rise globally.  There are currently no licensed vaccines or effective antiviral drugs to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections or the disease it causes, COVID-19.
Pregnant women are at risk for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Pregnancy 
may confer increased risk of severe COVID-19 because of physiological changes during pregnancy that can increase susceptibility to respiratory infections and subsequent rapid progression to respiratory failure. Additionally, pregnant women with COVID-19 have been reported to have higher rates of preterm birth, cesarean delivery, fetal distress, and infants requiring neonatal intensive care. Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 is critically important in pregnant women.
Given the rapid transmission of COVID-19 and incidence of disease in the United States and 
elsewhere, the rapid development of an effective vaccine is of utmost importance.
BNT162b2 is a SARS-CoV-2–RNA-LNP vaccine based on a platform of modRNA with 
blunted innate immune sensor–activating capacity and augmented expression encoding the
P2 S.
This study will describe the safety of BNT162b2 in pregnant women and their infants. It will 
also assess the immunogenicity of BNT162b2 in pregnant women, the transfer of antibody to their infants, and the kinetics of antibody transfer in the infant.

Overall Design
This will be a global Phase 2/3, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study 
evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 30 μg of BNT162b2 or placebo 
administered in 2 doses, 21 days apart, in approximately 350 healthy pregnant women 18 years of age or older vaccinated at 24 to 34 weeks’ gestation. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive BNT162b2 or placebo (saline).

Page 21The Phase 2 portion of the study will include approximately 200 pregnant women
randomized 1:1 to receive BNT162b2 or placebo (saline) at 27 to 34 weeks’ gestation. The IRC will review safety data through 7 days after the second dose for all Phase 2 participants.
The Phase 3 portion of this study will assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 
BNT162b2 among pregnant women enrolled at 24 to 34 weeks’ gestation. Phase 3 will proceed after the first 200 maternal participants have been enrolled in Phase 2.
Maternal participants who originally received placebo will receive BNT162b2 at defined 
time points as part of the study.
Number of ParticipantsApproximately 200 healthy pregnant women will be enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of the 
study. Approximately 150 healthy pregnant women will be enrolled in the Phase 3 portion.
Intervention Groups and DurationThis study will evaluate a 2-dose (separated by 21 days) schedule of 30 μg of the 
investigational BNT162b2 RNA vaccine candidate (BNT162 RNA-LNP vaccine utilizing modRNA and encoding the P2 S) for active immunization against COVID-19.
Healthy pregnant women will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a 2-dose schedule of 
either:
•BNT162b2 (BNT162 RNA-LNP vaccine utilizing modRNA and encoding the P2 S) at a 
dose of 30 μg OR
•Normal saline solution for injection (0.9% NaCl injection).
Each maternal participant will participate in the study for approximately up to 10 months 
depending on the vaccine group to which she was randomized. Her infant will participate in the study for approximately 6 months. The study duration will be approximately 14 months.
Data Monitoring Committee or Other Independent Oversight CommitteeThe study will utilize an IRC, an internal Pfizer committee that will be used during the 
Phase 2 portion of the study to closely monitor safety.
The study will include stopping rules, which may result in a pause to study vaccination 
followed by a review and recommendation by the IRC.
The study will use an external DMC to monitor vaccine safety throughout the study.

Page 22Statistical Methods
The primary safety objective will be evaluated by descriptive summary statistics for local 
reactions, systemic events, AEs, and SAEs, for each vaccine group.  Descriptive summary statistics will include counts and percentages of participants with the indicated endpoint and the associated Clopper-Pearson 95% CIs. A 3-tier approach will be used to summarize AEs.The AEs, including SAEs, reported in the open-label follow-up period will be summarized separately from those reported during the blinded follow-up period for maternal participants. The safety objective related to infants born to maternal participants, including birth outcomes, AEs, SAEs, and AESIs, will be evaluated in a similar way.
There are 2 primary immunogenicity objectives, one for participants without evidence of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, and the other for participants with and without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection; each will be evaluated by describing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers induced by BN T162b2 at 1 month after Dose 2 in maternal 
participants and in a group of randomly selected nonpregnant women within the same age group from the C4591001 study. GMRs will be provided along with associated 2-sided 95% CIs.
Other immunogenicity objectives will be evaluated descriptively by GMTs/GMCs and 
GMFRs of full-length S-binding IgG levels and/or SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers and associated 2-sided 95% CIs.
The secondary efficacy objectives are to describe VE against the confirmed COVID-19 
illness during the blinded follow-up period, which is defined as VE = 100 × (1 – IRR). IRR is calculated as the ratio of first confirmed COVID-19 illness rate in the vaccine group to the corresponding illness rate in the placebo group.
VE against asymptomatic infection will be evaluated descriptively, in a similar way.The incidence rates of confirmed COVID-19 and asymptomatic infection per 
1000 person-years of follow-up in maternal participants after their receipt of BNT162b2 throughout the study will be provided with the associated 2-sided 95% CIs.
The incidence rate of confirmed COVID-19 and incidence rate of confirmed MIS-C in infant
participants, and associated 2-sided 95% CIs, will also be provided according to the vaccine group to which the maternal participants were randomized.

Page 302. INTRODUCTION
The BNT162b2 RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine is currently being investigated for 
prevention of COVID-19 in healthy pregnant women.
2.1. Study Rationale
The purpose of the study is to describe the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 
BNT162b2 RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine against COVID-19 in healthy pregnant women.  There are currently no licensed vaccines to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19.  Pregnant women are at risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection, developing COVID-19 and COVID-19–associated complications. Given the global crisis of COVID-19 and fast expansion of the disease globally, the rapid development of an effective vaccine for use in this population is of utmost importance.
2.2. Background
In December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, China.  
In January 2020, it became clear that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was the underlying cause.  Later in January, the genetic sequence of the 2019-nCoV became available to the WHO and public (MN908947.3), and the virus was categorized in the Betacoronavirus
subfamily.  By sequence analysis, the phylogenetic tree revealed a closer relationship to SARS virus isolates than to another coronavirus infecting humans, the MERS virus.
1,2
SARS-CoV-2 infections and the resulting disease, COVID-19, have spread globally, 
affecting a growing number of countries, and on 11 March 2020, the WHO characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic.
3  On 16 December 2020, The Center for Systems 
Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University reported more than 73 million cases globally, with over 1.6 million deaths from 191 countries. Global case rates and deaths have continued to increase, with the United States reporting the most cases and deaths of any other country.  There are currently no vaccines broadly available to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections or the disease it causes, COVID-19.
4
Pregnant women are at risk for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19.5,6,7
Pregnancy may confer increased risk of severe COVID-19 because of physiological changes 
during pregnancy that can increase susceptibility to respiratory infections and subsequent rapid progression to respiratory failure.
8Additionally, pregnant women with COVID-19 
have been reported to have higher rates of preterm birth, cesarean delivery, fetal distress, and 
infants requiring neonatal intensive care.8,9,10,11While COVID-19 in children is reported less 
commonly than in adults, infants <1 year of age, if infected with SARS-CoV-2, may be atincreased risk of severe disease, and younger age groups have increasing rates of COVID-19–associated hospitalization.
12,13Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
COVID-19 is critically important in pregnant women, and maternal immunization may confer some protection to their infants.

Page 31Given the rapid transmission of COVID-19 and incidence of disease in the United States and 
elsewhere, the rapid development of an effective vaccine is of utmost importance.
A prophylactic, RNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine provides one of the most flexible and 
fastest approaches available to immunize against the emerging virus.14,15The development 
of an RNA-based vaccine encoding a viral antigen, which is then expressed by the vaccine recipient as a protein capable of eliciting protective immune responses, provides significant advantages over more traditional vaccine approaches.  Unlike live attenuated vaccines, RNA vaccines do not carry the risks associated with infection and may be given to people who cannot be administered live virus (eg, pregnant women and immunocompromised persons).  RNA-based vaccines are manufactured via a cell-free in vitro transcription process, which allows an easy and rapid production and the prospect of producing high numbers of vaccination doses within a shorter time period than achieved with traditional vaccine approaches.  This capability is pivotal to enable the most effective response in outbreak scenarios.
14,15
There are no ongoing randomized controlled COVID-19 vaccine studies including pregnant
women. Vaccination of pregnant women has been used globally to protect both women and their infants against influenza and as a mechanism to protect infants against pertussis.Several studies have demonstrated that maternal immunization is safe for both mother and infant and an important strategy to protect pregnant women and their infants against infectious diseases.  Currently maternal immunization studies are being conducted as part of the development of novel RSV and GBS vaccines.
16,17
BNT162b2 is a SARS-CoV-2–RNA-LNP vaccine based on a platform of modRNA with 
blunted innate immune sensor–activating capacity and augmented expression encoding the P2 S.
This study will describe the safety of BNT162b2 in pregnant women and their infants. It will 
also assess the immunogenicity of BNT162b2 in pregnant women, the transfer of antibody to their infants, and the kinetics of antibody transfer in the infant.
2.2.1. Clinical Overview
Prior to this study, clinical data from BNT162b2 established a favorable safety profile 
characterized by mild, localized, and transient effects. Study C4591001 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is 
an ongoing Phase 1/2/3 trial in ~46,000 participants designed to generate safety, tolerability, 
immunogenicity, and efficacy data from a novel RNA-based vaccine candidate.
18  The trial is 
being conducted in a heterogeneous study population: eligible healthy participants ≥12 years 
of age, including those participants with stable chronic medical conditions, including HIV-, HCV-, and HBV-positive participants.  The study consists of 2 parts: Phase 1: to identify the preferred vaccine candidate (BNT162b1 or BNT162b2) and dose level (10 μg, 20 μg, 30 μg, 
or 100 μg [for BNT162b1]); Phase 2/3: an expanded-cohort and efficacy part for the selected 
vaccine candidate (BNT162b2).

Page 32The available immunogenicity data from Phase 1 participants show that BNT162b2 induced 
a robust IgG-binding response to S1 and a SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing response.  Immunogenicity substantially increased following the second dose of vaccine.  BNT162b2 induces a strong antigen-specific Th1-skewed CD4+ response and a strong antigen-specific CD8+ response.  BNT162b2 was selected from the Phase 1 part of the study based on theoverall safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity.  In a mid-November 2020 analysis of 36,621 participants randomized 1:1 to vaccine or placebo, who were included in the per-protocol efficacy analysis population of pa rticipants without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 
infection prior to 7 days after completion of the vaccination schedule, the efficacy in preventing confirmed COVID-19 occurring at least 7 days after the second dose of vaccine was 95.0%, with 8 COVID-19 cases in the active vaccine group and 162 COVID-19 cases in the placebo group.  Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point estimates across age groups, sexes, racial and ethnic groups, and participants with medical comorbidities associated with high risk of severe COVID-19.  Secondary efficacy analyses suggested benefit of the vaccine in preventing severe COVID-19, in preventing COVID-19 following the first dose, and in preventing COVID-19 in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, although available data for these outcomes did not allow for firm conclusions.
19
In a subsequent analysis of 927 confirmed symptomatic cases of COVID-19, an efficacy rate of 91.3% was observed for BNT162b2 in preventing such cases occurring between 7 days to 6 months after the second dose.
20Furthermore, from the same analysis, BNT162b2 was 
shown to have an efficacy of:
•100% in preventing severe disease as defined by the CDC.
•95.3% in preventing severe disease as defined by the FDA.
•100% in preventing COVID-19 cases in South Africa, where the B.1.351 lineage is 
prevalent.
Safety data from approximately 38,000 participants at least 16 years of age randomized 1:1
to vaccine or placebo with a median of 2 months of follow-up after the second dose demonstrated a favorable safety profile.  Available safety data from all participants enrolled through the 14 November 2020 data cutoff (N = 43,252, which includes late enrollment of additional adolescent and adult participants) were consistent with the safety profile for the approximately 38,000 participants with a median follow-up of 2 months and also did not raise specific safety concerns.

Page 33The most common solicited adverse reactions were injection site reactions (84.1%), 
fatigue (62.9%), headache (55.1%), muscle pain (38.3%), chills (31.9%), joint pain (23.6%), and fever (14.2%); severe adverse reactions occurred in 0.0% to 4.6% of participants, were more frequent after Dose 2 than after Dose 1, and were generally less frequent in participants ≥55 years of age ( ≤2.8%) as compared to younger participants ( ≤4.6%).  The 
frequency of SAEs was low ( <0.5%), without meaningful imbalances between study arms. 
Lymphadenopathy was observed in 0.3% of vaccine recipients as compared to <0.1% of 
those who received placebo.  Otherwise, there were no notable patterns or numerical imbalances between vaccine groups for specific categories of nonserious AEs (including other neurologic, neuroinflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to BNT162b2.  With the exception of more frequent, generally mild to moderate 
reactogenicity in participants <55 years of age, the safety profile of BNT162b2 was generally 
similar across age groups, sexes, ethnic and racial groups, participants with or without medical comorbidities, and participants with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at enrollment.
19
Numerous COVID-19 vaccines are currently in development globally, and several candidate COVID-19 vaccines (eg, mRNA vaccines and adenovirus-vectored vaccines expressing the S protein) have been shown to be efficacious in the prevention of COVID-19 in clinical studies and are now available under temporary or emergency authorizations.
21BNT162b2, 
an RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine given as a 2-dose series administered 21 days apart, was shown to be safe and effective in a Phase 1/2/3 study and has received authorizations for temporary or emergency use or marketing authorizations in multiple countries and has been fully licensed for use in individuals 16 years of age and above in the US as of23 August 2021.
22,23
On 22 September 2021, based on safety and immunogenicity data from approximately 
300 immunocompetent adult booster-dose recipients from Study C4591001, the FDA issued the EUA for a single booster dose of BNT162b2 30 μg for 1) individuals 65 years of age and 
older; 2) individuals 18 through 64 years of age at high risk of severe COVID-19; and 3) individuals 18 through 64 years of age whose frequent institutional or occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 puts them at high risk of serious complications of COVID-19, including severe COVID-19.
24  On 19 November 2021, the FDA amended the EUA, 
authorizing use of a single booster dose for all individuals 18 years of age and older after completion of primary vaccination with an FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine.
25On 
09 December 2021, the FDA again amended the EUA to authorize the use of a single booster dose for administration to individuals 16 and 17 years of age at least 6 months after completion of primary vaccination with BNT162b2.
26  In addition, a booster dose of the 
vaccine is authorized in the EU and other countries, with recommendations for populations varying based on local health authority guidance.

Page 342.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment
There is an ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19, however, numerous COVID-19 
vaccines are currently in development globally, and several candidate COVID-19 vaccines 
(eg, mRNA vaccines and adenovirus-vectored vaccines expressing the S protein) have been 
shown to be efficacious in the prevention of COVID-19 in clinical studies and are now 
available under temporary or emergency authorizations or have licenses or conditional 
marketing authorizations . While there were no data available from clinical trials on the use 
of BNT162 vaccines in pregnant women, preliminary data are available from the ongoingPhase 1/2/3 clinical trial evaluating the use of BNT162b2 30- μg doses administered 21 days 
apart in nonpregnant adults.
In the C4591001 study, BNT162b2 has been shown to elicit increased local and systemic 
adverse reactions as compared to those in the placebo arm, usually lasting a few days.  The most common solicited adverse reactions were injection site reactions (84.1%), fatigue (62.9%), headache (55.1%), muscle pain (38.3%), chills (31.9%), joint pain (23.6%), and fever (14.2%).
19Adverse reactions characterized as reactogenicity were generally mild 
to moderate.  The number of participants reporting hypersensitivity-related AEs was numerically higher in the vaccine group compared with the placebo group (137 [0.63%] vs 111 [0.51%]).  Severe adverse reactions occurred in 0.0% to 4.6% of participants, were more frequent after Dose 2 than after Dose 1, and were generally less frequent in older adults 
(>55 years of age) ( ≤2.8%) as compared to younger participants ( ≤4.6%).  Among reported 
unsolicited AEs, lymphadenopathy occurred much more frequently in the active vaccine group than the placebo group and is plausibly related to vaccination.  SAEs, while 
uncommon ( <1.0%), represented medical events that occur in the general population at 
similar frequency as observed in the study.
19
No specific safety concerns were identified in subgroup analyses by age, race, ethnicity, medical comorbidities, or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.  The risks are based on the observed safety profile to date, which shows mostly mild reactogenicity, low incidence of severe or serious events, and no clinically concerning safety observations.  The preponderance of severe cases of COVID-19 in the placebo group relative to the BNT162b2 group (9 of 10) suggests no evidence of VAED.
19
In the latest analysis from C4591001, vaccine safety has been evaluated in more than 44,000 participants ≥16 years of age, with more than 12,000 vaccinated participants having at 
least 6 months follow-up after their second dose.  No serious safety concerns have been observed in this timeframe.  Side effects observed in this analysis were generally consistent with previously reported results.
20
Continued clinical investigation is justified, given:
•the threat posed by the increasing number of globally distributed outbreaks of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Page 35•the potential of the BioNTech platform of RNA-based vaccines to deliver high numbers 
of vaccine doses rapidly in a single production campaign.
•the threat posed by the SARS-CoV-2 variants emerging worldwide.
•the potential need for enhancing immunoresponses to overcome waning immunity.
These data suggest a favorable risk/benefit profile in pregnant women.  Anticipated AEs after 
vaccination in maternal participants are expected to be manageable using routine symptom-driven standard of care as determined by the investigators. As a result, the profile of these vaccine candidates supported initiation of this PASS clinical study. This interventional study is designated as a PASS, identified as Category 3 in the EU RMP, and is conducted as a conditional marketing approval commitment to the EMA and Swissmedic and an emergency use authorization commitment to the US FDA and numerous other health authorities under respective national emergency use legislation.
DART studies have been completed. In summary, administration of BNT162b2 to female 
rats twice before the start of mating and twice during gestation at the human clinical dose was associated with nonadverse effects (body weight, food consumption, and effects localized to the injection site) after each dose administration. However, there were no effects of BNT162b2 administration on mating performance, fertility, or any ovarian or uterine parameters in the female rats or on embryo-fetal or postnatal survival, growth, or development in the offspring. An immune response was confirmed in female rats following administration of each vaccine candidate and these responses were also detectable in the offspring (fetuses and pups). Additional details are included in the IB.
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected AEs of BNT162b2 may be found in the IB, which is the SRSD for this study.

•Monitoring for cases of COVID-19 developing 
during the study will be reported.
Potential for adverse obstetric and/or neonatal outcomes following vaccination.There are no ongoing COVID-19 vaccine studies 
including pregnant women and, therefore, the 
potential for adverse obstetric and/or neonatal 
outcomes following vaccination while pregnant is unknown.•Stopping rules for obstetric and neonatal AEs 
occurring after study vaccination and/or 
possibly deemed related to study vaccination in 
the Phase 2 portion of the trial. If a stopping rule is triggered, a pause of study vaccinationwill be put in place until there is a review of all relevant safety events and evaluation by the IRC.
Very rare cases of anaphylaxis, myocarditis, and 
pericarditis have been reported after authorization in 
recipients of BNT162b2.Anaphylaxis: The estimated rate is 5.0 per million 
doses administered.
Myocarditis and pericarditis: Very rare cases 
of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported following vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Typically, the cases have occurred more often in younger men and 
after the second dose of the vaccine and within 
14 days after vaccination. These are generally mild cases, and individuals tend to recover within a short time following standard treatment and rest.  •Specific reference to these risks is made within 
the ICD, with instruction to contact a 
healthcare professional if a case is suspected.
•For anaphylaxis, there is an on-site 30-minute 
observation period after vaccination.
•Instructions for handling suspected cases of 
myocarditis and pericarditis are found in

4. STUDY DESIGN
4.1. Overall DesignThis will be a global Phase 2/3, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study in 
approximately 350 healthy pregnant women 18 years of age or older vaccinated during their 24 to 34 weeks’ gestation. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 2 doses of BNT162b2 or placebo administered 21 days apart.  The Phase 2 portion of the study will include approximately 200 pregnant women randomized 1:1 to receive BNT162b2 or placebo (saline) during their 27 to 34 weeks’ gestation. Safety datathrough 7 days after the second dose (where Day 1 is the day of vaccination) for all Phase 2 participants will be reviewed by the Pfizer IRC. The Phase 3 portion of this study will assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of BNT162b2 in approximately 150 pregnant women enrolled during their 24 to 34 weeks’ gestation who will be randomized in a 1:1 ratioto receive BNT162b2 or placebo (saline).  Phase 3 will proceed after the first 200 maternalparticipants have been enrolled in Phase 2. Maternal participants who originally received placebo will receive BNT162b2 at defined time points as part of the study.

Page 44Enrollment in this study was terminated on 25 Oct 2021 with approximately 350 participants 
enrolled.  Enrollment was terminated due to enrollment challenges into a placebo-controlled study as a result of universal recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination of pregnant women and the increased global availability of COVID-19 vaccines. Enrollment numbers within this protocol have been modified accordingly.
The study is observer-blinded, as the physical appearance of the investigational vaccine and 
the placebo may differ. The participant, investigator, study coordinator, and other site staff will be blinded through the 1-month postdelivery visit for each maternal participant.  At the study site, only the dispenser(s)/administrator(s) are unblinded.
Each maternal participant will participate in the study for approximately up to 10 months
depending on the vaccine group to which she was randomized. Her infant will participate in the study for approximately 6 months. The study duration will be approximately 14 months.
For each placebo recipient who will go on to receive BNT162b2 and follow a new visit 
schedule ( Section 1.3.2 ), she will participate in the study for up to 7 months, and her infant 
will participate in the study for approximately 6 months.
The study will use an external DMC throughout study conduct. A Pfizer IRC will be used 
during the Phase 2 portion of the study to closely monitor safety.
The study will include stopping rules, which may result in a pause to study vaccination 
followed by a review and recommendation by the IRC.
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design
There are currently no licensed vaccines to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 or 
COVID-19.  Pregnant women are at risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection, developing COVID-19 and COVID-19–associated complications. Given the global crisis of COVID-19 and fast expansion of the disease globally, the rapid development of an effective vaccine for use in this population is of utmost importance.
This study is being conducted as a standard maternal immunization safety and 
immunogenicity clinical trial; however, additional surveillance for COVID-19 has been included as part of the study to assess efficacy (based on a minimal number of cases) as well as to monitor the potential risk of disease enhancement and severe disease in pregnant women and their infants with COVID-19.  If a participant experiences symptoms, as detailed 
in Section 8.13 , a COVID-19 illness and subsequent convalescent visit will occur.  As part of 
these visits, samples (nasal swab and blood) will be taken for antigen and antibody assessment as well as recording of COVID-19–related clinical and laboratory information (including local diagnosis).
4.3. Justification for Dose
Based on data from the Phase 1 component of clinical trial C4591001, the BNT162b2 
vaccine candidate was selected at a dose of 30 μg for Phase 2/3 evaluation in C4591001.

Study intervention administration details will be recorded on the CRF.6.2. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
1. The investigator or designee must confirm that appropriate temperature conditions have 
been maintained during transit for all study interventions received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study intervention.
2. Only maternal participants enrolled in the study may receive study intervention and only 
authorized site staff may supply or administer study intervention.  All study interventionsmust be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated recording) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff.  At a minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations must be documented and available upon request.  Data for nonworking days must indicate the minimum and maximum temperatures since previously documented for all site storage locations upon return to business.
3. Any excursions from the study intervention label storage conditions should be reported to 
Pfizer upon discovery along with any actions taken.  The site should actively pursue options for returning the study intervention to the storage conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible.  Once an excursion is identified, the study intervention must be quarantined and not used until Pfizer provides permission to use the study intervention.  Specific details regarding the definition of an excursion and information the site should report for each excursion will be provided to the site in the IP manual.
4. Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD will be superseded by the storage conditions 
stated on the label.
5. Study interventions should be stored in their original containers.6. See the IP manual for storage conditions of the study intervention.7. The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance 
(ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records), such as the IPAL or sponsor-approved equivalent. All study interventions will be accounted for using a study intervention accountability form/record.

Upon identification of a product complaint, notify the sponsor within 1 business day of 
discovery as described in the IP manual.
6.2.1. Preparation and Dispensing
See the IP manual for instructions on how to prepare the study intervention for 
administration.  Study intervention should be prepared and dispensed by an appropriately qualified and experienced member of the study staff (eg, physician, nurse, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, pharmacy assistant/technician, or pharmacist) as allowed by local, state, and institutional guidance.  A second staff member will verify the dispensing.
Study intervention and placebo will be prepared by qualified unblinded site personnel 
according to the IP manual.  The study intervention will be administered in such a way as to ensure that the maternal participants remain blinded.
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
6.3.1. Allocation to Study InterventionMaternal participants will be allocated (randomized) to a vaccine group as described below. 
The infants of the maternal participants will be assigned a participant number at birth.
Allocation of maternal participants to vaccine groups will proceed through the use of an IRT 
system (IWR).  The site personnel (study coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or select information including but not limited to the user’s ID and password, the protocol number, and the maternal participant number.  The site personnel will then be provided with a vaccine assignment, randomization number, and DU or container number when study intervention is being supplied via the IRT system. The IRT system will provide a confirmation report containing the maternal participant number, randomization number, and DU or container number assigned.  The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files.
Study intervention will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in the SoA.
The study-specific IRT reference manual and IP manual will provide the contact information 
and further details on the use of the IRT system.
Maternal participants will be assigned to receive study intervention according to 
randomization scheme.  Investigators will remain blinded to each maternal participant’s assigned study intervention until 1 month after delivery.

Page 556.3.2. Blinding of Site Personnel Until the 1-Month Postdelivery Visit
In this observer-blinded study, the study staff receiving, storing, dispensing, preparing, and 
administering the study interventions will be unblinded.  All other study and site personnel, including the investigator, investigator staff, and maternal participants, will be blinded to study intervention assignments.  In particular, the individuals who evaluate maternal participant safety will be blinded.  Because the BNT162 RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate and placebo are different in physical appearance, the study intervention syringes will be administered in a manner that prevents the maternal study participants from identifying the study intervention type based on its appearance.
The responsibility of the unblinded dispenser and administrator must be assigned to an 
individual or individuals who will not participate in the evaluation of any maternal study participants.  Contact between the unblinded dispenser and maternal study participants and unblinded administrator and maternal study participants should be kept to a minimum.  The remaining site personnel must not know study intervention assignments.
In the event of a Quality Assurance audit, the auditor(s) will be allowed access to unblinded 
study intervention records at the site(s) to verify that randomization/dispensing has been done accurately.
To allow administration of BNT162b2 to maternal participants who originally received 
placebo, site staff will be unblinded to individual participants’ original study intervention allocation at the 1-month postdelivery visit.
6.3.3. Blinding of Site Personnel Prior to the 1-Month Postdelivery Visit
To allow administration of BNT162b2 to maternal participants who originally received 
placebo, site staff will be unblinded to individual participants’ original study intervention allocation at the 1-month postdelivery visit.  Prior to unblinding maternal participants at the 1-month postdelivery visit, this is an obse rver-blinded study. The study staff receiving, 
storing, dispensing, preparing, and administering the study interventions will be unblinded.  All other study and site personnel, including the investigator, investigator staff, and maternal participants, will be blinded to study intervention assignments until the 1-month postdeliveryvisit for each participant.  In particular, the individuals who evaluate maternal participant safety prior to unblinding maternal participants at the 1-month postdelivery visit will be blinded.
Because the BNT162 RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate and placebo are different in 
physical appearance, the study intervention syringes will be administered in a manner that prevents the maternal study participants from identifying the study intervention type based on its appearance during the blinded portion of the study.

6.3.4. Blinding of the Sponsor
The study team will be unblinded to the participant’s study intervention allocation when 
maternal participants complete the 1-month postdelivery visit. Prior to unblinding the maternal participants at the 1-month postdelivery visit the majority of sponsor staff will be blinded to study intervention allocation.  All laboratory testing personnel performing serology assays will remain blinded to study intervention assigned/received.  The following sponsor staff, who will have no part in the blinded conduct of the study, will be unblinded (further details will be provided in a data blinding plan):
•Those study team members who are involved in ensuring that protocol requirements for 
study intervention preparation, handling, allocation, and administration are fulfilled at the site will be unblinded for the duration of the study (eg, unblinded study manager, unblinded clinical research associate).
•Unblinded clinician(s) who are not direct members of the study team and will not 
participate in any other study-related activities will review unblinded protocol deviations.
•An unblinded team supporting interactions with, and analyses for, the DMC 
(seeSection 9.6 ).  This will comprise a statistician, programmer(s), and a medical 
monitor and/or a clinical scientist who will review cases of severe COVID-19 as they are received, and will review AEs at least weekly for additional potential cases of severe COVID-19 (see Section 8.2.4 ).
•An unblinded submissions team will be responsible for preparing unblinded analyses and 
documents to support regulatory activities that may be required while the study is ongoing.  This team will only be unblinded at the group level and not have access to individual participant assignments.  The programs that produce the summary tables will be developed and validated by the blinded study team, and these programs will be run by the unblinded DMC team.

Page 576.3.5. Breaking the Blind
The IRT will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions.  In case of an emergency, the 
investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a maternalparticipant’s vaccine assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the investigator should make every effort to contact the sponsor prior to unblinding a maternal participant’s vaccine assignment unless this could delay further management of the participant.
If a maternal participant’s vaccine assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified 
within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and CRF.
The study-specific IRT reference manual and IP manual will provide the contact information 
and further details on the use of the IRT system.
Instructions on how to unblind participants ahead of administration of BNT162b2 to placebo 
recipients will be provided separately: this unblinding will NOT be performed in the IRT.
6.4. Study Intervention Compliance
When maternal participants are dosed at the site, they will receive study intervention directly 
from the investigator or designee, under medical supervision.  The date and time of each dose administered in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents and recorded in the CRF.  The dose of study intervention and maternal study participant identification will be confirmed at the time of dosing by a member of the study site staff other than the person administering the study intervention.
6.5. Concomitant Therapy
6.5.1. Prohibited During the Study – Maternal ParticipantsReceipt of the following vaccines and medications during the time periods listed below may 
exclude a maternal participant from the per-protocol analysis from that point onwards, and may require vaccinations to be discontinued in that participant; however, it is anticipated that the maternal participant would not be withdrawn from the study (see Section 7 ).  Medications
should not be withheld if required for a maternal participant’s medical care.
•Unless considered medically necessary, no vaccines other than study intervention should 
be administered within 14 days before and 7 days after each study vaccination, including seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines.
•Receipt of chronic systemic treatment with known immunosuppressant medications 
within 60 days before enrollment through conclusion of the study.
•Receipt of systemic corticosteroids ( ≥20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent)

7. DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND PARTICIPANT 
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL
7.1. Discontinuation of Study InterventionIn rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant to permanently discontinue study 
intervention (definitive discontinuation). Reasons for definitive discontinuation of study intervention include the following: AEs; participant request; investigator request; protocol deviation (including no longer meeting all the inclusion criteria, or meeting 1 or more exclusion criteria). In general, unless the investigator considers it unsafe to administer the second dose, or the maternal participant does not wish to receive it, it is preferred that the second dose be administered. Note: following Vaccination 1, a positive SARS-CoV-2 NAAT result without symptoms or a COVID-19 diagnosis (signs/symptoms only or signs/symptoms and a positive SARS-CoV-2 NAAT result) should not result in discontinuation from the study intervention.
Note that discontinuation of study intervention does not represent withdrawal from the study.  
Per the study estimands if study intervention is definitively discontinued, the participant will remain in the study to be evaluated for safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity. See the SoA
for data to be collected at the time of discontinuation of study intervention and follow-up for any further evaluations that need to be completed.
In the event of discontinuation of study intervention, it must be documented on the 
appropriate CRF/in the medical records whether the participant is discontinuing further receipt of study intervention or also from study procedures, postvaccination study follow-up, and/or future collection of additional information.

Page 607.2. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal From the Study
A maternal participant may withdraw from the st udy at any time at her own request or the 
infant participant may be withdrawn at any time at the request of his/her parent(s).  Reasons for discontinuation from the study include the following:
•Refused further follow-up;
•Lost to follow-up;
•Death;
•Study terminated by sponsor;
•AEs;
•Maternal participant request; 
•Investigator request;
•Protocol deviation.
If a participant does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact 
the participant.  All attempts to contact the participant and information received during contact attempts must be documented in the participant’s source document.  In any circumstance, every effort should be made to document participant outcome, if possible.
The investigator or his or her designee should capture the reason for withdrawal in the CRF 
for all participants.
If a participant withdraws from the study, she may request destruction of any remaining 
samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document any such requests in the site study records and notify the sponsor accordingly.
If the participant withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent (see Section 7.2.1 ) 
for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be collected.  The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent.
Lack of completion of all or any of the withdrawal/early termination procedures will not be 
viewed as protocol deviations so long as the participant’s safety was preserved.

Page 617.2.1. Withdrawal of Consent
Participants who request to discontinue receipt of study intervention will remain in the study 
and must continue to be followed for protocol-specified follow-up procedures.  The only exception to this is when a participant specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with her.  Participants should notify the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw consent from future follow-up, whenever possible.  The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is only from further receipt of study intervention or also from study procedures and/or postvaccination study follow-up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page.  In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in accordance with local law.
7.3. Lost to Follow-up
A maternal participant will be considered lost to follow-up if she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return for scheduled visits and is 
unable to be contacted by the study site:
•The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study.
•Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods).  These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record.
•Should the participant continue to be unreachable, she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study.
8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
The investigator (or an appropriate delegate at the investigator site) must obtain a signed and 
dated ICD before performing any study-specific procedures.
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA. Protocol waivers or 
exemptions are not allowed.
The full date of birth will be collected to critically evaluate the immune response and safety 
profile by age.

Page 62Safety issues should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or 
awareness to determine whether the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention.
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential 
and required for study conduct.
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential maternal 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all maternal participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
Procedures conducted as part of the maternal participant’s routine clinical management and 
obtained before signing of the ICD may be utilized for baseline and/or screening purposes provided the procedures met the protocol-specified criteria and were performed within the time frame defined in the SoA.
Every effort should be made to ensure that protocol-required tests and procedures are 
completed as described.  However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances outside the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test.  In these cases, the investigator must take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the participant.  When a protocol-required test cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason for the missed test and any corrective and preventive actions that he or she has taken to ensure that required processes are adhered to as soon as possible.  The study team must be informed of these incidents in a timely manner.
For samples being collected and shipped, detailed collection, processing, storage, and 
shipment instructions and contact information will be provided to the investigator site prior to initiation of the study.
The total blood sampling volume in this study is dependent on when a maternal participant is 
enrolled and which vaccine she is given while pregnant. It is expected that most maternal participants will have to give up to 6 blood samples (20 mL each).
Additionally, 20 mL of blood for maternal participants will be taken at an unplanned 
convalescent visit at any time a maternal participant develops respiratory symptoms indicating a potential COVID-19 infection. Maternal participants would therefore have a 
total blood sampling volume of approximately up to 140 mL during the study period.  
Additional blood samples may be taken for safety assessments at times specified by Pfizer, provided the total volume taken during the study does not exceed 550 mL during any period of 60 consecutive days.  Approximately 10 mL of cord blood will be taken from each infant participant; if cord blood is unavailable, a blood sample of up to 5 mL (based on weight) will be collected. A 5-mL blood sample will be collected from each infant at the 6-month postdelivery visit; in addition, a blood sample of up to 5 mL will be collected at each convalescent illness visit.

Page 638.1. Efficacy and/or Immunogenicity Assessments
Surveillance for potential cases of COVID-19 will occur throughout a maternal and infant 
participant’s involvement in the study.  If, at any time, a maternal or infant participant develops acute respiratory illness (see Section 8.13 ), for the purposes of the study he or she
will be considered to potentially have a COVID-19 illness.  In this circumstance, the maternal participant should contact the site, an in-person or telehealth visit should occur, and assessments should be conducted as specified in the SoA.  The assessments will include 
collection of a nasal swab, which will be tested at a central laboratory using an RT-PCR test (Cepheid; FDA approved under EUA), or other equivalent nucleic acid amplification–based test (ie, NAAT), to detect SARS-CoV-2.  In addition, clinical information and results from local standard-of-care tests (as detailed in Section 8.13 ) will be assessed.  The central 
laboratory NAAT result will be used for the case definition, unless no result is available from the central laboratory, in which case a local NAAT result may be used if it was obtained using 1 of the following assays:
•Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2
•Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR test (EUA200009/A001)
•Abbott Molecular/RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay (EUA200023/A001)
8.1.1. Maternal Participants
Two definitions of SARS-CoV-2–related cases, and SARS-CoV-2–related severe cases, will 
be considered (for both, the onset date of the case will be the date that symptoms were first experienced by the maternal participant ; if new symptoms are reported within 4 days after 
resolution of all previous symptoms, they will be considered as part of a single illness):
Confirmed COVID-19, first definition : presence of at least 1 of the following symptoms 
and SARS-CoV-2 NAAT-positive during, or within 4 days before or after, the symptomatic

All infants will have a cord blood sample collected at birth. The total volume of cord blood to be collected for antibody assessment in this study will be approximately 10 mL.
If cord blood is unavailable, a blood sample may be collected from the infant participant up
to 72 hours after birth but preferably within 24 hours after birth. The infant’s weight must be used to determine the volume of blood that can be collected (see Table 1).
The maximum volume of blood collected from the infant in the absence of cord blood will be
no more than 5 mL at planned study visits (based on weight). An additional sample of up to 5 mL may be collected during each unplanned convalescent visit at any time an infantparticipant develops respiratory symptoms indicating a potential COVID-19 infection.

requirements, the samples will be stored for up to 15 years after the end of the study and then 
destroyed.  If allowed by the ICD, stored samples may be used for additional testing to better 
understand the immune responses to the vaccine(s) under study in this protocol, to inform the development of other products, and/or for vaccine-related assay work supporting vaccine programs.  No testing of the participant’s DNA material will be performed.

laboratory measurements may be obtained at any time during the study to assess any 
perceived safety issues.
A clinical assessment, including medical history, will be performed on all maternal 
participants at the first visit to establish a baseline. Significant medical history and observations from any physical examination will be documented in the CRF.
AEs and SAEs are collected, recorded, and reported as defined in Section 8.3 .
Acute reactions within the first 30 minutes after vaccination will be assessed and documented 
in the AE CRF.
The safety parameters also include reactogenicity e-diary reports of local reactions and 
systemic events (including fever) and use of antipyretic medication that occur in the 7 days after administration of the study intervention, where Day 1 is the day of vaccination. Reactogenicity will not be collected in the e- diary for placebo recipients who subsequently 
receive BNT162b2 1 month following delivery. These prospectively self-reported occurrences of local reactions and systemic events are graded as described in Section 8.2.2.
8.2.1. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
Clinical safety laboratory assessments will not be collected in this study.
8.2.2. Electronic Diary
Maternal participants will be required to complete a reactogenicity e-diary through an 
application (see Section 8.15 ) installed on a provisioned device or on the maternal 
participant’s own personal device.  Maternal participants will be asked to monitor and record local reactions, systemic events, and antipyretic medication usage for 7 days following administration of the study intervention, where Day 1 is the day of vaccination.  The reactogenicity e-diary allows recording of these assessments only within a fixed time 
window, thus providing the accurate representation of the participant’s experience at that 
time.  Data on local reactions, systemic events, and antipyretic medication usage reported in the reactogenicity e-diary will be transferred electronically to a third-party vendor, where they will be available for review by investigators and the Pfizer clinicians at all times via an internet-based portal.

Page 70Maternal participants originally randomized to placebo who subsequently receive BNT162b2
1 month following delivery, will not complete a reactogenicity e-diary but will have their local reactions and systemic events detected and reported as AEs in accordance with Section 8.3.2 .
If the maternal participant lives in an area with poor network connection (certain countries 
only), a study staff/field worker may visit the maternal participant in her home or contact her via phone daily after vaccination to assess and record local reactions, systemic events, and temperature each day (beginning in the morning) for 6 days following vaccination (Day 2 through Day 7) where this system of follow-up is well established. Maternal participants may call the site and report additional local reactions and systemic events at any time during the Day 1 through Day 7 reporting period.  The study staff/field worker will be required to record these data on a provisioned device or an application on a personal device, thus providing the accurate representation of the maternal participant’s experience at that time.  For events persisting on Day 7 and use of antipyretic medication continuing on Day 7, the field worker will continue to visit the participant and record information until resolution.
At intervals agreed to by the vendor and Pfizer, these data will be transferred electronically 
into Pfizer's database for analysis and reporting.  These data do not need to be reported by the investigator in the CRF as AEs.
Investigators (or designee) will be required to review the reactogenicity e-diary data online at 
frequent intervals as part of the ongoing safety review.
The investigator or designee must obtain stop dates from the participant for any ongoing 
local reactions, systemic events, or use of antipyretic medication on the last day that the reactogenicity e-diary was completed.  The stop dates should be documented in the source documents and the information entered in the CRF.
8.2.2.1. Grading Scales
The grading scales used in this study to assess local reactions and systemic events as 
described below are derived from the FDA CBER guidelines on toxicity grading scales for healthy adult volunteers enrolled in preventive vaccine clinical trials.

8.2.2.2. Local Reactions
During the reactogenicity e-diary reporting period, maternal participants/study staff 
member/field worker will be asked to assess redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site 
and to record the symptoms in the reactogenicity e-diary.  If a local reaction persists beyond the end of the reactogenicity e-diary period following vaccination, the maternal participant will be requested to report that information.  The investigator/field staff will enter this additional information in the CRF.
Redness and swelling will be measured and recorded by the maternal participants/study staff 
member/field worker in measuring device units (range: 1 to 21) and then categorized during analysis as absent, mild, moderate, or severe based on the grading scale in Table 2 .

Page 71Measuring device units can be converted to centimeters according to the following formula: 
1 measuring device unit = 0.5 cm.  Pain at the injection site will be assessed by the participant as absent, mild, moderate, or severe according to the grading scale in Table 2.
If a Grade 3 local reaction is reported in the reactogenicity e-diary, a telephone contact 
should occur to ascertain further details and determine whether a site visit is clinically indicated.  Only an investigator or medically qualified person is able to classify a participant’s local reaction as Grade 4.  If a participant experiences a confirmed Grade 4 local reaction, the investigator must immediately notify the sponsor and, if it is determined to be related to the administration of the study intervention, further vaccinations will be discontinued in that participant.
Where appropriate, the site staff/field worker will educate the maternal participant regarding 
signs and symptoms that would prompt site contact.

8.2.2.3. Systemic Events
Prior to vaccination on Day 1 , a baseline assessment of fatigue, headache, vomiting, 
nausea, diarrhea, muscle pain, and joint pain will be recorded in the e-diary.
During the reactogenicity e-diary reporting period, maternal participants will be asked to 
assess vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, chills, new or worsened muscle pain, and new or worsened joint pain and to record the symptoms in the reactogenicity e-diary. Based onlocal practice in certain countries/locales, a study staff member/field worker will call or visitmaternal participants daily after vaccination to assess the presence of systemic events during the reactogenicity reporting period. The symptoms will be assessed by the maternal participant as absent, mild, moderate, or severe according to the grading scale in Table 3 .

Page 72Maternal participants will also be instructed to contact site staff if they visit the emergency 
room or are hospitalized for severe fatigue, headache, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after vaccination. Based on local practice in certain countries/locales, maternal participants will be referred to the appropriate healthcare facility at the discretion of the study staff/field worker if there are any concerns, as appropriate. In the event that the maternal participant does not call, the investigator or qualified designee will contact the maternal participant. The study staff/field worker may also contact the maternal participant to obtain additional information on events entered into the e-diary.
If a Grade 3 systemic event is reported in the reactogenicity e-diary, a telephone contact 
should occur to ascertain further details and determine whether a site visit is clinically indicated.  Only an investigator or medically qualified person is able to classify a maternal participant’s systemic event as Grade 4.  If a maternal participant experiences a confirmed Grade 4 systemic event, the investigator must immediately notify the sponsor and, if it is determined to be related to the administration of the study intervention, further vaccinations will be discontinued in that maternal participant.

8.2.2.4. Fever
In order to record information on fever, a thermometer will be given to maternal participants 
with instructions on how to measure oral temperature at home.  Temperature will be collected in the reactogenicity e-diary in the evening daily during the reactogenicity e-diary reporting period.  It will also be collected at any time during the reactogenicity e-diary data collection periods when fever is suspected.  Similarly, based on local practice in certain countries/locales, the study staff/field worker will call or visit maternal participants daily during the reactogenicity reporting period to collect the temperature.
Fever is defined as an oral temperature of ≥38.0°C (100.4°F).  The highest temperature for 
each day will be recorded in the reactogenicity e-diary.  Temperature will be measured and recorded to 1 decimal place.  Temperatures recorded in degrees Fahrenheit will be programmatically converted to degrees Celsius and then categorized during analysis according to the scale shown in Table 4.
If a fever of ≥39.0°C (102.1°F) is reported in the reactogenicity e-diary, a telephone contact 
should occur to ascertain further details and determine whether a site visit is clinically indicated.  Only an investigator or medically qualified person is able to confirm a maternal participant’s fever as >40.0°C (>104.0°F).  If a maternal participant experiences a confirmed fever >40.0°C (>104.0°F), the investigator must immediately notify the sponsor and, if it is determined to be related to the administration of the study intervention, further vaccinations will be discontinued in that maternal participant.

Page 748.2.2.5. Antipyretic Medication
The use of antipyretic medication to treat symptoms associated with study intervention
administration will be recorded in the reactogenicity e-diary daily during the reporting period(Day 1 through Day 7).
8.2.3. Stopping Rules
The following stopping rules are in place for all Phase 2 maternal participants, based on 
review of AE data and e-diary reactogenicity data, until the start of Phase 3. Stopping rules do not apply to maternal participants who initially received placebo and subsequently receive BNT162b2. These data will be monitored on an ongoing basis by the investigator (or medically qualified designee) and sponsor in order to promptly identify and flag any event that potentially contributes to a stopping rule.
In the event that sponsor personnel confirm that a stopping rule is met, the following actions 
will commence:
•The IRC will review all appropriate data.
•The stopping rule will PAUSE randomization and study intervention administration for 
participants receiving the first dose. Maternal participants scheduled to receive Dose 2 at the time of a study pause may proceed with vaccination.
•The DMC will review all appropriate data.
•For all participants vaccinated, all other routine study conduct activities, including 
ongoing data entry, reporting of AEs, participant reactogenicity e-diary completion, blood sample collection, and participant follow-up, will continue during the pause.
A stopping rule is met if any of the following rules occur after administration of 
investigational BNT162b2; data from placebo recipients will not contribute to the stopping rules.  Reactogenicity e-diary data confirmed by the investigator as being entered by theparticipant in error will not contribute toward a stopping rule.
Stopping Rule Criteria:1. If any participant vaccinated with BNT162b2 develops an SAE that is assessed by the 
investigator as possibly related, or for which there is no alternative, plausible, attributable cause.
2. If any participant vaccinated with BNT162b2 develops a Grade 4 local reaction or 
systemic event after vaccination that is assessed as possibly related by the investigator, or for which there is no alternative, plausible, attributable cause.

least 1 daily measurement after vaccination that is assessed as possibly related by the investigator, or for which there is no alternative, plausible, attributable cause.
4. If any 2 participants vaccinated with BNT162b2 report the same or similar severe 
(Grade 3) AE after vaccination, assessed as possibly related by the investigator, or for which there is no alternative, plausible, attributable cause.
5. If any participant dies or requires ICU admission due to SARS-CoV-2 infection; if this 
stopping rule is met, all available clinical and preclinical safety and immunogenicity data should be reviewed to evaluate for enhanced COVID-19.
6. If any participant vaccinated with BNT162b2 experiences any of the following within 
7 days after vaccination, where Day 1 is the day of vaccination: severe vaginal bleeding (eg, partial abruption); severe preeclampsia; eclampsia; HELLP syndrome; life-threatening sequelae of preeclampsia (eg, pulmonary edema); stillbirth; or fetal loss.
7. If ≥2 maternal participants vaccinated with BNT162b2 experience premature delivery or 
preterm premature rupture of membranes within 14 days after vaccination.
8.2.4. Surveillance of Events That Could Represent Enhanced COVID-19
The unblinded team supporting the DMC, including an unblinded medical monitor, will 
review cases of severe COVID-19 as they are received and will review AEs at least weekly for additional potential cases of severe COVID-19.  At any point, the unblinded team may discuss with the DMC chair whether the DMC should review cases.
The purpose of these reviews will be to identify whether any features of each case appear 
unusual, in particular, greater in severity, compared to available information at the time of review.  Indicators of severity may include accelerated deterioration, need for hospitalization, need for ventilation, or death.
Observed rates of these indicators will be compared with what could be expected in a 
population similar to the study participants based upon available information at the time of review.
8.2.5. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
Clinical safety laboratory assessments will not be collected in this study.
8.3. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
The definitions of an AE and an SAE can be found in Appendix 2 .
AEs will be reported by the maternal participant (or the parent[s] for the infant participant).

Page 76The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible to pursue and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcome and to assess whether the event meets the criteria for classification as an SAE or caused the participant to discontinue the study intervention (see Section 7.1 ).
Each maternal participant and parent of the infant participant will be questioned about the 
occurrence of AEs in a nonleading manner.
In addition, the investigator may be requested by Pfizer Safety to obtain specific follow-up 
information in an expedited fashion.
The procedures described in this section pertain to both the infant participant and maternal 
participant, unless otherwise indicated.
8.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each maternal participant including her fetus begins from the time the maternal participant provides informed consent, which is obtained before participation in the study (ie, before undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving study intervention), through and including a minimum of 28 calendar days after the last administration of the study intervention.
In this study, the investigator and site staff will ensure the active elicitation and collection of 
AEs and SAEs through Visit 4.
From Visit 4 through Visit 8, SAEs will be collected for maternal participants originally 
randomized to BNT162b2. In addition, AEs occurring up to 48 hours after blood draws and collection of nasal swabs that are related to study procedures must be reported in the CRF.
Additionally, for those maternal participants who originally received placebo but go on to 
receive BNT162b2 at Visit 101 and Visit 102, AEs and SAEs will be collected through and 1 month after the second dose of BNT162b2 (Visit 103).
For the infant participant, the time period for actively eliciting and collecting nonserious AEs 
(“active collection period”) begins at birth and continues through and including 1 month after birth. SAEs and AESIs will be collected from birth through and including 6 months of age.
Follow-up by the investigator continues throughout and after the active collection period and 
until the AE or SAE or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the 
investigator and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.
For maternal participants who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when 
screen failure status is determined.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 77If the participant withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for the collection of 
future information, the active collection period ends when consent is withdrawn.
If a participant definitively discontinues or temporarily discontinues study intervention 
because of an AE or SAE, the AE or SAE must be recorded on the CRF and the SAE reported using the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form.
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after the participant has 
concluded study participation.  However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has completed the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention, the investigator must promptly report the SAE to Pfizer using the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form.
Note : Potential COVID-19/MIS-C illnesses and their sequelae that are consistent with the 
clinical endpoint definition ( Section 8.1 ) should not be recorded as AEs. These data will be 
captured to describe disease endpoints for lack-of-efficacy assessment data only on the relevant pages of the CRF, as these are expected endpoints.
8.3.1.1. Reporting SAEs to Pfizer Safety
All SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period as described in 
Section 8.3.1 are reported to Pfizer Safety on the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form, if 
applicable, immediately upon awareness and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours.
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, 
spontaneous abortion, including miscarriage and missed abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death defined as those that occur within 1 month of birth, or congenital anomaly [in a live-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month of age should be reported as SAEs.
Further follow-up may be requested by the sponsor and will be handled on a case-by-case 
basis (eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays).
SAEs occurring in the mother after the active collection period has ended are reported to 
Pfizer Safety if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to study intervention must be reported to Pfizer Safety.
For those SAEs or deaths that occur to the infant after the active collection period should be 
reported when the investigator believes the SAE or death has at least a reasonable possibility of being related to study intervention.

Page 788.3.1.2. Recording Nonserious AEs and SAEs in the CRF
All nonserious AEs and SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period, 
which begins after obtaining informed consent as described in Section 8.3.1 , will be recorded 
on the AE section of the CRF.
The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly observed and all spontaneously reported 
AEs and SAEs reported by the participant.
The investigator obtains general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for all study 
participants.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination).  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless preprocedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, 
spontaneous abortion, including miscarriage and missed abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death defined as those deaths that occur within 1 month of birth, or congenital anomaly (in a live-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death), the investigator should record this information in the CRF.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month of age should be recorded in the CRF as SAEs.
8.3.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 2 .
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs.  Open-ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences.
8.3.3. Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts.  For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3 ).
In general, follow-up information will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality.  Any information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications 
and illnesses, must be provided.  In the case of a participant death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer Safety.
Further information on follow-up procedures is given in Appendix 2 .

Page 798.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation.  The sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs/ECs, and investigators.
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for SUSARs according to local regulatory 
requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary.
An investigator who receives SUSARs or other specific safety information (eg, summary or 
listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the SRSD(s) for the study and will notify the IRB/EC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
8.3.5. Additional Exposure Scenarios That May Result From the Exposure to the Study 
Intervention
8.3.5.1. Environmental Exposure During PregnancyEnvironmental exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the study intervention, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE.  Such persons 
may include HCPs, family members, and other roles that are involved in the trial participant’s care.
Note: This does NOT apply to maternal participants enrolled in this trial.
•The scenarios below describe environmental exposures that could lead to an EDP:
•A female is found to be pregnant while being exposed or having been exposed to 
study intervention by environmental exposure. Below are some examples:
•A female family member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant after 
having been exposed to the study intervention by inadvertent product administration via needlestick.
•A male family member or healthcare provider who has been exposed to the study 
intervention then exposes his female partner prior to or around the time of conception.

Page 80The investigator must report EDP to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The investigator must report information to Pfizer Safety using the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form and EDP Supplemental Form.  The initial information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy). Since the exposure information does not pertain to the participant enrolled in the study, the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed Vaccine SAE Reporting Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
Follow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer Safety of the outcome as a follow-up to the initial EDP Supplemental Form.
In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of 
birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless preprocedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes are considered SAEs. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets 
the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to Pfizer Safety as SAEs 
follows: 
•Spontaneous abortion including miscarriage and missed abortion;
•Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the study intervention.
Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by the sponsor. Further 
follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis (eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays).

Page 818.3.5.2. Exposure During Breastfeeding
Exposure-during-breastfeeding reports are not expected for maternal participants who 
breastfeed a child delivered during the study.
Environmental exposure during breastfeeding occurs when a female family member or 
healthcare provider who reports that she is breastfeeding after having been exposed to the study intervention (eg, by inhalation or skin contact).  The investigator must report exposure during breastfeeding to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The information must be reported using the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form. When exposure during breastfeeding occurs in the setting of environmental exposure, the exposure information does not pertain to the participant enrolled in the study , so the information is not recorded on a CRF. However, a copy of the completed 
Vaccine SAE Reporting Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
An exposure-during-breastfeeding report is not created when a Pfizer drug specifically 
approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with authorized use. However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such a drug, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.
8.3.5.3. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when a person receives unplanned direct contact with the 
study intervention, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE.  Such persons may include healthcare providers, family members, and other roles that are involved in the trial participant’s care.
The investigator must report occupational exposure to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, regardless of whether there is an associated SAE.  The information must be reported using the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form.  Since the information does not pertain to a participant enrolled in the study, the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed Vaccine SAE Reporting Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.3.6. Cardiovascular and Death Events
Not applicable.
8.3.7. Disease-Related Events and/or Disease-Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as AEs 
or SAEs
Potential COVID-19/MIS-C illnesses and their sequelae that are consistent with the clinical 
endpoint definition should notbe recorded as AEs. These data will be captured as efficacy

Page 82Potential COVID-19/MIS-C illnesses and their sequelae will not be reported according to the 
standard process for expedited reporting of SAEs, even though the event may meet the definition of an SAE.  These events will be recorded on the COVID-19 illness pages in the participant’s CRF within 1 day.
NOTE: However, if either of the following conditions applies, then the event must be 
recorded and reported as an SAE (instead of a disease-related event):
The event is, in the investigator’s opinion, of greater intensity, frequency, or duration 
than expected for the individual participant.
ORThe investigator considers that there is a reasonable possibility that the event was related 
to study intervention.
Potential COVID-19/MIS-C illness events and their sequelae will be reviewed by a group of 
internal blinded case reviewers.  Any SAE that is determined by the internal case reviewers NOT to meet endpoint criteria is reported back to the investigator site of incidence.  The investigator must report the SAE to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of being made aware that the SAE did not meet endpoint criteria.  The investigator’s SAE awareness date is the date on which the investigator site of incidence receives the SAE back from the internal case reviewers.
8.3.8. Adverse Events of Special Interest
This section provides information on AESIs that may be detected during the study. The 
following events are considered AESIs:
•A confirmed diagnosis of myocarditis or pericarditis. See Section 8.14 for additional 
procedures for monitoring of potential myocarditis or pericarditis.
For Infant Participants:
•Major congenital anomaly
•Developmental delay
All AESIs must be reported as an AE or SAE following the procedures described in 
Section 8.3.1 through Section 8.3.4 . An AESI is to be recorded as an AE or SAE on the 
CRF. In addition, an AESI that is also an SAE must be reported using the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form.
8.3.8.1. Lack of Efficacy

Page 858.11. Study Procedures – Maternal Participants
The following procedures apply to both Phase 2 and Phase 3 maternal participants.
8.11.1. Visit 1: Screening (-28 Days to Vaccination 1)
Before enrollment and before any study-related procedures are performed, voluntary, written 
study-specific informed consent will be obtained from the maternal participant.  Each signature on the ICD must be personally dated by the signatory.  The investigator or his or her designee will also sign the ICD.  A copy of the signed and dated ICD must be given to the maternal participant.  The source data must reflect that the informed consent was obtained before participation in the study.
Standard-of-care procedures performed prior to informed consent can be considered for use 
in the study provided they follow guidance around the timing of procedures stipulated in the protocol.
In countries/locales where procedures to confirm maternal participant eligibility for this 
clinical trial are not routinely performed, the procedures must be obtained and reviewed by the investigator or qualified designee up to 28 days prior to vaccination.
It is anticipated that the procedures below will be conducted in a stepwise manner; ensure 
that procedures listed prior to administration of the vaccine are conducted prior to vaccination.
The following procedures will be performed:
•Obtain and record the participant demography (including complete date of birth 
[dd-Mmm-YYYY], sex, race, racial designation, and ethnicity).  The date of birth will be collected to critically evaluate the immune response and safety profile by age.
•Obtain and record current alcohol and tobacco usage.
•Phase 3 only: For participants who are HIV-infected, record HIV viral load and CD4 
count results from the most recent test performed in the previous 6 months.
•Obtain and record the LMP and EDD.
•Measure and record vital signs, including oral temperature, seated blood pressure, and 
heart rate.
•Perform physical examination including but not limited to weight and height, evaluating 
any clinically significant abnormalities within the following body systems: general 
appearance; skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; heart; lungs; abdomen; musculoskeletal; extremities; neurological; and lymph nodes.

(≥39.0°C [102.1°F]) ( Section 8.2.2.4 ) is reported in the reactogenicity e-diary, a telephone 
contact should occur to ascertain further details and determine whether a site visit is clinically indicated. If suspected Grade 4 local reaction ( Section 8.2.2.2 ), systemic event 
(Section 8.2.2.3 ), or fever (>40.0°C [>104.0°F]) ( Section 8.2.2.4 ) is reported in the 
reactogenicity e-diary, a telephone contact or site visit should occur to confirm the fever and whether the event meets the criteria for Grade 4.
A site visit must be scheduled as soon as possible to assess the participant unless any of the 
following is true:
•The participant is unable to attend the unscheduled visit.
•The local reaction/systemic event is no longer present at the time of the telephone 
contact.
•The participant recorded an incorrect value in the reactogenicity e-diary (confirmation of 
a reactogenicity e-diary data entry error).
•The PI or authorized designee determined it was not needed.
This telephone contact will be recorded in the participant’s source documentation and the 
CRF.
If the participant is unable to attend the unscheduled visit, or the PI or authorized designee 
determined it was not needed, any ongoing local reactions/systemic events must be assessed at the next study visit.
During the unscheduled visit, the reactions should be assessed by the investigator or a 
medically qualified member of the study staff such as a study physician or a study nurse, as applicable to the investigator’s local practice, who will:
•Measure body temperature (°F/°C).

page of the CRF.
8.13. COVID-19 Surveillance (All Maternal Participants)
If a participant experiences any of the following from the time of vaccination (irrespective of 
perceived etiology or clinical significance), she is instructed to contact the site immediately
and, if confirmed, participate in an in-person or telehealth visit as soon as possible, optimally within 3 days after symptom onset (and at the latest 4 days after symptom resolution).Note that:
•If new symptoms are reported within 4 days after resolution of all previous symptoms, 
they will be considered as part of a single illness and a second illness visit is not required;
•Surveillance of potential COVID-19 symptoms should continue even if a participant has 
a positive SARS-CoV-2 test earlier in the study.
During the 7 days following each vaccination, potential COVID-19 symptoms that overlap 
with specific systemic events (ie, fever, chills, new or increased muscle pain, diarrhea, vomiting) should not trigger a potential COVID-19 illness visit unless, in the investigator’s opinion, the clinical picture is more indicative of a possible COVID-19 illness than vaccine reactogenicity.
If, in the investigator’s opinion, the symptoms are considered more likely to be vaccine 
reactogenicity, but a participant is required to demonstrate that they are SARS-CoV-2–negative, a local SARS-CoV-2 test may be performed: if positive, the 
symptoms should be recorded as a potential COVID-19 illness; if not, the symptoms should be recorded as AEs (unless already captured in the reactogenicity e-diary).

8.13.1. Potential Maternal COVID-19 Illness Visit (Optimally Within 3 Days After 
Potential COVID-19 Illness Onset)
This visit may be conducted as an in-person or telehealth visit; a telehealth visit involves the 
sharing of healthcare information and services via telecommunication technologies (eg, audio, video, videoconferencing software) remotely, thus allowing the participant and investigator to communicate on aspects of clinical care.
As a participant’s COVID-19 illness may evolve over time, several contacts may be required 
to obtain the following information:

Page 998.15. Communication and Use of Technology
In a study of this nature that requires illness events to be reported outside of scheduled study 
visits, it is vital that communication between the study site and the maternal participant is maintained to ensure that endpoint events are not missed for her or her infant.  This study will employ various methods, tailored to the individual participant, to ensure that communication is maintained and study information can be transmitted securely.  Using appropriate technology, such as a study application, a communication pathway between the participant and the study site staff will be established.  The participant may be able to utilize her own devices to access this technology, or use a device provided by the sponsor.
Traditional methods of telephone communication will also be available.  The technology 
solution may facilitate the following:
•Contact with the investigator, including the ability of the participant to report whether or 
not the participant has experienced symptoms that could represent a potential COVID-19 illness (COVID-19 illness e-diary; see Section 8.13 ).
•An alert in the event that the participant is hospitalized.
•Visit reminders.
•Messages of thanks and encouragement from the study team.
•A platform for recording local reactions and systemic events (reactogenicity e-diary) –
see Section 8.2.2 .
If a maternal participant is not actively completing either the reactogenicity or COVID-19 
illness e-diary, the investigator or designee is required to contact the participant to ascertainwhy and also to obtain details of any missed events.
8.16. SARS-CoV-2 NAAT Results From Visits 1 and 2 and Potential COVID-19 Illness 
Visits
Nasal (midturbinate) swabs for SARS-CoV-2 NAAT are obtained at:
•Visits 1 and 2: To determine whether a participant will be included in efficacy analyses 
of those with no serological or virological evidence (up to 7 days after receipt of the 
second dose) of past SARS-CoV-2 infection.
•Potential COVID-19 illness visits: To determine whether symptoms experienced by the 
participant fulfill the COVID-19 case definition.

Page 100Research laboratory–generated positive results from the Visit 1 and Visit 2 swabs, and all 
results from the illness visit swabs, will be provided to the site once available, but this will not be in real time and cannot be relied upon to direct clinical care.  Therefore, the participant should be directed to seek additional testing through her primary healthcare providers at a licensed clinical laboratory when exhibiting potential COVID-19 symptoms or otherwise receiving a positive result and counseled on whether to take any precautionary measures pending confirmatory testing.
Participants who have a positive SARS-CoV-2 NAAT result prior to Visit 2 should be 
handled as follows:
•Positive SARS-CoV-2 test with no symptoms, either at Visit 1 or any time between 
Visit 1 and Visit 2: A positive test in an asymptomatic participant does not meet exclusion criterion 2; therefore, Vaccination 2 should proceed as normal.
•Confirmed COVID-19 (ie, symptoms and positive SARS-CoV-2 test) diagnosed at 
Visit 1 or any time between Visit 1 and Visit 2 does not meet exclusion criterion 2; therefore, Vaccination 2 should proceed as normal.
8.17. Procedures for Administration of BNT162b2 to Those Originally Assigned to 
Placebo
Maternal participants will be given BNT162b2 at the 1-month postdelivery visit, and will 
follow the procedures listed in this section for the remainder of their participation in the study.
8.17.1. Visit 101 – Vaccination 3 – 1-Month Postdelivery Follow-up (Clinic: 21 to 
35 Days After Delivery)
•Confirm that the participant originally received only placebo at Vaccination 1/2.  
Secondary confirmation by another site staff member is required.
•Before vaccination and before any study-related procedures are performed: Review and 
consider inclusion criteria 2, 5, and 11 and exclusion criteria 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 13, 14, 15, and 17 prior to vaccination. If, in the investigator’s judgment, vaccination is in the best interests of the participant, vaccination may proceed, even if inclusion criteria are not met and exclusion criteria are met. Such exceptions should be recorded in the participant’s source documents.
•Record details of any of the prohibited medications specified in Section 6.5.1 received by 
the participant if required for her clinical care.

8.18. Study Procedures – Infant Participants
8.18.1. Infant Participants: Visit 1 – Delivery
•Manually assign a single infant participant identifier. This will be assigned manually by 
the site using the following convention: the infant participant’s identifier will be the maternal participant’s IRT-generated numeric ID but with the fifth digit changed to a 2 (eg, if the maternal participant is given number 10011001, then the infant will be 10012001).
•Collect demography (including complete date of birth [ie, dd-Mmm-YYYY], sex, race, 
and ethnicity).  The date of birth will be collected to critically evaluate the immune response.
•Measure vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, oxygen saturation by pulse 
oximetry, and respiratory rate.
•Standard-of-care vital signs and examination procedures can be considered for use in the 
study provided they were performed within 48 hours after birth.  Note: Please reference 
the physical examination procedures below for details.
•Perform a physical examination, if not performed as part of standard of care, noting any 
clinically significant abnormalities within the following body systems: general 
appearance; skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; heart; lungs; abdomen; back; musculoskeletal; extremities; genitourinary; neurological; and lymph nodes.  Abnormal results must be recorded on source documents as well as the physical examination pages of the CRF; only if the abnormal finding is deemed to be clinically significant should this be recorded on the AE pages of the CRF.
•Collect and record concomitant medication associated with AE/SAEs.
•Ensure and document that the infant is eligible.
•Collect a cord blood sample of approximately 10 mL for immunogenicity assessments.  
Cord blood is collected from the umbilical cord vein attached to the placenta prior to the 
blood clotting within the cord and after the umbilical cord has been clamped and cut.
•If cord blood is unavailable, a blood sample may be collected from the infant participant 
preferably within 72 hours.  The volume of blood collected will be based on the weight of 
the infant (refer to Table 1 ).
•Record AEs, SAEs, and AESIs as described in Section 8.3 .
•Schedule an appointment for the participant for the next study visit.

Page 1058.19. COVID-19 Surveillance (All Infant Participants)
If an infant participant experiences any of the following (irrespective of perceived etiology or 
clinical significance), the maternal participant is instructed to contact the site immediately and, if confirmed, participate in an in-person or telehealth visit as soon as possible, optimally within 3 days after symptom onset (and at the latest 4 days after symptom resolution). Note that this does not substitute for an infant participant’s routine medical care.  Therefore, maternal participants should be encouraged to seek care, if appropriate, from their infant’s usual provider.
Additionally:
•If new symptoms are reported within 4 days after resolution of all previous symptoms, 
they will be considered as part of a single illness and a second illness visit is not required;
•Surveillance of potential COVID-19 symptoms should continue even if a participant has 
a positive SARS-CoV-2 test earlier in the study.
Signs and symptoms of an acute respiratory illness in the infant will not be considered a 
potential COVID-19–related illness if they occur within the first 72 hours after birth and should not trigger an illness visit.
•A diagnosis of COVID-19;
•Fever; 
•New or increased cough; 
•New or increased shortness of breath;
•Diarrhea;
•Vomiting.
8.19.1. Potential Infant COVID-19/MIS-C Illness Visit (Optimally Within 3 Days After 
Potential COVID-19 Illness Onset)
This visit may be conducted as an in-person or telehealth visit; a telehealth visit involves the 
sharing of healthcare information and services via telecommunication technologies (eg, audio, video, videoconferencing software) remotely, thus allowing the parent and investigator to communicate on aspects of the infant’s clinical care.

Page 1089. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study is 
described here and further detailed in a SAP, which will be maintained by the sponsor.  The SAP may modify what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definitions or their analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.
9.1. Estimands and Statistical Hypotheses
9.1.1. EstimandsThe estimands corresponding to each primary, secondary, and exploratory objective are 
described in the table in Section 3 .
In the primary safety objective evaluations, missing reactogenicity e-diary data will not be 
imputed. Missing AE start dates will be imputed according to Pfizer safety rules. No other missing information will be imputed in the safety analysis.
The estimands to evaluate the immunogenicity objectives are based on the evaluable 
immunogenicity populations ( Section 9.3 ). These estimands estimate the vaccine effect in 
the hypothetical settings where participants follow the study schedules and protocol requirements as directed. Missing antibody results will not be imputed. Immunogenicity results that are below the LLOQ will be set to 0.5 × LLOQ in the analysis; this may be adjusted once additional data on the assay characteristics become available.
The estimands to evaluate the efficacy objectives are based on the evaluable efficacy 
populations ( Section 9.3 ).  These estimands estimate the vaccine effect in the hypothetical 
setting where participants follow the study schedules and protocol requirements as directed.  In addition, VE will also be analyzed by the all-available efficacy (mITT) populations. Missing laboratory results will not be imputed.
9.1.2. Statistical Hypotheses
Due to early enrollment termination and reduced sample size, all endpoints will be analyzed
descriptively without formal hypothesis tests.
9.2. Sample Size Determination
The sample size for the Phase 2 portion of the study and for the entire study is not driven by
statistical hypothesis testing.
For safety outcomes, Table 5 shows the probability of observing at least 1 AE for a given 
true event rate of a particular AE, for various sample sizes. For example, if the true AE rate is 2%, with 100 participants in a vaccine group, there is 95% probability of observing at least 1 AE in Phase 2. If the true AE rate is 1%, with 175 participants in a vaccine group, there is 83% probability of observing at least 1 AE in Phase 3.

Randomized All participants who are assigned a randomization number in the IWR 
system.
Evaluable immunogenicity(maternal)All eligible randomized participants who receive 2 doses of the vaccine 
to which they are randomized with Dose 2 received within the predefined window, have at least 1 valid and determinate immunogenicity result from the blood sample collected within  an appropriate wi ndow, a nd have 
no other important protocol deviations as determined by the clinician.

participants and have no important protocol deviations as determined by 
the clinician.
All-available immunogenicity

9.4. Statistical Analyses
The SAP will be developed and finalized before any analyses are performed and will 
describe the analyses and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data. This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints.
9.4.1. General Considerations
CIs for all endpoints in the statistical analysis will be presented as 2-sided at the 95% level 
unless specified otherwise.
The safety analyses are based on the safety populations.  Participants will be summarized by 
vaccine group according to the study intervention they (or their mothers) actually received.  Missing reactogenicity e-diary data will not be imputed; missing AE dates will be handled according to the Pfizer safety rules.
For all the immunogenicity endpoints, the analysis will be based on the evaluable 
immunogenicity populations. An additional analysis may be performed based on the all-available immunogenicity populations if there is a large enough difference in sample size between the all-available immunogenicity populations and the evaluable immunogenicity populations.  Participants will be summarized according to the vaccine group to which they (or their mothers) were randomized.  Missing serology data will not be imputed.
9.4.1.1. Analyses for Binary Data
Descriptive statistics for categorical variables (eg, proportions) are the percentage (%), the 
numerator (n) and the denominator (N) used in the percentage calculation, and the 95% CIs where applicable.
The exact 95% CI for binary endpoints for each group will be computed using the 
F distribution (Clopper-Pearson). The 95% CI for the between-group difference for binary endpoints will be calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen method.
The 3-tier approach will be used to summarize AEs.  For both Tier 1 (if any are identified 
during the study) and Tier 2 events, a 95% CI for the between-group difference in proportions will be calculated based on the Miettinen and Nurminen method.  In addition, for Tier 1 events (if any), the asymptotic p-values will also be presented for the difference in proportions, based on the same test statistic and under the assumption that the test statistic is asymptotically normally distributed.  For Tier 3 events, counts and percentages for each vaccine group will be provided.

Page 1119.4.1.2. Analyses for Continuous Data
Unless otherwise stated, descriptive statistics for continuous variables are n, mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.
9.4.1.2.1. Geometric Means
The geometric means will be calculated as the mean of the assay results after making the 
logarithm transformation and then exponentiating the mean to express results on the original scale.  Two-sided 95% CIs will be obtained by taking log transforms of assay results, calculating the 95% CI with reference to Student’s t-distribution, and then exponentiating the confidence limits.
9.4.1.2.2. Geometric Mean Fold Rises
GMFRs are defined as ratios of the results after vaccination to the results before vaccination.  
GMFRs are limited to participants with nonmissing values at both time points.
GMFRs will be calculated as the mean of the difference of logarithmically transformed 
neutralization titers or antibody levels (later time point minus earlier time point) and exponentiating the mean.  The associated 2-sided 95% CIs are obtained by constructing CIs using Student’s t-distribution for the mean difference on the logarithm scale and exponentiating the confidence limits.
9.4.1.2.3. Geometric Mean Ratios
The GMR will be calculated as the mean of the difference of logarithmically transformed 
assay results (eg, SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers in pregnant women minus that in nonpregnant women) and exponentiating the mean.  Two-sided CIs will be obtained by calculating CIs using Student’s t-distribution for the mean difference of the logarithmically transformed assay results and exponentiating the confidence limits.
9.4.1.2.4. Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curves
Empirical RCDCs will plot proportions of participants with values equal to or exceeding a 
specified assay value versus the indicated assay value, for all observed assay values.  Data points will be joined by a step function with data points on the left side of the step.
9.4.2. Primary Endpoint(s)
Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods
Safety (maternal
participants)Descriptive statistics will be provided for each reactogenicity endpoint for each dose 
and vaccine group.  Local reactions and systemic events from Day 1 through Day 7 
after each vaccination (where Day 1 is the day of vaccination) will be presented by severity and cumulatively across severity levels.  Descriptive summary statistics will include counts and percentages of participants with the indicated endpoint and the associated Clopper-Pearson 95% CIs (see Section 9.4.1.1 ).

AEs will be categorized according to MedDRA terms.  Counts, percentages, and the 
associated Clopper-Pearson 95% CIs of AEs from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2 
will be provided for each vaccine group. A 3-tier approach will be used to summarize 
AEs in Phase 2/3. Under this approach AEs are classified into 1 of 3 tiers: (1) Tier 1 events are prespecified events of clinical importance and are identified in a list in the product’s safety review plan; (2) Tier 2 events are those that are not Tier 1 but are considered “relatively common”; a MedDRA preferred term is defined as a Tier 2 event if there are at least 1% of participants in at least 1 vaccine group reporting the 
event; and (3) Tier 3 events are those that are neither Tier 1 nor Tier 2 events. 
Analysis methods are described in Section 9.4.1.1 .
SAEs will be categorized according to MedDRA terms.  Counts, percentages, and the 
associated Clopper-Pearson 95% CIs of SAEs from Dose 1 through 1 month after delivery will be provided for each vaccine group.

Page 122Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor may include but are not limited 
to:
•Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/EC 
or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines;
•Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator;
•Discontinuation of further study intervention development.
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor shall promptly inform the 
investigators, the ECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any CRO(s) used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator shall promptly inform the participant and should assure appropriate participant therapy and/or follow-up.
Study termination is also provided for in the clinical study agreement.  If there is any conflict 
between the contract and this protocol, the contract will control as to termination rights.
10.1.9. Publication Policy
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings by the 
investigator after publication of the overall study results or 1 year after the end of the study (or study termination), whichever comes first.
The investigator agrees to refer to the primary publication in any subsequent publications 
such as secondary manuscripts, and submits all manuscripts or abstracts to the sponsor 30 days before submission.  This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments and the investigator will, on request, remove any previously undisclosed confidential information before disclosure, except for any study- or Pfizer intervention-related information necessary for the appropriate scientific presentation or understanding of the study results.
For all publications relating to the study, the investigator will comply with recognized ethical 
standards concerning publications and authorship, including those established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.
The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of the overall study results 
covering all investigator sites.  In accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will support publication of multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data.  In this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement.
Authorship of publications for the overall study results will be determined by mutual 
agreement and in line with International Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements.

10.1.10. Sponsor’s Qualified Medical Personnel
The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the 
study is documented in the study contact list located in the supporting study documentation.
To facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study-related medical 
questions or problems, participants are provided with a contact card at the time of informed consent.  The contact card contains, at a minimum, protocol and study interventionidentifiers, participant numbers, contact information for the investigator site, and contact details for a contact center in the event that the investigator site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the participant’s participation in the study.  The contact number can also be used by investigator staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used only in the event that the established communication pathways between the investigator site and the study team are not available.  It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the established communication pathways between the investigator site and the study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study.  The contact number is not intended for use by the participant directly, and if a participant calls that number, she will be directed back to the investigator site.

Evaluating, Follow-up, and Reporting
For maternal immunization clinical studies conducted in pregnant women, data on the EDP 
as well as pregnancy outcome are collected and analyzed in the clinical database.  For these studies, in general, EDP cases are not reportable unless associated with SAEs/nonseriousAEs.
The term “participant” in this section refers to (1) the maternal participant and her fetus; and 
after delivery (2) the maternal participant and (3) the infant participant.
10.2.1. Definition of AE
AE Definition
•An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, 
temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention.
•NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study intervention.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
•Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) 
or other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital sign measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. Any abnormal laboratory test results that meet any of the conditions below must be recorded as an AE:
•Is associated with accompanying symptoms;
•Requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;
•Leads to a change in study dosing (outside of any protocol-specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy.
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
•New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction.

Page 125•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication.  Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent.  Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
•Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the 
investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.
•The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.
•Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.
•Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
•Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
10.2.2. Definition of SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease).
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life-threatening
The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.

Page 126c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving 
at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting.  Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs.  If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a preexisting condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.
d.Results in persistent disability/incapacity
•The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.
•This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f.Other situations:
•Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition.  These events should usually be considered serious.
•Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
•Suspected transmission via a Pfizer product of an infectious agent, pathogenic or 
non-pathogenic, is considered serious.  The event may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings indicating an infection in a patient exposed to a Pfizer product.  The terms “suspected transmission” and “transmission” are considered synonymous .  These cases are considered unexpected and handled as 
serious expedited cases by pharmacovigilance personnel.  Such cases are also considered for reporting as product defects, if appropriate.

Page 12710.2.3. Recording/Reporting and Follow-up of AEs and/or SAEs
AE and SAE Recording/Reporting
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording safety events on the CRF and 
for reporting safety events on the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form to Pfizer Safety.  These requirements are delineated for 3 types of events: (1) SAEs; (2) nonserious AEs; and (3) occupational exposure.
It should be noted that the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form for reporting of SAE information 
is not the same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using concise medical terminology and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form for reporting of SAE information.
Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the Vaccine SAE 
Reporting Form to Pfizer Safety 
Within 24 Hours of Awareness
SAE All All
Nonserious AE All None
Exposure to the study intervention under study via occupational exposureOccupational exposure is not 
recorded.Occupational exposure (regardless 
of whether associated with an AE)Note: Include all AEs/SAEs associated with occupational 
exposure.
•When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostic 
reports) related to the event.
•The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.
•It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s 
medical records to Pfizer Safety in lieu of completion of the Vaccine SAE ReportingForm/AE/SAE CRF page.
•There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are 
requested by Pfizer Safety.  In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to Pfizer Safety.
•The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 128Assessment of Intensity
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during 
the study and assign it to 1 of the following categories: 
GRADE If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator will use the adjectives MILD, 
MODERATE, SEVERE, or LIFE-THREATENING to describe the maximum intensity of the AE. For purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined as follows:
1 MILD Does not interfere with participant's usual function.
2 MODERATE Interferes to some extent with participant's usual function.
3 SEVERE Interferes significantly with participant's usual function.
4 LIFE-THREATENING Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.
Assessment of Causality
•The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention 
and each occurrence of each AE/SAE.
•A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.
•The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
•Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration, will be considered and investigated.
•The investigator will also consult the IB and/or product information, for marketed 
products, in his/her assessment.
•For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
•There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to the sponsor.  However, it is 
very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor.

Page 129•The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up 
information and send an SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.
•The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.
•If the investigator does not know whether or not the study intervention caused the 
event, then the event will be handled as “related to study intervention” for reporting purposes, as defined by the sponsor.  In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form and in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements.
Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
•The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the sponsor to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible.  This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other healthcare providers.
•If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized 
follow-up period, the investigator will provide  Pfizer Safety with a copy of any 
postmortem findings including histopathology.
•New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF.
•The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.
10.2.4. Reporting of SAEs
SAE Reporting to Pfizer Safety via an Electronic Data Collection Tool
•The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to Pfizer Safety will be the electronic 
data collection tool.
•If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data 
collection tool (see next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours.

Page 130•The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as the data 
become available.
•After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be 
taken off-line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.
•If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated 
data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off-line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next section) or to Pfizer Safety by telephone.
SAE Reporting to Pfizer Safety via Vaccine SAE Reporting Form
•Facsimile transmission of the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form is the preferred method 
to transmit this information to Pfizer Safety.
•In circumstances when the facsimile is not working, notification by telephone is 
acceptable with a copy of the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form sent by overnight mail or courier service.
•Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to 
complete and sign the Vaccine SAE Reporting Form pages within the designated reporting time frames.

Page 13110.3. Appendix 3: Liver Safety: Suggested Actions and Follow-up Assessments
Potential Cases of Drug Induced Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determined by elevations in 
transaminases) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury, but adapt are termed “adaptors.”  In some participants, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome.  These participants fail to adapt and therefore are "susceptible" to progressive and serious liver injury, commonly referred to as DILI.  Participants who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 × ULN should be monitored more frequently to determine if they are an “adaptor” or are “susceptible.”
LFTs are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in this study.  However, 
should an investigator deem it necessary to assess LFTs because a participant presents with clinical signs/symptoms, such LFT results should be managed and followed as described below.
Studies that include more detailed hepatic safety assessments (eg, an external hepatic expert 
panel or DMC that has separate definitions and charter) will still need to follow the reporting guidelines described below for applicable cases.
In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in AST and/or ALT precede TBili elevations 
(>2 × ULN) by several days or weeks.  The increase in TBili typically occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated above 3 × ULN (ie, AST/ALT and TBili values will be elevated within the same laboratory sample).  In rare instances, by the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have decreased.  This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal elevations in either AST OR ALT in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy’s law criteria) cases and should always be considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury have been excluded.
The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the 
participant’s individual baseline values and underlying conditions.  Participants who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values:
Participants with AST/ALT and TBili baseline values within the normal range who 
subsequently present with AST OR ALT values >3 × ULN AND a TBili value >2 × ULN 
with no evidence of hemolysis and an alkaline phosphatase value <2 × ULN or not available.
For participants with baseline AST OR ALT OR TBili values above the ULN, the following 
threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:
Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 × ULN; or >8 × ULN (whichever is smaller).

Protocol C4591015Final Protocol Amendment 5, 08 March 2022
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 132Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from baseline value 
by an amount of at least 1 × ULN or if the value reaches >3 × ULN (whichever is smaller).
Rises in AST/ALT and TBili separated by more than a few weeks should be assessed 
individually based on clinical judgment; any case where uncertainty remains as to whether it represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor.  The Hepatic Injury Council (HIC) should be informed if such a situation occurs during the study; the HIC will provide the necessary support to the study team.
The participant should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history, and physical assessment.  For oncology studies, the possibility of hepatic neoplasia (primary or secondary) should be considered.
In addition to repeating measurements of AST and ALT and TBili for suspected cases of 
Hy’s law, additional laboratory tests should include albumin, CK, direct and indirect bilirubin, GGT, PT/INR, total bile acids, and alkaline phosphatase.  Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology.  A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen/paracetamol (either by itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over the counter medications), recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family history, sexual history, travel history, history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) and collection of serum samples for acetaminophen/paracetamol drug and/or protein adduct levels may be warranted.
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria of AST/ALT and 
TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases if no other reason for the LFT abnormalities has yet been found.  Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy’s law) case becomes a confirmed case only after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology.

Sponsor  Edwards Lifesciences  
 
Objectives  To assess the safety and effectiveness of the EDWARDS 
INTUITY Valve System in subject s with aortic stenosis or 
stenosis -insufficiency requiring primary replacement of the 
native aortic valve  in the premarket and post market phases .   
 
Safety was determined by comparing safety endpoints to the 
objective performance criteria (OPC) defined by ANNEX R,  
Section R 2, Table R.1  of BS EN  ISO 5840: 2009  
(Cardiovascular implants –  Cardiac valve prostheses)  and 
effectiveness  was evaluated based on improvement in 
NYHA Class and hemodynamic parameters compared to 
baseline.   
 
Trial  Design  Prospective, non -randomized, multi -center  trial. Pre market 
analysis  was performed when the total late-patient  years  
reached 800 and the number of subjects completing the one 
year (or greater) follow -up reached  or exceeded  300. Post-
market, all active subjects will be followed until the last 
enrolled subject completes their 5- year follow up.  
 
 
Trial  Population  The trial population consists of subjects enrolled in the 
TRANSFORMTM Trial.  
 
Number of Subject s 
There were 934 subjects enrolled at 29 clinical sites.  All 
active subjects will continue follow up until the last enrolled 
subject completes their 5 -year follow up  
Gender/Age  Males and females, 18 years of age or older  
 
During the enrollment phase of the trial, the following 
Inclusion, Exclusion and Intra- operative Exclusion Criteria

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 BACKGROUND  
Regulatory History  
Edwards Lifesciences began discussions of the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite Valve System 
with FDA in September 2007.   The TRANSFORMTM Study Investigational Device 
Exemptions (IDE) application was submitted in October 2011 and IDE G110189 was approved in June 2012.   Enrollment in the study began September 26, 2012 and closed 
August 25, 2016.  
Annual follow up will continue on all subjects  enrolled in the TRANSFORM
TM Study until the 
last subject completes 5- year follow up visit.  
Premarket Approval P150036 (PMA) was granted August 12, 2016. The conditions of the

 1.2 EDWARDS INTUITY VALVE SYSTEM  
The EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system consists of the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve, model 8300AB and the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite delivery system, model 8300DB. The pericardial stented aortic valve is based on the design and the proven performance of 
the PERI MOUNT valve family. A balloon expandable stainless steel cloth -covered frame is 
incorporated into the inflow aspect of the valve. The valve is implanted with the aid of a 
delivery system, which incorporates a balloon catheter to expand the frame within the  left 
ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). The expandable frame works in conjunction with the sewing ring to position and stabilize the valve at implant. The system reduces the number

of sutures required to secure the valve, while the frame establishes a seal  within the LVOT. 
The system may be used in both traditional and less invasive surgical procedures for heart 
valve replacement.  
Two generations of the EDWARDS INTUITY Valve System were investigated in the 
TRANSFORM Trial:  
 GEN -I:  Valve Model 8300ACA and Delivery System Model 8300DCA  
 GEN -II:  Valve Model 8300ACD and Delivery System Model 8300DCD  
The GEN -I device was used early on in the IDE trial and was replaced by the GEN -II 
device.  
The trial valve system c onsists of the trial valve, model 8300ACA, (Figure  1-A) and the trial 
delivery system, model 8300DCA (Figure 1 -C) or trial valve, model 8300AC D (Figure 1 -B) 
and the trial delivery system, model 8300DC D, (Figure 1 -D). The trial valve is a modified 
Carpentier -Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Ease Aortic bioprosthesis (model 3300TFX2). 
The trial valve enables the surgeon to position and secure the valve with three sutures and 
then further secure the valve in the annulus with a balloon expandable frame to control paravalvular leak.  An expandable stainless steel cloth- covered frame is incorporated into 
the inflow aspect of the valve and is implanted with the aid of a delivery system, which is 
used to expand the frame within the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and works in 
conjunction with the sewing ring to position and stabilize the trial  valve at implant. The 
system reduces the number of sutures required to secure the trial valve, while establishing 
the seal between the aortic annulus and the frame. The system may be used in both 
traditional and less invasive surgical procedures (mini sternotomy or right thoracotomy) for 
aortic heart valve replacement  in patients with aortic stenosis or aortic 
stenosis/insufficiency .  It is not intended for patients with pure insuff iciency and it cannot be 
implanted using a transcatheter or transapical approach.

The trial valve  is a stented trileaflet  valve comprised of bovine pericardium that has been 
preserved in a buffered glutaraldehyde solution.  
The leaflets are mounted on a flexible cobalt -chromium alloy wireform. The inflow of the 
bioprosthesis incorporates the cloth -covered balloon expandable stainless steel frame that 
is attached to the inflow side of the valve. The valve leaflets are treated with the Carpentier -
Edwards ThermaFix process, which involves heat treatment of the tissue in glutaraldehyde 
and uses ethanol and polysorbate- 80 (a surfactant). The valve is packaged and terminally 
sterilized in glutaraldehyde. Glutaraldehyde is shown to both reduce the antigenicity of

tissue xenograft bioprostheses and increase tissue stability. The trial valve is available in 
sizes 19, 21, 23, 25, and 27 mm.   
The wireform is made of a corrosion resistant, cobalt -chromium alloy chosen due to its 
spring efficiency and fatigue- resistant characteristics. The wireform is covered with a 
knitted polyester fabric. A thin, cobalt -chromium alloy/polyester film lam inate band 
surrounds the base of the wireform. A silicone sewing ring which is covered with a porous, 
seamless polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) cloth is attached to the wireform. The scalloped sewing ring is designed to conform to the natural aortic annulus.  The annulus frame which 
is made from stainless steel (SST) is sewn to the inflow side of the valve in order to control paravalvular leak. The annulus frame has a scallop- shaped continuous ring on the outflow 
side which matches the contour of the inflow side of the model 3300TFX valve.  The 
scallop -shaped ring is sewn and not welded to the valve wireform  and hence does not 
affect the outward cusp movement of the trial  valve wireform during valve operation. The 
annulus frame sits in the intra- annular position. The inner and outer surfaces of the frame 
are covered with a knitted PTFE cloth and the annulus frame is covered with polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) cloth.  The annulus frame is crimped as part of the manufacturing process and remains in this state unt il used. Please note that the base valve 
in the trial valve system is never crimped. The compliant nature of the sewing ring 
facilitates coaptation between the bioprosthesis and an often irregular or calcific tissue bed. The sewing ring has three suture markers to aid in valve orientation and suture placement. A holder is attached to the valve by means of sutures to facilitate handling, deployment, 
and suturing the valve during implantation. The holder is easily detached by the surgeon.  
1.2.1  MODEL  8300ACA/AC D VALVE DIFFERENCES  
Three minor modifications were  made to achieve the valve model 8300AC D.  1) In order to 
enhance seating of the valve during implant  the cloth on the frame was shifted down closer 
to the inflow edge of the annulus frame .   Since the cloth on the annulus frame was moved 
down, the resulting tissue annulus diameter (TAD) was reduced by one mm, which is 
identical to the model 3300TFX.  2) The single crimped cloth- covered expandable stainless 
steel frame is now double crimped to fur ther reduce the implant profile.   3) The valve 
holder is cusp -mounted instead of commissural -mounted to increase the visibility for the 
nadir suture markers. Also, t here was a modification in the method of sewing the holder

onto the valve. Additionally, the holder material was changed to Delrin 500 which is the 
same material used with all  Edwards’ valve holders and can now be molded as opposed to 
machined.  Finally, the new holder has a key -lock fitting which is size -dependent to match 
the modified delivery system, Model 8300DC D.   
There are no changes to the implant procedure, materials, or packaging. The valve is still 
attached to the native annulus with only three sutures and uses a pressure -based delivery 
system to expand the annulus frame.  The product name remains  the same.  
The trial delivery system is designed to introduce the trial  valve to the surgical site after 
removal of the diseased native leaflets. A delivery system is available for each size of the trial valve and consists of the following components:  
Model 8300DCA Delivery System  
• Balloon Introducer  
• Insertion Tool  
• Distal Handle  
• Frame Expansion Balloon Catheter

1.2.2  MODEL 8300DCA/DCD  DELIVERY SYSTEM  DIFFER ENCES   
All modifications to Model 8300DC D delivery system were to enhance device safety, 
ease of use and manufacturability.  The delivery system includes an integrated balloon 
catheter and tubular handle shaft through which the catheter extends. The major change 
was the distal handle is now incorporated into the balloon catheter as a one -piece 
design in the modified delivery sys tem and this modification provides one less 
component for the end user to assemble. The distal end of the handle shaft includes an adapter, which mates with the holder of the valve, and a locking sleeve for rapidly connecting the delivery system to the val ve holder. The balloon portion of the delivery 
system resides within the adapter, and advances distally into position for expanding the frame. A tubular balloon introducer sleeve, attached when removing the valve from a storage jar, facilitates passage of the balloon through the valve.  The malleable handle is 
made of aluminum and has chromate conversion coating applied over the entire surface 
of the part.

6.2.4 VISIT WINDOWS  
Visits must be scheduled for specific times before and after the date of the index 
procedure.  It is important that this schedule is maintained for all subject s.  To facilitate 
compliance, each visit has a visit window as described in Table 1  below.  Visits not 
completed within these windows will be considered “done out of window.”  Additional  
visits completed will be considered unscheduled visits.  Trial visits should be scheduled 
as close to the early part of the visit window as possible so that if it is necessary to 
cancel and reschedule the visit, the visit may still be conducted with in the required visit 
window . 
Table 1:  Follow -up Visit Days & Visit Windows  
Visit  Visit  Window  (Days)  Timing from Implant (Day 0) 
POD  195* - 15/+45  Day 180 to Day 24 0

Lab or an implant -related new or worsened cardiac conduction disturbance.  
 
 
6.3 SUBJECT  WITHDRAWAL  
Subject s may voluntarily withdraw consent at any time during the clinical trial without 
jeopardizing their medical care.  In addition, t he Investigator, the IRB and or Edwards 
Lifesciences has the right to withdraw subject s from the trial for the following reasons: 
when continuation may jeopardize the health of the subject , protocol violations, adverse 
events or concurrent conditions, administrative or other reasons.   
Subject s who withdraw from the trial for any reason will not be replaced  
.

6.4 SUBJECT  REMOVAL FROM CLINICAL TRIAL  
Although all subject s are informed of their right to withdraw from the clinical trial at any 
time, it is anticipated that such withdrawals will be infrequent.  All measures should be 
taken by the Investigator and his/her staff to encourage subject s to return for required 
follow- up visits.  The clinical trial objectives may be jeopardized if large numbers of 
subject s are lost to follow -up. 
All subject s are expected to continue in the trial until the Sponsor notifies the Investigator 
in writing that further follow -up is no longer required, except in the event of death or upon 
the subject ’s written request for early withdrawal from the clinical trial.   A copy of such 
request s will be kept with the source documentation.   
A subject  will be considered “ lost to follow -up” and terminated from the trial when all of 
the following criteria are met:  
 Failure to complete two consecutive visits without due cause  
 Documentation of three unsuccessful attempts on three different dates over a 
period of at least 1 month by the Investigator or designee to contact the subject  
or next of kin.  
All subjects who receive a commercial (a non- trial) heart valve and any subjects who 
have the EDWARDS INTUITY heart valve explanted will be followed through the end of 
the trial.  Subjects previously exited from the trial due to receiving a commercial valv e (at 
any time point) will be contacted and a request will be made to have them re- consented 
and reenrolled in the trial and followed through the end of the trial.

6.5 TRIAL  TERMINATION  
If the Sponsor and/or the Principal Investigator should discover c onditions arising during 
the trial that indicate that the trial  should be terminated prematurely, an appropriate 
schedule for termination will be instituted.  All trial subject s enrolled at the time the trial  is 
terminated,  will be followed by the Clinical Investigator for a period of five (5) years from 
the date of enrollment.  
The trial plan includes continued annual follow -up until 5 years of follow up are 
completed on all subjects enrolled in the clinical  trial.   
 
6.6 INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE MANAGEMENT  
At the time of this protocol revision, all subjects were enrolled in the trial.  Unused 
devices were returned  to the Sponsor and investigational device reconciliation was 
complete.  For a description of investigational device management, please refer to a previous version (Revision N) of the TRANSFORM
TM Protocol  
 
7.0 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Safety assessments will inc lude examination and reporting of adverse events, ECGs, 
laboratory parameters , vital signs and any change s from baseline.  
Adverse events, whether observed by the Investigator or reported by the subject , will be 
recorded on the Adverse Event CRF.  At each v isit, the Investigator or designee will 
determine whether any adverse events occurred by evaluating the subject .  Adverse 
events may be observed directly, reported spontaneously, or  identified  by questioning 
the subject  at each trial visit.  Questioning subject s should be in a general way, without 
asking about the occurrence of any specific symptoms.   The Investigator must appraise 
all trial related laboratory values . The Investigator should follow subject s with adverse 
events until the event has resolved or the condition has stabilized.

Pre-existing medical conditions or symptoms reported prior to device implant  will not be 
recorded as an AE. In the event there is worsening of a pre -existing medical condition or 
symptoms following the index procedure, then an AE must be recorded.  The adverse 
event report should note the existence of pre- index procedure history  when appropriate.  
7.1 SAFETY PROCESS  
The Safety Process in the TRANSFORMTM Trial has been established with three (3) 
levels of independent review of reported clinical outcomes (Adverse Events; AE) 
conducted by Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), Sponsor’s Safety Department (HVT 
Safety), and an independent Clinical Endpoints Committ ee (CEC).  
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC):  The DMC provided  a consistent, independent 
review of clinical outcomes reported in TRANSFORMTM trial during the enrollment 
period, The Committee will also review the data at the end of the study follow -up. The 
DMC reviews data reported from the sites, along with CEC -adjudicated data and Echo 
Core Lab data, and identifies any potential safety issues such as higher than expected 
SAE and/or death rates, Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADE), or 
hemodynamic perf ormance that is substantially worse than expected, to determine if the 
trial should be stopped, suspended, or modified at any time, as specified in the DMC 
Charter.  
Sponsor’s Safety Department (HVT Safety):   HVT Safety provides an initial review of 
new adv erse events directly following notification that an event has occurred.   The 
review includes  a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and UADE assessment and reporting to 
the relevant regulatory or trial groups, within the appropriate time frame, in accordance 
with the applicable regulatory requirements  which include, 21 CFR Part 812 
(Investigational Device Exemptions), 21 CFR Part 814 (Premarket Approval of Medical Devices), MEDDEV 2.7/3 (Clinical Investigations: Serious Adverse Event Reporting, 
2010), and ISO 14155:2011 (Clinical Investigation of Medical Devices for Human 
Subjects), as well as with the Sponsor’s internal standard operating procedures.

Clinical Endpoints Committee (CEC):   The primary role of the CEC is to review 
(adjudicate) and decide on safety endpoints which will be included in the final analysis. 
The adjudication process and the events selection is based on the approved study 
endpoints definitions and the CEC Charter. HVT Safety may also include events 
determined to be possibly related to a saf ety endpoint during their initial review of the 
event. Events designated as requiring CEC review are forwarded with relevant source 
documentation to the CEC by HVT Safety. The CEC can also identify additional events, not previously reported, during their r eview. These events will also be adjudicated.  
7.2 ADVERSE EVENTS  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended 
disease or injury, or untoward clinical event in a subject , whether or not related to the 
investigational medical device.   Note: A procedure is not an AE, but the reason for the 
procedure may be an AE.  
7.3 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
A serious adverse event (SAE) , defined as an event that leads to one of the following:  
• death;  
• a serious deterioration in the health of the trial  subject  that:  
o Results in life -threatening illness or injury;  
o Results in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function;  
o Requires in- subject  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
o Results in medical or surgical intervention to prevent  life-threatening illness or 
injury or  permanent impairment;  
• Congenital defect or anomaly  
Note:  Elective hospitalizations for pre- treatme nt conditions (e.g., elective cosmetic 
procedures , cataract removal ) are not serious adverse events ( SAE) . 
Each AE/SAE is considered to be either anticipated or unanticipated as described below.

7.4 ANTICIPATED ADVERSE EVENTS 
As with all prosthetic heart valves, serious complications, sometimes leading to death, 
are associated with the use of tissue valves as well as the replacement procedure.  In addition, complications due to individual subject  reaction to an implanted device, or to 
physical or chemical components, particularly those of biological origin, may occur at 
varying intervals (hours or days) necessitating reoperation and replacement of the 
prosthetic device.  
Known risks associated with the use of stented bioprostheti c heart valves include:  
• Allergic reaction to valve materials  
• Angina 
• Annulus (damage, dissection, tear)  
• Aortic Insufficiency – Regurgitation/Stenosis

/sutures or pannus)  
– Subject  Prosthesis Mismatch (PPM) (due 
to inappropriate sizing)  
– Distortion at implant  
• Valve - Structural dysfunction/deterioration 
(e.g., wear, leaflet tear, calcification, leaflet 
detachment from stent posts, component 
deterioration – physical or chemical)  
• Valve  - Thrombosis

7.5 UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECT  
An unanticipated adverse device effect  (UADE)  is defined as any serious adverse event 
on health and safety, or any life- threatening problem or death caused by, or associated 
with, this device, if that event, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, 
severity,  or degree of incidence i n the i nvestigational plan, or application.   Additionally, 
an unanticipated adverse event includes any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subject s. 
The Investigator must submit to the Sponsor or its designee and to the reviewing IRB, a 
report of any UADE  occurring during this clinical investigation as soon as possible, but 
under no circumstance, later than 10 working days after the Investigator first learns of 
the event.  Full and c omplete written documentation must follow this report.  The 
Investigator must document all UADE, including the time and date of onset, complete 
description of the event, severity, duration, actions taken and outcome.  Record all UADE on the appropriate CRF.  
The Sponsor will immediately conduct an evaluation of any unanticipated device- related 
event .  In addition, the Sponsor will notify the DMC  of an UADE within five ( 5) business 
days after Edwards or its designee first receives notice of the event .   
7.6 ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS/  REPORTABLE EVENTS  
Since assessment of safety requires  comparison of the occurrence of adverse events to 
the OPC, it is extremely important to provide definitions of adverse events and to adhere 
to these definitions.  The method of reporting shall conform to the  most recently 
published “ Guidelines for reporting mortality and mor bidity  after cardiac valve 
interventions ” by Akins et al  [14]. 
In addition, it is of utmost importance to determi ne the primary event since s econdary 
morbid events will not be included in the calculation of any complication rates . However, 
secondary events  will be reported for informational purposes.  For example, if a subject  
has endocarditis and develops a PVL  seco ndary to the infection, the PVL  will not be 
counted in the PVL rate.  The endocarditis will be included in the calculation of the 
endocarditis rate.

Edwards  
 
 
Multiple events of the same complication in the same subject  will be counted as a single 
event if the co mplication does not resolve.  For example, if a subject  experiences 
multiple TIA s in a two-week  period, only one event will be included in the linearized rate, 
although all events will be reported as a cluster.  Similarly, if a subject  exhibits a PVL at 
six months, and that leak remains at the POD  365-415 visit, only one event will be 
included in the linearized rate calculation.  If, however, a subject  has a stroke and then 6 
months later experiences another stroke, both events will be included in the calculation 
of the linearized stroke  rate. 
MORTALITY R EPORTING : 
In the event of subject death, every  effort should be made to obtain a copy of the 
autopsy report and/or death summary.  The Investigator will provide information about 
the cause of death and will determine relationship to the clinical investigational device.  The Clinical Events Committee ( CEC) will adjudicate each death for device relatedness 
and procedure relatedness.  The site will send the Sponsor copies of an autopsy report, if available, and/or a death summary.  
If explant of a device occurs during autopsy, return the device to the Spon sor for 
analysis.  Return kits for explanted devices will be provided upon request by the clinical 
site manager.

EXPLANT  REPORTING : 
In the event a trial valve is explanted in the late post -operative period, the Investigator 
will provide information o n the explant and determine the relationship to the trial valve.  
Every effort should be made to supply copies of available explant reports, to the 
Sponsor.  As soon as possible, explanted trial valves should be returned to the Sponsor 
for analysis.  Spons or will provide “return kits” for explanted devices upon request by the 
clinical site manager.  
A complete list of Adverse Event Definitions / Reportable Events  is located in XXX.  
7.7 ASSESSMENT OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
The Investigator at each participating site is ultimately responsible for reporting AEs  and 
complications .  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determination of 
the AE description while adhering to the provided definitions.  The Investigator is 
required to complete the adverse event case report form (Adverse Event CRF see 
xxxxx) at each trial visit.  The Adverse Event CRF for a given visit must report all 
adverse events that occurred since the last documented visit . 
Description o f each AE must be as follows: AE description, the date of onset, date of 
resolution, serious (yes/no; see Section 7 .2), frequency of the event (single episode, 
intermittent, continuous), action taken (none, medical and/or surgical), relationship to 
device, relationship to the procedure, and seriousness criteria.  
 
CAUSALITY:  
The causal relationship of the AE  to the device an d the procedure should be rated as 
follows:  
• Not Related: Evidence exists that the adverse event definitely has a cause other than 
the trial procedure or device (e.g. , pre-existing condition or underlying disease, 
intermittent  illness, or concomitant medication) and does not meet any other criteria 
listed.   There is no relationship  between the event and the device or procedure.

• Related: Evidence exists that the trial device or procedure caused the adverse event.  
There is a temporal relationship between the event onset and trial  device or 
procedure.  The subject ’s clinical state and concomitant therapies are  ruled out as a 
cause.  
• Unknown: There is no evidence or relevant  data available to assess the relationship 
between the event and the device or procedure.  
 
Adverse event outcome defined as follows:  
• Recovered/Resolved (the subject  fully recovered from the adverse event with no 
residual effect observed).  
• Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae (the residual effects of the adverse event are still 
present and observable).  
• Ongoing (The adverse event itself is still present and observable) . 
• Death. 
• Explant . 
•  Ongoing at the time of trial exit  
• Chronic Condition ( e.g., Cancer , Shingles, Herpes)   
Action Taken for Event  (identify all that apply) : 
• None (no treatment was required) . 
• Medication required (prescription and/or over the counter medication was required to 
treat the adverse event.  
• Hospitalization or Prolongation of Hospitalization Required (hospitalization was 
required or prolonged due to the adverse event ) 
• Surgical intervention (not involving the trial valve)  
• Reoperation or explant of the trial valve  
• Other  (specify) .

7.8 ELECTROCARDIOGRAMS  
An ECG will be performed with the subject  in supine position at , POD 180- 240 (optional) , 
and annually  thereafter until the trial ends .  An expert cardiologist knowledgeable in 
cardiac conduction disturbances will determine the cardiac rhythm, and assess the ECG 
as normal or abnormal, and will specify any clinically significant abnormal findings.   
Any n ew or worsened cardiac conduction dist urbance  defined as new or worsened first 
degree atrioventricular (AV) block, second degree AV block (Mobitz I or Mobitz II), third 
degree AV block, incomplete right bundle branch block, right bundle branch block,  
intraventricular conduction delay, left bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, 
or left posterior fascicular block will be reported.  
7.9 LABORA TORY  TESTING  
Blood data (red blood count, white blood count, hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet count, and plasma -free hemoglobin or haptoglobin or serum LDH ) will be collected POD  180-
240 (optional) , POD  365-435, and annually thereafter until the trial  ends . 
For all measured blood parameters, individual results will be compared to documented normal ranges .  The Investigator will determine for each parameter that is out -of-range 
whether the value is abnormal not clinically significant , or abnormal clinically significant.   
Since summary statistics involving laboratory parameters will be provided, an out -of-
range value does not neces sarily constitute an AE; other signs and symptoms must be 
taken into an account in order to report the occurrence of an AE.  
Coagulation profile (which may include prothrombin time [PT], or partial thromboplastin 
time [PTT], or international normalized rat io [INR]) will be collected at the POD  180-240 
(optional visit) and annually thereafter , coagulation profile will only  be determined for 
subject s on anticoagulant therapy.

8.0 EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENTS  
8.1 PERI -PROCEDURAL PARAMETERS  
Device technical success was  defined as the successful delivery and deployment of 
the trial valve with maximum of two attempts and subject leaving the OR with valve in 
place.  In addition, cross -clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass times, and length of 
stay in  the ICU will be documented.  
Procedural success was  defined as device technical success followed by the 
absence of adverse events resulting in device reoperation implant of permanent pacemaker (with baseline sinus rhythm and no other pre- existing conduction issues), 
or valve- related death within discharge or 10 days post index procedure, whichever 
comes first.  
8.2 NYHA CLASSIFICATION 
The percentage of subjects in each specific NYHA functional class and the change in 
NYHA classifications  from screening will be analyzed at each time point where NYHA is 
obtained to evaluate if implanting the trial valve  results in an improvement in NYHA 
classification.   
8.3 HEMODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE  
Echocardiography will be conducted at POD  180-240 (optional) , POD  365-435 and 
annually thereafter until the trial  ends .  The Echocardiography Core Lab Manual is 
provided in XXX for specific information regarding the conduct of these procedures.     
 The echo core lab will determine: peak systolic and mean aortic valve gradient, EOA, 
EOA index, performance index, cardiac output, cardiac index, valvular regurgitation 
(including paravalvular leak) , left and right atrial size, left and right ventricular size, left 
and right ventricular function, ventricular septal and left ventricular posterior wall 
thickness, cavitary thrombi or other masses, pericardial abnormalities (e.g., effusion) and 
aortic root diameter.

9.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
The following section describes only those activities that will be conducted after the 
approval of the study product. All detailed analyses conducted for the PMA submission are XXXX and a xxxx all post approval analys es. 
 
9.1 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
9.1.1 ANALYSIS POPULATION 
There will be two analysis populations for the trial: the enrolled or intent -to-treat 
population and the valve implant or as -treated population. The valve implant population 
will include all subjects who receive the trial valve and leave the operating room  with the 
trial valve in place .   
The valve implant population will be used for all analyses of NYHA and echocardiographic data.  
9.1.2 SAFETY ANALYSIS 
The analyses of the safety data will be performed for enrolled (ITT) patients and all valve 
implant (as -treated) patients.  However, the primary analysis population for all safety 
analys es will be the valve implant (as -treated) population.  
9.1.2.1 Primary Safety Endpoints  
For the safety endpoints listed in Section 2.1 , the early adverse event s within 30 days of 
implant will be reported as the number of events divided by the number of patients for 
the events .  Linearized rates will be used to summarize adverse events for the late (>30 
days) post -operative period.  The linearized rates will be calculated as the number of late 
events divided by the total late- patient years.  
Actuarial analysis using the Kaplan- Meier method will be used to estimate the probability 
of freedom from each primary safety endpoint. Primary analyses of the primary safety endpoints (post 30 days) will be based on linearized rates, which account for multiple

events from a single patient. Actuarial (Kaplan- Meier) analysis of the time to first event 
per patient will be provided as an additional analysis.  
9.1.2.2 Other Safety Data  
Percentages for the early events and linearized rates for the late events will  be 
calculated for all complications.   If valve malposition, valve instability, valve 
dislodgement or valve migration/embolization occurs, any consequent adverse events or 
procedures (e.g. coronary ostia blockage, mitral valve impingement, or abrasion, 
intraoperative intervention, or reoperation) will be noted and rates presented.  
 
9.1.3 EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS 
 
Subjects will be analyzed according to the NYHA classification preoperatively, at POD 
31-46, POD 90 -135, and annually post implant for 5 years.  The distribution (numbers of 
subjects and percentages) in the various NYHA classes and the change from baseline 
(improved, same and wors e) will be tabulated and stratified by baseline NYHA at each 
follow- up interval. Echocardiography data will be obtained preoperatively, 
intraoperatively, at discharge, POD 90 -135, POD 180- 240 (optional)  and annually post 
implant until the trial ends .  Desc riptive statistics for the continuous echo variables (e.g. 
mean, standard deviation, and range) will be categorized by time interval and valve size.  
Regurgitation data will be summarized by counts and percentages at each severity level.  
A comparison of al l effectiveness data for the EDWARDS  INTUITY valve will be made to 
current state of the art pr osthetic heart valve literature  published in peer reviewed 
journals at the time of PMA submission.  
9.1.4 OTHER OUTCOMES ANALYSIS  
The change in Short Form 12 version 1 (SF- 12v2) Quality of Life questionnaire from 
screening to 1 year will be summarized by N, mean, and standard deviation.

Blood data will be analyzed to determine if significant subclinical and unreported 
hemolysis is occurring due to the implant of the trial  valve.  A trend analysis of two 
postoperative data points will be conducted to determine if hemolysis is increasing over 
time.  The following parameters will be included in the trend analysis: plasma- free 
hemoglobin, haptoglobin, serum LDH , hem oglobin and hematocrit.   
For all measured blood parameters, individual results will be compared to documented 
normal ranges.  The Investigator will determine for each parameter that is out -of-range 
whether the value is abnormal not clinically significant or abnormal clinically significant 
and summary statistics will be provided.   
9.1.5 MISSING DATA  
All statistical tests on the effectiveness  endpoints will be performed using only those 
subject s with available data required for endpoint analysis.  No missin g value imputation 
will be performed.

13.3 MONITORING METHODS   
The Sponsor has established procedures for monitoring clinical investigations to assure 
the quality of the trial  and to assure that each person involved in the monitoring process 
carries out his or her duties. Standardized written procedures, sufficiently detailed to 
cover the general aspects of clinical investigations, will be used as a basic monitoring 
plan and will be supplemented by more specific or additional procedures, as required by 
the clinical investigation. A pre- investigation “Qualification Visit” was conducted to 
ensure that the Investigator clearly  understood  and accept ed the obligations incurred in 
undertaking the clinical investigation as set forth in 21 CFR 56 and 21 CFR 812, and that 
the facilities are acceptable throughout the clinical investigation. Onl y qualified 
investigational sites participated  in the trial. Periodic monitoring visits will be conducted 
with adequate frequency to ensure that the Investigator’s obligations as set forth in 21 CFR 56 and 21 CFR 812 are being fulfilled and that the facili ties continue to be 
acceptable. The Sponsor assigns a monitor to oversee the progress of the clinical 
investigation at each investigational center. The monitor will remain in close contact with 
each investigational center throughout the duration of the inv estigation to provide any 
needed materials, (i.e., investigation forms) and answer any questions.  The monitor will be responsible for verifying that the subject signed the consent, reviewing all data 
recorded on the eCRFs  (100% source data verification) , and visiting each investigational 
center periodically to observe trial progress and compliance with clinical protocol and 
regulations applicable to this clinical investigation.  
Monitoring visits will be scheduled throughout the duration of the clinical in vestigation 
between the monitor and the Principal Investigator at a mutually convenient and available time. These visits will assure that the facilities are still acceptable, the protocol 
and investigational plan are being followed, the IRB is notified of approved protocol 
changes as required, complete records are being maintained, appropriate timely reports 
(incl. AEs, SAEs and UADEs) are made to the Sponsor and IRB, and device inventory is 
controlled and the Investigator is carrying out all agreed upon  activities. Any personnel 
changes must be reported to the monitor immediately and a training program must be scheduled and documented. Additionally, the monitor will perform 100%  source data

13.3.1 MONITORING VISITS  
Periodic monitoring visits will be made at all trial centers in accordance with center 
enrollment rates. Trial centers should be visited a minimum of once each year by the 
monitor.  
Upon termination or conclusion of the clinical investigation, the monitor will perform a 
close -out visit  to ensure that all clinical trial materials and patient data are properly 
documented and returned to the Sponsor.

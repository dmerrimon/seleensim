  2. Protocol Synopsis  
Postmarket Study PS120081:  A Prospective, Non -Randomized, Parallel 
Cohort, Multi -Center Study of Xenform vs. Native Tissue for the 
Treatment of Women with Ante rior/Apical Pelvic Organ Prolapse  
Study 
Objective(s) The purpose of this study is to compare transvaginal repair with a 
biologic graft to traditional native tissue repair in women surgically 
treated for anterior and/or apical pelvic organ prolapse.   This study is 
being conducted in partnership with the American Urogynecologic 
Society (AUGS) under the Pelvic Floor Disorders Outcome Registry 
(PFD Registry).   
Test Device  Xenform Soft Tissue Repair Matrix biologic graft (“Xenform”)  
Control Device  Tradi tional native repair (sacrospinous ligament fixation or uterosacral 
ligament suspension and/or colporrhaphy)  
Study Design  Non-randomized, parallel cohort, multi -center study.   
All procedures will be standardized for uniformity.  Physicians will 
have to document a minimum of 10 procedures with either Xenform or 
a similar biologic graft or with native tissue repair prior to study 
participation in order to document competency and e xperience.  
Physician training, specialty, and site procedure location (such as 
private -practice, hospital, academic medical center, etc.) will be 
recorded.  
Concomitant procedures including anterior and posterior vaginal wall 
repair, hysterectomy, and sli ng placement for stress urinary 
incontinence may be performed, per physician discretion.  Sling 
placement can include a synthetic material, however a concomitant 
anterior or posterior repair cannot include a biologic graft or a synthetic 
implant.  An anter ior colporrhaphy may be required for cystocele repair, 
if clinically necessary.  All concomitant procedures performed will be 
recorded.  
Subjects who undergo a medical intervention (surgical or non -surgical) 
to treat recurrence, persistence of pelvic organ  prolapse or a treatment 
complication will be followed to 36 months from the initial study 
procedure .   
Planned 
Number of 
Subjects  Approximately 454 subjects enrolled (227 subjects per arm).  Eligible 
control subjects meeting the study inclusion/exclusion criteria may be 
shared from the PFD Registry.

Primary 
Effectiveness 
Endpoint(s)  The primary endpoint of the study is to achieve non -inferiority of 
transvaginal repair with Xenform over native tissue repair at 36 months 
as compared to baseline.  Success will be based on a composite of 
objective and subjective measures, and subjects wil l be considered a 
surgical success if each of the three criteria is met:   
1. Subjective success is achieved if patient denies symptoms of 
vaginal bulging per PFDI -20 question 3, answering “no” or “yes” 
but “Not at all” bothersome (<2)   
2. Anatomic success (in the operated compartment)  
• Anterior Segment:  Leading edge of prolapse is at or above 
the hymen or POP -Q point Ba ≤ 0    
• Apical Segment: The vaginal apex does not descend more 
than one -half into the vaginal canal (i.e. POP -Q point C ˂  
-1/2 TVL) for multi- compartment prolapse or POP -Q point 
C ≤ 0 for prolapse of the apical compartment alone   
3. No retreatment for POP:  No additional surgical treatment for 
POP in the segment(s) of the vagina treated at the index surgery 
or no pessary use si nce index surgery (i.e., ‘treated segment’ 
refers to the target compartments in this study, which are the 
anterior and apical compartments)  
Primary Safety 
Endpoint(s)  A co -primary endpoint of the study is to achieve non -inferiority of 
Xenform to native ti ssue repair for safety by comparing rates of serious 
device or serious procedure related complications between baseline and 
the 36 month time point.  Serious injury is defined per 21 CFR 803.3, 
i.e., life threatening, results in permanent impairment of a b ody function 
or permanent damage to a body structure, or injury or illness that 
requires medical or surgical intervention to preclude impairment of a 
body function or permanent damage to a body structure.

Statistical Methods   
Primary 
Statistical 
Hypothesis  Transvaginal repair with Xenform will be non -inferior to traditional 
native tissue repair in effectiveness and non -inferior in safety.   
Non-inferiority testing for effectiveness will be performed for the 
primary hypothesis.    
Statistical testing will be performed to determine if composite endpoint 
of anatomic and symptomatic success rate in transvaginal biologic 
repair (treatment) group w ill be non -inferior to traditional native tissue 
repair (control) group.  The null hypothesis is that the success rate in 
treatment group is less than or equal to the success rate in control group 
minus margin:  
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 −𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐  ≤− ∆   
The alternative hypothesis is:  
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 − 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐> − ∆     
where 𝜋𝜋 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡   and 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 are the success rate in treatment group 
and control group respectively, and ∆ >0 is defined as the non -
inferiority m argin.  
Statistical testing will be performed to determine if the serious device -
related or serious procedure -related complication rate of treatment 
group is non -inferior to the control group. The null hypothesis is that the 
complication rate in treatment group is greater than or equal to the rate 
in control group plus margin:  
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 −𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐  ≥∆   
The alternative hypothesis is:  
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 −𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 <∆   
where 𝜋𝜋 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡   and 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 are the overall complication rate in 
treatment group and control group respectively, and ∆ >0 is defined as 
the non- inferiority margin.  
Statistical Test 
Method  All statistical analyses will be performed by Boston Scientific  per the 
Statistical Analysis Plan.  All analyses will be done using SAS (version 
8.0 or higher) statistical software.  Subject summary tables and data 
listings will be provided for the data collected.

Sample Size 
Parameters  The statistical power calculation is based on a non -inferiority 
assumption with a binary primary outcome. Success, based on a 
composite endpoint of anatomic and symptomatic success at 36 month 
is assumed to be 70%5-8, 16 for the native tissue arm.   With type I error 
of 0.05 and type II error of 0.20 (power 80%), 362 subjects (181 
subjects per arm) are needed to detect non -inferiority of transvaginal 
biologic to native tissue repair, using a margin of 12.0%.   
To assess for safety, the overall complication rate (i.e., serious device -
related or serious procedure -related adverse events) is anticipated to be 
approximately 14%.9  With type I error of 0.05 and type II error of 0.10 
(power 90%), 308 subjects (154 subjects per arm) are needed to detect 
non-inferiority with a margin of 11 .6%.   
The rate of device or procedure related de novo dyspareunia is 
anticipated to be approximately 9%.17  With type I error of 0.05 and 
type II error of 0.20 (power 80%), 326 subjects (163 subjects per arm) 
are needed to detect non -inferiority with a ma rgin of 7.9%. 
The rate of device or procedure related AE incidence (pelvic pain, 
infection, vaginal shortening, atypical vaginal discharge, neuromuscular 
problems, vaginal scarring, de novo vaginal bleeding, fistula formation 
and/or de novo voiding dysfunc tion) is anticipated to be approximately 
12%.15-18  With type I error of 0.05 and type II error of 0.20 (power 
80%), 330 subjects (165 subjects per arm) are needed to detect non-
inferiority with a margin of 8.9%.  
To assess for office- based interventions f or complications, the rate is 
anticipated to be approximately 2%.9 With type I error of 0.025 and 
type II error of 0.10 (power 90%), 330 subjects (165 subjects per arm) 
are needed to detect non -inferiority with a margin of 5%.    
To assess for surgical intervention for complications, the rate is 
anticipated to be approximately 1%.9  With type I error of 0.025 and 
type II error of 0.10 (power 90%), 260 subjects (130 subjects per arm) 
are needed to detect non -inferiority with a margin of 4%.    
Non-surgical subjects will not be enrolled in this study as all data on 
this cohort of subjects will be obtained from the AUGS PFD Registry 
and analyzed with data from this clinical study.  
Assuming a 20% loss to follow -up rate, a total of 454 subjects (227 per 
study arm) will be enrolled to achieve the primary endpoint of success 
at 36 months.

  4. Introduction  
Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) of the anterior and posterior vaginal wall, and vaginal apex, are 
among the most challenging and common aspects of traditional pelvic reconstructive surgery.  
As life expectancy increases, significantly greater numbers of women will present with POP 
and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) requiring surgical intervention.  Women face an 11% 
lifetime risk of requiring major surgery for POP.3   
The main goal of POP surgery is restoration of normal anatomy to achieve proximal vaginal 
suspension, mid- vaginal lateral attachments and distal vaginal fusion to the urogenital fascia 
and perineum.  Women undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery for POP hope to achieve 
relief of symptoms, restoration of normal anatomy, maintenance of vaginal ca pacity for 
sexual function and improvement in the quality of life.  
The difficulties associated with repair of cystocele were cited by Ahfelt as early as 1909, and 
reinforced nearly a century later by Weber et al. (2001) who reported recurrence rates as hig h 
as 70% in a widely cited randomized controlled study (RCT).4  Clark et al. estimated that up 
to 60% of surgical recurrences occur at the same anatomic site as the original repair, 
highlighting the limitations associated with plicating and/or suspending w eakened connective 
tissues to one another.1  In recent years, surgical methods such as vaginal mesh repair (VMR) 
have become available as an option for treating more advanced and challenging cases. 
Biologic grafts like Xenform offer potential advantages ov er synthetic meshes.  These 
include the capability for in- vivo tissue remodeling and consequent reduction in the rates of 
extrusion and/or erosion10.  Goldstein, et al.2 studied Xenform and showed an 88% success 
rate when patients were followed for one (1)  year.  
5. Device Description 
Xenform Soft Tissue Repair Matrix is intended for use as a soft tissue patch to reinforce soft 
tissue where weakness exists and for the surgical repair of damaged or ruptured soft tissue 
membranes.  Xenform is specifically indicat ed for the repair of colon, rectal, urethral and 
vaginal prolapse, and procedures such as sacrocolposuspenstion and urethral sling.  
Xenform is derived from fetal bovine dermis.  It is predominantly Type I and Type III 
collagen.  Other versions of the same processed fetal bovine dermal material have been used 
to treat over 250,000 patients in soft tissue repair applications, including repair/replacement 
of the dura, repair/reinforcement of tendons, wound closure, hernia repair and general plastic 
and recons tructive surgery. 
When hydrated, Xenform is pliable, strong and tissue -compatible because it is derived from 
animal tissue.  Xenform is not chemically cross -linked like some other biologic grafts but 
relies on the inherent strength of the bovine dermis from which it is derived.  It is easily 
vascularized and is thought to remodel into a native tissue -like structure.  
Xenform has been used in over 30,000 patients, worldwide, and there have been no 
complaints of tissue erosion, tissue perforation, or infect ion to- date.

  6. Study Objectives  
The primary objective is to evaluate clinical effectiveness of transvaginal repair with 
Xenform against traditional native tissue repair in women surgically treated for anterior 
and/or apical pelvic organ prolapse.  Secondary objectives are to evaluate Xenform -related 
complications and subject reported outcomes.   
7. Study Endpoints  
7.1. Primary Endpoint s 
The primary endpoint of the study is to achieve non- inferiority of transvaginal repair with 
Xenform over native tissue repair at 36 months as compared to baseline.   
Success will be based on a composite of objective and subjective measures, and subjects will 
be considered a surgical success if each of the three criteria is met :   
1. Subjective success is achieved if the patient denies symptoms of vaginal bulging per 
PFDI -20 question 3, answering “no” or “yes” but “Not at all” bothersome (<2).  
2. Anatomic success (in the operated compartment) : 
• Anterior segment:  Leading edge of anterior prolapse is at or above the hymen 
or POP -Q point Ba ≤ 0.  
• Apical segment:  The vaginal apex does not descend more than one -half into 
the vaginal canal (i.e. POP -Q point C < - 1/2 TVL) for multi -compartment 
prolapse or POP-Q point C ≤ 0 for single compartment apical prolapse.  
3. No retreatment for POP:  No additional surgical treatment for POP in the segment(s) 
of the vagina treated at the index surgery or no pessary use since index surgery (i.e., 
‘treated segment’ refers to the target compartments in this study, which are the 
anterior and apical compartments) . 
Addi tionally, a co -primary endpoint of the study is to achieve non- inferiority of transvaginal 
repair with Xenform to native tissue repair for safety by comparing rates of serious device or 
serious procedure related complications between baseline and the 36 mo nth time point. 
Serious injury is defined per 21 CFR 803.3, i.e., life threatening, results in permanent 
impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure or injury or illness 
that requires medical or surgical intervention to preclude impairment of a body function or 
permanent damage to a body structure .  
7.2. Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints of the study include assessments of complications and subject 
reported outcomes:  
1. Incidence of mesh erosion  
2. Incidence of mesh exposure

  3. Incidence of de novo dyspareunia  
4. Improvement in subject -related outcomes at 36 months compared to Baseline ((pelvic 
floor symptoms (PFDI -20), QOL (PFIQ -7), sexual functioning (PISQ -12) TOMUS 
pain scale)  
5. Assessment of subject’s level of improvement, measured by the Patient Global 
Impression of Improvement for Prolapse (PGI -I for Prolapse)  
6. Absence of re- intervention and re -surgery for recurrence of POP, persistence of 
disease, or Xenform  exposure/erosion 
7.  Surgical success based on the following composite outc ome:  
a. Subjective success:  patient denies symptoms of vaginal bulging per PFDI -20 
question 3, answering “no” or “yes” but “Not at all” bothersome (<2)  
b. Anatomic success (in the operated compartment):  
• Anterior Segment:  No anterior prolapse at or beyond the hymen or 
POP-Q point Ba<0 
• Apical Segment:  The vaginal apex does not descend more than one -
half into the vaginal canal (i.e. , POP -Q point C ˂ 1/2 TVL) for multi -
compartment prolapse or POP -Q point C ˂ 0 for prolapse of the apical 
compartment alone . 
c. No retre atment for POP (treated segment):  No additional surgical treatment 
for POP in the segment(s) of the vagina treated at the index surgery or no 
pessary use since index surgery (‘treated segment’ refers to the target 
compartments in this study, which are the  anterior and apical compartments)  
8. Incidence of the following device or procedure -related AEs:  pelvic pain, infection, 
vaginal shortening, atypical vaginal discharge, neuromuscular problems, vaginal 
scarring, de novo vaginal bleeding, fistula formation and/or de novo voiding 
dysfunction  
8. Study Design  
This study is a prospective, non- randomized, parallel cohort, multi -center study conducted in 
partnership with the AUGS PFD Registry.   
The primary endpoint will be assessed once all per protocol subjects have completed the 36 
month study visit.  All per protocol subjects will be followed to month 36, until study 
completion, or until discontinuation prior to month 36.  All study procedures will be 
standardized for uniformity.  Prior to enrolling a subject, phy sicians must have completed a 
minimum of 10 procedures (defined for each arm) in order to document competency and 
experience.  For the native tissue arm, physicians must have completed a minimum of 10 
transvaginal anterior -apical prolapse repair procedures that incorporate an apical vault 
suspension utilizing either a uterosacral ligament suspension or sacrospinous ligament 
fixation.  For the Xenform arm, physicians must have completed a minimum of 10 native

  tissue repair procedures (as defined for the nati ve tissue arm) augmented with a biologic graft 
or Xenform, and the uterosacral and/or sacrospinous ligaments must be accessed via the 
anterior compartment incision.  Physician training, specialty, and site procedure location 
(such as private- practice, hosp ital, academic medical center, etc.) will be recorded.  
All efforts will be made to ensure all follow -up anatomic measurements (POP -Q) will be 
assessed by a healthcare provider to reduce surgeon bias on outcomes after the index 
procedure. In the event the treating surgeon is the only qualified healthcare provider at the 
site trained in POP -Q assessments, the follow -up anatomic measurements will be performed 
by the treating surgeon.  
All enrolled subjects will have an anterior and/or apical defect.  Concomitant procedures to 
treat a secondary defect can occur (including an anterior repair, posterior repair, 
hysterectomy, or sling placement for stress urinary incontinence) at the time of prolapse 
repair for the primary defect, per physician discretion.  Sling placement may include a 
synthetic material yet a concomitant anterior repair or posterior repair cannot include a 
biologic graft or a synthetic implant.  An anterior colporrhaphy may be required, if clinically 
necessary.  All concomitant procedures performed will be recorded.  
Subjects who undergo a medical intervention (surgical or non -surgical) to treat recurrence, 
persistence of POP, or Xenform or suture complication will be followed to month 36 from 
the initial study procedure.  
8.1. Scale and Duration  
The study will be conducted at up to 40 sites at a rate of approximately 2 subjects per site, 
per month.  Sites will be encouraged to enroll a minimum of 15 subjects and up to a 
maximum of 50 subjects.   
It is anticipated that approximately 454 subjects wi ll be enrolled in total to achieve 362 
subjects (181 subjects per treatment arm) for the primary endpoint analysis at 36 months 
post-surgery to achieve non -inferiority of repair with Xenform to native tissue repair for 
effectiveness by comparing rates based on a composite endpoint of anatomic and 
symptomatic success between baseline and the 36 month time point.  Due to the partnership 
with the PFD Registry, it is anticipated a portion of the control arm subjects will be shared 
from the Registry.   
The enrol lment period is expected to be approximately 12 to 18 months after the final study 
center has been permitted to enroll subjects.  A potential 20% “lost to follow -up” rate is 
anticipated.   
Once enrolled into the study, subjects will be followed to 36 months post -surgery to be 
evaluated for the primary endpoint analysis.  The total duration of each subject’s 
participation in the study is 36 months from time of procedure.  
Subjects who undergo a medical intervention (surgical or non -surgical) to treat recurre nce, 
persistence of POP, or Xenform or suture complication will be followed to 36 months, post 
the initial study procedure .

  8.2. Treatment Assignment  
This post -approval study is a prospective, non -randomized, parallel cohort study across 
multiple centers.  Sub jects will be screened against the study Inclusion/Exclusion criteria and 
if eligible, enrolled into the study after providing Informed Consent.   
Study centers will be selected by Boston Scientific  to perform the study procedure as either a 
treatment cent er or a control center, depending on experience to reduce selection bias.  Some 
study centers may be selected to enroll a combination of treatment and control subjects, 
depending on subject population and per Boston Scientific discretion.   
Treatment will occur after all Baseline procedures have been completed and the subject has 
been deemed eligible for the study.  Baseline procedures may be combined with the 
screening visit and may occur within three months prior to the study procedure, with 
confirmation of no evidence of infection prior to the procedure.  Due to the allowable 
window of up to three months between baseline and study procedure, the study staff will 
confirm that subjects are still electing to undergo the study surgery with confirmation of no 
evidence of infection.  
8.2.1. Treatment  
The treatment device in this study is the Xenform® Soft Tissue Repair Matrix (“Xenform”).  
Please refer to the Directions for Use document for device- specific information.  The 
Xenform surgical procedure will be standardized across all centers for uniformity through the 
application of step- by-step instructions for placement.  Physicians will be trained to the 
standardized procedure steps prior to the first study procedure being performed.  Minor 
modifications to the standardization may be necessary based on a physician’s practice and 
patient care . 
8.2.2. Control  
The control procedure in this study is traditional native tissue repair, which includes 
sacrospinous ligament fixation or uterosacral ligament suspension and/or anterior 
colporrhaphy.  The surgical procedure will be standardized, including suture type (delayed 
absorbable or permanent sutures). Sacrospinous ligament fixation may be performed if the 
uterosacral ligaments are deemed unusable due to scarring or inability to access.  
9. Subject Selection  
9.1. Study Population and Eligibility  
This study will enroll adult, non- pregnant women who have been diagnosed with anterior 
and/or apical pelvic organ prolapse and will undergo repair surgery, and who may or may not 
also undergo a conc omitant procedure (such as anterior repair, posterior repair, hysterectomy, 
or sling placement for stress urinary incontinence).  If a concomitant procedure were to occur 
at the time of the index prolapse repair, the sling placement should be a synthetic m aterial, 
however the concomitant anterior or posterior repair cannot include a biologic graft or

10. Subject Accountability  
10.1. Point of Enrollment  
Subjects will be considered enrolled in the study once an incision is made in the vaginal wall. 
All enrolled subjects will have been consented and assigned to receive either the treatment or 
control procedure per site assignment .  Per Boston Scientific’s d iscretion, a site may be 
considered for participation in both the treatment and control procedure arms however each 
physician must be designated to one arm only.  All enrolled subjects with a surgery initiated 
(i.e. incision in vagina) will be considered part of the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population for the 
final study analysis.  All ITT subjects who are treated with a study procedure and had no 
major protocol deviations will be considered part of the Per Protocol analysis.      
The following study timeline (see Table 10.1- 1) is based on milestones completed and the 
current follow -up visit cadence.

per site IRB, and/or other communication methods .   
10.2. Withdrawal  
All subjects enrolled in the clinical study (including those withdrawn from the clinical study 
or lost to follow -up) will be accounted for and documented. If a subject withdraws from the 
clinical investigation, the reason(s) will be recorded. Reasons for s tudy withdrawal may 
include voluntary withdrawal (withdrew consent), involuntary withdrawal, lost to follow -up, 
death or other reasons to be documented in the Case Report Form.     
10.2.1. Voluntary Withdrawal  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time.  At the time of withdrawal, the 
Investigator shall document the reason for the withdrawal. For subjects who withdraw from 
the study and decide to revoke their authorization to use and disclose their medical 
information, the information that has already been collected in the study record may continue 
to be used; however, no new information will be obtained or added.   
10.2.2. Involuntary Withdrawal  
Subjects may be involuntarily withdrawn from the study if the Investigator determines it is in 
the subject’s best interest .   
10.2.3. Lost to Follow -up 
Before a subject may be considered lost to follow -up the Investigator must make the 
following attempts to contact the subject:  
• Two documented telephone attempts  
• One certified letter  
If the subject is able to be reached and no longer  wishes to participate in the study the 
Investigator shall document the reason for the withdrawal and complete End of Study Case 
Report Form.  If the subject is not able to be reached after the required attempts to contact the 
subject are made and the subj ect has missed two consecutive follow -up visits within a 12 
month calendar period, the subject may be considered lost to follow -up.  The Investigator 
should document in the subject’s medical record the attempts to contact the subject and 
reason for the wit hdrawal. 
10.2.4. Subject Death 
Subjects may be withdrawn from the  study in the event of a death.  If any serious adverse 
event results in death  (regardless of the relatedness to the study device, procedure or pelvic 
floor) , the event is to be documented in the sou rce documentation, Case Report Form, and 
reported to Boston Scientific within the timeframe noted in Table 21.6- 1 (Investigator 
Reporting Requirements).  If an autopsy is conducted, a copy of the final autopsy report

  11.2. Study Candidate Screening  
Potential subjects will be identified by qualified staff at each selected study center as per 
their individual processes that will be documented at either the Site Qualification Visit and/or 
the Site Initiation Visit.   
Subjects will be screened against the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and if confirmed to 
meet all requirements will be eligible to be consented for enrollment into the study.   
Subjects who do not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria and/or are not enrolled into the 
study a re considered screening failures.  Information on screen failure subjects will be 
captured in the source documentation and screening logs and should include reasons for 
screen failure. 
11.3. Informed Consent  
Prior to any study- related assessments, each subject m ust sign an IRB -approved informed 
consent document to participate in the study as described in the Declaration of Helsinki and  
ISO 14155:2011 (Clinical investigation of medical devices for human subjects -  Good 
clinical practice) and will be in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.  The 
informed consent form will describe the planned and permitted uses, transfers, and 
disclosures of the subject’s personal health information. 
The subject or legally authorized representative (if approved by the  IRB)  will be given ample 
opportunity to inquire about details of the study to decide whether or not to participate in the 
study.  Copies of the informed consent form will be provided to the subject and original 
documents filed at each study center as per regulatory requirements.  
Once the subject voluntarily agrees to participate in the study, then the Study Visit Schedule 
will be followed per below and as outlined in Table 11.1- 1 (Data Collection Schedule) .

Subjects will be scheduled for follow -up visits as outlined in Table 11.1- 1 (Data Collection 
Schedule).  The follow -up visit schedule begins from the day of the study surgery and 
includes visit windows (counted in calendar days) . 
Every effort should be made to do the  follow -up visit within the window; however, if this is 
not possible, the site should attempt to complete the visit as soon as possible but before the 
next visit window opens.  Follow -up visits will be considered missed once the visit window 
for the next follow -up visit opens.  For the Month 36 visit, the visit is not considered missed 
until the last day of the visit window  (i.e., + 12 weeks) . 
Every effort should be made to conduct the follow -up visit at the study site location.  
However, if the subject cannot physically return to the site for any reason, the follow -up visit 
may be conducted at the subject’s home with their consent and if allowed by local 
institutional policy and the IRB/EC.  If a home visit is not possible, every effort should be 
made to conduct as much of the visit as possible by phone (i.e., assess adverse events, risk 
factors, and analgesic intake) and to send the subject questionnaires by mail for completion.

All subjects who have completed the study surgery and discharge will proceed to be followed 
through the above -outlined study visits to Month 36 where the primary endpoint analysis will 
be achieved when the last subject completes this visit.  All subjects completing the Month 36 
visit will be considered to have completed the study.   
11.5. Re-Intervention/Re- Surgery  
It is the intention of this study to demonstrate an improvement in anterior/apical pelvic organ 
prolapse through clinical e ffectiveness of transvaginal prolapse repair with Xenform.  
However, it is recognized that during the course of the study, there is a possibility subjects 
may require a medical re -intervention for events including but not limited to failed prolapse 
repair,  persistence of prolapse symptoms, or Xenform or procedure -related complication.  A 
re-intervention may include surgical or non- surgical treatments and can occur for a medical 
complication or for prolapse recurrence. For the purpose of this study surgical interventions 
shall be classified as “re- surgery” and non- surgical interventions shall be classified as “re-
interventions”.  Analyses will be performed to compare the rate of office -based interventions 
and of surgical interventions for medical complication s and for prolapse recurrence in both 
treatment groups. 
Non-surgical interventions (re -interventions) are defined as office- based procedures and do 
not involve an operating room procedure.  Examples of non- surgical interventions may 
include but are not lim ited to an office visit to trim exposed Xenform or suture in the vagina, 
a pessary, or physical therapy to treat procedural complications or persistent prolapse 
symptoms.  Data on non- surgical interventions will be captured in the CRFs.  Subjects will 
continue to be followed per the regular study visit schedule.   
Surgical interventions (re -surgery) are surgical operations performed to correct recurring 
prolapse symptoms, a procedural complication, or Xenform -related complication.  These 
surgical events typically may occur on an outpatient basis yet can require admission to a 
hospital.  The decision to perform a re -surgery for failed prolapse repair or persistence of 
prolapse symptoms will be per physician and subject discretion and all re -surgery data will 
be captured in the Case Report Forms.  All subjects defined as having a prolapse recurrence 
will be those who have anatomic and symptomatic failure of their prolapse surgery (prolapse 
beyond the hymen and symptoms of vaginal bulge) .

  Subjects undergoing a  re-surgery will be followed to 36 months post their initial study 
procedure as indicated in Table 11.1- 2.  The subject should return to the clinic for the next 
regular study visit as per her original schedule.  If the subject elects to not undergo re -
surgery, then the subject will be followed to the Month 36 visit unless the subject chooses to 
withdraw consent from the study.  No subject will be followed for more  than 36 months 
beyond their initial study procedure .  
11.6. Subject Death  
If any serious adverse event results in death (regardless of relatedness to the study device, 
procedure, or pelvic floor) , the event is to be documented in the source documentation, Case 
Report Form, and reported to the Sponsor within the timeframe noted in Table 21.6- 1 
(Investigator Reporting Requirements ).  If an autopsy is conducted, a copy of the final 
autopsy report should be submitted to the Sponsor or designee.  The primary objective of the 
autopsy is to determine the cause of death, complications and other relevant findings .  
12. Statistical Considerations  
12.1. Endpoints  
12.1.1. Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is an assessment of improvement in pelvic organ prolapse severity at 
36 months as compared to Baseline.  
12.1.1.1. Hypotheses  
Non-inferiority testing for effectiveness will be performed for the primary hypothesis.    
Statistical testing will be  performed to determine if composite endpoint of anatomic and 
symptomatic success rate in transvaginal biologic mesh repair (treatment) group will be non -
inferior to traditional native tissue repair (control) group.  The null hypothesis is that the 
success rate in treatment group is less than or equal to the success rate in control group minus 
margin : 
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 −𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ≤− ∆   
The alternative hypothesis is:  
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 − 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐> − ∆     
where 𝜋𝜋 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡  and 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 are the probability  of success in  the treatment group and 
control group respectively, and ∆ >0 is defined as the non- inferiority margin . 
Statistical testing will be performed to determine if the overall complication rate (i.e., s erious 
device -related or serious procedure -related adverse events) of treatment group is non- inferior 
to the control group.  The null hypothesis is that the complication rate in treatment group is 
greater than or equal to the rate in control group plus mar gin: 
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 −𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ≥∆

  The alternative hypothesis is:  
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 −𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐  <∆   
where 𝜋𝜋 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡   and 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 are the overall complication rate in treatment group and 
control group re spectively, and ∆  >0 is defined as the non- inferiority margin.  
12.1.1.2. Sample Size  
The statistical power calculation is based on a non -inferiority assumption with a binary 
primary outcome. Objective success, based on a composite endpoint of anatomic and 
symptomat ic success at 36 month is assumed to be 70.0%5-8, 16 for the native tissue arm.  
With type I error of 0.05 and type II error of 0.20 (power 80%), 362 subjects (181 subjects 
per arm) are needed to detect non -inferiority of transvaginal biologic to native ti ssue repair, 
using a margin of 12.0%.   
To assess for safety, the overall complication rate (i.e., serious device -related or serious 
procedure -related adverse events) is anticipated to be approximately 14% per arm.9 With 
type I error of 0.05 and type II error of 0.10 (power 90%), 308 subjects (154 subjects per 
arm) are needed to detect non -inferiority with a margin of 11.6%.  
To assess for office- based interventions for complications, the rate is anticipated to be 
approximately 2%.9 With type I error of 0.025 and type II error of 0.10 (power 90%), 330 
subjects (165 subjects per arm) are needed to detect non -inferiority with a margin of 5%.   
To assess for of surgical intervention for complications, the rate is anticip ated to be 
approximately 1%.9 With type I error of 0.025 and type II error of 0.10 (power 90%), 260 
subjects (130 subjects per arm) are needed to detect non -inferiority with a margin of 4%.   
Non-surgical subjects will not be enrolled into this clinical study as all data on this cohort of 
subjects will be obtained from the AUGS Pelvic Floor Disorders Registry under Level 2 and 
analyzed with data from this clinical study.   
Using the above calculations and assuming a 20% loss to follow -up rate, a total of 454 
subjects (227 per study arm) will be enrolled to achieve the primary endpoint of success at 36 
months .   
12.1.1.3. Statistical Methods  
For the primary effectiveness endpoint, non- inferiority will be evaluated using a two -sided 
90% confidence interval for the tre atment difference (Xenform minus native tissue repair).  If 
the entire confidence interval is above the margin (i.e., –12%), non- inferiority will be 
demonstrated.  The confidence interval will be calculated based on the pooling of treatment 
differences acr oss propensity score strata for a binary endpoint, as described in Section 
12.2.3 (Propensity Score Methodology). 
If any data on the primary efficacy endpoint is missing, multiple imputation will be 
performed in which the missing values will be imputed five times under a logistic 
distribution model, using a fully conditional specification that includes the treatment arm and 
the assessments of the treatment success endpoint at each of 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.  As

  a sensitivity analysis, the comparison of  treatments will also be performed using the 
following methods:  
• Tipping point analysis  
• Available cases only (i.e., only the subjects for whom the endpoint was assessed ) 
For the primary safety endpoint, the proportions will be calculated using for the numer ator 
the number of subjects with an endpoint event and for the denominator the number of 
subjects in the analysis population (ITT and Per Protocol group).  Non- inferiority will be 
evaluated using a two- sided 90% confidence interval for the treatment differ ence (Xenform 
minus native tissue repair).  If the entire confidence interval is below the margin (i.e., 
11.6%), non -inferiority will be demonstrated.  The confidence interval will be calculated 
based on the pooling of treatment differences across propensi ty score strata for a binary 
endpoint, as described in Section 12.2.3 (Propensity Score Methodology).  
12.1.2. Secondary  Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will be to evaluate Xenform -related complications and subject reported 
outcomes as safety endpoints between baseli ne and 36 months :  
1. Incidence of Xenform  erosion  
2. Incidence of Xenform  exposure  
3. Incidence of de novo dyspareunia  
4. Improvement in subject specific outcomes at 36 months compared to Baseline (pelvic 
floor symptoms (PFDI -20), QOL (PFIQ -7), sexual functioning (PI SQ-12), TOMUS 
pain scale)  
5. Assessment of subject’s level of improvement, measured by the Patient Global 
Impression of Improvement for Prolapse (PGI -I for Prolapse)  
6. Absence of re- intervention or re -surgery for recurrence or persistence of POP or 
Xenform exposure/erosion 
7. Surgical success based on the following composite outcome:  
a. Subjective success:  patient denies symptoms of vaginal bulging per PFDI -20 
question 3, answering “no” or “yes” but “Not at all” bothersome (<2)  
b. Anatomic success (in the operated compartment): 
• Anterior Segment:  No anterior prolapse at or beyond the hymen or 
POP-Q point Ba<0 
• Apical Segment:  The vaginal apex does not descend more than one -
half into the vaginal canal (i.e. POP -Q point C < 1/2 TVL) for multi-
compartment prolapse or POP -Q point C ˂ 0 for single compartment 
apical prolapse. 
c. No retreatment for POP (treated segment):  No additional surgical treatment 
for POP in the segment(s) of the vagina treated at the index surgery or no

improvements between two groups.  
12.2. General Statistical Methods 
12.2.1. Analysis Sets  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) subject population includes all subjects who provide written 
informed consent to be enrolled into the study and have a surgery initiated (i.e. incision in 
vagina) regardless of their adherence with the entry criteria, regardless of treatment and 
withdrawal/pro tocol deviations.  
The treated population includes all subjects who undergo a study surgical procedure.  The 
subject is defined to have successfully completed the surgical procedure (i.e. prolapse repair 
successful) and discharged.  
The Per Protocol (PP) pop ulation includes all subjects in the ITT Population who received 
the assigned treatment and had no major protocol deviations.  
All primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed on the ITT Population.  The primary 
safety endpoint and non -safety endpoints  will also be analyzed on the per -protocol 
population.  
12.2.2. Control of Systematic Error/Bias  
To reduce selection bias in this non- randomized study, each study center will be permitted to 
enroll subjects in only one of the treatment groups.  Physicians will be s elected based on 
device and clinical research experience and the decision as to which device to implant in 
subjects prior to study initiation at each center.  Some study centers may be permitted per 
Boston Scientific to enroll subjects in both treatment and control groups.  All decisions will 
be documented prior to subject enrollment.  All subjects meeting the eligibility criteria at the 
study center will be screened and enrolled as applicable.  
Propensity score stratification will be utilized to address the potential imbalance in risk 
factors between groups, described in Section 12.2.3 (Propensity Score Methodology) .  This 
analysis will be performed blind to all cli nical outcome data and prior to performing any 
analysis of endpoints.

  12.2.3. Propensity Score Methodology  
Analyses comparing the treatment groups will be adjusted for the propensity score.  The 
propensity score is the probability that the subject enrolled in the mesh arm rather than the 
native tissue (control) arm, given the characteristics of the subject and center. The 
characteristics identified are as follows: age, race, body mass index, smoking, diabetes, post -
menopausal, prior prolapse repair, prior hysterect omy, estrogen use, POP -Q C measurement, 
POP-Q Ba measurement, POP -Q Bp measurement, concomitant repair for stress urinary 
incontinence, and surgeon case volume.  Logistic regression of both treatment arm s (i.e., 
(transvaginal biologic  mesh repair vs. nativ e tissue repair) on these characteristics will be 
used to estimate the propensity score.  The subjects will then be partitioned into five strata 
corresponding to quintiles of the propensity score.  If the balance between treatment arms 
within the strata is  deemed adequate, the treatment difference adjusted for propensity score 
stratum will be estimated as described in the following.  
The propensity adjusted treatment difference will be based on averaging the treatment 
differences of the propensity score stra ta.  For a binary outcome, the within- stratum treatment 
difference is 𝐷𝐷 𝑗𝑗=𝑝𝑝𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗−𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗, where 𝑝𝑝 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗 and 𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗 is the proportion of treatment and control 
subjects, respectively, in stratum j . The variance of 𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗 is approximately  
𝑉𝑉𝑗𝑗=𝑝𝑝𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗(1−𝑝𝑝𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗)
𝑛𝑛𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗+𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗(1−𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗)
𝑛𝑛𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗 
Denoting the number of subjects in stratum j  by 𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗=𝑛𝑛𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗+𝑛𝑛𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗 , the treatment difference 
will be estimated by the (weighted) mean of the within- stratum treatment differences  
𝐷𝐷=�𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗
𝑛𝑛𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗

where 𝑛𝑛 =∑𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is the total sample size across all strata and study arms. D  is approximately 
normally distributed with variance

from which a confidence interval for the true treatment difference will be constructed . For 
each continuous outcome , the conf idence interval will be constructed similarly, with D  and V  
obtained as above with the treatment difference within each stratum replaced by 𝐷𝐷𝑗𝑗=𝑋𝑋�𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗−
𝑋𝑋�𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗 , where 𝑋𝑋�𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗 and 𝑋𝑋�𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗 , respectively, is the mean of the treatment and control subjects, and

  12.3. Data Analyses  
Presentation of summary statistics for continuous variables will include N, mean, median, 
standard deviation, mi nimum, and maximum values for non- missing data.  For categorical 
variables, the number and percentage under each category for non- missing data will be 
presented.  
Additionally, subjects meeting this study’s eligibility criteria under the PFD Registry may be  
included in the analyses plan.  The intention is to utilize a shared control arm from the PFD 
Registry.  
12.3.1. Rate of Office -Based Intervention for Recurrence 
Statistical testing will be performed to determine if the rate of office -based intervention for 
recurr ence in the treatment group will be superior to the control group.  The null hypothesis 
is that the rate of office -based intervention for recurrence in treatment group is greater than 
or equal to the rate in control group:  
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 −𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐  ≥0   
The alternative hypothesis is:  
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 −𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 <0   
where 𝜋𝜋 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡  
 and 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 are the office -based intervention rates for recurrence  in 
treatment group and control group respectively.  The rejection of null hypothesis indicates 
the superiority of the treatment group over the control group.  
12.3.2. Rate of Surgical Intervention for Recurrence  
Statistical testing will be performed to determine if the rate of surgical intervention for 
recurrence in treatment group will be superior to the control group.  The null hypothesis is 
that the rate of surgical intervention for recurrence in treatment group is greater than or equal 
to the rate in control group:   
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 −𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐  ≥0   
The alternative hypothesis is:  
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 −𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 <0    
where 𝜋𝜋 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡  
 and 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 are the surgical intervention rates for recurrence in treatment 
group a nd control group respectively.  The rejection of null hypothesis indicates the 
superiority of the treatment group over the control group. 
The propensity score adjusted analysis described in Section 12.2.3 (Propensity Score 
Methodology) will be used for testing the null hypothesis and computing the confidence 
intervals for rate of office -based intervention for recurrence and surgical intervention for 
recurrence between treatment group and control group.

complications in the mesh (treatment) group is non -inferior to th e native tissue repair 
(control) group.  The null hypothesis is that the rate of office -based intervention for 
complications in treatment group is greater than or equal to the rate in control group plus

margin. 
The rate of office- based intervention for complication is anticipated to be approximately 2%.  
With type I error of 0.025 and type II error of 0.10 (power 90%), 330 subjects (165 subjects 
per arm) are needed to detect non- inferiority with a margin of 5%.   
12.3.4. Rate of Surgical Intervention for Complications  
Statistical testing will be performed to determine if the rate of surgical intervention for 
complications of the mesh (treatment) group is non- inferior to the native tis sue repair 
(control) group.  The null hypothesis is that the rate of surgical intervention for complications 
in treatment group is greater than or equal to the rate in control group plus margin:

where 𝜋𝜋 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡   and 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 are the probabilities of having surgical intervention for 
complication in treatment group and control group respectively, and ∆ >0 is defin ed as the 
non-inferiority margin.  
The rate of surgical intervention complication is anticipated to be approximately 1%.  With 
type I error of 0.025 and type II error of 0.10 (power 90%), 260 subjects (130 subjects per 
arm) are needed to detect non -inferior ity with a margin of 4% .

  For each group, Cox regression will be performed, to include surgical intervention for 
recurrent prolapse as a covariate for analyzing adverse events (pelvic pain, infection, vaginal 
shortening, vaginal scarring, de novo vaginal bleeding, fistula formation and/or de novo 
voiding dysfunction) data. 
Descriptive statistics for the baseline characteristics and QOL outcome for the non -surgery 
(i.e. pessary) group will be summarized from the AUGS PFD  Registry  Level 1/2 data base.  
12.3.5. Sub- Analysis for Sling Repair and Interventions for Recurrence  
12.3.5.1. Subjects with only POP repair and those  with sling and prolapse repair   
A two sample t -test will be performed in pain score change from baseline to each follow -up 
visit within Xenform or native tissue repair group, to compare groups with and without SUI 
surgery. Using this method of analysis will make it less difficult to assess causality for 
adverse events, including pain.  
12.3.5.2. Subjects with office -based intervention for recurrence  
Adverse pro cedural/device event rates and QOL information will be collected for 36 months, 
regardless of whether or not the subject has office- based intervention for recurrence.    
Event rate for each of device -related or procedure -related adverse events of specified  AE 
type ( Xenform erosion, Xenform exposure, dyspareunia ) during the period after the 
intervention will be summarized by treatment group.  Treatment groups will be compared 
using Cox regression for the event -free survival time (starting at the time of firs t office based 
intervention) with treatment arm .   
For each QOL instrument, a comparison using t -test will be performed between native tissue 
repair and Xenform group on the basis of QOL score at the first scheduled follow -up after 
office -based intervention for recurrence.  
A two sample t -test will be used to compare groups with office -based intervention for 
recurrence and without intervention within each treatment group.  QOL score change will be 
reported from the last follow -up visit before office -based i ntervention for recurrence, to the 
next scheduled follow -up visit after office -based intervention for recurrence within each 
treatment group.  For those subjects without recurrence, we will use baseline as the “before” 
time point in analysis, and the QOL data at 6 month follow -up visit as the “after” time point.  
Similarly, event rate for each adverse device and procedure -related event type specified 
(mesh erosion, mesh exposure, dyspareunia), will be compared between subjects with office-
based intervention  for recurrence and those without.  This will be done using a Cox 
regression of time to the first onset of each adverse event after the starting time to compare 
groups with office -based intervention for recurrence and within each treatment group.  The 
starting time will be baseline f or those subjects without intervention, and time of office -based 
intervention for recurrence for those with intervention.

  12.3.8.1. Hypotheses2 
The interim analysis hypothesis is that t ransvaginal biologic  mesh repair (treatm ent) is non-
inferior to traditional native tissue repair  (control)  in both effectiveness and safety  at 12 
months .   
Statistical testing will be performed to evaluate whether transvaginal biologic mesh repair 
(treatment) is non -inferior to native tissue rep air with respect to the  composite  treatment 
success endpoint.  The null hypothesis is that the success rate for Xenform  is inferior to that 
of the control at a non -inferiority margin of 12% : 
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 −𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ≤ −12% 
where 𝜋𝜋 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡   and 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is the success rate in the treatment and control group, 
respectively.  The alternative hypothesis is:  
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 − 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐> −12%      
The rejection of null hypothesis indicates the non -inferiority  of transvaginal biologic mesh 
repair.  
If non- inferiority is demonstrated , then the superiority of transvaginal biologic mesh repair at 
12 months will be evaluated, for which the hypotheses are:  
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 ≤𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 > 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐  
The rejection of null hypothesis indicates the superiority  of transvaginal biologic mesh 
repair.  
Statistical testing will b e performed to determine if the serious complication rate (i.e. serious 
adverse device effects and serio us procedure -related adverse events) of the treatment group is 
non-inferior to the control group  at 12 months . The null hypothesis is that the serious 
complication rate in treatment group is greater than or equal to the rate in control group plus 
margin  of 10%: 
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 −𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ≥10%   
where 𝜋𝜋 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡   and 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is the serious complication rate in the treatment group  and 
control group, respectively. The alternative hypothesis is:  
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 −𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐  <10%    
12.3.8.2. Statistical Methods  
The comparisons of transvaginal biologic mesh repair to native tissue repair will be based on 
a two -sided 90% confidence interval for the treatment difference.   The confidence interval 
will be calculated based on the pooling of treatment differences across propensity score strata 
for a binary endpoint, as described in Section 12.2.3 (Propensity Score Methodology).

  Missing 12 month data for the composite efficacy endpoint will be handled by multiple 
imputation  under a logistic regression model using a fully conditional specification .  The 
imputation model  will include treatm ent group and primary efficacy outcome at 2 and 6 
month.  A total of 5 imputed data sets will be generated.  
The following methods will also be used as sensitivity analyses:  
• Tipping point analysis  
• Observed data only  
 
12.3.9. Justification of Pooling  
The analyses will be presented using pooled data across institutions. For each group, an 
analysis of the poolability will be made using logistic regression for binary outcomes, or 
analysis of variance for continuous outcomes, to assess differences between study institu tions 
and to justify pooling data across institutions .  Centers with less than 5 ITT patients may be 
combined.  
12.3.10. Multivariable Analyses  
For each treatment group, univariate and multivariate analyses will be performed to assess 
possible predictors of the imp rovement in pelvic organ prolapse at 36 month, mesh- related 
complications and subject reported outcomes.  Possible predictors may include, but not 
limited to, demographic/baseline data and risk factors data.  Factors from the univariate 
model with p≤0.20 w ill also be put into multivariate model using a stepwise procedure in a 
logistic regression model.  The significance thresholds for entry and exit into the model will 
be set to p<0.10.  Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) will be performed for subject reported 
outcome with appropriate predictors.  
13. Data Management 
13.1. Data Collection, Processing, and Review  
Good Clinical Practice Guidelines require that investigators maintain information (i.e., 
Source Data) in the subject’s medical records, laboratory reports, clinic charts, etc. (i.e., 
Source Documents) that corresponds to data recorded on the Case Report Forms.  In order to 
comply with these requirements, the following information should be maintained as source 
documentation, including but not limited to:  
• Medical h istory/physical condition of the subject before enrollment  
• Protocol entry criteria  
• Dated and signed notes for specific results of procedures and exams

• Vaginal Shortening or Stenosis  
• Sexual Dysfunction  
19.2.1. Xenform  Exposure and Erosion Event Classification  
Assessment of Xenform  exposure and/or erosion will occur at all follow -up visits with pelvic 
examinations performed at 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 Months post -procedure.  Identification of 
Xenform  exposure and/or erosion will occur by the medical staff  member performing the 
pelvic exam and will be documented as an adverse event on the Case Report Forms.   
19.3. Risks A ssociated with Participation in the Clinical Study  
There are no additional risks  with participation in this clinical study outside of the anticipated 
risks ( see Section 19.2 ) for pelvic organ prolapse as conducted according to standard of care  
procedures.   
19.4. Risk Minimization Actions  
Additional risks may exist.  Risks can be minimized through compliance with this protocol, 
performing procedures in the appropriate hospital environment, adherence to subject 
selection criteria, close monitoring of the subject's physiologic status during research 
procedures and/or follow -ups and by promptly supplying Boston Scientific with all pertinent 
information required by this protocol.  
19.5. Anticipated Benefits  
Theoretical benefits of transvaginally placed Xenform  for the treatment of pelvic organ 
prolapse may include reduction in POP symptoms.  
19.6. Risk to Benefit Rationale  
The use of transvaginally placed mesh has been shown to reduce recurrent prolapse 
following pelvic floor repair. There have been many randomized controlled trials comparing 
outcomes for pelvic floor repair procedures using mesh to non- mesh repair. Of those studies, 
a reduced incidence of recurrent prolapse in the mesh -procedure group has been reported as 
compared to non- mesh groups .   
However, the ris k of mesh- related complications has been reported and can be linked to risk 
factors including body mass index ( BMI ), concomitant hysterectomy, and physician 
experience.   There is no new literature to indicate there would be an unsatisfactory risk 
benefit profile for the use of transvaginally placed mesh for the treatment of POP.

procedures and/or testing, or data collection.  
The obtaining and documentation of Informed Consent must be in accordance with the 
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, ISO 14155:2011 (Clinical investigation of medical 
devices for human subjects -  Good clinical practice) , any applicable national regulations, and 
local Ethics Committee and/or Regulatory authority body, as applicable.   The ICF must be 
accepted by Boston Scientific or its designee  (e.g., CRO), and approved by the center’s 
IRB/EC, or central IRB, if applicable.  
Boston Scientific will provide a study- specific template of the ICF to investigators 
participating in this study.  The ICF tem plate may be modified to meet the requirements of 
the investigative center’s IRB/EC.   Any modification requires approval from Boston 
Scientific or its designee  (e.g., CRO) prior to use of the form.  The ICF must be in a language 
understandable to the subje ct and if needed, BSC will assist the center in obtaining a written 
consent translation.   Translated consent forms must also have IRB/EC approval prior to their 
use.  Privacy language shall be included in the body of the form or as a separate form as 
appli cable.   
The process of obtaining Informed Consent shall:  
• be conducted by the Principal Investigator or designee authorized to conduct the 
process,  
• include a description of all aspects of the clinical study that are relevant to the 
subject’s decision to participate throughout the clinical study,  
• avoid any coercion of or undue influence of subjects to participate,  
• not waive or appear to waive subject’s legal rights,  
• use native language that is non- technical and understandable to the subject or his/her 
legal  representative,  
• provide ample time for the subject to consider participation and ask questions if 
necessary,  
• ensure important new information is provided to new and existing subjects 
throughout the clinical study. 
The ICF shall always be signed and personally dated by the subject or legal representative

  Failure to obtain subject consent will be reported by BSC to the applicable regulatory body 
according to their requirements (e.g., FDA requirement is within 5 working days of learning 
of such an event).  Any violations of the i nformed consent process must be reported as 
deviations to the sponsor and local regulatory authorities (e.g. IRB/EC), as appropriate. 
If new information becomes available that can significantly affect a subject's future health 
and medical care, that inform ation shall be provided to the affected subject(s) in written form 
via a revised ICF or, in some situations, enrolled subjects may be requested to sign and date 
an addendum to the ICF.  In addition to new significant information during the course of a 
study, other situations may necessitate revision of the ICF, such as if there are amendments 
to the protocol, a change in Principal Investigator, administrative changes, or following 
annual review by the IRB/EC.  The new version of the ICF must be approved by the IRB/EC. 
Boston Scientific approval is required if changes to the revised ICF are requested by the 
center’s IRB/EC.  The IRB/EC will determine the subject population to be re -consented. 
A Screening/Enrollment Log will be maintained to document select information about 
candidates who fail to meet the general or “other specific” entry criteria.  
21. Safety Reporting  
21.1. Reportable Events by Investigational Site to Boston Scientific  
Any device -related, procedure -related, or pelvic floor -related adverse event experienced by 
the study subject after informed consent and once considered enrolled in the study, whether 
during or subsequent to the procedure, must be recorded in the CRF.  
Refer to Section 19 (Potential Risks and Benefits) for the known risks associated with the 
study device(s).  
Definitions of the adverse events included in the secondary endpoint will m atch the 
definitions created for the AUGS PFD Registry.  All event definitions will be provided to the 
sites as part of a dictionary in the Manual of Operations.  
When possible, the medical diagnosis should be reported as the Event Term instead of 
individua l symptoms.  
If it is unclear whether or not an event fits one of the above categories, or if the event cannot 
be isolated from the device or procedure, it should be submitted as an adverse event and/or 
device deficiency.  
Underlying diseases are not report ed as AEs unless there is an increase in severity or 
frequency during the course of the investigation.  Death should not be recorded as an AE, but 
should only be reflected as an outcome of a specific SAE (see Section  21.2 for AE 
definitions).  
21.2. Definitions and Classification  
Adverse event definitions are provided in Table 21.2- 1.  Administrative edits were made to

21.7. Boston Scientific Device Deficiencies 
All device deficiencies (including but not limited to complications, malfunctions, use errors, 
product nonconformities, and labeling errors) will be documented and reported to Boston 
Scientific .  If possible, the devic e(s) should be returned to BSC for analysis. Instructions for 
returning the device(s) will be provided.  If it is not possible to return the device, the 
investigator should document why the device was not returned and the final disposition of the 
device.  Device failures and malfunctions should also be documented in the subject’s medical 
record.  
Device deficiencies (including but not limited to failures, malfunctions, and product 
nonconformities) are not to be reported as adverse events.  However, if there is an adverse 
event that results from a device failure or malfunction, that specific event would be recorded 
on the appropriate CRF. 
Any Device Deficiency that might have led to a serious adverse event if a) suitable action 
had not been taken or b) interve ntion had not been made or c) if circumstances had been less 
fortunate is considered a reportable event.  
21.8. Reporting to Regulatory Authorities / IRBs / ECs / Investigators  
Boston Scientific is responsible for reporting adverse event information to all partic ipating 
investigators and regulatory authorities, as applicable.  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB/EC, and regulatory 
authorities of an SAE as required by local/regional regulations. 
22. Committees 
22.1. Safety Monitoring Process  
To pr omote early detection of safety issues, an internal Safety Monitoring Team will provide 
evaluations of safety events.  Success of this program requires dynamic collection of 
unmonitored data as soon as the event is reported.  This is expedited through Bost on 
Scientific’s Safety Office, which is responsible for coordinating the collection of information 
for the subject dossier from the centers.  During regularly scheduled monitoring visits, 
clinical research monitors will support the dynamic reporting proces s through their review of 
source document information.  
23. Suspension or Termination  
23.1. Premature Termination of the Study

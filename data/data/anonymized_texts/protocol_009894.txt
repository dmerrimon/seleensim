1 INTRODUCTION AND  STUDY  DESIGN 
 
1.1 Background  
 
Electronic cigarettes fo r nicotine delivery  
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigar ettes) have proliferated at a rapid rate since their 
introduction into the US market in 2007 and their use as a form of  nicotine delivery 
far outpaced the science base (1, 2). Impor tant questions revolved around their 
abuse liability and safety. Although the design of these devices co ntinues to evolve, 
we have previously described nicotine intake, systemic retention, 
pharmacokinetics, and effects, as well as  vaping behavior and self-administration 
of e-cigarettes (3, 4). We showed that e-cigarettes deliver as much nicotine from 
15 puffs as a typical tobacco cigarette (~1 mg), most of which is systemically retained, and the shape of the plasma nicotine concentration-time curve is also similar to tobacco cigarettes, except  that the maximum plasma nicotine 
concentration is, on average, lower for e-cigarettes. During ad libitum access, e- 
cigarettes were vaped intermittently in groups of 2-5 puffs or single puffs such that 
plasma nicotine levels rose gradually and peaked at the end of the 90-minute 
session. This differs from the rapid incr ease in plasma nicotine observed during 
controlled use of e-cigarettes or during t obacco cigarette smoking. Taken together, 
these results indicate that e-cigarette s have the potential to produce and sustain 
nicotine addiction but their use and abuse liab ility may differ from  tobacco cigarette. 
 
Electronic cigarettes are NO T restricted to nicotine  
Marijuana is the most widely used illicit dr ug (5). While marijuana has traditionally 
been combusted, currently vaping of either loose leaf marijuana or other forms of 
・-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)  oil has been increasing (6). The latest national 
data show that 7.6% of cu rrent marijuana users (past 30 days) and 9.9% of ever 
marijuana users (lifetime) administered THC through a v aporizer or electronic 
device (6) (the study did not differentia te between vaporizers and electronic 
devices like e-cigarettes). The prevalenc e of vaped marijuana or THC is higher 
among younger adults. Prevalence of v aped marijuana/THC among 18-24 and 25- 
34 year-old ever marijuana users was 19.3% and 16.3%, respectively, compared 
to 8.8% for 35-49 year-olds and 5.7% for those 50 years and over (6). A recent 
study also showed high rates of cannabis vaping using e-cigarettes among high 
school students (18.0% among ever e-cigarette users) (7). 
Combined effects of tobacco and marijuana.  
Page 6 of 30  The combined inhalation of tobacco and marijuana is common. Smoking of 
marijuana in a cigar wrapping (a blunt) is very popular among adolescents and 
young adults, particularly in the Afri can American population. Smoking of a 
combination of tobacco and marijuana in  cigarette form is also common, 
particularly in Europe (8) (9). Since bot h marijuana and tobacco are consumed by 
vaping, it is likely that vaping of both products will al so soon become common. Very 
little is known about the pharmacology and safety of simultaneous intake of nicotine 
and THC from vaping. 
1.2 RESEARCH  QUESTIONS  
To understand THC pharmacology and safety of cannabis vaping, including the 
pharmacology and safety of co-administration of nicotine and THC. 
 
1.3 SPECFIC  AIMS/OBJECTIVES  
1. To characterize Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) de livery, systemic exposure, 
and effects from vaping THC-containi ng cannabis leaf alone or cigarette 
tobacco alone, or the combination of cannabis and tobacco. 
 
2. To assess sympathetic nervous system (SNS ) stimulating and subjective SNS- 
related effects of THC alone compared to nicotine (tobacco) alone or combined to THC and nicotine co-administration. 
 
3. To assess emissions of THC, terpenes , and other compounds from electronic 
THC delivery devices. 
 
1.4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
1.4.1 Design Summary  
The study is designed as a within-subj ects single-blinded crossover study. 
Fourteen smokers of tobacco cigarette s and cannabis will switch between three 
conditions, namely: (a) vaping cannabi s leaf, (b) vaping tobacco containing 
nicotine and (c) vaping a combination of  cannabis leaf and tobacco containing 
nicotine. All participants will vape eac h product with t he PAX loose-leaf 
vaporizer. 
PAX vaporizers will be purchased by the st udy team. The cannabis leaf will be 
obtained through the Nationa l Institute on Drug Abus e Drug Supply Program. 
The tobacco containing nicotine, used in conditions (b) and (c) will come from commercially available Marlboro brand cigar ettes. The same amount of cannabis 
or tobacco will be used in all conditions. 
Page 7 of 30  The study will be conducted dur ing three outpatient visits separated by at least 
48 hours. The order of treat ment (cannabis leaf, tobacco  with nicotine, cannabis 
leaf & tobacco with nicotine) will be c ounterbalanced between subjects. Subjects 
will be blinded to the content of the v aporizer on the study day but will be told 
during screening that they will vape cannabis alone, t obacco alone, and cannabis 
plus tobacco with nicotine. 
1.4.2 Number  of Subjects  
A total of 14 subjects will be enrolled in this study over a period of about 6 
months. The anticipated accrual rate is approximately 2-4 subjects per month. 
1.4.3 Study Timeline

• Complete study day 3: $100 
• For complying with all study procedures in cluding attending the orientation visit, 
abstaining from tobacco cigarettes, ni cotine products, and marijuana use 12 
Page 11 of 30  hours prior to Study Days 1, 2 and 3,  subjects will be given an additional $120 
bonus ($40 each day). 
• Total possible compensation is $450. 
 
1.7.2 Lost to Follow Up 
If a participant is unable to be contacted and does  not respond to calls from the Clinical 
Research Coordinator (up to three unsuccessful phone contact attempts), he/she will be 
considered “lost to follow-up” (LTFU). Befo re a participant is considered LTFU, every 
effort will be made to contact him/her. Afte r being considered LTFU no further outreach 
will be conducted. If a formerly LTFU parti cipant re-contacts the CRC outside a given 
study window, participant will be rescheduled for screening.

3 STUDY VISITS AND PROCEDURES 
 
3.1 REDCap  Questionnaire  
Interested participants will fill out a shor t (10-minute) survey on REDCap. The 
CRC will complete an eligibility checklis t, beginning at the time of this online 
survey. This checklist will be labeled first by the REDCap ID and later by the Study 
ID after consent & assignment. The Clinica l Research Coordinator (CRC) will then 
determine if the participant is eligible to attend a Screening Visit based on above inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
3.2 Phone Evaluation  & Confirmation  
3.2.1 Phone Evaluation  Scripts 
Various items related to eligibility must be confirmed by the CRC during a 
phone conversation. 
If preliminarily eligible, the CRC will c ontact the participant by phone and ask 
them the following questions: 
 
Script: “ Okay, I am going to ask you vari ous questions about your medical 
history. This will help us  determine if you are a good match for our study. Do I 
have your consent to ask these questions?” 
 
“1) Have you ever been diagnosed with or told you have any of the following 
disorders? I’ll read a list aloud and you at the end, just let me know yes or no.” 
a) Human immunodeficiency virus infection (or HIV/AIDS) 
b) Congenital immune deficiency syndromes 
c) Chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, cancer, emphysema, or 
heart failure? 
*If yes to a-c, participant is ineligible. End the phone screen. 
2) “Have you ever acquired a disord er from any of the following? ” 
a) Being in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care 
b) Malnutrition 
c) Immunosuppressive therapy (example s of these may be radiation, 
cytotoxic chemotherapy, ant i-graft rejection medica tion, corticosteroids, 
monoclonal antibodies di rected against a specific component of the 
immune system) 
*If yes to a-c, participant is ineligible. End the phone screen. 
3) “Have you ever experienced a traumatic br ain injury, or currently experiencing 
any symptoms resulting from a head injury?” 
*If yes, participant is i neligible. End the phone screen. 
 
4) “Do you have a history of feeli ng paranoid after using marijuana” 
*if yes, participant is i neligible. End the phone screen. 
5) Do you currently take any medications? 
*If a psychiatric medication is a non-SSRI or SNRI, or participant is on 
anticonvulsants, nicotine replacement t herapy, stimulant medication, opioid 
replacement therapy or beta-blockers, participants is ineligible. 
*Review any other questionable medica tions with the PI/Study Doctor. 
 
6) Are you willing to abstain from tobacco  smoking, smoking any other tobacco 
products Page 12 of 30 
Page 13 of 30  (like cigars, cigarillos, blunts, splits & other) from smoking or ingesting and 
cannabis or 
marijuana products, and from using nico tine products of any kind (like e- 
cigarettes, or nicotine gum, patch, loz enge, inhaler) for 12 hours before each of 
your study days? 
*If no, ineligible. 
 
7) If female, for the duration of this study, ar e you willing to use an acceptable 
method of birth control if you have sexual intercourse with a man? Acceptable 
methods are barrier methods, hormonal  methods, or implantation devices. 
Please let me know, yes or no. *If no, ineligible. 
 
8) If participants indicate they are in a drug treatment program & further 
clarification is needed, “I saw you indicated that you are in a drug treatment 
program. Can you let me know what that is for? Did you complete it or are you 
currently in the program” 
*If recently completed a program, they are eligible. If still in the program, 
ineligible. 
 
If still eligible after those questions, a Screening Visit appointment should be 
scheduled immediately. 
   
3.2.2  Scheduling  Script 
 
 V-PAX Phone Screen & Consent Conversation  
   
 If preliminarily eligible based on the REDC ap report, contact the participant by 
 phone and ask them the following questions using the script:  
 
 Study Team: Good afternoon, may I please speak with [name]? 
 
    If the Person is not available: Thank the person who answered and say goodbye. 
               If the Person is available: First confirm t hat you are speaking to the correct person. 
     Study Team: This is [name] calli ng from the UCSF Tobacco Re search Center. I am a  
    coordinator working with Dr. Benowitz’s research group. 
     Is this an Ok time for you to speak?     If the Person says “No” or “I’m not sure” 
 
Study Team: Okay. [Ask if you can schedule another time to talk. If the person is not 
sure or seems hesitant, thank him/her and say goodbye.] 
 
Page 14 of 30   
If the Person says “Yes”  Study Team: Great. I wanted to talk with you about a new study for tobacco cigarette and 
cannabis smokers who are willing to vape c annabis, tobacco and a combination of the 
two using the PAX loose leaf vaporizer . You may remember you filled out a 
questionnaire online to be considered for th is study. You indicated that you were 
interested in learning more.  
 If the Person says “No” or “I’m not sure”  Study Team: No problem. I just w anted to make sure you had the opportunity to learn 
about any study we have at the UCSF Tobacco  Research Center. Thank you for your 
time. 
 If the Person says “Yes”  Study Team: Study Team:  This new study is looking at the safety and addictiveness of 
orally vaping cannabis (THC) and nicotine. This study consists of 5 visits across about 14 
days. First, there is a 45 minute screening visit at our research center, to make sure you are 
a good match for our study. Then you will return for a 30 min orientation visit the day before your first study visit. For each outpatient study  visit, you will be admitted for 8 hours in the 
hospital starting at 7am and will be discharged from our hospital research ward at ZSFG at 
3pm. Each of your 3 outpatient study visits will involve blood draws, urine collections, pulse 
monitoring (heart rate) & questionnaires.  
  That’s the purpose and procedures for our st udy. Can I answer any questions? (if yes,  
answer questions; if no continue…)   Okay, the first step is for me to ask you some  questions to see if you are a good match for  
the study. This can take about 20 minutes. Do you have the time right now to speak with  
me? Do I have your consent to ask these questions?”    Update the Eligibility Checklist as you ask the questions.  Study Team: (if no) “Okay, well it seems like this study may not be the best fit for you,  
which is totally fine. Would you like us to ke ep your name down for other studies as they  
come up?”   (If yes, continue)   Study Team: “Okay, so we reviewed the purpose and procedures of this study. I’d like to let  
you know that research is 100% voluntar y and you can choose at any time not to  
participate.”  
 “I’d like to review some risks with you 
Page 15 of 30   
 We will be collecting blood so there is a risk of pai n, swelling, bruising, or infection at the  
draw site. Some people experience feelings of paranoia after smoking marijuana, so we will  
dismiss you from the study if  you develop feelings of paranoi a. Study procedures may be  
inconvenient and tedious. For example you will bef illing out many forms, spending time in  
the hospital, providing specimens, etc. We will also ask you to abstain from tobacco  
cigarette use, so you may feel uncomfortable , irritable, restless or have difficulty  
concentrating due to possible nicotine withdrawal. Nicotine withdrawal may also result in  
headaches, nausea, fatigue, or changes in mood. We will also  be measuring  
your blood pressure and it may feel uncomfort able depending on the tightness of the cuff.  
And finally, we will be collecting personal informati on from you, so there is a risk of breach  
of confidentiality. However, we will do our best to keep your confidentiality. There may be  
undiscovered drug toxicity associated with the us e of cannabis, that can put you at risk for 
unknown effects. There may be long-term effects associated with the use of cannabis that  
are currently unknown to the scientific community.  Can I answer any questions about risks?   Okay, let’s talk about the benefit s. There are no direct benefi ts to you, but you will be  
helping us learn about how safe and addictive it can it is to vape cannabis and nicotine,  
which has great potent ial benefit to other smokers like you.  
 Here are some important reminders: You will be a sked to abstain from any type of cannabis  
use from 6pm (approximately 12 hours) prior to each hospital admission. This cannabis use  
includes smoking cannabis, vaping cannabis, edi bles, THC concentrates, etc. You will also  
be asked to abstain from recreational drug use from  the time of orientation until the study is  
completed. You will be asked to abstain from the use of other tobacco  products that include  
cannabis for approximately 12 hour s prior to each hospital admission. This includes blunts  
and spliffs. You will be asked to abstain from  using any type of tobacco and nicotine  
products from 6pm (approximately 12 hours) prior to each hospital admission. This nicotine  
use includes cigarettes, e-cigarettes, smok eless tobacco, pipes, cigars and cigarillos.  
 Please note that there are no guest are permitted at the hospita l. This is to protect  
everyone’s confidentiality.   We will also be compensating you for your time and effort – if you comple te all parts of the 
study, you will receive a total of $450 via check.  You will fill out a check request after you  
complete each portion of the st udy and it is estimated to take 4-6 weeks to receive it.  
 
Can I answer any other questions? (if yes, answer) (if no proceed)   Okay, can I ask you a few questions?  
Do you remember – how long does this study  last? (about 14 days) Do you remember – 
how many visits will you have? (5 visits) 
 
Page 16 of 30  What are some risks you may experience? (disco mfort, bruising, mood changes, breach of  
confidentiality, etc)  
 Do you think you are interested in seei ng if you are a match for the study?  
(if yes) “Great! I am going to send you a powerpoi nt presentation via your email. Please look  
it over – it describes in great detail more information about the study. I will also send you the  
consent form – please take time to read it ov er and review carefully. If you agree to  
participate, you will be prom pted to sign the form.  
 I can schedule you for the next phase of screening – this is the 45 minute screening visit I  
mentioned to you. When would be a good ti me for you to come in for that? 
(proceed with scheduling visit)   Okay, very important before you come in…  After you sign the consent form and about 24 hours before your visit, I will send you a  survey link to your email. It’s important that you complete this survey  before you come in,  
otherwise you will need to complete it in per son and the visit will take longer than 45  
minutes.   At the screening visit we will fi rst review a HIPPA form. This is  another important form for  
you to sign related to the study and your health information privacy. We will then have you  fill out a medical history form  and we will conduct a quick interview and collect your basic  
vitals and a saliva sample. At this visit, you will also need to provide a urine sample for a  
drug test and a pregnancy test, if applicable.  The drug test must be positive for THC and  negative for all other drugs. If your positive for any  drugs other than mariju ana it will result in  
an automatic dismissal without payment. Ther e will also be a breath measurement to   
assess your tobacco cigarette smoking status. If this measurement shows you are not a  
smoker, we will dismiss you without payment. If you pass these tests and complete the  screening visit we will compensate you with a $30 check, which will reach  your home within 4-6 weeks.   For this visit, please bring in y our photo ID to verify your name and age. If you are currently  
taking any medications, please bring the bottle or  a copy of your prescription, so we can  
verify any medications you are taking. If you need to reschedule your study visit, we will give  you one option to reschedule, so please make sure you pick a time t hat works with your  
schedule.  Any other questions? (if no) GREAT! I will send you a confirmation em ail which will include the PowerPoint  
summary and consent form. Please do not hesit ate to contact me with any questions.

3.3 SCREENING  VISIT PROCEDURES 
Subjects will undergo a 45 min Screening Visit to obtain and determine their 
enrollment eligibility. During this visi t, participants will complete a basic physical 
assessment (height, weight, heart rate , blood pressure, expired carbon 
monoxide, urine drug test, and pregnancy test  (if applicable), saliva collection, 
and questionnaires: the Severity of D ependence Scale, THC use history and a 
standard screening packet asking demogr aphics, health history and other 
product use. 
 
The CRC will determine initial el igibility via basic physical assessment, toxicology 
screen, and inclusion/exclusion criteria. In the event of a positive toxicology test 
(except marijuana), subject will be dism issed immediately without payment and 
the remainder of the screening visit measur es will not be completed. Participants 
who fail the pregnancy test, blood pressure  test, or BMI assessment will be paid 
and dismissed. Clinical Research Coordinator should follow the Tobacco 
Research Center Pregnancy Test SOP for communicating results with the 
participant. Participants who indicate an exclusionary medication that they 
Page 18 of 30  neglected to report during the initial REDCap survey, will be dismissed without
Page 19 of 30  payment. In all cases of early dismissal, any  collection of biosamples will be      
discarded. 
 
Upon determination of preliminary eligibil ity, the participant’s saliva sample will 
be delivered to the lab for analysis. Partic ipants must have saliva cotinine levels 
≥ 30 ng/mL to be considered eligible for enrollment. NicAlert tests will be used to 
verify cotinine in cases when saliva cotinine samples are not able to be run 
quickly. 
 
3.2.4 Consent  Process 
Upon initiation of the Screening Visit, CRC will initiate the Informed Consent 
process. The participant will be asked to read the first line of the consent form 
aloud to ensure reading ability. The CRC will instruct the participant to read each 
page of the consent document. Participants will be asked to refrain from signing 
the consent form until CRC returns to di scuss consenting document specifics. 
CRC will leave the room for 10 minutes to allow subject to read the consent form. 
After 10 minutes, CRC will return, answer any questions, and present a brief 
PowerPoint presentation highlighting impor tant aspects of the consent document. 
The CRC will ask the partici pant if they have any questions, and will ask them 
questions to verify understanding. Consent will be obtained via participant’s and CRC’s signature at t he conclusion of the PowerPoint  presentation. Two original 
consent documents will be signed by both th e participant and the CRC. One is to 
be filed and stored in the participant’s folder, another is to be given to the 
Hospital research ward for their reco rds. The CRC will make a copy of one of 
those consent documents and give to the participants for his/her records. CRC 
should present participant with a copy of  their Bill of Rights as a research 
participant at UCSF. Participant will also be presented with the HIPAA 
authorization form to sign after an explanat ion of what it entails. The HIPPA form 
must have “entire medical record” c hecked off in Section B, information 
pertaining to drug & alcohol abuse checked off in Section C, and the optional 
activities of banking samples checked off & initialed in Section G. 
3.2.5 Forms for  Data Collection

3.3 ORIENTATION  
Subjects will be asked to come back to the UCSF Tobacco Research Center for 
an Orientation Visit at least 48 hours bef ore Study Day 1. This visit will take 
approximately 30 - 45 minutes. The followi ng will happen during the Orientation 
Visit: 
• A urine sample will be collected and saved. 
• Participants will be asked to not use marijuana or marijuana-containing 
products for 12-hours prior to each study visit. 
• Participants will be asked to not use tobacco cigarettes or nicotine- 
containing products for 12-hours prior to each study visit. 
• Participants will be asked to not use any recreational drugs from that point 
until the study is completed. 
• Study procedures will be reviewed with the participant s, who will do 
practice sessions of outpatient ques tionnaires and gas trap procedure. 
Page 21 of 30  3.4 PHARMACOKINETIC  STUDY:  Outpatient  Visits 
 
3.4.2 Protocol  for Outpatient  Study 
3.4.1(a) Marijuana  preparation  
Cannabis leaf material (11. 7% THC) obtained from NIDA  will be stored frozen in a 
locked room in the Zuckerberg San Francis co General Hospital Pharmacy. When a 
participant is randomized, the pharmacy will dispense of 250 mg of cannabis (this 
includes a back-up supply of 125 mg). All c annabis will then be stored in the freezer 
compartment of the medication  refrigerator in the medica tion room of the Clinical 
Research Services Ward 5B. 
 
Cannabis material to be used by a study participant will be humidified 24-36 hours 
before use. Using a petri dish placed at the bottom of the des iccator, 2 centrifuge tubes, 
each filled with sodium chloride solution, will be emptied into the dish. Cannabis 
cigarettes will be placed on the desiccator pla tform and maintained at room temperature 
overnight, which is expected to raise the mois ture of the cannabis cigarettes by 3 to 5%. 
Cannabis material will be used within one h our after removal from the humidifier. 
 
3.4.1(b) Hospital  Admission Protocol  
 
Before arrival to the hospital, the study co-I or CRC will meet  the participant to 
collect a urine sample for drug testing.  Only when it is confirmed that the 
participant is negative for all drugs other than cannabis, will we admit him/her on 
the research ward. 
 
Upon arrival at the research ward, the following proce dures will occur: 
1. Nurses will ask the participant when t hey last smoked, vaped, or used 
THC. 
 If the participant smoked cigarettes or vaped e-cigarettes after 10pm 
the night before either admission, they will be dismissed from the 
study. 
2. An expired CO test will be administer ed. If their CO reading is greater 
than or equal to 5 ppm, they will eit her be dismissed fr om the study or 
procedures will be delayed depending on PI discretion. 
3. A pregnancy test will be administered to female parti cipants. If the 
pregnancy test is positive, they will be dismissed from the study. 
4. If the participant is female, the pregnan cy test will also serve as the voided 
urine. If the participant is  male, they will provide urine sample for discard.

5 ADVERSE  EVENTS  & PROTOCOL  DEVIATIONS  
 
5.1 SAFETY  MONITORING  
During the outpatient stay, subjects will be monitored by the Clinical Research 
Coordinator and 5B staff who will directly contact the study physician in case of 
any subsequent adverse events. If the subjects experience serious adverse 
effects, the research staff will evaluate this  with them and decide if they should be 
withdrawn from this study. 
 
5.2 DEFINITION  OF ADVERSE  EVENTS  
 
5.2.1 Adverse  Event 
An adverse event (also known as an adverse experience) is defined as any 
untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered dr ug related. More specific ally, an adverse event can 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), 
Page 29 of 30  symptom, or disease temporally associ ated with the use of a drug, without any 
judgment about causality. An adverse event  can arise from any  use of the drug 
(e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
5.2.2 Adverse  Reaction  
An adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event caused by the use of a 
drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of  all suspected adverse reactions for 
which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event. 
5.2.3 Suspected  Adverse  Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is defined as  any adverse event for which there is 
a reasonable possibility that the dr ug caused the adverse event. For the 
purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonabl e possibility” indicates that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relati onship between the drug and the adverse 
event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than an adverse reaction. 
 
5.2.4 Unexpected  Adverse  Reaction  
An adverse event or suspected adverse r eaction is considered unexpected if it is 
not listed in the investigator brochure or package insert(s), or listed in the consent form, or is not listed at the specificity or severity that  has been observed, or, if an 
investigator brochure is not required or av ailable, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general invest igational plan or elsewhere in the 
current application. 
“Unexpected,” as used in this definiti on, also refers to adverse events or 
suspected adverse reactions that are m entioned in the investigator brochure as 
occurring with a class of drugs or as  anticipated from the pharmacological 
properties of the drug, but are not spec ifically mentioned as occurring with the 
particular drug under investigation. 
Adverse events that would be anticipated to occur as part of the disease process 
are considered unexpected fo r the purposes of reporting because they would not 
be listed in the investigator  brochure. For example, a certain number of non-acute 
deaths in a cancer trial would be antic ipated as an outcome of the underlying 
disease, but such deaths would generally  not be listed as a suspected adverse 
reaction in the inve stigator brochure. 
Page 30 of 30  5.2.5 Serious Adverse  Reaction  
An adverse event or suspected adverse r eaction is considered serious if, in the 
view of either the invest igator or sponsor, it resu lts in any of the following 
outcomes: 
• Death 
• Life-threatening adverse event 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongat ion of existing hospitalization 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life function 
• Congenital anomal y/birth defect 
Important medical events that  may not result in death, are life-threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prev ent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emer gency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpati ent hospitalization, or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse. 
5.2.6 Life‐threatening  Adverse  Events 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered life-threatening if, 
in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction that, had it o ccurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death. 
 
5.3 REPORTING  ADVERSE  EVENTS  
Reporting of serious adverse events will fo llow the current requirements of the 
Committee on Human Research (CHR). Specif ically, the following will be reported 
within five (5) working days of th e PI’s awareness, in writing: 
 All serious adverse events associated with the study procedures and/or 
 Any incidents or problems involving the conduct of the study or patient 
participation, including problems with the recrui tment and/or consent 
process. The Principal Investigator will provide a discussion of such 
events to the CHR on an annual basis during study renewal. 
 Any incidents or questionable adverse events are discussed at the weekly 
staff meetings with the PI. 
Page 31 of 30  The standard adverse event  grading scale will be used to report any potential

5.4 PROTOCOL  DEVIATIONS  AND VIOLATIONS  
Protocol deviations are defined as an ev ent that deviates from the defined study 
protocol, but does not pose any risk to the pa rticipant or harm to the quality of the 
study data. For example, a follow-up call may be conducted outside of the 
stipulated window, or a section of questions on a questionnaire may be missed 
due to a mistake in branching. Deviations will be recorded on a protocol deviation 
sheet and reviewed and signed by the PI. 
 
Protocol violations are events that devia te from the defined study protocol, but 
put the participant at risk and/or cause ha rm to the study data. For example, if a 
participant was enrolled in the study but they were under the age of 12 or they 
were enrolled without consent of a parent. Protocol viol ations will be recorded on 
a protocol violation sheet, reviewed and signed by the PI and reported to the 
CHR.

6.3 DATA ANALYSIS  
The study is not hypothesis-driven but will provide valuable data to guide future 
research as well as provide needed data on THC delivery and effects from vaping. 
Variables of interest include amount of THC inhaled, amount exhaled, and amount retained; pharmacokinetic parameters fo r THC, 11-OH-THC, and nicotine, the 
psychoactive compounds; heart rate and blood pressure change; and subjective 
effects. 
Delivered and Retained Doses: Delivered THC and nicotine doses are estimated 
as the change in e-cigarette weight × conc entration of THC or nicotine in e-liquid. 
The amount of THC or nicotine systemically retained is estimated as delivered dose minus amount in gas traps. 
THC, 11-OH-THC, and Nico tine Pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetic parameters 
will be estimated from blood THC and 11-OH-THC and plasma nicotine 
concentrations using Phoenix WinNonlin 6.3 (Pharsight Cor poration, Mountain 
View, CA). Time to max concentration (T
max), max concentration (C max), and area 
under the blood/plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) will be estimated using a 
non-compartmental model and trapezoidal rule. C max, and AUC 0∞ will be adjusted 
for baseline nicotine levels. 
Averages and 95% confidence intervals will be computed by e-liquid type (THC 
only or 
Page 33 of 30  THC+nicotine). Although this study is not  hypothesis-driven, we will use mixed 
model analysis of variance (ANOVA) to a ssess differences in these variables 
between e-liquids type. Models will include sex as a covariate.

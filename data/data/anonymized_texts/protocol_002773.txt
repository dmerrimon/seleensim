   PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Title: A PHASE II, OPEN -LABEL SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY STUDY OF A 
RENAL AUTOLOGOUS CELL THERAPY  (REACT)  IN PATIENTS WITH  
TYPE 2 DIABETES AND CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (REGEN -003) 
Therapeutic Product:   REACT  is made from expanded autologous selected renal cells 
(SRC) obtained from each individual subject’s kidney biopsy. To manufacture REACT , 
kidney biopsy tissue from each enrolled subject will be sent to ProKidney , where renal cells 
will be expanded and SRC selected. SRC will be formulated in a gelatin -based  hydrogel at a 
concentration of 100 x 106 cells/mL, packaged in a 10 mL syringe, and shipped to the 
clinical site for use.  
Study Objectives:  
Primary Objective: The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety of 
REACT  injected in one recipient kidney. 
• Primary Outcome Measures:  procedure and/or product related ad verse events 
(AEs) through 24 months post- injection.  
Secondary Objective: The secondary objective of the study is to assess the safety and 
tolerability of REACT  administration by assessing renal- specific AEs over a 24-month 
period following injection. 
• Secondary Outcome Measures:  renal -specific laboratory assessments through 24 
months post- injection.  
Exploratory Objective: Exploratory objectives of the study are designed to assess the 
impact of REACT  on renal function over a 24- month  period following injection and on the 
Quality of Life.  
• Exploratory Outcome Measures: 1) clinical diagnos tic and laboratory 
assessments  of renal structure and function (including eGFR, serum creatinine, 
and proteinuria) to assess changes in the rate of progression of renal disease, 2)  
patient -reported outcomes from the Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL) 
and EQ-5D-5L surveys obtained at baseline (i.e., after randomization, but bef ore 
REACT  injection) through 24 months after the last REACT  injection.  
Study Design: Multi -center, prospective, open- label, single -group study. All subjects will 
be treated with two REACT  injections 6 months (+4 weeks) apart after biopsy. 
Randomization: Open -label, non-randomized. 
Control Group: Each subject will serve as his or her own control; the patient’s previous 
medical history, which must include a minimum 6-month period of observation of renal 
function, will serve as the control for rate of progression of renal insufficienc y. 
Sample Size:  Up to 10 patients will be treated with REACT . As this is a Phase II safety study, 
robust statistical analysis will not be performed. Therefore, the sa mple size proposed for this 
study is a size typical for in Phase 1 studies, allowing for identification of saf ety outcomes in 
a limited population.  
Study Population:  Male or female patients 30 to 65 years of age with CKD and eGFR  
between 14 and 20 mL/min/1.73m2. Patients should have sufficient historical clinical data to 
determine their individual rate of CKD disease progression.

 Inclusion Criteria: Unless otherwise noted, subjects must satisfy each inclusion criterion to 
participate in the study. Inclusion criteria will be assessed  at the Screening Visit, prior to 
renal biopsy, and before each REACT  injection unless otherwise specified.  
1. The subject i s male or female, 30 to 65 years of age on the date of informed 
consent. 
2. The subject has an established diagnosis of T2DM. 
3. The subject has an established diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy as the underlyi ng 
cause of renal disease.  
4. The subject has an establi shed diagnosis of CKD not requiring renal dialysis, 
defined as having an eGFR between 14 and 20 mL/min/1.73m2 inclusive at the 
Screening Visit and prior to REACT  injection.  
5. The subject has blood pressure less than 150/90 at the Screening Visit, prior to 
renal biopsy, and prior to REACT  injection(s). At the time of the biopsy and 
injections, the subject’s BP should not be significantly below the previously 
recorded stable pressure . 
6. The subject has stable blood pressure and is maintained on a stable anti-
hypertensive medication regimen, if treatment for hypertension is necessar y. If

least 8 weeks prior to ren al biopsy. Treatment must be stable during the 6- week  
period immediately prior to REACT  injection. Stable treatment is defined as dose 
adjustment to no less than one half of the current dosage or to no more than 2 times 
the current dosage. Dose interruptions up to 7 days due to medical necessity are 
allowed.  
7. A minimum of 3 measurements of eGFR or sCr should be obtained at least 3 
months apart prior to the Screening Visit or within the previous 24 months to

method of birth control throughout the duration of the study. 
Note : A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one that results in a 
low failure rate (i.e. , less than one percent per year) when used consistently and 
correctly, such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, s ome 
intraute rine devices (IUDs ), sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized partner. 
24. The subject has a history of active alcohol and/or drug abuse that, in the judgment 
of the Investigator, would impair the subject’s ability to comply with the protoc ol.

jeopardized by participating in the study. 
26. The subject has used an investigational product within 3 months prior to REACT  
injection without receiving written consent from the Medical Monitor. 
Number of Sites :  Up to 10 clinical centers will be included in the study.  
Study Duration : treatment to begin as soon as the REACT  product is made available and 
assuming a one-month interval prior to receiving the first REACT  injection, and assuming a 
6-month interval before receiving the second injection, plus a 24 month follow up peri od 
after the final injection, the duration of treatment would be: 
- 31 months for a series of 2 REACT  injections  
Study Enrollment : up to 10 subjects will be enrolled into the study. Patients who complete 
screening procedures satisfying all I/E criteria will be e nrolled into the study immediately 
prior to the biopsy.  Patients who do not meet all criteria before the biop sy is taken will be 
considered screen failures.  Patients who have a biopsy but are not injected f or whatever 
reason will be discontinued from the study and may be replaced. Once a patient ha s been 
injected, the patient will have completed treatment and every  effort should be made to 
ensure the patient completes all follow -up visits. 
Investigational Plan : 
Screening : Subjects who satisfy eligibility criteria and provide writte n informed consent 
may be entered into the study. The subject should have adequate, historical clinical data to 
provide a reasonable estimate of the rate of progression of CKD (re: Inc lusion 7). Screening 
procedures include a full physical exam, ECG, and laboratory assessments (hem atology, 
clinical chemistry, and urinalysis). An ultrasound will be performed to confirm  the presence 
of two kidneys with normal anatomic features. A MRI study will determine kidney size a nd 
volume. 
Renal Biopsy :  Three days or less before undergoing renal biopsy, enrolled subjects will 
report to the clinic and undergo an interim physical exam along with an ECG and renal MRI  
(if not completed during or after the Screening Visit). Laboratory tests, includi ng renal 
ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT)  REGEN -003 v1.7 
Confidential  Page 7 12 January  2021  
 function, hemoglobin, and a pregnancy test for females will also be perform ed. Eligible 
subjects satisfying all inclusions and exclusion criteria will be  admitted to the hospital  / 
clinical research center to undergo a kidney biopsy. A minimum of 2 tissue cores mea suring 
at 1.5cm a piece must be collected using a 16-gauge  biopsy needle to provide sufficient 
material  for the manufacture of REACT . Subjects who do not experience complications 
from the biopsy may be discharged the same day consistent with site standard practice. Each 
individual subject’s kidney biopsy tissue will be sent to ProKidney. 
REACT  Injection :  Ten to 14 days before the scheduled injection date, subjects will 
undergo an interim physical exam for ongoing verification of inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. Subjects also will undergo renal scintigraphy ( i.e., split kidney function scan) to 
find out what percentage each kidney contributes to total baseline kidney function. O n the 
day of the scheduled REACT  injection, eligible subjects will be admitted into the hospit al / 
clinical research unit. After warming to liquefy the hydrogel, REACT  will be injecte d into 
the same kidney that was previously biopsied using a percutaneous approach. This 
procedure will follow a standardized technique, such as that used in the ablation of rena l 
masses by radiofrequency or cryogenic methods. Subjects without complications may be 
discharged the same day consistent with site standard practice. An ultrasound wi ll be 
performed the day after injection to detect possible, subclin ical AEs. It is anticipated that all 
subjects will receive 2 REACT  injections given 6 months (+4 week s) apart. The first and 
second injections will occur in the same kidney in which the biopsy was taken. Therefore,  
only one kidney will be used for the duration of this study. 
Follow- up: Subjects will complete follow -up evaluations on Days 1, 7, 14, 28 (± 3 days) 
and Months 2, 3, 4 and 5 (± 7 days) after the first REACT  injection , and on Days 1, 7, 14, 
28 (± 3 days) and Months 2 and 3 (± 7 days) after the second  REACT  injection . Depending 
on when the second injection is administered ( i.e., at 6 months [+4 w eeks]), subjects may 
undergo evaluations at 6 months after the first REACT  injection. Following the final 
REACT  injection, subjects will complete long -term, follow -up assessments of safety and 
efficacy through 6, 9, 12, 15-, 18-, 21-, and 24-months post- treatment.  
Safety Monitoring :  Hemorrhage following REACT  injection is a known and foreseeable 
risk to subjects participating in this study. Therefore, hemoglobin will be me asured by the 
site’s local laboratory at the following times: a) before, b) after procedure per site standard 
practice . 
  Investigational Product, Dosage and Mode of Administration: 
Investigational Product:  REACT  is made from expanded autologous selected renal cells 
obtained from each individual subject’s kidney biopsy. To manufacture REACT , biopsy 
tissue from each enrolled subject will be sent to ProKidney , in whose facilities renal cells 
will be expanded and SRC selected. SRC will be formulated in a gelatin -based hydrogel at 
a concentration of 100 x 106 cells/mL, packaged in a 10 mL syringe, and shipped to the 
clinical site.  
Dosage: The volume of REACT  to be administered will be determined by pre- procedure 
MRI vo lumetric 3D evaluation or ellipsoid formula (Length x width AP plane x width 
Transverse plan x .62). Based on pre- clinical data, the dose of REACT  will be 3  x 106 
cells/g estimated kidney weight (g KWest). Since the concentration of SRC per mL of 
REACT  is 100 x 106 cells/mL, the dosing volume will be 3.0 mL for each 100 g of kidney 
weight. Using this dosing paradigm, the following table shows the dosing volume and 
number of SRC to be delivered relative to estimated kidney weight. The maximum volume 
of REACT  injected into the biopsied kidney will be 8.0 mL.

*Kidney weight will be estimated from the results of  an MRI study performed on or after the  Screening Visit  until Day

Investigational Product, Dosage and Mode of Administration:  Dosage (continued)  
It is anticipated that all subjects will receive two p lanned REACT  injections to allow dose- 
finding and evaluate the duration of effects. The first and second injections will oc cur in the 
same kidney in which the biopsy was taken. In some cases, a subject or the Investiga tor may 
decide to postpone or withhold the second REACT  injection. For example, if there appears 
to be any untoward safety risk, or rapid deterioration of renal function, or the development 
of uncontrolled diabetes or uncontrolled hypertension, or the development of a malignancy 
or an  intercurrent infection, then the second REACT  injection should not be administered. 
Mode of Administration:  REACT  will be inject ed into the biopsied kidney using a 
percutaneous approach. The percutaneous method will employ a standardized technique 
(such as that utilized in the ablation of renal masses by radiofrequency or cryogenic 
methods).  
Data Safety Monitoring Board:  A Data S afety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be 
chartered to oversee subject safety, especially as it rel ates to unexpected investigational  
product- related events. The DSMB will minimally consist of 3 members who have expertise  
directly related to protocol- specified activities. It will function independently, and its  
members will have no other engagement with ProKidney . The DSMB will meet  by 
teleconference at regular intervals, depending on the speed of subject enrollment and t he 
amount of new data generated. The DSMB will advise ProKidney on aspects concerning the 
safety of subjects participating in the clinical trial. Apart from reviewi ng study data, the 
DSMB will consider feedback from the Sponsor and Investigators. The DSMB will s hare its 
recomme ndations with the study centers, Institutional Review Boards/Et hics Committees,  
and regulatory authorities, as appropriate. Other specific activities and resp onsibilities of the 
DSMB will be detailed in the DSMB charter.

 Statistical Analysis Methods:   Statistical analyses will be primarily descriptive in nat ure 
and no statistical hypothesis testing is planned for the study. Unless otherwise sp ecified, 
continuous variables will be summarized by presenting the number of non- missing 
observations (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical 
variables will be summarized by presenting frequency count and percentage  for each

Notes:  
* Day 1 follow -up visit should only be conducted if there is a saf ety event identified during or after the kidney bio psy. 
**Every attempt should be made to ensure the second REACT  injection is administered 6 months (+4 weeks) after  the first injection . In the event that the subject  cannot schedule  
his/her second REACT  injection 6 months after receiving the first injection or  cannot keep his/her scheduled  6-month visit, ProKidney  and the Medical Monitor must be 
notified  immediately. The expectation is that the subject an d the clinical center will accommodate the Sponsor’ s preference that the series of 2  REACT  injections should be 
administered no  more than 6 months apart.  
a. If the screening assessment falls outside of the 60 -day window before renal biopsy, re -screening will be performed as described in Screeni ng (Section  6.1). 
b. Because the second REACT  injection will occur 6 months (+ 4 weeks) after the first injection, the 6 -month visit may not be scheduled.  
c. In the eve nt that a second REACT  injection will not be administered, the subject wil l undergo all follow -up assessments after the last REACT  injection at the 24 -month EOS 
Visit.  
d. The EOS Visit will take place 24 months after the l ast REACT  injection, or when the subject is terminated from t he study by the Investigator ( Section  8.6) or when the 
subject  voluntarily discontinues from the study ( Section  5.4). 
e. The Informed Consent Form must be signed and dated prior to conducting any study -specific procedures, including those at the Sc reening Visit.  Signing the Informed Consent 
Form starts the 60-day timeline for screening.  
f. The PE and interim PE are described in Section  7.2.2 . 
g. Vital signs include heart rate, resting blood press ure, respiration rate, and body temperature. ( Section  7.2.1 ). At the Pre -Biopsy Visit (Day -3 to Day -1) and the Pre -Injection Visit 
(Day -14 to Day -10) three BP measurements will be taken and the ave rage will be used to satisfy entry criteria.  
h. Vital signs (included are heart rate, blood pressur e, and respiration rate) will be measured throughou t the procedure. Temperature is not required to be recorded throughout the 
procedure.  
i. Refer to  Table  2 for a schedule of  laboratory assessments . 
j. Ultrasound will be performed at the Screening Visit  to verify subject eligibility and to obtain baseli ne echogenicity reading. Subsequent Ultrasounds wil l monitor echogenicity.  
k. Ultrasound will be performed following the in -patient renal biopsy on Day 0 and Day 1, and following the in-patient REACT  injection(s) on Day 0 and Day 1 with the 
aim of  monitoring possible, subclinical AEs.  
l. A MRI study without contrast will be performed at t he Screening Visit through Day -1 before renal biopsy to determine kidney size and volume.  
m. Renal scintigraphy will be performed before the fir st REACT  injection, before the last REACT  injection, at the 6 -Month Visit after the last REACT  injection, at the 12 -Month 
Visit after the last REACT  injection, and at the month 24/EOS Visit.  
n. The REACT  preparation will be handled and injected according to procedures described in the Study Reference Manu al. 
o. CT Scan must be used in conjunction with ultrasound for the REACT  injection procedure.  
p. Subjects may be admitted to hospital per site stand ard practice. Subjects who do not experience compli cations may be discharg ed the same day consistent with site standar d 
practice.  
q. Subjects will undergo a funduscopic exam with retin al photography of both retinae to monitor diabetic retinopathy at screening, month 12, and month 24/EO S visit.

Notes:  
*Day 1  follow -up visit should only be conducted if there is a saf ety event identified during or after the kidney bio psy.
**Every attempt should be made to ensure the second REACT  injection is administered 6 months (+ 4 weeks) afte r the first injection . In the event that the subject cannot schedule
his/her second REACT  injectio n 6 months after receiving the first injection, or cann ot keep his/her scheduled 6-month visit, ProKidney  and the Medical Monitor must be 
notified  immediately. The expectation is that the subject an d the clinical center will accommodate the Sponsor’ s preference that the series of 2 REACT  injections should be 
administered no  more than 6 months apart.  
a.If the screening  assessment  falls outside of  the 60 -day window  before renal  biopsy,  re-screening will  be performed as  described in Screening  (Section  6.1).
b.Because the second  REACT  injection  will occur  6 months  (+4 weeks)  after the first injection,  the 6-month visit  may not be scheduled.
c.In the  event that a second REACT  injection  will not be  administered,  the subject will undergo  all follow -up assessments  after the last  REACT  inject ion at  the 24-month EOS 
Visit.
d.The EOS Visit will take  place 24 months  after the last REACT  injection,  or when the  subject  is terminated from  the study by the  Investigator  (Section  8.6), or when the  
subject  voluntarily discontinues  from the study ( Section  5.4).
e.The clinic will perform  a urine dip-strip pregnancy test.  If positive,  then a  confirmatory test  will be performed by  the central  laboratory.
f.Post-menopausal  women  with a confirmatory FSH  test do not  have to undergo  pregnanc y testing throughout  the study.
g.Within 48 hours  before Days 0 for  renal  biopsy and REACT  injection(s),  hemoglobin levels  will be verified as  > 9 g/dL  per site standar d practices.
h.On Days  0 for  renal biopsy and REACT  treatment  (s), hemoglobin  and hematocrit  will be measured  before and  after procedure per  site standard  practice at  the local  lab. These 
samples  will be processed  by the site’s  local laboratory  to accelerate notification  of results  and subsequent  decisions  affecting clinical  care. Additionally,  blood samples  for 
hemoglobin  and hematocrit  after procedure  will be sent to the central  laboratory where  results  can be  entered into the  study database.
i.Prior  to, day of, and day after  biopsy and REACT  injection(s),  microscopic  urinalysis  will be performed using a  dip (test)  stick
j.β2-microglobulin will  be assessed in both serum  and urine  samples .
k.Research samples  (serum/plasma  and urine)  will be collected,  frozen,  and store d for the evaluation of  novel biomarkers.

1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.1. Chronic Kidney Disease  
1.1.1.  Background 
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is characterized by progressive nephropathy t hat without 
therapeutic intervention will worsen until the patient reac hes end stage renal disease (ESRD). It  is 
defined as reduced kidney function, demonstrated by decreased estimated glomerular fil tration 
(eGFR) or evidence of kidney damage, such as increased exc retion of urinary albumin. Global 
prevalence of CKD is estimated at 8 -16% .1  CKD is associated with considerable morbidity, such as 
diabetes mellitus ,2 and is often accompanied by adverse outcomes owing to underlying disease 
states or and/or risk factors such as hypertension and renovascular disease .3   Ninety -seven  percent 
of patients with moderate to severe CKD have most ly asymptomatic Stage 3 disease, but even this 
stage of CKD bears a two - to four-fold rise in cardiovascular disease risk along with a significant 
increase in all -cause mortality .4, 5   Only a small proportion of patients progress to ESRD ( i.e., Stage 
5 disease); even with costly treatments, however, patients with ESRD experience substantial 
morbidity and mortality .4   To survive, ESRD patients require renal replacement therapy (dialysis or 
kidney transplantation). Preventing or delaying adverse outcomes of CKD via early interv ention is 
the primary strategy in CKD management .6 Nevertheless, early treatments have been less than 
optim al, resulting in a significant unmet  medical need for improved interventional strategies to 
manage CKD and delay progression to ESRD.  
1.1.2.  Progressive Staging of CKD 
The major  causes  of CKD  are diabetes  and hypertension.  Nearly  half of all CKD  cases  arise f rom 
diabetes with or without hypertension .2,5   The incidence of CKD continues to increase, primarily 
due to  the increased  incidence of  Type 2  Diabetes  Mellitus  (T2DM ).2
Staging and grading of kidney function is most often quantified by the estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (GFR), which is defined as “the volume of plasma from which a given s ubstance is 
completely  cleared  by glomerular  filtration  per unit time” .7  Creatinine clearance is  the principal  
endogenous marker that is used to measure GFR. In February 2002, with the aim of providing a 
uniform definition of CKD, the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative of the US Kidney 
Foundation defined CKD and the various stages of CK D8 (Table  4). For example, the threshold for 
CKD is 60 mL/min/1.73m2, which is less than one-half of the GFR for a normal, young adult male 
(120-130 mL/min/1.73m2).9   Additionally, there is a heightened risk for CKD complications when 
the GFR  is 60 mL/m in/1.73m2 and lower. 
Table  4 defines  CKD  stages  according  to GFR  measurements,  and the relative prevalence  and 
clinical  action  taken  at each stage .13   The initial stage of diabetic nephropathy (Stage 1) occurs over 
a period of several years and is characterized by microalbuminuria (30- 300 mg/24 hr .) followed by 
macroalbuminuria (> 300 mg/24 hr .). As the ability of the kidney to filter blood waste products 
declines,  serum  creatinine rises.  With  increasing  kidney  damage (Stages  2-4), rising blood pressure 
further  exacerbates  kidney  disease.  When  the kidneys  cease to  function entirely (Stage 5 [ESRD]), 
renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation) is required.

All-cause mortality rates were shown to increase as GFR declined ; mortality rates were highest at 
Stages 4 -5 of CKD .10,11,12  Populations defined as having an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 consistently 
exhibited a higher mortality rate than comparator groups where there was no evidence  of CKD. 
1.1.3.  Standard -of-Care in CKD  
Treatment of patients with CKD is focused on slowing progression and preparing for ki dney failure 
/replacement. For many pati ents, CKD occurs as part of a complex comorbidity cluster, especially 
with cardiovascular disease and T2DM. 
Increased risk of cardiovascular disease can be a complication of CKD or an i ndependent 
comorbidity associated with T2DM .14 Collectively, the aim is to lower cardiovascular risk and 
prevent or slow the progression of kidney failure via administration of: 1) angiotensin conve rting 
enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) to decrease  proteinuria and 
control hypertension; 2) insulin and anti-diabetic agents for glycemic control (e.g., reduced serum 
hemoglobin A1c); and, 3) statin therapy to counter dyslipidemia. 
When a patient reaches ESRD, renal replacement therap y (i.e. , dialysis or transplantation) is 
indicated. The vast majority of Stage 5 patients receive hemodialysis .15   Dialysis replaces about 5 -
15% of kidney function, depending on the intensity and frequency of use; dialysis also helps to 
restore fluid and electrolyte balance when kidneys fail. However, the life- expectancy of an ESRD 
patient initiating hemodialysis is only 4 -5 years .16   Additionally, hemodialysis has been associated 
with multiple, serious complications as well  as interference with quality of life, such as the need to 
undergo dialysis up to three times per week. Although kidney transplantation remains the m ost 
effective form of therapy at this time; there is a c hronic shortage of organs. If a patient is able to 
secure a kidney for transplantation, long-term immunosuppressive therapy is require d to prevent 
rejection. Use of these regimens results in a higher incidence of infection and, over t he long term, 
some types of cancer .17 Taken together, there is a critical medical need for impro ved therapies for 
CKD which could dramatically slow the progression of disease and significantly dela y the need for 
renal transplantation. 
1.2. Scientific Rationale  
ProKidney is developing Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT ) based on extensive scientific 
evaluation of its biologically active component known as SRC ( i.e., homologous, autologous 
selected renal cells). This cell population is naturally involved in renal repair  and 
regeneration .18,19,20,21,22 ,23,24 ,25,26,27,28 ,29,30,31 ,32   Therapeutic intervention with REACT  is intended to 
Confidential  Page 24 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
improve renal function in subjects with CKD and T2DM and delay the need for renal dial ysis or 
transplantation which, based on the current standard-of- care, is inevitable for ESRD.  
1.3. Non-clinical Pharmacology Studies  
In a series of pre-clinica l studies, Tengion ( a forme r regenerati ve medici ne compa ny) defined the 
pharmacologica l characteristic s of SRC and delayed t he progression of experimenta l model s of 
CKD by augmenting rena l structur e and function .18,19,33,34 ,35,36   Tengion subsequently conduct ed 
safety pharmacology and GLP toxicology studies. An overview of these non-cli nical  studies  is 
presented in  Table 5 (Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure  for more detailed information).

1.3.1.  Pharmacodynamics 
Proof of principle for SRC as the biologically active component of REACT  was established in 
multiple animal models of CKD. For example, the 5/6th nephrectomy (Nx) rodent mass r eduction 
model of CKD allowed for an optimized selection of a therapeutically relevant SR C cell population. 
A 70% Nx canine model of CKD confirmed SRC activity in a large mammal, while the ZS F-1 rat 
Confidential  Page 25 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   served as proof- of-principle for demonstrating the effects of SRC in a model relevant to T2DM .37 
SRC delivered directly into the kidney cortex in multiple experimental models of CKD induc ed a 
regenerative response through direct engraftment or tissue replacement, and also i nduced secretory 
factors via a putative paracrine mechanism .18,21,22,24, 26 
This intervention strategy significantly improved survival, stabilized disease pr ogression, and 
extended the longevity in both the 5/6th Nx model and the ZSF-1 rodent models of CKD. 
Morphological normalization of multiple nephron structures was accompanied by functiona l 
improvements, including glomerular filtration, tubular protein handling, electrolyte ba lance, and the 
ability to concentrate urine. Lowered blood pressure and reduced levels of circulating r enin were 
also observed in the ZSF-1 rat model. The observed functional improvements following SRC  
treatment were accompanied by significant reductions in glomerular sclerosis , tubular degeneration 
and interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. No toxicologicall y significant in -life, clinical pathology, 
or histological changes were noted in the target organ or other tissues. Based on results fr om 
multiple pre -clinical studies conducted in different CKD animal models, SRC ( i.e., active 
component of REACT ) were effective in significantly delaying progression of CKD when 
implanted in the diseased organ prior to irreversible nephropathy. These results pr ovide a rationale 
for investigating the effects of this cell -based intervention in patients prior to ESRD. 
1.3.2.  Safety Pharmacology 
1.3.2.1.  Extra -Renal Activity  
REACT  (i.e., SRC formulat ed in a gelatin -based hydrogel) was administered in various rat and 
canine models to assess immediate cardiovascular and respi ratory pharmacologic effects. The acute 
effects of lower and higher SRC concentrations formulated in varying percentages  of gelatin (0.75-
1.0%) were evaluated in the rodent 5/6th Nx model. Potential changes in blood pressure we re 
assessed immediately before, during, and shortly after REACT  delivery in the normal canine model. 
No studies on the effects of REACT  on the central nervous system were performed since: 1) 
animals exhibited normal behavior before, during, and after REACT  injection; 2) no effects on the 
central nervous system were expected from an investigational product containing i ntact renal cells; 
and, 3) REACT  was delivere d into the kidney. 
1.3.2.2.  Hemodynamic Effects  
Rats in the 5/6th Nx study (Study #4) received REACT  or vehicle control, and potential 
hemodynamic effects were monitored over 4 days. Among the 77 animals treated in this REACT  
formulation study, 16 animals experienc ed apnea during or immediately after REACT  delivery. A 
total of 9 animals died; the causes of death were classif ied as apnea (n=3), renal hemorrhage (n=2), 
and deaths associated with CKD (n=4). Six of the 16 animals that experienced apnea  were not pre-
treated with atropine; of these animals that experienced apnea, two died under the inf luence of 
anesthesia prior to the use of atropine. Ten of the 16 anima ls that experienced apnea were treated 
with atropine, and all recovered from the surgical procedure and REACT  injection. 
On the other hand, apnea, renal hemorrhage, and deaths that occurred in the 5/6th Nx rat study we re 
not observed in the ZSF-1 rat study, or in the canine pharmacology study, or in two (intact) canine 
pilot studies that assessed the short-term effects of volume administration on bl ood pressure. Taken 
together, this model-specific hemodynamic response can be potentially attributed to:   1) altered 
hemodynamics of the severely mass -reduced rodent remnant kidney  38 2) transient changes in 
kidney interstitial pressure administration triggering a c entral autonomic  response ;39 40 and, 3) under 
perfusion of tissue or acute hypoxia from bleeding following d elivery  into the kidney. Pre- treatment 
Confidential  Page 26 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
with atropine, a competitive antagonist of the parasympathetic nervous system, helped m itigate the 
model-specific hemodynamic changes. The effect of atropine suggests a possible  autonomic 
response to REACT  delivery th at was specific to the severely mass -reduced, 5/6th Nx rodent model 
of CKD.  
1.3.2.3.  Dose Volume  
Using a range of REACT  doses, volumes, and concentrations, (Study #5), the normal canine was 
selected to evaluate blood pressure immediately before, during, and after R EACT  delivery into the 
kidney. In this study, each pole of each kidney received 2.5 mL of REACT ; therefore, a total of  
10 mL/120 g, or 0.083 mL/g, was delivered at a dosage of 12.5 x 106 cells /gram of kidney mass. 
REACT  treatment was well tolerated; there were no adverse syst emic effects (physical or 
serological), nor were there any significant toxicological or histomorphological change s indicative 
of kidney injury or other tissue injury as a result of REACT  delivery. In  contrast to the severe mass 
reduction rodent model of CKD, no apnea, renal hemorrhage, or deaths were noted. 
1.3.3.  Kinetics, Migration, and Persistence  
As with other  cell-base d therapie s targeting sof t organs, dat a on biodistribution of the 
investigationa l produc t has been limited. To tha t end, thre e additiona l studie s provi de evidence 
concerning t he potentia l migration and persistenc e of REACT  within t he kidney a t selected 
sampling  times  post-delivery .24,25,26   The results  of these  studies  are summarized  in this section; 
detailed information is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure . 
1.3.3.1.  ZSF-1 Rat 
SRC s were labeled with t he Rhodamine- B superparamagneti c iron oxid e (SPIO ) particle.  This 
contras t agent is specifically formulated f or cell labeling and i s readily internalized by non- 
phagocyti c cells. SPIO- labeled  cells were  administered  to the ZSF-1 rat kidney. Twenty-f our hours 
after delivery,  SPIO -labeled  cells were detec ted by MR I and whol e organ optica l imaging. In 
addition, ZSF- 1 rats received  SRCs  labeled  with CelSense -19F , which wer e quantified by Nuclear 
Magnetic Resonance at  3 hr., 24 hr., a nd 7 da ys after implantation .24,25 
Both acute ZSF -1 detection and long-ter m donor cell detection using t he 5/6th Nx mode l of CKD 
showed significa nt retention of SPIO- labeled  cells.  Clinically  relevant  MRI detection  at 24  hr. 
following cel l delivery revealed a region a t the anteri or pole of the kidne y wher e SPIO- labeled  cells 
had been injected. Sectioning of t he whol e kidne y and staining with Prussian bl ue demonstrate d a 
bolus of iron labeled SPIO  cells migrating  and distributing  from  the cortical injection  site, which  
confirmed thei r presenc e in tubula r and peritubula r space s of the renal cortex and medulla. 
Likewise, whol e organ fluoresce nt imaging highlighted cel l detection a t and around t he site of 
injection located a t the uppe r cortex of t he anterio r pole of the ZSF-1 ra t kidney. Detection of 19F-
labeled SR C at 3 and 24 hr . after deliver y confirmed nearly 100 % retenti on in the kidney. Afte r 7 
days, detection of 19F-labeled SR C was diminished by an orde r of magnitude, consiste nt with 
conti nuous urinary excretion. 
1.3.3.2.  Porcine Non -GLP Analysi s of Non- Renal  Tissue  
In a pre-clinical, non-GLP study, SPIO-labeled SRC were delivered to the kidneys of l iving swine 
(n=11). Cellular distribution was monitored over the course of the 30-day study period using MRI . 
Labelled SRC wer e distributed in two major compartments:  urinary bladder and renal parenchyma. 
Confidential  Page 27 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
The major route of excretion was urine. Notably, there was no evidence of ectopic SR C migration 
or site -specific engraftment at non -target organ sites .41 
1.3.3.3.  Canine Non -GLP Analysis of Non- Renal Tissue  
In a pre-clinical, non-GLP study, SPIO-labeled SRC were delivered to the kidneys of l iving canine 
hosts. Cellular distribution was monitored at 30 minutes post- injection via MRI. Consistent with 
observa tions from the living porcine model demonstrating that inj ected SPIO -labeled SRC was 
retained in renal parenchyma or excreted in urine, SPIO -labeled SRC likewise were retained within 
the renal parenchyma at the injection site after 30 minutes . 
1.3.3.4.  Conclusions  
•SRC are distributed at the site of injection (renal par enchyma) and excreted via the
urine, based on SRC labeling studies with SPIO and CelSense-19F.
•SRC delivered into rat, swine, and canine kidneys were not detected in non- target organs
(other than urinary tract during excretion), based on extensive histological evaluation.
•Based on reports concerning allogenic mesenchymal stem cell s as well as published data
concerning the safety of autologous mesenchymal stem cells in clinical trials, a utologous
REACT -related materials should also not give rise to ectopic tissue growth, org an
dysfunction, or tumor development .42,43,44,45,46 
1.4. Toxicology Studies
To assess  the safety  of REACT , thre e GLP safet y studie s were conducted, i .e., one  study was 
conducted in t he rat ZSF-1 diseas e mode l of CKD and t he other two studie s were conducted in 
normal canines. A brief summary is presented below; detailed information is provided in the 
Inves tigator’s  Brochure. 
1.4.1.  ZSF-1 Rat Single Dose Study  
The purpose of this study was to assess the safety of a single administration of REACT  in ZSF -1 
rats, a model of uncontrolled metabolic syndrome including T2DM, hypertension, and severe 
obesity. The rats received:  1) high dose REACT ; 2) low dose REACT ; 3) sham; or, 4) biomaterial 
only. Each animal received 4 injections of test article, one into each pole of each kidne y. The results 
were assessed at 3- and 6-months post- treatment.  
1.4.1.1.  Renal -Related Findings  
No tre atment -related kidney findings were noted following evaluation of 8 areas of each kidney (3 
stains per area), including assessment and scoring of 150 glomeruli per kidney. Apart f rom changes 
related to implantation and/or injection site linear scar s, all k idneys were considered normal within 
the context of the disease model. No test article -related kidney finding was observed at 3- or 6-
month post- treatment. All macroscopic and microscopic kidney change s were considered related to 
the natural progression of renal disease in the ZSF -1 obese rat, or to the injection procedure. 
Kidney changes in all groups were more severe in males, and consistent with differe nces in the 
disease stage between genders. Overall, there was an apparent trend of lower  renal histolog ical 
severity scores (i.e. , lower glomerular injury score, tubule- interstitial injury score, and global 
nephron score) that was consistently noted in the low-concentration REACT  treatment group when 
compared to the Sham control group 6 months post-procedur e. 
Confidential  Page 28 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   Based on the absence of differences across study groups, the No-Observed- Adverse- Effect -Level 
(NOAEL) was the high dose, 6.25 x 106 cells /g KWest. 
1.4.1.2.  Non-Renal Findings  
No REACT  safety -related findings were observed in non- target tissues. No ureteral or b ladder 
(primary routes of REACT  excretion) REACT -related changes were observed. There were no 
REACT - related effects, and no observable REACT  cellular materials in any of the draining (lymph 
nodes) or filtering (liver, lung, spleen) tissues examined. 
1.4.1.3.  Clini cal Pathology 
The results of clinical laboratory tests (including hematology, clinical chemis try, and special 
urinalysis panels) were evaluated for differences between baseline a nd end of study (3- or 6-months 
post- treatment), and between treated and contr ol groups. No REACT -related clinically significant 
laboratory abnormalities were identified.  
1.4.1.4.  Conclusions:  
• All animals survived to the end of study (3- or 6-months post- treatment).  
• There were no significant safety -related clinical pathology findings or safety -related 
findings of toxicological significance attributable to treatment.  
• No REACT -related clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were identified.  
• The observed NOAEL was 6.25 x 106 cells /g KWest. 
1.4.2.  Initial Single Dose Canine Study  
The initial canine toxicology study assessed the safety of a single administration of tw o different 
doses of REACT  compared to sham treatment or treatment with the biomaterial.  The test article was 
delivered into one pole of each kidney. A total of 32 mongrel dogs were entered into the study; 16 
were assessed at one month and 16 were assessed at 3 months.  
1.4.2.1.  General Results  
All 32 animals survived to their designated termination time point at one or 3 months aft er 
treatment. The animals appeared to be in good health throughout the study. There were no 
significant clinical pathology findings. There were no signs of renal insufficiency (a zotemia), and 
there were no indications of decreased GFR. 
1.4.2.2.  Renal -Related Results  
No REACT  delivery -related macroscopic or micros copic findings were observed at the one- or 3-
month endpoint. No treatment-related kidney findings were noted following enhanced evalu ation of 
8 areas of each kidney (3 stains per area), including evaluation and scoring of 150 glomerul i per 
kidney. Apart f rom changes related to injection site scars all kidneys were n ormal. All macroscopic 
and microscopic kidney changes were considered background findings or related to the i njection 
procedures. 
1.4.2.3.  Non-Renal Findings  
No test article -related findings were identified in other (non-kidney) tissues. All macroscop ic and 
microscopic changes were considered background changes and within normal limit s. 
Confidential  Page 29 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   1.4.2.4.  Procedure -Related Findings  
The most common abnormalities included swelling at the incisio n sites (seroma formation) and 
weight loss at study termination. With regard to incision site swelling, ten of sixtee n (10/16) 
animals had sterile seroma formation post-implantation, and nine of sixteen (9/ 16) post treatment. 
The animals had varying degrees of swelling at their retroper itoneal incisions and were treated as 
deemed necessary by a veterinarian.  
Numerous animals had mild inappetence following REACT  administration (29 of 32) and treatment 
procedures (18 of 32). Most animals (28 of 32) experienced weight loss from baseline  (prior to 
implantation) to termination. Of note, a greater amount of weight loss occurred bet ween baseline (2 
weeks prior to treatment) and treatment (Day 0; renal injecti ons) than between treatment and 
termination. Weight loss also occurred across all treatm ent groups and was judged to be related to 
the stressful nature of the study. 
1.4.2.5.  Conclusions  
• All animals survived to their designated termination time point and were in good general  
health throughout the study based on clinical pathology, urinalysis, and vete rinary 
assessment.  
• Neither the low or high dose of REACT  produced macroscopic or microscopic adverse 
effects at one- or 3-months post- treatment, similar to observations following sham 
treatment or treatment with the biomaterial.  
• Pathological evaluation showed no REACT  safety -related (macroscopic or microscopic) 
findings in the target (kidney) or non-target organs examined. 
• Based on anatomic pathology, the observed NOAEL was the higher concentration 
tested, i.e. , 11.7 x 106 cells/g KWest. 
1.4.3.  Repeat Dose Canine Study  
The second canine toxicology study assessed the safety of administering two repeat dos es of 
REACT . Each dose was delivered into both kidneys at baseline (time zero) and 3 months. All 
animals were subjected to two renal biopsies per kidney 4 to 6 weeks prior t o the baseline injection 
procedure. Control animals were injected with PBS. Animals were monitored for 6 m onths 
following the baseline injection. 
1.4.3.1.  Study Results  
All 8 animals were in good clinical health throughout the study and survived to their d esignated 
termination time point at 6 months. There was mild or insignificant weight loss in 5 of 8 a nimals, 
with 2 animals losing >3% body weight for the duration of the study. Greater weight loss occu rred 
between the renal implantation and initial treatment than betw een the initial treatment and 
termination. The clinical pathology and urinalysis data revealed no abnormal trends . There were no 
signs of renal insufficiency, and no indications of decreased GFR. 
1.4.3.2.  Kidney -Related Findings  
No REACT  implantation s afety -related macroscopic or microscopic findings were observed at the 
6-month time point.  No treatment-related kidney findings were noted following enhance d 
evaluation of 8 areas of each kidney (3 stains per area), including evaluation and scori ng of 150 
glomeruli per kidney. All kidneys appeared normal, apart from changes related to inj ection site 
Confidential  Page 30 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   scars (fibrosis/chronic inflammation in the capsule; lin ear fibrosis/chronic inflammation and 
inflammatory cells in the cortex/medulla).  
1.4.3.3.  Non-Kidney Related Fin dings  
No test article safety -related findings were identified in non- target tissues. All macroscopic and 
microscopic changes were considered background changes and thus, considered within norma l 
limits.  
1.4.3.4.  Conclusions  
• All animals survived to their designated termination time point, and appeared in good 
health based on clinical pathology, urinalysis, and veterinary assessment data. 
• Pathological assessment showed no REACT  safety -related (macroscopic or microscopic) 
findings in either the target organ (kidney) or non-target organs examined. 
• At the 6 -month time point, no detrimental effects of two repeat doses of REACT  were 
observed in comparison to the control animals injected with PBS. 
1.5. Non-clinical Conclusions  
Evidence from multiple animal studies over a wide range of doses (3 to 15 million SRC/g of kidney 
tissue implanted), and extended periods of time post- REACT  treatment (up to one year), including 
three GLP studies, indicates that the potential risk of co mplications from REACT  delivery into the 
kidney is similar to the potential risk of complications associated with standar d renal biopsy 
practice .47,48,49 
Apart from changes related to injection procedures and cardiovascular findi ngs specific to 5/6th 
nephrectomy rodent mass reduction model of CKD, no unanticipated in- life, hematological, 
urological, serological, or histological changes were found in the target organ or non- target tissues 
following delivery of REACT . 
1.6. Phase 1 Clinical Trial: Interim Results  
1.6.1.  Background 
In April 2013, a first- in-human clinical trial was initiated at the Karolinska Univ ersity Hospital 
Huddinge in Stockholm, Sweden: A Phase 1, Open-Label Safety and Delivery Optimization St udy 
of Renal Autologous Cell Therapy ( REACT ) in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease 
(RMTX -CL001). This is a Phase 1, open-label, safety and delivery optimization study of REACT  
implanted into subjects with CKD. REACT  will be manufactured from SRC obtained from a 
subject’s renal biopsy, formulated with gelatin biomaterial, and injected back into the subject’s left 
kidney. The primary objective is to assess the safety and optimal delivery of REACT  implanted at 
one site in a recipient kidney as measured by procedure- and/or product- related adverse events 
(AEs) through 12 months post- treatment. The secondary objective is to asses s renal function by 
comparing the results of laboratory tests from baseline through 12 months following REACT  
injection, followed by an additional observational period of 18 months. Each subject’s ba seline rate 
of CKD disease progression serves as his/her own “control” to monitor for changes i n renal 
insufficiency over time. Six subjects, recruited from the Karolinska Universit y Hospital, were 
enrolled into the study. In addition, one subject was enrolled in the study at the University of Nor th 
Carolina.

1.6.2.  Adverse Events  
Among a cohort of 7 male subjects, 53 to 70 years of age, with pre-dialysis diabetic nephropat hy 
(Stage 3b/4 of CKD), all subjects recovered from the laparoscopic REACT  delivery procedure 
without immediate  perioperative  complications.  Notably,  no subject experienced hematuria, which 
was prospectively considered to be the most likely untoward event. One subject develope d an 
intestinal volvulus on Day 2 after REACT  injection, and required a partial colonic resection that 
was complicated  by anasto motic hemorrhage. In the judgment of the Investigator, this event was not 
related to the investigational product or the procedure. One subject experienced a skin infection that 
was associated with the laparoscopic implantation procedure. Another subject re covered from the 
surgical procedure with inflammation of the respiratory tract. All serious adverse events (SAEs) 
associated  with the clinical trial are  presented  in Table  6. 
Eight of the nine SAEs were considered possibly related to the implant surgery. There w ere no AEs 
or SAEs considered related to the biopsy procedure. To date, no delayed or late- onset  adverse 
reactions  related  to REACT  or other study procedures have been identified (e.g., negative immune 
mediated reactions). Based on the current data, the highest risk associated with R EACT  treatment 
appears to be from the implant surgery. Consequently, steps are being taken to decreas e the duration 
of the surgical procedure and improve surgical outcomes.

1.6.3.  Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)  
Seven male patients with T2DM and Stage 3b/4 of CKD were implanted with REACT  in the left 
kidney. Pre- implantation information from these subjects indicated th at their average decline in 
eGFR was 6.1 ml/min/year. Following REACT  treatment, eGFR decline for  the combined group 
(all subjects) was -3.1 ml/min/year (green line in  Figure 1 ).

 scarring  as the disease progresses.  An increase in  cortical  thickness  was associated  with kidney  
regeneration in pre-cl inical studies  of REACT  and was confirmed  histologically  in all 4 animal 
species studied (refer to the Investigator’s Brochure ). In the clinical trials TNG -CL010 and TN G-
CL011, cortica l thicknes s was evaluated using imaging technologies ; no biopsie s were taken to 
confir m the basis for the increased thickness. Cortica l thicknes s was measured in both t he right and 
left kidney  to determine  if the impla nted lef t kidney exhibited any chang e in cortica l thicknes s that 
could be attributed to R EACT  implantation. T he right kidney served a s a non-implanted control. 
On average, cortica l thicknes s increased in t he left kidney fr om 14 m m at baseli ne to approximat ely 
16 mm after one year of REACT  treatment.  This change  in cortical thickness  was not sufficient  to 
cause an increas e in the total volum e of the left kidney (dat a not presented). No cha nge in cortical 
thicknes s was observed in t he right kidney cortex. 
1.6.5.  Hemoglobin 
CKD can be associated wit h anemia due to an alteration in renal erythropoietin production as well 
as metabolic abnormalities resulting from chronic uremia .50   In the clinical trial RMTX - CL001, 3 
of 7 subjects exhibited improvement in hemoglobin le vels after REACT  treatment, while the 
remaining 4 subjects maintained normal levels during the study. 
1.6.6.  Blood Pressure  
Blood pressure was monitored during the course of clinical trials TNG-CL010 and TNG -CL011. 
Subjects received medication to control their blood pressure. Notably, intake of ant ihypertensive 
medication was reduced in 3 of 6 subjects during the first six months following REACT  treatment .51 
1.7. Potential Risks  
In general, potential risks associated with the clinical use  of REACT  can be broadly divided into 3 
categories:  kidney biopsy, REACT  product, and delivery into the recipient kidney. An assessment 
of potential risks associated with each of these steps is  presented in this Section. 
At this time, there are no specific warnings or precautions associated with the  use of REACT . 
However, warnings and precautions for the renal biopsy and the percutaneous inject ion procedure 
must be considered with use of this product. The risks of renal biopsy have been well ch aracterized 
in the 100 years that this procedure has been used and developed. Percutaneous needle 
instrumentation of the kidney has a shorter history. 
The risks of renal biopsy and percutaneous needle kidney injection include: 
1.Pain in flank / injection/biopsy site
2. Bleeding at injection/biopsy site which may occur around the kidney or anywhere along the
needle track and which may be sufficient to entail clinically significant anemi a, acute kidney
injury (AKI), hematoma, and in the case of subcapsular bleeding, a “Page kidney” a nd acute
hypertension
3. Surgical damage to the kidney from needle injury, as well as injuries of other struc tures that
include connective tissues, bone, and intra-abdominal viscera
1.7.1.  Potential  Risks Associated with Renal Biopsy  
Autologous kidney cells will be obtained from individual subjects via a kidney biopsy perf ormed 
according to standard medical practice  47,48,49 and consistent with standard operating procedures at 
participating hospitals /medical institutions. A minimum  of 2 tissue cores from a single kidney 
Confidential  Page 35 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
biopsy is needed to obtain sufficient renal cortical tissue for the production of REACT . A 16-gauge 
biopsy needle measuring approximately 10 mm in length will remove 0.01-0.02% of the average 
total volume of the diseased kidney. Since approximately 0.001% of the total number of renal 
glomeruli will be harvested ,49   the biopsy is not expected to adversely affect kidney function. 
Kidney biopsies for diagnostic procedures are of low risk and often conducted under sedat ion on an 
outpatient basis in the US .52,53  When performed by qualified interventional physicians, a renal 
biopsy properly targeted towards the cortex produces limited renal damage .45   On the other hand, 
reports of kidney damage at the biopsy site describe vascular injury and varying degrees  of 
ischemia and infarction. The severity of damage depends on the size and number of vesse ls injured 
during the biopsy procedure .54 
Hemorrhage is the most common AE associated with a rou tine kidney biopsy. Nearly all patients 
experience microscopic hematuria as a result of the b iopsy, but this is not clinically significant .48,53
On the other hand, gross hematuria occurs in 3-9% of patients ,52,53 and generally resolves by 24 hr. 
post-biopsy. The most serious complication is severe bleeding that requires transfus ion and/or 
results in patient death. Transfusions are needed in less than 1% of renal biopsie s, and death occurs 
in less than 0.01% of cases .55,56,57 
1.7.2.  Potential Risks Associated with REACT  Product  
The investigationa l product, R EACT , is composed of autol ogous renal cells obtained fr om the same 
subjec t via kidney biopsy. Based on experienc e with autol ogous stem cell transplantation, t he risk 
of an imm une respons e (e.g., graf t rejecti on) caused by R EACT  injection into t he kidney seems 
unlikely. 
Since the kidney i s a highly perfused organ, i t is doubtf ul that the implanted SR C will remain 
localized  at the  injection  site. The three  locations  considered  to be the most likely  destinations  of 
migrated  SRC  are: 1) the sub-capsular  space;  2) the systemic circulation;  and, 3) the urinary  tract.  
Leakag e of SRC into t he sub-capsular  space is  not expected  to pose a risk  to the subject. 
For example, t he sub-capsula r space is commonly used to impla nt endocrin e tissue, such a s islet 
cells.58 The renal capsule  also serves  as a niche  for native  stem cells capable  of migrating  into the 
renal  parenchyma .59   Additionally,  direct injection  into the kidney  mitigates  the possibl e entry of 
SRC into the systemi c circulation by providing a natura l route of elimination vi a the urinary tract. 
Furthermore, intrave nous administration of heterologous, allogenei c stem cells (i.e., mesenchymal  
stem  cells)  has been  evaluated  in clinical trials  and yielded  no significant  risk to subjects .42,43,44,45,46 
Porcine Skin T ype B gelatin used in t he formulation of REACT  meets  Pharmaceutical  and Edible 
Gelatin Monograph (European Pharmacopei a 7.0, US Pharmacopeia-Nationa l Formular y USP35 
NF30) requirements. Gelatin i s widely used in pharmaceutica l and medica l applications, including 
cellular transplantation f or regenerati ve products . Gelatin would not be expected to caus e adverse 
effect s in study subject s based on it s biocompatibl e nature, widespread use, and result s of GLP 
toxicology studies with REACT -containing porcine gelatin. Additional information on the porcine 
gelatin used to manufacture REACT  is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.7.3.  Potential Risks Associated with REACT  Treatment  
A percutaneous technique will be used to access the kidney for REACT  delivery. The percutaneous 
approach has been used for over a decade in ablation of renal masses. A concise review  of this 
method can be found in Salagierski and Salagierski (2010) .60   Safety measures will be executed 
Confidential  Page 36 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   during REACT  treatment and post-surgical follow-up to reduce the potential for excessive ble eding 
and other AEs. Patients will be closely monitored as discussed in Section  6. 
Cain and coworkers (1976 )61 reported that renal cell homogenates injected into rodent kidneys 
produced no significant AEs. Similarly, the observed morphological effects following REACT  
delivery into the kidney were consistent with those reported for repeated kidney biopsie s taken from 
canines, i.e. , the presence of a mature connective tissue track with no functional deficits  linked to 
minimal structural changes .54  Increasing intracapsular kidney water volume in canines can ele vate 
intra-kidney pressure as well as transient increases in kidney weight and systemic blood 
pressure .39,40  However, in the pilot canine studies that assessed the short- term effects of volume 
administration on blood pressure, there were no adverse effects on blood pressure f ollowing volume 
escalation up to 6 mL per kidney of REACT . 
1.8. Potential Benefits  
The potential to achieve clinically significant improvement in CKD is supporte d by studies that 
tested REACT  in pre-clinical animal models of kidney insufficiency, i.e., surgical models for 
decreased kidney function in otherwise healthy rats and dogs plus the ZSF-1 rat model of T2D M. 
The main finding was that REACT  significantly decreased the rate of structural and functional 
deterioration in already compromised kidneys to an extent that was clinically relevant  in the animal 
model. Therefore, the potential exists for subjects participa ting in this clinical trial to realize 
therapeutic benefit from REACT  treatment, such as a possible reduction in the rate of progression 
of CKD.

   2. PHASE II TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE  
ProKidney is currently developing a regenerative cell -based product, Renal Autologous Cell 
Therapy ( REACT ), with the aim of improving renal function in subjects who have CKD and 
T2DM. Therapeutic intervention with REACT  is intended to delay the need for re nal replacement 
therapy (dialysis or transplant) which, based on the current standard-of- care, is inevitable for 
patients  with end-stage CKD. The purpose of the present study is to compare the safety and ef ficacy 
of up to 2 injections of REACT  given 6 mont hs (+ 4 weeks) apart (maximum). Each subject’s 
annual rate of renal decline, based on adequate historical clinical data from  24 months prior to the 
Screening Visit, will serve as a comparator to monitor the rate of progress ion of renal insufficiency. 
We propose that REACT  treatment will reduce the rate (slope) of eGFR decline and  improve renal 
function over the 24- month  period following the last REACT  injection.  
2.1. Primary Objective  
To assess the safety of REACT  injected in one recipient kidney. 
• Primary Endpoint: Procedure and/or product related AEs through 24 months post-
injection.  
2.2. Secondary Objective  
To assess the safety and tolerability of REACT  administration by assessing renal- specific AEs over 
a 24-month period following injection. 
• Secondary Endpoints: Renal -specific laboratory assessments through 24 months post 
injection.  
2.3. Exploratory Objective  
To assess the impact of REACT  on renal function over a 24-month period following injection. 
• Exploratory Endpoint: Clinical diagnostic and laboratory assessments of renal structure 
and function (including eGFR, serum creatinine, and proteinuria) to assess changes i n 
the rate of progression of renal disease.

3. INVESTIGATIONAL  PRODUCT
3.1. Description  of Study  Drug
REACT  is an injectable product composed of SRC formulated in a biomaterial (gelatin-ba sed 
hydrogel).  Table  9 presents an overview of the investigational product. Refer to the Investigator’s  
Brochure for a detailed description of SRC and RE ACT  as well as the manufacturing  process. 
Table 9: Investigational Product 
Investigational Product  
Product Name:  Renal Autologous Cell Therapy ( REACT ) 
Dosage Form:  Renal cells obtained from autologous kidney biopsy tissue will be 
expanded and SRC selected. SRC will be formulated in a 
gelatin -based hydrogel at a concentration of 100 x 106 cells/mL.  
This sterile cell preparation ( REACT ) will be contained in a 
sterile 10 mL syringe and shipped to the clinical site for use. 
Unit Dose  The dose of REACT  will be adjusted to 3 x 106 cells/g 
estimated kidney weight determined from MRI study. 
Route of Administration  Percutaneous injection into the cortex of the biopsied kidney 
Physical Description  Sterile, labelled, 10 mL syringe containing up to 8 mL of REACT  
Manufacturer  ProKidney, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA 
3.2. Procurement and Manufacture of REACT  
REACT  will be manufactured in a GMP facility at ProKidney located in Winston-Salem, North 
Carolina, USA. 
3.2.1.  Biopsy 
The biopsy material will be collected using standard surgical techniques to as sess the left or right 
kidney. A minimum of 2 tissue cores each measuring in 1.5cm must be collected using a 16-gauge 
biopsy needle to provide sufficient material for the manufacture of autologous REACT . When the 
biopsy material is received at ProKidney, the samples will be labeled and strict documentation 
measures followed to insure that product traceability is m aintain ed. ProKidney will notify the site 
concerning the adequacy and quality of the biopsy sample for the manufacture of REACT  and 
confirm the scheduled date for REACT  injection. If the biopsy material cannot be used, the subject 
should be discontinued from the study. 
3.2.2.  Selection of SRC  
Approximately 4 weeks prior to the subject’s planned REACT  treatment, autologous renal cells will 
be removed from the vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen freezer, thawed, and isolated from ki dney 
tissue by enzymatic digestion. Cells will be cultured and expanded using standard techni ques. 
The cell culture medium is designed to expand primary renal cells and does not contain any 
differentiation factors. Harvested renal cells will be subjected to densit y gradient separation to 
obtain SRC, which are composed primarily of renal epithelial cells known for thei r regenerative 
Confidential  Page 39 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   potential .62   Other parenchymal (vascular) and stromal (collecting duct) c ells may be sparsely 
present in the autologous SRC population. 
If sufficient cells are available, the same biopsy mater ial will be used to make additional REACT  
preparations for research studies and stored, under GMP conditions, in the vapor phase of  a liquid 
nitrogen freezer.  
It is anticipated that all subjects will r eceive a series of 2 REACT  injections. The time and events 
table shows that the series of 2 REACT  injections will be administered 6 months apart with a study 
visit window of 4 weeks. Regardless, every attempt should be made to ensure that the second  
REACT  injection is administered 6 months after the first injection . ProKidney will notify the 
site to obtain information about the scheduled date for the second injection. 
3.2.3.  Formulation 
SRC will be formulated in a gelatin -based hydrogel to improve stability during transport and 
delivery upon injection into the renal cortex. Porcine gelatin will be dissolved in buff er to form the 
thermally responsive hydrogel. Although fluid at room temperature, this biomaterial gel s when 
cooled to refrigerated temperature (2 to 8ºC). Prior to injection, the REACT  investigational product 
must be warmed to ≥20C up to 26 °C to liquefy the hydrogel. 
3.2.4.  REACT  Product for Injection  
Ten to 14 days prior to the scheduled date for REACT  injection, the subject will report to the clinic 
and undergo assessments to verify continued eligibility. If the subject does not qualify for  REACT  
injection, the Investigator and the Sponsor will discuss possible options, for example, i f there is 
sufficient stability to attempt an REACT  injection at a future date. If the subject still qualifi es, the 
REACT  product will be manufactured and shipped to the clinical center. It is the responsibil ity of 
the site to ensure REACT  shipments can be delivered directly to site personnel. REACT  will be 
injected into the biopsied kidney of eligible subjects using a percutaneous approach. Th e 
percutaneous method will employ a standardized technique (such as that utilized in the a blation of 
renal masses by radiofrequency or cryogenic methods) .60 
It is anticipated that all subjects will receive two p lanned REACT  injections. However, if there 
appears to be any untoward safety risk, or rapid deterioration of renal function, or developm ent of 
uncontrolled diabetes or uncontrolled hypertension, or development of a malignancy or an 
intercurrent  infection , then the second REACT  injection should not be administered. 
Renal cells that may have been frozen but not used to manufacture REACT  will be remain in the 
vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen freezer at ProKidney until the EOS Visit. At that time, if these renal 
cells are no longer needed, they will be de-identified of all personal information a nd stored in the 
vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen freezer for a maximum of 5 years. Th e aim is to test these renal 
cells in laboratory research studies. During the informed consent process, each subj ect must provide 
written consent for the storage and future use of autologous cells not used for REACT  injection. 
Subjects must have the option of having these cells destroyed upon study completion. 
3.2.5.  REACT  Dose  
The dose of REACT  for subjects in the Phase 1 clinical trials (TNG -CL010 and TNG- CL011) was 
3 x 106 SRC /g estimated kidney weight (g KWest). Similarly, in the present study, each REACT  
injection will contain 3 x 106 cells/g KWest. Since the concentration of SRC is 100 x 106 cells/mL of 
REACT , the dosing volume will be 3.0 mL for each 100 g of kidney weight. The volume of 
REACT  to be administered will be determined by pre-procedure MRI volum etric 3D evaluation or 
Confidential  Page 40 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 ellipsoid formula (Length x width AP plane x width Transverse plan x .62). Examples of 
dosing volumes based on estimated kidney weight are shown in  Table  10.

Notes:  
a.The dose of REACT  will be 3 x 106 cells/g estimated kidney weight.
b.Kidney weight will be estimated from an MRI study p erformed before renal biopsy.
c.8 mL will be the maximum dosing volume (mL).
The dose of REACT  will be based on kidney volume calculated via MRI. In contrast to other 
methods, measurements of renal volume using MRI are more accurate, and acquire tru e 
tomographic data along any orientation without the risk of ionizing radiation or nephrotoxic 
contra st agents. Renal volume measurements (mL) estimated from M RI are approximately 92 to 
97% of dry weight measurements in grams for isolated organs trimmed of perirenal f at. As a 
conservative approach, the REACT  dose will be calculated using a conversion of one g equals one 
mL. The volume of REACT  to be administered will be determined by pre- procedure MRI 
volumetric 3D evaluation or ellipsoid formula (Length x width AP plane x width Transverse  plan x 
.62). This ensures that subjects will not receive REACT  doses higher than those previously tested in 
animal studies.  
3.2.5.1.  Rationale for Two REACT  Injections  
It is anticipated that all subjects will receive two p lanned REACT  injections to allow dose-finding 
and evaluate the duration of effects. The scientific ratio nale, based on non- clinical studies, is that 
the biologically active component of REACT  (homologous, autologous, SRC) delays progression of 
experimental models of CKD by augmenting renal structure and function .18,19,33,34 ,35,36   As a result, 
the more cells that can be infused, the greater the potential improvement in renal  function. 
The total number of cells that can be delivered into a kidney at one time is limited by the size of the 
kidney, however, as well as the inelasticity of the renal capsule. Consequently, it may be possible to 
improve therapeutic benefit by administering greater numbers of SRC via a second i njection, given 
after cells from the first injection have become incorporated into the kidney. 
Apart from increasing SRC numbers by administering 2 REACT  injections into the same kidney, 
the duration of effects can be evaluated. The processes by which functional nephrons be come 
disabled in kidneys with CKD may, over time, adversely affect “new” cells delivere d via REACT  
Confidential  Page 41 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
injection. Consequently, R EACT  might not resul t in long-term, therapeuti c benefit. Exploring the 
effects  from  a second  REACT  injection, given a t an appropriat e interva l after the first injection, 
would addres s this question. 
In the prese nt study, subject s will be administere d a second R EACT  injection 6 mont hs after the 
first injection,  with a study  visit window of 4 weeks. Regardless, every  attempt  should be  made  to 
ensure  that the second R EACT  injection  is administered  6 months  after  the first injection . In 
the event that the subjec t cannot schedul e his/he r second R EACT  injection  6 months  after the first 
injection, ProKidney a nd the Medical Monitor  must be  notified  immediately.  
However, i f there appear s to be any untoward safety risk, or rapid deterioration of rena l function, or 
developme nt of uncontrolled diabete s or uncontrolled hypertension, or developme nt of a 
malignancy or an intercurre nt infection, then t he second R EACT  injecti on should not be 
administered.  
3.2.5.2.  Safety of Two R EACT  Injections  
To asses s the safety of administering two dose s of REACT  into t he biopsie d kidney, a canin e GLP  
toxicology study wa s conducted (Refe r to Section  1.4.2 ). Simila r to the clinica l study design, study 
animal s (n=8) underwe nt renal biopsie s at 4 to 6 wee ks prior to baseline . Each dos e was delivered  
into both kidne ys at baseli ne and 3 months ; animal s were observe d for 6 mont hs following the 
baseli ne injection. Whil e contr ol animal s receive d PBS, R EACT -treated  animals  received  a two -
fold greate r dose than tha t used in t he prese nt clinica l study. 
Briefly, no detrimenta l effect s of two dose s of REACT  into t he biopsied kidney wer e observed in 
comparison to contr ol animal s 6 mont hs after baseli ne treatment. Pathologica l assessme nt showed 
no R EACT  safety- relate d (macroscopi c or microscopic ) findi ngs in eithe r the targe t organ (kidney) 
or non-target  organs  examined.  No treatment -related kidney findi ngs were noted following 
enhanced evaluation of 8 area s of each kidney (3 stai ns per area), including assessme nt and scoring 
of 150 glomerul i per kidney. Al l kidne ys appeared normal, apar t from change s related to injection 
site scars. There were no signs of renal insufficiency, and no indications of decreased GFR.

3.3. Study Drug Packaging  
The product delivery system consists of 3 components: 
1. 10 mL standard, Luer- Lok® syringe
2. Package for containment of the syringe
3.REACT  shipping container for transportation of the package to the clinical site
The syringe containing REACT  will be shipped to the clinical site encased in a package designed to 
maintain integrity of the product as well as sterility of the product and syringe. A re presentative 
image of the product delivery system is shown in  Figure 3.

   autologous subjects, the number of stored specimens remaining at ProKidney LLC, and disposa l of 
unused materials.  
3.5.2.  Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
Since transmission of HIV and other blood-borne pathogens can occur through contact with 
contaminated needles, blood, and blood products; appropriate blood and secretion precautions  will 
be employed by all personnel in the shipping and handling of all specimens for this study, as 
currently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Nat ional 
Institutes of Health.  
All material containin g investigational drug product will be treated and disposed of as hazardous 
waste in accordance with governing regulations and clinical site  procedures.  
3.5.2.1.  Disposition of Stored Specimens  
Specimens will be stored in the vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen freeze r at ProKidney. Only 
Investigators or suitably qualified  individuals who have received appropriate study- specific training 
and whose names are listed on the Delegation of Responsibility Log will have access  to these 
specimens.  
3.5.2.2.  Unused Specimens  
Renal cells that may have been frozen but not used to manufacture REACT  will be remain in the 
vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen freezer at ProKidney until the EOS Visit. At that time, if these renal 
cells are no longer needed, they will be de-identified of all personal information a nd stored in the 
vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen freezer for a maximum of 5 years. The aim is to test t hese renal 
cells in laboratory research studies.  
During the informed consent process, each subject must be provided the option not to store or use 
their unused renal cells  and research samples (as described in  Table  2), and must provide written 
consent for the storage and future use of autologous cells not used for REACT  injection  if they 
consent to the long-term storage of unused specimens. Additionally, subjects may decide a t any 
point during the study not to have their unused renal cells stored. In this case, the Investigator will 
destr oy all known remaining samples attributed to that subject and report what was done to both t he 
subject and to the IRB. Likewise, subjects must have the option of having their cells de stroyed upon 
completion of the study.

   4.3. Number of Subjects  
Up to 10 subjects who complete screening procedures and satisfy all inclusion a nd exclusion criteria 
will be enrolled.  
4.4. Treatment Compliance  
Eligible subjects will receive their autologous REACT  preparations via a series of up to two 
injections.  The investigational product will be administered into the biop sied kidney using a 
percutaneous approach. REACT  product preparation and dosing procedures are specified in this 
protocol as well as the Stud y Reference Manual.  
It is anticipated that all subjects will receive two REACT  injections. In some cases, a subject or the 
Investigator may elect to delay or withhold the second REACT  injection. For example, if there 
appears to be any untoward safety risk, or if the subject’s health status would, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, be jeopardized, then the second REACT  injection should not be administered. 
4.5. Study Duration  
Subjects will begin their series of REACT  injection(s) as soon as the autologous REACT  
preparation is made available. Assuming a one- month interval prior to the first REACT  injection, 
and assuming a 6-month interval before the second injection, plus a 24-month follow-up period 
after the final injection, the study duration would be: 
• 31 month s for a series of 2 REACT  injections

highly effective method(s) of birth control, includin g sexual abstinence. Or, the female 
subject is unwilling to continue using a highly effective method of birth control throughout 
the duration of the study.  
Note: A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one that results in a l ow 
failure rate (i.e. , less than one percent per year) when used consistently and correctly, such 
as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine  devices IUDs, 
sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized partner.  
24. The subject has a history of active alcohol and/or drug abuse that, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, would impair the subject’s ability to comply with the protocol.

participating in the study. 
26. The subject has used an investigational product within 3 months prior to REACT  injection 
without receiving written consent from the Medical Monitor. 
5.3. Prohibited and Concomitant Medications  
• The consumption of NSAIDs (including aspirin) as well as clopidogrel, prasugr el, or other 
platelet inhibitors is prohibited during the study beginning 7 days before through 7 days 
after both the renal biopsy and REACT  injection(s).  
• Aspirin, up to a dose of 100 mg/day, may be continued if doing so is the standard of care at 
the investigational site, for subjects with  diabetes who are greater than 40 years of age or 
have additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease or stroke, and for whom the  perceived 
benefits of aspirin therapy outweigh the risks associated wit h treatment.  
• Intake of fish oil and platelet aggregation inhibitors, such as dipryridamole ( i.e., Persantine), 
is prohibited during the study beginning 7 days before through 7 days after both the renal 
biopsy and REACT  injection(s).  
Confidential  Page 51 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   • Subjects who are undergoing treatment with an ACEI or an ARB must have initiated t herapy 
at least 8 weeks prior to renal biopsy. Treatment must be stable during the  6-week period 
immediately prior to REACT  injection. Stable treatment is defined as dose adjustment no 
less than one-half of the current dosage and no more than 2 times the current dosage. In 
addition, except where medically necessary, no changes should be made to the ACEI or 
ARB dosing regimen from Screening through the 24-month EOS Visit. Dose interruptions 
up to 7 d ays due to medical necessity are allowed.  
• Medications that interfere with measurements of SCr should be avoided during the st udy, 
such as trimethoprim, dronedarone, and cimetidine. If such medications are requir ed based 
on medical necessity, then the circu mstance should be discussed with the Medical Monitor 
and documented within the CRF. 
• Use of investigational drugs is prohibited during the course of the study, unless preap proved 
by the Medical Monitor. Investigational drugs are defined as drugs that have not bee n 
approved for use by the FDA. 
5.4. Subject Withdrawal Criteria  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without penalty or prejudice, 
and without jeopardizing access to future medical care. If the Investigat or determines that 
continuing in the study is no longer in the best interest of the subject, then the Investigator  should 
withdraw the subject from the study. If a subject voluntarily withdraws from t he study, the reason(s) 
should be documented. Subjects who withdraw from the study or are withdrawn by the Inve stigator 
should undergo procedures specified at the EOS Visit. 
If a subject withdraws from the study before having the renal biopsy, the subject  will be considered 
a screen failure. If a subject withdraws from the study following the renal b iopsy but before the first 
REACT  injection, the subject will not be a screen failure, but will not be consi dered enrolled and 
may be replaced. If a subject withdraws from the study after REACT  injection but before the end of 
the follow-up period, the subject cannot be replaced. 
Patients that do not meet I/E criteria on the RMCL -002 protocol but had a biopsy may be enrolled 
into REGEN -003.  Patients that have completed a biopsy in RMCL-002 will not undergo another 
biopsy if they enroll in REGEN -003.

   6. STUDY VISITS  
The schedules of clinical assessments and procedures to be performed during t he study ar e 
displayed in the time and events tables, i.e., Table  1. Similarly, the schedules of sample collection 
and clinical laboratory evaluations planned for the study are displayed in the laboratory t ime and 
events tables, i.e., Table 2. Before conducting any study specific assessments or procedures 
(including screening), the subject must provide written informed consent in accordanc e with ICH 
GCP guidelines and 21 CFR Part 50. 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic that began in March 2020, subject follow-up visits may be 
conducted remotely or via home health services to ensure the safety of the subject. Any pr ocedures 
listed in the schedule of events that are not completed due to COVID- 19 pandemic restrictions will 
be documented as protocol deviations. Clinical laboratory evaluations are permitt ed to be completed 
by a local lab convenient for the subject. Results of all evaluations performed by loc al laboratories 
will be collected by ProKidney. 
6.1. Screening  
All screening assessments should take place in a timeframe  that will allow for scheduling of the 
renal biopsy within 60 days of the Screening Visit.  
Renal ultrasound will be performed at the Screening Visit to veri fy subject eligibility ( i.e., no 
evidence of renal tumors, polycystic kidney disease, renal cysts or other anatomic  abnormalities that 
would interfere with the REACT  injection procedure) along with obtaining a baseline echogenicity 
reading. Additionally, a MRI study without contrast will be performed from the time  of Screening 
Visit through Day -1 before renal biopsy to determine kidney size and volume. 
To qualify for study enrollment, the subject’s eGFR must be between 14 and 20 mL/min/1.73m2 
inclusive at the Screening Visit. To define the eGFR for entry criteria, the site should use the  eGFR 
assessed during screening and calculate using the CKD- EPI equation .63 
If a subject does not meet a specific eligibility crit erion, but the Investigator believes that the 
subject would be an excellent candidate for the clinical tri al, then that criterion may be reassessed 
one time. In general, a subject who does not qualify may be rescreened once as long as the 
Investigator has sufficient clinical justification. If the Investigator has any questions concerning the 
appropriateness of rescreening a subject, then the Investigator should contact the  Medical Monitor. 
If, for whatever reason, the biopsy cannot be conducted within 60 days of the Screening Visi t, then 
the Investigator and Medical Monitor should discuss and agree upon the need for repeating t he 
screening assessments on a case -by-case basis. For example, laboratory assessments performed 
between 1 and 3 days before the renal biopsy mig ht be used in place of the screening assessments to 
satisfy final eligibility criteria. In other cases, it may not be appropriate or necessary to repeat the 
clinical diagnostic procedures, including ECG or MRI studies. 
6.2. Biopsy  
The biopsy should be scheduled within 60 days of the Screening Visit. The biopsy should take pla ce 
in a time frame that will allow for scheduling of the fir st REACT  injection approximately one 
month later. Due to shipping and manufacturing schedules, the preferred day for collecting th e renal 
biopsy cores is on a Wednesday or Thursday. Biopsies should not be collected on a Friday. 
Subjects will report to the hospital or clinical research center one to three d ays before the biopsy for 
pre-biopsy assessments. As much as possible, pre-biopsy laboratory samples may be collected and 
Confidential  Page 53 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   assessed to verify continued eligibility. After admission and final verification of  inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, the biopsy should be performed as described in Section  7.5.1.  
A minimum of 2 biopsy cores measuring 1.5cm in length a piece and collected using a 16-gauge 
biopsy needle under sterile conditions from each enrolled subject should be sent to ProKi dney using 
the refrigerated shipping container provided by ProKidney and according to procedures detai led in 
the Study Reference Manual. ProKidney will contact the site to confirm receipt of sufficient bi opsy 
material to manufacture REACT . If the biopsy cannot be used to manufacture REACT , the subject 
should be discontinued from the study. 
Subjects who do not experience complications from the biopsy may be discharged the sam e day 
consistent with site standard practice. Otherwise, the subject should remai n in the hospital overnight 
for observation. The subject may be discharged on the day after the biopsy so long as any biopsy-
related AEs have resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline. 
6.3. REACT  Injection 
Due to shipping and manufacturing schedules, R EACT  injection should be scheduled on a 
Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. If it is necessary to schedule the REACT  injection on a Tuesday, 
the site should contact ProKidney in advance to make certain that a Tuesday delivery can be 
accommodated. The REACT  injection should not be scheduled on a Monday. 
Subjects will report to the clinic 10 to 14 days before the scheduled REACT  injection for pre-
treatment assessments. If the su bject remains eligible, based on verification of inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, the site will perform a renal scintigraphy study and contac t ProKidney indicating 
that the REACT  product should be produced for that particular subject. 
It is anticipated that all subjects will receive two pl anned REACT  injections to allow dose-finding 
and to evaluate the duration of effects. As indicated on the time and events tables ( i.e., Table  1), the 
series of 2 REACT  injections will be administered 6 months apart with a study visit window of 4 
weeks. Regardless, every attempt should be made to ensure that the second REACT  injection 
is admi nistered 6 months after the first injection . In the event that the subject cannot schedule 
his/her second REACT  injection 6 months after receiving the first injection or  cannot keep his/her 
scheduled 6-month visit, ProKidney and the Medical Monitor must be notified immediately. The 
expectation is that the subject and the clinical center wil l accommodate the  Sponsor’s preference 
that the series of 2 REACT  injections should be administered no more than 6 months apart. 
In some cases, a subject or the Investigator may decide to postpone or withhold the  second REACT  
injection. For example, if there appears to be any untoward safety risk, or rapid det erioration of 
renal function, or the development of uncontrolled diabetes or uncontrolled hypertension, or t he 
development a malignancy or an intercurrent infection, then the second REACT  injection should 
not be administered. 
If continued eligibility cannot be verified for a particular subject, the site  should contact ProKidney 
who will alert the manufacturing staff not to prepare the REACT  product. The Investigator and 
ProKidney will discuss the reason(s) that the subject did not qualify and determine the  best course 
of action. For example, if the subject was excluded for a te mporary condition (e.g. , active infection) 
then it may be possible to manufacture REACT  at a later date, assuming future eligibility can be 
established. If the results of pre- treatment assessments indicate that it is highly unlikely  for that 
subject to becom e eligible for REACT  injection(s), then the subject should be discontinued from the 
study. If REACT  injection is delayed ( e.g., due to an intercurrent illness), the renal scintigraphy 
study, if conducted, does not need to be repeated prior to injection. 
Confidential  Page 54 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   Eligible subjects will arrive at the hospital or clinical research center on the  morning of REACT  
treatment. The subject will be injected with autologous REACT  using a percutaneous approach as 
discussed in Section  7.5.2.  
6.4. Discharge After REACT  Injection  
On the day after REACT  injection and prior to discharge, an ultrasound will be performed to detect 
possible, subclinical adverse effects (e.g., swelling, fluid accumulation). If pr oduct- or procedure - 
related AE’s occurred following REACT  injection, the subject should not be discharged until the 
AE’s have resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline. If consistent with the si te’s standard 
practice, the subject may be discharged the same day as the REACT  injection after no less than  2 
hours of observation and monitoring. 
6.5. Follow -up Visits  
The subject will return to the clinic for follow -up visits on Days 1 (if discharged day of REACT  
injection), 7, 14, and 28 (± 3 days) and Months 2, 3, 4 and 5 (± 7 days) after the first REACT  
injection , and on Days 1 (if discharged day of REACT  injection), 7, 14, and 28 (± 3 days) and 
Months 2 and 3 (± 7 days) after the second  REACT  injection (Table  1 and Table  2).The subject will 
also report to the clinical center 10 to 14 days before the planned, final REACT  injection to undergo 
pre-treatment assessments. Every attempt should be made to ensure that the second REACT  
injection is administered 6 months after the first injection.  
Following the final REACT  injection, subjects will complete long -term, follow -up assessments of 
safety and efficacy through Months 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 (± 7 days) post- treatment.  
6.6. End-of-Study Visit  
This section describes situations in which a subject will undergo the EOS visit; for  example, due to 
premature discontinuation from the study or completion of all protocol-specified foll ow-up visits. 
• If a subject discontinues from the study after undergoing the renal biopsy but before  
REA CT injection, then that subject should complete all EOS assessments except for t he 
MRI and/or renal scintigraphy studies. These imaging studies should only be completed 
if, in the judgment of the Investigator, one and/or the other would provide critical sa fety 
information needed for patient care. If the subject is experiencing an inves tigational 
product- or study procedure-related SAE, then the subject will not be discontinued until  
the SAE has resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline. 
• If a subject dis continues from the study after undergoing one or two REACT  injections 
but before completing all of the protocol- specified follow -up visits, then he/she should 
have the EOS Visit at the time of discontinuation. For these subjects, the Investi gator 
will dete rmine whether or not it is clinically prudent to perform one or both of the 
imaging studies ( i.e., MRI and renal scintigraphy). If the subject is experiencing an 
investigational product- or study procedure-related SAE, then the subject will not  be 
discontinued until the SAE has resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline. 
• If a subject completes all of the protocol- specified follow -up visits, he/she will undergo 
all EOS assessments 24 months after the final REACT  injection at the EOS Visit. If the 
subject is experiencing an investigational product- or study procedure- related SAE, then 
the subject will not be discontinued until the SAE has resolved, stabilized, or returne d to 
baseline.

   6.7. Study Completion  
Completion of the study is defined as the time w hen the last subject completes the EOS Visit, or 
when the last subject is considered lost to follow-up, withdraws consent, or dies.

   7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
7.1. Demography and Medical History  
Demographics characteristics will be obtained for each subje ct at the Screening Visit.  
All CKD -related medical history and all other significant medical history  will be recorded in the 
CRF beginning at the Screening Visit. Throughout the study, medical conditions that are stil l 
ongoing will be regularly updated in the CRF. 
7.2. Clinical Evaluations  
7.2.1.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs to be measured include systolic/diastolic blood pressure, hear t rate, respiration rate, and 
temperature. Blood pressure will be measured after the subject has res ted in a sitting position for a 
minimum of 5 minutes. At the Pre -Biopsy Visit (Day -3 to Day-1) and Pre- Injection Visit (Day -14 
to Day - 10 Visit), three BP measurements will be taken and the average of the 3 measurements (for 
systolic and diastolic pressure) used to satisfy entry criteria and entered i nto the CRF. 
7.2.2.  Physical Examination 
The Investigator or designee will perform the PE. The compreh ensive examination will assess all 
pertinent body systems while the interim examination will include specific assessments of those  
body systems deemed appropriate for that subject by the Investigator. As a general rule for the 
interim examination, the Investigator will review the subject’s AEs prior to, or in conjunction with, 
the examination and include assessment of related body sy stems as  appropriate. Only clinically 
significant abnormalities will be recorded in the CRF.  
The subject’s weight will be measured at every visit that i ncludes a complete or interim physical 
examination. The subject’s height will be taken at the Screening Visit. Body Mass  Index (BMI) will 
be calculated as kg/m2. 
7.2.3.  ECG  
A 12 -lead ECG will be obtained after the subject has been resting on their b ack for 5 minutes. 
7.2.4.  Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications will be recorded in the CRF as follows:  
• Screening V isit until first REACT  injection:  Record any CKD- specific medications 
as well as medications that may affect renal hemodynamics a nd/or serum creatinine 
measurements. In addition, record any medications used to treat an AE that is 
documented in the CRF. Surgical medications used during the biopsy procedure do not 
need to be captured in the CRF unless their use falls outside of expected dosages  and/or 
frequencies of administration. 
• First REACT  injection until 6 to 7 months of follow -up: Record any medication s 
taken until 6 to 7 months after treatment, depending on when the second REACT  
injection will be  administered. Surgical medications used during the REACT  injection 
procedure do not need to be captured in the CRF unless their use falls outside of 
expected dosages and/or frequencies of administration. 
Confidential  Page 57 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   • Second (Final) REACT  injection until 6 months of follow -up: Record any 
medications taken until 6 months after the last REACT  treatment. Surgical medications 
used during the REACT  injection procedure do not need to be captured in the CRF 
unless their use falls outside of expected dosages and/or frequencies of administ ration. 
• 6 months of follow- up through the EOS Visit:  Record CKD -specific medications, 
that may affect renal hemodynamics and medications that may affect serum creatinine 
measurements. Record medications used to treat any AE documented in the CRF. 
7.2.5.  Funduscopic Exam of Retina  
This exam should be completed at screening, month 12, and month 24/EOS to monitor for diabetic 
retinopathy of both eyes. Retinal photography should be collected and kept within the patient 
records and any worsening from baseline should be reported as an AE if not already docume nted in 
medical history.  
7.3. Laboratory Assessments  
Planned clinical laboratory evaluations are listed in  Table  12. Analyses will be conducted by a 
central laboratory, except as noted. The schedule for collecting biological sample s during the study 
are shown in  Table  2.

creatinine will be defined by ProKidney , and the samples will be analyzed  by the central laboratory. 
For comparison to each subject’s histori cal values, it may be necessary  to perform a second analysis 
at the site laboratory used to generate the historical data.  The need  for any additional assays 
conducted locally by the site laboratory will be defined at the Site Initiation Visit.  
7.3.2.  Urine Collec tion 
Urine will be collected and analyzed via standard panel and urine chemistry. The schedul es for 
collecting each type of urine sample are shown in  Table 2. 
Urine  will be  collected  over two different time  periods: 24- hour collection and “spot” urine. Spot 
urine collections will be used for dipstick urinalysis (test stick) assessments. The schedules for 
collecting each type of urine sample are shown in  Table  2. To provide a comprehensive picture of 
protein and albumin excretion, both total protein and albumin will be assessed in all sampl es. 
Confidential  Page 59 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
7.3.3.  Hematology 
Hemorrhage following biopsy and REACT  injection is a known and foreseeable risk to subjects 
participating in this study. Therefore, hemoglobin and hematocrit will be measure d by the site’s  
local laboratory before and after each procedure and compared to baseline l evels. Other bleeding 
parameters ( e.g., APTT, PTT -INR, platele ts) also will be measured throughout the study. 
7.3.4.  Virus Serology  
The biopsy cores obtained from each subject will be used for the expansion and sel ection of SRC. 
Contamination with HIV, HBV, and/or HCV would prevent ProKidney from manufacturing 
REACT  product for that subject. Therefore, each subject will undergo testing for viral  blood-borne 
pathogens, including HIV, HBV, and HCV. 
7.3.5.  Drug Screen  
Consistent with Exclusion Criterion #24 (See Section 5.2), subjects  are no t eligible  to participate  in 
the study if they have an “…active history of … drug abuse that, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, would impair the subject’s ability to comply with the protocol.” Therefor e, subjects 
will undergo testing for drugs of abuse. 
7.3.6.  Pregnancy Screen  
A qualitative urine pregnancy test will be performed at the site using a test- strip. If the test is 
positive, then a confirmatory test will be performed by the clinical laboratory. If site practices do 
not accept the results of a test -strip, then a urine sample should be sent to the central laboratory for 
analysis. Post-menopausal women with a confirmatory FSH test do not have to undergo pregnancy 
testing throughout the study. 
7.3.7.  Research Samples  
Research  samples  (serum/plasma and  urine) will be collected, frozen, and stored for the evaluation 
of novel biomarkers. Participating subjects can opt out of long-t erm storage  of their unused 
specimens  during the informed consent process  or at any time during the study ( Section 3.5.2.2 ).  
7.4. Renal Imaging  
7.4.1.  Ultrasound 
Renal ultrasound will be performed at the Screening Visit to  verify subject eligibility ( i.e., no 
evidence of renal tumors, polycys tic kidney disease, renal cysts or other anatomic abnormalitie s that 
would interfere with the REACT  injection procedure) along with obtaining a baseline echogenicity 
reading. Ultrasound will also be performed following the in-patient renal biopsy on D ay 0 and Day 
1 and following the in- patient REACT  injection(s) on Day 0 and Day 1 with the aim of monitoring 
possible, subclinical AEs. Findings from the ultrasound (e.g., resistance index, length, et c.) will be 
recorded on the CRF. An ultrasound may be conducted at other times, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, if needed for additional safety evaluation(s). 
7.4.2.  Computerized Tomography 
Computerized tomography (CT) must be used in conjunction with ultrasound during the REACT  
injection procedure, according to the u sual standards of care at the investigative site.  Use of 
fluoroscopic CT may be used in conjunction with ultrasound. 
Confidential  Page 60 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   7.4.3.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
An MRI study without contrast will be performed from the Screening Visit through D ay -1 before 
renal biopsy to determine kidney size and volume. During the site initiation visit, t he MRI process 
will be defined for each site, depending on the MRI equipment available. Genera lly, a 1.5-T unit 
should be used. MRI imaging studies will help determine kidney volume (for dosing calculati ons). 
MRI will be performed using standard sequences without injection of contrast agents . Renal volume 
measurements may be calculated, for example, using a fast 3D gra dient - echo sequence, VIBE, with 
an acquisition time of 22 seconds and sp atial resolution of  2 x 1.4 x 1.2 mm. Imaging parameters 
will be recorded in the source documents and CRF. A total of two MRIs will be performed on 
patients.  
7.4.4.  Renal Scintigraphy  
Renal scintigraphy will be used to assess left and right kidney function using the radioa ctive tracer 
99mTc- dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or Tc99m MAG3 (Mercaptoacetyl triglyci ne). This 
method is considered as the most reliable for measuring renal cortical functi on and is the preferred 
agent for this clinical trial. If the site standard practice  is to use a radiopharmaceutical other than 
99mTc-DMSA or Tc99m MAG3 then the site must discuss their procedure with ProKidney or t he 
Medical Monitor prior to site  initiation. If the site’s standard practice is considered suffi ciently 
equivalent to the procedure using 99mTc-DMSA or Tc99m MAG3, then the site will be allowed to 
follow their procedure. In this case, a copy of the site’s procedure wil l be signed/dated by the 
Project Leader from ProKidney and maintained in the site’s regulatory binder. All patients in this 
study will receive five renal scintigraphy studies. Renal scintigraphy will be performed befor e the 
first REACT  injection, before the last REACT  inject ion, at the 6- Month Visit after the last REACT  
injection, at the 12 -Month Visit after the last REACT  injection, and at the EOS Visit for all patients.  
7.5. Surgical Procedures  
7.5.1.  Biopsy 
Renal biopsy will be performed under sterile conditions using an ultrasound- o r CT-guided 
approach consistent with site practices. Two biopsy cores will be nee ded to provide sufficient 
material for the selection of SRC and manufacture of REACT . Likewise, a 16 -gauge needle should 
be used to insure adequate cortical material is obtain ed. If required, a 15-gauge needle may be used 
following consultation with the Medical Monitor and Manufacturing Facility. Bedside exam ination 
of the biopsy cores may be performed, if available, to ensure sufficient cortical material has been 
obtained. 
Since the biopsy tissue will be used to manufacture REACT , the site must ensure that the tissue 
cores are harvested using sterile conditions so that the risk of contamination during su bsequent cell 
expansion and selection is minimized. Contamination of the tissue cores could signifi cantly 
jeopardize the ability of ProKidney to manufacture REACT  product for that subject. 
Guidance on wound care and pain management following the biopsy procedure will be provided in 
the Interventional Radiologist Manual. Briefly, the subject will remain supine f or 4 hours with 
monitoring of hemoglobin, blood pressure, gross hematuria, abdominal/flank pain, and f lank 
ecchymosis. As long as any biopsy-related AEs have resolved, stabilized, or ret urned to baseline, 
the subject can be discharged from the hospital on the day after the biopsy consistent with site 
standard practice. Importantly, any pain medication administered after  the renal biopsy should be 
selected carefully, avoiding medications with nephrotoxic potential. 
Confidential  Page 61 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   If a subject experiences significant AEs following the biopsy that, in the opinion of the Investigator, 
would put the subject at increased risk for significant adverse effects follo wing REACT  injection, 
then he/she will not be treated with REACT  but will be followed until resolution of the event(s) and 
then discontinued from the study. 
7.5.2.  REACT  Injection  
Before performing the REACT  injection, the operating physician will evaluate the subject as 
follows: 
• Perform a physical examination to determine the feasibility of t he procedure.  
• Evaluate bleeding parameters, including coagulation panel, PTT- INR, platelets, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, and other pertinent laboratory studies. 
− Note: Hemorrhage following REACT  injection is a known and foreseeable risk to 
subjects participating in this study. Therefore, hemoglobin and hematocrit w ill be 
measured before and after each REACT  injection per the site’s standard practice 
and compared to baseline levels. 
• Review imaging  studies, including ultrasound, MRI, and CT or fluoroscopic CT, to 
determine route of  access, depth of kidney, and appearance of cortical -medullary 
junction. 
• Map potential REACT  cell deposition sites.  
• Determine classification and associated perioperative /post-operative risk according to 
the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) with respect to airway assessment, 
medical history, allergies, and medications. 
• Interview the subject and the subject’s family/supporters to discuss the p rocedu re, its 
risks and possible complications. Answer questions and obtain written informe d consent. 
Prophylactic antibiotics will be given intravenously according to site standar d practice. An initial 
CT scan may be ordered, if necessary, to evaluate adjacent vis cera, renal location, and the presence 
of renal cysts. A CT scan must be used in conjunction with ultrasound to locate the cortical -
medullary junction. 
REACT  is targeted for injection into the kidney cortex via a needle/cannula and syringe compati ble 
with cell delivery. The intent is to introduce REACT  via penetration of the kidney capsule and 
deposit REACT  into multiple sites of the kidney cortex. Initially, the kidney capsule will be pi erced 
using a 15- to 20- gauge trocar /access cannula inserted appro ximately 1 cm into the kidney cortex. 
In the Phase 1 clinical study, REACT  was administered via an 18 -gauge needle. The proposed 
Phase 2 study will utilize an 18- gauge or smaller needle for REACT  delivery. The needle will be 
threaded inside the access cann ula and advanced into the kidney, from which the REACT  will be 
administered. Injection of the REACT  will be at a rate of 1 to 2 m L/min. After each 1-to-2-minute  
injection, the inner needle will be retracted along the needle course within the  cortex to the second 
site of injection, and so forth, until the needle tip reaches the end of the access ca nnula or until the 
entire REACT  product has been injected. Using a percutaneous delivery approach, place ment of the 
access cannula /trocar and delivery needle will  be performed using direct, real- time imaging . A CT 
scan must be used in conjunction with ultrasound for the REACT  injection procedure . 
During the procedure, moderate conscious sedation will be employed; vital signs w ill be measured 
continuously. REACT  injection will cease if there is imaging evidence of cell extrava sation into 
Confidential  Page 62 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   central or peripheral renal blood vessels, the medullary portion of the kidney, or t hrough the renal 
cortex and into the retroperitoneal soft tissues, or evidence of active bleeding. 
Following completion of the REACT  injection, the inner needle will be withdrawn, and the outer 
cannula will remain in place for track embolization. During removal of the oute r cannula (trocar), 
the site of the renal cortex puncture and needle track throug h the retroperitoneum will be embolized 
with absorbable gelatin particle/pledgets (e.g. , Gelfoam® [Pfizer]) or fibrin sealant  (e.g. , TISSEEL 
[Baxter]) or other suitable agent to prevent excessive renal bleeding. 
Upon completion of the procedure, non- contra st CT scan or ultrasound with color Doppler 
evaluation will be performed to image puncture site cell injection and any he matoma or bleeding 
events. The subject will be monitored for 2 to 3 hours post- procedure in a recovery -room 
environment with nursing assessment and measurement of vital signs. Subjects who do not 
experience complications may be discharged the same day as REACT  injection, consistent with site 
standard practice.

8. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS AND MANAGEMENT
8.1. Adverse and Serious Adverse Eve nts 
8.1.1.  Definition of Adverse Events  
An A E is the developme nt of an undesirabl e medica l condition (including abnorma l laboratory 
findings ) or the deterioration of a pre-existing medica l condition following or during exposur e to a 
study treatment, whethe r or not considered to hav e a causa l relationship with study procedure s or 
the investigationa l product. A pre-existing condition i s a clinica l condition (including a condition 
being treated ) that is diagnosed befor e the subjec t signs the Informed Conse nt Form and i s 
documented a s part of the subject’ s medica l history. Pre-existing conditi ons that are stabl e or 
unchanged should not be considered A Es. 
The Investigat or is responsibl e for ensuring tha t all AEs observed by t he Investigat or or reported by 
the subjec t that occu r from the day of t he biopsy procedur e through 24 m onths  after the final 
injection of REACT  are monitored and recorded in t he subject ’s medical  record  as well as the CRF 
provided by t he Spons or or its designee. 
Treatment -emergent  adverse events  (TEAEs)  are defined  as any AE that started  after the first 
injection of REACT  or started  prior  to the first injection  but increased  in severity  or frequenc y after 
the first injection  of REACT . 
Unscheduled visit s may be performed a t any tim e during t he study a s judged necessary by the 
Investigat or to asses s and conduc t follow-up on AEs. Evaluati ons and procedure s to be performed 
at unscheduled visi ts will be  at the  Investigator’s  discretion  in consultation  with the Spons or and 
may be based on thos e listed in t he Schedul e of Events. 
The Investigator’ s clinica l judgme nt is used to determi ne whethe r a subjec t is to be removed from 
treatment  due to an AE. 
An AE is considered unexpected if it is not consistent in nature or severity with information 
contained in the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure provided by the Sponsor. 
8.1.1.1.  Definition  of Serious  Adverse Events  
An S AE is an AE that occur s during any phas e of the study ( i.e., ba seline, treatment, washout, or 
follow- up) at any dos e of the investigationa l product, comparator, or placebo, and fulfil s one or 
more of the following: 
•Results in death
•It is immediately life -threatening
•It requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
•It results in persistent or significant disability or i ncapacity
•Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect
•It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the su bject or may require medical
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
All SAEs that occur from the day of the biopsy procedure,  during treatment, or within 24 months 
following the final REACT  injection, whether or not they are related to study procedures or the 
Confidential  Page 64 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   investigational product, must be recorded in the subject’s medical record as wel l as the CRF 
provided by the Sponsor or its designee. 
8.1.1.2.  Other Significant Adverse Events  
Significant events of particular clinical importance inclu de SAEs and AEs leading to premature 
discontinuation of subjects from the study. These events will be recorded in the subjec ts’ medical 
records as well as the CRF provided by the Sponsor or its designee. Narratives of the se events may 
be prepared for inclusion in the Clinical Study Report. 
The following sections describe “adverse events of special interest” concer ning procedure- and 
product-related events. Subjects should be carefully monitored for the occurrence of  these potential 
AEs.  
8.1.1.3.  Procedure -Related Events  
Post-procedure pain :  If the subject experiences pain following the biopsy or REACT  injection, 
administration of paracetamol or paracetamol -codeine combinations is recommended. More severe 
pain in the loin or abdomen requires ultrasonography to exclude signif icant perirenal hemorrhage. If 
severe pain occurs, administration of opiates may be necessary. If analges ic doses higher than the 
maximum authorized doses are required to alleviate pain, then the Investigator mus t perform 
additional clinical evaluations to  ascertain the probable cause(s) of excessive pain.  
Hemorrhage: Following renal biopsy and REACT  injection procedures, subjects undergo regular 
hemoglobin and blood pressure monitoring. Subjects will be confined to bed and monitored for 
maintenance of norm al coagulation indices. If bleeding occurs and the subject is hypotensive 
despite bed rest, a blood transfusion may be considered. If the bleeding is still not c ontrolled, 
surgery may be considered. In rare cases, renal angiography may be performed to iden tify the 
source of bleeding. Coil embolization can be performed during the same procedure. 
Other complications:  In very rare cases, other organs (such as liver, gallbladder and lungs) may 
be penetrated during the biopsy procedure. In these cases, appropri ate treatment and follow - up may 
be discussed with consulting surgeons. 
Death: Deaths resulting from renal biopsies occur in <0.01% of patients .55,56,57  Adhere nce to strict 
inclusion /exclusion criteria will ensure that subjects who may be predisposed to unc ontrolled or 
excessive bleeding will not be enrolled in this trial.  
8.1.1.4.  Product -Related Events  
No REACT  product- related events are expected to occur. This assump tion is based on the 
autologous nature of REACT  (i.e., REACT  is manufactured from renal cells isolated from the same 
kidney to which they are being returned), the lack of product-related events observed in pre- clinical 
animal studies, and the lack of spec ific REACT - related events seen during and following implant 
of the first 5 subjects in the Phase 1 clinical trial. However, subjects will  be extensively monitored 
throughout the course of the study for any unexpected events. 
If an event occurs which is as sessed as related to the investigational product, REACT , then the 
event will be immediately reviewed by the Investigator and Medical Monitor. 
Confidential  Page 65 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   8.2. Adverse Event Intensity and Relationship Assessment  
8.2.1.  Intensity Scale  
Intensity will be assessed by the Investigator using the “Common Terminology Crit eria for Adverse 
Events” (CTCAE) version 4.03, from the US National Cancer Institute (refer to  
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf ). 
If the AE is not included in the CTCAE, then the Investigator will determine the intensit y of the AE 
according to the following criteria: 
• Mild (Grade 1) : The AE is noticeable to the subject but does not interfere with routine 
activity.  
• Moderate (Grade 2) :  The AE interferes with routine a ctivity but responds to 
symptomatic therapy or rest. 
• Severe (Grade 3) :  The AE significantly limits the subject’s ability to  perform routine 
activities despite symptomatic therapy. Severe events are usually incapacitating.  
• Life-Threatening (Grade 4) : The s ubject is at immediate risk of death.  
• Death (Grade 5)  
If the intensity (grade) changes within a day, the maximum intensity (grade) should be re corded. If 
the intensity (grade) changes over a longer period of time, the changes should be recor ded as 
separate events (having separate onset and stop dates fo r each grade).  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a mea sure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Definition of Serious Adverse  Even ts (See 
Section  8.1.1.1 ). Therefore, an AE of severe intensity may not necessaril y meet the criteria for 
seriousness.  
8.2.2.  Relationship Assessment  
An Inve stigator listed on Form FDA 1572 may make the determination of relationship to the study 
procedure or investigational product for each AE. The Investigator should judge whethe r there is a 
reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the study procedure or inve stigational 
product. If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be clas sified as 
“not related.” If there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause-
and-effect relationship, then the AE should be considered “possibly related” or “related” to the 
study procedure or investigational product. 
Definitions of relatedness categories are:  
• Not Related : Exposure to the study treatment did not occur, or the occurrence of the AE 
is not reasonably related in time, or the AE is considered unlikely to be related to the 
study treatment.  
• Unlikely Related :  The study treatment and the AE were not closely related in time, 
and/or the AE could be explained more consistently by causes other than exposure to the 
study treatment product. 
• Possibly Related :  The study treatment and the AE were reasonably related in time, and 
the AE could be explained equally well by causes other than exposure to the study 
treatment product. 
Confidential  Page 66 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   • Related :  The study treatment and the AE were reasonably related in time, and the AE 
was more likely explained by exposure to the study product than by other causes, or  the 
study treatment was the most likely cause of the AE.  
For the purpose of safety analyses, all AEs judged by the Investigator to be “possibly related” or 
“related” will be considered treatment -related adverse events.  
8.3. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by the subject and/or in response to an open ques tion from 
study personnel, or revealed by observation, or documented via laboratory reports, im aging reports, 
consult notes, survey instruments and other data collection tools, will be recorded in the s ubject’s 
medical records and CRF provided by the Sponsor or its designee. 
Adverse event s will be reported using standard medical terminology, whenever possible. A 
clinically significant change in laboratory values or vital signs need not be repor ted as an AE unless 
the abnormal change constitutes an SAE and/or leads to discontinuation o f treatment or withdrawal 
from the study. 
For each AE, the Investigator will record the start date, the stop date, the in tensity of each 
reportable event, the Investigator’s judgment of the relationship to the study p rocedure or 
investigational product, the action taken, severity (if applicable), and whether  the event resulted in 
discontinuation of treatment or withdrawal from the study. Follow-up information on any SAE  may 
be requested by ProKidney or its designee. 
All SAEs must be promptly reported by the Investigator to ProKidney or its designee within  24 
hours from the time when the Investigator first becomes aware of the event. All  SAEs must be 
reported whether or not they are considered causally related to the study procedure  or 
investigational product . SAE forms will be provided to each clinical site.  
The information collected will include subject number, a narrative descripti on of the event, and an 
assessment by the Investigator as to the intensity of the event and relatedness  to the investigational 
product. The Investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE pages, and verify the  accuracy of 
the information recorded against the corresponding source documents. Follow-up inform ation on 
the SAE may be requested by ProKidney or its designee. 
Contact information for reporting SAEs appears below: 
Email: CTISafety@ctifacts.com  
SAE Hotline: 1877-755-0742 
eFax : 1-800-541-1501 
 
ProKidney or its designee is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorit ies of certain 
AEs. It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notif y the IRB /EC of all SAEs that occur at 
the site.  
8.3.1.  Serious Unexpected Drug Reactions  
If there are ser ious, unexpected adverse drug reactions (SUSARs) associated with the use of the 
investigational product, ProKidney or its designee will notify the FDA and all participating  
Investigators on an expedited basis and in accordance with applicable regul ations. It is the 
responsibility of the Investigator to promptly notify the IRB /EC and other appro priate institutional 
regulatory bodies of all unexpected serious adverse drug reactions involving risk to human s ubjects. 
Confidential  Page 67 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   8.3.2.  Pregnancy  
Pregnancy is neither an AE nor an SAE, unless a complication relating to the pregnanc y occurs. All 
reports of congenital abnormalities /birth defects are SAEs. Spontaneous misca rriages should be 
reported and handled as SAEs. However, elective abortions without complications should not  be 
handled as AEs. 
All pregnancies experienced by female subjects enrolled in this study are to be reported in the same 
time frame as SAEs using the Pregnancy Form of the CRF. The course of all pregnanc ies, including 
perinatal and neonatal outcome, regardless of whether the subject has discontinue d participation in 
the study, will be followed until resolution, including follow-up of the health status of the new born 
to 6 weeks of age.  
The effects of administration of the investigational product on the pregnan t female or the 
developing fetus are unknown. Therefore, female subjects of child-bearing potentia l who are 
planning a pregnancy during the course of the study, or who are not using a highly effective 
method(s) of birth control, or who are unwilling to continue using a highly effective method of bi rth 
control throughout the duration of the study are not eligible to participate in the study. (Refer  to 
Exclusion Criterion # 23; Section  5.2). 
8.4. Data Safety Monitoring Board  
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be chartered to  oversee subject safety, especially as 
it relates to unexpected investigational product- related events. The DSMB will minimally co nsist of 
3 members who have expertise directly related to protocol -specified activities. It will function 
independently, and its members will have no other engagement with ProKidney . The DSMB will 
meet by teleconference at regular intervals, depending on t he speed of subject enrollment and the 
amount of new data generated. The DSMB will advise ProKidney on aspects concerning the sa fety 
of subjects participating in the clinical trial. Apart from reviewing study data, the DSMB will 
consider feedback from the Sponsor and Investigators. The DSMB will share its recom mendations 
with the study centers, Institutional Review Boards /Ethics Committees, and re gulatory authorities, 
as appropriate. Other specific activities and responsib ilities of the DSMB will be detail ed in the 
DSMB charter.  
8.5. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
The dates for the first 3 subjects who are scheduled to receive a second REACT  injection under 
IND 16482 will be staggered at a minimum of 3- week intervals. The DSMB will sequentially 
review the status of ea ch of these subjects prior to the next subject undergoing his/her second 
REACT  injection. After the third subject has received his/her second REACT  injection, the DSMB 
will meet to assess AEs and other safety parameters obtained to date for these 3 subjects described 
in the protocol. The DSMB may recommend changes concerning the second REACT  injection as 
well as protocol-specified study evaluations, and/or follow-up procedures. 
Apart from reviewing study data, the DSMB will evaluate relevant feedback from  the Sponsor and 
Investigators. 
8.6. Stopping Rules for an Individual Subject  
The Investigator, Medical Monitor, DSMB, and Sponsor may remove any subject from the st udy 
for: 
Confidential  Page 68 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   • Any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, intercurrent illness, other medical condition or 
situation whereby continued participation in the study would not be in the best inter est of 
the subject.  
• Development of any exclusion criterion. 
If a subject is terminated from the study, EOS assessments should be conducted at  the last visit. 
If any of th e following events occur, no additional subjects can receive REACT  injections until 
review by the DSMB has been completed: 
• An SAE that is rated as severe or life -threatening and, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, is related to REACT  or study procedures 
• Death of an enrolled subject 
• Similar SAE’s in more than one subject that are related to REACT , in the judgment of 
the Investigator 
• Inability to deliver a minimum of 50% of the dose of REACT  in more than one subject 
due to surgical or other issues 
8.7. Study Suspension or Study Termination  
As long as subjects are enrolled and participating in the study, including follow-up, the  Medical 
Monitor, DSMB, IRB /EC, Sponsor, FDA and other regulatory agencies will review ser ious, 
unexpected, procedure- and product- related AEs.  
Enrollment in the study will be suspended if any patient develops an apparent tumor, w hether in the 
kidney or at a remote anatomic site. A DSMB review will then determine whether or  not study 
amendment or termination is needed. The study will also be suspended in the event that tw o or more 
patients develop a similar unexpected SAE or AEs that are m ore severe than expected with the 
study drug or study procedures.  A DSMB review will then determine whether or not study 
amendment or termination is needed. If a decision is made to suspend or terminate the  study, the 
ProKidney will notify the Investigators /sites and ProKidney as well as the IRB /EC and regulatory 
authorities, as required. 
The DSMB, IRB /EC, Sponsor, Investigator(s), FDA and other regulatory authoritie s, as part of 
their duties to ensure human subject protection, may suspend the study at any time  due to concerns 
for the safety of study subjects. Once the clinical trial is ha lted ( i.e., no new enrollments and no 
further REACT  injections), a report will be submitted to the IRB /EC.  
Confidential  Page 69 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   9. STATISTICAL METHODS AND PLANNED ANALYSES  
9.1. Sample Size  
Up to 10 subjects who complete screening procedures and satisfy all inclusion a nd exclusion criteria 
will be enrolled.  
Statistical analyses will be primarily descriptive in natu re and no statistical hypothesis testing is 
planned for the study. Unless otherwise specified, continuous variables will be  summarized by 
presenting the number of non-missing observations (n), mean, standard deviation, media n, 
minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized by prese nting frequency count 
and percentage for each category. 
9.2. Criteria for Evaluation  
9.2.1.  Analysis Objectives and Endpoints  
9.2.1.1.  Primary  
To assess the safety of REACT  injected in one recipient kidney. 
• Primary Endpoint: Procedure and/or product related AEs through 24 months post-
injection.  
9.2.1.2.  Secondary  
To assess the safety and tolerability of REACT  administration by assessing renal- specific AEs over 
a 24-month period following injection. 
• Secondary Endpoints: Renal -specific laboratory assessments through 24 months post 
injection.  
9.2.1.3.  Exploratory 
To assess the impact of REACT  on renal function over a 24-month period following injection and 
on the Quality of Life. 
• Exploratory Endp oints: 1) Clinical diagnostic and laboratory assessments of renal 
structure and function (including eGFR, serum creatinine, and proteinuria) to asse ss 
changes in the rate of progression of renal disease, 2) patient -reported outcomes from the 
Kidney Disease  Quality of Life (KDQOL) and EQ-5D-5L surveys obtained at baseline 
(i.e., after randomization, but before REACT  injection) through 24 months after the last 
REACT  injection.  
9.3. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic data and baseline characteristics will be summa rized via sample size, mean,  standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for the continuous variables as well as the freque ncy 
and proportion for categorical variables. These summaries will be produced for both the full 
analysis set a nd the injection analysis set. Demographic and baseline characteristic infor mation will 
be presented as descriptive statistics; generating inferenti al statistics is not planned. These data will 
be provided in a tabular listing. 
Confidential  Page 70 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   9.4. Efficacy Analysis  
The primar y efficacy endpoint is serial measurements of eGFR obtained at 1, 3, 6, 12, 15, 18, 21, 
and 24 months after the last REACT  injection.  GFR will be estimated using the Chronic Kidney 
Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation that incorporates bo th serum creatinine 
and Cystatin C. [1] 
Estimated GFR measured at each time point will be summar ized by presenting descriptive statistics 
of raw data and change from baseline values for each tre atment group.  
9.5. Exploratory Analysis  
An exploratory analysis will be conducted to examine potential changes in health- related Quality of 
Life (HR -QoL).  
9.6. Statistical Methods  
Subjects will complete the KDQOL -SF™ survey ( i.e., Kidney Disease and Quality of Life Short 
Form). The KDQOL -SF is a 36 -item, validated,  HR-QoL instrument relevant to patients with 
kidney disease .64   This disease -specific, HR -QoL instrument consists of the following subscales : 
• The “SF -12 measure of physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) functioning” contains items 
about general health, activity limits, ability to accomplish desired tasks, depressi on and 
anxiety, energy level, and social activities.  
• The “Burden of Kidney Disease subscale” contains items about how kidney disease 
interferes with daily life, takes up t ime, causes frustration, or makes the respondent feel 
like a burden. 
• The “Symptoms and Problems subscale” contains items about how bothered a 
respondent feels by sore muscles, chest pain, cramps, itchy or dry skin, shortness of 
breath, faintness/dizziness,  lack of appetite, feeling washed out or drained, numbness in 
the hands or feet, nausea, or problems with dialysis access. 
• The “Effects of Kidney Disease on Daily Life subscale” co ntains items about how 
bothered the respondent feels by fluid limits, diet restrictions, ability to work around the  
house or travel, feeling dependent on doctors and other medical staff, stress or worri es, 
sex life, and personal appearance.  
9.7. Safety Analysis  
9.7.1.  Laboratory Evaluations 
Baseline values will be collected immediately prior to REACT  injection. Observed and change from 
baseline laboratory data will be summarized via sample size, mean, standard devi ation, median, 
minimum, and maximum for the continuous variables as well as frequency and proportion for t he 
categorical variables.  Laboratory abnormalities will be defined using the NCI CTCAE grading 
scheme. Abnormal laboratory values will be flagged as above or below the normal range . The 
results of laboratory testing for renal function, specifically sCr, BUN, and urinar y albumin, a re of 
particular interest for this study.  
The incidence of treatment- emergent laboratory abnormalities, defined as values that incr ease at 
least one toxicity grade between baseline and any time post -baseline up to six months following 
REACT  injection, will be summarized. If baseline data are missi ng, then the latest value between 
Confidential  Page 71 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   biopsy and injection will be used as the baseline value. If baseline and pre-injection data are  
missing, then any graded abnormality ( i.e., at least a Grade 1) will be considered as treatment - 
emergent. These values will b e summarized for both the full analysis set and the injection analysis 
set. Observed and change from baseline values will be presente d as descriptive statistics; generating 
inferential statistics is not planned. These data will be pr ovided in a tabular lis ting. 
9.7.2.  Adverse Events  
Clinical and laboratory AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regula tory Activities 
(MedDRA) version 18.1 by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT). Adver se events 
will be graded using the CTCAE version 4.03 from the US National Cancer Institute.  
A treatment -emergent AE will be defined as any AE that started after the first injection of REACT  
or started prior to the first injection but increased in severity or frequen cy after the first injection of 
REACT . Summarie s (frequency and proportion) of treatment-emergent AE’s will be pres ented by 
SOC and PT. Additional summaries will include, but are not limited  to, treatment - emergent AE 
judged to be related to the procedure and/or investigational product, intensity, re ason for subject 
withdrawal, SAEs, and deaths. The numbers of events (occurrence) and the number of  subjects 
(incidence) who experienced treatment -emergent AEs will be reported by treatment group. Adverse 
event data will be provided in a data listing. 
9.7.3.  Other Safety Evaluations 
Change from baseline for vital signs will be calculated for each subject a nd provided in a data 
listing. The number and percent of subjects who exhibit change(s) in their physica l examinations 
(such as from normal to abnormal) will be summarized via a data listing. The numb er and percent 
of subjects who develop abnormal heart rhythms or QT-interval prolongation during the  study will 
be provided in a data listing. Data from medical history, concomitant medications, ult rasound, renal 
scinti graphy, and MRI assessments will be provided in a data listing. 
Descriptive statistics for these evaluations will be gener ated as warranted.  
9.8. Biopsy and REACT  Injection(s)  
Biopsy and REACT  injection data will be provided in a data listing.

materials  (if applicable), and patient-reported questionnaires/surveys (if applicable), incl uding 
respective version dates, must be approved or given a favorable opinion in writing by an IRB /EC as  
appropriate. A copy of the written approval must be provided to the Sponsor. This documentat ion 
should clearly mention the approval/favorable opinion of the protocol, the subject Informed 
Consent Form, and subject recruitment materials (if applicable), and patient -reported 
questionnaires/surveys (if applicable) along with the respective version dates. The written approval 
and a list  of current  membership,  or Department  of Health  and Human  Services  (DHHS)  Assurance 
Number,  or letter  from the  IRB /EC stating  that the  membership  list is  on file, must be  provided  to 
the Sponsor prior to the release of clinical study supplies to the investigational sit e and 
commencement of  the study.  If any member  of the IRB /EC has direct participation  in this clinical 
trial, written notification regarding his or her abstinence from voting must also be obtained. 
The Investigator must inform the IRB /EC of any amendment to the protocol, provide updates about  
the ongoing trial at intervals (at least annually) specified by the respective IR B /EC, and submit 
final study reports to the IRB /EC. In addition, the IRB /IEC must approve all advertisi ng used to 
recruit subjects for the study along with any written information to be provided to subj ects (e.g., 
diaries,  calendars,  patient -reported surveys) and updates to the Informed Consent Form. 
It is the Investigator’s  responsibility  to notify  the IRB /EC of all SAEs  that occur  at his  or her site. 
The Sponsor is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain sa fety events, 
including unexpected, serious, drug- related  adverse reactions  that occur during the clinical study. 
The Investigator is responsible for notifying its IRB /EC of these unanticipated SAEs . 
Initial IRB approval, and all materials approved by the IRB for this study includi ng the subject 
consent form and recruitment materials must be maintained by the Investigator a nd made available 
for inspection. 
10.3.1.  Subject  Informed Consent  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing t o participate in the 
study and continuing throughout the individual’s study participation. The Investigator will ensure 
that potential participants  (and their families)  are given  full and  adequate  oral and  written  
Confidential  Page 73 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   information about the nature, purpose, possible risk(s) and benefit(s) of th e study. IRB-approved 
consent forms explaining study procedures and the investigational product /intervent ion(s) will be 
provided. The Investigator will explain the research study and answer any questions t hat may arise. 
Potential participants should have sufficient time to discuss the study, ask questi ons, and process the 
information during the consent process before deciding whether or not to participa te. 
The rights and welfare of potential subjects will be protected by emp hasizing that the quality of 
their medical care will not be adversely affected should they d ecide not to participate in the research 
study. Those individuals who agree to enroll must sign and date the current version of the Infor med 
Consent Form prior to starting any study-related procedures, including screening. Subje cts may 
withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the clinical trial without pena lty or prejudice 
toward future medical care.  
The acquisition of informed consent will be documented in the participant’s medi cal records, as 
required by 21 CFR 312.62. The Informed Consent Form will be signed and personally dated by th e 
participant and the person who conducted the informed consent discussion. A copy of the s igned 
Informed Consent Form must be given to the subject while the original, signed Infor med Con sent 
Form must be retained by the Investigator. 
10.4. Subject Confidentiality  
Individual subject medical information obtained as a result of this study is consider ed confidential 
and disclosure to third parties is prohibited. Such medical information may be  given only after 
approval of the subject to his/her physician or to other appropriate medical pe rsonnel responsible 
for the subject’s well -being. The Sponsor affirms the subject’s right to protection against invasion 
of privacy. Only a subject identification number and/or initials (where allow ed by local or national 
regulations) will identify subject data retrieved by the Sponsor. However, ProKi dney requires the 
Investigator to permit the Sponsor, its designated representative(s), the I RB /EC, and when 
necessar y, representatives of the regulatory health authorities to review and/or to copy a ny medical 
records relevant to the study. 
10.5. Substantial Amendment to the Protocol  
A substantial amendment to the protocol must be agreed upon in writing by the Sp onsor, then 
submitted to and approved by the respective regulatory authority before the amendm ent can be 
implemented. It is the responsibility of ProKidney or its designee to ensure compliance with the 
appropriate regulatory requirements.  
Written approval of a protocol amendment is not required prior to implementat ion of changes that 
eliminate an immediate hazard to the study subject; however, approval must be o btained as soon a s 
possible thereafter. Any protocol amendment also must be signed by the Invest igator, who will 
provide a copy to the IRB /EC. 
10.6. Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the protocol or GCP requirements. The 
noncompliance may be attributed to the subject, the Investigator, or the site st aff. All protocol 
deviations will be documented and reported by the monitor during the course of the study as 
described in the Study Monitoring Plan. ProKidney will work with the site to develop and 
implement any corrective actions to address protocol deviations, as appropriat e. 
Confidential  Page 74 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   Serious breaches of the protocol that are likely to significantly affect the safety of a subject or the 
integrity of the data generated must be reported to the Sponsor, IRB /EC, and r egulatory 
authorities. 
Although, in principle, no deviations from or changes to the protocol are permitted, under  
emergency circumstances protocol deviations may proceed without prior appr oval from ProKidney , 
IRB /EC and regulatory authorities to protect the rights, safety, and well-being of s tudy subjects.

   11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPING  
11.1. Data Collection and Review  
11.1.1.  Data Collection 
ProKidney or its designee will provide the clinical sites with access t o CRFs  for each subject. A 
CRF must be completed for every subject who provides written, informed consent and has 
undergone at least one protocol-specified, study- specific assessment. CRF completion instructions 
will be provided to the site in the Study Reference Manual. The Investigator or des ignated 
representative should complete the CRFs as soon as possible after the in formation has been 
collected. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, complet eness, and timeliness of 
the data reported in a subject’s CRF. Source documen tation supporting the CRF data should 
indicate the subject’s participation in the study and document the dates and detail s of study 
procedures, AEs, and subject status. 
When a subject completes the study, the Investigator must review and sign the CRF indic ating that 
he/she has reviewed the completed CRF and pertinent clinical data for that  subject and that, to the 
best of his/her knowledge, all data recorded in the CRF accurat ely reflect the subject’s clinical 
performance in the study. 
11.1.2.  Study Monitoring  
Befo re an investigational site can enter a subject into the study, a representative of  ProKidney or its 
designee will visit the investigational study site to:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities.  
• Discuss with the Investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilit ies under the 
protocol as well as the responsibilities of ProKidney. This will be documented in a 
Clinical Study Agreement between ProKidney and the Investigator. 
During the study, a study monitor appointed by ProKidney or its designee will ha ve regular contacts 
with the site and conduct on-site monitoring visits as described in the Study Monitoring Pla n. 
Monitoring and auditing procedures, approved by the Sponsor, will ensure that the study is 
conducted in accordance with the protocol and regulatory requirements while ensuring t he safety of 
all study subjects. Apart from on- site visits, the monitor will maintain frequent communication wit h 
the Investigator and site personnel via letters, e-mails, telephone, and FAX . 
Duties of the monitor includ e, but are not limited to:  
• on-site review of the CRFs for completeness and clarity  
• confirmation that the facilities remain acceptable  
• confirmation that investigational product accountability checks are being per formed 
• confirmation that AEs and SAEs are properly documented in the CRFs, and that any 
SAEs have been forwarded to ProKidney or its designee and the IRB /EC 
• recording and reporting of any protocol deviations not previously sent to ProKidney, the 
IRB /EC, and regulatory authorities, as required 
• clarification of administrative matters  
Confidential  Page 76 12 January 2021 ProKidney Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT) REGEN -003 v1.7 
 
 
   The monitor will perform source data verification, including a comparison of the da ta in the CRF 
with the subject’s medical records at the hospital or clinic, and other recor ds relevant to the study. 
Source data verificat ion requires direct access to all original records for each subject. The review  of 
medical records will be performed in a manner that ensures sub ject confidentiality.  
Regulatory authorities and the IRB /EC may request access to a ll source documents for on- site 
inspection or an audit. Likewise, the Sponsor or its designee may conduct a quality assuranc e to 
ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory req uirements. Direct access to source 
documents must be guaranteed by the Investigator, who will provide support at all  times for these 
activities.  
11.2. Audits and Inspections  
The purpose of an audit or inspection by the Sponsor, regulatory authorities, the IRB  /EC, or other 
appropriate institutional bodies is to systematically and indepen dently examine all  study- related 
activities and documents to determine whether these activities w ere conducted, and the data were 
recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported, in accordance with the protocol, ICH-GCP, and any 
applicable regulatory requireme nts. The Investigator and the site /institution must provide support at 
all times for on -site audits or inspections by providing direct access to all source documents, CR Fs, 
and other study documentation. The Investigator must notify ProKidney or its desig nee immediately 
if contacted by a regulatory agency about an inspection. 
Additionally, the Sponsor or its designee will be allowed to conduct site visits to the  investigational 
facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study. The Investiga tor agrees to allow the 
monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug accountability records, subjec t 
charts, study source documents, and other records relative to study conduct. 
11.3. Retention of Records  
The Investigator agrees to keep records and those documents that include (but are not  limited to): 
the identification of all participating subjects; medical rec ords; study -specific source documents; 
source worksheets; all original signed and dated Informed Consent Forms; records of  any body 
fluids or tissue samples retained; query responses; and, detailed records of inve stigational product 
accountability to enable evaluations or audits from regulatory authorities, the S ponsor, or its 
designees.  
These documents are to be retained until at least two years aft er the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketi ng applications 
in an ICH region, or at least two years have elapsed since the formal discontinua tion of clinical 
development of the investigational therapy. If the Investigator cannot meet thi s obligation, he/she 
must ask the Sponsor for permission to make alternative arrangements; details  of these 
arrangements should be documented. If the Investigator withdraws from the res ponsibility of 
retaining the study records, custody must be transferred to a person willing to acce pt the 
responsibility. ProKidney must be notified in writing if a custodial change occurs .

   12. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Independent qu ality assurance (QA) and clinical quality control (QC) syst ems are implemented and 
maintained using written standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure that the t rial is conducted, 
and data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the pr otocol, ICH-
GCP, and the applicable regulatory requirements. 
To ensure compliance with Good Clinical Practices and all applicable regulator y requirements, 
ProKidney may conduct a quality assurance audit. Refer to Audits and Inspections ( Sectio n 11.2 ) 
for more details regarding the audit process. 
13. PUBLICATION POLICY  
All information regarding the investigational therapy is the confidential property of  ProKidney . The 
Investigator agrees to use this information to conduct the study and will not use it for other purposes 
without written approval from the Sponsor. It is understood that there is an obligation to provide 
ProKidney with complete data obtained during the study. ProKidney retains full rights over a ny 
invention, discovery, or innovation, patentable or not, that may occur during the conduct of the 
clinical trial.  
It is anticipated that the results of this study will be presented at scientific meeting(s) and/or 
published in a peer-reviewed journal(s). A Publications Committee, composed of Investigators 
participating in the study and representatives from the Sponsor, will oversee the public ation and 
presentation of study results, which will reflect the experi ence of all participating clinical sites.  
The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors has adopted a trials- registration policy 
requiring that all clini cal trials be registered in a public database (such a s ClinicalTrials.gov and 
clinicaltrialsregister.eu) as a condition for publication i n member journals. It is the responsibility of 
ProKidney to register the present study in an acceptable clinical trial registry on or before the onset 
of subject enrollment.

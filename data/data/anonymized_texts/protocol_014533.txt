1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Study Overview  
1.1.1 Title  
REAFFIRM is a prospective randomized study to asses the safety and effectiveness 
of FIRM procedures followed by conventional ablation, including PVI (pulmonary 
vein isolation) versus a standard PVI ablation procedure for the treatment of 
symptomatic, persistent atrial fibrillation.  
1.1.2 Objectives  
The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of FIRM procedures for the treatment of symptomatic persistent (including long -standing persistent) 
atrial fibrillation (AF).  
The secondary objective is  to evaluate the treatment time and quality of life 
outcomes in subjects who undergo FIRM ablation.  
1.1.3 Patient Population 
REAFFIRM will include subjects experiencing at least two (2) documented episodes of symptomatic persistent atrial fibrillation (including  long standing persistent) 
during the three (3) months preceding study entry.  At least one episode should be documented by rhythm strip or ECG.  
1.1.4 Inclusion Criteria  
• Attempt of at least one Class I or III anti -arrhythmia drug with failure defined 
as recurrence of symptomatic atrial fibri8llation or adverse drug effect resulting in stopping the medication.  
• Left atrial size suitable for mapping with existing basket catheters, currently ≤60mm on the l argest diameter on CT scan or intracardiac echocardiography  
1.1.5 Exclusion Criteria  
• Class III or IV NYHA heart failure  
• LVEF <3 5% 
• Unrevascularized ischemia including symptomatic angina 
• History of rheumatic heart disease  
• History of intracardiac thrombus  
• History of procedures that may complicate placement of a basket catheter  
• Patients with a history of poor compliance  
• Patients unwilling or unable to provide consent

1.1.6 Study Masking  
REAFFIRM is an open -label, randomized study (no masking).  
1.1.7 Randomization 
REAFFIRM will be randomized 1 : 1, with half of the subjects allocated to the 
experimental group (FIRMap followed by conventional PVI ablation) and the other 
half to the control group (conventional PVI ablation only).  Randomization will be 
accomplished du ring screening and entry into the ClinCapture EDC system being 
used for this study. 
1.2 Study Outcomes  
1.2.1 Primary Outcomes  
1.2.1.1  Acute Safety  
Freedom from major adverse events related to the procedure within seven (7) days of the procedure.  
1.2.1.2  Long Term Safety  
Freedom from cumulative major adverse events related to the procedure (including any repeat procedures required) within one year of the index procedure.  
1.2.1.3  Acute Effectiveness  
• The acute success of FIRM ablation is defined as elimination of the source as indicated by:  
o Source no longer noted on immediate post- ablation FIRMap AND  
o Anatomic (region designated by FIRMap ablated on electroanatomic mapping system) or electrical (reduction of electrogram amplitude to 
<0.2mV in region designated by FIRMap identified region  
1.2.1.4  Long  Term Effectiveness  
• The long term success of FIRM ablation is defined as single procedure 
freedom from atrial fibrillation recurrence  
o Single procedure freedom from atrial fibrillation recurrence at 3 
months  
o Subjects not achieving acute success at the index procedure, as defined above, will be considered long term success failures

1.2.1.5  Secondary  Outcomes  
1.2.1.5.1  Quality of Life  
EQ5D scores pre -ablation will be compared to those post- ablation at all time points 
separately and together (ANOVA).  
1.2.1.5.2  Reduction in AF Burden  
In those subjects with CIEDs in place prior to the initial procedure, reduction in AF 
burden will be assessed using percent of AF in the 1 -2 months prior to the initial 
procedure compared with percent of AF in the 3 month follow -up period.  
1.2.1.5.3  Total Ablation Time  
Total ablation time as measured by total time of ablation lesion applications, from first ablation lesion to end of last lesion, will be documented.  These values will be 
compared between the FIRM -guided and conventional ablation groups.  If ablation 
for AT/atrial flutter is pursued, this ablation time will be documented separately.  
1.2.1.5.4  Total Radiation Exposure  
As above, these values will be compared between the FIRM -guided  and conventional 
ablation groups.  
1.2.1.5.5  Repeat Procedure and Hospitalization 
Any descriptive information regarding repeat procedures and re- hospitalizations 
will be compared between groups.  
1.2.1.5.6  Cardioversion for Early Recurrence of AF (ERAF)  
Specific requirement for electrical cardioversion for AF/AT recorded in the first 3 month blanking period.  
1.2.1.5.7  Long- Term Freedom from all Atrial Arrhythmias  
Freedom from recurrence of any atrial tachyarrhythmia (excluding typical CTI 
dependent atrial flutter) incuding AF at 3 months, and from 3 months after the 
initial AF ablation procedure.  
1.2.1.5.8  Cumulative Long- Term Freedom From AF 
Cumulative long -term freedom from AF will be assessed at 12 months after the 
initial AF procedure but will permit results of repeat ablation.  
1.2.1.5.9  Early Recurrence of AF/AT  
Recurrences of sustained AF/AT in the first 3 months.

1.2.1.5.10  Change in Atrial Function  
Change in left atrial size and pulmonary vein inflow Doppler on echocardiogram 
(when available).  
1.2.1.5.11  Change in Ventricular Function 
Change in left ventricular ejection fraction and parameters of diastolic dysfunction 
(when available).  
2 Statistical Methods  
2.1 General Analysis Principles  
All primary endpoint analyses will be conducted under the principle of “Intention-
To-Treat” (ITT), where each subject randomized to a treatment group who has had a 
mapping and/or ablation catheter inserted shall be considered part of the ITT group.  As a s econdary exploratory analysis, a “Per Protocol” (PP) analysis may be 
performed with a subgroup of the ITT group who have no major protocol deviations reported.  
2.2 Study  Endpoints  
2.2.1 Long -Term Effectiveness  (Primary effectiveness endpoint)  
The long -term effectiveness of FIRM ablation versus conventional ablation shall be 
defined as freedom from atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence  at 3 months.  Freedom 
from AF recurrence is defined as no documented episodes of AF > 30 seconds with 
conventional non- invasive monitoring or, in the case of a cardiac implanted 
electronic device (CIED), < 1% AF noted overall.  
The statistical hypothesis for this endpoint is operationalized as follows:  
HO: pE = p C 
HA: pE ≠ pC 
α =  
Where:  
pE = the proportion of “successes” in the FIRMap arm  
pC = the proportion of “successes” in the conventional ablation control arm  
The proportion of successes in each treatment arm shall be estimated using Kaplan-
Meier survival estimation.

2.2.2 Acute Effectiveness (Secondary effectiveness endpoint)  
The acute success of FIRM ablation is defined as elimination of the source as 
indicated by; 1) source no longer noted on immediate post- ablation FIRMap and; 2) 
anatomic (region designated by FIRMap ablated o n electroanatomic mapping 
system) or electrical (reduction of electrogram amplitude to <0.2mV in region designated by FIRMap) ablation of the FIRMap identified region.   
The proportion of successes in each arm will be calculated as follows:  
 
Where:  
n = the total count of “successful” subjects in the arm in question  
N = the total count of subjects for that arm in the ITT group  
The statistical hypothesis for this endpoint is operationalized as follows:  
HO: pE = p C 
HA: pE ≠ pC 
α =  
Where:  
pE = the proportion of “successes” in the FIRMap arm  
pC = the proportion of “successes” in the conventional ablation control arm  
The analysis to be performed for this endpoint will be a Chi- square test of 
Independence.  
2.2.3 Acute Safety  
The acute safety success of either treatment arm is defined as freedom from major adverse events related to the procedure within seven (7) days of the index 
procedure.  
The proportion of successes in each arm will be calculated as follows:  
 
Where:  
n = the total count of subjects presenting freedom from major adverse events 
related to the procedure within seven (7) days of the index procedure.  
N = the total count of subjects in that arm in the ITT group  
The statistical hypothesis for this endpoint is operationalized as follows:

HO: pE = p C 
HA: pE ≠ pC 
α =  
Where:  
pE = the proportion of “successes” in the FIRMap arm  
pC = the proportion of “successes” in the conventional ablation control arm  
The analysis to be performed for this  endpoint will be a Chi- square test of 
Independence.  
2.2.4 Long -Term Safety  
Long -term safety is defined as freedom from cumulative major adverse events 
related to the procedure (including from any repeat procedures required) within 
one year of the index procedure.  
The statistical hypothesis for this endpoint is operationalized as follows:  
HO: pE = p C 
HA: pE ≠ pC 
α =  
Where:  
pE = the proportion of subjects free from major adverse events related to the 
procedure (including from any repeat procedures required) within one year of the 
index procedure  in the FIRMap arm  
pC = the proportion of subjects free from major adverse events related to the 
procedure (including from any repeat procedures required) within one year of the 
index procedure in the conventional ablation control arm  
The proportion of successes in each treatment arm shall be estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival estimation.

2.4 Missing Data and Lost to Follow -Up (Censoring)  
No imputations or last observation carried forward (LOCF) will be conducted in this 
study.  For purposes of the long -term primary safety and effectiveness endpoints, 
subjects missing safety or effectiveness data or lost to follow -up will be censored at 
their latest visit prior to the missing safety or effectiveness data.  
For all other analyses, (acute safety and effectiveness), two presentations will be completed, one where the subject missing acute safety or effectiveness data or lost 
to follow -up will be excluded from the analysis, and another where that individual 
will be counted as a “failure” for the purpose of endpoint analysis.  Both results will be presented.  
2.5 Secondary Analyses  
All secondary analyses will be for informational purposes only, and primarily descriptive in nature, and no statistical tests of significance will be performed.  
2.6 Methods for Handling Multicenter Data 
For the long -term primary safety and effectiveness endpoints, a Cox Proportional 
Hazards model will be fit, using center as a covariate to identify any potential site 
interaction with long -term safety and effectiveness outcomes.  For acute safety and 
effectiveness  endpoints, a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel  (CMH) test statistic will be 
calculated to evaluate the interaction of center on acute outcome.  
2.7 Planned Interim Analyses  
No interim analyses are planned for this study.

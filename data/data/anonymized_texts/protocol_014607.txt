Statement of Purpose: State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested.   The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of a single intraoperative ketorolac injection on intra-operative narcotic use, postoperative pain and narcotic use, and hospital readmission rates in patients who undergo retrograde ureteroscopy for kidney and/or ureteral stone management.   2. Background: Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. Provide references to support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.  The incidence and prevalence of urolithiasis in the United States has risen considerably over the past few decades.(1) Treatment for ureteral stones can include expectant therapy for asymptomatic and small stones,, shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) or ureteroscopy (URS) with lithotripsy for obstructing or symptomatic stones up to 15-20mm, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy for larger more complex stones.  Historically, SWL offered a non-invasive and effective intervention for the treatment of most symptomatic stones and was the preferred therapy. However, with advancement in ureteroscopic digital optics, miniaturization of scope caliber, improved flexibility and durability, and recognized better stone free rates, utilization of URS has steadily grown and is overtaking SWL as the preferred treatment modality for kidney stones. URS is accepted as the treatment of choice for lower ureteral stones and is associated with stone free rates of up to 100% by post-operative day 2.(2)   One limitation of URS is that post-operative pain due to intra-operative instrumentation and the common utilization of temporary ureteral stents can be challenging to manage. The complication rate for URS requiring postoperative hospital admission has been reported at up to 14%, with pain being the predominant complication.(4)  This temporary post-operative pain and stent related colic is perhaps the greatest barrier, aside from surgeon skill, to the wider utilization of this URS over SWL, which has less efficacy but can be better tolerated.  In addition to improving URS as a technology, we as physicians must improve the tolerance of URS for the patients.   Ketorolac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) available in oral or parenteral formulations. It is a highly effective analgesic with comparable potency to narcotics, non-
Page 10 of 28  habit forming, and without the gastro-intestinal (e.g. nausea, ileus, constipation) or neurologic side effects seen with narcotics. Ketorolac use is generally safe for short durations limited to less than 5 days. Contraindications including NSAID allergy, renal insufficiency, NSAID induced asthma, peptic ulcer disease, bleeding diathesis, pregnancy/breast feeding, or advanced age. The peri-operative use of ketorolac had been limited due to bleeding concerns. However, surgical studies have shown that its use in appropriately selected patients does not result in increased clinically significant bleeding but does improve pain control over placebo with reduced narcotic use. (6)     It has been previously shown that in-patients who undergo ureteral stent placement following SWL, the use of ketorolac as an intravesical agent significantly decreased discomfort 1hour after treatment in comparison to patients who did not receive the treatment.(5) The safety of this was also confirmed as there were no postoperative side effects from the instillation.(5)   Currently,  there is currently no consensus on standard of care regarding intraoperative analgesia for ureteroscopy. A ureteral stent is utilized in about 90% of patient. Patients are discharged with a prescription for oral narcotics and stents are usually removed on post-operative day 5-7.   To the best of our knowledge there have not been any prospective studies that have evaluated the use of intraoperative ketorolac in patients who undergo URS, regardless of stent placement, to minimize postoperative pain.  We hypothesize that patients who receive intraoperative ketorolac during URS will have improved outcomes with regards to postoperative pain assessment as well as decreased pain related hospital admissions in comparison to patients with no treatment.   3. Research Plan: Summarize the study design and research procedures using non-technical language that can be readily understood by someone outside the discipline. Be sure to distinguish between standard of care vs. research procedures when applicable, and include any flowcharts of visits specifying their individual times and lengths. Describe the setting in which the research will take place.  This is an investigator-initiated, single-center, prospective randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of intraoperative Ketorolac on post-operative pain in patients undergoing ureteroscopy at Yale-New Haven Hospital.  The study population will include anyone between the age of 18-80 who is  undergoing elective ureteroscopy for management of stone disease without contraindication to ketorolac.  Patients who are being consented to undergo a ureteroscopy with Dr. Motamedinia will be asked to participate in this study. There is currently no consensus on standard of care regarding intraoperative analgesia for ureteroscopy. There is wide variability in practice, some clinicians choose to administer intraoperative analgesia while others rely only on the sedation effects of general anesthesia. This study is being carried out to see if administration of Ketorolac during ureteroscopy provides a post-operative benefit in pain scores when compared to no treatment.  
Page 11 of 28   The intervention group in this study will receive a one time dose of Ketorolac 30mg intravenously after undergoing general anesthesia. Because they will be under general anesthesia, they will not know if they received the medication. Following the procedure, the intervention group may continue to use Ketorolac as needed to manage pain. The only difference between the intervention group and the non-intervention group is the one time dose of intraoperative ketorolac.   The FDA approves Ketorolac as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), indicated for the short-term (up to 5 days in adults) management of moderately severe acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level.  Following assessment of eligibility and documentation of consent to participate in the study, patients will be randomized to receive intraoperative Ketorolac Tromethamine (Toradol®) or not. In the no-treatment group, participants will not receive a dose of intra-operative Ketorolac. Pain will be managed in the standard way with post-operative Ketorolac as needed. In the treatment group, participants will receive one dose of Ketorolac IV 30mg during the procedure. Randomization will occur by the attending anesthesiologist.   For this trial the investigators, surgical team, and patients will be blinded to the administration of the agent,  which is given as an IV Push of 30mg. For patients who are older than 65 years or weight less than 50kg the dose will be adjusted to 15mg to minimize the risk of bleeding. The anesthesiologist will not be blinded as he/she will deliver the agent and because the use of ketorolac may alter their usage of other intra-operative agents and post-operative agents. The surgical team will be un-blinded post-operatively.  Following the procedure, patients will rate their pain using a visual pain assessment scale at 1 hour postoperatively and at the time of discharge from the recovery room. Once the patient is at home, they will fill out a validated survey that has questions related to pain. This will be filled out once a day for a total of 7 days following the procedure. In addition, we will provide a medication utilization diary sheet for the patient to record daily use of prescribed narcotic and other as needed over the counter medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen.This will also be done daily for a total of 7 days. The patient will be surveyed at their one-week postoperative visit using the same assessment. All adverse drug reactions will be recorded from time of administration to initial follow-up.

How will eligibility be determined, and by whom?   Eligibility will be determined based on URS indications and inclusion and exclusion criteria. All patients will be determined eligible by Dr. Motamedinia  9. Risks: Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks, including risks to subject privacy, discomforts, or inconveniences associated with subjects participating in the research.   Additional risks from participating in this trial include those associated with the use of ketorolac. This includes but is not limited to bruising at place of injection, indigestion, allergic reactions including anaphylactic shock, abdominal pain, abnormal bleeding, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, gas, bloating, dizziness, drowsiness, sweating, nausea, ringing in the ears, & headaches.  
Page 14 of 28  The delivery of pain medications during ureteroscopy require the use of an intravenous (IV) line. This is a safe procedure used in every surgery requiring general anesthesia.  There is a slight chance that multiple needle-sticks will be needed to make sure the IV is placed correctly.  The subject might feel a small amount of pain when the IV is placed but it does not last very long.  A bruise or a minor infection might develop where the IV is placed.  A bruise will go away by itself and it might help if you wrap a warm towel around your arm.  Infections can also be treated if necessary.        10. Minimizing Risks: Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned risks will be minimized.  The above mentioned risks will be minimized as a thorough medication history for each patient will be assessed. Those who are previously known to have adverse events with NSAIDS or specifically ketorolac will be excluded. In addition, medication dosing will be in compliance with federal drug administration recommendation. For severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis, all patients will be under monitored anesthesia care during the procedure and immediately postoperatively and as such under the care of indivdiduals trained to recognize and treat this. Patients who are older than 65 may be more sensitive to the effects of ketorolac and clear the drug more slowly, so for this population we will dose reduce to 15mg. In addition, abdominal pain, nausea, vomit- ing, hyperventilation, peptic ulcers and/or erosive gastritis and renal dysfunction which have been associated with single dose ketorolac have resolved with medication discontinuation and for the purposes of this study, participants will only receive one dose and subsequently be discontinued on it.      A bruise from the IV will go away by itself and it might help to wrap a warm towel around the arm.  Infections can also be treated with antibiotics if necessary.        11. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan: Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) based on the investigator’s risk assessment stated below. (Note: the HIC will make the final determination of the risk to subjects.) For more information, see the Instructions, page 24. a.  What is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for subjects participating in this study? Greater than Minimal risk b. If children are involved, what is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for the children participating in this study? n/a c. Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan. Examples of DSMPs are   available here http://your.yale.edu/policies-procedures/forms/420-fr-01-data-and-safety-monitoring-plans-templates for i. Minimal risk ii. Greater than minimal   1. Personnel responsible for the safety review and its frequency:  
Page 15 of 28  The principal investigator will be responsible for monitoring the data, assuring protocol compliance, and conducting the safety reviews at the specified frequency, which must be conducted at a minimum of every 6 months (including when reapproval of the protocol is sought).  During the review process, the principal investigator will evaluate whether the study should continue unchanged, require modification/amendment, or close to enrollment. Either the principal investigator, or the IRB have the authority to stop or suspend the study or require modifications.  2. The risks associated with the current study are deemed greater than minimal for the following reasons: (choose those that apply)  1. We do not view the risks associated with the _use of Ketorolac as minimal risks.  Although we have assessed the proposed study as one of greater than minimal risk, the potential exists for anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it is not possible to predict with certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of first-hand experience with the proposed study methods. Therefore, we provide a plan for monitoring the data and safety of the proposed study as follows:  3. Attribution of Adverse Events: Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the study procedures / design by the principal investigator Piruz Motamedinia according to the following categories:  Possible: bruising at place of injection, indigestion, allergic reaction, abdominal pain, abnormal bleeding, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, gas, bloating, dizziness, drowsiness, sweating, nausea, ringing in the ears, & headachesmay be related to intraoperative Toradol use.  4. Plan for Grading Adverse Events:  The following scale will be used in grading the severity of adverse events noted during the study:  1. Mild adverse event- Abdominal pain (mild), headache, gas, bloating, indigestion, nausea 2. Moderate adverse event- Abdominal pain (mild), bruising at place of injection, sweating, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, ringing in the ears 3. Severe- allergic reaction leading to anaphylaxis, abnormal bleeding  5. Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events:  Serious Adverse Events: In addition to grading the adverse event, the PI will determine whether the adverse event meets the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).  An adverse event is considered serious if it results in any of the following outcomes:  1. Death; 
Page 16 of 28  2. A life-threatening experience in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  3. A persistent or significant disability or incapacity;  4. A congenital anomaly or birth defect; OR 5. Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.   An adverse event may be graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event.  Similarly, an adverse event may be graded as moderate but still meet the criteria for an SAE.    6. Plan for reporting UPIRSOs (including Adverse Events) to the IRB   The principal investigator will report the following types of events to the IRB:  Any incident, experience or outcome that meets ALL 3 of the following criteria: 1. Is unexpected (in terms of nature, specificity, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved protocol and informed consent document and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND  2. Is related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research); AND 3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, legal, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPIRSOs) may be medical or non-medical in nature, and include – but are not limited to – serious, unexpected, and related adverse events and unanticipated adverse device effects.  Please note that adverse events are reportable to the IRB as UPIRSOs only if they meet all 3 criteria listed above.  These UPIRSOs/SAEs will be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB Policy 710, using the appropriate forms found on the website. All related events involving risk but not meeting the prompt reporting requirements described in IRB Policy 710 should be reported to the IRB in summary form at the time of continuing review. If appropriate, such summary may be a simple brief statement that events have occurred at the expected frequency and level of severity as previously documented.  In lieu of a summary of external events, a current DSMB report can be submitted for research studies that are subject to oversight by a DSMB (or other monitoring entity that is monitoring the study on behalf of an industry sponsor).  7. Plan for reporting adverse events to co-investigators on the study, as appropriate the protocol’s research monitor(s), e.g., industrial sponsor, Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), Protocol Review Committee (PRC), DSMBs, study sponsors, funding and regulatory agencies, and regulatory and decision-making bodies. 
Page 17 of 28   For the current study, the following individuals, funding, and/or regulatory agencies will be notified (choose those that apply):  □x All Co-Investigators listed on the protocol. □ Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) □ National Institutes of Health □ Food and Drug Administration (Physician-Sponsored IND #_______) □ Medical Research Foundation (Grant______) □ Study Sponsor □x Other Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) or Committee (DSMC)  The principal investigator Piruz Motamedinia will conduct a review of all adverse events upon completion of every study subject. The principal investigator will evaluate the frequency and severity of the adverse events and determine if modifications to the protocol or consent form are required.    d. For multi-site studies for which the Yale PI serves as the lead investigator: This is a single site study i. How will adverse events and unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others be reported, reviewed and managed? ii. What provisions are in place for management of interim results? iii. What will the multi-site process be for protocol modifications?  12. Statistical Considerations: Describe the statistical analyses that support the study design.   All data will be collected prospectively. Preoperative data will include patient demographics, number of previous URS, baseline medications including analgesics, urine culture, stone size and location, and pain questionnaire scores. Mean scores will be calculated and compared between groups stratified by follow-up time. The number of adverse events and hospital admissions related to pain will recorded and described as counts and percentages.  The primary outcome that will be used to estimate effect size is mean post-operative pain.   Our study is set up as two independent groups with a continuous outcome (Pain measured on a 1-10 scale) and an enrollment ratio of 1. We anticipate mean post-operative pain in the non-intervention group to be 7 with a standard deviation of 2. We aim to detect a 10% difference in pain, in the intervention arm. With an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80% we will need to enroll 63 patients in each arm. 
Page 18 of 28    SECTION VI: RESEARCH INVOLVING DRUGS, BIOLOGICS, RADIOTRACERS, PLACEBOS AND DEVICES   If this section (or one of its parts, A or B) is not applicable, state N/A and delete the rest of the section.  A.  DRUGS, BIOLOGICS and RADIOTRACERS  1. Identification of Drug, Biologic or Radiotracer: What is (are) the name(s) of the drug(s)  biologic(s)  or radiotracer(s) being used? Identify whether FDA approval has been granted and for what indication(s).   Name of Drug: Ketorolac Tromethamine.  It has FDA approval as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), indicated for the short-term (up to 5 days in adults), management of moderately severe acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level.      2.  Background Information: Provide a description of previous human use, known risks, and data addressing dosage(s), interval(s), route(s) of administration, and any other factors that might influence risks. If this is the first time this drug is being administered to humans, include relevant data on animal models.    Ketorolac has been used for roughly the past 20 years as an alternative to opiates for parenteral pain management. Limiting the duration of use to 5 days or less has been shown to reduce the adverse effects associated with long-term use (8). The adverse effects of ketorolac are similar to other NSAIDs, including gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcers, renal failure in patients with chronic kidney disease, and bleeding due to platelet enzyme inhibition (9). To minimize the risk of bleeding, it is recommended not to administer ketorolac along with warfarin, heparin, or other NSAIDs (7).     The effects of analgesia with IV and IM administration of ketorolac is generally observed within 10 minutes, with peak pain control at 75-150 minutes. Current dosing recommendations for patients is 30 mg for a single dose, with totally daily dosages totaling less than 60 mg. Age related dosing for patients >65 years is generally accepted to be half of the dosage used for patients <65 years (7, 10).    Studies assessing the use of pre-operative IV administration of ketorolac demonstrated that 15-30 mg of ketorolac did not increase operative times or estimated blood loss, and also did not 
Page 19 of 28  significantly affect renal function. Ketorolac also decreased the use of morphine in the experimental group (11).   Other studies assessing the risk of bleeding in patients with concomitant use of ketorolac and anticoagulants failed to demonstrate any enhanced risk of operative site bleeding (8). There was a small risk of gastrointestinal bleeding noted in elderly patients who had used ketorolac more than 5 days with dosages exceeding 105 mg/day; however, use in patients younger than 65 years with dosages less than 105 mg/day, and usage for 5 days or less failed to show any increased risk of GI bleeding (12).    Bleeding risk with ketorolac has been established in spinal surgeries, where a single IV intra-operative dose of 30 mg failed to induce any significant changes in gross or surgical site bleeding (13).    3.  Source:  a) Identify the source of the drug or biologic to be used.         b) Is the drug provided free of charge to subjects?  Yes   No        If yes, by whom?  This drug is routinely covered as a cost by insurance as part of pain management for outpatient procedures.   4.  Storage, Preparation and Use: Describe the method of storage, preparation, stability information, and for parenteral products, method of sterilization and method of testing sterility and pyrogenicity. This drug is routinely utilized by Yale-New Haven hospital and is subjected to the same standards of storage and handling as other commonly utilized post-operative pain medication.

Page 22 of 28  All patients that are recruited into the study will be patients of the Principle Investigator (Piruz Motamedinia) and have a direct clinical relationship with him. Recruitment and data collection will be done through clinical visits.   6. Request for waiver of HIPAA authorization: (When requesting a waiver of HIPAA Authorization for either the entire study, or for recruitment purposes only.  Note: if you are collecting PHI as part of a phone or email screen, you must request a HIPAA waiver for recruitment purposes.)  Choose one:  ☐ For entire study  ☐ For recruitment purposes only  ☐ For inclusion of non-English speaking subject if short form is being used  i. Describe why it would be impracticable to obtain the subject’s authorization for use/disclosure of this data; ii. If requesting a waiver of signed authorization, describe why it would be impracticable to obtain the subject’s signed authorization for use/disclosure of this data;  By signing this protocol application, the investigator assures that the protected health information for which a Waiver of Authorization has been requested will not be reused or disclosed to any person or entity other than those listed in this application, except as required by law, for authorized oversight of this research study, or as specifically approved for use in another study by an IRB.  Researchers are reminded that unauthorized disclosures of PHI to individuals outside of the Yale HIPAA-Covered entity must be accounted for in the “accounting for disclosures log”, by subject name, purpose, date, recipients, and a description of information provided.  Logs are to be forwarded to the Deputy HIPAA Privacy Officer.  7. Required HIPAA Authorization: If the research involves the creation, use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI), separate subject authorization is required under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Indicate which of the following forms are being provided:     Compound Consent and Authorization form     HIPAA Research Authorization Form   8. Consent Personnel: List the names of all members of the research team who will be obtaining consent/assent.  Dr. Piruz Motamedinia will be obtaining consent/assent   9. Process of Consent/Assent: Describe the setting and conditions under which consent/assent will be obtained, including parental permission or surrogate permission and the steps taken to ensure subjects’ independent decision-making.   
Page 23 of 28  The PI routinely consults with patients regarding urinary stones. During the initial outpatient consultation with the PI, patients who are candidates for ureterscopic management and are in agreement to this surgical method will be recruited to participate in the study. These are all patients being seen in the outpatient clinic prior to surgery and are not under any acute distress/pain.  The investigator will explain the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise.  The participants will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study.  The participants will have sufficient opportunity to discuss the study and process the information in the consent process prior to agreeing to participate.  A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the participants for their records.  The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by emphasizing to them that the quality of their medical care will not be adversely affected if they decline to participate in this study. The acquisition of informed consent will be documented in the participant’s medical records.  The informed consent form will be signed and personally dated by the participant and the person who conducted the informed consent discussion. The original signed informed consent form will be retained in the medical chart and a copy will be provided to the participant    10. Evaluation of Subject(s) Capacity to Provide Informed Consent/Assent: Indicate how the personnel obtaining consent will assess the potential subject’s ability and capacity to consent to the research being proposed.   The PI performs a mental status exam as part of every physical exam during clinic visit. This exam assesses the subjects thought process, cognition, insight, and judgement. In addition to using this routine exam, the PI will assess the subject’s ability and capacity to consent by asking questions during the consent process to gauge whether they have an understanding of the study.  If the subject does not fully understand the study as it is described, he/she will not be enrolled.   11. Documentation of Consent/Assent: Consent form and pain assessment questionnaire will be used during the consent/assent process. Copies are attached   12. Non-English Speaking Subjects: Explain provisions in place to ensure comprehension for research involving non-English speaking subjects. If enrollment of these subjects is anticipated, translated copies of all consent materials must be submitted for approval prior to use.   We will not be recruiting non-English speaking patients in this trial.  12(a) As a limited alternative to the above requirement, will you use the short form* for consenting process if you unexpectedly encounter a non-English speaking individual interested in study participation and the translation of the long form is not possible prior to intended enrollment?  YES ☐  NO ☐  
Page 24 of 28  Note* If more than 2 study participants are enrolled using a short form translated into the same language, then the full consent form should be translated into that language for use the next time a subject speaking that language is to be enrolled.  Several translated short form templates are found on our website at:  http://www.yale.edu/hrpp/forms-templates/biomedical.html. If the translation of the short form is not available on our website, then the translated short form needs to be submitted to the IRB office for approval via amendment prior to enrolling the subject. Please review the guidance and presentation on use of the short form available on the HRPP website.  If using a short form without a translated HIPAA Research Authorization Form, please request a HIPAA waiver in the section above.    13. Consent Waiver: In certain circumstances, the HIC may grant a waiver of signed consent, or a full waiver of consent, depending on the study. If you will request either a waiver of consent, or a waiver of signed consent for this study, complete the appropriate section below.

Requesting a full waiver of consent for the Entire Study (Note: If PHI is collected, information here must match Section VII, question 6.)     If requesting a full waiver of consent, please address the following:     a. Does the research pose greater than minimal risk to subjects?    Yes  If you answered yes, stop. A waiver cannot be granted.    No    b. Will the waiver adversely affect subjects’ rights and welfare?  Yes   No    c. Why would the research be impracticable to conduct without the waiver?   d. Where appropriate, how will pertinent information be returned to, or shared with subjects at a later date?   SECTION VIII: PROTECTION OF RESEARCH SUBJECTS      Confidentiality & Security of Data: What protected health information (medical information along with the HIPAA identifiers) about subjects will be collected and used for the research?           Patient name, age and medical record number will be collected.  b. How will the research data be collected, recorded and stored?  
Page 26 of 28  Participants’ signed consent forms will be contained in a secure location separate from the questionnaires – within a locked file cabinet in the principle investigators office.  The questionnaires will not have any identifying information on them.  All data will be accessible only to the researcher(s) and the research advisor.   c.    How will the digital data be stored?  CD   DVD   Flash Drive   Portable Hard           Drive   Secured Server   Laptop Computer   Desktop Computer   Other  d.    What methods and procedures will be used to safeguard the confidentiality and security of     the identifiable study data and the storage media indicated above during and after the subject’s participation in the study?     The investigators will ensure that the subject’s anonymity is maintained.  Subjects will not be identified in any publicly released reports of this study.  All records will be kept confidential to the extent provided by federal, state and local law.   The study monitors may inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by the Investigator, including but not limited to, medical records.  The investigator will inform the subjects that the above-named representatives will review their study-related records without violating the confidentiality of the subjects. All laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports, and other records that leave the site will be identified only by a coded number in order to maintain subject confidentiality.  All records will be kept in a password protected computer.  Clinical information will not be released without written permission of the subject, except as necessary for monitoring by IRB.  Do all portable devices contain encryption software?  Yes    No          If no, see http://hipaa.yale.edu/guidance/policy.html   c. What will be done with the data when the research is completed? Are there plans to destroy     the identifiable data? If yes, describe how, by whom and when identifiers will be destroyed. If no, describe how the data and/or identifiers will be secured. Anonymized data will be kept through the course of the study and upon completion of manuscript after which it will be destroyed.   d. Who will have access to the protected health information (such as the research sponsor, the  investigator, the research staff, all research monitors, FDA, Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), SSC, etc.)? (please distinguish between PHI and de-identified data)   Only the specified research team will have access to the PHI.    g.   If appropriate, has a Certificate of Confidentiality been obtained? h.   Are any of the study procedures likely to yield information subject to mandatory reporting   requirements? (e.g. HIV testing – reporting of communicable diseases; parent interview -incidents of child abuse, elderly abuse, etc.). Please verify to whom such instances will need to be reported.  
Page 27 of 28   We do not anticipate that any of the study procedures will yield information subject to mandatory reporting requirements   SECTION IX: POTENTIAL BENEFITS   Potential Benefits: Identify any benefits that may be reasonably expected to result from the research, either to the subject(s) or to society at large. (Payment of subjects is not considered a benefit in this context of the risk benefit assessment.)   The treatment group may experience decreased postoperative pain and decreased risk of needing hospital readmission. The results of this study may be useful for guiding treatment strategies for other institutions involved in URS procedures.  In the event that no-benefit is noted (negative study) these findings would discourage the ineffective use of a medication which is cost saving and limit potential drug related side effects.            SECTION X: RESEARCH ALTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS  1.     Alternatives: What other alternatives are available to the study subjects outside of the research? Alternatives include no additional pain medication intraoperatively.  2. Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations): Describe any payments that will be made to subjects, the amount and schedule of payments, and the conditions for receiving this compensation.   There will be no payments made to subjects of this trial.  3. Costs for Participation (Economic Considerations): Clearly describe the subject’s costs associated with participation in the research, and the interventions or procedures of the study that will be provided at no cost to subjects.  Ketorolac is commonly used in the peri-operative setting. Costs of the drug are bundled into the billed amount for the specific procedure performed.    4. In Case of Injury: This section is required for any research involving more than minimal risk.  a.     Will medical treatment be available if research-related injury occurs? Yes medical treatment will be available for research-related injury, this will be coordinated by the PI.  b.     Where and from whom may treatment be obtained? The surgical team will routinely evaluate the patient during their operative stay and consult the appropriate specialty service should an injury occur.  c.     Are there any limits to the treatment being provided? No  d.     Who will pay for this treatment?  This will be under the same coverage of the patients insurance for the procedure.  e.     How will the medical treatment be accessed by subjects? Patients may present to Yale-New Haven Hospital for medical assistance that is required as part of this research project.

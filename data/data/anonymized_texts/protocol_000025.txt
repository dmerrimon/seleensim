V3	06/08/2016	Page	1	of	7	Title:	Decreasing	Postoperative	Pain	Following	Endometrial	Ablation:		A	Randomized	1	Controlled	Trial	2		3	Principal	Investigator:	Jordan	Klebanoff,	MD	4		5	Sub-Investigator:	Nima	Patel,	MD	6		7	Epidemiologist/Analyst:	Nancy	Sloan,	DrPH	8		9	Purpose:	To	determine	whether	paracervical	injection	of	long	acting	local	anesthesia	10	decreases	postoperative	pain	following	endometrial	ablation	under	general	anesthesia.	11		12	Background:			13	Destruction	of	the	endometrial	lining	to	control	bothersome	uterine	bleeding	14	has	been	implemented	since	1937	(ACOG	Committee	on	Practice	Bulletins,	2007).		15	Currently	there	are	various	different	‘second	generation’	energy	sources	to	avert	such	16	bleeding,	five	of	which	are	now	approved	in	the	United	States	(ACOG	Committee	on	17	Practice	Bulletins,	2007).		These	5	second	generation	devices	include:		18	Thermachoice/Cavaterm,	which	use	high	temperature	fluid	within	a	balloon;	Microsulis,	19	which	applies	microwaves;	Novasure,	which	uses	bipolar	energy;	Hydrothermablator,	20	which	uses	free	fluid	at	high	temperatures;	ELITT,	which	uses	laser	thermotherapy;	and	21	HerOption,	which	uses	cryoablation.			Patient	selection	for	endometrial	ablation	is	22	crucial,	as	it	is	intended	for	premenopausal	women	with	normal	uterine	cavities	and	no	23	desire	for	future	fertility	that	are	affected	by	heavy	menstrual	bleeding.		Since	the	24	introduction	of	the	initial	‘second	generation’	device	in	1997	these	modalities	have	25	overtaken	the	industry	mostly	due	to	their	ease	of	use	and	shorter	operative	times.		26	Regardless,	a	Cochrane	review	finds	insufficient	evidence	to	prove	superiority	of	these	27	newer	modalities	over	the	traditional	‘gold	standard’	resectoscopic	technique	(Anne	28	Lethaby,	2013).	29		30	Endometrial	ablation	has	been	demonstrated	in	a	variety	of	settings	including	31	outpatient	surgical	centers	as	well	as	physician’s	offices.		Evidence	suggests	that	32	microwave	endometrial	ablation	under	local	anesthesia	is	a	safe	and	acceptable	practice	33	(Wallage	S,	2003).		Very	often,	when	endometrial	ablation	is	performed	as	an	outpatient	34	procedure,	patients	are	pre-medicated	and	then	receive	a	paracervical	injection	of	local	35	anesthesia	to	control	pain	intraoperatively	(Mark	H.	Glasser,	2009).		When	endometrial	36	ablations	are	performed	as	an	outpatient	procedure	through	a	surgical	center,	a	variety	37	of	anesthesia	techniques	are	employed	depending	on	the	infrastructure	and	human	and	38	institutional	resources	available.		These	techniques	may	vary	from	conscious	sedation	to	39	general	anesthesia,	all	of	which	have	been	proven	to	be	acceptable	methods.	40		41	In	this	center	endometrial	ablations	are	performed	as	an	outpatient	procedure	42	under	general	anesthesia	with	a	variety	of	induction	techniques	and	intraoperative	pain	43	management	practices.		According	to	physician	preference,	patients	may	receive	an	44	
V3	06/08/2016	Page	2	of	7	additional	paracervical	injection	of	local	anesthetic	before	the	procedure,	immediately	45	after,	or	not	at	all.		To	date,	there	are	no	studies	evaluating	the	efficacy	of	local	46	anesthetic	in	addition	to	general	anesthesia	for	patients	receiving	endometrial	ablation	47	to	guide	physician	practice.	The	purpose	of	this	study	is	to	evaluate	the	efficacy	of	local	48	anesthetic,	in	addition	to	general	anesthesia,	in	our	large,	community-based	patient	49	population,	in	meaningfully	decreasing	postoperative	pain.	50		51		52	Methods:		53	This	study	will	be	a	single	center	prospective	single	blind	randomized	controlled	54	trial	of	premenopausal	women	undergoing	endometrial	ablation.			This	study	will	take	55	place	in	the	Christiana	Hospital	outpatient	surgical	center.		Patients	will	include	English	56	speaking	premenopausal	women	aged	30	–	55	scheduled	to	undergo	outpatient	57	endometrial	ablation	in	the	surgical	center.		These	patients	will	be	recruited	either	in	58	physician’s	offices,	by	telephone	based	on	surgical	scheduling,	or	on	the	day	of	their	59	procedure.		All	consents	will	be	signed	in	person.			60		61				Study	Design:	62	Frequently,	providers	will	give	their	patients	additional	analgesia	in	the	form	of	a	63	local	anesthetic	injected	as	a	paracervical	block,	either	before	or	after	the	completion	of	64	the	procedure	with	the	hope	of	reducing	postoperative	pain.		This	practice	is	not	65	standardized,	as	its	efficacy	has	never	been	evaluated	in	the	setting	of	endometrial	66	ablation	under	general	anesthesia.			67		68	The	purpose	of	this	study	is	to	assess	the	efficacy	of	this	additional	local	69	anesthesia	upon	completion	of	endometrial	ablation	under	general	anesthesia.		70	Patients,	once	consented,	will	be	randomized	in	blocks	of	6	to	either	the	treatment	71	group	or	control	groups.		Those	randomized	to	the	treatment	group	will	receive	a	72	paracervical	injection	of	20	mL	0.25%	Bupivacaine	at	the	completion	of	the	procedure	73	(Howard	W.	Jones	III,	2008).		Patients	randomized	to	the	control	group	will	receive	an	74	equal	volume	injection	of	normal	saline	with	the	same	paracervical	technique.		75	Paracervical	injection	will	be	standardized	to	include	a	total	dose	of	20	mL	divided	into	76	four	5	mL	injections	at	the	2,	4,	8,	and	10	o’clock	positions	on	the	cervix	(Howard	W.	77	Jones	III,	2008).		Paracervical	block	will	be	given	at	the	completion	of	the	endometrial	78	ablation.	79		80	Only	the	patients	and	PACU	staff	will	be	blinded	to	the	injected	solution.		Once	81	general	anesthesia	has	been	induced	the	circulating	nurse	will	open	the	study	patient’s	82	unique	randomization	sequence	and	the	appropriate	study	solution	will	be	drawn	in	the	83	operating	room.		The	endometrial	ablation	procedure	will	be	performed	by	the	surgeon	84	in	accordance	with	that	surgeon’s	specific	preference	for	technique	and	device.		Upon	85	completion	of	the	procedure,	and	before	general	anesthesia	is	reversed,	the	86	paracervical	injection	of	the	patient’s	unique	study	solution	will	be	administered	as	87	described	above.		The	operating	room	team	including	the	surgeon,	anesthesiologist,	and	88	
V3	06/08/2016	Page	3	of	7	ancillary	staff	will	be	aware	of	the	injected	solution’s	contents.		The	post	anesthesia	care	89	unit	(PACU)	staff	responsible	for	assessing	immediate	and	delayed	postoperative	pain	90	will	not	be	aware	of	the	contents	of	the	injected	solution,	except	when	necessary	for	91	any	unexpected	complication,	in	which	case	the	pharmacist	maintaining	the	92	randomization	coding	will	break	the	code	for	that	particular	patient.		All	patients	will	93	receive	IV	Toradol	with	completion	of	the	procedure	and	have	a	standardized	rescue	94	analgesia	protocol	in	place	in	the	postoperative	care	unit	setting	in	accordance	with	the	95	current	practice	described	above.		Per	the	nursing	protocols	postoperative	pain	will	be	96	assessed	using	10	point	Visual	Analog	Scale	(VAS)	and	if	patient’s	pain	is	above	or	equal	97	to	a	5,	on	the	10	point	scale,	they	may	receive	additional	analgesia	in	the	form	of	98	intravenous	(IV)	medication	or	by	mouth	tablets	(PO).		Pain	scores,	as	well	as	rescue	99	analgesic	administered,	is	routinely	recorded	by	the	nursing	staff	and	converted	to	a	100	patient’s	electronic	health	record.			101		102	Due	to	the	infrastructure	set	up,	at	CCHS	outpatient	endometrial	ablations	are	103	performed	under	general	anesthesia	with	the	patients	asleep	for	the	entire	procedure.		104	Per	the	standard	surgical	center	protocol	postoperative	patients	will	be	assessed	105	regularly	for	postoperative	pain.		If	the	patients	express	pain	equal	to	or	beyond	a	106	predetermined	threshold	of	5,	on	a	visual	analog	pain	scale	from	0	through	10,	they	may	107	receive	rescue	analgesia.		Patients	are	taken	directly	from	the	operating	room	to	the	108	PACU	where	their	pain	is	assessed	on	arrival	by	trained	nursing	staff.		Patients	are	kept	109	in	Phase	1	of	recovery	for	a	minimum	of	30	minutes,	and	a	minimum	of	30	minutes	in	110	Phase	2	before	discharge	following	general	anesthesia.		At	a	minimum	a	postoperative	111	patient’s	pain	is	assessed	every	10	minutes	in	Phase	1,	and	every	15	minutes	in	Phase	2.		112	Patients	are	candidates	for	rescue	analgesic	medications,	generally	in	the	form	of	113	Dilaudid	or	Fentanyl,	if	their	pain	score	is	greater	than	5	out	of	10.		In	Phase	1	pain	114	medication	is	generally	given	in	IV	form	whereas	in	Phase	2	pain	medication	is	usually	115	given	PO.	116		117	Figure	1:	Visual	Analog	Scale	118	
	119		120	Upon	discharge	all	patients	will	be	given	two	additional	10	point	VAS	forms	and	121	will	be	instructed	to	complete	these	two	pain	assessments	at	4	hours	and	8	hours	after	122	

V3	06/08/2016	Page	4	of	7	their	surgery.		These	pain	scales	will	be	labeled	before	discharge	with	the	patient's	study	123	identification	code,	date,	the	times	they	are	to	be	completed,	and	instructions	to	retain	124	the	forms	until	they	have	spoken	with	the	study	staff	on	the	following	day.		Each	patient	125	will	be	discharged	with	an	additional	prescription	for	twelve	tablets	of	Tylenol	#3.		Each	126	patient	will	then	be	contacted	on	the	day	following	their	surgery	by	a	study	investigator	127	to	record	the	patient’s	home	pain	scores	as	recalled	by	the	patient	by	use	of	the	two	128	pain	scales	completed	at	4	hours	and	8	hours	postop.		Each	patient	will	also	be	asked	to	129	disclose	how	many	of	the	twelve	Tylenol	#3	tablets	they	have	remaining.			130		131	Primary	Outcome:		132	We	propose	to	test	a	40%	decrease	in	the	mean	10	point	VAS	postoperative	pain	score	133	at	1	hour	after	the	operation.		This	percent	decrease	is	based	on	a	separate	IRB	134	approved	retrospective	chart	review	of	the	most	recent	patients	who	underwent	an	135	endometrial	ablation	at	the	Christiana	Hospital	surgical	center.	This	retrospective	chart	136	review	found	that	of	the	last	twenty	patients	who	underwent	an	endometrial	ablation,	137	without	any	additional	local	anesthesia	in	the	form	of	a	paracervical	block,	the	mean	138	postoperative	pain	score	at	1	hour	was	2.85±	2.21.		The	40%	hypothesized	reduction	in	139	pain	is	equivalent	to	approximately	1	full	point	on	the	VAS	scale	and	felt	to	be	a	clinically	140	meaningful	decrease	at	the	lower	end	of	the	VAS	scale	that	could	influence	policy	and	141	practice.	The	average	standard	deviation	between	the	mean	1	hour	postoperative	pain	142	scores	between	the	reviewed	charts	of	the	20	patients	receiving	a	paracervical	block	143	and	the	20	that	do	not	was	1.78,	approximately	equal	to	75%	of	the	average	mean	pain	144	scores	for	the	40	patients	who	did	and	did	not	receive	a	paracervical	block.		Using	a	two	145	tailed	test,	a	Type	I	error	of	5%	and	statistical	power	of	80%,	and	an	average	standard	146	deviation	equal	to	75%	of	the	average	VAS	scores	in	both	groups,	the	study	requires	a	147	sample	of	36	patients	per	study	group.		Assuming	a	15%	attrition	rate	this	study	requires	148	42	patients	per	study	arm	(84	total	participants).		Enrollment	in	this	study	will	occur	for	149	10	months,	or	until	the	number	of	participants	needed	per	study	group	is	met,	150	whichever	occurs	first.				This	allows	at	least	2	months	for	data	analysis	and	report	151	composition.		Enrollment	will	be	monitored	by	the	Principal	Investigator	(Klebanoff)	152	monthly,	to	gauge	when	enrollment	should	stop.		To	ensure	ongoing	enrollment	of	153	similar	numbers	of	participants	in	each	study	group,	randomization	in	blocks	of	2	will	be	154	used,	so	that	for	each	2	patients	enrolled,	1	will	be	assigned	to	each	study	group.	155		156	Secondary	outcomes:	The	study	will	also	conduct	descriptive	analyses	of	the	study	157	group	differences	in	postoperative	pain	scores	at	4	and	8	hours	following	surgery,	158	amount	of	rescue	analgesia	required	postoperatively,	but	before	discharge,	time	to	159	discharge,	postoperative	nausea/vomiting	requiring	medication,	blood	loss,	and	amount	160	of	narcotic	remaining	at	postoperative	day	one.		161		162	Data	Points:	163	Covariates	164	-	age	165	-	race/ethnicity	166

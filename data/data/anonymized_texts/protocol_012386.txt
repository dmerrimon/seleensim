Statistical Analysis Plan  
Data Analyses  
The objectives of statistical analysis in this pilot study were  to present data on (1) 
recruiting (e.g., the ratio of randomized participants to screenees, variab ility across 
time, etc.), (2) descriptive statistics on baseline characteristics, (3) rates of retention, 
adherence, dropout, and data completion, (4) rates of success by treatment group, (5) acceptability of the program to patients, (6) rates of adverse o utcomes (deaths, MI, 
HF, other important events), and (7) costs of various aspects of the study (recruitment, determination of eligibility, retention, treatment, and evaluation of outcomes). Statistical methods were primarily descriptive, although logistic  
regression was used to quantify effects of intervention on success at 8 weeks and 6 
months after the treatment period ends, controlling for stratum, baseline demographic 
variables and medi cal history. Analyses follow ed intention- to-treat principles. 
Statistical analyses was  carried out by staff in the Biostatistics , Epidemiology and 
Research Design unit in the CTSI under the direction of Dr. Connett.

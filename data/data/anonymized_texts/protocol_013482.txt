Page 5 Summary of Visit Schedule:  5 visits over the cours
e of approximately 14 weeks 
•Visit 1 = Screening ( Day -14 ± 2 )
•Visit 2 = Baseline  & Randomization, Day 1
•Visit 3 = 2-Week Follow- Up (Day 15 ± 2)
•Visit 4 = 1.5 Month Follow-up (Day 43 ± 2)
•Visit 5 = 3 Month Follow -up (Day 85 ± 2)
Measures Taken to Reduce 
Bias:  This is a randomized treatment assignment, double-masked study 
Study Population Characteristics:  
Number of Subjects:  Stage 1 :  
The total number of randomized patients for Stage 1 of the study will be approximately 100 at up to 2 sites.  Approximately 50% of patients should have a baseline eye dryness score of ≥ 60 and 
approximately 50% of patients should have a baseline inferior corneal staining score (ICCS) > 1.5 
according to the Ora Calibra
® staining scale.   Based 
upon data from Xiidra®, OPUS 2 a screen failure rate of ~ 50% is expected.   Thus, ~200 patients wi ll 
need to be screened to achieve ~100 patients randomized to treatment.   
Stage 2 :  
The total number of randomized patients for Stage 2 of the study will be approximately 330 ( see Figure  
6.1-1, Stage 2)  at up to 7 sites .  Approximate
 ly 50% 
of patients sh ould have a baseline eye dryness score 
of ≥ 60 and approximately 50% of patients should 
have a baseline inferior corneal staining score 
(ICCS)  > 1.5.   Based upon data from Xiidra®, 
OPUS 2 a screen failure rate of ~ 50% is expected.   
Thus, ~660 patients will need to be screened to 
achieve ~330 patients randomized to treatment.   
Note: patients can
 be reallocated from discontinued 
groups to increase the power in groups that are continued at the discretion of the DRC.

General Statistical Methods and Types of Analyses  
The safety population will include all randomized subjects who have received  at least 
one dose of the investigational product. The safety population will be analyzed for all 
safety assessments. Subjects in the Safety population will be analyzed as treated.   The 
modified intent- to-treat (mITT) population will be comprised of all ra ndomized 
subjects that have baseline and at least 1 post -baseline assessment for 1 or more of the 
efficacy measurements.  All patients in the mITT population will be analyzed by the treatment as randomized with last observation carried forward (LOCF) for m issing 
data.  This population will be used for the primary and the secondary efficacy analyses. 
The modified intent- to-treat 2 (mITT2) population will be comprised of patients who 
are included in the mITT and have baseline inferior corneal staining score ( Ora 
Calibra
® scale ) in the study eye > 1.5.  The mITT2 population will be analyzed as 
randomized.    In general, continuous data will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number of 
subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) and will be analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) techniques, two- sample t -tests, or Wilcoxon rank sum tests for between-group 
comparisons, and paired t- tests or sign -rank tests for within -group analyses.  
Categorical variables will be summarized by number of subjects (n), frequency counts, and percentages, and they wil l be analyzed using Pearson’s chi -square test or Fisher’s 
exact test (if the expected cell count is less than 5 in 25% or more of the cells).  Ordinal 
variables will be analyzed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) or the Wilcoxon 
rank- sum test for betw een-treatment comparisons and the sign -rank test for within -
treatment comparisons.

 The primary efficacy variables are:  
• Change from Baseline to Month 3 in inferior corneal staining score ( Ora 
Calibra® scale ) in the study eye 
• Change from Baseline to Month 3 in total corneal staining score (Oxford 
and Ora Calibra® scale s) in the study eye 
• Change from Baseline to Month 3 in eye dryness measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS)  
And 
• Change from Baseline to Month 3 in Total Ocular Surface Disease Index 
(OSDI) score.   
A patient will be considered a responder if a cure is reached for TFBUT (i.e., ≥ 10 sec), 
a Schirmer’s test (i,e., ≥ 10 mm), Total OSDI (< 18), or Ocular Discomfort Score 
(Score = 0) at a post -randomization visit.  The visit for the primary  variable is month 3 
and the primary analysis population is mITT with last observation carried forward 
(LOCF).  Statistical tests will be performed for each AXR -159 Ophthalmic Solution 
group versus vehicle group.  Pairwise comparisons of the proportion of responders will be performed using the CMH method stratifying by baseline eye dryness score and baseline inferior corneal staining score.  There will be no alpha adjustment for the multiple tests for the pairwise comparisons or multiple endpoints.   
An int erim analysis will be performed when the last enrolled patient in Stage 1 
completes Month 3 of the Expansion Cohort.  There is no plan to stop the study for efficacy on the basis of the interim analysis.  However, termination of individual dose 
groups due to safety, tolerability and/or futility may occur .  Statistical significance will 
not be declared at the time of the interim analysis.   
A final database lock will occur at the completion of Stage 2 and the safety, tolerability, and efficacy data from both Stage 1 and 2 will be analyzed separately and in a combined fashion to fully leverage the advantage of this two-stage study design.  At the final analysis, statistical significance will be declared for two-sided p -values < 
0.05.   
Safety: Safety measures will be analyzed using the safety population.  Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) nomenclature will be used to code 
adverse events.  Incidence rates of each treatment -emergent adverse event will be 
summarized by primary system organ class and preferred term.  Summary tables will be generated for all treatment -emergent adverse events regardless of causality as well 
as for those considered to be treatment -related.

Page 13 Sample Size Calculation:    The sample si ze is determined empirically.  Xiidra 
achieved a 0.25 unit difference between lifitegrast ophthalmic solution and vehicle in 
mean change from baseline to day 84 in inferior cornel staining and a standard deviation of approximately 0.75 in Phase 2. Sample sizes for this study are based o n 
detecting a 0.35 unit difference between the active and vehicle groups, assuming a standard deviation of 0.75.  In Stage 1 the number of expected enrolled subjects varies between 43 and 53 subjects in the active group and between 37 and 47 subjects in th e 
vehicle group.  In Stage 2 the number of expected enrolled subjects is 60 in the active group and 30 to 60 subjects in the vehicle group. Thus, the combined sample provides between 103 and 113 subjects in the active group and between 67 and 77 subjects in the matching vehicle group or between 97 and 107 subjects in the combined vehicle group.  Under these assumptions and allowing a dropout rate of 10%, sample sizes of 93 in the active treatment group and 60 in the vehicle group will yield 80% power to show a significant difference at the α = 0.05 level using a two -sample t -test. 
Summary of Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects  
AXR-159X has previously been well tolerated clinically when administered via oral inhalation or intranasal routes to healthy volunteers, asthma and allergic rhinitis patients. This is the first time that a competitive antagonist of the α4 subunit, α4β1 and α4β7 integrins, (AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution) is being administered as an eye drop in humans. The eye drop formulation was very well tolerated in preclinical species (i.e., rabbits, dogs) when administered at 50 mg/mL up to 12 times per day for up to 3 months.  Eye drop administration can be expected to produce negligible systemic levels of drug.  
Most reported adverse events from AXR-159 were considered mild to moderate in 
intensity and there have been no serious adverse events associated with the 
administration of AXR-159. Findings from pre-clinical studies support the 
administration of AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution (3 mg/mL, 30 mg/mL or 50 mg/mL) BID or TID in patients with DED.  While it is hoped that topical ocular dosing with AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution will im part some degree of relief from dry eye signs or 
symptoms including redness, itching, foreign body sensation or blurred vision while on study, this is a first in patient study and these benefits cannot be predicted from preclinical models of DED with certa inty.

Page 19 3 INTRODUCTION  
Dry eye  disease (DED) i s a multifactorial disease of  the ocular surface characterized b y a  
loss of homeostasis of the tear film, and accompanied by ocular symptoms, in which tear 
film instability and hyperosmolarit y, ocular surface infla mmation and damage, and 
neuronal sensory a bnormalities p lay e tiological roles (Craig et al , 2017).  DEWS II 
hypothesizes that d ry ey e disease (DED) is ”…initiated by de siccating  stress and  
perpetuated by a Vicious  Circle of  ocular su rface inf lammation (Bron et al, 2017).”  
Thus, no  matter w hat init iates a patient’s dry eye disease (e.g., allergic eye disease, 
topical preservative  toxicity,  or xerophthalm ia) all pa tients e ventually e nter a c hain of  
inflammat
ory eve nts that pe rpetuat e the disease.   
Experimentally, the expression of IL-1, TNF-α, and IL- 6 by o cular su rface epith elia are 
critical to the ocular surface dry ey e inflammatory r esponse.  A ke y step in the 
amplific
ation pr ocess f or inflammation  is the g enerat ion of signals th at recruit 
inf
lammatory cells to the site of inflammation: 1) chemokines and 2) integrin adhesion 
molecules.  Chemokines produced at the ocular surface (e.g., CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, 
CXCL 9, C
XCL10, and CX3CL1) can bind ma crophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and 
activated T cells.  The other  key step in hom ing inflamm atory cells to t he oc ular su rface 
is the expression of endothelial integrin adhesi on molecules (e.g., ICAM- 1, VCAM -1).  
ICAM -1 and VCAM -1 ar e adhesion molecules that bind to inf lammatory cells express ing 
the ligand, integrated leukocyte functi on antigen 1 (LFA-1; integrin αLβ2) and ver y late 
antige n 4 (VLA -4; integrin α4β1) , respectively.  Integrins facilitate cell-cell and  cell-
extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion and include the β1, β2, β4, immunoglobuli n, and 
selectin super families.  Known targets for treating ocular inflammation include αLβ2 and 
α4β1 (Br on et al, 2017). 
Lifitegrast ophthalmic solution (Xiidra®) 5% was approve d by the US FD A for the 
tre
atment of DED in 2016.  Lifitegrast is an anta gonist of LFA-1 ( also known as 
CD11a/CD18 or αLβ2).  Lifitegras t demonstrated  a statistically significant treatment 
response in the objective endpoint, change from baseline to Day 84 in inferior corneal 
staining  score in t he Phase 2 and O PUS 1 st udies and  a sta tically significant treatment 
response in the subjective endpoint , change from basel ine to Day 84 in eye dryness scor e 
(VAS) in the OPUS 2 and 3 studies (Semba & Gadek, 2016).  
Natalizumab, an antibody directed against the α4- integrin subunit, has been shown to 
profoundly inhibit inflammation and improve clinical outcomes in both multiple sclerosis 
and Crohn’s disease.  Topical, ocular application of BIO-8809 (Anti-V LA-4  small 
molecule) decreased corneal fluorescein staining, conjunctival T-cell infiltrates, and 
TNFα expression in cornea and conjunctiva in a murine dry eye model (Ecoiffier et al, 
2008).
AXR-159 (GW559090) is potent and selective antagonist for the α4 subunit, α4β1 and 
α4β7 integrins, 
which has been formulated as an eye drop and has been shown to be safe 
and well tolerated in the
 eye with no target organ toxicity identified at doses up to 30 
mg/kg/day in animal models. It lacks significant systemic exposure following topical 
ocular administration due to low systemic exposure and its high clearance rate from the 
circulation.

Page 20 In preclinical murine models of DED, AXR -159A impro ved corneal staining with similar 
efficacy and onset of action, as the topical steroid dexamethasone. Topical stero ids are an 
unapproved, but effective treatment for DED and often serve as positive controls in 
preclinical models of DED.  Topical ophthalmic corticosteroids are commonly used for the treatment of dry eye disease (DED) ( Holla nd et al, 2007; DEWS, 2007; Avunduk et 
al, 2003; Pflugfelder et al, 1999; Pflugfelder et al, 2004; Yang et al, 2006) .  Topical 
AXR-159A also significantly reduced corneal uptake of Oregon Green Dextran (OGD) compared to vehicle- treated disease controls, mu rine model of dry eye, in a dose-
dependent manner (1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/mL) with 30 mg/mL showing the greatest reduction in OGD staining. When administered topically, corneal expression of IL-1α, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)–9, chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9), and TGF- β1 were 
reduced in AXR -159A - treated eyes. Topical treatment with AXR -159A decreased 
dendritic cell activation in lymph nodes. The effects on corneal staining and cellular composition in draining cervical lymph nodes (CLN) were not reproduced by s ystemic 
administration of AXR-159A, suggestive of a local role for integrin antagonism in the treatment of dry eye ( Krauss et al, 2015).  
The presence of CD4+ T cells at the ocular surface in DED and the successful treatment 
of ocular surface inflammation with cyclosporine (i.e., Restasis® and Ikervis®) suggest 
that adaptive immunity is important in the pathophysiology of DED.  Initiation of an adaptive immune response requires that antigens at the site of inflammation are presented 
by professional antigen presenting cells that migrate to regional lymphoid tissue to 
activate and expand antigen -specific T cells.  The ability of AXR -159A to decreased 
dendritic cell activation in lymph nodes suggests it has the ability to block adaptive 
immunity associated with DED.    
Given the above clinical experience in man with an antibody directed against the α4- 
integrin subunit and preclinical work with novel α4 integrin antagonists, i.e., AXR-159A 
and BIO-8809, in pre-clinical models of DE D, AxeroVision Inc. believes that AXR -159 
has potential as a novel agent for the treatment of dry eye disease.

 5 CLINICAL HYPOTHESES  
Stage 1:   
 
AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution (50 mg/mL or 30 mg/mL) has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile following TID or BID administration for the study treatment duration.  
 
AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution (50 mg/mL or 30 mg/mL) demonstrates an Early Signal 
of Efficacy (ESOE) for either a  sign (e.g., Inferior Corneal Staining) or Symptom (e.g., 
eye dryness measured by VAS or Total OSDI) of DED.   
Stage 2:   
 At least 1 concentration of AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution (3 mg/mL, 30 mg/mL or 50 mg/mL) has an acceptable safety and tolerability pro file following TID or BID 
administration for the study treatment duration.  
 
At least 1 concentration of AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution (3 mg/mL, 30 mg/mL or 50 
mg/mL) is more effective than vehicle for treating DED as measured by either a sign 
(e.g., Inferior Corneal Staining) or Symptom (e.g., eye dryness measured by VAS or 
Total OSDI) of DED.  
6 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN 
 Overall Design 
This is a multicenter, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, randomized, parallel group study carried out in 2 stages (Stage 1:  AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution (30 mg/mL or 50 
mg/mL) dosed three- times daily (TID) or twice -daily (BID); Stage 2: AXR -159 
Ophthalmic Solution (3 mg/mL, 30 mg/mL or 50 mg/mL) dosed three- times daily (TID) 
or twice -daily (BID).  
For both Stages 1 and 2, patients with signs and symptoms of DED will be randomly 
assigned in a 1:1 (Stage 1) or up to a 2:2:2:2:1:1:1 (Stage 2) ratio to receive either a single concentration of AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution or AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution 
Vehicle.  A screening visit will be followed by a baseline period where subjects will dose 
with AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution Vehicle for 14 days. At the end of the baseline period patients who still exhibit signs and symptoms of DED will be enrolled into a  
3-mont h treatment period (See Appendix 1 for study visit structure across Stages 1 and  
2 and Figure 6.1-1 for the study flow diagram).  If only a single dosing regimen is 
selected for Stage 2 a 1:1:1:1 regime may be selected: AXR -159 Ophthalmic Solutions 
and AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution Vehicle. 
When the 10th patient enrolled in Stage 1, Cohort 1 (8 patients on AXR-159 Ophthalmic 
Solution 50 mg/mL TID and 2 patients on vehicle TID) completes the Week 2 visit, a 
Data Review Committee (DRC) will evaluate all available safety data.  If AXR -159 
Ophthalmic Solution 50 mg/mL TID is safe and well tolerated the DRC will recommend

 expansion of the AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution 50 mg/mL and vehicle TID groups  
(N = 4 5 per group) and to halt the initiation of Stage 1, Cohorts 2 and 3.  If AXR-159 
Ophthalmic Solution 50 mg/mL TID is NOT safe and well tolerated the DRC will recommend Stage 1, Cohort 2 (8 patients on AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution 30 mg/mL TID and 2 patients on vehicle TID) and to halt the Cohort 1 Expansion Cohort.  Patients 
already enrolled in Stage 1, Cohort 1 will continue at the investigator ’s discretion.  Any 
patients that discontinue during the study will be followed through the resolution of their 
adverse event (s) or end of study.  When the 10th patient enrolled in Stage 1, Cohort 2 
completes the Week 2 visit, a DRC will evaluate all available safety data.  If AXR -159 
Ophthalmic Solution 30 mg/mL TID is safe and well tolerated the DRC will recommend expansion of the AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution 30 mg/mL and vehicle TID Expansion 
Cohort (N = 40 per group) and to halt Cohort 3.  If AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution 30 mg/mL TID is NOT safe and well tolerated the DRC will recommend Stage 1, Cohort 3 (8 patients o n AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution 30 mg/mL BID and 2 patients on vehicle 
BID) and to halt the Cohort 2 Expansion Cohort.  Patients already enrolled in Stage 1, 
Cohort 2 will continue at the investigator’s discretion.  When the 10th patient enrolled in Stage 1, Cohort 3 completes the Week 2 visit, a DRC will evaluate all available safety 
data.  If AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution 30 mg/mL BID is safe and well tolerated the 
DRC will recommend expansion of the AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution 30 mg/mL and vehicle BID Expansion Cohort (N = 35 per group).  If AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution 30 
mg/mL BID is NOT safe and well tolerated the DRC will recommend stopping the study.  Thus, in stage 1 a successive cohort will only be started if the previous cohort is felt to be either unsafe or poorly tolerated by the DRC.    
When the last patient enrolled in Stage 1 completes the Month 3 visit in the Expansion 
Cohort, a formal Interim Analysis will be completed and the DRC will evaluate all available safety and efficacy data from Stage 1 before recommending initiation of Stage 
2.  Stage 2 is a parallel group design and the DRC may recommend up to a maximum of 7 groups as depicted in Figure 6.1-1 .  Groups that are either unsafe, poorly tolerated, or 
likely futile may be discontinued by the DRC.  The DRC may reallocate patients to the 
surviving AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution dose groups. 
A final database lock will occur at the completion of Stage 2 and  the safety, tolerability, 
and efficacy data from both Stage 1 and 2 will be analyzed separately and in a combined 
fashion to fully leverage the advantage of this two- stage study design.

 FIGURE 6.1-1  STUDY DESIGN  
 
 Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
Prior studies in dry eye have been marked by poor reproducibility. This is due partly to 
the heterogeneity of the population, inadequate assessment methods, and poor correlation 
between signs and symptoms.  
Xiidra (lifitegrast ophthalmic solution) which was a pproved by the US FDA on July 11th, 
2016 addressed these challenges through a variety of design considerations which are 
incorporated into t he current study design: 
1. The registration studies used a vehicle which was not palliative 
2. Subjects showing active si gns and symptoms of DED after a 2 week run-in on 
the vehicle either switched to lifitegrast ophthalmic solution 5% or stayed on vehicle 
3. The studies were enriched for both inferior corneal staining and/or eye dryness 
Thus, clinical study AXR201701 incorporates the learnings from the recently successful 
clinical program for Xiidra.

 Data Review Committee (DRC) 
A DRC consisting of physicians and trained study personnel, in addition to ad hoc 
internal/external experts, will assess study treatment effect s.  The composition and 
activities of the committee are described in the DRC charter.  The DRC will review 
available data to determine the appropriateness of continuing dosing and enrollment in 
Stage 1.  Based on review of data from all executed Stage 1 cohorts, the DRC will 
recommend whether to proceed to Stage 2 and the dose levels to be employed.  The DRC 
may recommend at any time during Stage 1 to de- escalate, delay, or to stop patient 
recruitment.  The number of treatment groups, doses, and number of subjects per-group 
in Stage 2 will be based on recommendations by the DRC following review of available 
Stage 1 data.  Details of the planned analyses will be provided in the DRC analysis plan.  
The DRC may also request ad -hoc review of masked or unmasked data at any time 
throughout the course of the study to evaluate new findings or recommend changes to study progression. 
 End of Study Definition  
A participant is considered to have completed the study if he or she has completed all phases of the study includ ing the last visit or the last scheduled procedure shown in the 
Schedule of Activities (SoA), Appendix 1. 
7 STUDY POPULATION  
 Number of Subjects (approximate) 
Stage 1:   
The total number of randomized patients for Stage 1 of the study will be approximately 
100 at up to 2 sites.  Approximately 50% of patients should have a baseline eye dryness 
score of ≥ 60 and approximately 50% of patients should have a baseline inferior corneal 
staining score (ICCS)  > 1.5 according to the Ora Calibra® staining scale.   Based upon 
data from Xiidra®, OPUS 2 a screen failure rate of ~ 50% is expected.   Thus, ~200 
patients will need to be screened to achieve ~100 patients randomized to treatment.   
Stage 2:   
The total number of randomized patients for Stage 2 of the study will be approximately 
330 (see Figure 6.1-1, Stage 2) at up to 7 sites.  Approximately 50% of patients should 
have a baseline eye dryness score of ≥ 60 and approximately 50% of patients should have 
a baseline inferior corneal staining score (ICCS) > 1.5 according to the Ora Calibra® 
staining scale.   Based upon data from Xiidra®, OPUS 2 a screen failure rate of ~ 50% is expected.   Thus, ~660 patients will need to be screened to achieve ~330 patients randomized to treatment.   
Note: patients can be reallocated from discontinued groups to increase t he power in 
groups that are continued at the discretion of the DRC.

 Study Population Characteristics  
The study will consist of patients with DED, who at the screening visit (day -14) are 
administering a conventional artificial tear for the symptoms of DED within the 30 days 
preceding the screening visit and are willing to suspend use of artificial tears for the study 
duration.

 Patients will be instructed to twist -off the tips of the unit of use containers.  They should 
not pull them off. Patients (or site staff or a caregiver) will then make a pouch with the 
lower lid and instil the study medication.   
Each patient (or caregiver) must instil  1 drop of the vehicle either tree times daily (TID) 
(once in the morning, once around mid-day, and once in the evening) or twice daily 
(BID) (once in the morning and once in the evening) to both eyes during the 2 week run-in period.  During the double- masked treatment period, each patient (or caregiver) must 
instil 1 drop of the study medication either tree times daily (TID) (once in the morning, once around mid-day, and once in the evening) or twice daily (BID) (once in the morning and once in the evening) to both eyes for 3 months.  For both the dosing regimens the morning and evening study medication doses should be instilled about 12 hours apart.  For the TID dosing regimen the mid-day medication doses should be instilled about 6 hours after the morning dose.   
One unit dose vial of the masked study medication is to be used for only 1 application to 
both eyes. The patient should be instructed to place the used vial in the used vial bag after 
use and should return used and unused vials at the next study visit.

10 STUDY METHODS AND PROCEDURES  
 Subject Entry Procedures  
10.1.1 Overview 
Subjects as defined by the criteria in section s 7.2 , 7.3, and 7.4 will be considered for 
entry into this study. 
10.1.2 Informed Consent  
Prior to a subject’s participation in the trial (i.e., prior to changes in a subject’s medical 
treatment and/or prior to study related procedures), the study will be discussed wit h each 
subject, and subjects wishing to participate must give written informed consent using an informed consent form (ICF).  The informed consent form must be the most recent version that has received approval/favorable review by a properly constituted In stitutional Review 
Board (IRB)

 10.1.4 Procedures for Final Study Entry 
Subjects must meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.  
10.1.5 Methods for Assignment to Treatment Groups: 
Prior to initiation of study run -in (at Visit 1), each subject who qualifies for entry will be 
assigned a screening number. All screening numbers will be assigned in strict numerical 
sequence at a site and no numbers will be skipped or omitted. If all incl usion and exclusion 
criteria are met at Visits 1 and 2, each qualifying subject will then be assigned a randomization number at the end of Visit 2.  
A randomization schedule will be provided to each investigational site. The 
randomization schedule will use block randomization stratified by site, such that there will be an approximate equal number of subjects assigned to each of the two treatment arms at each site for the Stage 1 , Expansion Cohort. For Stage 1, Cohorts 1-3 patients 
with signs and symptoms of DED will be randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to receive either a single concentration of AXR -159 Ophthalmic Solution or AXR-159 Ophthalmic 
Solution Vehicle. The site staff will dispense to the patient the study kit label led with the 
corresponding randomization number. The randomization number will be recorded on the patient’s source document and eCRF. New kit s will be dispensed at Visits 2, 3, and 4 
based on the subject’s randomization. The Sponsor, Investigators, and stu dy staff will be 
masked during the randomization process and throughout the study. 
During the run-in period, the patients will all be supplied with AXR-159 Ophthalmic 
Solution V ehicle.  Patients will be informed that they will receive only vehicle during the 
2-week run-in period.  Following the run-in period the patient, site personnel, the sponsor and patients will be masked to the treatment assignment for the 3 month treatment period.  All study medication will be provided in identical unit of dose vials and cartons to maintain masking of the study.   
For both Stages 1 and 2, patients with signs and symptoms of DED will be randomly 
assigned in a 4:1 (Stage 1, Cohorts 1- 3) ratio, a  1:1 (Stage 1 , Expansion Cohort ) ratio , or 
to a 2:2:2:2:1:1:1 (Stage 2) ratio  to receive either a single concentration of AXR-159 
Ophthalmic Solution or AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution V ehicle.   
For the expansion cohort in Stage 1 and Stage 2, subjects will be randomized by strata as follows: 
• Site 
• Baseline eye dryness score ≥ 60, < 60 
• Baseline inferior corneal staining > 1.5, ≤ 1.5 
Subjects will not be stratified in Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 in Stage 1.

 Schedule of Visits, Measurements and Dosing  
10.4.1 Scheduled Visits  
Refer to Appendix 1 for  a schedule of visits an d measurements.  
10.4.2 Unscheduled Visits 
These visits may be performed in order to ensure subject safety. All procedures 
performed at an unscheduled visit will be recorded in the source documents and on the 
Unscheduled Visit eCRF pages. Any procedure indicated i n the eCRF that is not 
performed should be indicated as “Not done.” 
Evaluations that may be conducted at an Unscheduled Visit include: 
• Vital Signs  
• Labs  
• Slit-lamp B iomicroscopy  
• Visual A cuity  
• Intraocular Pressure  
• Urine Pregnancy Test  
• Ophthalmoscopy 
• Assessmen t of Adverse Events 
• Assessment of concomitant medications and/or treatments 
• Any other assessments needed in the judgment of the investigator. 
 Compliance with Protocol  
Whilst subjects are dosed at site, they will receive their study treatment directly from the 
investigator or designee, under medical supervision.  The date and time of each dose 
administered in the clinic will be re corded in the source documents.  The dose of study 
treatment and study subject identification will be confirmed at the time of dosing by a 
member of the study site staff other than the person administering the study treatment. 
Subjects will be instructed on proper instillation and storage of study drug at the end of 
Visits 1, 2, 3, and 4, and given written instructions. The used and unused study drug vials will be collected at each visit from Visit 2 up to and including Visit 5 to assess dosing and symptom assessment compliance. Dosing compliance will be based off of the used and unused vial count. If the subject is less than 80% or more than 125% compliant with dosing based on the expected number of used vials, then the subject will be deemed non-
compliant and a deviation should be recorded.

10.6.1 Completed Subjects 
A completed subject is one who has not been discontinued from the study. 
10.6.2 Discontinued Subjects 
Subjects may be discontinued prior to their completion of the study due to: 
• subject request/withdrawal 
• AEs 
• protocol violations 
• administrative reasons (e.g., inability to continue, lost to follow up) 
• sponsor termination of study 
• other 
Note: In addition, any subject may be discontinued for any sound medical reason. 
Notification of a subject discontinuation and the reason for discontinuation will be made 
to Ora and/or sponsor and will be clearly documented on the CRF.  
 Study Termination  
The study may be stopped at any time by the investigator, the sponsor, and/or Ora with appropriate notification.  
 Study  Duration  
The total duration of study is approximately 3.5 months (from screening to study completion). 
 
 Monito ring and Quality Assurance  
During the course of the study a monitor, or designee, will make routine site visits to review protocol compliance, assess Investigational Product (IP )/device accountability, 
and ensure the study is being conducted according to the pertinent regulatory requirements. The review of the subjects’ medical records will be performed in a manner that adequately maintains subject confidentiality. Further details of the study monitoring 
will be outlined in a monitoring plan. 
Regulatory authorities of domestic and foreign agencies, Ora, Inc. quality assurance and 
or its designees may carry out on -site inspections and/or audits which may include source 
data checks. Therefore, direct access to the original source data will be required for 
inspections and/or audits. All inspections and audits will be carried out giving consideration to data protection as well as subject confidentiality to the extent that local, 
state, and federal laws apply.

 11 ADVERSE EVENTS 
 Adverse Event  
An AE  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an IP in 
humans, whether or not considered IP-related. An AE  can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of  an IP , without any judgment about causality. An AE  can arise 
from any use of the IP  (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug or 
medical device) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. An AE can arise from any delivery, implantation, or use of a medical device, 
including medical device failure, subject  characteristics that may impact medical device 
performance (e.g., anatomical limitations), and therapeutic parameters (e.g., energy 
applied, sizing, dose release, and anatomic fit ) associated with medical device use. 
All AEs spontaneously reported by the subject and/or in response to an open question 
from study personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination or other 
diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the source document and on the appropriate 
pages of the CRF. Any clinically relevant deterioration in clinical finding is considered an AE and must be recorded. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. 
Documentation regarding the AE  should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
severity, and relationship to IP , action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by the physicia n or reported by the subject upon indirect questioning.  
11.1.1 Severity  
Severity of an AE  is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an 
AE as determined by the investigator or reported to him/her by the subject. The 
assessment of severi ty is made irrespective of relationship to IP  or seriousness of the 
event and should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
• Mild : Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Severe:  Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of 
therapy, and interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
11.1.2 Relationship to Investigational Product  
A determination will be made of the relationship (if any) between an adverse event and 
the study drug or study procedure, as applicable.  A causal relationship is present if a determination is ma de that there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may 
have been caused by the drug or study procedure.

Clinical Trial Protocol: AXR201701/17-110-0016 Version 0.1 FINAL 17Feb18  
 
Confidential 
Page 46 
 The relationship of each AE to the IP  should be determined by the investigator using 
these explanations:  
• Suspected : A reasonable possi bility exists that the IP caused the AE. A suspected 
AE can be further defined as:  
 Definite : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence from 
the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of the drug 
class, is confirmed by improvement on stopping the IP and no other 
reasonable cause exists.  
 Probable : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence 
from the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of the drug class, is confirmed by improvement on stopping the IP and the suspect IP 
is the most likely of all causes.  
 Possible : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence 
from the time of IP administration, but could also have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or by other drugs administered to the subject. 
• Not Suspected:  A reasonable possibility does not exist that the IP caused the AE. 
• Not Related:  Concurrent illness, concurrent medication, or other known cause 
is clearly responsible for the AE, the administration of the IP and the 
occurrence of the AE are not reasonably related in time, OR exposure to IP has not occurred.  
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the IP  caused the AE . “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the IP and the AE . Types of evidence that would suggest a 
causal relationship between the IP and the AE  event include: a single occurrence of an 
event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with IP  exposure (e.g., 
angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome); one or more occurrences of an 
event that is not commonly associated with IP  exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in 
the population exposed to the IP  (e.g., tendon rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific 
events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study 
population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the IP -treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group.  
11.1.3 Expectedness 
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information 
about the IP using these explanations:  
• Unexpected: An AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
• Expected:  A n AE that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has been 
observed. 
• Not applicable: An AE unrelated to the IP.

Page 47 
 AE events that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of products or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological/mechanical ( or other) properties of the product, but 
are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular product under 
investigation are to be considered unexpected. 
The investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an AE , but the final 
classi fication is subject to the Medical Monitor’s determination.  
 Serious Adverse Events 
An AE  is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results 
in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death;  
• A life -threatening AE ; 
Note: An AE  is considered “life- threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include 
an AE  that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; 
Note: The term “inpatient hospitalization” refers to any inpatient admission (even if less than 24 hours). For chronic or long- term inpatients, inpatient admission includes transfer 
within the hospi tal to an acute/intensive care inpatient unit. Inpatient hospitalization does 
not include: emergency room visits; outpatient/same-day/ambulatory procedures; observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; hospice facilities; nursing homes; or 
clinical research/phase 1 units.  
Note: The term “prolongation of existing hospitalization” refers to any extension of an 
inpatient hospitalization beyond the stay anticipated or required for the reason for the 
initial admission as determined by the investigator or treating physician. 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
Note: A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would be 
interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g., hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer or damage to the optic nerve).  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.

 Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events 
All AEs and their outcomes must be reported to Ora, the sponsor, and the IRB/IEC as 
required by the IRB/IEC, federal, state, or local regulations and governing health 
authorities and recorded on the appropriate CRF.  
11.3.1 Reporting a Suspected Unexpected Adverse Reaction  
All AEs that are ‘suspected’ and ‘unexpected’ are to be reported to Ora, the sponsor and 
the IRB/IEC as required by the IRB/IEC, federal, state, or local regulations and governing health authorities.  
11.3.2 Reporting a Serious Adverse Event 
To ensure subject safety, all SAEs , regardless of relationship to the IP , must be 
immediately reported. All information relevant to the SAE  must be recorded on the 
appropriate CRFs . The investigator is obligated to pursue and obtain information 
requested by Ora and/or the sponsor in addition to that information reported on the CRF . 
All subjects experiencing a SAE  must be followed up and the outcome reported. 
In the event of a SAE , the investigator must notify Ora and the sponsor immediately; 
obtain and maintain in his/her files all pertinent medical records, information, and medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow -up of the 
subject; provide Ora and the sponsor with a complete case history, which includes a statement as to whether the event was or was not suspected to be related to the use of the IP; and inform the IRB of the SAE  within their guidelines for reporting SAEs .

 (AxeroVis ion Inc.) should be notified prior to unmasking study medication.  The 
investigator should inform the sponsor (AxeroVision Inc.) of the unmasking if there is no 
notification prior to the unmasking.   
A report of the results of this study may be published, sent to the appropriate health 
authorities in any country in which the study drug may ultimately be marketed, and published in part as required by appropriate health authorities (e.g., Clinical Trials 
posting and disclosure), but the patient’s name will not be disclosed in these documents.   
Patients will be informed that the study is posted and the results eventually disclosed by 
appropriate health authorities (e.g., Clinical Trials posting or freedom of information by 
the FDA).  
 Type and Duration of the Fo llow-up of Subjects after Adverse Events  
Any serious adverse event occurring during the study period (beginning with informed 
consent) and for at least 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug must be immediately reported, but no later than 24 hours after learning of a serious adverse event.  Serious adverse events must be reported to AxeroVision Inc. (or Agent of AxeroVision Inc.) as listed on the AxeroVision Inc. Study Contacts Sheet and recorded on the serious adverse event form.  All patients with a s erious adverse event must be followed up and the 
outcomes reported.  The investigator must supply AxeroVision Inc. and the IRB/IEC with 
any additional requested information (e.g., autopsy reports and discharge summaries).  
In the event of a serious adverse event, the investigator must: 
1. Notify AxeroVision Inc. immediately by fax or email using the serious adverse 
event form (contact details can be found on page 1 of the serious adverse event 
form); phone numbers and relevant AxeroVision Inc. personnel contac ts are also

12 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES AND METHODS OF ANALY SES 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide a detailed description of the planned 
statistical analysis.  
 Sample Size Determination  
The sample size is determined empirically.  Xiidra achieved a 0 .25 unit difference 
between lifitegrast ophthalmic sol ution and vehicle in mean change from baseline to day 
84 in inferior cornel staining and a standard deviation of approximately 0.75 in Phase 2. Sample sizes for this study are based on detecting a 0 .35 unit difference between the 
active and vehicle groups,  assuming a standard deviation of 0.75.  In Stage 1 the number 
of expected enrolled subjects varies between 43 and  53 subjects in the active group and  
between 37 and 47 subjects in the vehicle group.  In Stage 2 the number of expected enrolled subjects is 60 in the active group and 30 to 60 subjects in the vehicle group. Thus, the combined sample provides between 103 and 113 subjects in the active group and between 67 and 77 subjects in the matching vehicle group or between 97 and 107 subjects in the combined vehicle group.  Under these assumptions and allowing a dropout rate of 10%, sample sizes of 93 in the active treatment group and 60 in the vehicle group will yield 80% power to show a significant di fference at the α = 0.05 level using a two -
sample t -test. 
 Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations will be considered: 
• Modified Intent -to-Treat Population  – The modified intent- to-treat (m ITT) 
population includes all randomized subjects that  have baseline and at least 1 post -
baseline assessment for 1 or more of the efficacy measurements (see Section 8.1).  
The primary analysis will be performed on the mITT population with the Last 
Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) imputation method for missing values.  The 
mITT population may also be analyzed with observed data only (i.e., without LOCF) and using multiple imputation methods to assess sensitivity. S ubjec ts in the 
mITT population will be analyzed as randomized. 
• Modified Intent -to-Treat 2 Population – The modified intent- to-treat 2 (mITT2) 
population includes all subjects in the mITT population that have baseline inferior corneal staining score in the study eye > 1.5 .  The mITT2 population will be 
analyzed using LOCF.  The mITT2 population may also be analyzed using observed data only to assess sensitivity.  Subjects in the mITT2 population will be analyzed as randomized.  
• Per Protocol Population – The per pr otocol (PP) population includes subjects in the 
mITT population who do not have significant protocol deviations and who

Page 51 
 complete the study. Protocol deviations will be assessed prior to database lock and 
unmasking. The PP population will be analyzed using observed data only for 
primary efficacy variables. Subjects in the PP population will be analyzed as 
treated . 
• Safety Population – The safety population includes all randomized subjects who 
have received at least one dose of the investigational product. The safety population 
will be analyzed for all safety assessments. Subjects in the Safety population will be analyzed as treated.  
The statistical analysis of safety data will be performed for the safety population.  The 
analysis of baseline and efficacy data will be performed for the mITT population.  The primary efficacy analysis will also be performed on the mITT2 and PP populations as 
sensitivity analyses. 
 Statistical Hypotheses  
The statistical hypotheses are stated in terms of one-sided hypotheses, although statistical 
testing will be two -sided. All hypotheses are Pre-CAE®. 
H01:  There is no difference between AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution (50 mg/ml, 30 
mg/ml or 3 mg/ml, TID or BID) and vehicle (TID or BID) in the change from 
baseline to Month 3 in inferior corneal staining score in the study eye.  
H11:  The change from baseline to Month 3 in inferior corneal staining score in the 
study eye is less with AXR -159 Ophthalmic Solution (50 mg/ml, 30 mg/ml or 3 
mg/ml, TID or BID) than with vehicle (TID or BID).  
H02:  There is no difference between AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution (50 mg/ml, 30 
mg/ml or 3 mg/ml, TID or BID) and vehicle (TID or BID) in the change from baseline to Month 3 in total corneal staining score in the study eye. 
H
12:  The change from baseline to Mo nth 3 in total corneal staining score in the study 
eye is less with AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution (50 mg/ml, 30 mg/ml or 3 mg/ml, 
TID or BID) than with vehicle (TID or BID).  
H03:  There is no difference between AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution (50 mg/ml, 30 
mg/ml  or 3 mg/ml, TID or BID) and vehicle (TID or BID) in the change from 
baseline to Month 3 in eye dryness. H
13:  The change from baseline to Month 3 in eye dryness is less with AXR -159 
Ophthalmic Solution (50 mg/ml, 30 mg/ml or 3 mg/ml, TID or BID) than with 
vehicle (TID or BID).  
H04:  There is no difference between AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution (50 mg/ml, 30 
mg/ml or 3 mg/ml, TID or BID) and vehicle (TID or BID) in the change from baseline to Month 3 in total OSDI score.

 H14:  The change from baseline to Month 3 in total OSDI score is less with AXR-159 
Ophthalmic Solution (50 mg/ml, 30 mg/ml or 3 mg/ml, TID or BID) than with 
vehicle (TID or BID).  
In the hypotheses above, dosing (TID or BID) of the vehicle will match the dosing of the active treatment.   
 Statistical Analyses 
12.4.1 General Approach  
In general, continuous data will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number of 
subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) and will be analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
techniques, two- sample t -tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests for between -group 
comparisons, and paired t- tests or sign -rank tests for within -group analyses.  Categorical 
variables will be summarized by number of subjects (n), frequency counts, and percentages, and they will be analyzed using Pearson’s chi -square test or Fisher’s exact 
test (if the expected cell count is less than 5 in 25% or more of the cells).  Ordinal 
variables will be analyzed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) or the W ilcoxon 
rank- sum test for between -treatment comparisons and the sign -rank test for within -
treatment comparisons.  
All summaries will be presented by treatment group  and visit .  Summaries will be 
provided for demographics, baseline medical history, concurrent therapies, and subject disposition. 
For the purpose of summarization, medical history, concurrent therapies, and adverse 
events will be coded to MedDRA and WHO Drug dictionaries, as appropriate. 
Baseline measures are defined as the last measure prior to the initiation of study 
treatment, usually at Day 1.  If a measure is taken both pre- CAE
® and post- CAE®, the 
baseline will be the last time point matched value prior to the initiation of study 
treatment.  For post- CAE® measures, this will be at Day -14.  F or changes from pre-
CAE® to post- CAE® post first treatment, the change from pre- CAE® to post- CAE® at 
Day -14 will be considered the baseline value. 
Changes from baseline will be calculated as visit – baseline and summarized by treatment 
and visit as described above.  Treatment comparisons between an active treatment and vehicle will be calculated as active – vehicle.   
All primary and secondary analyses will be two-sided at a significance level of 0.05.  
95% confidence intervals will be provided where appropriate.  
12.4.2 Unit of Analysis 
Safety endpoints will be analyzed for both eyes.  For efficacy endpoints, the unit of 
analysis will be the study eye, or the “worst eye,” as defined by the following: 
AXR -159 ophthalmic solution  AxeroVision, Inc.   
Clinical Trial Protocol: AXR201701/17-110-0016 Version 0.1 FINAL 17Feb18  
 
Confidential 
Page 53 
 Study Eye/Worst Eye: Eyes are eligible for analysis if they meet all of the inclusion 
criteria.  In the case that both eyes are eligible for analysis, the study eye will be the eye 
with worse (higher) inferior corneal staining score (Ora Calibra® scale ) on Day 1.  If the 
inferior corneal staining score is the same in b oth eyes, then the right eye will be selected 
as the study eye. 
12.4.3 Missing Data 
The primary efficacy analyses will be performed using Last Observation Carried Forward 
(LOCF) methodology.  For the LOCF analyses of the primary efficacy variables at Month 3, the last value from the previous visits will be carried forward, matching pre -CAE
® or 
post- CAE® time points.  A pre- CAE® time point will never be imputed for a post -CAE® 
value, and vice versa.     
An analysis using observed data only will also be performed for the primary efficacy 
variables.  As additional sensitivity analyses, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation methodology may be used to impute missing data for the analyses of the primary efficacy variables.  
No secondary efficacy endpoints or safety endpoints will be imputed. 
12.4.4 Multiplicity Consideration  
This is a Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, systemic pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of AXR-159 Ophthalmic Solution in patients with dry eye disease .  
There will be no m ultiplicity adjustments for the multiple treatment groups or multiple 
primary endpoints.   
12.4.5 Primary Efficacy Analyses 
The primary efficacy variables (Pre -CAE®) are: 
• Change from Baseline to Month 3 in inferior corneal staining score ( Ora Calibra® 
scale ) in the study eye  
• Change from Baseline to Month 3 in total corneal staining score (Oxford and Ora 
Calibra® scale s) in the study eye 
• Change from Baseline to Month 3 in eye dryness measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS)  
• Change from Baseline to Month 3 in Total Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) 
score, and 
The primary variables will be summarized as described in Section 12.4.1.  The  primary 
efficacy analysis will use the mITT population with LOCF.

used to compare the change from baseline primary efficacy variables.  The ANCOVA models wil l include terms for baseline value, baseline inferior corneal staining score 
(ICCS) and baseline eye dryness score as covariates and treatment (AXR-159 or vehicle) 
as a factor  in the model.  Pairwise comparisons will be performed for each AXR-159 
treatment group versus vehicle using t- tests of the least square means from this model.  
Two-sided confidence intervals (95%) will be provided for the differences between 
treatments.   As supportive analyses, two -sample t -tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests will 
also be conducted.   
Details of additional supportive primary efficacy analyses will be provided in  the 
statistical analysis plan.  
12.4.6 Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Continuous secondary  efficacy variables (see Section  8.1.2 ) and changes from baseline in 
these measures will be  summarized as described in Section 12 .4.1, and analyzed by visit 
using ANCOVA as described for the primary efficacy analyses.   
Binary clinical cure variables representing clinical cure will be defined by visit for TBUT 
≥ 10, Schirmer’s test ≥ 10 mm, Total OSDI < 1 8, and Ocular Discomfort Score = 0.  
These binary variables will be summarized as described in Section 12.4.1.  Additionally, 
within each treatment group, shift tables for complete treatment response (yes/no) in the study eye relative to baseline will be presented for each variable.   
The Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel  test, stratified by baseline inferior corneal staining score 
(ICCS , > 1.5 and ≤ 1.5) and eye dryness score (≥ 60 and < 60) will be used to compare 
treatments with respect to the proportion of cured patients.  Pairwise comparisons will be 
performed fo r each AXR -159 treatment group versus vehicle.  Two -sided confidence 
intervals (95%) will be provided for the differences between treatments.  The confidence intervals will be constructed using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. 
The secondary efficacy analysis will use the mITT population with observed data only. 
Details of additional secondary efficacy analyses will be provided in the statistical 
analysis plan. 
12.4.7 Safety Variables  
Safety measures will be analyzed using the safety population.  Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) nomenclature will be used to code adverse events.  Incidence rates of each treatment -emergent adverse event will be summarized by primary 
system organ class and preferred term.  Summary tables wi ll be generated for all 
treatment- emergent adverse events regardless of causality as well as for those considered 
to be treatment -related.

 12.4.8 Planned Interim Analyses  
An interim analysis will be performed when the last enrolled patient in Stage 1 completes 
Month 3 of the Expansion Cohort.  There is no plan to stop the study for efficacy on the 
basis of the interim analysis.  However, termination in individual dose groups due to safety, tolerability and/or futility may occur.  Statistical significance will not be declared 
at the time of the interim analysis.   
A final database lock will occur at the completion of Stage 2 and the safety, tolerability, and efficacy data from both Stage 1 and 2 will be analyzed separately and in a combined fashion to fully leverage the advantage of this two -stage study design.  At the final 
analysis, statistical significance will be declared for two-sided p -values < 0.05.   
Given the exploratory nature of the study no adjustments for multiplicity will be applied across the p rimary or secondary endpoints. 
12.4.9 Sub-Group Analyses 
Patients will be stratified by  the Pre -CAE® inferior corneal staining score (ICCS) (i.e., ≤ 
1.5 or > 1.5) according to the Ora Calibra® staining scale and eye dryness score (i .e., <  60 
or ≥ 60) in the study eye.       
Subgroup analyses are planned for the 4 groups defined by the 2 stratification factors 
(Pre-CAE®): 
1. inferior corneal staining score (ICCS) ≤ 1.5 according to the Ora Calibra® staining 
scale and eye dryness score < 60  
2. inferior corneal staining score (ICCS) ≤ 1.5 according to the Ora Calibra® staining 
scale and eye dryness score ≥ 60 
3. inferior corneal staining score (ICCS) > 1.5 according to the Ora Calibra® staining 
scale and eye dryness score < 60  
4. inferior corneal staining  score (ICCS)  > 1.5 according to the Ora Calibra® staining 
scale and eye dryness score ≥ 60. 
12.4.10Tabulation of Individual Participant Data  
Individual participant data will be listed by measure and time point.  
12.4.11Exploratory Analyses  
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide a detailed description of the planned 
exploratory statistical analysis.  
12.4.12 Pharmacokinetics Analyses  
A model independent approach will be used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters 
of AXR-159 in blood.  Pharmacokinetic parameters for blood will only be calculated for 
samples collected from patients who receive study treatment  (Stage 1, the first 40 patients 
in the expansion cohort) .  To enable only bioanalysis of samples from patients who 
receive active AXR-159 treatment, the randomiz ation codes will be made available based

under the curve from time 0 to t (AUC 0-t), AUC from time 0 to infinity (AUC 0-∞), C max, 
time to highest observed concentration (T max), and half- life (T 1/2) will be calculated when 
possible. 
The concentration of AXR-159 in blood and tear samples will be summarized by dose 
and timepoint using descriptive statistics, if applicable. 
13 COMPLIANCE WITH GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICES, ETHICAL CONSIDER ATIONS, AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
ISSUES 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, current Good Clinical 
Practices (GCPs), including the International Conference on Harmonis ation (ICH)

 APPENDIX 2: EXAMINATION PROCEDURES, TEST S, 
EQUIPMENT, AND TECHNIQUES  
Visual Acuity Procedures (ETDRS Chart)  
LogMAR visual acuity (VA) must be assessed using an Early Treatment Diabetic 
Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. The procedure used will be consistent with the recommendations provided for using the ETDRS eye chart. VA should be evaluated at the beginning of each visit in the study (i.e., prior to slit- lamp examination). VA testing 
should be done with most recent correction. 
Equipment 
The VA chart to be used is the ETDRS chart. If smaller reproduction (18"  by 18", e.g., 
from Prevent Blindness) wall charts are used, the subject viewing distance should be exactly 10 feet (or as specified by the manufacturer). In ALL cases, for purposes of standardizing the testing conditions during the study, all sites must use only the 'R' charts, and the right eye should be tested first. For reflectance (wall) charts, the chart should be placed frontally and well- illuminated.  
Measurement Technique 
The chart should be at a comfortable viewing angle. The right eye should be tested first. The subject should attempt to read each letter, line-by- line, left to right, beginning with 
line 1 at the top of the chart. The subject should be told that the chart has letters only, no numbers. If the subject reads a number, he or she should be reminded that the chart contains no numbers, and the examiner should then request a letter in lieu of the number. The subject should be asked to read slowly, so as to achieve the best identification of each letter. He/she is not to proceed to the next letter until he/she has given a definite response.  
If the subject changes a response (e.g. , that wa s a "C" not an "O") before he has read 
aloud the next letter, then the change must be accepted. If the subject changes a response having read the next letter, then the change is not to be accepted. The examiner should never point to the chart or to specifi c letters on the chart during the test.  
A maximum effort should be made to identify each letter on the chart. When the subject says he or she cannot read a letter, he or she should be encouraged to guess. If the subject identifies a letter as 1 of 2 letter s, he or she should be asked to choose 1 letter and, if 
necessary, to guess. When it becomes evident that no further meaningful readings can be made, despite encouragement to read or guess, the examiner should stop the test for that eye. However, all lette rs on the last line should be attempted as letter difficulties vary and 
the last may be the only one read correctly. The number of letters missed or read incorrectly should be noted.

 LogMAR Visual Acuity Calculations  
The last line in which a letter is re ad correctly will be taken as the base logMAR reading. 
To this value will be added the number "N x 0.02" where 'N' represents the total number 
of letters missed up to and included in the last line read. This total sum represents the logMAR VA for that eye. 
For e xample: Subject correctly reads 4 of 5 letters on the 0.2 line, and 2 of 5 letters on the 
0.1 line. 
Base logMAR  = 0.1 
N (total number of letters incorrect on line 0.2 as 
well as 0.1) = 4 
N x T (T=0.02) = 0.08 
Base logMAR + (N x T)  = 0.1 + 0.08 
logMAR VA = 0.18 
Repeat the procedure for the left eye.  
In order to provide standardized and well-controlled assessments of VA during the study, all VA assessments at a single site must be consistently done using the same lighting conditions and same correction if possible during the entire study. If the same correction cannot be used (i.e., a subject forgets his glasses), the reason for the change in correction should be documented. 
Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy Procedures 
Slit lamp biomicroscopic observations will be graded as Normal or Abnormal. Abnormal findings will be categorized as clinically significant (findings that may interfere with study parameters or otherwise confound the data as determined by the investigator) or not clinically significant (NCS). The following will be examined:  
• Cornea  
• Conjunctiva 
• Anterior Chamber  
• Iris 
• Lens  
• Eyelid

 External magnification and biomicroscopy will be performed using a slit-lamp. 
Magnification will be consistent with standard clinic al practice. The subject will be 
seated.  
Fundus Exams 
Dilated fundus exams will be performed at Visit 1  using indirect ophthalmoscopy. At 
visit 5, undilated fundus exams will be performed unless dilation is necessary. The 
investigator will make observations of the vitreous, retina, macula, choroid and optic nerve.   
Observations will be graded as Normal or Abnormal. Abnormal findings that are 
clinically significant (as determined by the investigator that may interfere w ith study 
parameters or otherwise confound the data) and those that are not clinically significant will be d escribed. An indirect Fundoscopy examination should be performed if retinal 
disease is detected.  
• Vitreous: Examination should emphasize the visual axis.  
• Retina, Macula, Choroid: Include an observation of the retina and its blood 
vessels. Eyes should be excluded from the study if active inflammation is present.  
• Optic Nerve: Significant damage or cupping to the optic nerve should be noted. 
 
It is recommended that tropicamide 1% ophthalmic solution be used to dilate subjects.   
Vital Signs 
Each subject will have vital signs assessments (resting blood pressure and pulse) conducted at Visits 1, 2, and 5. Vital signs are to be conducted by a qualified staff 
member who may be any of the following: a board -certified investigator or sub -
investigator, nurse practitioner, registered nurse, or physician assistant.  
Systolic /Diastolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)  
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure should be measured in the same arm each time using 
a sphygmomanometer with the subjects who have been in a resting state (seated upright) at least 5 minutes. Blood pressure will be recorded in mmHg. 
Pulse (bpm) 
Pulse will be measured with the subjects who have been in a resting state (seated) for at 
least 5 minutes. Pulse will be counted for 30 seconds and multiplied by 2, and recorded in beats per minute (bpm).

Intraocular Pressure  
Intraocular pressure (IOP) will be measured in each eye by contact tonometry by the 
examiner and the results will be recorded in mmHg.   A single measurement is made to 
obtain a determination of IOP.   The same tonometer employing the investigator’s 
standard  technique will be used throughout the study.  In addition, all reasonable efforts 
will be made to have the same examiner obtain all IOP measurements for a given subject.

Page 73 Tear Film Break -Up Time (TFBUT) ©  
The examiner will instill 5 µL of 2% preservative- free sodium fluorescein solution into 
the inferior conjunctival cul-de-sac of each eye.  To thoroughly mix the fluorescein with 
the tear film, the subject will be instructed to blink several times.  In order to achieve maximum fluoresc ence, the examiner should wait approximately 30 seconds after 
instillation before evaluating TFBUT.    
With the aid of a slit -lamp, the examiner will monitor the integrity of the tear film, noting 
the time it takes to form micelles from the time that the e ye is opened.  TFBUT will be 
measured in seconds using a stopwatch and a digital image recording system for the right 
eye followed by the left eye.  A Wratten #12 yellow filter will be used to enhance the ability to grade TFBUT.   
For each eye, 2 measurements will be taken and averaged unless the 2 measurements are 
> 2 seconds apart and are each < 10 seconds, in which case, a third measurement wouldbe taken and the 2 closest of the 3 would be averaged.
Fluorescein Staining 
The examiner will instill 5 µL of 2% preservative -free sodium fluorescein solution into 
the inferior conjunctival cul-de- sac of each eye. In order to achieve maximum 
fluorescence, the examiner should wait approximately 3- 5 minutes after instillation 
before evaluating fluorescein staining. A Wratten #12 yellow filter will be used to enhance the ability to grade fluorescein staining. The staining will be graded with the Oxford Scale and Ora Calibra
® Scale.  
Oxford Grading Scale  
Fluorescein  staining is represented by punctate dots on a series of panels (A -E). Staining 
ranges from 0-5 for each panel and 0-10 for the total exposed inter-palpebral conjunctiva. Inferior, superior, and Central regions will be graded separately. The dots are order ed on 
a log scale. Conjunctiva: temporal zone grading performed when the subject looks nasally; grading nasally by looking temporally.

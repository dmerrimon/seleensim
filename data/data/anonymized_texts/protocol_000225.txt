Clinical Trial Protocol
Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALMETHODOLOGY
This is a prospective, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel trial in subjects with PWS between 10and 18years of age 
with genetically confirmed diagnosis of PWS anda documented nutritional phase 3 based on the criteria of Miller et al, 
2011 . Since PWS is a rare condition, and individuals with PWS are generally treated at a few centers of excellence 
throughout the country, it is expected that a significant proportion of eligible subjects will reside at a considerable 
geographic distance from the investigational site(s), requiring ground or air transportation to complete trial visits . The trial
design considers both the geographic challenges, as well as the need to ensure subjects’ home -life “normalcy” during the 
trial in order to accurately assess treatment effect . The trial includes a Screening Period, a 14-day Treatment Period, and a 
Follow -Up Period . Subjects, along with their parent/ caregiver, will be required to visit the investigational site 4 times over 
the course of the trial and particip ate in 2 phone call assessments . 
Visit 1: Screening Period (Day -7 to Day 0)
Visit 2: Baseline 1stday dosing on site (Day 1)
Visit 3:  2ndday dosing on site (Day 2)
Phone call assessment (Day 8 ±1)
Visit 4: End -of-Treatment Visit (Day 15)
Follow -up phone call (Day 19 ±3)
Following appropriate informed consent procedures, subjects will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility 
before randomization . Screening evaluations include a physical examination , vital signs, 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG), 
and laboratory assessments -hematology, clinical chemistry, hemostasis, and urinalysis . After randomization, efficacy 
measures and other assessments, including physical examination, vital signs, and collection of blood samples for clinical 
laborato ry and pharmacokinetic evaluation, will be performed at selected visits according to the Trial Flow Chart ( Table 1). 
Subjects will be closely monitore d for adverse events throughout the trial .
Prior to first dosing at the investigational site, parents/caregivers will be trained on the proper use of the nasal spray device 
and procedures for investigational medicinal product (IMP) home delivery . Parents/caregivers will be instructed to 
administer 3 intranasal spray pumps of blinded IMP per nostril 3 times daily before meals within the following intervals:
Morning dose: 06:00 a.m. –09:00 a.m.
Midday dose: 11:00 a.m. –1:00 p.m.
Evening dose: 4:30 p.m. –6:00 p.m.
Initial IMP dosing at Visit 2 (Day 1) and Visit 3 (Day 2) will take place under observation of the site staff at the 
investigational site . Subject vital signs will be monitored prior to and after IMP dosing at 30 -minute intervals for 2 hours 
after each dose .IMP will be shipped by central pharmacy directly to the subject’s residence on regular intervals as needed 
for the duration of the T reatment Period .  IMP will be administered by parents/ caregivers 3 times per day before meals 
within the above -specified dosing intervals . The IMP will require refrigeration during shipment to and during storage until 
administered . 
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS
Approximately 38 male or female subjects 10 -18 years of age ,with genetically confirmed diagnosis of PWS and
documented nutritional phase 3 PWS criteria (based on Miller et al, 2011) ,will be randomized .

Clinical Trial Protocol
Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALMEDICINAL PRODUCTS
The IMPs to be used in this trial are:
Carbetocin intranasal spray – Carbetocin dissolved in sterile sodium chloride solution 0.9%
Carbetocin Powder for Solution for Nasal Spray, 160 mg
Sodium chloride solution 0.9%, sterile
The preweighed carbetocin powder to be reconstituted with the sodium chloride solution and subsequently 
transferred to a nasal spray device
Each spray pump actuation will deliver a 50 µL volume of solution containing 1.6 mg carbetocin; each dose 
will consist of 3 spray pump actuations in each nostril to deliver a total of 9.6 mg carbetocin
Placebo intranasal spray – sterile sodium chloride solution 0.9%
Sterile sodium chloride solution 0.9% to be transferred to a nasal spray device
Each spray pump actuation will deliver 50 µL volume of solution ;each dose will consist of 3 spray pump 
actuations in each nostril
DURATION OF TREATMENT
For each subject, there will be 14 days of treatment with either intranasal carbetocin or placebo .
STATISTICAL METHODS
Sample Size: 
Based on the available literature (Dykens et al 2007) , the baseline HPWSQ -R total score is assumed to be normally 
distributed with a standard deviation of 6.12, and the standard deviation of the change between baseline (Visit 2) andVisit 4 
is estimated to be b etween 5 and 6.  With 30 subject s eligible for the primary efficacy assessment, the trialhas at least 80% 
power to detect a borderline statistically significant difference ( 1-sided 10% significance) betw een 2groups when the true 
treatment group difference is -5 under the standard deviation of 5 to 6.  Subjects are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either 
placebo or carbetocin.  
The efficacy of carbetocin will be assessed by change in HPWSQ- R total score from Visit 2 ( baseline) to Visit 4. Assuming 
a dropout rate of approximately 20%, at least 19 subjects per treatment arm will need to be randomized to have a total of 30 
subjects eligible for the primary efficacy assessment.
Primary Analysis:
The primary endpoint will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance model with treatment and site as fixed effects and 
HPWSQ -R total score at Visit 2 (baseline) as a covariate. The last observation carried forward method will be used to carry 
forward non-missing values of HPWSQ -R total score during the phone call assessment (Day 8 ±1) to impute missing values 
of HPWSQ -R total score at Visit 4. The treatment group difference in total score between placebo and carbetocin will be 
calculated by subtracting the mean change from baseline in placebo from that in the carbetocin group.  A borderline 
statistically significant difference at the 10% significant level will be achieved if the upper limit of the 90% 1-sided 
confidence interval for the treatment differe nce is less than zero.
The secondary endpoints will be analyzed using a similar model to that of the primary endpoint.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIAL1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
Prader -Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder that occurs in approximately 1 out of every 16,000 
births (1).This rare, complex, and multisystem genetic disorder is caused by the lack of expression of 
paternally inherited imprinted genes on chromosome 15q11- q13 that can occur via 1 of 3 main 
mechanisms: paternal microdeletion, maternal uniparental disomy, and imprinting defect ( 2,3).
The course and natural history of PWS have classically been described as consisting of 2 distinct 
clinical stages . The first stage occurs during the neonatal and early infancy period, characterized by 
varying degrees of hypotonia, weak cry, poor suck reflex, feeding difficulties (failure to thrive), 
developmental delay, temperature instability, and underdeveloped sex organs (hypogonadism) . 
Motor 
and language development delays are also notable during this first stage . The neonatal symptoms 
typically improve by 9-25 months of age, muscle tone improves, the child becomes more alert, appetite 
increases, and weight begins to normalize. 
The second stage of PWS (beginning ~2-
4 years of age) is characterized b y weight gain, onset and 
escalation of hyperphagia, and continued growth and developmental delays . In addition, as 
hyperphagia emerges, a separate and distinctly negative constellation of maladaptive or problematic 
behaviors is observed
. These maladaptive (or problematic) behaviors include temper tantrums, 
depression, stubbornness, obsessive compulsivity , and sudden acts of violence. By the time persons 
with PWS reach chronological adolescence, unless obesity is life -
threatening, behavioral 
difficulties often severe become the central issue for individuals with the syndrome and their families
(4).  
More recently, Miller et al described the much more gradual and complex progression of the nutritional 
phases of PWS than that of the traditional 2 stages described in the literature (5).Miller characterized 
the PWS nutritional phases by assessing growth, metabolic, and laboratory changes. Miller’s reporting 
of the progression of PWS nutritional phases is considered to be a foundation for family counseling, 
pa
tient management, and development of rational therapies. 
1.2 Scientific Justification for Conducting the Trial
Development of rational therapies for PWS is challenging and there are no approved drug products to 
treat the complex behavioral symptoms, including hyperphagia . Both children and adults with PWS 
can be particularly difficult to trial. Shortened attention spans and reduced tolerance for things that are 
difficult for the individual, combined with expressive language difficulties and slower than normal 
processing speeds frequently lead to behavioral refusals to complete testing protocols . Therefore, in 
addition to expert clinical assessment, contributory proxy or caregiver information is necessary for 
both clinical management and research trials

Clinical Trial Protocol
Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALThe neurohypophyseal hormone, oxytocin, previously thought to only be responsible for milk ejection 
and uterine contraction during labor, has recently been identified as an important neurotransmitter and 
key modulator of behavior. Numerous non- clinical and clini cal studies, including a small, single- dose, 
pilot study in PWS subject s suggest that oxytocin delivered via the nasal route will provide therapeutic 
benefit in treating both hyperphagia and negative behaviors in PWS (6).
Although there may be some positiv e clinical data, nasal oxytocin does not represent an ideal therap y. 
Oxytocin is not receptor -selective and, due to its considerable vasopressin V2 receptor activity, it 
carries the risk of prolonged antidiuresis and hyponatremia ( 7,8,9). Since some subject s with PWS are 
known to have polydipsia and low baseline serum sodium levels ( 10)adding an anti -diuretic increases 
the risk of serious complications due to hyponatremia . 
Therefore, a receptor -selective compound would 
be preferable to avo id these potential side -effects.
Carbetocin (FE 992097) is a selective oxytocin receptor agonist that has 2 amino acid substitutions 
from the native ligand, oxytocin. Due to the improved selectivity profile and established safety in 
humans, Ferring has ini tiated development of this molecule for the treatment of children and adults 
with PWS . 
1.3
Benefit / Risk Aspects
Carbetocin injection was first approved in Canada in June 1997 . As of March 2013, the cumulative 
patient exposure for carbetocin is estimated to be more than 3.5 million patients in 71 countries outside 
the United States, where carbetocin is approved
as DURATOBAL, DURATOCIN, LONACTENE, and 
PABAL for prevention of uterine atony and excessive bleeding following delivery of the infant by 
caesarean se ction under epidural or spinal 
anesthesia, for which it is administered as a 100 μg 
intravenous injection over 1 minute. No important safety concerns have been identified in non- clinical 
safety studies designed for the trial population and the route of administration or with the use of 
carbetocin in clinical trials or in post -marketing exposure.

3.1 Overall Trial Design
3.1.1 Overall Design and Control Methods
This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled parallel trialin subjects with PWS 
between the ages of 10 and 18 years of age with genetically confirmed diagnosis of PWS and a 
documented nutritional phase 3 symptom criteria as defined by Miller et al 2011.[ 5]  The trial includes 
a Screening Pe riod, a 14 -day Treatment Period, and a Follow- Up Period. Subjects, along with their 
parent/caregiver , will be required to visit the investigational site 4 times over the course of the trial, 
and participate in 2 phone call assessments. 
Visit 1: Screening Period (Day 
-7to Day 0)
Visit 2: Baseline 1stday dosing on site (Day 1)
Visit 3:  2ndday dosing on site (Day 2)
Phone call assessment (Day 8)
Visit 4: End -of-Treatment Visit (Day 15)
Follow -up phone call (Day 19 ±3)
Following appropriate informed consent procedures, subjects will undergo screening evaluations to 
determine eligibility before randomization . Screening evaluations include a physical examination ,  
vital signs, height, weight, 12- lead electrocardiogram (ECG), nasal examination, and laboratory 
assessments - hematology, clinical chemistry, hemostasis, and urinalysis . Approximately 38 eligible 
male or female subjects will be randomized at Visit 2 to1 of 2 treatment groups for 14 days:
Carbetocin : each spray pump actuation will deliver a 50 µL volume of solution containing 
1.6
mg carbetocin; each dose will consist of 3 spray pump actuations in each nostril to deliv er a 
total of 9.6 mg carbetocin
Placebo :  each spray pump actuation will deliver a 50 µL volume of sterile sodium chloride 
solution 0.9%; each dose will consist of 3 spray pump actuations in each nostril
After randomization, efficacy measures and other assessments, including physical examination, vital 
signs, nasal examination, and collection of blood samples for clinical laboratory and pharmacokinetic 
(PK) evaluation, will be performed at selected visits according to Table 1. Subjects will be closely 
monitored for adverse events throughout the trialfollowing informed consent.

Placebo is a standard control used to ensure unbiased estimates for the effects of active treatment . The 
14-day duration of treatment was considered sufficient to observe the onset of efficacy for an active 
treatment of PWS.

Clinical Trial Protocol
Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALSince PWS is a rare condition, and subjects with PWS are generally treated at a few centers of 
excellence throughout the country, it is expected that a significant proportion of eligible subjects will 
reside at a considerable geographic distance from the investigational site(s), requiring ground or air 
transportation to complete trialvisits . The trial design considers both the geographic challenges, as 
well as the need to ensure subjects’ home -life “normalcy” during the trial in order to accurately assess 
treatment effect . 
3.5.2 Selection of Endpoints
HPWSQ- Responsiveness (HPWSQ -R)
The Hyperphagia in Prader- Willi Syndrome questionnaire (HPWSQ) is an informant -based measure 
originally developed by Elisabeth Dykens (Vanderbilt) 
as a comprehensive tool to examine the 
psychological, developmental and neurobiological correlates of hyperphag iain PWS (11).HPWSQ -R 
represents all 11 items from the original HPWSQ , structured to include a 1- week recall period. The 
HPWSQ -R is designed to be used for repeated measures to evaluate the change in hyperphagia severity 
after intervention .
CGI
CGI rating scales are commonly used measures of symptom severity, treatment response and the 
efficacy of treatments in treatment studies of subjects with psychiatric, neurological or behavioral 
disorders (12).CGI is an overall clinician -determined summary measure th at takes into account all 
available information in cluding knowledge of the subject ’s history, psychosocial circumstances, 
symptoms, behavior, and the impac t of the symptoms on the subject ’s ability to function (13).The CGI 
measures 3 components: 1) severit y of illness, 2) global improvement, and 3) effic acy index 
(comparison of subject 's baseline condition with a ratio of current therapeutic benefit to severity of side 
effects).
The rationale for using CGI in an interventional trialof subject s with PWS is supported by a body of 
evidence and its usefulness in determining baseline functioning prior to starting a treatment and in 
evaluating treatment effect with the CGI -Improvement score (CGI
-I).  Given its ease of use and ability 
to capture behavior that has occurred in the last 7 days, it is an effective tool for clinicians.  It also 
allows for sizable amounts of information to be summarized and yields an easily understood score as 
well as the potential for benchmarking PWS against several pediatric maladapti ve behavioral type 
indications. 
Children’s Yale- Brow n Obsessive Compulsive Scale (C Y-BOCS)
People with PWS often have o bsessive compulsive symptoms, both food and non -food related , 
including repeated questioning, insistence on sameness, re- arranging items until they are “just right” 
and hoarding. 
The CY -BOCS is a clinician rated, semi-structured inventory of specific symptoms and

components: the Symptom Checklist and Severity Scale. The 10 severity items are summed to produce 
an Obsessions Severity Score (5 items), Compulsions Severity Score (5
items), and Total score (sum of 
all 10severity items). CY -BOCS is well researc hed in psychometric studies with reported treatment 
sensitivity (14,15,16,17,18).
Food Domain of the Reiss Profile
Several indications may encompass hyperp hagic behavior as part of the constellation of 
maladaptive behaviors encountered. However, unlike PWS, these indications are not considered 
“hyper phagia centric”. In unpublished pilot work, Dykens used the Food Domain of the Reiss 
Profile to simply document the frequency distribution of the 5items in 64 people with PWS.  The 
mean BMI of the subject s was 30.82 (SD, 10.31; range: 16.6 -64.4), and mean age was 17.33 (SD, 
10.79; range: 4.25 -48.6). The majority of participants (from 81% to 97%) enjoyed ea ting, always 
thought about food, became upset if meals were delayed, and had hearty appetites. Parents 
endorsed the “always eating” item less frequently (55%), due to the needs for food limits, diets 
and supervision around food in PWS. In a second, publish ed study by Dykens and Rosn er [19], 
the 5 items that comprise the Food Domain from the Reiss Profile was used to evaluate 94 
subjects with PWS, Williams syndrom e or Down syndrome . Subjects were evaluated at 3 time 
points, tested 2years apart. The results showed that persons with PWS had significantly higher 
scores in the Reiss Profile food domain than either score for subjects with Williams syndrome or 
Down syndrome at all measurement time points .
3.5.3 Blinding
Blinding
The trial treatment(s) will be allocated according to computer -generated randomization codes prepared 
for all trialsites. The randomization assignment will be available to the unbli nded pharmacist (at the 
site and central pharmacy), but not to any other person involved in the conduct and evaluation of the 
trial, until the trialdatabase is locked.
Prior to the start of the trial, the investigator will assign a pharmacist to act as the unblinded site 
pharmacist. This person will be the only person unblinded to the subject’s treatment group at the site
and will be responsible for randomization, mixing
,and distribution of the trial drug at Visits 2 &
3.
A central pharmacy will be utilized by Ferring to prepare and distribute unmixed drug kits to trialsites 
(to be mi xed and administered by the site during Visit 2 & 3) and to provide pre -mixedtrialdrug to 
subjects and their parent/caregiver once the at- home portion of the trialcommences.

Unblinding of Individual Subject Treatment
In case of an emergency, the emergency decoding envelope will be available to the investigator and the 
sponsor's medical officer. Breaking of the blind in individual subjects is only permitted in case of a 
serious, unexpected or other important adverse event , when the k nowledge of the investigational 
medicinal product in question is required for therapeutic decisions for the management of the subject.
As far as the emergency permits, the need to break the blind will be agreed by the investigator and the 
sponsor. The investigator should document why, when and by whom the blind is broken.
In case of accidental unblinding, the same documentation as for emergency unblinding must be 
obtained, i.e., the code envelope must be opened and why, when, and by whom must be noted both on 
the code envelope and the subject’s medical records.
It may be necessary to unblind an individual subject’s treatment for the purposes of expedited reporting 
to the authorities and/or IRBs. In that situation, every effort will be made to maintain b linding of 
sponsor personnel involved in trialconduct, data analysis and interpretation. Only those individuals 
within Ferring Pharmaceuticals whose responsibility it is to report this information will know the 
identity of the IMP. Every attempt will be m ade to ensure that all other trialand site personnel will 
continue to remain blinded throughout the course of the trial . Information on whether the blind has 
been broken for any subjects must be collected before the database is declared clean and is rele ased to 
the statistician.
3.5.4 Selection of Doses in the Trial
A non- clinical program designed to address the safety of the pediatric trial population and the route of 
administration , comprising chronic 6 months juvenile repeated dose toxicity studies after int ranasal 
administration in both rat and dog, and reproductive toxicity studies investigating fertility and embryo -
fetal development,
demonstrated satisfactory exposure margins and was considered sufficient to 
support commencement of the planned Phase 2a trial.A placebo-controlled combined single ascending 
dose and multiple -dose trial, with a crossover intravenous and nasal administration portion, in healthy 
adult human subjects to determine the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and absolute 
bioavailability of nasal carbetocin was completed in December 2012. The absolute bioavailability was 
2.5%. No safety signals were observed up to the highest dose tested (9.6 mg) in either the single 
ascending dose or multiple- dose part . Pharmacokinetic data indicat e linear pharmacokinetics over the 
dose range with respect to area under the concentration- time curve and maximum observed plasma 
concentration tested.

3.5.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Prior to first dosing at the investigational site, parents/ caregivers will be trained on the proper use of 
the nasal spray device and procedures for IMP home delivery . Parents/c aregivers will be instructed to 
administer 3 intranasal spray pumps of blinded IMP per nostril 3 times daily before meals within the 
following intervals:
Morning dose:      06: 00 a.m. –09:00 a.m.
Midday dose:      11: 00 a.m. –1:00 p.m.
Evening dose:      4:30 p.m. – 6:00 p.m.
Initial IMP dosing at Visit 2 (Day 1) and Visit 3 (Day 2) will take place under observation of the site 
staff at the investigational site. Subject vital signs will be mon itored prior to and after IMP dosing at 
30-minute intervals for 2 hours after each dose .
Subsequent IMP will be administered by 
parents/ caregivers 3 times per day before meals within the above specified dosing intervals . 
3.5.6 Withdrawal Criteria
Every subject has the right to refuse further participation in the trialat any time and without providing 
reasons. 
A subject's participation is to terminate immediately upon his/her request . The investigator 
should obtain and document the reason for the s ubject’s withdrawal, if possible.
If, at the time of refusal, a dose of the IMP has already been administered, the subject must be advised 
to agree to follow -
up safety investigations, which will include all procedures outlined for the End -of-
Treatment Visi t (Visit 4) – before withdrawal/discontinuation of the trial.
The subject may be withdrawn from the trial at any time at the discretion of the investigator; the reason 
should be discussed with the sponsor prior to discontinuing the subject and fully docume nted in the site 
source documents. 
Should the subject, during the course of the trial, develop conditions, which would 
have prevented his/her entry into the trialaccording to the exclusion criteria, the subject must be 
withdrawn immediately . 
The withdraw al of subjects from the trial will be agreed upon by the investigator and the sponsor .

present as L -enantiomers. The 2 amino acids, L -O-methyl tyrosine and L 1-carboxypropylcysteine, are 
unnatural . The drug product for nasal administration is a solution consisting of the drug substance 
carbetocin dissolved in 5 mL of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride. 
Placebo will be a sterile sodium chloride solution 0.9% to be transferred to a nasal spray device.
Carbetocin Powder for Solution for Nasal Spray, 160 mg is preweighed in a glass vial for 
reconstitution with sterile sodium chloride solution 0.9%, and subsequent transfer to a nasal spray 
device.
5.2 Characteristics and Source of Supply
All medicinal drug products are provided by Ferring Pharmaceuticals /Ferring entity and will be 
handled according to the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) .
The IMP components will be delivered to the central pharmacy as pre -weighed carbetocin in vials and 
sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution for reconstitution . After reconstitution, the IMP will be 
transferred to the glass container of the metered-dose nasal spray device, and the spray pump will be 
attached .
A central pharmacy will prepare/ship intranasal IMP kits for onsite mixing/dosing followed by 
preparing/shipping reconstituted IMP for off-sitedosing.
IMP kitsformixing and dosing will be delivered to the investigational site for dosing on Visit 2 
(Day 1), Visit 3 (Day 2) , and to provide IMP for off -site dosing on Day 3.
Reconstituted IMP shipments to the subject’s home for subsequent dosing will be made via special

5.4 Blinding / Unblinding
5.4.1 Blinding
The randomization list will not be available to any person involved in the conduct and evaluation of the 
trial until the trial database is declared clean and is released to the stat istician.
The randomization list will be available only to the unblinded pharmacist(s) preparing the dilut ed 
solutions in the spray vial.
5.4.2 Unblinding of Individual Subject Treatment
An emergency decoding envelope will be available to the investigator and de signated persons at 
Ferring. 
Breaking of the blind for individual subjects in emergency situations is only permitted in case of a 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) or in case of an important adverse event 
where the knowledge of the IMP in question is required for therapeutic decisions for the management 
of the subject.
As far as the emergency permits, the need to break the blind will be agreed by the investigator and
Ferring. The person who opens a code envelope must record the reason and the date of opening, and 
then sign and date the opened envelope. The inves tigator must record the event of unblinding in the 
subject’s medical record, including the reason for unblinding, but not the treatment allocation if this 
can be avoided.
In case of accidental unblinding, the same documentation as for emergency unblinding must be 
obtained, i.e. the code envelo pe must be opened and why, when and by whom must be noted.

8.1 Adverse Event Definition
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical trial. It 
includes:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally associated with the use 
of the IMP, whether or not considered to be caused by the IMP.
Adverse events commonly observed and adverse events anticipated based on the 
pharmacological effect of the IMP.
Any laboratory abnormality, vital sign or finding from physical (or gynecological )examination 
assessed as clinically significant by the investigator ( note: findings from assessments and 
examinations done during screening are not adverse events, but a re recorded as medical 
history) .
Accidental injuries, reasons for any change in medication (drug and/or dose), reasons for any 
medical, nursing or pharmacy consultation, or reasons for admission to hospital or surgical 
procedures.
Overdoses and medication errors with and without clinical consequences.
An adverse drug reaction is an adverse event evaluated by the investigator as being probably or 
possibly causally related to treatment with the IMP. 
A serious adverse drug reaction is a serious adverse event (SAE) evaluated by the investigator and/or 
by Ferring as having a reasonable possibility of causal association with IMP.
An unexpected adverse event is an adverse event not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the 
section “Undesirable Effects” in the sponsor’s current Investigator’s Brochure.
A treatment-emergent adverse event is any adverse event that begins during the Treatment Period or 
worsening of a pre- existing medical condition. The Treatment Period is the period during which a 
subjec t receives IMP.
8.2 Collection and Recording of Adverse Events
8.2.1 Collection of Adverse Events
The investigator must monitor the condition of the subject throughout the trial from the time of 
obtaining informed consent until the Day 19 follow -up phone call .

The subject’s response to questions about his/her health (a standard non -leading question such 
as “How have you been feeling since your last visit?” is asked at each visit).
Symptoms spontaneously reported by the subject.
Investigations and examinations where the findings are assessed by the investigator to be 
clinically significant changes or abnormalities.
Other information relating to the subject’s health becoming known to the investigator 
(e.g.,hospitalization ).
8.2.2 Record ing of Adverse Events
The investigator must record all adverse events in the Adverse Event Log provided in each subject’s 
eCRF with information about:
Adverse event
Date and time of onset (time can be omitted, if applicable)
Intensity
Causal relationship to IMP
Action taken to IMP
Other action taken
Date and time of outcome (time can be omitted, if applicable)
Outcome
Serio usness
Each of the items in the Adverse Event Log is described in detail in the following sections.
Adverse Event
Adverse events should be recorded as diagnoses, if available. If not, separate signs and symptoms 
should be recorded. One diagnosis/symptom should be entered per record.
If a subject suffers from the same adverse event more than once and the subject recovers in between 
the events, the adverse events should be recorded separately. If an adverse event changes in intensity, a

duration of the event.a
Pre-existing conditions are not AEs, but become AEs if worsening occurs after IMP administration 
during the trial. Pre -existing clinically significant conditions diagnosed or observed as a result of the 
screening procedures must be recorded as medical history . 
Note: A procedure is not an adverse event; the reason for conducting the procedure is. Hospitalization
is not an adverse event; the reason for hospitalization is. Death is not an adverse event, but the cause of 
death is (an exception is sudden death of unknown cause, which is an adverse event).
Date and Time of Onset
The date of onset is the date when the first sign(s) or symptom(s) were first noted. If the adv erse event 
is an abnormal clinically significant laboratory test or outcome of an examination, the onset date is the 
date the sample was taken or the examination was performed. 
Intensity
The intensity of an adverse event must be classified using the following 3-point scale:
Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity.
Moderate: Event sufficient to affect usual activity (disturbing).
Severe: Inability to work or perform usual activities (unacceptable).
                                                
aException: if an adverse event with onset before the first IMP administration (i.e., a pre -treatment adverse event) 
changes in intensity, this must be recorded as 2 separate events. The initial adverse event should be recorded with 
outcome “not yet recover ed” and the date and time of outcome is when the intensity changed. The second adverse 
event should be recorded with date and time of onset when the intensity changed.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALCausal Relationship to IMP
The possibility of whether the IMP caused the adverse event must be classified as one of the following:
Reasonable possibility: 
There is evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship between the IMP and the adverse event. 
The adverse event may occur as part of the pharmacological action of the IMP or may be unpredictable 
in its occurrence.
Examples: 
Adverse events that are uncommon but are known to be strongly associated with IMP exposure.
Adverse events that are not commonly associated wit h IMP exposure, but the event occurs in 
association with other factors strongly suggesting causation, such as a strong temporal 
association or the event recurs on rechallenge.
No reasonable possibility:
There is no reasonable evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship between the IMP and the 
adverse event.
Examples:
Known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation.
Adverse events common in the trial population, which are also anticipated to occur with some 
frequency d uring the course of the trial, regardless of IMP exposure.
Action Taken to IMP
The action taken to the IMP in response to an adverse event must be classified as one of the following:
No change (medication schedule maintained or no action taken)
Withdrawn
Interrupted
Dose reduced
Dose increased

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALOther Action Taken
Adverse events requiring therapy must be treated with recognized standards of medical care to protect 
the health and well -being of the subject. Appropriate resuscitation equipment and medicines mus t be 
available to ensure the best possible treatment of an emergency situation.
If medication is administered to treat the adverse event, this medication should be entered in the 
Concomitant Medication Log .
Date and Time of Outcome
The date the subject recovered or died.
Outcome
The outcome of an adverse event must be classified as one of the following:
Recovered (fully recovered or the condition has returned to the level observed at initiation of 
trial treatment)
Recovered with sequelae (resulted in per sistent or significant disability/incapacity)
Recovering
Not yet recovered
Fatal
8.3 Pregnancy and Pregnancy Outcome
If a pregnancy occurs, the IMP should be immediately stopped and Pharmacovigilance at Ferring 
Pharmaceuticals must be informed and a SAE form completed. The mother and the fetus must be 
followed at least until the birth of the infant and 1 month after the birth of the infant. In general, the 
follow -up will include the course ,duration, and the outcome of the pregnancy ,as well as neonatal 
health. If a pregnancy results in an abnormal outcome (birth defect/congenital anomaly) ,this must be 
reported as an SAE to Pharmacovigilance at Ferring Pharmaceuticals.
In cases in which a fetus may have been exposed through transmission of the IMP via semen following 
paternal exposure and the pregnancy results in an abnormal outcome (birth defect/congenital anomaly) ,
this must be reported as a serious adverse event to Pharmacovigilance at Ferring Pharmaceuticals.

8.4.1 Serious A dverse Event Definition
Serious Adverse Events during the Trial
An event is defined a serious adverse 
event if it:Guidance
results in death Any event resulting in a fatal outcome must be fully documented and reported, including 
deaths occurring within 4 weeks after the treatment ends and irrespective of the causal 
relationship to the IMP. The death of a subject enrolled in a trial is per se not an event, but 
an outcome.
is life-threatening The term life -threatening refers to an adverse event in which the subject was at immediate 
risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which may have caused 
death if it were more severe.
requires in -patient hospitali zation or 
prolongation of existing hospitali zationThe term hospitalization means that the subject was admitted to hospital or that existing 
hospitalization was extended as a result of an event. Hospitalization describes a period of 
at least 24 hours. Over-night stay for observation, stay at emergency room or treatm ent on 
an out -patient basis do not constitute a hospitalization . However, medical judgment must 
alway s be exercised and when in doubt the case should be considered serious (i.e. if case 
fulfills the criterion for a medically important event). Hospitalizati onsfor administrative 
or social purposes do not constitute a serious adverse event ( SAE ). Hospital admissions 
and/or surgical operations planned before trial inclusion are not considered adverse events, 
if the illness or disease existed before the subject was enrolled in the trial, provided that 
the condition did not deteriorate during the trial.
results in persistent or significant 
disability/incapacityDisability/incapacity means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions. In doubt, the decision should be left to medical judgment by the 
investigator.
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect Congenital anomaly /birth defec t observed in any offspring of the subject conceived during 
treatment with the IMP.
is an important medical event Important medical events are events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospitali zation but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples of important 
medical events include adverse events that suggest a significant hazard, contraindication 
or precaution, occurrence of malignancy or development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether events 
qualify as medically important.
Important medical events include any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a 
medicinal product. Any organism virus or infectious particle (e.g. prion protein 
transmitting Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent. A transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected 
from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings indicating an infection in a subject exposed 
to a medicinal product.

Ferrin g will report all adverse events that are serious, unexpected (according to the Investigator 
Brochure) and with a reasonable possible causality to the IMP as judged by either the investigator 
or Ferring to the relevant parties within the stipulated timelin es.  Ferring will submit serious, 
unexpected, causally -related adverse event reports to the US Food and Drug Administration and other 
applicable Health Authorities according to local reporting requirements.  
Serious adverse events will be considered reportable regardless of whether or not the IMP was used in 
accordance with the provisions in the protocol, Investigator’s Brochure and labeling .
8.5 Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
8.5.1 Follow -up of Adverse Events with O nset during the Trial
During the trial, the investigator must follow-up on each adverse event until it is resolved or until the 
medical condition of the subject is stable.
After the subject’s last visit, the investigator must follow
-up on any adverse event classified as serious 
or considered to have a reasonable possible causality to the IMP until it is resolved or until the medical 
condition of the subject is stable. All such relevant follow-up information must be reported to Ferring. 
If the event is a chr onic condition, the investigator and Ferring may agree that further follow -up is not 
required.
8.5.2 Collection of Serious Adverse Events with Onset after Last Trial Visit
If an investigator becomes aware of an SAE after the subject’s last visit and he/she asses ses the SAE to 
have a reasonable possible causality to the IMP, the case will have to be reported to Ferring, regardless 
how long after the end of the trial this takes place.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIAL9 STATISTICAL METHODS
Details of the statistical methodology will be provided in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan. All 
individual subject data will be listed by domain.
9.1 Determination of Sample Size
Based on available literature (Dykens et al 2007), the HPWSQ -R total score at baseline (Visit 2) is
assumed to be normally distributed with a standard deviation of 6.12, and the standard deviation of the 
change between baseline (Visit 2) and Visit 4 is estimated to be between 5 and 6 (11
).  With 30 
subject s eligible for the primary efficacy assessment, the trialhas at least 80% power to detect a 
borderline statistically significant difference (1-sided 10% significance) between 2 groups when the 
true treatment group difference is 
-5 under the standard deviation of 5 to 6 .  Subjects are randomized in 
a 1:1 ratio to either placebo or carbetocin.  
The efficacy of carbetocin will be assessed by change in HPWSQ-R total score from Visit 2 to Visit 4. 
Assuming a dropout rate of approximately 20%, at least 19 subjects per treatment arm will need to be 
randomized to have a total of 30 subjects eligible for the primary efficacy assessment .
9.2 Subject Disposition
The number of subjects randomized into the trialwill be summarized overall. Subjects who discontinue 
IMP or are removed from the trialpermanently will also be reported by the treatment received 
immediately prior to discontinuation . Randomization errors, reasons for trialdiscontinuation, and time 
of withdrawal from the trialwill be reported . No formal statistical analysis will be performed.
9.3 Protocol Deviations
Major or minor protocol deviations will be defined and documented prior to database lock.
9.4 Analysis Sets
9.4.1 Safety Population
All subjects who rece ived at least 1 dose of IMP will be included in the safety population.
9.4.2 Full Analysis Set (FAS) Population
The FAS population will include all subjects in the safety population who have the primary efficacy 
endpoint measured.

variables, and descriptive statistics will be provided for quantitative variables . No formal statistical 
analysis will be performed.
9.5.2 Medical History, Concomitant Medication and Other Safety Evaluations
Medical history obtained at screening will be listed by subject . Physical examination results, including 
nasal exam inations and nasal irritation, will be listed by subject. Concomitant medications will be 
listed by subject.
9.6 Endpoint Assessments
9.6.1 Efficacy Analyses
The primary endpoint will be analyzed in the FAS population using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model with treatment and site as fixed effects and HPWSQ -
R (completed by the
parent/caregiver) total score at Visit 2
(baseli ne)asa
covariate. The last observation carried forward
(LOCF) method will be used to carry forward non -missing values of HPWSQ -R total score during the
phone call assessment (Day 8 ±1) to impute missing values of HPWSQ -R total score at Visit 4. The 
treatm ent group difference in total score between placebo and carbetocin will be calculated by 
subtracting the mean change from baseline in placebo from that in the carbetocin group.  A borderline 
statistically significant difference at the 10% significant level will be achieved if the upper limit of the 
90% 1-sided confidence interval for the treatment difference is less than zero.
The secondary endpoints will be analyzed using a similar model to that of the primary endpoint.
9.7 Extent of Exposure 
The total trialtreatment exposure will be summarized and listed by treatment group for the safety 
population.

Clinical Trial Protocol
Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALWill continue eating if portion size is not limited
Rarely (truly) feels full
Will steal food or money to pay for food
Can eat food from garbage and other unsavory/inedible sources (e.g., dog food, frozen food, 
crayons, etc.)
Typically are not truthful about what they have eaten (i.e. amount and types of food)
Will gain considerable amount of weight over a short period of time if not supervised (e.g., 
some individuals are known to have gained up to 20 pounds in one weekend)
Food typically needs to be locked up. Frequently the child will ask the parent to lock the food if 
the parent has forgotten
Will break i nto neighbors’ houses for food
Temper tantrums and ‘‘meltdowns’’ frequently related to food
Needs to be placed on a diet that is approximately 50–70% of the RDA to maintain a healthy 
weight
Phase 4 Appetite is no longer insatiable (adulthood)
Appetite may still be increased or may be normal or less than normal
Previously in phase 3, but now a noticeable improvement in their appetite control
Can feel full
Appetite can fluctuate in this phase, but the key component is noticeable improvement in 
control of appetite compared to when they were younger
Not as preoccupied with food
Absence of major temper tantrums and ‘‘meltdowns’’ related to food
Onset in adulthood. Could be as early as 20s or as late as 40–50s
Most adults have not gone into this phase and mayb e some (most?) never will

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIAL3 Trial design
3.1 General Design Considerations
This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, multi -center, parallel trial in 
subjects with PWS between 10 and 18 years of age with genetically confirmed diagnosis of PWS 
and a documented nutritional phase 3 bas ed on the criteria defined by Miller et al 2011. The trial 
includes a Screening Period, a 14-day Treatment Period, and a Follow-Up Period. Subjects, along 
with their parent or caregiver, will be required to visit the investigational site 4 times over the 
course of the trial, and participate in 2 phone call assessments.
Visit 1: Screening Period (Day -7 to Day 0)
Visit 2: Baseline 1stday dosing on site (Day 1)
Visit 3:  2ndday dosing on site (Day 2)
Phone call assessment (Day 8)
Visit 4: End -of-Treatment V isit (Day 15)
Follow -up phone call (Day 19 ±3)
Following appropriate informed consent procedures, subjects will undergo screening evaluations to 
determine eligibility before randomization . Screening evaluations include a physical examination , 
vital signs, h eight, weight, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), nasal examination, and laboratory 
assessments -hematology, clinical chemistry, hemostasis, and urinalysis . Approximately 38 
eligible 
male or female subjects will be randomized at Visit 2 to1 of 2 treatment groups for 14 days:
Carbetocin: each spray pump actuation will deliver a 50 µL volume of solution containing 
1.6 mg carbetocin; each dose will consist of 3 spray pump actuations in each nostril to 
deliver a total of 9.6 mg carbetocin
Placebo:  each spray pump actuation will deliver a 50 µL volume of sterile sodium chloride 
solution 0.9%; each dose will consist of 3 spray pump actuations in each nostril
After randomization, efficacy measures and other assessments, including physical examination, 
vital signs, nasal examination, and collection of blood samples for clinical laboratory and 
pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation, will be performed at selected visits according toSchedule of 
Activities in the Protocol . Subjects will be closely monitored for adverse events throughout the trial
following informed consent.
Prior to first dosing at the investigational site, parents/ caregivers will be trained on the proper use 
of the nasal spray device and procedures for Investigational Medicinal Product ( IMP)home 
delivery . Parents/caregivers will be instructed to administer 3 intranasal spray pumps of blinded 
IMP per nostril 3 times daily before meals within the following intervals:

Midday dose:      11: 0
0 a.m. –1:00 p.m.
Evening do se:      4:30 p.m. – 6:00 p.m.
Initial IMP dosing at Visit 2 (Day 1) and Visit 3 (Day 2) will take place under observation of the 
site staff at the investigational site. Subject vital signs will be monitored prior to and after IMP 
dosing at 30 -minute inter vals for 2 hours after each dose. IMP will be shipped by central pharmacy 
directly to the subject’s residence on regular intervals as needed for the duration of the Treatment 
Period.  IMP will be administered by parents/caregivers 3 times per day before me als within the 
above specified dosing intervals. The IMP will require refrigeration during shipment to and during 
storage at the investigational site or subject’s residence until administered.
3.2 Determination of Sample Size
Based on available literature (Dyk
ens et al 2007), the HPWSQ -R total score at baseline (Visit 2) is
assumed to be normally distributed with a standard deviation of 6.12, and the standard deviation of 
the change between baseline (Visit 2) and Visit 4 is estimated to be between 5 and 6. With 30 
subjects eligible for the primary efficacy assessment, the trial has at least 80% power to detect a 
borderline statistically significant difference (1-sided 10% significance) between 2 groups when the 
true treatment group difference is -5 under the standard deviation of 5 to 6 .  Subjects are 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either placebo or carbetocin.  
The efficacy of carbetocin will be assessed by change in HPWSQ
-R total score from Visit 
2/Baseline to Visit 4. Assuming a dropout rate of approximately 20%, at least 19 subjects per 
treatment arm will need to be randomi zed to have a total of 30 subjects eligible for the primary 
efficacy assessment .

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIAL5 Protocol D eviations
Rating of protocol deviations as ‘minor’ and ‘major’ will be decided by the Ferring clinical team on 
the basis of a blinded review of data before declaration of clean file and lock of database. Major 
protocol deviations will lead to exclusion of data from the Per Protocol analyses. Minor pr otocol 
deviations will not lead to exclusion of data from any analyses. 
The full list of major protocol deviations will be detailed and documented in the clean file 
document prior to treatment unblinding. 
Major protocol deviations include, but are not restricted to, the following: 
Violation of inclusion or exclusion criteria that may affect the efficacy analysis such as:
oInclusion criterion 4, genetically confirmed diagnosis of PWS
oInclusion criterion 5, Nutritional phase 3 PWS criteria based on Miller et al, 2011; 
oInclusion criterion 6, HPWSQ -R score greater than 13 at screening, Visit 1
oExclusion criterion 5, Prior or concomitant use of a selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitor (SS RI) or selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), antipsychotic 
medication, wakefulness -promoting drug, or thyroid hormone that does not comply 
with the criteria in Section 4.3.1 of the Protocol; 
oExclusion criterion 6, Use of any of the prohibite d medications or therapies listed in 
Section 4.3.2 of Protocol 
Actual treatment not in accordance with randomized treatment.
Less 80% compliance with treatment and/or missing more than 4 consecutive doses
HPWSQ -R assessment not completed on Day 15

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIAL9 Efficacy
9.1 General Considerations
Efficacy analysis will be conducted for the FAS population unless otherwise specified . All 
statistical tests will be performed using a one-sided test at a 10% significance level. No adjustments 
will be made for multiple tests. Baseline for all efficacy analyses will be the values obtained at the 
last assessment prior to the first dose of IMP.
Handling of missing scores of questionnaire
A subscore or domain score of the HPWSQ -R questionnaire is defined as the sum of all items 
scores in the domain. The average value of completed items in a domain will be used an estimate of 
missing items. If more than 50 percent of the items from a domain are missing, the corresponding 
domain score will be set to missing. Total score is the sum of these three subscores. Total score will 
be missing if any subscore is missing.
The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method will be used to carry forward no n-missing 
values of HPWSQ-
R total score during the phone call assessment (Day 8±1) to impute missing 
values of HPWSQ-R total score at Visit 4 (i.e. exactly on Day 15). Any assessments not within the 
window Day 8±1 and prior to Day 15 will not be used for L OCF imputation.  For subjects who 
discontinued IMP prior to Day 12, if they have HPWSQ -Rassessments on Day 15, then the 
assessment s are considered invalid for primary endpoint analysis. LOCF values at Day 15 will be 
populated with non- missing values of HP WSQ-R total score during the phone call assessment (Day 
8±1).
Similarly, HPWSQ-R-C will be handled in the same way as HPWSQ- R. The analyses of HPWSQ -
R and HPWSQ -R-C will be conducted based on LOCF values unless otherwise specified.
No imputation will be applied to the domain score of HPWSQ -RandHPWSQ - R-C, and other 
questionnaires ( Clinical Global Impression , CY -BOCS and Food Domain of the Reiss Profile). 
9.2 Primary Endpoint(s)
The Hyperphagia in Prader- Willi Syndrome questionnaire (HPWSQ -R) is an informant -based tool 
for examining the psychological, developmental, and neurobiological correlates of hyperphagia in 
PWS.The items measure hyperphagic symptoms are reported by caregivers and are rated on a five-
point scale (1: not at all/none of the tim/ extremely easy to 5: extremely/all of the time/extremely 
hard). HPWSQ-R Questionnaire is classified into 3 domains; behavior, drive ,and severity.
Subdomain Question
Hyperphagic Behavior 1d. How “clever” or “fast” was your child in obtaining food?
2a. Try to bargain or manipulate to get more food
2b. Forage through the trash for food

Hyperphagic Drive 1a. How upset did your child generally become when denied a desired food?
1b. How persistent was your child in asking or looking for food after being told 
      “no” or “no more”?
1c. How distressed did your child become when stopped from talking about 
      food or engaging in food -related behaviors?
3. Once food on mind, how easy to redirect away from food
Hyperphagic Severity 1e. To what exten tdid food -related thoughts, talk, or behaviour interfere with 
      your child’s normal daily routines, self -care, school, or work                                                                                                                              
2d. Talk about food or engaged in food -related behaviors, outside of normal 
      meal times
The subscore for a domain is defined as the sum of all item scores in the domain. T otal s core is the 
sum of these three subscores. Total score will be missing if any subscore is missing. Missing item 
scores and total score will be handled as described in the section 9.1.
9.2.1 Primary Variable(s) Analysis
The primary variable is change in HP WSQ- R total score from baseline to Visit 4 (Day 15) and will 
be analyzed in the FAS population using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with 
treatment and site as fixed effects and HPWSQ- R total score at baseline asacovariate. The 
treatment group difference in total score between placebo and carbetocin will be calculated by 
subtracting the mean change from baseline in placebo from that in the carbetocin group.  A 
borderline statistically significant difference at the 10% significant level will be achieved if the 
upper limit o f the 90% 1-sided confidence interval (CI) for the treatment difference is less than 
zero. The corresponding p -value will be reported as well.
Summary of HP WSQ
-R total score will be presented as well as a box- and-whisker plot of change in 
HPWSQ- R total score by visit.
9.2.2 Sensitivity Analyses 
The analysis of the primary endpoint in the section 9.2.1 will be also conducted based on the 
subjects in the PPpopulation and ITT population .
In addition, the primary endpoint will be analyzed using repeated measures analys is with treatment, 
site, visit and treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed effects and HPWSQ -R total score at baseline as
acovariate. An unstructured working correlation matrix will be used for the analysis. LOCF will 
not be used to impute missing values because it would affect the correlation of observations 
between weeks. The two treatment groups will be compared at Visit 4 (Day 15). The LS means, the 
LS mean difference, and 90% 1-sided confidence interval ( CI) for the treatment difference will be 
presented will be presented at each visit as well.

Secondary endpoints include C linical Global Impression -Improvement after treatment (CGI- I) 
score at Day 8 and Visit 4, c hange from Visit 2/Ba seline to Day 8 and Visit 4 for the following 
measurements:
HPWSQ -R hyperphagia behavior, drive, and severity domain scores
HPWSQ -R-C total score
HPWSQ -R-C hyperphagia behavior, drive, and severity domain scores
and c hange from Visit 1/Baseline to Day 8 and Visit 4 for the following measurements:
CY-BOCS total score
Food Domain of the Reiss Profile
The improvement of PWS symptoms will be assessed by the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) .The 
CGI scale 
isa 7-point clinician rating of illness severity ( 1 = no illness, 7 = extremely ill), at the 
beginning of the trial and a 7- point clinician rating of improvement of patient condition (1 =very 
much i mproved, 7 = very much w orse), during and at the end of the trial.
HPWSQ -
R-C scale consists of the same 11 questions and has the same scoring as HPWSQ- R. 
HPWSQ -R-C is administered by the same clinician throughout the trial while t he HPWSQ -Rscale 
is administered by the parent or caregiver.
The CY- BOCS is a clinician rated, semi- structured inventory of specific symptoms and symptom 
severity (0 =none, 4 =extreme) in pediatric obsessive -compulsive disorder ( OCD). It includes 2
primary components: the Symptom Checklists and Severity Scale. The 10severity items are 
summed to produce an Obsessions Severity Score (5 items), Compulsions Severity Score (5 items), 
and Total score (sum of all 10 severity it ems). 
The food domain of the Reiss Profile consists of 7 questions that pertain to food seeking behaviour. 
For analysis purpose, the scales of Food Domain of the Reiss Profile will be scores as follows:
Scales of Food Domain of the Reiss Profile Score
Strongly Disagree -2
Disagree -1
Neutral 0
Agree 1
Strongly Agree 2
Total score of Food Domain of the Reiss Profile is defined as the sum of all individual item scores.
The secondary endpoints will be analyzed in a similar fashion as the primary endpoint. All analysis 
of secondary endpoints will be conducted using ANCOVA model treatment and site as fixed effects

10.1 General Considerations
Safety parameters will be evaluated for the safety analysis set.Complete listings and summary 
tables for all safety information, including adverse events, clinical laboratory safety data, physical 
examination , nasal examination, vital signs, and ECG will be presented.  No formal statistical 
analysis will be performed.
Unscheduled assessments prior to the first IMP administration will be included to derive baseline 
while post -baseline unscheduled assessments will not be included in the data analysis unless 
specified .
10.2 Adverse E vents
Adverse events (AEs) are classified according to the MedDRA version 16.1 give a system org an 
class and preferred term for each event.
A treatment- emergent adverse event (TEAE) is any adverse event that begins during the treatment 
period or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition. The Trea tment Period is the period during 
which a subject receives IMP ( including the residual time of drug effect
). More specially, for 
subjects who completing all doses as planned on Day 14, t he Treatment Period is Day 1 to Day 15. 
For subjects who discontinued IMP, the Treatment Period is Day 1 to the dose date + 1.
TEAEs will be listed by treatment and subject, and the incidence of TEAE s will be presented by 
treatment . 
In addition, TEAEs will be presented by causality (relationship to the trialmedication) 
and intensity (severity) and seriousness. Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
and adverse events leading 
to discontinuation will be listed.
If a subject has an AE with unknown intensity, then the subject is counted in the category of 
“Severe”. If an AE with unknown relationship to IMP , then the AE is considered to be related to 
IMP.
10.2.1 Overview of Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events
ATEAE overview summary table will be prepared including the number of subjects reporting a
TEAE, the pe rcentage of subjects (%) with a TEAE,and the number of events (E) reported, for the 
following categories:

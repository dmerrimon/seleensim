operative and Immediate Post- operative Period (T -NOX)  
 
Background:  
Infants who undergo cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) are at significant risk of 
morbidity and mortality associated with end-organ injury and dysfunction.  The etiology for end-organ 
injury and dysfunction after heart surgery is multi- factorial  and likely  related to intraoperative techniques , 
residual cardiac lesions, a systemic inflammatory response, and several patient -specific factors such as age, 
weight, level of preoperative support, genetic abnormalities, cardiac diagnosis and type of surgi cal 
procedure.  Not surprisingly, there is wide institutional variation in outcomes after cardiac surgery in infants 
and young children.   
During open heart surgery with CPB, t he myocardium is  exposed to a period of ischemia and 
reperfusion , which is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidant stress.  Despite the well-
described role of oxidant stress in ischemia-reperfusion injury, the current practice at many centers is to 
administer supra -physiologic oxygen levels (hyperoxia) to infants t hrough the cardiopulmonary bypass 
circuit and mechanical ventilator , which could theoretically exacerbat e oxidant stress and reperfusion 
injury.  These detrimental effects of hyperoxia may be more pronounced in neonates and infants who are 
known to have immature anti -oxidant defenses compared to older children and adults [1], and further 
influenced by preoperative cyanosis. 
There is  mounting experimental evidence and several clinical studies that support the concept that 
hyperoxia (versus normoxia) is asso ciated with adverse outcomes after ischemia.  Animal models of CPB  
and cardioplegic arrest show that hyperoxic myocardial rep erfus ion is associated with increased oxidant 
stress, inflammation, and organ injury com pared with normoxic reperfusion[2] .  Furthermore, hyperoxia 
during and after cardiopulmonary resuscitation has been associated with an increased risk of mortal ity in 
both children and adults [3-6].  Lastly, in pediatric patients requiring  veno -arterial extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation, hyperoxia was associated with worse clinical ou tcomes[7, 8]. 
2 
ProtocolVersion: 1.4 
Date: 03122021 There are a few comparative trials of hyperoxic versus controlled normoxic reperfusion following 
CPB in adults and children with mixed results.  In two adult  studies , there were no observed clinical 
differences between the different r eperfusion strategies [9, 10], however Ihnken and colleagues showed a 
significant increase in pulmonary function and evidence for decreased oxidant stress biomarkers in patients 
exposed to normoxia compared to hyperoxia  [11] .   In older children undergoing cardiac surgery, exposure 
to lower oxygen levels  during cardiopulmonary bypass produced a significant reduction in  oxidant stress 
biomarkers [12-14] , biomarkers of brain injury [13, 15] , and length of mechanical ventilation  [14, 16].  In 
single ventricle patients, n ormoxi c reperfusion during CPB  also i mproved long -term survival, systemic 
ventricular  function, and heart failure classification  [17].  A summary of the studies in adults and children  
is shown in Table 1.

Date: 03122021 Overall, pediatric clinical and pre -clinical experimental studies suggest that  there is a likely benefit 
to normoxi c and controlled re-oxygenation during cardiac surgery .  However, there are several limitations 
to the published data including single center studies  enrolling a wide age range, heterogeneous patient 
populations encompassing a wide variety of cardiac diagnoses and surgical procedures, and an inconsistent 
approach to preventing early exposure to supra -physiologic oxygen levels.  Furthermore, results from an  
informal survey of other large pediatric cardiac surgery centers (Table 2)  and survey data from 39 centers 
from a large multi -institutional registry (NPC- QIC) (Figure 1) indicates that most centers utilize a supra-
physiologic oxygen management strategy and that there is significant practice variation with regards to goal 
oxygen levels during cardiopulmonary bypas s.  Therefore, the goal of this proposed study is to investigate 
the use of normoxia  or near -physiologic oxygen levels  before,  during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass in 
a well-defined, high-risk cyanotic neonatal population undergoing a select number of surgeries .  The study 
will be a pilot single center study to show efficacy and safety with the eventual goal of a larger multi -center 
study that will be powered to show a true difference in clinical outcom es.

Specific Aims:   
1. To assess oxidative stress and end organ injury in the normoxia versus supra-physiologic oxygen groups.  
Hypothesis 1a :  Normoxia will be associated with reduced oxidative stress as measured by 
thiobarbitur ic acid reactive substances (TBARS), a marker of lipid peroxidation. We also anticipate 
reductions in other measures including protein carbonyl, 8-isoprostane, and whole blood reduction-
oxidation potential. 
Hypothesis 1b: End organ injury will be reduced as assessed by biomarkers of renal (Neutrophil 
gelatinase -associated lipocalin), neurologic ( Glial fibrillary acidic protein,  Tau), liver (Intestinal fatty -
acid binding protein), vascular ( Angiopoietin 2) , and myocardial injury (Troponin I) as well as 
immune system activation (IL -6, IL -10). 
2. To evaluate the safety profile of a strategy of normoxia versus supra-physiologic oxygen. 
Hypothesis:  Observed major adverse events including in- hospital mortality, cardiac arrest, need for 
mechanical circulatory support, seizures, and dialysis will be similar or lower in the normoxia group.   
 
3. To investigate optimal endpoints in the study of the clinical impact of normoxia.  

7 
ProtocolVersion: 1.4 
Date: 03122021 We will assess clinical endpoints that may be reflective of a reduction in oxidative stress to understand 
effect sizes and inform the design of subsequent trials. These endpoints will include post- operative 
length of stay, days alive and out of the intensive care unit (ICU) at 30 days after surgery, a composite outcome of major adverse events as described above, and a global rank score. 
 
Study Design:  
 Participants:  
Single center (University of Michigan) randomized pilot study  in infants less than 30 days of age 
undergoing heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass . The trial will be unblinded with respect to 
knowledge of treatment assignment as the majority of clinical personnel will have knowledge of the 
cardiopulmonary bypass strategy based on blood gases and operative documents. 
Inclusion Criteria:   
• Age less than 30 days of age at time of surgery with need for cardiopulmonary bypass  with 
cardioplegic arrest (with or without deep hypothermic circulatory arrest)  
• Diagnosis with cyanosis at baseline (pre-operative PaO2 of less than 50mmHG) due to: 
o Complete admixture lesion (example: hypoplastic left heart syndrome, total anomalous 
pulmonary venous return, truncus arteriosus, pulmonary atresia with VSD ) 
o Transposition physiology (example: D -Transposition of the great arteries  or Double 
outlet right ventricle with subpulmonary VSD) 
o Right -to-left shunt (example: Tetralogy of Fallot, double outlet right ventricle with 
suboaortic VSD and pulmonary stenosis) 
 
Exclusion Criteria: 
• Corrected gestation at tim e of surgery less than 37 weeks  
• Prior cardiac arrest  
• Current or prior history of ECMO support 
• Current or prior history of  needing renal replacement therapy with  dialysis  
• Prior cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass 
• Diagnosis of Ebstein’s Anomaly  
• Known genetic syndrome other than Trisomy 21 or DiGeorge Syndrome 
8 
ProtocolVersion: 1.4 
Date: 03122021 Subject Availability:  
Based on historical data, the number of patients that fit the inclusion criteria would be about 40- 50 patients 
per year in this single center study. A sample size of 21 patients per treatment group (42 total patients) will 
be enrolled . With a 50-67% consent rate, the study duration w ill be approximately 24 months. 
 Trial Enrollment and Randomization:  
 
Infants will be randomized into two groups: 
1. Normoxia Group (with controlled re-oxygenation): 
a. Goal PaO2 on cardiopulmonary bypass of 60-100 mm Hg using lower FiO2 (blended 
sweep gas)  via oxygenator  
b. Post-bypass, goal of PaO2 <100 mm Hg by anesthesia and in ICU via oxygen titration via 
mechanical ventilator  for 24 hours post-op. 
2. Standard of Care Group:  Current standard of care  
 
Randomization will be performed in random permuted bloc k sizes of 2 or  4 and stratified by “Stage I 
Palliation” (Norwood arch reconstruction with shunt placement [Right ventricle -to-pulmonary artery shunt, 
modified Blalock -Taussig shunt, or central aortopulmonary shunt ]) in each treatment group .  Patients 
undergoing Stage I palliation are known to have higher rates of complications and mortality at baseline and 
therefore the stratifi cation will be done to control for this in the randomization.  
 
Study Protocol:  
Please see Figure 2 for a summary of the study protocol.  
1. Preoperative : 
Patients that meet the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria will be identified and the families will be 
approached for consent prior to the scheduled surgery.   
Patients that are enrolled in the study will have the following pre- operative studies:  
9 
ProtocolVersion: 1.4 
Date: 03122021 • Head  ultrasound  (not currently standard of care but will be used to evaluate for any brain injury 
in each group) 
• Renal function and liver function panel ( within 24 hours prior to surgery) 
 
2. Operating Room: 
Patients will be brought to the operating room in a standard fashion.  Anesthesia will induce general 
anesthesia per protocol and secure an airway (if needed) and place invasive lines.  Patients will have labs drawn (baseline biomarkers of oxidative stress, troponin level, and Redox potential) and an arterial blood 
gas.   
All p atients will have a median sternotomy and be cannulated onto cardiopulmonary bypass via standard 
procedures at the discretion of the surgery team.    
3. Initiation of Cardiopulmonary Bypass: 
 The cardiopulmonary bypass circuits will be set up and prime d per standard institutional protocols.   
“Normoxia ” Group:  Prior to cannulation, a blood gas will be drawn from the cardiopulmonary bypass 
circuit  and correlated to the CDI (in -line PaO2 monitor).  The FiO 2 of the oxygenator will then be titrated 
to achieve a PaO 2 of the circuit and CDI of 60- 100 mm Hg.  After cannulation, frequent blood gases will 
be checked per protocol and correlated with the CDI to maintain a PaO 2 of 60-100 mm Hg. 
“Standard of Care ” Group:  After cannulation, frequent blood gases will be checked per protocol on bypass 
and correlated with the CDI to maintain a PaO 2 of 200-300 per standard practice. 
 
4. Weaning  of Cardiopulmonary Bypass: 
At the end of re-warming, a blood sample will be obtained fo r appropriate studies.  
“Normoxia ” Group:  As cardiopulmonary bypass is being weaned, anesthesia will initiate mechanical 
ventilation with an FiO2 of 50% or less (unless clinically necessary) to achieve oxygen saturation and PaO 2 
goals that fit within the e xpected range for the patient’s physiology: 
1. Single ventricle patients (PaO 2:35-45 and oxygen saturation 75%-85%) 
2. Two ventricle patients (PaO 2: 60-100 and oxygen saturation >92%) 
10 
ProtocolVersion: 1.4 
Date: 03122021 Measures of oxygen delivery such as NIRS monitoring, mixed venous oxygen saturations, and 
lactate measurements will be used to verify appropriate oxygen delivery.  
 
“Standard of Care” Group:  As cardiopulmonary bypass is being weaned, anesthesia will initiate mechanical 
ventilation per standard protocols.  Ventilation will be co ntinued in the ICU and adjusted per standard goals 
per the intensivist .   
 
5. Post-Operative Course:  
After transfer to the PCTU from the OR, the goals as stated above based on the patient’s physiology will 
be maintained for 24 hours after the surgery per the goals per group and physiology. 
After cardiac surgery, the following tests and evaluation will be performed: 
1.  At 2, 6, and 24 hours after surgery (time marked as decannulation from cardiopulmonary bypass):  biomarkers for oxidative stress, inflammation, vascular injury, neurologic, myocardial, and renal injury will be drawn.  
2. At 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery: renal function and liver function panels will be obtained 
3. A head ultrasound will be performed at 24 and 72 hours after surgery 
4. EEG monitoring may  be connected to each infant after arrival to the ICU as part of the standard 
of care.   
6. Adverse Event Assessment  
Assessment of Seri ous Adverse Events will be perf ormed 1month post surgery. A chart review will be 
performed by the study team. If a chart revi ew can’t be accomplished, the study team will contact the patient 
via phone call for an assessment. See Serious Adverse Event section of the protocol for specific definitions.

Outcomes  and Analysis : 
Analysis will be performed on the basis of the intent -to-treat principle.  Baseline characteristics will be 
compared between the treatment groups using standard univariate tests.  
Spec ific Aim 1:  The primary outcome for this aim will be systemic oxidative stress based on  thiobarbituric 
acid reactive substances (TBARS), a measurement of lipid peroxidation, assessed at three separate time 
points in the first 24 hours after surgery. An analysis of co -variance will be used incorporating all available 
data to model the outcome  with an adjustment for pre -operative baseline (although we anticipate no 
differences in baseline values by treatment arm due to randomization). The model will compare the mean values (and 95% confidence intervals) between the two groups at each time -point .  In this model, we will 
assume missing data are missing at random, i.e., missing values may depend on observed but not 
unobserved data.  Analysis will be performed on the basis of the intent- to-treat principle  and will include 
an interim analysis after 2 4 patients are enrolled.   In secondary analyses, we will use propensity scores to 

12 
ProtocolVersion: 1.4 
Date: 03122021 account for any characteristics that were not balanced by treatment arm after randomization. We plan to 
analyze other biomarkers of oxidative stress and organ injury using analogous analysis of variance models.   
Spec ific Aim 2:  To evaluate safety, we will assess the rate of observed adverse events between groups using 
Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. Safety will also closely be monitored on a routine bas is 
by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). .   
Spec ific Aim 3:  To investigate optimal endpoints in the study of the cli nical impact of normoxia. We will 
assess clinical endpoints that may be reflective of a reduction in oxidative stress, including post- operative 
length of stay, days alive and out of the intensive care unit (ICU) at 30 days after surgery, a composite 
outcome of major adverse events as described above, and a global rank score. For all endpoints, data on distribution within our study population and between the two groups will be calculated to understand effect 
sizes and aid i n planning subsequent studies.  
1. Post-operative length of stay: Calculated as number of days in the hospital after surgery. May be an 
attractive outcome as it can  incorporate many of the morbidities that would be influenced by strategies to 
reduce oxidative stress as most would lead to prolonged length of stay. The disadvantages are that it does not incorporate mortality, and may be influenced by other center care processes and practices.  
2. Days alive and out of the ICU or hospital at 30 days after surgery: This endpoint has been used to measure 
outcomes in other adult trials and a limited number of pediatric trials .  It can incorporate both mortality and 
various m orbidities that may be influenced by strategies to reduce oxidative stress as most significant 
complications or end- organ injury can extend stay in the ICU or hospital. As a continuous variable, it is 
also statistically expedient allowing for smaller sample sizes to detect significant differences in treatment 
groups. 
3. Composite outcome: A composite endpoint can combine multiple relevant morbidities or adverse events 
such as those described above. Disadvantages are that all are inherently assumed to be of equal severity.  
13 
ProtocolVersion: 1.4 
Date: 03122021 4. Global rank score: The rank score has the advantage of allowing for the combination of various endpoints 
into a single quantifiable endpoint like a composite outcome, however also allows weighting of the severity 
of the component endpoints, as opposed to a  traditional composite endpoint where all endpoints are treated 
equally. It has been utilized increasingly in other trial settings . In this study, scores will be calculated based 
on a pre- specified ranking of outcomes:  mortality, cardiac arrest, ECMO, seizures, and dialysis. We will 
also explore the inclusion of other clinical endpoints in both the global rank score and composite outcome, 
as well as different ranking strategies.   
Other secondary exploratory outcomes of general morbidity and end- organ dysf unction will be 
measured and compared between the two treatment groups .  Please see Table 3 for a description of the 
biomarkers and other tests that will be collected or performed.

Description of Risks/Benefits and Monitoring Strategy  
Benefits:  
The possible benefits of the study will be that the patient’s family and care team will receive extra 
information regarding their cardiovascular and health status.  The evaluation of organ function and injury after surgery may provide valuable information to the family and the clinical team that would not otherwise 
be available, and this may lead to early intervention if abnormalities are detected.  Although an individual patient may not directly benefit from the study participation, the results will help t o further the 
understanding of oxidative stress and organ injury after cardiopulmonary bypass and will hopefully allow 
for further future studies that enroll a larger number of patients.   
If parents decline to participate, their child’s medical care will not be affected in any way.  Furthermore, if 
they agree to participate, they are free to withdraw at any time.  
Risks:  
 Definition of Serious Adverse Event:  
An extensive review of the literature and survey results from other centers with cardiopulmonary bypass 
strategies similar to what is proposed indicate that there is a low probability of additional risk to the patients.  In this trial, due to the risks of cardiac surgery itself, assessment of relationship of the intervention to any 
adverse event is chall enging.  
Consistent with standard clinical trials practice, a Serious Adverse Event is defined generally as any event 
that:  
17 
ProtocolVersion: 1.4 
Date: 03122021 (a) Is fatal; or  
(b) Is life -threatening (the subject was, in the view of the Principal Investigator, in immediate danger of 
death from the event as it occurred); or  
(c) Is severely or permanently disabling; or 
(d) Necessitates significant intervention, such as major surgery, to prevent permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure; or (e) Necessitates or prolongs hospital admission; or 
(f) The Principal Investigator, medical monitor, or DSMB considers a serious adverse event.  
Because many normal post -operative outcomes in this study would meet these criteria, only the following 
six events have been identified as specific Serious Adverse Events for the purposes of this study:  
(a) Death  
(b) Cardiac arrest requiring CPR and medications  
(c) Cardiopulmonary insufficiency requiring ECMO 
(d) Seizures  
(e) Need for dialysis  
In addition, any other event that in the opinion of the  study investigator is considered to be a Serious 
Adverse Event may be classified as such and will then adhere to the rules for expedited reported.  
If a clinical event or finding does not meet the definition of “serious” per above, these non - serious event s 
will be classified and will be reported as a complication rather than as a serious adverse event.  
 Classification of Serious Adverse Event  
All Serious Adverse Events will be classified based on whether the event was expected, the relationship to 
the intervention, and the clinical outcome.  Specific definitions and classifications are described below. 
18 
ProtocolVersion: 1.4 
Date: 03122021  
All Serious Adverse Events will be evaluated as to whether their occurrence was expected or whether it 
was not expected to occur.  
A).  “Expected”: An event is considered expected if it is known to be associated with the underlying 
cardiovascular anomaly or with congenital heart surgery, and is mentioned in the protocol, informed consent, or other study documents. An event may be expected despite the study subject’s 
clinical state immediately prior to the event. For this protocol, expected events include:  
(a)  Sudden cardiac death  
(b)  Arrhythmias  (c)  Tamponade  
(d)  Postoperative bleeding  (e)  Postoperative open chest  (f)  Postoperative chest re -exploration  
(g)  Postoperative electrolyte abnormalities  
(h)  Postoperative fever  
(i)  Postoperative renal dysfunction  (j)  Postoperative liver dysfunction  (k)  Shunt thrombosis  (l)  Aortic coarctation with or without associated ventricular dysfunction  
(m)  Ventricular dysfunction not associated with coarctation  
19 
ProtocolVersion: 1.4 
Date: 03122021 (n)  Pericardial effusion  
(o)  Wound infection  
(p)  Reintubation after extubation following surgery  
(q)  Hypoxia  
(r)  Respiratory distress  
(s)  Pleural effusions  
(t)  Seizures  
(u)  Renal dysfunction associated with ventricular dysfunction  (v)  Liver dysfunction associated with ventricular dysfunction   
B).  “Unexpected”. An event is considered unexpected if there are no prior data linking this 
event with either the condition or intervention under study. 
 
In terms of relation to the intervention, the Serious Adverse Event will be classified as:  
a)  definitely related to the intervention  
b) probably related to the intervention 
c) possibly related to the intervention  
d) unlikely to be related  to the intervention  
e) definitely not related to the intervention  
 
The clinical outcome of the Serious Adverse Event will be characterized as follows:  
20 
ProtocolVersion: 1.4 
Date: 03122021 (a) Death  
(b) Recovered: the patient returned to baseline status 
(c) Symptoms continue  
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board will be established. The DSMB will meet 4 times a year to review 
study conduct, adverse events, and any interim data.  
After each DSMB meeting, a Summary Report of Adverse Events will be prepared within 30 days and will 
be distributed to the Principal Investigator with instructions that the Principal Investigator forward the 
Summary Report to the IRB. The Summary Report wi ll contain the following information:  
• A statement that a DSMB review of outcome data, adverse events, and information relating to study 
performance took place on a given date  
• A statement as to whether or not the frequency of adverse events exceeded what was expected and 
indicated in the informed consent  
• A statement that a review of recent literature relevant to the research took place  
• The DSMB’s recommendation with respect to progress or need for modification of the protocol or 
informed consent. If the DSMB recommends changes to the protocols or informed consent, the 
rationale for such changes and any relevant data will be provided  
Reporting of Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events  
Reports of Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events will be submitted to the local Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) per institutional guidelines . The PI will report any serious adverse event to the DSMB Chair 
as soon as possible and no later than 7 calendar days after the event.  
21 
ProtocolVersion: 1.4 
Date: 03122021 All events/complications and all events reported as serious adverse events will be tabulated and reviewed 
by the DSMB at their regularly -scheduled meetings, at least 4 times per year.  
Data Collection Procedures for Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events  
 
1.  The five events specified as Serious Adverse Events are to be reported in an expedited fashion. Any other event that in the opinion of the study investigator is considered to meet the definition of a Serious Adverse Event should also be reported in an expedited fashion.  
Significant peri- operative and other in- hospital adverse events will be collected and be reported as 
“complications” versus adverse events.  
2. Any medical condition or abnormal laboratory value present at enrollment that remains unchanged or 
improves will not be reported as a serious adverse event or complication. However, worsening of a medical condition that was present at enrollment will be considered a new event and reported according to the plan 
outlined above.  
3. The onset of an event/complication will be recorded according to the date of the first presenting symptom.  
4. Serious adverse events will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator and the DSMB.

 STUDY SYNOPSIS  
Title: A Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled, sequential parallel 
comparison design (SPCD) study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of AVP -786 (deuterated 
[d6]-dextromethorphan hydrobromide  [d6-DM] /quinidine sulfate  [Q]) for the treatment of agitation in 
patients with dementia of the Alzheimer’s type.  
Study Objectives  
The objectives of the study are to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of AVP-786 compared to 
placebo, for the treatment of agitation in patients with dementia of  the Alzheimer’s type.   
Study Population  
Number of Patients :  Approximately 380 patients will be enrolled at approximately 60 centers in North 
America. 
Condition/Disease :  Patients  with agitation secondary to dementia of the Alzheimer’s type.  The diagnosis 
of probable Alzheimer’s disease will be based on  the ‘2011 Diagnostic Guidelines for Alzheimer’s 
Disease’ issued by the National  Institute on Aging (NIA) -Alzheimer’s Association (AA) workgroups.1  
Diagnosis of agitation will be based on t he provisional consensus definition of agitation in patients with 
cognitive disorders  developed by the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) Agitation  Definition 
Work Group.2   
Key Inclusion Criteria :  Patie nts with clinically significant, moderate/severe agitation at the time of 
screening and for at least 2 week s prior to randomization, that interferes with daily routine and for which 
a prescription medication is indicated in the opinion of the investigator.  A Clinical Global Impression of 
Severity of Illness scale for Agitation (CGI S-Agitation ) score of ≥ 4 (moderately ill) at screening and 
baseline is required for study participation.  Eligible patients must have a reliable caregiver who is able 
and willing to comply with study procedures, including not administering any prohibited medications 
during the course of the study .   
Key Exclusion Criteria:  Patients with dementia predominantly of the non -Alzheimer’s type (e.g., 
vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson’s disease, substance-induced de mentia) and 
patients with symptoms of agitation t hat are not secondary to Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., secondary to 
pain, other psychiatric disorder or delirium)  are not eligible . 
A complete list of inclusion/exclusion criteria is presented in Section 4 of the study protocol.  
Study Design  
Structure:  This is a  phase 3 , multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled , SPCD  study  
comprising 2 stages.  A schematic of the study design is presented in  Figure 1. 
Duration: Patients will be enrolled in the study for a pproximately 16 weeks; with up to 4-week screening 
period and 12-week treatment period.   The treatment period is divided equally into 2 stages of 6 weeks 
each, Stage 1 and Stage 2 .

 Study Treatment:  The investigational product  is AVP -786 (deuterated  [d6]-dextromethorphan 
hydrobromide  [d6-DM ; INN:deudextromethorphan ]/quinidine sulfate  [Q]).  Two doses of AVP -786 will 
be evaluated ; d6-DM  28 mg/Q 4.9 mg and d6-DM 18 mg/Q 4.9 mg, hereafter referred to as AVP -786-
28/4.9 and AVP -786-18/4.9, respectively.  
Control :  Placebo  capsules of identical appearance to study medication  will be used as control. 
Randomization/Stratification :  Eligible patients will be rand omized into the study in a  
(active:active:placebo) ratio to receive either AVP -786-28/4.9 capsules, AVP -786-18/4.9 capsules, or 
matching placebo capsules in Stage 1.  The randomization will be stratified by  the Neuropsychiatric 
Inventory  (NPI) Agitation/Aggression domain score (≤  6 vs. >  6), risk assessment for falls  (norm al/mild  
vs. moderate/severe), and concomitant use of antipsychotic medications (yes vs. n o).    
Dose Regimen : Eligible patients  will be randomly assigned at the Baseline visit to receive AVP -786 or 
matching placebo capsules.  Study medication will be admin istered orally twice daily (BID, 1 capsule in 
the morning and 1 capsule in the evening approximately 12 hours apart)  throughout the study.  
Stage 1  
• Patients randomized to receive AVP -786-28/4.9 will start with AVP -786-18/4.9 once a day in the 
morning and placebo in the evening for the first 7  days of the study .  From Day 8, patients will 
receive AVP -786-18/4.9 BID for 14 days.  From Day 22, patients will receive AVP -786-28/4.9 BID 
for the  remaining 3-week duration of Stage 1 .  
• Patients randomized to receive AVP -786-18/4.9 will start with AVP -786-18/4.9 once a day in the 
morning and placebo in the evening for the first 7 days of the study.  From Day 8, patients will 
receive AVP -786-18/4.9 BID for the remaining 5-week duration of Stage 1 . 
• Patients randomized to receive placebo will be dosed with placebo BID during Stage 1.  
Stage 2:  
Patients  who complete Stage 1 are eligible to participate in Stage 2 of the study.  In Stage 2, patients will 
be assigned to study  treatment as follows:  
• Patients who received AVP-786 in Stage 1 will continue to receive the same dose of AVP -786 BID 
(either AVP -786-18/4.9 or AVP -786-28/4.9 ) for the entire 6 -week duration of Stage  2. 
• Patients who received placebo in Stage 1 will be further stratified into two sub -groups (“responders” 
and “non-responders”) on Visit 4 (Day 43) based on their treatment response.  Patients will be 
consi dered “responders” if their CGIS- Agitation score is ≤ 3 at Visit 4 ( Day 43) and their NPI  
Agitation/Aggression d omain score has decreased by ≥ 25% from baseline.   Patients who do not meet 
these criteria will be considered “non -responders”.  Patients within e ach placebo sub-group will be re -
randomized in a   (active:active:placebo) ratio to receive either AVP -786-18/4.9, AVP -786-
28/4.9 capsules, or matching placebo capsules. 
o Patients who are re-randomized to placebo will continue to receive placebo BID for the entire 
6-week duration of Stage 2.

 o Patients who are re- randomized to AVP -786-28/4.9 will receive AVP -786-18/4.9 once a day 
in the morning and placebo in the evening for the first 7 days of St age 2 (Days 43 -49).  From 
Day 50, patients will receive AVP -786- 18/4.9 BID for 14 days (Days 50 -63).  From Day 64, 
patients will receive AVP -786-28/4.9 BID for the remaining 3 weeks of the study.  
o Patients who are re- randomized to AVP -786-18/4.9 will receive AVP -786-18/4.9 once a day 
in the morning and placebo in the evening for the f irst 7 days of Stage 2 (Days 43 -49).  From 
Day 50, patients will receive AVP -786-18/4.9 BID for the remaining 5  weeks of the study.  
Assessments and Visits  
Patients  will attend clinic visits at Screening, Baseline (Day 1), and on Days 8 (Week 1), 15 (Week  2), 
22 (Week 3), 43 (Week  6), 64 (Week 9 ), and 85 (Week 12).  Safety follow -up phone calls will  be made 
on Days 29  (Week 4) and 71 (Week 10).  Study procedures will be performed at each visit as outlined in 
the Schedule of Evaluations and Visits (Table 1).  
Response Measures  
Efficacy  
Primary measure: Primary efficacy will be assessed using the Cohe n-Mansfield Agitation Inventory 
(CMAI).  
Secondary measures:  Secondary efficacy measures include: Agitation/Aggression domain of the NPI, 
modified Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study  Clinical Global Impression of Change -Agitation  
(mADCS -CGIC-Agitation), NPI-Agitation/Aggression  domain Caregiver Distress score, NPI -Aberrant 
Motor Behavior domain, Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), NPI -Irritability/Lability d omain , Patient Global 
Impression of Change (PGIC , rated by caregiver), Dementia Quality of Life (DEMQOL) , Cornell Scale 
for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), Resource Utilization in Dementia (RUD), total NPI , ADCS -CGIC -
Overall , CGIS-Agitation, Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale -Cognitive Subscale (ADAS -cog), and 
General Medical Health Rating (GMHR ). 
For consi stency of rating, a ssessments should be performed, whenever possible,  by the same rater 
throughout the study.  The following scales MUST be administered by the same rater at each visit:  
CMAI, NPI, mADCS -CGIC -Agitation, and CGIS-Agitation.  
Pharmacokinetics  
Plasma concentrations of d6 -DM, its metabolites, and Q will be measured. 
Safety and Tolerability  
Safety and tolerability of AVP-786 will be assessed by reported adverse events (AEs), physical and 
neurological examina tions, vital signs, clinical laborator y assessments, resting 12 -lead electrocardiograms 
(ECGs) , Sheehan Suicid ality Tracking Scale ( S-STS), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) , Timed 
Up and Go (TUG) test , and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) .

 Pregnancy tests will be conducted  for females o f childbearing potential . 
General Statistical Methods and Types of Analyses  
Analysis Populations  
Three analysis populations will be used ; modified intent -to-treat (m ITT), intent-to-treat (ITT), and safety.  
The mITT population includes all patients randomi zed in the study who had at least one post -baseline 
efficacy assessment, and will be used for all analyses of efficacy.  Patients in the m ITT population will be 
included in the treatment group to which they were randomized regardless of treatment received.   The 
ITT population includes all randomized patients in the study, and will be used for exploratory efficacy 
analyses.   The safety population includes all patients  who received study treatment, and will be used for 
all analyses of safety .  Patients will b e included in the treatment group based on the actual treatment 
received . 
Efficacy Analyses   
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the SPCD method.  The primary efficacy endpoint of the 
study is the change from Baseline to Week 6  (Day 43, Stage 1)  and from Week 6 to Week 12 (Day 85, 
Stage 2) in the composite CMAI score s.  A weighted test statistics combining treatment effects from 
Stage 1 and 23 will be  used.  The treatment effect in each stage will be estimated by using a  likelihood -
based linear mixed effects mode l repeated measures (MMRM)  on observed data .  Data from Stage 1 
placebo non-responders who are re-randomized into Stage 2 will be  used to estimate the Stage 2 treatment 
effect.   Appropriate procedures to control t ype I error will be implemented  and the details will be 
provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) .    
Secondary efficacy endpoints include chan ge from Baseline to Week 6 (Day 43, Stage 1)  and from 
Week 6 to Week 12  (Day 85, Stage 2) for the following efficacy measures: mADCS -CGIC -Agitation, 
NPI-Agitation/Aggression domain score and Caregiver Distress  score, NPI-Aberrant Motor Behavior  
domain,  ZBI , NPI-Irritability/Lability domain, PGIC, DEMQOL , CSDD, RUD, total NPI , CGIS -
Agitation, ADCS -CGIC -Overall,  ADAS -cog; and change from Baseline to Week 12 for GMHR .   
Safety Analyses  
Safety measures will be summarized by Stage 1, Stage 2, and the 2 stages combined.  
Sample Size Calculation  
Power calculations were performed assuming a bivariate normal distribution for the primary efficacy 
endpoint with AVP -786-28/4.9 (high dose) versus  placebo.

 3 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a  phase 3 , multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, SPCD study  of 12-week 
treatment duration.   The treatment period is divided equally into 2 stages of 6 weeks each, Stage 1 and 
Stage 2.  
Sequence  Screening  Stage 1 Stage  2 
Study Day  Day -28 to -1 Day 1 to 42  Day 43 to 85 
 
There will be 8 scheduled clinic visits including a screening visit, and 2 safety follow-up phone visits in 
this study.  Patients  will attend clinic visits at Screening, Baseline (Day 1), and on Days 8 
(Visit  2/Week  1), 15 (Visit 2.1/Week 2), 22 (Visit 3/ Week 3) , 43 (Visit 4/Week  6), 64 (Visit 5/Week 9), 
and 85 (Visit  6/Week  12).  Safety follow -up phone calls will be made on Days 29 (Week 4) and 
71 (Week  10).  A schematic of the study design is depicted in  Figure 1. 
Approximately 380 patients will be enrolled at approximately 60 centers in North America.    
Eligible patients  will be randomly assigned at the Baseline visit to receive AVP -786 or matching placebo.  
Study medication will be administered orally twice daily from Day 1 through Day 85.  Patients  (or 
caregivers)  will self -admi nister study medication on all study days  except on the clinic -visit days  when 
patients will be administered their morning dose of study medication at the clinic in the presence of site 
personnel, regardless of the time of day.   Screening will occur within  4 weeks prior to randomization.   
Stage 1  
Following screening procedures for assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible patients will 
be randomized into the stud y in a  (active:active:placebo) ratio to receive either AVP-786-28/4.9 
capsules, AVP -786-18/4.9 capsules, or matching placebo capsules.  The randomization will be stratified 
by the NPI  Agitation/Aggression domain score (≤  6 vs. > 6) , risk assessment for falls (normal /mild  vs. 
moderate/severe), and concomitant use of antipsychotic  medications  (yes vs. no) .  Study medication 
(active or placebo) will be administered orally BID (1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule i n the evening 
approximately 12 hours apart) throughout the treatment period.  
• Patients randomized to receive AVP -786-28/4.9 will start with AVP -786-18/4.9 once a day in the 
morning and placebo in the evening for the first 7 days of the study.  From Day 8, patients will receive AVP -786-18/4.9 BID for 14 days.  From Day  22, patients will receive AVP -786-28/4.9 BID 
for the remaining 3-week  duration of Stage 1 .  
• Patients randomized to receive AVP -786-18/4.9 will start with AVP -786-18/4.9 once a day in the 
morning and placebo in the evening for the first 7  days of the study.  From Day 8, patients will 
receive AVP -786-18/4.9 BID for the remaining 5-week duration of Stage 1 . 
• Patients randomized to receive placebo will be dosed with placebo BID during Stage 1 .

Protocol 1 5-AVP -786-301 Version 4.0  
 
 Page 32 
 Stage  2: 
Patients who complete Stage 1 are eligible to participate in the 6 -week Stage 2 of the study.  In Stage 2, 
patients will be assigned to study treatment as follows:  
• Patients who received AVP-786 in Stage 1 will continue to receive  the same dose of AVP -786 BID 
(either AVP -786-28/4.9 or AVP -786-18/4.9 ) for the entire 6 -week duration of Stage  2. 
• Patients who received placebo in Stage 1 will be further stratified into two sub -groups (“responders” 
and “non-responders”) on Visit 4 (Day 43 ) based on their treatment response.  Patients will be 
consi dered “responders” if  
 
 will be considered “non -responders”.   Patients within each placebo sub -group will be 
re-randomized in a   (active:active:placebo) ratio to receive either AVP -786-28/4.9 capsules , 
AVP -786-18/4.9 capsules, or matching placebo capsules. 
o Patients who are re-randomized to placebo will continue to rece ive placebo BID for the entire 
6-week duration of Stage 2. 
o Patients who are re- randomized to AVP -786-28/4.9 will receive AVP -786-18/4.9 once a day 
in the morning and placebo in the evening for the first 7 days of Stage 2 (Days 43-49).  From 
Day 50, patients will receive AVP -786- 18/4.9 BID for 14 days (Days 50 -63).   From Day 64, 
patients will receive AVP -786-28/4.9 BID for the remaining 3 weeks of the study.  
o Patients who are re- randomized to AVP -786-18/4.9 will receive AVP -786-18/4.9 once a day 
in the morning and placebo in the evening for the first 7 days of Stage 2 (Days 43 -49).  From 
Day 50, patients will receive AVP -786-18/4.9 BID for the remaining 5 weeks of the study.

 4 STUDY POPULATION 
Patients enrolled in this  study must have a diagnosis of probable AD and must present with clinically 
meaningful , moderate/sever e agitation  secondary to AD.  
The diagnosis of probable AD will be based on the ‘2011 Diagnostic Guidelines for Alzheimer’s Disease’  
issued by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) -Alzheimer’s Association (AA) workgroups.1  These new 
criteria were developed based  on the review of the NINC DS–ADRDA criteria.22  Neither AD nor 
agitatio n should be explainable  by delirium, substance use and /or major psychiatric disorders.  
The provisional consensus definition of agitation in patients with cognitive disorders  developed by t he 
Agitation Definition Work Group (ADWG) from the International Ps ychogeriatric Association (IPA)2, 
will be used  for selecting study patients.   This proposed definition is limited to patients with cognitive 
impairment and requires:  (a) evidence of emotional distress; (b) one of 3  observable types of behaviors -
excessive motor activity, verbal aggression, or physical aggression; (c) that the behavior causes excess 
disability; and (d) that the behaviors cannot be solely attributable to a suboptimal care environment or 
other disorder such as a psychiatric illness, a medical illness, or effects of a substance.  
Eligible patients must have agitation (persistent or frequen tly recurrent) at the time of study screening and 
for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization and the agitation symptoms must be severe enough such that 
they interfere with daily routine and cause distress to the patient and caregiver for which a prescript ion 
medication is deemed indicated, in the opinion of the treating physician.  
Agitation will further be assessed  using the CGI S-Agitation  scale (0 -7).  A score of ≥ 4 (moderately ill) at 
screening and baseline are required for study participation.  
Eligible patients are to have otherwise  acceptable and stable general health as required by the study 
protocol, and documented by medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and 
clinical laboratory examinations.  
Eligible patients must have a caregiver who is able and willing to comply with all required study 
procedures, ensuring that the patient attends all study visits and takes the study medication as instructed.  
Caregivers will also be instructed to keep a study diary, to report any changes in patient’s status, including adverse events, standard of care setting (e.g., becoming a resident in an assisted living facility) , 
and to provide their impression and assessment regarding the investigational treatment.  In order to 
qualify as a reliable informant  (i.e., caregiver) capable of assessing changes in the patient’s condition 
during this study, the individual must spend a minimum of 2 hours per day  for 4 days per week with the  
study p atient.  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
1. Males and females 50 to 90 years of age, inclusive at the time of informed consent . 
2. Diagnosis of probable AD according to the 2011 NIA -AA working groups criteria.   Either out-
patients or residents o f an assisted -living facility or a skilled nursing home.

 3. The patient has clinically significant, moderate/severe agitation  at the time of screening and for 
at least 2 week s prior to randomization,  that interfere s with daily routine  and for which a 
prescrip tion medication is indicated, in the opinion of the investigator.    
4. The diagnosis of agitation must meet  the IPA provisional definition of agitation.  
5. CGIS-Agitation  score is ≥  4 (moderately ill) at Screening and Baseline.  
6. MMSE score is between 6  and 26 (inclusive) at Screening and Baseline.

4.3 Patient Withdrawal From the Study  
Patients and caregivers will be advised verbally and in the written ICF that they have the right to 
withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice or loss of benefits to which they are otherwise entitled.  The investigator or sponsor may discontinue a patient from the study in the event of an intercurrent illness, adverse event, other reasons concerning the health or well -being of the patient, or in 
the case of lack of cooperation, non-comp liance, protocol violation, or other administrative reasons.  If a 
patient does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the patient. Regardless of the circumstance, every effort should be made to document patient outcome, if possible.  
The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request the caregiver return all unused investigational product (IP), and follow -up with the patient regarding any unresolved adverse events.   
 
 
 
Patients who withdraw prior to study completion will be asked to return to t he clinic to complete the 
Visit  6 (end of study) assessments.    
If the patient withdraws from the study, and consent is withdrawn by the caregiver and/or patie nt’s 
representative for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no 

 AVANIR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC  
Protocol 1 5-AVP -786-301 Version 4.0

Protocol 1 5-AVP -786-301 Version 4.0  
 
 Page 40 
 5.1.5 Storage of Clinical Supplies  
Clinical supplies must be stored in compliance with label requirements in a secure place and kept at room 
temperature; 25°C (77°F) with excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F -86°F).  
5.1.6 Study Medication Administration  
All patients w ill receive study medication according to the blister card  number s assigned by an interactive 
web response system ( IWRS) randomization scheme.   Designated staff at each site will dispense study 
medication.  Study medication should be administered to the pa tient by the caregiver, family member, 
nursing home staff , or self- administered with supervision, except on the applicable clinic visit days  when 
patients will be administered  their dose of study medication  at the clinic  in the presence of site personnel , 
regardless of the time of day.   For Visits 2 (Day 8) and 2.1 (Day 15), t he morning dose of study 
medication can be administered at home if the visit will occur within 2 hours of dosing; the time of dosing should be noted by the patient/caregiver.  Patients  and caregivers will be instructed that the patient should 
take the study medication  orally with water approximately every 12 hours ± 4 hours (morning and 
evening).  The time the  patient takes each dose of medication should be recorded in the diary card.   
Patient’s  missed doses will be noted in the  electronic case report form  (eCRF). 
All study medication will be supplied and administered in a double -blind manner throughout the entire 
duration of the study.  
5.2 Accountability of Study Supplies 
5.2.1 Receipt of Supplie s 
The investigator is responsible for maintaining an inventory of each shipment of IP received and 
comparing it with the accompanying Drug Accountability Report/Material Shipping Form.  The 
investigator will verify the accuracy of the information on the form, sign and date it, and return the form to the sponsor or its representative.  All IP supplied is for use only in this study and should not be used for 
any other purpose.   All blister card  material ID numbers will also be recorded and tracked at the site using 
the Drug Accountability Log.  
5.2.2 Record of Dispensing  
Accurate recording of all IP dispensing for individual patients will be made in the appropriate section of 
the patient’s eCRF.  This eCRF will contain the following information: (i) patient number to whom the 
drug was dispensed; (ii) the date(s) and quantity of the drug dispensed to the patient ; and (iii)  the blister 
card material ID number  assigned to the patient via IWRS .  
Additionally, the detachable panel of the two-panel label on each blister car d will be removed  and affixed 
to the study medication  Dispensing Log page  at the time of dispensing.   Space is provided on both panels 
of the blister card  label to record patient number, the visit week  and dispensing date.   

 AVANIR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC  
Protocol 1 5-AVP -786-301 Version 4.0  
 
 Page 41 
 5.2.3 Unused Supplies  
At the end of the study, all unused investigational supplies must be inventoried on the Drug 
Accountability Log  and returned to the sponsor or its representative, along with a completed and signed 
Drug Accountability Report/Material Shipping Form.   If any study medication is lost or damaged, it 
should be indicated on the form.   
5.3 Methods of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups  
5.3.1 Randomization 
Upon entry into the study ( after ICF is signed  at screening), all patients will be assigned a patient 
number.    
.  This  number is the main identifier for patients. 
Stage 1  
Eligible patients will be randomized to receive AVP -786-28/4.9 capsules, AVP -786-18/4.9  capsules, or 
matching placebo  capsules in a  ratio on Day 1 (Baseline, Stage 1) in a double -blind manner 
according to a randomization scheme devised by Avanir  or its representative and managed within an 
IWRS.  The randomization will be stratified by NPI Agitation/Aggression domain score (≤  6 vs. > 6),  risk 
assessment for falls (normal /mild  vs. moderate/severe ), and concomitant use of antipsychotic medications  
(yes vs. no).  Blocked randomization is used to ensure treatment balance in each stratum.   
Stage 2  
Re-randomization will occ ur for patients who were assigned to placebo in Stage 1.  The patient number 
will not be re -assigned; it will remain the same in both stages of the study.    
• Patients who receive placebo in Stage 1 will be further stratified into two sub -groups (“responders” 
and “non-responders”) based on their treatment responses.  Patients will be considered “responders” 
if  
  Patients who do not meet  will be 
considered “non-responders”.   Patients within each placebo sub -group will be re -randomized in a 
 (active:active:placebo) ratio to receive either AVP -786-18/4.9, AVP -786-28/4.9 capsules, or 
matching placebo capsules.  
• Patients who receive placebo and who drop out early in Stage 1 will also be assigned a re-
randomization treatment  in the same manne r as the other placebo patients .  Their  “responders” and 
“non-responders” status will be based on their treatment responses using measurements at their early 
termination visit.     
• Patients who receive AVP -786 in Stage 1 will not be re -randomized and will continue to receive the 
same dose of AVP -786 BID (either AVP -786-18/4.9 or AVP -786-28/4.9) for the entire 6 -week 
duration of Stage  2. 

 AVANIR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC  
Protocol 1 5-AVP -786-301 Version 4.0  
 
 Page 42 
 5.3.2 Blinding/Masking  
Blinding will be maintained by providing capsules of the 2 doses of AVP -786 and placebo that are 
identica l in appearance.  The sponsor, patients,  caregivers,  investigators, or other study personnel will not 
be aware of a patient’s treatment assignment.   In the event that it becomes medically necessary to identify 
which treatment a patient has received, the bl ind can be broken .  In that event, the investigator is to 
contact Avanir’s medical monitor  or representative to request the unmasking of a patient .  The I WRS 
manager is not required to be blinded and he or she will have access to the study medicat ion list and the 
randomization code.  
5.4 Patient Compliance 
Patients and caregivers will be instructed to bring any unused study medication and empty blister cards to 
the clinic on Days 8, 15, 22, 43, 64, and 85 (Visits 2 – 6).  For this study, compliance will be defin ed as 
when a patient takes at least 80% of their scheduled doses  (compliance range 80-120%) .  Caregivers will 
be provided with diary cards and will be instructed to record daily the number of capsules taken and the 
time of administration.  Diary cards will be reviewed for compliance and collected on Days 22, 43, 64 , 
and 85 (Visits 3 – 6), or at the time of early study discontinuation.  Patients should bring their Diary Card 
on Day  8 (Visit 2) and Day 15 (Visit 2.1) for compliance review;  the Diary Card will be returned to the 
patient and collected at the next visit.

5.5.2 Rescue Medication for the Symptoms of Agitation 
Patients will be allowed to receive oral lorazepam as rescue medication for the short -term treatment of 
symptoms of agitation if deemed necessary by the investigator.  Lorazepam will be administered in a dose 
up to 1.5  mg/day and not to exceed 3 days in a 7- day period.  Caregivers must record concomitant use of 
lorazepam in the diary  and must be reminded of the potential increase in the risk of falling by 
benzodiazepines.

 6 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
6.1 Efficacy  
Samples  of all the scales and questionnaires to be used during the study are attached as Appendices.   
Whenever possible, each patient and caregiver should have the rating scales administered by the same 
raters throughout the study, for consistency of ratings.  The following scales MUST be administered by 
the same rater at each visit:  CMAI, NPI, mADCS- CGIC -Agitation , and CGIS -Agitation.  
6.1.1 Cohen- Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) 
The CMAI will be used as the primary efficacy measure in this study.  The CMAI (Appendix 2) is used to 
assess the frequency of manifestations of agitated behaviors in elderly persons.  It consists of 29  agitated 
behaviors  
  
   
.  E ach of 
the 29 items is rated on a 7 -point scale of frequency (1 = never, 2 = less than once a week but still 
occurring, 3  = once or twice a week , 4 = several times a week, 5  = once or twice a day , 6 = several times a 
day, 7  = several times an hour).  The ratings are based on the 2 weeks preceding assessment of CMAI.  
The CMAI (long -form version, Appendix 2) will be assessed at Screening (Day -28 to Day  -1), Baseline  
(Day 1) , Day 8 (Visit 2), Day 15 (Visit 2.1), Day 22 (Visit 3), Day 43  (Visit 4), Day 64 (Visit 5) , and 
Day 85 (Visit 6 ).  The CMAI must  be administered by the same rater at each visit . 
6.1.2 Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) 
The NPI  is a validated clinical instrument for evaluating psychopathology in a variety of 
disease settings, including dementia.  The NPI is a retrospective caregiver -informant interview covering 
12 neuropsychiatric symptom domains : delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, 
depression /dysphoria , anxiety, elation /euphoria , apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, 
aberrant motor behavior, sleep and nighttime behavioral disorders, and appetite/eating disorder s.  The 
scripted NPI interview includes a compound screening question for each symptom domain, followed by a list of interrogatives about domain-specific behaviors that is administered when a positive response to a screening question is elicited.  Neuropsychiatric manifestations within a domain are collectively rated by the caregiver in terms of both frequency ( 1 to 4) and severity (1 to 3), yielding a composite symptom 
domain score (frequency x severity).   Frequency and severity rating scales have defined anchor points to 
enhance the reliability of caregiver responses.  Caregiver distress is rated for each positive 
neuropsychiatric symptom domain on a scale anchored by scores of 0 (not distressing at all) to 
5 (extremely distressing).  The NPI will be  administered to the patient’s caregiver at Baseline (Day 1) , 
Day 22 (Visit 3), Day 43  (Visit 4), Day 64 (Visit 5), and Day  85 (Visit 6).  The Agitation/Aggression

 Page 46 
 domain of  the NPI  will be administered to the patient’s caregiver at  Screening (Day  -28 to Day -1),Day 8 
(Visit 2)  and Day 15 (Visit 2.1 ).  The NPI must  be administered by the same rater at each visit . 
The NPI domains are generally evaluated for behaviors within the preceding 4 weeks  but can be modified 
according  to the needs of the study .  In this study, the recall period will be 2 weeks for all the  visits  
The NPI nursing-home version (NPI -NH) will be used for patients from in -patient or assisted living 
facilities.  The questions in the NPI -NH were rephrased for professional caregivers who may not know 
the patients prior to the onset of illness; however, the overall instrument domains and scoring is identical 
to the NPI  except for the caregiver distress section which is replaced with occupational disruptiveness in 
the NPI -NH version .    
The Agitation/Aggression domain in the NPI will be assessed as part of the total NPI as described above 
and the composite score obtained for this category will be recorded separately  at Baseline (Day 1), 
Day 22 (Visit 3 ), Day  43 (Visit 4 ), Day 64 (Visit 5), and Day  85 (Visit 6). 
6.1.3 Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Illness- Agitation (CGIS -
Agitation) 
The CGI S (Appendix 4) is an observer -rated scale that measures illness severity and is one of the most 
widely used brief assessment tools  in psychiatry research.   
The Early Clinical Drug Evaluation Unit (ECDEU) version of the CGIS is the most widely used format  of 
this validated tool, and asks that the clinician rate the patient relative to their past experience with other patients with the same diagnosis, with or without collateral information.  The CGI S has proved to be a 
robust measure of efficacy in many clinical drug trials
26–30 and is  easy and quick to administer, provided 
that the clinician knows the patient well.31  
Reliability and validity of CGI have been tested in multiple studies, including patients with dementia, schizophrenia and affective disorders.  Overall, CGI showed high correlation (r:  ~90%) with other 
assessment instruments and it has also shown positive significant relationships and concurrent validity with other clinician’s rating.  I n addition, the scale has good sensitivity to change over time.
32–34 
The CGIS is a 7 -point (1- 7) scale (1  = normal, not at all ill; 7  = among the most extremely ill patients) 
and assesses severity of agitation in this study.  The CGIS-Agitation  will be assessed at Screening (Day -
28 to Da y -1), Baseline (Day 1) , Day 43  (Visit 4), and Day  85 (Visit 6 ).  The CGIS -Agitation must be 
administered by the same rater at each visit . 
6.1.4 Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study - Clinical Global 
Impression of Change Rating (ADCS- CGIC- Overall ) 
The intent of  the ADCS version of the CGIC (Appendix 5) (herein referred to as ADCS-CGIC-Overall),  
is to provide a means to reliably assess change from a baseline level of global function within the 
timeframe  of a clinical tria l.  Unlike a targeted symptom scale, the ADCS -CGIC-Overall takes into 
account a patient's overall function in the cognitive, behavioral and functional activity domains.  Relying 

 AVANIR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC  
Protocol 1 5-AVP -786-301 Version 4.0  
 
 Page 47 
 on information gathered through a semi -structured interview of the patient and  caregiver, the 
ADCS -CGIC -Overall  focuses on clinician’s observations of change in the patient's cognitive, functional, 
and behavioral performance since the beginning of a trial.  Once the baseline level of severity is 
established, the change score at the follow -up visits is based on information gathered from the patient  and 
caregiver interviews.  The ADCS -CGIC -Overall  is rated as: marked improvement, moderate 
improvement, minimal improvement, no change, minimal worsening, moderate worsening, or marked worsening.   
The baseline ADCS-CGIC -Overall  evaluation will be conducted at the Baseline (Day 1)  visit.  The 
ADCS -CGIC -Overall  will be assessed at  Day 43  (Visit 4) and Day  85 (Visit  6) for change in Overall 
Clinical Status.  At Day 43 (Visit  4), change from the Baseline visit (Day 1)  will be assessed.  At Day 85 
(Visit 6 ), change from Day  43 (Visit 4 ) and change from the Baseline visit (Day 1) will be assessed .  
6.1.5 Modified Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study - Clinical Global 
Impression of Change Rating (mADCS-CGIC- Agitation) 
The standard ADCS -CGIC instrument was modified to better assess aspects relevant to studying agitation 
in AD ( mADCS -CGIC -Agitation).  The mADCS -CGIC-Agitation  (Appendix 6) contains questions 
related  to agitation and an assessment of the Clinician’s Impression of Change focused specifically on 
agitation.  It was originally designed for the Citalopram  study for Agitation in Alzheimer’s disease 
(CitAD)35,36 and utilizes a semi -structured interview of both patient  and caregiver  to determine a baseline 
level of severity for agitation.   Subsequent evaluations assess for change from baseline and also utilize the 
semi -struct ured agitation interview of both patient  and caregiver .   
The baseline m ADCS-CGIC -Agitation evaluation will be conducted at the Baseline (Day 1) visit.  The 
mADCS -CGIC -Agitation will be assessed at Day 43  (Visit 4) and Day  85 (Visit  6) for change in agitat ion 
syndrome .  At Day 43 (Visit  4), change from the Baseline visit (Day 1) will be assessed.  At Day 85 
(Visit 6), change from Day  43 (Visit 4) and change from the Baseline visit (Day 1) will be assessed.  The 
mADCS -CGIC -Agitation must be administered by the same rater at each visit. 
6.1.6 Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) 
The ZBI (Appendix 7) is a 22 -item scale used to assess the impact of patient’s disabilities on the 
caregiver’s life.  It is designed to reflect the burden experienced by caregivers of dementia patients and can either be completed by the caregiver or administered as an interview.
37  It is the most commonly used 
scale for measur ing burden in caregivers’ of patie nts with dementia and also other illnesses.38  The ZBI 
has been shown to have high internal-reliability with an estimated Cronbach’s alpha at 0.88 and 0.91, and 
test-retest reliability at 0.71.  Validity has been estimated by correlating the total score with a single 
global rating of burden ( r = 0.71).39  For each item of the scale, the caregiver has to indicate how often 
they felt that way (never, rarely, sometimes, quite frequently, or nearly always).  The score ranges from 0 to 88 and is determined by adding the numbered responses of  the individual items.  Higher scores 
indicate greater caregiver distress.  

 AVANIR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC  
Protocol 1 5-AVP -786-301 Version 4.0  
 
 Page 48 
 The ZBI will be assessed at Baseline (Day 1) , Day 43  (Visit 4), and Day  85 (Visit 6). 
6.1.7 Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI C) 
The PGI C (Appendix 8) is a 7-point (1- 7) scale used to assess treatment response, and it is rated as: very 
much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, or very 
much worse.31 
The PGIC will be assessed and rated by the patient’s caregiver at  Day 43 (Visit 4) and Day  85 (Visit 6) 
and will focus on the patient’s agitation .   
6.1.8 Dementia Quality of Life (DEMQOL)  
The DEMQOL  (Appendix 9) is a scale used to evaluate health related quality of life in patients with 
dementia  and their caregivers.40  There are 2 versions of the DEMQOL, a 28-item version  (rated by 
patient)  and a 31-item version (DEMQOL-proxy, rated by caregiver ).  Both the 28-item and 31-item 
version are recommended to be used for evaluating patients (and their caregivers) with mild to moderate dementia (MMSE ≥10).  For patients with severe dementia, only the DEMQOL-proxy (administered to caregiver) is used.    
The DEMQOL -proxy (and DEMQOL for patients with M MSE ≥10  at the Baseline visit ) will be assessed 
at Baseline (Day 1) , Day 43  (Visit 4 ), and Day  85 (Visit 6 ). 
6.1.9 Alzheimer’s disease Assessment Scale -Cognitive Subscale  
(ADAS -cog) 
The ADAS (Appendix 10) was designed to evaluate the co gnitive and non-cognitive behavioral 
dysfunction characteristics of patients with AD.41  The cognitive sub-scale (ADAS -cog) consists of 
11 subsets related to memory, praxis, and language.  The ADAS -cog takes about 30 to 45 minutes to 
complete.   
The ADAS -cog will be  assessed at Baseline (Day 1), Day 43 (Visit 4), and Day  85 (Visit 6) for patients 
with an MMSE sco re of ≥ 10  at the Baseline visit. 
6.1.10  Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) 
The CSDD (Appendix 11) was specifically developed to assess signs and symptoms of major depression 
in patients with dementia .42  Because some of these patients may give unreliable reports, the CSDD uses a 
comprehensive interviewing approach that derives information from the patient and the caregiver.  
Information is elicited through two semi -structured interviews; an interview with a caregiver and an 
intervie w with the patient.  The interviews focus on depressive symptoms and signs occurring during the 
week preceding the assessment .  The CSDD takes approximately 20 minutes to administer.  
Each item is rated for severity on a scale of 0 -2 (0  = absent, 1  = mild or intermittent, 2  = severe).  The 
item scores are added.  Scores above 10 indic ate a probable major depression,  scores above 18 indicate a 

 AVANIR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC  
Protocol 1 5-AVP -786-301 Version 4.0  
 
 Page 49 
 definite major depression, and s cores below 6 as a rule are associated with absence of significant 
depressive symptoms.  
The CSDD will be  assessed at Screening  (Day -28 to Day -1), Day 43 (Visit 4 ), and Day  85 (Visit 6). 
6.1.11  Resource Utilization in Dementia (RUD) 
The RUD (Appendix 12) is used to calculate healthcare costs associated with dementia.43  It evaluates 
dementia patients’ utilization of formal and informal healthcare resources, including hospitalizations and 
doctor visits, living assistance, and time spent by non- professional caregivers.  Within the context of 
clinica l trials, the RUD is often used to determine the cost effectiveness of new pharmaceutical 
treatments.44   
The RUD is administered as a semi -structured interview with the patient’s primary caregiver, and 
contains 2  sections; one focusing on caregiver impact (loss of work and leisure time incurred by 
caregiver) and the other focusing on the patient’s use of healthcare resources.  The total healthcare costs 
associated with the patient’s dementia can be estimated by multiplying the number of units used (e.g., 
hours of caregiver time, visits to doctors, nights in accommodation) by the corresponding unit price vector.  
The RUD will be assessed at Baseline (Day 1) , Day 43  (Visit 4), and Day  85 (Visit 6). 
6.1.12  General Medical Health Rating (GMHR)  
The GMHR  (Appendix 13) is a global clinical rating  for medical health , designed to quantify in a single 
number (1 to 4) the severity of general co -morbidity in a patient with dementia.45  A rating of 1 = poor, 2 
= fair, 3 = good and 4 = excellent to very good.    
The GMHR  will be assessed at Screening (Day -28 to Da y -1) and Day 8 5 (Visit 6). 
6.2 Pharmacokinetics  (PK)  
At Day 43 (Visit 4 ) and Day 85 (Visit 6), patients will have a blood sample collected between 0 to 3 
hours after the morning dose of study medication for analysis of  plasma levels of  d6-DM, d6-DM 
metabolite s and Q .  The time when the patient was administered  the dose of study medication and the 
time of the blood draw will be recorded on the eCRF.  Plasma samples will be separated by centrifugation 
and then frozen at -20° C until assayed at the analytical uni t.

 6.3 Safety  
6.3.1 Adverse Events 
6.3.1.1  Definitions  
An adverse event ( AE) is any untoward medical occurrence or unintended change (including physical, 
psychological, or behavioral) from the time ICF is signed , including inter -current illness, which occurs 
during the course of a clinical trial after treatment has started, whether considered related to treatment or 
not.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associa ted with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  Changes associated with normal growth and 
development that do not vary in frequency or magnitude from that ordinarily anticipated clinically are not AEs ( e.g., onset of menstruation occurring at a physiologically appropriate time).  
Clinical AEs should be described by diagnosis and not by symptoms when possible ( e.g., cold, seasonal 
allergies, instead of “runny nose”) . 
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher than specified in the protocol and higher than known therapeutic doses.   It must be reported irrespective of outcome even if 
toxic effects were not observed.  
AEs will be graded on a 3 -point scale and repor ted in detail as indicated on the eCRF: 
 Mild:   easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with  
normal everyday activities  
 Moderate:   sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities  
 Severe:   incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities  
The relationship of each AE to study medication should be determined by the investigator using the following explanations:  
 Not related :  the event is clearly related to other factors such as the patient’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the patient  
 Unlikely related :  the event is most likely produced by other factors such as the patient’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the patient; and does not follow a known response pattern to the study medication  
 Possibl y related :  the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug administration; and/or  follows a known response pattern to the study  medication; 
but could have been produced by other factors such as the patient’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the patient  
 Related :   the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of  drug 
administration; and follows a known response pattern to the study medication ; 

 AVANIR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC  
Protocol 1 5-AVP -786-301 Version 4.0  
 
 Page 51 
 and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the patient’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the 
patient 
6.3.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE ) is any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
1. Death  
2. Life-threatening experience (one that places the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at 
immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred, i.e., it does not include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death)  
3. Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is a substantial disruption of a person’s 
ability to conduct normal life functions)  
4. In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
5. Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, or be life -threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
patient or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  
The terms “cancer” and “overdose” are not considered to be SAEs, but if a patient exp eriences cancer  or 
overdose , they are  still reportable  as AEs. 
Pregnancy is not considered to be an AE or an SAE , unless a complication occurs that meets the 
requirements for an AE or SAE , but must be reported on a pregnancy report form.   Women who are 
pregnant or likely to become pregnant are excluded from this study.  In the event a patient becomes 
pregnant during the study, study medication must be discontinued, a pregnancy report form must be 
completed to capture potential drug exposure during pregnancy, and the pregnancy must be reported 
within 24 hours of notice .  Any pregnant patient must be followed until the outcome of her pregnancy is 
known (i.e., normal delivery, abnormal delivery, spontaneous/voluntary/therapeutic abortion).  The 
pregnancy (i.e., the mother and the fetus) must be followed up through delivery with regard to outcome.  
A pregnancy report  form must also be completed in the event that a female partner of a male patient 
becomes pregnant within 30 days after his last dose of study medication  or study completion, whichever 
is greater.   
The term ‘severe’ is a measure of intensity; thus a severe AE is not necessarily serious.  For example, 
nausea of several hours duration may be rated as severe, but may not be clinically serious.  

 AVANIR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC  
Protocol 1 5-AVP -786-301 Version 4.0  
 
 Page 52 
 6.3.1.3  Reporting 
Caregivers will be queried regarding AEs at each clinic visit after the screening visit  (Baseline [Day 1] , 
Days 8, 15, 22 , 43, 64, and 85 [Visit s 2-6]) and at safety follow- up phone calls at Days 29 and 71.  The 
investigator will assess and record all reported AEs.  Any AE newly reported after receiving the last dose 
of study medication will be followed  up until 30  days.  
A death occurring during the study , or which comes to the attention of the investigator within 30 days 
after stopping the treatment whether considered treatment -related or not, must be reported to the sponsor.  
For all SAEs, including an abnormal laboratory test value, the investigator should consult with Avanir’s 
MM or designated representative as needed and report any SAE by fax/email  form no later than 24 hours 
after becoming aware of the event.  Subsequently, the SAE must be assessed for the following details: 
seriousness of event, start date, stop date, intensity, frequency, relationship to test drug, action taken 
regarding test drug, treatment required, and outcome to date.  These details must be recorded on the 
clinical study AE f orm that is provided.   This form should be transmitted by fax and the details given by 
telephone to the contact numbers below . 
SAE reporting by FAX or e-mail co rrespondence  
FAX:   
E-mail:  
SAE hotlin e
 (24-hour/7 days a week)  
Phone:   
Such preliminary reports will be followed by detailed descriptions later, which may include copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports, and other related documents when requested.  
The Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee  (IRB/EC ) will be notified of such an event in writing 
as soon as is practical  in compliance with federal and local regulations . 
6.3.1.4  Procedures to be followed  in the Event of Abnormal Test Values 
Any patients with clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results may be required  by the MM to 
have a repeat test 1 week  later or earlier, if medically indicated.  Clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities may be a basis for exclusion from study entry.  
6.3.2 Physica l and Neurological Examinations 
Physical and neurological examinations  will be performed at Screening  (Day -28 to Day -1), Day  43 
(Visit 4), and Day 85 (Visit 6).  The physical examination will  include assessments of head, eyes, ears, 
nose, throat, lymph nodes, skin, extremities, respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and nervous systems.  The neurological  examination will include assessments of mental status, cranial 
nerves, motor system, reflexes, coordination, gait and station, and sensory system.   The physical and 
neurological examinations  should be performed by the same person each time, whenever possi ble.  

 AVANIR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC  
Protocol 1 5-AVP -786-301 Version 4.0  
 
 Page 53 
 Physical and neurological examination abnormalities determined by the investigator to be clinically 
significant at Screening should be recorded as medical history.  
Any clinically significant changes in physical and neurological examination findings from the screening 
examination should be recorded as AEs.  
6.3.3 Vital Signs 
Orthostatic blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) measurements will be performed at all clinic visits.  
Supine BP and HR will be measured after a patient has rested for at least 5 minutes in the supine position.  Each measurement will be taken twice in the same position and recorded .  After the measurement of 
supine BP and HR, the patient will stand still for up to 3 minutes and a single measurement of standing BP and HR will be recorded within these 3 minutes of standing.  
Respiratory rate (breaths/minute) and body temperature (ºF ) will be assessed  at all clinic visits.  Weight 
will be recorded at Baseline (Day 1) and Day 85 (Visit 6).  
6.3.4 Clinical Laboratory Tests 
The following clinical laboratory assessments are to be performed at Screening  (Day -28 to Day  -1), 
Day 22 (Visit 3), Day  43 (Visit 4), Day 64 (Visit 5), and Day 85 (Visit 6): 
• Blood chemistry (calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, 
carbon dioxide, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], serum creatinine, uric acid, albumin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], aspartate aminotransferase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [AST/SGOT], alanine aminotransferase/serum glutamic pyruv ic 
transaminase [ALT/SGPT], creatine kinase [CK], gamma -glutamyl transferase [GGT], 
triglycerides, total protein, and total cholesterol)  
• Hematology (red blood cell [RBC] count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell [WBC]  
count , neutrophils, bands, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, platelet count, and 
morphology)  
• Urinalysis (pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose, ketones,  blood,  leucocyte esterase, nitrates , 
and microscopic appearance)  
• Thyroid function t ests (TSH, and reflex T3 and T4  if TSH is abnormal ) at Screening visit only 
• Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) test at the Screening visit and Visit 6  only 
Any patients with clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results may be required  by the MM to 
have a repeat test 1 week  later or earlier, if medically indicated.  Clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities may be a basis for exclusion from study entry.

 6.3.5 Pregnancy Tests 
Urine pregnancy tests are to be performed for females of childbearing potential at Screening  (Day -28 to 
Day -1), Baseline (Day  1), Day  43 (Visit 4 ), and  Day 85 (Visit 6). 
All female patients  of childbearing potential should be instructed to use appropriate birth control methods 
for up to 4 weeks following the last dose of study medication .  
6.3.6 Electrocardiograms  
A resting 12-lead ECG will be performed at all clinic visits  except on Day 8 (Visit 2).  At Screening, ECG 
will be performed in triplicate.  At Baseline (Day  1) and Day  43 (Visit 4), two ECGs will be performed; 
one prior to study medication dosing and one 2-3 hours after dosing .  ECG equipment will be provided by 
the central reader.   ECG data will be recorded at the study center and will include general findings, heart 
rate (beats/minute) QRS complex and PR and QTc intervals (milliseconds).  Results will be prov ided by 
the central reader to the i nvestigators  within 24  hours.  ECG data will be transferred automatically from 
the central reader into the eCRF monthly.  ECG abnormalities present at Screening will be recorded as 
medical history.  Any changes from the ECG status at Screening  Visit  that are deemed to be clinically 
significant by the investigator should be captured as AEs.   Any clinically significant abnormal ECG 
should be discussed with the study MM and, if necessary be repeated within a 1 -week period.  
6.3.7 Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale (S -STS)  
The S-STS (Appendix 14 ) is a prospective scale that assesses treatment -emergent suicidal thoughts and 
behaviors .46  Each item of the S-STS is scored on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = n ot at all; 1 = a little; 
2 = moderate; 3 = very; and 4 = extremely) .  The Sheehan -STS can be analyzed as individual item scores, 
suicidal ideation subscale score, suicidal behavior subscale score, or total score.   For the screening visit, 
the timeframe for the items on the scale will be ‘in the p ast 6 months’ and for all other visits it will be 
‘since last visit’.   
The S-STS will be  assessed  at Screening (Day -28 to Day -1), Baseline (Day 1), Day 8 (Visit 2) , Day 15 
(Visit 2.1), Day 22 (Visit 3), Day 43  (Visit 4), Day 64 (Visit 5), and Day  85 (Vi sit 6).  Any change in the 
S-STS score indicating the presence of suicidality should be evaluated by the investigator  and reported to 
the MM.  
6.3.8 Mini- Mental State Examination (MMSE)  
The MMSE (Appendix 15) is a brief 30 -point questionnaire test that is used to screen for cognitive 
impairment.  It is commonly used in medicine to screen for dementia.  It is also used to estimate the 
severity of cognitive impairment at a specific time and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time, thus making it an effective way to document an individual’s response to treatment.  
The MMSE scale comprises 11 questions or simple tasks concerning orientation, memory, attention, and language to evaluate the patient’s cognitive state.
47  It requires only 5 to 10 minutes for a trained rater to 
administer it. 

 AVANIR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC  
Protocol 1 5-AVP -786-301 Version 4.0  
 
 Page 55 
 The MMSE will be assessed at Screening (Day -28 to Day -1), Baseline  (Day 1) , Day 43  (Visit 4), and 
Day 85 (Visit 6 ). 
6.3.9 Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test 
The TUG test (Appendix 16) measures the time (in seconds) taken for an individual to stand up from a 
standard armchair, walk 3 meters, turn, walk back to the chair and sit down.  It is a commonly used scale 
for measuring  functional mobility and risk of falls.48,49  
The TUG test will be performed at Screening (Day -28 to Day -1), Day 43  (Visit 4 ), and Day  85 (Visit 6 ).  
6.3.10  Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)  
The ESS (Appendix 17) is an 8-item questionnaire  that is used to measure sleepiness by rating the 
probability of fal ling asleep on 8 different situations that most people engage in during the day .50  The 
questions are rated on a 4 point s cale (0 to 3) where 0 = would never  doze , 1 = slight chance of dozing, 
2 = moderate chance o f doz ing, and 3 = high chance of dozing.  A total score of 0 to 9 is considered to be 
normal.    
The ESS will be assessed at Baseline (Day 1), Day 43  (Visit 4 ), and Day  85 (Visit 6 ).  
6.4 Schedule of Evaluations and Procedures 
A schedule of evaluations and procedures  for both Stage 1 and Stage 2 is provided in Table 1. 
6.4.1 Description of Study Procedures  
At each visit t hroughout the study, site staff will be required to enter informat ion into the IWRS regarding 
patient data and pre-defined study assessment  results.  Further instructions will be provided in the IWRS 
Site Manual. 
6.4.1.1  Screening Visit (Days -28 to -1, + 3-day window ) 
The following procedures will be performed at  Screening (within 28 days prior to Day 1).   The screening 
period may be extended after discussion with and approval by the MM.  In th e event that a patient is 
rescreened for enrollment, new informed consent and/or assent documents  must be signed, new patient

 7 DATA MANAGEMENT 
7.1 Data Collection 
The sponsor  or designated representative (e.g., CRO) will perform the data management activities in 
accordance with the data management plan (DMP).  The DMP  will outline the systems and procedures to 
be used  in the study . 
Clinical study data will be reported (captured) by study site personnel on eCRFs.  An eCRF must be 
completed for every patient enrolled in the study.  The eCRF data will be entered by trained study -site 
personnel and then reviewed for completeness and accuracy and electronically signed by the investigator 
or authorized designee .  All study -site personnel must use a password -protected user account  to enter, 
review, or correct study data.  Electronic signature procedures shall co mply with the CFR Title 21 
Part 11.  Passwords will be strictly confidential.  
All eCRF data will be exported  from the electronic data capture (EDC) system and transferred to the 
sponsor  or representative.  The sponsor  or representativ e will also receive electronic transfers of non-
eCRF data such as laboratory data from the central laboratory, ECG data from the central ECG reader,  as 
well as other data from third-party vendors as appropriate.  The electronic data format of all transfers  will 
be agreed upon with the sponsor or representative and documented in the DMP or vendor data transfer requirements document as appropriate.  
The clinical monitoring staff will perform source data verification (SDV) of the data recorded in the EDC 
system  with source documents at the clinical study sites according to the data management plan and 
clinical monitoring plan.  The data will be subjected to consistency and validation checks within the EDC system with supplemental data reviews performed outside of the EDC system.   
Medical h istory and adverse events will be coded using a current version of Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), and concomitant medications using a current version of the WHO Drug Dictionary.  The sponsor or represent ative will perform a medical safety review of the coding.  
Completed eCRF images with a date- and time -stamped electronic audit trail indicating the user, the data 
entered, and any reason for change (if applicable) will be archived at the investigator’s site and at the sponsor’s site.

 8 STATISTICAL METHODS  
8.1 Analysis Populations 
Three analysis populations will be u sed, modified intent -to-treat (m ITT), intent-to -treat (ITT), and safety.  
• mITT:  The m ITT population includes all patients randomized in the study who had at least one 
post-baseline efficacy assessment.  The mITT population will be used for all analyses of efficacy.   
Patients will be included in the treatment group to which they were randomized regardless of 
treatment received.  
• ITT:  The ITT population includes all randomized patients in the study.  The ITT population will 
be used for exploratory efficacy analyses.  
• Safety:  The safety population includes all patients who received study treatment.  The safety 
population will be used for all analyses of safety .  Patients will be included in the treatment group 
based on the actual treatment received. 
8.2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic  and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group for the ITT and m ITT 
populations  using descriptive statistics.  
8.3 Efficacy Analysis  
The efficacy measures are assessed in each of the two stages of the trial.  For the primary efficacy analysis, as well as for all other efficacy analyses, the SPCD method will be used to combine data from Stage 1 and 2.   Data from Stage 1 placebo non-responders who are re-randomized into Stage 2 will be  
used to estimate Stage 2 treatment effect .  
8.3.1 Study Endpoints  
Primary efficacy endpoint : 
The primary efficacy end point  is the change from Baseline to Week 6 ( Day 43, Stage 1)  and from Week 6 
to Week 12 ( Day 85, Stage 2)  in the composite CMAI scores. 
 
Secondary efficacy endpoints : 
The secondary efficacy  endpoints are the change from B aseline to Week 6 (Day 43, Stage 1)  and from 
Week 6 to Week 12 (Day 85, Stage 2)  in the  following measures:   
• mADCS -CGIC -Agitation   
• NPI – Agitation/Aggression domain score and Caregiver Distress score

• DEMQOL  
• CSDD  
• ADAS -cog   
• RUD  
• GMHR  (change from Baseline to Week 12  (Day 85)  
8.3.2 Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from Baseline to Week 6 ( Day 43, Stage 1)  and from Week 6 
to Week 12 (Day 85, Stage 2) in the composite CMAI scores.  The pr imary efficacy analysis will be 
based on SPCD method using a weighted test statistics  combining treatment effects from Stage 1 and 2.3  
Data from Stage 1 placebo non-responders who are re-randomized into Stage 2 will be used to estimate 
Stage 2 treatment effect. 
For the primary efficacy endpoint , the null hypothesis is that there is no treatment effect in Stage 1 and 
Stage 2 and it will be tested against the alternative that there is a treatment effect in at least one of the 2 
stages.  The treatment effect in each stage will be estimated by using a  likelihood -based linear mixed 
effects model repeated measures (MMRM)  on observed data .  The model will include fixed effects f or 
treatment,  visit, treatment -by-visit interaction, baseline-by -visit interaction  and baseline covariates which 
include baseline value and other randomization stratification factors.   An unstructured covariance model 
will be used .  Analyses with missing v alues imputed by last observation carried forward ( LOCF ) and 
Multiple Imputation (MI) may be performed as sensitivity analyses.  
The 2 primary comparisons are AVP- 786-28/4.9 vs. placebo  and AVP -786-18/4.9 vs. p lacebo.  An 
appropriate multiple comparison procedure will be used to control the overall type I error at 2-sided α = 
0.05.   
8.3.3 Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Secondary efficacy endpoints include change from B aseline to Week 6 (Day 43, Stage 1) and from 
Week  6 to Week 12 (Day 85, Stage 2) for the following efficacy measures: mADCS -CGIC -Agitation,

domain  score , ZBI, NPI-Irritab ility/Lability  domain score, PGIC , DEMQOL , CSDD, RUD , total NPI , 
CGIS-Agitation, ADCS -CGIC-Overall,  ADAS -cog; and change from Baseline to Week 12 for GMHR .   
Treatment comparison tests using similar  SPCD method as the primary efficacy analysis will be 
performed .  A proper multiple comparison procedure, e.g, gate keeping procedure, will be used to control 
overall type I error at 2 -sided α = 0.05 for treatment comparisons (high dose vs. placebo, low dose vs. 
placebo) and the secondary endpoints tested .  The testing procedure  will be pre -specified in the stati stical 
analysis plan (SAP) before un-blinding the study .   
 
  Detailed analyse s will 
be described in the SAP. 
8.4 PK/PD  Analysis  
Plasma concentrations of d6 -DM, its metabolites, and Q will be measured and results will be summarized 
descriptively overall .  Plasma 
concentration results will be used to assess the PK properties of d6 -DM and its metabolites.  Additional 
PK/PD correlations may also be performed.  Additional details will be described in the SAP.  
8.5   
 
    
8.6 Safety Analysis  
Safety will be assessed by the following measurements:   AEs, p hysical an d neurological examination, 
vital sign s, urine pregnancy test, clinical laboratory assessments,  resting 12-lead ECG, S-STS, MMSE, 
TUG test , and ESS.   All safety measures will be summarized by Stage 1, Stage 2, and the 2 stages  
combined.  
Safety analyses will consist of data summaries for biological parameters and AEs.   Safety analyses will be 
tabulated by treatment.   
8.6.1 Adverse Events 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  The percentages 
of patients experiencing 1 or more AEs will be summarized by treatment , system organ class (SOC) , 
deaths, non-fatal SAEs, AEs, AEs resulting in study discontinuation, and treatment-emergent AEs  
(TEAE).  TEAEs are those AEs that occur after the first dose of study medication up until  30 days after 
last dose.

 8.6.2 Vital Signs and ECGs  
Summary statistics of absolute values and percentage change from baseline for BP (diastolic and 
systolic), heart rate, respiratory rate, and ECG parameters will be provided.   All values outside a pre-
define d normal range will be highlighted in the individual patient data listings.  
8.6.3 Clinical Laboratory Values 
Laboratory parameters will be summarized via descriptive statistics and via shifts in results in respect to 
normal ranges between Screening and end of tr eatment as increased, decreased, or no change.  
8.6.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
The sponsor will appoint a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the periodic review of available study data.  
The DSMB is an independent group of experts that advises the sponsor and the study investigators.  The 
members of the DSMB serve in an individual capacity and provide their expertise and recommendations.  
The primary responsibilities of the DSMB are to ( 1) periodically review and evaluate the accumulated 
study data for participant safety, study conduct and progress, and (2) make recommendations to the sponsor concerning the continuation, modification, or termination of the study.  
The DSMB considers study -specific data as well as relevant background knowledge about  the disease, 
test agent, or patient population under study.  
The DSMB is responsible for defining its deliberative processes, including event triggers that would call for an unscheduled review, stopping guidelines, unmasking, and voting procedures prior t o initiating any 
data review.  The DSMB is also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of its internal discussions 
and activities as well as the contents of reports provided to it.  
8.6.5 Interim Analysis  
Interim analysis may be performed and will be pre-specified in the SAP.  
8.7 Sample Size Calculations  
Power calculations were performed assuming a bivariate normal distribution for the primary efficacy endpoint with AVP -786-28/4.9  (high dose) versus placebo.

 9 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCE DURES  
9.1 Institutional  Review Board /Ethics Committee  Approval  
Institutional Review Boards /Ethics Committees (IRBs/ECs)  must meet the guidelines set out by the FDA 
and conform to local laws and customs where appropriate.  Written IRB/EC  approval for the protocol and 
the signed ICF must be obtained and transmitted to Avanir Pharmaceuticals or representative before the 
study can be initiated.  The IRB/EC  must be informed of and approve all protocol amendments.  The 
investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformance with local  laws and according to 
National and State/Provincial laws  (Appendix 18, Investigator Responsibilities).  The complete text of the 
World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki is given in  Appendix 19.  
9.2 Informed Consent Form  
The ICF  will follow the principles outlined in the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki .  For e ach 
patient found to be eligible for the study, informed consent  will be obtained from the patient (if the patient 
is capable in the judgment of the investigator to provide informed consent) or the authorized 
representative.  For patients that are not capable of providing informed consent, but are capable of 
providing assent,  the patient will be asked to provide assent.  If the patient is not capable of providing 
assent, the investigator will document the reasons why and maintain that documentation with the other 
informed consent documents.  The patient’s caregiver will also be asked to provide informed consent as 
they will be providing data on themselves and the patient, as well as, being responsible for ensuring compliance from the patient between study visits.  
The patient s and/or patient ’s authorized representative and the caregiver  will be properly informed of the 
purpose of the study.  The patients and/or patient ’s authorized representative and the caregiver  will be 
alerted to any anticipated AE that may be encountered with the study medication.  A signed ICF will be 
obtained from all patients and/or patient’s authorized representative and the caregiver  prior to patient 
entry into this study.  Patients and/or patient’s authorized representative and the caregiver  will be 
provided with a copy of their signed ICF . 
9.3 Patient’s  Diar y Card 
The patient’s Diary Card  will be reviewed by clinical study personnel at all study treatment visits  for 
confirmation of medication dosage  and any rescue medication received .  The study personnel are 
responsible for (i) ensuring that patients  and/or caregivers are properly collecting data and recording it 
into the diaries; and (ii) transcribing the diary recordings into the eCRF.  The diary will be collected at all 
study visits after baseline except Visit 2 (Day 8)  and Visit 2.1 (Day 15),  wherein the diary will be 
reviewed and returned to the patient .  The originals of all diaries will be maintained at the site as source 
documents.  

 AVANIR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC  
Protocol 1 5-AVP -786-301 Version 4.0  
 
 Page 74 
 9.4 Electronic Case Report Forms 
For each patient enrolled who has given informed consent, an eCRF must be completed and electronically 
signed by the investigator to certify that the data within each eCRF are complete and correct.  This also 
applies to those patients who fail to complete the study.   If a patient is withdrawn from the study because 
of a treatment -limiting AE, thorough e fforts should be made to document the outcome.  
Any site personnel delegated responsibility for data entry, query resolution, or eCRF approval must 
complete training prior to accessing the e CRF .  The electronic data capture (EDC) vendor will provide 
user-specific access to the live (production) eCRF once training completion has been confirmed and the 
account has been approved by the sponsor.   Changes to the data once it has been initially saved will be 
tracked via audit trail and will require a reason for the change.  The audit trail will also include who made 
the change and a date/time stamp.  
The eCRFs will be reviewed by the study monitor at the study site.   Errors detected by subsequent in-
house  data review may necessitate clarification or correction of errors.  All changes will be documented 
and approved by the investigator.  
All investigators will be provided with copies of the eCRFs for their site on a CD-ROM at the end of the 
study.  
9.5 Quality Assurance  
9.5.1 Documentation  
For each process, evaluation, or test t hat generates study data but is not described in the protocol or eCRF, 
a written description of the data generation procedures shall be retained in the quality assurance section of 
the study files.   In the case of routine clinical diagnostic procedures, only a copy of the relevant 
certification document is required.  
9.5.2 Monitoring  
Throughout the course of the study, the study monitor will make frequent contacts with the investigator.   
This will include telephone calls and on -site visits.  The study will be routinely monitored to ensure 
compliance with the study protocol and the overall quality of data collected.  During the on-site visits, the 
eCRFs will be reviewed for completeness and adherence to the protocol.  As part of the data audit, source 
documents will  be made available for review by the study monitor.  The study monitor may periodically 
request review of the investigator study file to assure the completeness of documentation in all respects of 
clinical study conduct.  
The study monitor will verify that each patient has proper consent  documentation from the patient and/or 
patient’s authorized representative and the caregiver for study procedures and for the release of medical 
records to the sponsor, FDA , other regulatory authorities , and the  IRB/EC .  The study monitor will also 
verify that assent was obtained for patients not capable of providing informed consent  or that 

 AVANIR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC  
Protocol 1 5-AVP -786-301 Version 4.0  
 
 Page 75 
 documentation is provided by the investigator explaining why the patient  was unable to provide assent .  
The investigator or appointed del egate will receive the study monitor during these on-site visits and will 
cooperate in providing the documents for inspection and respond to inquiries.   In addition, the 
investigator will permit inspection of the study files by authorized representatives o f the regulatory 
agencies.  
On completion of the study, the study monitor will arrange for a final review of the study files after which 
the files should be secured for the appropriate time period.  
9.6 Record  Retention 
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Avanir, the investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link records, e.g., 
CRFs and hospital records), all original signed ICFs , copies of all eCRFs, SAE forms, source documents, 
and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (e.g., letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be retained by the investigator 
according to ICH, loca l regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement, whichever is longer.  
If the investigator is unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the required period ( e.g., 
retirement, relocation), Avanir should be prospectively not ified.  The study records must be transferred to 
a designee acceptable by Avanir, such as another investigator, another institution, or to Avanir.  The 
investigator must obtain Avanir’s written permission before disposing of any records, even if retention requirements have been met.  
9.7 Source Data  
The documents that will form the source data for the clinical study ( e.g., patient charts, laboratory reports) 
must be defined and documented in the in-house study master file prior to the start of the study.  Data o n 
the eCRFs which will be checked against source data during monitoring visits must also be defined and 
documented in the in- house study master file including the percentage of each of the source data to be 
verified and the percentage of patients’ eCRFs to  be monitored.  
9.8 Data Handling  
Data collected on the eCRFs will be entered into EDC  system by trained site staff.  Any queries arising 
from data entry will be checked with the investigator and changes approved.  
9.9 Laboratory Procedures  
Each individual site lab oratory will collect hematology and chemistry blood samples and urine samples  at 
Screening  (Day -28 to Day -1), and Visits 3 -6 (Day  22, Day  43, Day 64, and  Day 85) for safety analysis.   
Instructions for specimen evaluation and transport to a central laboratory will be provided at the time of study initiation.  Blood samples will also be taken  at Baseline (Day  1) and for 

 AVANIR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC  
Protocol 1 5-AVP -786-301 Version 4.0  
 
 Page 76 
 PK analysis on Visits 4 and 6 (Day 43 and Day  85).  Instructions for shipping the laboratory samples for 
evaluation b y central facilities will be provided.  
9.10 Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice 
Standards for GCP  must be adhered to for all study -based procedures.  
9.11 Conditions for Amending the Protocol  
Protocol modification to ongoing studies which could potentially adversel y affect the safety of patients or 
which alter the scope of the investigation, the scientific quality of the study, the experimental design, 
dosages, duration of therapy, assessment variables, the number of patients treated, or patient selection criteria m ust be made only after appropriate consultation between an appropriate representative of Avanir 
and the investigator.  
Protocol modifications must be prepared by a representative of Avanir or the investigator , and reviewed 
and approved by Avanir.    
All protocol modifications must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate IRB /EC in accordance with 
local requirements, before the revised edition can be implemented.  Modifications which eliminate an 
apparent immediate hazard to patients do not require pre-appr oval by the IRB /EC. 
9.12 Conditions for Terminating the Study  
Both Avanir and the principal investigator reserve the right to terminate the study at the site at any time.   
Should this be necessary, the procedures to effect study termination will be arranged after review and consultation by both parties.   In terminating the study, Avanir and the investigator will assure that 
adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient’s interests.  
9.13 Confidentiality of Study Documents and Patient Records 
The investigator must assure that the patient’s anonymity will be maintained.  On eCRFs or other 
documents submitted to Avanir, patients should not be identified by their names but by an identification code.  
The investigator should keep a separate log of patient’ s codes, names, and addresses.   Documents not for 
submission to Avanir, for example, patients ’ signed ICFs, should be maintained by the investigator in 
strict confidence.  
9.14 Reports  
At the completion of the study, the investigator shall provide the sponsor with an adequate report shortly after completion of the investigator's participation in the study  as described in the Code of Federal 
Regulations ( CFR) Title  21, Part 312.64.  

 AVANIR PHARMACEUTICALS, INC  
Protocol 1 5-AVP -786-301 Version 4.0  
 
 Page 77 
 9.15 Publications 
It is anticipated that a report of this study will be published in the  scientific literature by the sponsor.  The 
investigator will not seek to arrange for publication of any of the information or results from the study in 
any scientific journal, or other publication or by way of lecture without Avanir’s prior review and wri tten 
consent.  
9.16 Audits/Inspections  
The investigator should understand that source documents for this study should be made available to appropriately qualified personnel or designee(s) from Avanir or to health authority inspectors after appropriate notificat ion.  The verification of the eCRF data may be by direct inspection of source 
documents (where permitted by law) or through an interview exchange.  
The inspector from the regulatory authority will be especially interested in the following items:  
• Visits from  the sponsor’s representatives  
• IRB/EC  approval(s)  
• Study medication accountability  
• Study protocol and amendments  
• ICFs of the  patient (if capable of providing ICF, according to the investigator) or patient’s 
authorized representatives and caregivers 
• Assent o f the patients (if capable of providing assent, according to the investigator)  
• Medical records supportive of eCRF data  
• Reports to the IRB/EC  and the sponsor  
• Record retention  
The sponsor will be available to help investigators prepare for an inspection.

4.8.1  In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should
comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to GCP
and to the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
Prior to the beginning of the trial, the investigator should have the IRB/IEC's
written approval/favorable opinion of the written informed consent form and any
other written information to be provided to subjects.
4.8.2  The written informed consent form and any other written information to be
provided to subjects should be revised whenever important new information
becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s consent.  Any revised
written informed consent form, and written information should receive the
IRB/IEC's approval/favorable opinion in advance of use.  The subject or the
subject’s legally acceptable representative should be informed in a timely manner if
new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s
willingness to continue participation in the trial.  The communication of this
information should be documented.
4.8.3  Neither the investigator, nor the trial staff, should coerce or unduly influence
a subject to participate or to continue to participate in a trial.
4.8.4  None of the oral and written information concerning the trial, including the
written informed consent form, should contain any language that causes the subject
or the subject's legally acceptable representative to waive or to appear to waive
any legal rights, or that releases or appears to release the investigator, the
institution, the sponsor, or their agents from liability for negligence.
4.8.5  The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, should fully
inform the subject or, if the subject is unable to provide informed consent, the
subject's legally acceptable representative, of all pertinent aspects of the trial
including the written information given approval/favorable opinion by the
IRB/IEC.
4.8.6  The language used in the oral and written information about the trial,
including the written informed consent form, should be as nontechnical as practical
and should be understandable to the subject or the subject's legally acceptable
representative and the impartial witness, where applicable. 
184.8.7  Before informed consent may be obtained, the investigator, or a person
designated by the investigator, should provide the subject or the subject's legally
acceptable representative ample time and opportunity to inquire about details of
the trial and to decide whether or not to participate in the trial.  All questions
about the trial should be answered to the satisfaction of the subject or the subject's
legally acceptable representative.
4.8.8  Prior to a subject’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent
form should be signed and personally dated by the subject or by the subject's
legally acceptable representative, and by the person who conducted the informed
consent discussion. 
4.8.9  If a subject is unable to read or if a legally acceptable representative is
unable to read, an impartial witness should be present during the entire informed
consent discussion.  After the written informed consent form and any other written
information to be provided to subjects is read and explained to the subject or the
subject’s legally acceptable representative, and after the subject or the subject’s
legally acceptable representative has orally consented to the subject’s participation
in the trial, and, if capable of doing so, has signed and personally dated the
informed consent form, the witness should sign and personally date the consent
form.  By signing the consent form, the witness attests that the information in the
consent form and any other written information was accurately explained to, and
apparently understood by, the subject or the subject's legally acceptable
representative, and that informed consent was freely given by the subject or the
subject’s legally acceptable representative.
4.8.10  Both the informed consent discussion and the written informed consent
form and any other written information to be provided to subjects should include
explanations of the following:
(a)  That the trial involves research.
(b)  The purpose of the trial.
(c)  The trial treatment(s) and the probability for random assignment to
each treatment.
(d)  The trial procedures to be followed, including all invasive procedures.
(e)  The subject's responsibilities.
(f)  Those aspects of the trial that are experimental.
19(g)  The reasonably foreseeable risks or inconveniences to the subject and,
when applicable, to an embryo, fetus, or nursing infant.
(h)  The reasonably expected benefits.  When there is no intended clinical
benefit to the subject, the subject should be made aware of this. 
(i)  The alternative procedure(s) or course(s) of treatment that may be
available to the subject, and their important potential benefits and risks. 
(j)  The compensation and/or treatment available to the subject in the event
of trial-related injury. 
(k)  The anticipated prorated payment, if any, to the subject for
participating in the trial.
(l)  The anticipated expenses, if any, to the subject for participating in the
trial.
(m)  That the subject's participation in the trial is voluntary and that the
subject may refuse to participate or withdraw from the trial, at any time,
without penalty or loss of  benefits to which the subject is otherwise
entitled. 
(n)  That the monitor(s), the auditor(s), the IRB/IEC, and the regulatory
authority(ies) will be granted direct access to the subject's original medical
records for verification of clinical trial procedures and/or data, without
violating the confidentiality of the subject, to the extent permitted by the
applicable laws and regulations and that, by signing a written informed
consent form, the subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative
is authorizing such access.
(o)  That records identifying the subject will be kept confidential and, to the
extent permitted by the applicable laws and/or regulations, will not be made
publicly available.  If the results of the trial are published, the subject’s
identity will remain confidential. 
(p)  That the subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative will
be informed in a timely manner if information becomes available that may
be relevant to the subject's willingness to continue participation in the trial. 
(q)  The person(s) to contact for further information regarding the trial and
the rights of trial subjects, and whom to contact in the event of trial-related
injury. 
20(r)  The foreseeable circumstances and/or reasons under which the subject's
participation in the trial may be terminated. 
(s)  The expected duration of the subject's participation in the trial.
(t)  The approximate number of subjects involved in the trial. 
4.8.11  Prior to participation in the trial, the subject or the subject's legally
acceptable representative should receive a copy of the signed and dated written
informed consent form and any other written information provided to the subjects. 
During a subject’s participation in the trial, the subject or the subject’s legally
acceptable representative should receive a copy of the signed and dated consent
form updates and a copy of any amendments to the written information provided
to subjects.
4.8.12  When a clinical trial (therapeutic or nontherapeutic) includes subjects who
can only be enrolled in the trial with the consent of the subject’s legally acceptable
representative (e.g., minors, or patients with severe dementia), the subject should
be informed about the trial to the extent compatible with the subject’s
understanding and, if capable, the subject should assent, sign and personally date
the written informed consent.
4.8.13  Except as described in 4.8.14, a nontherapeutic trial (i.e., a trial in which
there is no anticipated direct clinical benefit to the subject) should be conducted in
subjects who personally give consent and who sign and date the written informed
consent form.
4.8.14  Nontherapeutic trials may be conducted in subjects with consent of a
legally acceptable representative provided the following conditions are fulfilled:
(a)  The objectives of the trial cannot be met by means of a trial in subjects
who can give informed consent personally.
(b)  The foreseeable risks to the subjects are low.
(c)  The negative impact on the subject’s well-being is minimized and low.
(d)  The trial is not prohibited by law.
(e)  The approval/favorable opinion of the IRB/IEC is expressly sought on
the inclusion of such subjects, and the written approval/favorable opinion
covers this aspect. 
21Such trials, unless an exception is justified, should be conducted in patients having
a disease or condition for which the investigational product is intended.  Subjects
in these trials should be particularly closely monitored and should be withdrawn if
they appear to be unduly distressed.
4.8.15  In emergency situations, when prior consent of the subject is not possible,
the consent of the subject's legally acceptable representative, if present, should be
requested.  When prior consent of the subject is not possible, and the subject’s
legally acceptable representative is not available, enrollment of the subject should
require measures described in the protocol and/or elsewhere, with documented
approval/favorable opinion by the IRB/IEC, to protect the rights, safety, and well-
being of the subject and to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory
requirements.  The subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative should
be informed about the trial as soon as possible and consent to continue and other
consent as appropriate (see section 4.8.10) should be requested.
4.9 Records and Reports
4.9.1  The investigator should ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and
timeliness of the data reported to the sponsor in the CRFs and in all required
reports.
4.9.2  Data reported on the CRF, which are derived from source documents,
should be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies should be
explained.
4.9.3  Any change or correction to a CRF should be dated, initialed, and explained
(if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry (i.e., an audit trail should
be maintained); this applies to both written and electronic changes or corrections
(see section 5.18.4(n)).  Sponsors should provide guidance to investigators and/or
the investigators' designated representatives on making such corrections.  Sponsors
should have written procedures to assure that changes or corrections in CRFs
made by sponsor's designated representatives are documented, are necessary, and
are endorsed by the investigator.  The investigator should retain records of the
changes and corrections.
4.9.4  The investigator/institution should maintain the trial documents as specified
in Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial (see section 8.) and as
required by the applicable regulatory requirement(s).  The investigator/institution
should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these
documents.
224.9.5  Essential documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the last
approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no
pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 2
years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the
investigational product.  These documents should be retained for a longer period,
however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement
with the sponsor.  It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the
investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained
(see section 5.5.12).
4.9.6  The financial aspects of the trial should be documented in an agreement
between the sponsor and the investigator/institution.
4.9.7  Upon request of the monitor, auditor, IRB/IEC, or regulatory authority, the
investigator/institution should make available for direct access all requested trial-
related records. 
4.10 Progress Reports
4.10.1  Where required by the applicable regulatory requirements, the investigator
should submit written summaries of the trial’s status to the institution.  The
investigator/institution should submit written summaries of the status of the trial to
the IRB/IEC annually, or more frequently, if requested by the IRB/IEC.
4.10.2  The investigator should promptly provide written reports to the sponsor,
the IRB/IEC (see section 3.3.8), and, where required by the applicable regulatory
requirements, the institution on any changes significantly affecting the conduct of
the trial, and/or increasing the risk to subjects.
4.11 Safety Reporting
4.11.1  All serious adverse events (SAEs) should be reported immediately to the
sponsor except for those SAEs that the protocol or other document (e.g.,
Investigator's Brochure) identifies as not needing immediate reporting.  The
immediate reports should be followed promptly by detailed, written reports.  The
immediate and follow-up reports should identify subjects by unique code numbers
assigned to the trial subjects rather than by  the subjects' names, personal
identification numbers, and/or addresses.  The investigator should also comply
with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) related to the reporting of
unexpected serious adverse drug reactions to the regulatory authority(ies) and the
IRB/IEC.
234.11.2  Adverse events and/or laboratory abnormalities identified in the protocol as
critical to safety evaluations should be reported to the sponsor according to the
reporting requirements and within the time periods specified by the sponsor in the
protocol.
4.11.3  For reported deaths, the investigator should supply the sponsor and the
IRB/IEC with any additional requested information (e.g., autopsy reports and
terminal medical reports).
4.12 Premature Termination or Suspension of a Trial
If the trial is terminated prematurely or suspended for any reason, the
investigator/institution should promptly inform the trial subjects, should assure appropriate
therapy and follow-up for the subjects, and, where required by the applicable regulatory
requirement(s), should inform the regulatory authority(ies).  In addition:
4.12.1  If the investigator terminates or suspends a trial without prior agreement of
the sponsor, the investigator should inform the institution, where required by the
applicable regulatory requirements, and the investigator/institution should
promptly inform the sponsor and the IRB/IEC, and should provide the sponsor and
the IRB/IEC a detailed written explanation of the termination or suspension.
4.12.2  If the sponsor terminates or suspends a trial (see section 5.21), the
investigator should promptly inform the institution, where required by the
applicable regulatory requirements, and the investigator/institution should
promptly inform the IRB/IEC and provide the IRB/IEC a detailed written
explanation of the termination or suspension.
4.12.3  If the IRB/IEC terminates or suspends its approval/favorable opinion of a
trial (see sections 3.1.2 and 3.3.9), the investigator should inform the institution,
where required by the applicable regulatory requirements, and the
investigator/institution should promptly notify the sponsor and provide the sponsor
with a detailed written explanation of the termination or suspension.
4.13 Final Report(s) by Investigator/Institution
Upon completion of the trial, the investigator should, where required by the applicable
regulatory requirements, inform the institution, and the investigator/institution should
provide the sponsor with all required reports, the IRB/IEC with a summary of the trial’s
outcome, and the regulatory authority(ies) with any report(s) they require of the
investigator/institution.

Study Design  International, m ulti-center, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled, clinical worsening  study in subjects with 
PAH  receiving background oral monotherapy . 
Sample Size At least 6 10 subjects  with a maximum of 850 subjects will be 
enrolled  and randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either  
UT-15C or placebo . 
Summary of Subject  
Eligibility Criteria  Eligible su bjects must be 18 to 75 years of age  (inclusive)  at 
the time of signing informed consent , have a diagnosis of 
idiopathic or heritable PAH, PAH associated with  connective 
tissue disease (CTD ), PAH associated with repaired 
congenital systemic -to-pulmonary shunt ( at least one  year 
since repair) , PAH associ ated with  human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) infection, PAH associated with appetite 
suppressant or toxin use.  Eligible subjects may not have 
received a PGI 2 (except if used during acute vasoreactivity 
testing)  within 30 day s before randomization .  Subjects must 
be receiving only one PAH -approved oral therapy  for at least 
30 days prior  to randomization  and at a stable dose for a 
minimum of 10 days prior to  randomization .  The Baseline 
6MW D must be at least 150 meters . 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE- PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 8 Drug Dosage  
and Formulation  Background Regimen :  Every subject must have been 
receiving background mono therapy with one PAH -approved 
oral therapy for at least 30 days at randomization, and must 
have been receiving a stable dose for a minimum of 10 days  at 
randomization.   Once  randomized, subjects must remain on 
the same dose of background  oral PAH mono therapy  for the 
duration of the study.  In the event a subject must discontinue 
their background PAH oral therapy for any reason (e.g. AE), 
they must be switched to another agent  within the same class 
of medication, if available  and clinically appropriate  per the 
Investigator ’s discretion.  If no alternative therapy in the same 
class of medicatio n is available  and appropriate , the subject 
should  be switched to  a different class of approved oral PAH 
therapy.  
The minimum dose of oral PAH therapy used during the study 
must comply with the approved prescribing information for 
the product.  
Experimental Regimen :  All subjects will receive oral 
treprostinil (UT -15C) sustained release tablets or ma tching 
placebo.  Study drug may  be provided in 0.125, 0.25,  0.5, 1, 
and 2.5  mg sustained -release tablets to be administered three 
times (TID) daily.  The first dose of study drug (0.125 mg) 
should be taken by the subject at t he study site  within 
10 minutes of consuming food.  Oral dosing of study drug 
will then continue  at 0.125 mg TID (every 6  to 8 hours) with 
food.  Dose escalations can occur no more than every 
24 hours ( three  consecu tive doses) in 0.125 mg increments 
TID during the first four weeks of the study.  Following 
4 weeks of treatment, dose escalation may occur no more than 
every 24 hours in either 0.125 mg or 0.25  mg increments  TID.  
The maximum dose allowed will be  12 mg TID.  Note that 
sudden dose escalations or reductions may lead to intolerable 
adverse effects  or worsening of PAH , respectively,  and 
gradual dose titrations are recommended to reduce the risk to 
subjects .  Placebo will be identical in size, shape, and color to 
the respective active tablets.

 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 9 Procedures  Study Visit Schedule : Subjects will be assessed during 
Screening and Baseline visits to determine eligibility for the 
study.  Once randomized, subjects will return for visits every 
4 weeks for the first 12 weeks, then every 12 weeks for the 
duration of the study.  Subjects will continue in the study until 
they meet the definition of clinic al worsening or 
approximately 205 adjudicated clinical worsening events  have 
occurred.  If a subject cli nically worsens during the study and 
receives short -term (28 days or less) treatment with parenteral 
or inhaled PGI 2 therapy for treatment of PAH, they will be 
permitted  to enter the open -label extension study  
(TDE -PH-311).  If a subject discontinues the study for any 
reason other than clinical worsening, they will not be 
permitted to enter the open -label extension study.   Otherwise, 
all subjects  participating in the study  will have the 
opportunity to  transition to the open -label study once  
approximately 205 adjudicated clinical worsening events  have 
occurred . 
The following  efficacy and safety  assessments will occur  
during  the course of the study : 
Efficacy Assessments :  Clinical w orsening , exercise capacity 
(6MWD and Borg dyspnea s core) measured within 3  to 
6 hours  following the last dose of  study drug , WHO 
Functional Class , and NT-proBNP .  Optional assessments 
include hemodynamics , biomarker s, and pharmacogenomics . 
Safety Assessments :  AE reports, vital signs, clinical 
laboratory parameters, electrocardiograms (ECG ). 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE- PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 10 Statistical Considerations  Approximately 205 adjudicated  clinical worsening events  will 
provide at least  90% power with a  Type I error rate of 
0.05 (two-sided hypothesis) to detect a difference in the time 
to clinical worsening between treatment groups, assuming 
exponential distributions and an underlying hazard ratio of 
0.62.  Assuming a placebo median event time of 32  mont hs 
(which corresponds to an event rate of 23% at Month 12), this 
hazard ratio corresponds to a median time to event of 
51 months for the UT -15C group, or an event rate of 15% at 
Month 12.  If accrual of subjects is completed during the first 
three years an d 10% of the subjects drop out by the end of the 
study, a  total sample size of  at least 610 subjects  with a 
maximum of 850 subjects is expected to generate 
approximately 205 adjudicated events over the course of the  
study .  
The primary efficacy endpoint wi ll be tested at an interim 
analysis when 75% of total adjudicated events have occurred 
with an alpha spending of 0.020  and at the final analysis at an 
alpha of 0.044 with the overall Type I error rate at 0.05.  
Efficacy boundaries for early stopping of the  trial for efficacy 
is calculated based on O’Brien -Fleming alpha -spending 
function.

1.1 DEFINITION OF CLINICAL PROBLEM 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), defined as an elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure 
and pulmonary vascular resistance, is a severe hemodynamic abnormality common to a 
variety of diseases and syndromes.  Elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure causes an 
increase in right ventricular afterload, impairing right ventricular function and ultimately 
leading to heart failure and death. 
The typical etiologies of PAH include idiopathic, heritable or associated with collagen 
vascular/connective tissue disease, portal hypertension, infection with the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), history of cocaine inhalation and exposure to appetite 
suppre
ssant drugs.  An estimated annual incidence of approximately 2 cases per million has 
been reported for idiopathic PAH [Rich, 1987; Rubin 1997]. 
There are three major factors thought to contribute to the increased pulmonary vascular 
resistance seen in this disease: vasoconstriction, remodeling of the vessel wall, and 
thrombosis.  There are a number of metabolic pathways which contribute to these changes 
that involve vasoactive mediators such as the vasodilators nitric oxide and prostacyclin 
(PGI 2), and the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1.  These substances affect both vascular tone and 
remodeling leading to their use as pharmacologic targets [Farber, 2004]. 
Approved pharmacotherapies for PAH include: (1) intravenous PGI 2 (epoprostenol sodium or 
F
lolan®, Veletri®) ; (2) the PGI 2 analogues subcutaneous (SC), intravenous (IV), and inhaled

 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 16 efficacy for trials of investigational medicines in subjects with PAH.  However, recent 
literature has questioned the clinical relevance, variability, and sensitivity of the 6MWT as a 
primary endpoint to assess the efficacy of treatments for PAH.  Although the 6MWT is still 
view
ed as a valuable tool for measuring clinical efficacy of PAH therapies, a composite 
endpoint of ‘time to clinical worsening ’ is emerging as an alternative endpoint that allows for 
a
ssessment of long-term efficacy of investigational drugs for PAH [McLaughlin, 2009]. 
1.2
 TREPROSTINIL DIETHANOLAMINE BACKGROUND 
1.2.1 General Pharmacology 
Treprostinil, [[(1R,2R,3aS,9aS) 2,3,3a,4,9,9a hexahydro 2 hydroxy 1 [(3S) 3 hydroxyoctyl] 
1H benz [f]inden 5 yl]oxy]acetic acid, is a chemically stable tricyclic analogue of PGI 2. 
The pharmacology of treprostinil has been extensively characterized in well-established 
models, all confirming the suitability of the drug for the treatment of PAH following either 
the SC
, IV, inhaled (as treprostinil sodium) or oral (as treprostinil diethanolamine) routes of 
administration. 
The major pharmacological actions of treprostinil are direct vasodilation of pulmonary and 
systemic arterial vascular beds and inhibition of platelet aggregation.  In vitro, treprostinil 
induced concentration dependent relaxation of rabbit isolated precontracted mesenteric 
arteries, and inhibition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) induced platelet aggregation in 
human and rat platelet rich plasma.  In animals, the vasodilatory effects of treprostinil reduce 
right and left ventricular afterload, thereby increasing cardiac output and stroke volume.  
Prostacyclins lower pulmonary artery pressure, increase cardiac output without affecting the 
heart rate, improve systemic oxygen transport as well as possibly reversing pulmonary artery 
remodeling.  There is also increasing evidence that the ability to block the proliferation of 
pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells may contribute, along with vasodilation, to the 
therapeutic effects of PGI 2 in the treatment of PAH.  The mechanism of action is therefore 
li
kely to be multifactorial. 
Treprostinil diethanolamine (UT-15C) was selected from a series of treprostinil salts based on 
critical physicochemical characteristics (e.g., solubility, hygroscopicity, melting point) with a 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE- PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 17 goal of delivering treprostinil by the oral route as a sustained release (SR) dosage form. 
In solution, both treprostinil sodium and treprostinil diethanolamine are disassociated from 
their
 respective salt counter-ions and exist as the freely ionized form of treprostinil. As a 
result, the bioactive form present in the bloodstream is identical irrespective of the selection 
of the counter-ion. 
A r
at blood pressure model study confirmed that the diethanolamine salt of treprostinil 
exhibits dose dependent pharmacological activity with a cardiovascular profile comparable to 
that of treprostinil.  Overall, no highly active metabolite has been identified, as all the 
metabolites evaluated had greatly reduced activity compared to UT-15C.  Thus, it would 
appear that the observed pharmacological profile of UT-15C reflects the activity of the parent 
molecule, treprostinil, and that the contribution to that profile of any known metabolite that 
would be formed in vivo would be minimal. 
1.2.2 General Toxicology 
UT-15C is a novel salt form of Remodulin® (treprostinil) Injection and Tyvaso® (treprostinil) 
I
nhalation Solution, which are approved in the United States and other countries for the 
treatment of patients with PAH. The active pharmaceutical ingredient, treprostinil, exists as 
the sodium salt in the drug product of Remodulin and Tyvaso. Given that the only change to 
the drug substance synthesis route for UT-15C is the diethanolamine addition step, and 
treprostinil is not altered, the bioactive form of treprostinil diethanolamine and treprostinil 
sodium is predicted to be identical.  Therefore, in addition to the nonclinical studies 
conducted with UT-15C, an extensive amount of pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and 
toxicology information on treprostinil sodium is available from Remodulin and Tyvaso 
development. 
During the development of Remodulin, treprostinil sodium was administered SC and/or IV in 
acute toxicity studies, repeat-dose toxicity studies, reproductive toxicity studies, and 
genotoxicity studies, and has a well-defined clinical safety profile.  Treprostinil sodium was 
administered via continuous infusion to both rats and dogs in toxicity studies for up to 
6 months, which supported the chronic administration of Remodulin to patients.  
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE- PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 18 In addition to the extensive toxicology data with treprostinil sodium, the toxicity and 
toxicokinetic profiles of UT-15C have been evaluated in acute and repeat dose oral toxicity 
studies of up to 13 weeks in duration in rodents and up to 9 months duration in dogs.  UT-15C 
has also been evaluated in reproductive-developmental toxicity studies in pregnant rats and 
rabbits and in an in vivo rat micronucleus assay. 
Nonc
linical findings from 13 week toxicology studies with UT-15C have included dose 
dependent, yet transient decreases in mean body weight gain and food consumption in both 
rats and dogs and sof t/mucoid stools, diarrhea, and vomitus in dogs.  Many of these findings 
have been seen previously during development of Remodulin and are consistent with PGI 2-
induced effects.  In addition, post-mortem findings in rats administered UT-15C included 
changes in organ weight data and histological findings related to the adrenal gland, heart, 
spleen, thymus and bone marrow; some of which were not seen with Remodulin.  The 
majority of these findings were reversible following a 4-week recovery period.  Data from a 
9-month dog study provides additional toxicology information following chronic dosing.  
UT-
15C was reasonably well-tolerated following daily oral administration at dose levels up to 
35 mg/dog/day for 9 months.  The primary adverse effect was judged to be gastrointestinal 
dist
urbance, evidenced by increased incidence of soft stools, mucoid stools and diarrhea.  By 
the end of the study, all dogs were in good condition.  No systemic adverse effects were 
detected as judged by ophthalmology, ECG, clinical pathology and histopathological 
examination. 
In vitro genotoxicity studies with UT-15C have not been conducted; however, data are 
available for such studies using high doses of Remodulin (treprostinil sodium).  Remodulin 
(treprostinil sodium) was non-mutagenic in bacterial reverse mutation assays (Ames assay) at 
concentrations up to 5000 mcg/plate with and without S9 metabolic activation, and in the 
mous
e lymphoma assay at concentrations up to 400 mcg/mL without S9 metabolic activation 
and up to 300 mcg/mL in the presence of S9. 
UT-15C was tested in vivo in the rat micronucleus assay, which aimed to evaluate the 
potential of
 UT-15C to increase the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes 
in bone marrow of rats.  The results of the assay indicated that oral administration of UT-15C 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE- PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 19 at total doses up to and including a dose of 50 mg treprostinil (equivalent to 63.4 mg 
UT-15C/kg) did not induce a significant increase in the incidence of micronucleated 
polychromatic erythrocytes in either male or female SD rats.  Mortality observed at the high 
dose indicates systemic exposure of animals to the test article.  Based upon these findings, 
tre
prostinil diethanolamine (UT-15C) was concluded to be negative in the rat micronucleus 
assay. 
Segment I (rat) and Segment II (rat and rabbit) reproductive and developmental toxicology 
studies have also been conducted. No adverse effects for fetal viability/growth and fetal 
development (teratogenicity) were seen in rats at or below 20 mg/kg/day or rabbits at or 
below 0.5 mg/kg/day.  At high doses, there were teratogenic effects of UT-15C observed 
when administered to rabbits.  Findings included increased fetal incidence of external, soft 
ti
ssue, and skeletal malformations.  Additionally, a Segment III reproductive and 
de
velopmental toxicology study has been conducted in female rats.  F0 female rats receiving 
10 mg/kg/day had decreased food consumption and body weights during gestation, increased 
dura
tion of gestation, had slight decreases in the viability and number of pups per litter, and 
pups with decreased mean neonatal body weights.  F1 pups of females that received 
20 mg/kg/day had abnormalities in physical development (developmental landmarks), reflex 
de
velopment, exploratory behavior, learning and memory, and sexual maturation. 
A six month carcinogenicity study in hemizygous Tg.rasH2 mice administered UT-15C at 
daily oral doses of 3, 7.5, 15 mg/kg and 5, 10, 20 mg/kg in females and males, respectively, 
for 26 weeks did not increase the incidence of neoplastic lesions. A two year rat 
carcinogenicity study is ongoing. 
Studies have been conducted by the United States National Toxicology Program (NTP) to 
determine whether diethanolamine by itself (without treprostinil or any other drug) causes 
cancer.  Two years of topical administration of diethanolamine to mice produced an increased 
incidence (compared to a control group) of malignant liver tumors in males and females, as 
well as an increased incidence of malignant kidney tumors in males.  Doses used in this study 
were approximately 720 to 2900 times higher (based on mg/m2 dosing) than the proposed 
star
ting doses for the UT-15C clinical studies.  However, in transgenic mice and rats, topical 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE- PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 20 administration of diethanolamine for twenty weeks and two years, respectively, was not 
associated with the development of any cancers.  The relevance of the mouse tumor findings 
to humans is currently unknown.  Diethanolamine is listed on the FDA database of inactive 
ing
redients for a number of approved drug products with no apparent safety concerns. 
A Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) cardiovascular safety pharmacology study 
(Study 1259DU16.003) to evaluate diethanolamine effects, independent of treprostinil, on 
cardiovascular function in telemetered dogs was conducted.  Since there are 0.269 grams of 
diethanolamine per each gram of treprostinil in UT-15C, for this study, doses of 
diethanolamine were selected that were similar or higher than the amount of diethanolamine 
contained in the doses of UT-15C assessed in the UT-15C cardiovascular safety 
pharmacology study (Study 1259DU16.002).  Doses of 0, 2, 3, and 4 mg/kg/day of 
diethanolamine (equivalent to the amount of diethanolamine administered with 7, 11, and 
15 mg/kg/day of treprostinil, the free acid of UT-15C), were selected to be administered to 
e
ach of one group of four telemetered male dogs.  Data support that oral administration of 
diethanolamine at doses up to 2 mg/kg/dose twice daily (BID; 4 mg/kg/day) to male beagle 
dog
s was not associated with any definitive changes in arterial pressure, heart rate or 
electrocardiogram parameters.  In addition, no abnormal clinical signs were noted in the 
animals dosed with the vehicle or with any of the doses of diethanolamine. 
1.2.3 Clinical Pharmacology 
In solution, both treprostinil sodium and treprostinil diethanolamine are disassociated from 
their respective salt counter-ions and exist as the freely ionized form of treprostinil.  As a 
re
sult, the bioactive form present in the bloodstream is identical irrespective of the selection 
of the counter-ion. Given this premise, the development of this new diethanolamine salt of 
treprostinil is expected to retain the bioactivity and safety profile of treprostinil sodium. 
The most frequent adverse events (AE) associated with Remodulin in clinical trials of patients 
with PAH were related to the pharmacological properties of Remodulin and were generally 
not serious.  These PGI 2-related AEs included diarrhea, headache, and nausea.  Remodulin 
has not been associated with any significant changes in laboratory parameters or end-organ 
toxicity.  The safety profile noted in the open label extension study, with much longer 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE- PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 21 durations of exposure and a larger, more diverse patient population, was consistent with the 
profile noted in the controlled trials.  To date, well over 7000 subjects and patients have been 
exposed to Remodulin.  This number includes patients who have received single 
administration, to patients receiving continuous infusion for greater than 10 years. 
UT-15C has been administered to approximately 1800 subjects in Phase 1 to 3 clinical trials.  
UT-
15C doses of up to 3 mg BID have been administered to healthy volunteers and patients 
with PAH have received up to 27.5 mg three times daily (T ID)  in the ongoing Phase 2 to 
3 development program. The average exposure is approximately two years; the longest 
exposure
 is approximately seven years.  
The absolute bioavailability of the UT-15C 1 mg tablet is 17% compared with IV Remodulin.  
F
ollowing administration, treprostinil diethanolamine is widely distributed.  Treprostinil is 
approximately 96% protein bound with no effect on warfarin or digoxin displacement.  
P
harmacokinetic data (area under the curve; AUC) indicate that Day 1 pharmacokinetic data 
are predictive of Day 13 and linearity was observed in plasma exposure comparing 1 mg and 
2 mg doses in healthy volunteers.  Food, particularly a high calorie meal, has been observed to 
incr
ease absorption and prolong the systemic  exposure to treprostinil, contributing to the 
desired pharmacokinetic profile.  Consistent with  in vitro  studies, clinical studies assessing 
the impac
t of induction and inhibition of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 and CYP 2C9 
metabolic pathways on treprostinil diethanolamine indicate that CYP 2C8 appears to be of 
major importance and CYP 2C9 of minor importance to in vivo metabolism of UT-15C in 
humans.
 
To date, the majority of UT-15C studies have been conducted with BID dosing.  In an attempt 
to understand the pharmacokinetics of TID dosing a study was conducted in healthy 
volunteers.  In this open-label, single-center study 19 healthy subjects received 0.5 mg TID 
for
 7 days.  On the morning of Day 1 subjects received a single 0.5 mg dose, on Days 2 to 7 
the subjects received TID dosing of 0.5 mg (approximately 8AM, 2PM, and 8PM) with a 
meal.  On the morning of Day 8, the subjects received a final dose of 0.5 mg.

Nineteen subjects (9F: 10M) with a mean age of 35.2 years (range: 20 to 54) were enrolled.  
On Day 1 the mean (±SD) maximum plasma concentration (C max)  of treprostinil was 
0.574±0.22  ng/mL, occurring at a median time of 4 hours (range: 2 to 6 hrs).  In comparison, 
the Day 8 mean (±SD) C max was 0.615±0.32 ng/mL, occurring at a median time of 4 hours 
(r
ange: 1 to  6 hrs) ( F igure 1-1).

1.2.4 Efficacy and Safety Data 
UT-15C has previously been evaluated in three randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 
studi
es (TDE- PH- 301, TDE- PH-302, and TDE -PH-308).  Additionally, subjects completing 
these studies have been provided long-term access to UT-15C in an open-label extension 
stud
y (TDE- PH-304).  To date, over 1000 PAH patients have been exposed to study drug 
(UT-15C or placebo) in the TDE- PH-301, TDE- PH-302, and TDE- PH-308 studies and over 
890 patients have received UT-15C in the open-label extension study.

 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 24 TDE- PH-301 was a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international 
Phase 3 efficacy and safety study of treprostinil diethanolamine (UT-15C), in patients with 
P
AH.  Patients received UT-15C or placebo BID in combination with an ERA, a PDE5- I, or 
both. 
 The primary endpoint was placebo-corrected change in 6MWD from Baseline to 
W
eek 16.  Secondary endpoints included Borg dyspnea score, dyspnea-fatigue index, WHO 
F
unctional Class, and time to clinical worsening.  Study drug dose was titrated up to a 
maximum of 16 mg BID based on clinical response and study drug tolerability. 
Three-hundred fifty-four subjects were enrolled with 30% receiving an ERA alone, 25% a 
PDE5-I alone, and 45% both agents.  The population was 81% female, predominantly WHO 
F
unctional Class III (76%), and had a mean baseline 6MWD of 346 m.  PAH etiology 
included idiopathic or heritable PAH (66%), or PAH associated with CTD (26%), repaired 
c
ongenital systemic- to-pulmonary shunt (7%), or HIV infection (1%).  There were no 
remarkable demographic differences between treatment groups. 
Twenty-two percent of subjects discontinued UT-15C therapy compared to 14% in the 
placebo group.  The primary reason for discontinuation was AEs : 14%  in the UT-15C group 
compared to 5% in placebo.  There were three deaths in each of the treatment groups. 
The Hodges-Lehmann (H-L) estimate of 6MWD placebo corrected median change from 
baseline at Week 16 was +11 m (p=0.072). The change in 6MWD was significant at Week 12 
(
+13 m, p=0.015).  The lack of significance at Week 16 may be attributable to the number of 
subj
ects who did not provide an efficacy measure at Week 16 due to discontinuing from the 
stud
y prematurely. 
Secondary endpoints of the combined 6MWD and Borg dyspnea score and the dyspnea-
fatigue index demonstrated statistically significant changes at Week 16 for UT- 15C compared 
to Baseline (p=0.013 and 0.01, respectively). 
TD
E-PH-301 was initiated with subjects administered a 1 mg starting dose with dose 
increases in 1 mg increments.  Additional tablet strengths of 0.5 and 0.25 mg were made 
available to subjects at sequentially later times in the study.  A post-hoc analysis demonstrated 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE- PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 25 that during the course of the study those subjects with access to 0.25 mg tablets at 
randomization had a lower discontinuation rate due to AEs (0%, n=23) as well as a higher 
H-L estimate of 6MWD treatment effect (+28.5 m) at Week 16.  Presumably titrating up the 
dose
 of study drug slowly with smaller increments may allow subjects to tolerate and thereby 
maintain therapy on UT-15C and achieve optimal dosing.  In addition, those subjects that 
we
re able to titrate to doses between 1.25 and 3.25 mg BID and doses greater than or equal to 
3.5 mg BID also demonstrated a more robust treatment effect of +18 and +34 m, respectively.  
Thus, pr
emature discontinuations and inability to achieve doses greater than 1 mg BID during 
TD
E-PH-301 appear to have muted the overall treatment effect detected by the study. 
TDE- PH-302 was a 12-week, randomized (2:1 UT-15C to placebo), double-blind, placebo-
c
ontrolled, international Phase 3 efficacy and safety study of UT-15C in patients with PAH 
not currently receiving approved background therapy.  The primary endpoint was placebo 
corrected median change in 6MWD from Baseline to Week 12. Secondary endpoints included 
Borg dyspnea score, dyspnea-fatigue index, WHO Functional Class and time to clinical 
worsening.  Study drug dose was titrated up to a maximum of 12 mg BID based on clinical 
response and study drug tolerability. 
The study enrolled 349 subjects who were not receiving any approved PAH medication, with 
the population for primary analysis consisting of 228 subjects who had access to the 0.25 mg 
tablet strength at randomization.  These subjects were administered UT-15C or placebo BID, 
with the doses titrated to effect over the course of the 12-week study.  The majority of 
subjects were in WHO Functional Class II (33%) and class III (66%) of varied etiologies, 
including idiopathic or heritable PAH (75%), CVD associated PAH (19%), and PAH 
associated with HIV or other associated conditions (6%).  The subjects ’ mean Baseline 
6MWD was approximately 330 m. 
The
 primary efficacy analysis comparing change in 6MWD from Baseline to Week 12 
between treatment groups in the primary analysis population (n=228) was +23 m (p=0.0125, 
H
-L estimate).  The UT-15C group improved by a median of +25 m compared to -5 m change 
in the placebo group. 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE- PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 26 The combined 6MWD and Borg dyspnea score was also significantly improved (p=0.0497) at 
W
eek 12.  Preliminary analysis of other secondary efficacy measures, including change in 
troug
h 6MWD at Week 11, change in dyspnea fatigue index, change in Borg dyspnea score, 
change in WHO Functional Class, time to clinical worsening (as defined by death, 
transplantation, atrial septostomy, hospitalization due to PAH or at least a 20% decrease in 
6MWD and initiation of another approved PAH therapy), and PAH signs and symptoms at 
Week 12 did not differ significantly between the UT- 15C and placebo groups (p>0.05). 
An analysis of all 349 subjects enrolled in the study demonstrated that those subject s 
re
ceiving UT-15C improved their median 6MWD by approximately +25.5 m (H - L estimate, 
p=0.0001) as compared to subjects receiving placebo. 
AEs during the study included headache, nausea, diarrhea, and flushing, which were  expected 
in subjects receiving prostanoid therapy.  A low discontinuation rate due to AEs in the 
prima
ry analysis population and the type of AEs resulting in discontinuation (mostly PGI 2 
re
lated, which are not life threatening) indicate that use of UT- 15C may provide a significant 
im
provement in the safety profile of treprostinil and result in a reduction in the occurrence of 
life-threatening AEs compared with parenteral treprostinil therapy (e.g., central venous 
catheter-related blood stream infection ). 
TDE- PH-308 was a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international 
P
hase 3 efficacy and safety study of UT-15C in patients with PAH.  Patients received UT-15C 
or placebo BID in combination with either an ERA, a PDE5-I, or both.  The primary endpoint 
was placebo-corrected change in 6MWD from Baseline to Week 16.  Secondary endpoints 
included Borg dyspnea score, dyspnea-fatigue index, WHO Functional Class and time to 
clinical worsening.  Study drug dose was titrated up to a maximum of 16 mg BID based on 
clinical response and study drug tolerability. 
Three-hundred-ten subjects (157 UT-15C and 153 placebo) were randomized, received a dose 
of study drug, and contributed to the analysis population for the study.  The study population 
ha
d a mean age of 51 years (range 18 to 76 years), was 78% female and had a diagnosis of 
idi
opathic or heritable PAH (65%), PAH related to CVD (31%), PAH related to HIV infection 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE- PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 27 (2%), or PAH related to repaired systemic- to-pulmonary shunts (1%).  The population was 
pre
dominantly WHO Functional Class III (73%) with a mean Baseline 6MWD of 333 m.  As 
for PAH-approved background therapy, 53 (17%) subjects were receiving ERA therapy alone, 
132 (43%) subjects were receiving a PDE5-I alone, and 125 (40%) subjects were receiving 
the combination of an ERA and a PDE5-I at Baseline.  The UT -15C and placebo groups were 
well balanced across all Baseline indices. 
The primary efficacy analysis comparing change in 6MWD from Baseline to W eek 16 
be
tween treatment groups was +10 m (H-L estimate; p=0.089).  The UT -15C group improved 
by a median of +15 m compared to a +11 m median change in the placebo group.  Placebo-
corrected changes from Baseline in 6MWD at Week 16 by PAH-approved background 
therapy were as follows: ERA only (H-L estimate of treatment effect = +7.7 m; p=0.739), 
PDE5-I only (H- L estimate = +15.0 m; p=0.054), and combination ERA and PDE5-I (H- L 
e
stimate = +4.0 m; p=0.674).  The mean ± SD maximum dose of UT-15C was 3.1±1.9 mg 
B
ID in the UT-15C group as compared to 6.1±3.6 mg BID in the placebo group.  Secondar y 
e
ndpoints including change in 6MWD at Weeks 4, 8, and 12, combined 6MWD and Borg 
dyspnea score, dyspnea-fatigue index, clinical worsening, serum NT-proBNP, WHO 
Functional Class, quality of life, and symptoms of PAH at Week 16 were not found to be 
statistically significant. 
TD
E-PH-304 is a long-term, open-label, international, Phase 3 study designed to provide 
access to UT-15C for subjects previously enrolled in studies TDE- PH- 301, TDE- PH-302, 
TDE- PH-308, or other specified studies conducted during the UT-15C development program.  
Secondary objectives of the study are to assess the long-term safety of UT-15C in PAH 
patients and to assess the effect of continued therapy on exercise capacity via 6MWD 
following one year of treatment with UT - 15C.  As of 01 September 2015, over 896 subjects 
were enrolled, representing 2377.7 patient-years of exposure.  The mean and maximum 
dura
tion of exposure was 138.8  and 444.9 weeks (2.66 and 8.53  years), respectively.  Th e 
mean dose of oral treprostinil achieved was 3.9, 4.5, 4.8, 5.0, 5.5, 5.9, and 5.9 mg BID at 
1 year (N=605), 2 years (N=472), 3 years (N=337), 4 years (N=230), 5 years (N=119), 6 years 
(N
=77), and 7 years (N=37), respectively.  AEs were typical of PGI 2 therapy; laboratory

term treatment with UT-15C.  Following 12 months of oral treprostinil treatment, the mean 
6M
WD increased by +2 5 meters as compared with Baseline.  Kaplan- Mei er analysis of 
subject survival demonstrated 1-, 2-, and 3-y ea r survival estimates of approximately 93.6%, 
87.9%,  and 82.2%, respectivel y. 
1.3
 RATIONALE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF STUDY DRUG IN PAH 
Prostacyclin is a potent endogenous vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation.  A 
synthetic salt of PGI 2 (i.e., Flolan) has been previously shown to prolong survival in patients 
with P
AH [Barst 1996].  However, due to its very short half-life and chemical instability, 
Flolan has to be continuously infused by intravenous delivery.  Treprostinil sodium is a 
chemically stable, longer acting analogue that has shown clinical effectiveness when 
administered by subcutaneous, intravenous (Remodulin) [Remodulin package insert, 2013], or 
inhale
d routes (Tyvaso) [Tyvaso package insert, 2013]. 
P
arenteral PGI 2 are considered by many providers as the “gold standard” for treatment of 
P
AH; however, they are typically used later in the course of the disease due to the risks and 
diff
iculties associated with administration.  Consequently, physicians managing patients with 
PAH commonly initiate oral monotherapy, to allow patients to benefit from the simplicity of 
a
n oral dosage form. 
Effective treatment of PAH often requires combination therapy with several drugs.  Current 
guidelines suggest that if patients in WHO Functional Classes II, III, or IV do not demonstrate 
improvement, sequential combination therapy with several PAH-specific drugs is appropriate 
[Barst 2009].  Several studies have previously demonstrated a benefit of sequential 
combination therapy, particularly when combining PGI 2 treatment with other PAH-specific 
tre
atments.  The STEP-1 study evaluated the efficacy of iloprost and bosentan combination 
therapy over 12 weeks, resulting in a near significant increase in 6MWD (p=0.051) after 
il
oprost inhalation (McLaughlin et al., 2006).  The PACES study demonstrated improvements 
in exercise capacity and hemodynamic parameters when sildenafil and intravenous 
epoprostenol were used in combination (Simonneau et al., 2008).  The TRIUMPH-I study 
e
valuated the efficacy of inhaled treprostinil (Tyvaso®) c ompared with placebo in patients 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE- PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 29 already receiving treatment with either bosentan or sildenafil and found a statistically 
sig
nificant increase in 6MWD at peak and trough treprostinil exposure (p<0.0006 and p<0.01, 
respectively) (McLaughlin et al., 2010).  An innovative salt form, treprostinil diethanolamine, 
ha
s been developed to deliver PGI 2 therapy via the oral route in a solid dosage form.  Because 
the bioactive species is the same, treprostinil diethanolamine is expected to retain a similar 
safety and efficacy profile as parenteral treprostinil sodium in the convenience of an oral 
dosage form.  It has been suggested combination therapy, particularly with a PGI 2, ma y 
prevent or delay the progression of the disease and thereby prolong the time to clinical 
worsening. 
1.4 CLINICAL HYPOTHESIS 
The
 hypothesis of this study is that treatment with oral UT-15C combined with 
P
AH-approved oral monotherapy as compared with placebo with PAH-approved oral 
monotherapy will: 
 D elay time to first clinical worsening (morbidity or mortality) event  
The
 hypothesis for the change of dosing frequency from BID to TID is that delivering more 
sustained concentrations of treprostinil may allow for systemic exposure to drug that more 
closely resembles the approved parenteral product, Remodulin, and reduce the occurrence of 
PGI 2 AEs pre viously seen with the BID regimen.  Both of these improvements may allow 
study subjects to titrate to a more effective UT-15C dose and thus study drug may show a 
clinically and statistically significant difference compared to placebo in delaying time to first 
clinical worsening. 
2 OB JECTIVES 
2.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE 
The
 primary objective of this study is: 
To assess the effect of oral UT-15C with PAH-approved oral monotherapy compared to

 Non -elective hospitalization lasting at least 24 hours in duration caused by clinical 
conditions directly related to PAH and/or right heart failure; or 
 Lung or heart/lung transplantation; or 
 A trial septostomy 
 I nitiation of an inhaled or infused PGI 2 for the treatment of worsening PAH 
 Disease progression (all criteria required):

3 E XPERIMENTAL PLAN 
3.1 STUDY DESIGN 
This is an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event 
driven study in subjects with PAH.  Subjects will be assessed during the Screening period to 
determine eligibility for the study, which will be confirmed during the Baseline visit prior to 
randomization.  Once randomized, subjects will return for study visits every 4 weeks for the 
first 12 weeks, then every 12 weeks for the duration of the study.  Subjects will continue in 
the study until either they experience clinical worsening as defined in the protocol, 
approximately 205 adjudicated events have occurred, or they premature ly discontinue 
pa
rticipation in the study for any reason other than protocol-specifi c clinical worsening.  If a 
subject meets the definition of clinical worsening during the study and receives only short 
term (28 days or less) treatment with an infused or inhaled PGI 2 therapy for worsening PAH, 
they will be permitted to enter the open-label extension study (TDE- PH-311).  If a subject 
prematurely discontinues the study for any reason other than clinical worsening, or receives 
long-term (29 days or more) treatment with an infused or inhaled PGI 2 therapy for worsening 
P
AH, they will not be permitted to enter the open-label extension study.  Otherwise, all 
subj
ects actively participating in the study will be allowed to transition to the open-label 
e
xtension study after approximately 205 adjudicated clinical worsening events have occurred. 
At each scheduled visit, subjects will undergo the following efficacy assessments: clinical 
worse
ning, exercise capacity (6MWD and Borg dyspnea score), and WHO Functional Class.  
P
lasma samples will also be collected for measurement of NT-proBNP at Baseline, Week 12 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE- PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 32 Week 24, Continued Visit 1 and at every other Continued Visit thereafter.  See Ta ble 3-1 for 
the overall schedule of times and events. 
Additionally, subjects may participate in an optional hemodynamic sub-study in which 
hemodynamic parameters will be assessed by RHC before randomization and following 
24 weeks of treatment with study drug. 
S
afety will be a ssessed via vital signs,  AEs, and clinical laboratory parameters.  Subjects will 
also undergo a 12-lead ECG at Screening and Week 24.  At every protocol-required visit, 
m
easures of exercise capacity will occur within 3 to 6 hours following administration of the 
last dose of
 study drug. 
S
ubjects must receive only one PAH-approved oral therapy at a dose  that complies with the 
approved prescribing information for the product for at least 30 days before the day of 
randomization to participate in the study.  The dose of background oral monotherapy may be 
ti
trated as clinically indicated during the Screening period.  Subjects must be on a stable dose 
of the ir background oral monotherapy for a minimum of 10 days prior to being randomly 
a
llocated to receive either oral UT- 15C or placebo at randomization.  Subjects will receive 
their first dose of study drug (0.125 mg) in the clinic on the day of randomization.  Oral 
dosi
ng of study drug will be continued at 0.125 mg TID (every 6 to 8 hours) with food.  The 
dose
 will be slowly titrated throughout the study up to a maximum dose of 12 mg TID in an 
e
ffort to reach a well-tolerated dose that provides optimal clinical benefit.

titration), either because the subject has met clinical worsening criteria or is being permanently discontinued from the 310 study. The 6MWD should be conducted within 
3 to 6 hours after the most recent dose of study medication and preferably before the drug is down titrated (if the subject is being permanently discontinued rather than 
transitioning to the TDE- PH-311 study) 
m If subject permanently discontinues study drug before Week 24 and is ineligible for the TDE- PH-311 study, subject should be encouraged to remain in study and attend 
visits up to and including Week 24 . The end of study assessments (survival status, AE assessment, drug accountability, concomitant medications, etc .) should be 
conducted after the subject has stopped taking the study medication (before or at Week 24)

3.2.1 Efficacy 
3.2.1.1  Clinical Worsening 
Clinical worsening will be assessed continuously from randomization until the subject’s  last 
study visit.  All clinical worsening events will be reviewed by the sponsor Medical Monitors.  To 
ensure subject eligibility for the open-label extension study (TDE- PH- 311), subjects should 
remain on study drug until the clinical worsening event has been reviewed and confirmed by the 
Medical Monitor unless the Investigator feels it is medically necessary to discontinue study drug 
for the welfare of the subject.  Clinical worsening (adjudicated) is defined as the occurrence of 
any one of the following clinical worsening (morbidity or mortality) events: 
 Death (all causes) 
 Hospitalization due to worsening PAH defined as: 
 Non -elective hospitalization lasting at least 24 hours in duration caused by clinical 
conditions directly related to PAH and/or right heart failure; or 
 Lung or heart/lung transplantation; or 
 Atria l septostomy 
 Initiation of an inhaled or infused PGI 2 for the treatment of worsening PAH 
 Dise ase progression (all criteria required): 
 A de crease in 6MWD of at least 15% from Baseline (or too ill to walk) directly 
related to PAH progression with other co-morbidities ruled out, confirmed by two 
6MWTs performed on different days* 
 W orsening of PAH symptoms, which must include either 
 An increase in functional class from Baseline or 
 Appearance or worsening of symptoms of right heart failure since Baseline 
 Unsa tisfactory long-term clinical response (all criteria required) 
 Randomized to receive study drug for at least 24 weeks 
 A de crease from Baseline in 6MWD at Week 24 and beyond at two consecutive visits 
on different days* 
 Sustained WHO Functional Class III or IV symptoms for at least 24 weeks 
consecutively 
*Confirmatory 6MWTs should be conducted within 30 days of the qualifying decrease in 
6MWD; however, confirmatory 6MWTs occurring outside of this window will still be 
considered to have met the definition of clinical worsening and sent to the adjudication 
committee for review. 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 36  Once a clinical worsening event occurs, it must be entered on the specified form in the electronic 
case report form (eCRF) and should be submitted within 48 hours after the event becomes 
known to the 
Investigator or designee.  When the form is submitted, the sponsor Medical 
Moni
tor will review the event and correspond with the Investigator and site, as appropriate.  
Althoug
h subjects may be discontinued from the study for medical necessity at any time, 
subjects should not be discontinued for a clinical worsening event until the event has been 
reviewed by the Medical Monitor.  Once the clinical worsening event has occurred, the subjec t 
will then complete the Study Dr ug Termination visit assessments. 
C
linical worsening events that meet the definition of a serious adverse event (SAE) will follow 
the same reporting requirements as all SAEs (Section 9.3).  These events must also be entered on 
the 
specified form in the eCRF. 
In addition to the Medical Monitor reviewing all clinical worsening events as and when they 
occur, an independent adjudication committee will review all clinical worsening events 
pe
riodically throughout the study (Section 10.8).  
3.2.1.2  Six-Minute Walk Test 
The intent of the 6MWT is to evaluate exercise capacity associated with carrying out activities of 
daily living.  All 6MWTs will be conducted by qualified, trained personnel in a designated 
6MW
T area which meets the requirements as described in Section 15.1.  Prior to the start of each 
6MW
T the subject should rest (seated) for at least 5 minutes. 
3.2.1.2.1 Practice Six Minute Walk Test 
All subjects must have a documented 6MWT conducted at the study site on the course intended 
for use during the study.  If no previous 6MWT has been performed at the study site, a practice 
6MWT must be conducted at least 1 day prior to the Randomization 6MWT for applicable 
subjects. 
3.2.1.2.2 Baseline Six Minute Walk Test 
A B
aseline 6MWT must be performed prior to initiation of study drug and should be conducted 
on the 
day of randomization.  The Baseline 6MWT must be conducted no earlier than 1 day 
following the practice 6MWT, for applicable subjects.  Once the Baseline 6MWT has been 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 37  conducted, the site will enter the subject’s six-minute walk distance into an interactive voice or 
we
b response system (IVRS/IWRS).  IVRS/IWRS will confirm to  site personnel the subject’s 
e
ligibility to participate in the study based on 6MWD, and if eligible, randomize the subject into 
a
 treatment group and allocate appropriate study drug. 
3.2.1.2.3 Treatment Six-Minute Walk Tests 
6MWTs will be conducted at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, and every 12 weeks thereafter.  The 6MWT 
shoul
d be conducted 3 to 6 hours following the last dose of study medication.  Subjects receiving 
supplemental oxygen during the Baseline 6MWT must continue to receive the same flow rate 
a
nd mode of oxygen therapy at all subsequent 6MWT assessments; any changes in oxygen 
ther
apy administration should be noted in the e CRF .  In addition, subjects receiving pulmonary 
re
habilitation prior to study entry should continue on the same schedule up to and including 
Week 24.  Following Week 24, pulmonary rehabilitation may be adjusted per standard of care.  
Pulmonary rehabilitation m ay not be added to a subject’s regimen  between randomization and 
W
eek 24.  Documentation of pulmonary rehabilitation should occur in the special circumstances 
section of the eCRF.  Additional 6MWTs may be conducted as appropriate throughout the course 
of the study for the purposes of evaluating clinical worsening status. 
Each 6MWT conducted after Randomization should be documented and compared to the 
subject’s Baseline 6MWD.  If a subject has a decrease of 15% or more in walk distance 
compared to Baseline, a second confirmatory 6MWT should be performed on a different day to 
a
ssess for clinical worsening (confirmatory 6MWTs should be conducted within 30 days of the 
qualifying decrease in 6MWD; however, confirmatory 6MWTs occurring outside of this window 
will
 still be considered to have met the definition of clinical worsening and sent to the 
adjudication committee for review).  If the second 6MWT also shows at least 15% decrease in 
6MWD as compared to Baseline and the subject has either worsened in WHO Functional Class 
c
ompared to Baseline or has the appearance or worsening of symptoms of right heart failure 
since Baseline, the subject will meet the ‘disease progression ’ definition of clinical worsening 
a
nd should follow steps as outlined in Section 3.2.1.1 .  Prior to exiting the study, the Study Drug 
Termination visit assessments should be conducted at the time the decision is made to 
discontinue study drug (prior to down titration).  For subjects who meet the definition of clinical 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 38  worsening for disease progression due to at least a 15% decrease in 6MWD from Baseline, the 
da
te of the clinical worsening event will be the date of the second confirmatory 6MWT. 
After the first 24 weeks of study participation, if a subject has any two consecutive 6MWTs on 
different days that demonstrate any decrease in 6MWD from Baseline accompanied with 
sustained WHO Functional Class III or IV symptoms for at least 24 weeks, consecutively, the 
subj
ect will meet the clinical worsening definition of unsatisfactory long-term clinical response 
a
nd should follow steps outlined in Section 3.2.1.1. 
De
tails regarding the conduct of the 6MWT are described in Section 15.1. 
3.2.1.3  Borg Dyspnea Score 
The Borg dyspnea score will be assessed following each 6MWT.  The Borg dyspnea score is a 
10-point scale rating the maximum level of dyspnea experienced during the 6MWT 
(Se
ction 15.1).   Scores range from 0 (for the best condition) to 10 (for the worst condition). 
3.2.1.4  WHO Functional Classification 
The WHO functional classification for PAH (Section 15.2) will be assessed at Baseline prior to 
starting study drug and at all subsequent scheduled study visits, and every time the 6MWT is 
performed for purposes of assessing clinical worsening status.  
3.2.1.5  N-terminal pro-BNP 
Plasma NT -proBNP concentration is a useful biomarker for PAH as it is associated with changes 
in right heart morphology and function [Fijalkowska 2006].  NT-proBNP sample collection will 
occur at Baseline (prior to starting study drug), Week 12, Week 24, the first Continued Visit, and 
e
very other Continued Visit thereafter (i.e., Continued Visits #3, #5, #7, etc.).  NT-proBNP will 
a
lso be assessed at the Study Drug Termination visit. 
3.2.1.6  Right Heart Catheterization (Optional Assessment) 
This section describes the optional RHC assessments that may be conducted at Baseline and 
Week 24.  
If a subject agrees to participate in the optional hemodynamic assessments, a RHC must be 
performed within 5 days before randomization (inclusive).  The subject must be on stable 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 39  background therapy for a minimum of 10 days prior to th is RHC.  If a RHC is performed on the 
da
y of randomization, all other study-related assessments, other than initiation of study drug, 
should be performed prior to conduct of the RHC.  A follow-up RHC must be performed within 
72 hours following completion of Week 24 assessments.  As best as possible, follow-up RHC 
should be performed within 3 to 6 hours of previous dose.  Hemodynamic parameters to be 
a
ssessed and recorded include heart rate (HR), systolic systemic arterial pressure (SAPs), 
diastolic systemic arterial pressure (SAPd), mean systemic arterial pressure (SAPm), systolic 
pulmonary artery pressure (PAPs), diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAPd), mean pulmonary 
a
rtery pressure (PAPm), mean right atrial pressure (RAPm), mean pulmonary capillary wedge 
pre
ssure (PCWPm), cardiac output (CO ) , arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2), and mixed venous 
oxygen saturation (SvO 2).  Additional hemodynamic parameters may also be calculated based on 
these
 measurements (e.g., pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR] and cardiac index [CI]).  Weight 
a
nd height will be collected to calculate body surface area (BSA) and index the cardiac output. 
W
hile this section describes the optional RHC assessments at Baseline and Week 24, all subjects 
e
ligible to participate in this study must either have data available from a historical RHC 
conducted within three years prior to the start of screening (i.e., date of signing the Informed 
C
onsent Form [ICF]), or undergo a RHC during the screening period prior to randomization with 
results consistent with the diagnosis of PAH as described in Section 4.1. 
3.2.1.7  Optional Biomarker 
For subjects consenting to the optional biomarker samples, blood and urine will be collected at 
the End of Study Visit for the evaluation of biomarkers.  These samples will be shipped to the 
central laboratory for processing and storage prior to analysis.  Subjects who do not wish to 
participate in the optional biomarker research may still participate in the clinical study. 
3.2.1.8  Optional Pharmacogenomic 
For subjects consenting to pharmacogenomic analysis, blood samples will be collected at the 
End of Study Visit for pharmacogenomics analyses.  These samples will be shipped to the central 
labor
atory for processing and storage prior to analysis.  Genetic variants and/or gene expression 
patterns will be analyzed to evaluate their association with observed clinical response and 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 40  tolerability to prostacyclin therapy.  Subjects who do not wish to participate in the optional 
pha
rmacogenomic research may still participate in the clinical study. 
3.2.2 Safety   
3.2.2.1  Medical History and Physical Examinations 
A complete medical history, demographics, PAH history, and physical examination will be 
conducted during the Screening period.  Significant past or present illnesses, current prescription 
or no
nprescription medications (including vitamins and herbal products), and history of allergies 
or idios
yncratic responses to drugs should be noted in the eCRF.  Any significant changes to the 
subject ’s medical condition, physical examination, and concomitant medications must be 
documented throughout the course of the study.  A complete physical examination will be 
c
onducted at the Study Drug Termination Visit. 
3.2.2.2  Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Clinical laboratory tests will be assessed at the Screening and Baseline visits prior to starting 
study drug.  Screening and Baseline clinical laboratory assessments can be combined into a 
sing
le blood draw if all eligibility criteria are met within 48 hours prior to randomization.  
C
entral laboratory data are ultimately used to qualify patients for th e study.  However, for 
patients who are well known to the Investigator and who are clinically stable, the Investigator 
may choose not to delay randomization while waiting for central laboratory confirmation of local 
laboratory values.  Clinical laboratory assessments will also be assessed at Weeks 12 and 24, at 
the f
irst Continued Visit, and every other Continued Visit thereafter (i.e., Continued Visits #3, 
#5, #7, etc.) as displayed in Appendix 15.3.  Clinical laboratory tests will also be assessed at the 
S
tudy Drug Termination visit. 
A urine pregnancy test will be collected at Screening, Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, every 
12 weeks thereafter, and at the Study Drug Termination Visit for women of child bearing 
potential (WOCBP).  Screening and Baseline urine pregnancy tests can be combined into a 
sing
le test if all eligibility criteria are met within 48 hours prior to randomization.

 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 41  3.2.2.3  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be assessed at Screening and Baseline prior to starting study medication and at 
Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24.  After Week 24, vital signs will be assessed every 12 weeks and at the 
S
tudy Drug Termination Visit.  All vital signs will be collected prior to or at least 30 minutes 
following
 the corresponding 6MWT.  Vital signs include blood pressure, peripheral 
(r
adial/brachial artery) heart rate, respiration rate, and weight.  Height will be collected at the 
B
aseline visit.  Vital signs must be collected following at least 5 minutes of rest (or at least 
30 minutes after a 6MWT) to ensure accurate measurement. 
3.2.2.4  Adverse Events 
AEs will be captured from the time the ICF is signed.  All AEs should be followed until either 
resolution (or return to normal or Baseline values), until they are judged by the Investigator to no 
longer be clinically significant, or for up to 30 days if the AE extends beyond the final visit.  All 
SAEs should be followed until resolution, death, or the subject is lost to follow-up even if they 
a
re ongoing more than 30 days after completion of the final visit.  Sections 9 and 15.4 provide 
the guidelines and definitions for recording AEs. 
Symptoms of PAH (disease related events) should only be recorded as an AE if the event is 
either serious, new, or unusual with respect to intensity, frequency, duration as compared to 
symptoms in the subject’s medical history; or there is a reasonable possibility that the event was 
caused by the study drug. 
3.2.2.5  12-Lead ECG 
Twelve-lead ECGs will be recorded after at least 5 minutes rest in the semi-recumbent position 
at Screening, Week 24, and at the Study Drug Termination Visit.  Recordings should include 
lead II as a rhythm strip and contain at least five QRS complexes.  ECG parameters collected 
include heart rate, PR interval, QT interval, QRS duration, and any clinically significant 
a
bnormalities. 
3.3 NU MBER OF  CENTERS 
The study is an international multi-center study with approximately 150 centers participating. 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 42  3.4 NU MBER OF SUBJECTS 
At least 610 subjects with a maximum of 850 subjects will be randomized (1:1 UT-15C : 
placebo) across all sites participating in the study in order to obtain the required number of 
adjudicated clinical worsening (morbidity and mortality) events. 
3.5 E STIMATED STUDY DURATION 
Subjects will remain in the study until they either experience a clinical worsening event, 
discontinue the study for any other reason, or approximately 20 5 adjudicated clinical worsening 
events have occurred.  It is estimated that the overall study duration will last for 4 years; 
howe
ver, this is dependent on the rate of clinical worsening events. 
Subjects that discontinue and do not roll into the open-label extension study (TDE- PH-311) will 
be contacted approximately 30 days (±5 days) after study drug discontinuation to confirm their 
surviva
l status.  Subjects that complete TDE- PH- 310 and roll in to the open-label extension 
stud
y will also be contacted approximately 30 days (±5 days) after study drug discontinuation in 
study TDE- PH-310 to confirm their survival status. 
S
ubjects may also continue to be contacted after the final study visit to assess ongoing 
AEs/SAEs (see Section 9.2 for additional details). 
4 S UBJECT ELIGIBILITY 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are to be assessed during the Screening period and reconfirmed 
a
t the Baseline visit prior to randomization.  If necessary, certain procedures may be conducted

accurate assessment of the subject’s exercise capacity.  
8. The  subject must be optimally treated with conventional pulmonary hypertension therapy 
(e
.g., oral vasodilators, oxygen, digoxin, diuretics, anticoagulants as deemed appropriate 
b
y the Investigator) with no additions, discontinuations, or dose changes for a minimum

4.3.1 PAH -Approved Therapies 
All subjects must be re ceiving a dose of one PAH-approved oral therapy that complies with the 
approved prescribing information (as described i n Ta ble 4-1) for the product for a minimum of 
30 days and at the current dose for at least 10 days prior to randomization.  All subjects must be 
will
ing to remain on the same background approved PAH oral therapy at the same dose for the 
duration of the study.  In the event a subject must undergo a change in background therapy, they 
should be switched to another approved agent in the same medication class if possible.  If 
another agent in the same class is not available, the subject should be switched to an agent from 
another
 class of approved PAH oral medications.  If no alternative therapy is available, the 
subj
ect will continue in the study until either a clinical worsening event has occurred, the subject 
withdraws from the study, or the study is completed/discontinued.

** 20 mg once daily is permitted if used per prescribing guidelines (e.g., subject has mild or moderate renal insufficiency) 
*** 0.5 mg three times daily permitted if used per prescribing guidelines (e.g. subject cannot tolerate hypotensive effects) 
Prior to Week 24, if the Investigator, for any reason, initiates a second PAH-approved oral 
therapy in addition to the PAH-approved oral therapy initiated prior to Screening (e.g., due to 
disease progression without meeting the definition of clinical worsening as defined in 
Section 2.1), the subject must be discontinued from the study drug.  The subject should be 
e
ncouraged to remain in the study and attend all visits up to and including Week 24; however, 
the subje
ct will not be eligible for enrollment in the open-label study (TDE- PH- 311).  After 
Week 24, if the Investigator initiates a second PAH-approved oral therapy due to any reason in 
addition to the PAH-approved oral therapy initiated prior to Screening, the subject must be 
discontinued from the study and will not be eligible for enrollment in the open-label stu dy. 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 47  All changes in drug or dosage regimens during the study will be recorded in the subject’s source 
documents and transcribed as required to the eCRF. 
Product labeling for the background PAH-approved oral therapy should be consulted in order to 
guide the monitoring of AEs.  The dose of study drug should be adjusted first in response to any 
new AEs that occur during the study, rather than adjusting the dose of PAH-approved oral 
ther
apy; unless the event is considered causally related to the PAH-approved oral therapy.  If a 
subj
ect meets the definition of clinical worsening during the study and receives only short term 
(28 days or less) treatment with an infused or inhaled PGI 2 therapy for worsening PAH, they will 
be
 permitted to enter the open-label extension study (TDE- PH-311).  If a subject prematurely 
discontinues the study for any reason other than clinical worsening, or receives long-term 
(29 days or more) treatment with an infused or inhaled PGI 2 therapy for worsening PAH, they 
will
 not be permitted to enter the open- label extension study.  During the course of the study, if 
the Investigator initiates a second PAH-approved oral therapy due to any reason (e.g. disease 
progression without meeting the definition of clinical worsening as defined in Section 2.1) in 
a
ddition to the PAH-approved oral therapy initiated prior to Screening, the subject must be 
discontinued from the study and will not be eligible for enrollment in the open-label study 
(TDE- PH-311). 
4.3.2 Concomitant Medications 
All subjects must have been stabilized on optimal doses of conventional PAH therapies (e.g., 
oral vasodilators, digoxin, diuretics, oxygen, anticoagulants) for at least 10 days prior to Baseline 
assessments.  The exceptions are the discontinuation or dose changes of anticoagulants and/or 
dose change of diuretics.  After randomization, additions, deletions, and dose changes may occur 
if the
 Investigator determines it is medically necessary.  For the purposes of the 6MWT, if the 
subject was assessed at Baseline using oxygen therapy then all future 6MWTs during the study 
must be conducted with the same oxygen flow rate and mode of administration ; any changes in 
oxygen therapy administration should be noted in the e CRF . 
All concomitant medications taken during conduct of the study, including those taken for AEs or 
other medical events, should be recorded in the subject’s source documents and transcr ib ed as 
required to the eCRF.

Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 48  5 S UBJECT ENROLLMENT 
5.1 T REATMENT ASSIGNMENT 
Eligible subjects will be randomly allocated to receive either UT-15C or placebo at 
randomization.  During the Screening period a screening number will be assigned using an 
electronic data capture (EDC) system to identify individual subject data until the subject is 
ra
ndomized.  Upon randomization, each subject will be assigned a new unique study subject 
number
 via the IVRS/IWRS.  The IVRS/IWRS will also be responsible for allocation of all study 
drug. 
5.2 RA NDOMIZATION 
The study will be randomized 1:1 UT-15C to placebo.  All subjects will be randomly allocated to 
receive UT - 15C or placebo through the IVRS/IWRS using a centrally administered stratified 
permuted block randomization by type of background therapy (Strata 1: PDE5-I and sGC 
sti
mulator; Strata 2: ERA) which will be balanced across the two treatment groups.  Subjects will 
also be stratified by Baseline 6MWD (less than or equal to 350 meters and greater than 
350 meters).  Block sizes will be variable and not disclosed to Investigators so that no inferences 
c
an be made about possible treatment assignments of current or future subjects. 
Prior to randomization, site personnel should complete a Pre-Baseline Review Form for review 
and approval by the Medical Monitor. 
5.3 BLINDING 
The Investigator, study site, subject, and sponsor will not be aware of the treatment allocation.  
All clinical trial material (CTM) will be provided as blinded study drug.  See Section 6.2 for the 
procedure for unblinding subjects at the end of study to determine appropriate starting dose for 
the open-label study (TDE- PH-311). 
6 DR UGS AND DOSING 
6.1 DR UG DOSAGE, ADMINISTRATION AND SCHEDULE 
The UT-15C tablets are sustained release osmotic tablets.  Active treatment is UT-15C tablets 
provided as 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2.5 mg strengths. The 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2.5 mg tablets 
a
re colored blue, green, white, yellow, and pink, respectively.  The formulation contains 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 49  pharmaceutically acceptable excipients used in other approved drug products.  Placebo tablets 
a
re identical in size, shape, and color to the respective UT- 15C tablets. 
Once all entry criteria have been met and random treatment assignment confirmed, the first dose 
of study drug (0.125 mg) should be taken at the site by the subjec t immediately after 
(~10 minutes) consuming food. Oral dosing of study drug will be continued at 0.125 mg TID 
(e
very 6 to 8 hours) immediately after (~10 minutes) consuming food.  Subjects must be 
inst
ructed to take the appropriate amount of UT-15C tablets based upon their prescribed dose.  
Prior to the Week 4 visit, each dose of study drug should be adjusted in 0.125 mg increments 
e
very 24 hours as clinically indicated.  Following the Week 4 visit throughout the remainder of 
the study, each dose of study drug may be adjusted in 0.125 or 0.25 mg increments every 
24 hours as clinically indicated.  The maximum allowable dose of study drug will be 12 mg TID.   
Dose
s of study drug should continue to be increased in the absence of dose-limiting drug-related 
adverse effects, to ensure that each subject receives the optimal clinical dose throughout the 
stud
y.  Table 6-1 provides a range of doses that may be reasonable targets for a subject to 
a
chieve by visit notwithstanding any AEs that limit dose escalation.  
Table 6-1 Study Drug Goal Dose Titration Ranges 
Study Week  Dose (mg) Three Times Daily  
4 0.5 – 1.5 
8 1.5 – 2.5 
12 2.5 – 3.5 
24 5.5 – 6.5 
 
Dose changes should be conducted under appropriate medical supervision in consultation with 
the study site.  Each dose of study drug is not required to be the same during titration. For 
example, doses of 1.125 mg morning, 1.125 mg afternoon, and 1.25 mg evening, are acceptable 
during
 titration.  It is recommended that the difference between any of the three doses not exceed 
0.125 mg prior to Week 4 or 0.25 mg after Week 4. 
At least weekly telephone calls between site personnel and the subject should be made during the 
fir
st 24 weeks of the study to monitor AEs and make decisions about dose titration.  More 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 50  frequent telephone calls may be necessary depending on the frequency of dose titration and to 
mana
ge AEs or signs and symptoms of disease.  If dose titration is considered appropriate, site 
pe
rsonnel will instruct the subject to modify their dose.  Study drug dosing should be recorded at 
each study visit between Baseline and Week 24. Dose changes between Baseline and Week 24 
will
 be recorded in source documentation and the subject’s eCRF by site personnel.  Beyond 
W
eek 24, study drug dose will be recorded on the day of Continued Visits (e.g. Weeks 36, 48, 
e
tc.) and every 30 days between Continued Visits in source documentation and the eCRF by site 
pe
rsonnel.  If it becomes necessary for a subject to modify their dose (e.g., due to an AE) without 
prior instructions from site personnel, the subject should be instructed to contact the site as soon 
as possible and report any dose changes to site personnel for updating in source documentation 
and the e CRF  as appropriate. 
Af
ter Week 24, at least monthly telephone calls should be made to continue to monitor AEs and 
make decisions regarding appropriate dose titrations.  More frequent telephone calls may be 
necessary depending on the frequency of dose titration and to manage AEs or signs and 
symptoms of disease.  Site personnel should record all dose changes in source documentation 
fr
om Week 24 until Study Termination. 
In the event a subject requires to be permanentl y discontinued from study drug (e.g. as a result of 
clinical worsening or the subject wishes to withdraw from further participation in the study), the 
Investigator should conduct the study drug termination assessments and then gradually down 
titrate the st udy drug, taking into consideration the subject’s clinical condition, current study 
drug dosing regimen, and previous clinical response to study drug. 
Throughout the course of the study, the dose of study drug should continue to be increased at the 
discr
etion of the Investigator up to a maximum allowable dose of 12 mg TID.  Dose escalation 
may be made less frequently or temporarily suspended if a subject experiences an intolerable AE 
that may worsen as a result of an increase in study drug dose.  If an AE remains intolerable, the 
I
nvestigator may decrease the dose of study drug.  In the event of continued intolerable AEs, 
dose reductions may occur. The exact dose reduction and frequency of dose reduction should be 
based on the clinical condition of the subject and the severity/seriousness of the event.  In 
general, dose reductions may occur in 0.125 mg or 0.25 mg increments every 12 to 24 hours. 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 51  Larger dose reductions may be necessary in the event of an emergency situation. If the subject is 
still experiencing an intolerable AE then the Investigator may temporarily or permanently 
withdraw the subject from study drug.  Following temporary discontinuation of study drug, all 
attempts should be made to re-initiate study drug in affected subjects.  Subjects should be 
re-started on study drug at a reduced dose or at 0.125 mg TID depending on the clinical 
condition of the subject, the subject’s previous response to study drug, the dose at the time of 
discontinuation, and the duration of temporary discontinuation from study drug.  Following 
restart of study drug, all efforts should be made to increase the dose until the desired clinical 
improvement in the subject’s symptoms of PAH occurs.  
Notwithstanding these study drug dosing guidelines, the well-being of each subject is paramount 
and all Investigators must act in accordance with the best medical interests of the subjects at all 
times during their participation in the study. 
6.1.1 Dosing of Study Drug in Relation to Meals 
Subjects should take study drug approximately every 6 to 8 hours with approximately 240 mL 
(8 ounces) of water or other beverage (e.g. juice, milk, soda, etc.) immediately after 
(~ 10 minutes) consuming food. 
S
ubjects should be instructed to be careful not to break, chew, or disrupt the integrity of the 
tablet as this will result in inappropriate delivery of the active ingredient.  If the tablet is 
inadvertently damaged during administration, the subject should contact site personnel in order 
to be monitored for the onset of symptoms due to possible overdose.  Any tablet damaged during 
handling by the subject should not be consumed by the subject.  The subject should be instructed 
to not
ify the study personnel and return the damaged study drug at the next scheduled visit. 
6.1.2 Dosing and Administration of Adjunctive Medications 
Every subject must be  receiving one PAH-approved oral monotherapy (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil, 
bosentan, ambrisentan, macitentan, or riociguat) for at least 30  days prior to randomization and 
on the same dose for at least 10 days prior to randomization.  Dosing of background 
PAH-approved oral monotherapy must comply with the prescribing information for the product. 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 52  All attempts should be made to adjust the dose of study drug rather than the dose of 
PAH-approved oral therapy to obtain the desired clinical response.  Throughout the course of the 
stud
y, dose and frequency of the PAH-approved oral therapy may not be increased to 
compensate for lack of efficacy.  Similarly, the dose and frequency of PAH-approved oral 
ther
apy should not be reduced during the study unless it is considered medically necessary to 
prote
ct the safety of the subject.  If the dose of PAH-approved oral therapy is inadvertently 
titrated during the course of the study, the dose should be titrated back to the dose used at the 
time of randomization, if medically appropriate.  If the dose of PAH-approved oral therapy is 
increased during the Treatment Phase and is not subsequently titrated back to the dose used at the 
time of randomization, the subject will need to be removed from the study. 
In the event a subject must undergo a change in background therapy, they should be switched to 
another agent in the same PAH-approved medication class if possible.  If another agent in the 
same class is not available, the subject should be switched to an agent from another class of 
PAH-approved medication.  If no alternative therapy is  available, the subject will continue in the 
stud
y until either a clinical worsening event has occurred, the subject withdraws from the study, 
or the study is completed/discontinued.  
All subjects must have been stabilized on optimal doses of conventional PAH therapies (e.g., 
oral vasodilators, digoxin, diuretics, oxygen, anticoagulants) for at least 10 days prior to 
randomization.  The exceptions are the discontinuation or dose changes of anticoagulants and/or 
dose
 change of diuretics.   After randomization, additions, deletions, and dose changes may occur 
if the
 Investigator determines it is medically necessary. 
6.2 AC CESS TO BLINDED TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT 
During the study, neither the site personnel, subject, nor sponsor should be unblinded to the 
treatment assignment of any subject for any reason except in the event of a medical emergency 
(e.g., a life threatening event), if and when knowledge of the treatment assignment is considered 
ne
cessary to determine the optimal medical management.  Appropriate communications should 
take place between the site and the sponsor before accessing the IVRS/IWRS to allow unblinding 
of a
 subject’s treatment assignment.  In the event of a medical emergency that requires immediate 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 53  unblinding, the IVRS/IWRS may be accessed by the Investigator to determine treatment 
assignment. 
Subjects who remain on study drug, complete required study assessments, and meet the 
definition of clinical worsening will be eligible for an open-label study (TDE- PH- 311).   Subjects 
re
quiring long term treatment (29 days or more) with infused or inhaled PGI 2 for treatment of 
wor
sening PAH are not eligible for the open-label study. Following completion of the Study 
Drug Termination assessments for a subject (see Table 3-1) and entry of required data into the 
I
VRS/IWRS, the site personnel will be unblinded to that subject’s treatment assignment.  If the 
subject received UT -15C during the study then the subject may remain on the same dose of study 
drug upon entry into the open-label study.  If the subject received placebo during the study then 
the subject should start treatment with UT-15C in the open-label study in accordance with that 
protoc
ol. 
S
ubjects who permanently discontinue study drug for any reason other than meeting the 
definition of clinical worsening are not eligible for entry into the open-label study.  The site 
pe
rsonnel will not be unblinded to the treatment assignment of these subjects unless required for 
safety reasons. 
Following completion of all Study Drug Termination assessments (see Table 3-1) a nd entry of 
required data into the IVRS/IWRS, the site personnel will be unblinded to that s ubject’s 
treatment assignment at the time of en rollment into  the open-label study.  After approximately 
205 adjudicated clinical worsening (morbidity or mortality) events have occurred, all ongoing 
subj
ects will be eligible for enrollment in the open-label study or gain access to drug 
commercially if approved. 
6.3 COM PLIANCE  
The Principal Investigator or other site personnel under the direction of the Principal Investigator 
will
 be responsible for dose titration of study drug and recording all dosing information in source 
documents.  During telephone calls, site personnel will record the current dose of study drug and 
de
termine if the subject is taking study drug as prescribed. 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 54  Each subject will be provided with a dosing diary in order to record dosing information from 
Randomization until Week 24; the use of the dosing diary is optional after Week 24.  At 
sc
heduled study visits, subjects should be instructed to bring all study drug (including empty and 
unused bottles) and their dosing diary to the investigational site.  Upon return of study drug and 
dosi
ng diary at the Week 4, 8, 12, and 24 visits, the study coordinator or pharmacist must 
document the number of returned tablets of each strength and determine if the appropriate 
amount of study drug remains based upon the dose of study drug prescribed. Each subject will 
also be asked at each visit whether he or she has been compliant with dosing instructions.  
Subject compliance with the prescribed dosage regimen will be monitored throughout the study.  
If it is determined that a subject is not compliant with study drug then site personnel must re-
educate the subject on proper dosing compliance and its importance.  Continued non-compliance 
may lead to withdrawal of the subject from the study, after consultation between the Investigator 
and the Sponsor.   
Upon r
eturn of study drug at all protocol-required on-site study visits (e.g. Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 
etc.), all bottles of study drug will be collected.  Study drug returned will not be re-dispensed to 
the subje
ct.  Site personnel will dispense a new supply of study drug at each protocol-required 
visit for the subsequent interval.  If necessary, additional study drug may be dispensed in 
be
tween protocol-required visits.   
7 E XPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

y drug. 
7.4 STUDY DRUG  TERMINATION VISIT 
S
ubjects will continue in the study until they experience clinical worsening, prematurely 
disconti
nue the study for any reason, or approximately 205 adjudicated clinical worsening events 
ha
ve occurred.  If a subject remains ongoing with study treatment at the time when 
approximately 205 adjudicated clinical worsening events have occurred, the Study Drug 
Termination Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible.  The following assessments will be 
conducted immediately after the decision is made to discontinue study drug (prior to down 
titration). 
 Vital si gns (following at least 5 minutes of rest) 
 Physical examination 
 Clinical worsening assessment 
 WHO Functional Class for PAH 

 AE assessment 
 Drug accountability/compliance 
 12-lead ECG (following at least 5 minutes rest in the semi-recumbent position) 

 Concomitant medications 
 6MWT /Borg dyspnea score (6MWT to be initiated 3 to 6 hours after last dose of study 
drug and following at least 5 minutes of rest; Borg dyspnea score to be conducted 
immediately following 6MWT) 
 Urine pregnancy test (for WOCBP) 
 C linical laboratory tests/ NT-proBNP

 C ollection of urine sample for evaluation of urine biomarkers (optional) 
 C ollection of blood sample for evaluation of pharmacogenomics (optional) 
If the subject permanently discontinues study drug prior to Week 24 for any reason other than 
clinical worsening (e.g.,  AEs, addition of second PAH-approved oral therapy), the subject should 
immediately complete the study drug termination visit assessments and be encouraged to remain 
in the study and complete all visits up to and including Week 24. The Study Drug Termination 
V
isit assessments should be conducted immediately after the decision is made to discontinue 
stud
y drug (prior to down titration). 
7.5 AC CESS TO THE OPEN-LABEL STUDY 
Subjects who discontinue the study due to clinical worsening as reviewed by the Medical 
Monitor and undergo Study Drug Termination assessments will be eligible for the open-label 
e
xtension study (TDE-PH-311) unless long-term (29  days or more) treatment with an infused or 
inhaled PGI 2 was initiated.  Subjects who prematurely discontinue the study for any reason other 
than c
linical worsening (e.g., AEs, withdrew consent, etc.) will not be eligible for entry into the 
ope
n-label study. 
Subjects who remain on study drug at the time that approximately 205 adjudicated clinical 
wor
sening events have occurred and complete Study Drug Termination assessments will be 
e
ligible for entry into the open-label extension study (TDE- PH- 311) or may gain access to 
commercial drug if approved. 
I
f a subject is eligible for the open-label extension study and received UT-15C during the blinded 
study then the subject may remain on the same dose of study drug upon entry into the open-label 
study.  If the subject received placebo during the blinded study then the subject should start 
treatment with UT-15C in the open-label study in accordance with that protocol. 
An 
IVRS/IWRS will be utilized to record appropriate efficacy data prior to providing each 
indi
vidual subject’s treatment assignment to appropriate site personnel in order to start each 
subject on the appropriate dose of UT-15C in the open-label study.

8 S TUDY TERMINATION 
8.1 CR ITERIA FOR SUBJECT WITHDRAW AL 
A subject may voluntarily withdraw or will be withdrawn from the study and/or study drug by 
the Investigator at any time for reasons including, but not limited to, the following: 
 The  subject wishes to withdraw from further participation 
 A se rious or life-threatening AE occurs or the Investigator considers that it is necessary to 
discontinue study drug to protect the safety of the subject 
 The  subject violated the protocol 
 The  subject’s behavior is likely to undermine the validity of his/her results 
 The  subject experiences clinical worsening 
 The  subject becomes pregnant 
If a subject is discontinued from the study prematurely, the Investigator will complete the End of 
Study Record for that subject and provide an explanation, if needed.  For subjects who meet the 
definition of clinical worsening, the site must complete the specified eCRF page (see 
Section 3.2.1.1).  If study drug has been administered, the Investigator should make every effort 
to per
form all Study Drug Termination Vis it assessments prior to study drug dose down-titration 
and study discontinuation. 
8.2 CRITERIA FOR TERMINATING THE STUDY 
The
 study may be stopped at any time if, in the opinion of the Investigator and/or sponsor, 
continuation of the study represents a serious medical risk to the subjects.  This may include, but 
is not limited to, the presence of serious, life-threatening, or fatal AEs or AEs that are 
unacceptable in nature, severity, or frequency.  The sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the 
study for any reason at any time. 
The end of the study (study completion) will be declared and subjects will be transitioned out of 
the study based on the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and Sponsor’s decision following the 
interim analysis, or approximately 205 adjudicated clinical worsening events have occurred, or 
the sponsor
 stops the study for any other reason. 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 61  8.3 CR ITERIA FOR DISCONTINUING THE SITE 
The study may also be terminated at a given center if: 
 The  Principal Investigator elects to discontinue the study 
 The  sponsor elects to discontinue the study at the site 
 Applicable regulations are not observed 
 The protocol is repeatedly violated or critical violations are documented 
 C hanges in personnel or facilities adversely affect performance of the study 
9 AD VERSE EVENT REPORTING  
9.1 DEF INITIONS 
9.1.1 Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical experience occurring to a subject during a clinical trial whether 
or not it is related to the study drug.  An AE may include an intercurrent illness, injury, or any 
other concomitan t impairment of the subject’s health, as well as abnormal laboratory findings if 
deemed to have clinical significance.  AEs may also include worsening of an existing symptom 
or condition or pre/post-treatment events that occur as a result of protocol-mandated procedures. 
9.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is an AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: 
 De ath 
 A life -threatening AE 
 I npatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
 A pe rsistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 A c ongenital anomaly/birth defect 
In addition, important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 62  Life-threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred.  It does not mean that the event, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death. 
Planned hospitalization for elective treatment or procedure for a pre-existing condition that did 
not worsen from the time of randomization (e.g. routine RHC) is not considered an SAE and 
doe
s not meet the definition for clinical worsening. 
9.1.3 Adverse Events Associated with Progression of PAH 
Expected events that are related to the progression of a subject’s PAH are defined in 
Appendix 15.6. All events that occur during the course of the study that are included on this list 
a
nd felt to be related to the progression of the disease by the Investigator should not be recorded 
as AEs in the eCRF as these PAH symptoms will be evaluated and recorded as an efficacy 
endpoint and/or will be captured as disease related events. 
However, an event must be recorded as an AE/SAE in the eCRF, if it mee ts one or more of the 
following criteria:  
 There is a reasonable possibility that it may have been caused by study drug. 
 It is serious. 
 It has occurred at greater than expected severity (intensity, frequency, or duration). 
9.2 DOCU MENTATION OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
AEs will be captured from the time the ICF is signed. An AE or SAE occurring during the study, 
following completion of the ICF, must be documented in the subject’s source documents and on 
the appropriate eCRF page.  Information relating to the AE such as onset and cessation date and 
times, intensity, seriousness, relationship to study drug, and outcome is also to be documented in 
the eCRF (see Section 15.4 for definitions).  Where possible, AEs should be recorded using 
standa
rd medical terminology.  If several signs or symptoms are clearly related to a medically 
defined diagnosis or syndrome, the diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the eCRF page, 
not the individual signs and symptoms. 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 63  All AEs should be followed until either resolution (or return to normal or pre-randomization 
values), until they are judged by the Investigator to no longer be clinically significant, or for up 
to 30 days if the AE extends beyond the final visit.  All SAEs that occur during the study will be 
followe
d until resolution, death, or the subject is lost to follow-up even if they are ongoing more 
than 30 days after completion of the final visit.  Supplemental measurements and/or evaluations 
may be necessary to investigate fully the nature and/or causality of an AE or SAE.  This may 
include additional laboratory tests, diagnostic procedures, or consultation with other healthcare 
professionals.  The eCRF pages should be updated with any new or additional information as 
appropriate. 
9.2.1 Clinical Worsening Events 
Clinical worsening events for this study include all clinical worsening (morbidity or mortality) 
events that meet the definition for clinical worsening (Section 3.2.1.1).  When these events 
oc
cur, they must be docu mented in the subject’s source documents and on the specified page of 
the eCRF and should be electronically submitted using the electronic eCRF platform within 
48 hours after the event becomes known to the Investigator or designee.  The Medical Monitor 
will
 review the event and correspond with the Investigator and site, as appropriate.  Although 
subjects may be discontinued from the study for medical necessity at any time, subjects should 
not be discontinued for a clinical worsening event until the event has been reviewed by the 
Medical Monitor.  Any clinical worsening event that is also an SAE(s) will be reported per the 
guidelines as specified in Sections 9.2 and 9.3. 
9.3 REP ORTING RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE INVESTIGATOR 
All SAEs, regardless of expectedness or causality, must be reported to the sponsor within 
24 hours of awareness by fax  
 or e-mail .  A c ompleted SAE report form along with 
a
ny relevant hospital records and autopsy reports should be provided to Global Drug Safe ty at 
United Therapeutics Corporation.  A follow-up SAE report form must be forwarded to Global 
Drug Safety at United Therapeutics Corporation within 48 hours of the receipt of any 
new/updated information.  The Investigator must also promptly notify their Investigational 
Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC) of the SAE, including any follow-up 

United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 64  information, in accordance with applicable national regulations and guidelines set forth by the 
IRB or EC. 
9.4 P REGNANCY 
If a study subject becomes pregnant during participation in this clinical study, site staff must 
notify the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy by completing the Pregnancy 
Notification Form and either faxing or e-mailing this form to Global Drug Safety at United 
Thera
peutics Corporation  
.  Subj
ects who become pregnant during the trial will be withdrawn 
from active participation in the trial and will discontinue study drug after an appropriate period 
of down-titration.   
United Therapeutics Global Drug Safety will follow up with the Investigator to ensure 
appropriate data are provided regarding the outcome of the pregnancy, and to request the 
Investigator to complete a Pregnancy Outcome Report Form.  Pregnancy only becomes an 
AE/SAE if there is an abnormal outcome, a spontaneous abortion, a termination for medical 
reasons other than PAH, or a congenital anomaly in the offspring. 
9.5 S AFETY REPORTS 
In accordance with national regulations, the sponsor or designee, will notify the regulatory 
agencies, Investigators, and/or IRBs and ECs of all relevant AEs (usually those that are 
c
onsidered to be possibly attributable to study drug and are both serious and unexpected) in 
ac
cordance with the applicable national regulations.  The Investigator must report these SAEs to 
their
 IRB or EC in accordance with applicable national regulations and guidelines set forth by 
the IRB or EC. 
10 S TATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
10.1 DATA PROCESSING 
Subject data will first be documented in the subject’s source documents, and then transferred into 
the eCRF .  Site personnel will be responsible for recording all subject data into the eCRF.  Data 
for any subject who signs an ICF will be captured in the eCRF.  The eCRF screens are to be 
reviewed by the Principal Investigator for completeness and accuracy.  The Principal 

United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 65  Investi gator must sign each subject’s eCRF to signify their approval of the data.  The database 
will be final when final query resolution has been completed and all data management quality 
control procedures are complete. 
10.2 S AMPLE SIZE 
Approximately 205 adjudicated events will provide at least 90% power with a Type I error rate 
of 0.0
5 (two-sided hypothesis) to detect a difference in the time to clinical worsening between 
tre
atment groups, assuming exponential distributions and an underlying hazard ratio of 0.62.  
Assuming a placebo median event time of 32 months (which corresponds to an event rate of 23% 
at Month 12), this hazard ratio corresponds to a median time to event of 51 months for the 
UT-15C group, or an event rate of 15% at Month 12.  If accrual of subjects is completed during 
the first three years and 10% of the subjects drop out by the end of the study, a total sample size 
of at least 610 subjects with a maximum of 850 subjects is expected to generate approximately 
205 adjudicated events over the course of the study. 
B
ased on the results of other PAH studies, (e.g., AMBITION [ambrisentan and tadalafil] and 
GRIPHON [selexipag]; Galiè, 2015; Sitbon, 2015) an interim analysis for efficacy is planned 
when 75% of the total adjudicated worsening events have occurred.  In order to control the total 
a
lpha at a two-sided 0.05 level, the method of Lan and DeMets with O’ B rien-Fleming-type alpha 
spending function will be used to calculate the boundaries for stopping the study for efficacy at 
the 
interim analysis [Lan and DeMets, 1983].  If the interim analysis is performed with 
154 events, the boundary on the p-value scale will be 0.020 and 0.044 for the final analysis.  
C
alculations will be performed in EAST version 6.4, Cytel Inc, using simulated power. 
I
f enrollment continues beyond the interim efficacy analysis, final enrollment will be stopped 
when approximately 190 clinical worsening (morbidity or mortality) events have been reported 
b
y Investigators and reviewed by the Medical Monitor.  Subjects will be followed until the 
occurrence of approximately 205 adjudicated clinical worsening events, at which time all 
remaining subjects will be transitioned to the open-label extension study.  No more than 
850 subjects will be enrolled.

Details of various efficacy and safety analyses are provided below.  Further details will be 
documented in a statistical analysis plan prior to any unblinding of study data by the sponsor.  
All statistical calculations will be done using the latest version of SAS (currently version 9.2). 
The
 Intent- to-Treat (ITT) population will be defined as all subjects randomized into the study 
that receive at least one dose of study drug; all subjects will be counted as being in the group to 
which they were randomized, regardless of the treatment they were actually given.  All efficacy 
analyses will be performed on this ITT population.  Additional efficacy analyses may be 
performed on further populations to be defined in a detailed statistical analysis plan. 
10.3.1  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary hypothesi s is that PAH-approved oral monotherapy in combination with UT - 15C 
will prolong the time to clinical worsening when compared with PAH-approved oral 
monot
herapy in combination with placebo in subjects with PAH.  The primary efficacy endpoint 
will be tested at an interim analysis when 75% of total adjudicated events have occurred with an 
a
lpha spending of 0.020 and at the final analysis at an alpha of 0.044 with the overall Type I 
error rate at 0.05.  Efficacy boundaries for early stopping of the trial for efficacy is calculated 
ba
sed on O’Brien -Fleming alpha-spending function. 
10.3.2  Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s) 
The effect of treatment will be formally tested on the following secondary endpoints: 
1. Ex ercise capacity as assessed by 6MWD measured at Week 24 
2. NT- proBNP at Week 24 
3. Combined 6MWD/Borg dyspnea score at Week 24 
In order to control the Type 1 error rate, the secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested using a 
hierarchical (fixed-sequence) testing procedure.  The 6MWD at Week 24 will be tested at a 
two-sided Type I error rate of 0.05.  The subsequent tests for NT-proBNP at Week 24 and then 
the c
ombined 6MWD/Borg dyspnea score at Week 24 will be tested only if the preceding test is 
statistically significant.  All other secondary endpoints will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics or analyzed using an exploratory approach.

 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 67  10.3.2.1  Borg Dy spnea Score 
The Borg dyspnea score is a 10-point scale rating the maximum level of dyspnea experienced 
during the 6MWT.  Scores range from 0 (for the best condition) to 10 (for the worst condition). 
The difference between treatment groups for the change from Baseline to each follow-up 
assessment will be tested using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. 
10.3.2.2  Combined 6MWD and Borg Dyspnea Score 
The intent of the 6MWT is to evaluate exercise capacity associated with carrying out activities of 
daily living.  However, the capacity of subjects to function is determined not only by what they 
c
an do when they exert themselves to the fullest, but also by how they feel when they are 
carrying out their usual activities of daily living.  It is therefore important not only to look at the 
distance traversed during the unencouraged 6MWT but also the symptoms experienced at the 
end of the effort.  To do so, walk distances and Borg dyspnea scores from each follow-up 6MWT 
will
 be simultaneously compared between treatment groups using non-parametric analysis of 
covariance within the framework of the extended Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (analogous to 
the analysis methodology for 6MWD). This methodology will be carried out as follows: 
1. S tandardized mid-ranks of walk distance will be calculated as described for the analysis 
of 6MWD; 
2. S tandardized mid-ranks of Borg dyspnea score will be calculated in an analogous 
manner; 
3. The  standardized mid-ranks for walk distance and for Borg dyspnea score will be 
combined by calculating their arithmetic average; 
4. A Coc hran-Mantel-Haenszel mean score test will be used on the standardized mid-ranks 
of these combined ranks. 
10.3.2.3  WHO Functional Class for Pulmonary Hypertension 
Changes from Baseline to each follow up assessment in WHO Functional Class will be 
summarized and compared between treatment groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. 
10.3.2.4  N-terminal pro-BNP 
Changes from Baseline to each follow up assessment in plasma NT-proBNP will be summarized 
and compared between treatment groups.

Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 68  10.3.2.5  Hemodynamics (optional) 
Changes fro m Baseline to Week 24 in hemodynamic parameters as assessed by RHC will be 
summarized and compared between treatment groups. 
10.3.3  Exploratory Endpoints 
The following parameters will be evaluated: 
 Optional e valuation of biomarkers 
 Optional e valuation of pharmacogenomics 
10.3.4  Safety Analyses 
The safety population will be defined as all subjects in the study that receive study drug, and all 
subjects will be counted as being in the group corresponding to the treatment that they actually 
received.  If a subject received UT-15C at any point during the study, they will be counted in the 
UT-15C treatment group within the safety population.  All safety analyses will be performed on 
the sa
fety population. 
The safety of UT-15C will be evaluated by comparisons of AEs, clinical laboratory parameters, 
and vital signs in the two treatment groups.  All AEs as recorded by the Investigators will be 
assigned MedDRA preferred terms by the sponsor for reporting purposes.  For all safety 
endpoints, tabular summaries will be provided. 
10.4 INTERIM ANALYSIS 
Interim safety analyses are intended to be performed after approximately 200, 400, and 
600 subjects are enrolled in the study, or ad hoc per request of the independent DMC, as 
ne
cessary (see Section 10.7). 
In addition, the independent DMC will review the results of a single efficacy interim analysis 
after 75% of total adjudicated clinical worsening events have occurred (which corresponds to 
154 events).  
All interim analyses for safety and efficacy will be performed by a statistical group independent 
of the study conduct.  All unblinded results will only be reviewed by the independent DMC 
members.

Exploratory analyses may be conducted based on available study data. 
10.6 DATA LISTINGS AND SUMMARIES 
All data gathered in this study will be presented in summary tables and listings in the clinical 
study report. 
10.7 DA TA MONITORING COMMITTEE 
A DMC will be established for the study, composed of up to five independent members 
including physicians knowledgeable in the treatment of PAH and a statistician.  Throughout the 
course of the study, the DMC will meet on a regular basis to monitor the safety of the study.  
Me
etings will occur after approximately 200, 400, an d 600 subjects are enrolled in the study or 
a
d hoc per request of the DMC, as necessary.  In addition, the DMC will review the interim 
analysis results for efficacy data when 75% (corresponding to 154 events) of the total 
approximately 205 adjudicated clinical worsening (morbidity and mortality) events have 
accrued.  The DMC will be blinded to individual subject treatment allocation during the review 
proce ss.  All analyses will be prepared by an independent external consultant and reviewed only 
by the DMC as defined in the DMC charter.  The DMC will also review the formal interim 
analysis results and recommend continuation or early termination of the study based on stopping 
criteria defined in the DMC charter.  The sponsor will only have access to blinded study data 
unti
l the database lock for the primary analysis.  
10.8 CLINICA L WORSENING ADJUDICATION COMMITTEE 
An adjudication committee, comprised of at least three members, including physicians 
knowledgeable in the treatment of PAH,  has been established for the study.  Members of the 
adjudication committee are independent of the DMC and cannot participate as Investigato rs in 
thi
s study.  The adjudication committee will be blinded to individual subject treatment allocation 
during
 the review process.  If the adjudication committee does  not agree with an Investigator’ s  
assessment of clinical worsening for a given subject, this subject will not be included in the 
a
nalysis and their worsening event will not count towards the total number of adjudicated events 
needed to complete the study.

study personnel at every protocol-required visit. 
11.4 S UPPLY AND RETURN OF CTM 
Study sites will be supplied with a sufficient quantity of study drug to begin enrollment in the 
study.  At Randomization, an IVRS/IWRS will be utilized by site personnel to randomize each 
subj
ect and assign the appropriate study drug bottles for the first 4-week treatment interval.  At 
subseque
nt visits to the clinic the IVRS/IWRS will be utilized by site personnel to assign new 
study drug bottles to each subject based upon their current dose of study drug and the length of 
ti
me until the next protocol-required visit.  Additional study drug supply may occur between 
protoc
ol-required visits as required.  At each protocol-required study visit all unused study drug 
dispensed to the subject should be returned to the study site (including empty and unopened 
bottles). 
11.5 DR UG ACCOUNTABILITY 
The Investigator is responsible for study drug accountability and reconciliation overall and on a 
per subject basis.  Drug accountability records will be maintained during the study and these 
records will include:  the amount of study drug received from the sponsor, the amount dispensed 
to ea
ch subject, and the amount of unused drug.  At each visit, site personnel should assess drug 
dispensed, drug returned, and dosing information to confirm drug accountability and compliance. 
Once a representative from the sponsor is able to confirm drug accountability for that subject, 
study drug will be returned to a sponsor designated location for destruction. Study drug will not 
be
 destroyed on-site by the study staff or in the pharmacy.

15.1 P ROCEDURE FOR 6-MINUTE WALK EXERCISE TEST AND BORG 
DY
SPNEA SCALE 
General Procedures 
The 6 minute walk exercise test should be administered by the same tester and on the same 
course at each study site throughout the study for a given subject.  The administration of the test 
a
nd specifications of the testing area should be generally consistent with the American Thoracic 
Society guidelines and the usual practice of the investigative site [ATS guidelines; 2002]. 
The area used for the 6 minute walk test should be pre-measured at approximately 30 m in length 
(but no shorter than 15 m [16 yards or 50 feet] in length at minimum) and at least 2 to 3 m in 
width.  The
re should be no turns or curves to the 6 minute walk area.  The length should be 
mar
ked with gradations at least every 3 meters to ensure the accurate measurement of the 
distance walked.  The area should be well ventilated.  The tester may be at the starting end of the 
corridor or at the midpoint of the corridor with a stop-watch.  Intermittent rest periods are 
allowed if the subject can no longer continue.  If the subject needs to rest briefly, he/she may 
stand or sit and then begin again when he/she is sufficiently rested but the clock will continue to 
run.  At the end of 6 minutes, the tester will call “stop” while simultaneously stopping the watch 
a
nd then measure the distance walked.  The Borg dyspnea rating will be administer ed 
immediately following completion of the 6MWT. 
Instructions to the Subject  
Subjects will be instructed that the preceding meal should be light.  Subjects should be told to 
wear comfortable clothing and sneakers or comfortable walking shoes.  The person 
administering the test will use the following exact dialogue with the subject: 
“The purpose of this test is to find out how far you can walk in six minutes.  You will start from 
this point and follow the hallway to the marker (e.g. chair) at the end, turn around and walk back.  
When you arrive back at the starting point you will go back and forth again.  You will go back 
and forth as many times as you can in the 6-minute period.  You may stop and rest if you need 
to.  Just remain where you are until you can go on again.  However, the most important thing 
about the test is that you cover as much ground as you possibly can during the 6 minutes.  I will 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 78  tell you the time, and I will let you know when the 6 minutes are up.  When I say STOP, please 
stand right wh ere you are.” 
After these instructions are given to the subject, the person administering the test will then ask: 
“Do you have any questions about the test?”  
“Please explain to me what you are going to do.”  
The person administering the test will then start the test by saying the following to the subject: 
“Are you ready?”  
“Start when I say “GO.”  
The person administering the test will tell the subject the time at 2 and 4 minutes by saying: 
“You have completed 2 minutes.”  
And then by saying: 
“You have completed 4 minutes.”  
No other instruction or encouragement will be given during the test.  Eye contact with the subject 
should be avoided during the test. 
Following the walk, the person administering the test will obtain a rating of dyspnea using the 
Borg Scale.  The person will use the following dialogue: 
“
I would like to use the following scale to indicate the maximal shortness of breath you had 
during the walk test (indicate the Borg Scale).  If there was no shortness of breath at all you 
would point to 0; if the shortness of breath was not very great you would choose from 0.5 to 
2; if you were somewhat more short of breath you would select 3; and if the breathing was 
getting very difficult, you would choose 4 to 9, depending on just how hard it was; 10 
represents the greatest shortness of breath you have ever experienced in your life, and if you 
feel more short of breath than you have ever been in your life before, choose a number 
greater than 10 that represents how short of breath you feel.  If one of the numbers does not 
exactly represent how short of breath you are, then you can choose a fraction between.  For 
example, if you had shortness of breath somewhere between 4 and 5, you could choose 4 ½.

The Principal Investigator or a designated member of his/her staff will probe each subject for any 
AEs that may have occurred.  The Investigator should always ask the same question when 
conducting the verbal probe in order to ensure uniformity between subjects.  The Investigator 
should ask: 
 “How are you doing (feeling)?”  
Based on the subject’s response to this question, the Investigator should ask additional questions 
relevant to the specific complaint such as: 
 “How severe is/was the symptom?”  
 “How often did the symptom occur?”  
 “How long did the symptom last?”  
Using provided definitions, the Investigator will then: 
(1) rate the intensity and seriousness of the AE, (2) estimate the causality of the AE to study 
drug, and (3) note actions taken to counteract the AE. 
Definitions of Intensity, Seriousness, Causality, Action Taken, and Outcome 
INTENSITY 
An assessment of the relative intensity (severity) of an AE is based on the I nvestigator’s clinical 
judgment.  The maximum intensity encountered during the evaluation period should be checked.  
The assessment of intensity should be independent of the assessment of the seriousness of the 
AE.  
SERIOUSNESS 
A serious AE is one that represents an actual or potential significant hazard.  This includes, but is 
not limited to, an event that is fatal, life-threatening, permanently or severely disabling, requires 
or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, is a congenital abnormality (offspring of subject) or is 
medically significant (important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, 
or require hospitalization may be considered a serious AE when, based upon appropriate medical 
United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8 
 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 82  judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition). 
CAUSALITY 
An estimate of causality between a specified AE and the study drug is made by the Investigator.  
Definitions of the categories follow: 
 NO T RELATED - there is not a temporal relationship to study drug administration (too 
early, or late, or study drug not taken), or there is a reasonable causal relationship 
be
tween another drug, or concurrent disease and the SAE 
 P OSSIBLE - there is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the 
SAE.  Dechallenge information is lacking or unclear 
 PROBABLE - there is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the 
SAE.  The event responds to dechallenge.  Rechallenge is not required 
ACTION TAKEN 
TEST AGENT DOSE MODIFICATION* 
 Dose  Increased - the dose or regimen of the test agent was increased 
 Dose Not Changed - the dose or regimen of the test agent was not changed 
 Dose  Reduced - the dose or regimen of the test agent was decreased 
 Dr ug Interrupted - administration of the test agent was stopped temporarily 
 Drug Withdrawn - administration of the test agent was stopped permanently and not 
restarted 
 Unknown - changes to the administration of the test agent cannot be determined 
*NO
TE:  Only the last test agent action should be recorded in the eCRF. 
OUTCOME 
 Fatal - The study subject died  
 Not Recovered/Not Resolved - The AE was ongoing 
 R ecovered/Resolved - The AE resolved 
 R ecovered/Resolved with Sequelae - The AE is considered resolved however there is a 
residual sequelae 
 R ecovering/Resolving - The AE is improving but is not yet completely 
recovered/resolved 
 Unknown - The outcome of the AE cannot be determined

United Therapeutics Corporation TDE -PH-310 Amendment 8

Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 86  A Sub-study to Collect the Vital Status of Subjects Who Discontinue 
from the Study or Open-Label Extension Study (TDE- PH-311)  
1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
Eve
n though subjects may discontinue from the study or open-label extension study 
(TDE- PH-311) for a variety of reasons, it is important to continue collecting vital status data on 
such subjects until the study is completed.  Collection of the vital status data will allow an 
int
ention- to-treat overall survival analysis to be conducted using actual rather than imputed vital 
status data. This will be a separate analysis from the primary and secondary efficacy analysis and 
will provide supportive data for regulatory filings of oral treprostinil. 
If and when a subject discontinues from the study or open-label extension study (TDE- PH-311), 
attempts should be made to obtain their consent to record their vital status up to the date of final 
completion of the study (i.e., when all patient have exited the study).  Attempts should be made 
to collec
t survival data on all subjects, even those who are apparently lost to follow-up.  
2 OBJECTIVE 
To c
ollect vital status data for subjects who discontinue from the study or open-label extension 
stud
y (TDE- PH-311) to support an overall survival analysis of study participants 
3 EXPERIMENTAL PLAN 
Vital st
atus for subjects who discontinue from the study or open-label extension study 
(TDE- PH-311) will be assessed every 6-months from their date of discontinuation via telephone 
calls and/or other methods as described below for the duration of the study. The data will 
continue to be collected in this study until the last subject has exited from the study.  
Subjects are considered to have discontinued from the study if and when they discontinue and do 
not enroll into the open-label extension study (TDE- PH-311). Subjects are considered to have 
prematurely discontinued from the open-label extension study (TDE- PH-311) if they discontinue 
before the completion of the study (i.e.,  before the last subject has exited the study).

 Oral Treprostinil 
Version date: 09 August 2017 Confidential Page 87  4 ESTIMATED STUDY DURATION 
Vital st
atus data will be collected every 6 months beginning from the date that each subject 
discontinues either the study or open-label extension study (TDE- PH-311) until the last subject 
exits the study. 
5 DATA COLLECTION AND FOLLOW-UP OF SUBJECTS 
S
urvival status for discontinued subjects will be collected every 6 months from the date of 
discontinuation via telephone calls or other methods as described below. The collection of vital 
status should include whether or not the subject is alive.  
 I f dead, the date of death must be obtained.  
 I f alive, the last known date the subject was confirmed to be alive must be provided.  
 F or those subjects who are lost to follow-up, the last known date that the subject was 
confirmed to be alive will be their date of the last contact with the site.  
Methods to confirm subjects’ survival status other than the reco mmended telephone calls every 
6 months, may include and are not limited to, in-person study visits, searching of hospital 
re
cords, and searching local and/or national public registries following applicable laws and 
regulations.  
Any AEs that are spontaneously reported by the subject that occur on the commercially-available 
United Therapeutics drug should not be submitted as part of the study, rather, they will be 
subject to AE/SAE reporting under local government post-marketing AE/SAE reporting 
requirements.  
6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Vital status data collected from subjects who discontinue from the study or open-label extension 
study (TDE- PH-311) will be combined with the data collected during the study and the 
open -label extension study (TDE- PH-311) for sensitivity analysis of overall survival.  Vital 
status data collection from subjects who have discontinued the study minimizes the missing data 
for these analysis.

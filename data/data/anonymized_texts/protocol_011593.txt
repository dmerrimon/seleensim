This amendment incorporates all revisions to date, including amendments made at the 
request of country health authorities and IRBs/ECs and any protocol administrative change letter(s). 
Protocol Amendment Summary of Changes TableAmendment 2 (16 September 2022)Overall Rationale for the Amendment: The protocol was amended to add Cohort 3 to 
randomize approximately 112 participants across 4 additional study arms, including placebo 
and 3 PF-06882961 arms with 4-week dose titration steps to target doses of 80 mg BID, 
140 mg BID and 200 mg BID. This cohort was added to characterize the tolerability and efficacy profile of 4-week dose titration steps. A separate visit schedule for Cohort 3 was added to the protocol to correspond to the 4-week dose titration intervals and extension of the treatment phase to 32 weeks for this cohort, to allow sufficient treatment duration at steady state dosing given the longer titration steps, and to generate additional efficacy data over a longer treatment period.

Removed wording referring to approaches for study conduct and data analyses if Part B was not approved. The original protocol included a 2-part double-blind treatment phase with Part B dosing Weeks 17-26 contingent on supportive data from a nonclinical toxicology study ongoing at the time of original protocol finalization. Part B was approved and all participants in Cohorts 1 and 2 were able to continue into Part B, so removed wording for alternative approaches if Part B was not conducted.Nonsubstantial
Throughout protocolReplaced “standard” with “1-week” and “slow” with “2-week” when referring to titration schemes for study arms in Cohorts 1 and 2.Revised terminology for description of titration schemes for Cohorts 1 and 2 to denote number of weeks rather than “standard” and “slow” (ie, 1-week and 2-week, respectively) for consistency in how titration is described across all 3 cohorts in the study.Nonsubstantial

Overall Design
This is a Phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 
study to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability and PK of twice daily oral administration of PF-06882961 in adult participants with obesity.  There are 3 Cohorts included in the study: Cohort 1 under the original protocol, Cohort 2 added under Amendment 1, and Cohort 3 added under Amendment 2.))

Page 17Eligible participants who maintain acceptable compliance during a 2-week placebo run-in 
period are randomized on Day 1 to double-blinded study intervention. For Cohort 1, participants were randomized into 1 of 9 study arms (placebo: 5 PF-06882961 arms with 1-week titration steps: 3 PF-06882961 arms with 2-week titration steps).  Additional participants were enrolled into the placebo and 3 2-week titration arms as part of Cohort 2, which was added to better characterize the tolerability and efficacy profile of the 2-week titration schemes, relative to the 1-week titration schemes, with placebo included to maintain the double-blind study design.  For Cohort 2, all SoA activities are the same as for the original cohort (Cohort 1) of randomized participants. In Cohort 3, participants will be randomized to 1 of 4 additional study arms (placebo: 3 PF-06882961 arms with 4-week titration steps) to characterize the tolerability and efficacy profile of 4-week dose titration steps, with placebo included to maintain the double-blind aspect.
Randomization is stratified according to biological gender (female versus male), as both
tolerability and efficacy may be different between men and women. This stratification is intended to balance the numbers of participants of either gender across treatment arms.  In addition, no more than approximately 70% of the trial population will consist of 1 gender, in order to permit adequate representation of both men and women in the trial population.  
Number of ParticipantsThere will be total of approximately 581 participants across all 3 cohorts of this study.Combining Cohorts 1 and 2, there were a total of approximately 469 participants randomized 
(approximately 67 in the placebo, approximately 60 in each of the 5 PF-06882961 arms with 1-week titration steps and approximately 34 in each of the 3 PF-06882961 arms with 2-week titration steps). In Cohort 3, approximately 112 participants will be randomized to 4 additional study arms (approximately 16 in the placebo and approximately 32 in each of 3 PF-06882961 arms with 4-week titration steps).  
Intervention Groups and DurationFor the purposes of this protocol, study intervention refers to PF-06882961 and matching 
placebo. Blinded study intervention will be provided as tablets for oral administration, with the placebo run-in being single blinded (participant only) and the randomized treatment period being double-blinded. Participants in Cohorts 1 and 2 are instructed to take 4 tablets 
of study intervention in the morning with food and 4 tablets of study intervention in the 
evening with food, for a total of 8 tablets daily. Participants in Cohort 3 are instructed to take 2 tablets of study intervention in the morning with food and 2 tablets of study intervention in the evening with food, for a total of 4 tablets daily. The morning and evening doses should be taken approximately 10-12 hours apart and at approximately the same time each day.
All dosing regimens for all cohorts include dose titration to enhance tolerability of 
PF-06882961, where the dose level is increased at set intervals of 1, 2 or 4 weeks until a target dose is achieved. For Cohort 1, participants were randomized into 9 arms in a 3:3:3:3:3:3:1:1:1 ratio (placebo: 5 PF-06882961 arms with 1-week titration steps:

Statistical MethodsDetailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study 
is further detailed in a SAP, which will be maintained by the sponsor.  Data from participants enrolled into the original cohort (Cohort 1) and Cohort 2 will be combined for reporting,where data from the placebo and 2-week titration arms will be combined from the 2 cohorts and analyzed together. Data from participants enrolled into Cohort 3 will be analyzed separately unless otherwise specified.
The primary estimand (Estimand 1) will be the population average treatment effect on the 
percent CFB in body weight at End of Treatment of PF-06882961 compared to placebo in all evaluable participants while on treatment. 
For Cohorts 1 and 2, End of Treatment is defined as Week 26. For Cohort 3, End of 
Treatment is defined as Week 32. Measurements after discontinuation of study intervention will be censored and treated as missing data.  Missing data due to censoring, study withdrawal or other reasons will have data imputed based on a MAR assumption.  The population-based treatment effect will be percent CFB in each PF-06882961 arm compared to placebo.
A secondary estimand will be the population odds ratio of the treatment effect of achieving a 
body weight loss ≥ 5% from baseline at End of Treatment of PF-06882961 compared to 
placebo in all evaluable participants while on treatment. All other key secondary continuous clinical endpoints will be analyzed using a similar estimand to the primary estimand described above.CCI

Page 20The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted using a MMRM analysis of 
the CFB in body weight through End of Treatment, and Cohorts 1 and 2 will be analyzed separately to Cohort 3. MMRM models will be fitted to the CFB of log
e-transformed values. 
The model for Cohorts 1 and 2 will include Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 18, 22 and 26. The model for Cohort 3 will include Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32.
The primary analysis will include all participants randomly assigned to study intervention 
and who take at least 1 dose of randomized study intervention.  The MMRM models will include treatment, time, strata (females versus males) and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects, baseline as a covariate and the baseline-by-time interaction with time fitted as a repeated effect and participant as a random effect.  Baseline body weight will be included on the log
escale.  An unstructured correlation matrix will be used, and the Kenward-Roger 
approximation will be used for estimating degrees of freedom for the model parameters.  Missing values will be imputed as part of the MMRM model assumptions and no adjustments will be made for multiplicity.  The modelled mean log
e-differences and 90% CIs for the 
log e-differences at End of Treatment will be extracted from the model and exponentiated to 
provide estimates of the relative difference in each PF-06882961 treatment arm reported separately, compared to placebo.

Page 302. INTRODUCTION
GLP-1 is a neuroendocrine hormone that is predominantly released from the small intestine 
in response to food intake.1  GLP-1 activation of the GLP-1R stimulates insulin release, 
inhibits glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, and delays gastric emptying.2,3  
In addition, GLP-1 has been shown to increase satiety and suppress food intake.4  
PF-06882961 is an orally administered, small molecule GLP-1R agonist that has been demonstrated, in nonclinical models, to stimulate glucose-dependent insulin release and suppress food intake with equivalent efficacy to an injectable peptide GLP-1R agonist approved for the treatment of T2DM.
PF-06882961 is an oral, small molecule GLP-1R agonist that is currently being investigated
for the treatment of T2DM, and also as an adjunct to diet and exercise for weight loss in adultparticipants with obesity.
2.1. Study Rationale 
This multicenter, Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 
dose-ranging study is being conducted in adults with obesity.  There are 3 Cohorts included in the study: Cohort 1 under the original protocol, Cohort 2 added under Amendment 1, and Cohort 3 added under Amendment 2, as described in Section 4 .
This study will assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability and PK of PF-06882961 in adults with obesity and is intended to enable selection of efficacious doses for future clinical development of PF-06882961 for weight loss in adults with obesity.
2.2. Background 
Obesity is a chronic disease that is associated with serious co-morbidities, including T2DM, 
dyslipidemia, hypertension, atherosclerosis, obstructive sleep apnea and certain cancers,
5and 
is also associated with increased all-cause mortality.6  The global burden of obesity is high 
with more than 600 million adults estimated to have obesity worldwide. In addition, the prevalence of obesity has doubled in more than 70 countries since 1980 and poses a major public health challenge.
7,8  First line treatment for obesity is lifestyle intervention including 
diet, exercise and behavioral therapy.  While effective in many patients, lifestyle intervention is often not sustainable, and many patients regain weight after initial weight loss.
9  
Pharmacotherapy has been approved for the long-term treatment of obesity and can be a useful adjunct to lifestyle intervention to augment and maintain weight loss.
Marketed injectable GLP-1R agonists have demonstrated robust glycemic efficacy, weight 
loss, and cardiovascular safety, with more than one marketed agent demonstrating cardiovascular benefit.
10  Based on the clinical history of injectable GLP-1R agonists, an 
oral, small molecule GLP-1R agonist is expected to decrease appetite and food intake, resulting in weight loss in patients with obesity, while avoiding the subcutaneous injection required by currently available peptidic GLP-1R agonists.

More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected AEs of PF-06882961 may be 
found in the IB, which is SRSD for this study.
2.3.1. Risk Assessment
Potential Risk of Clinical 
SignificanceSummary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy
Study Intervention(s) PF-06882961
Thyroid C-cell tumors The potential risks are based on product labeling for peptidic 
marketed GLP-1R agonists (ie, semaglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, 
and exenatide) due to dose-dependent and treatment duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors in nonclinical studies in rats and mice at clinically relevant exposures. 
Thyroid C-cell tumors have not been observed with PF-06882961 in 
clinical or nonclinical studies.Potential participants with a personal or family 
history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or Multiple 
Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 are excluded from the clinical development program. Thyroid function tests are included in the clinical trial protocols to monitor participants’ thyroid function.  
Pancreatitis The potential risks are based on product labeling for peptidic
GLP-1R agonists (ie, semaglutide, liraglutide, exenatide and dulaglutide). 
Pancreatitis has not been observed in the PF-06882961 clinical trial 
program.Per exclusion criteria, potential participants with 
acute pancreatitis or a history of pancreatitis are not 
eligible for study entry.  Serum amylase and lipase are monitored during the clinical studies.  
Hypoglycemia Clinical trials with peptidic GLP-1R agonists have not demonstrated 
an increased risk for hypoglycemia.  However, when administered in 
combination with anti-diabetic agents that are known to have an 
increased risk of hypoglycemia (such as insulin or sulfonylureas), an increased risk for hypoglycemia was observed. 
Participants with obesity who do not have co-existing T2DM would 
not be taking anti-diabetic agents and therefore would not be expected to have an increased risk for hypoglycemia.  
A low overall incidence of generally mild hypoglycemia has been 
reported in the PF -06882961 clinical dev elopment program to date.Anti-diabetic medications are prohibited in this study, and blood glucose is monitored via central 
lab assessments at every clinical visit in this study. 
Participants are informed about the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, and are monitoring for these symptoms at clinical study visits.

Page 36Potential Risk of Clinical 
SignificanceSummary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy
Increase in HR The potential risk is based on the product labeling for the injectable 
GLP 1R agonists liraglutide and semaglutide for T2DM and for obesity.  
Increases in HR have been noted in the clinical program with 
PF-06882961 with most values within the normal range. While there have been isolated vital sign values outside the reference ranges observed, in these cases the values were not considered clinically 
significant and there were no clinically significant adverse trends
observed across dose levels, to date. Vital signs, including HR and BP, and ECGs are assessed at all onsite study visits in all participants.
Acute gallbladder disease Substantial or rapid weight loss can increase the risk of cholelithiasis.
The potential risk is based on the product labeling for the injectable GLP 1R agonist liraglutide for obesity and also exenatide.  
In the completed clinical studies with PF-06882961, no 
treatment-emergent events of cholelithiasis have been observed.Participants with symptomatic gallbladder disease are excluded from this clinical study. Participants are monitored at clinical visits for AEs and laboratory tests that may suggest development of acute gallbladder disease.
Study Procedures
Use of a placebo arm Participants randomized to placebo may not experience weight loss 
efficacy. A majority of the randomized study population will 
receive PF-06882961, and all participants will 
receive lifestyle counseling, which is standard of 
care for management of obesity.

Page 372.3.2. Benefit Assessment
Based on the clinical history of injectable GLP-1R agonists, participants with obesity 
randomized to PF-06882961 may have diminished food intake and decreased body weight.  Other potential benefits for all participants in this study may include receiving lifestyle counseling, receiving medical evaluations/assessments associated with clinical study visits (eg, physical examinations, ECGs, labs), and contributing to the process of developing a potential new therapy for weight loss.
2.3.3. Overall Benefit/Risk Conclusion
Considering all available clinical and nonclinical data, the benefit-risk profile of 
PF-06882961 supports continued clinical development in participants with obesity.

4. STUDY DESIGN
4.1. Overall DesignThis Phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,  parallel group, 
study will assess efficacy, safety, tolerability and PK of twice daily oral administration of PF-06882961 in adult participants with obesity. There are 3 Cohorts included in the study: Cohort 1 under the original protocol, Cohort 2 added under Amendment 1, and Cohort 3 added under Amendment 2, as described below. 
For all cohorts, following the initial screening period to confirm eligibility (up to 4 weeks), 
screening continues with a 2-week placebo run-in period which will be single-blinded (participant).  Eligible participants who maintain acceptable compliance during the run-in period are randomized on Day 1 to double-blinded study intervention.  
This study was initially designed with a 2-part double-blinded treatment phase, as the 
16-week dosing duration of Part A was supported by the nonclinical toxicology data available at the time of the original protocol finalization, and dosing in Part B over Weeks 17-26 was contingent on availability of supportive nonclinical data from a 9-month toxicology study in monkeys (Study ) that was ongoing at that time, and is now completed.  For Cohort 1, participants were randomized into 9 arms: a placebo arm, 5 arms with 1-week titration steps (also referred to as standard titration in previous protocol versions), and 3 arms with 2-week titration steps (also referred to as slow titration in previous protocol versions). Protocol Amendment 1 added Cohort 2 where additional participants were randomized to the placebo and the 3 arms with 2-week titration steps. All SoA
activities are the same for Cohort 2 as for the original cohort (Cohort 1) of randomized participants. Part B was approved before any participant reached the end of Part A, and participants in both Cohorts 1 and 2 were able to proceed directly from Part A to Part B.  Accordingly, the primary endpoint for Cohorts 1 and 2 is based on End of Treatment defined as Week 26. For participants in Cohorts 1 and 2, the total duration of dosing with double-blinded study intervention is 26 weeks, followed by an approximate 4-week follow-up.  The total duration of participation in this study for the participants in Cohorts 1 and 2 is approximately 32 weeks, including the 2-week single-blind run-in period, butexcluding the initial screening period.
For Cohort 3, added under protocol Amendment 2, participants will be randomized to 
placebo or 1 of 3 PF-06882961 arms with 4-week dose titration steps.  The overall approach to study procedures is similar to the previous cohorts, however, the double-blinded treatment phase is not presented as 2-parts (as there is now supportive data for the full dosing duration as described above) and the visit schedule for Cohort 3 is adjusted to correspond to the 4-week dose titration intervals. The double-blinded treatment phase for Cohort 3 is extended to 32 weeks compared to 26 weeks for Cohorts 1 and 2 in order to allow for sufficient steady

Page 41state dosing given the longer titration intervals, and to generate additional efficacy data over 
a longer treatment period. Accordingly, the primary endpoint for Cohort 3 is based on End of Treatment defined as Week 32. For Cohort 3, the total duration of dosing with double-blinded study intervention is 32 weeks, followed by an approximate 4-week follow-up.  The total duration of study participation for participants in Cohort 3 is approximately 38 weeks, including the 2-week single-blind run-in period, but excluding the initial screening period.
All dosing regimens for all cohorts include dose titration to enhance tolerability of 
PF-06882961, where the dose level is increased at set intervals of 1, 2 or 4 weeks until a target dose is achieved (see Table 1 for Cohorts 1 and 2, and Table 2 for Cohort 3). For all 
cohorts, dosing is to occur with food twice daily. For the 5 1-week titration PF-06882961 groups in Cohort 1, the target dose levels for each of the arms are 40 mg BID, 80 mg BID, 120 mg BID, 160 mg BID, and 200 mg BID, with titration from a starting dose of 
mg BID, and up to weeks of the dosing duration used for titration. For the 3 2-week
titration PF-06882961 groups in Cohorts 1 and 2, target dose levels for each of the arms are 120 mg BID, 160 mg BID, and 200 mg BID, with titration from a starting dose of 
mg BID, and up to weeks used for titration. Both Cohorts 1 and 2 also include a 
placebo arm. For Cohort 3, participants will be enrolled into 4 study arms, and target dose levels are placebo and PF-06882961 doses of 80 mg BID, 140 mg BID, and 200 mg BID. For Cohort 3, titration will occur at 4-week intervals from a starting dose of  mg BID, and up to  weeks will be used for titration to reach the target dose. Additional details regarding dose titration are provided in Section 6.1 and in the IP Manual.
There will be total of approximately 581 participants across all 3 cohorts of this study. In Cohort 1, approximately 420 participants (approximately 60 in each of the placebo and 5 1-week titration PF-06882961 arms and approximately 20 in each of the 3 2-week titrationPF-06882961 arms) were randomized. All dosing arms, including placebo, were enrolled simultaneously in Cohort 1. Subsequently, in Cohort 2, approximately 49 additional participants were randomized to the placebo and 2-week titration arms (approximately 7 in the placebo and approximately 14 in each of the 3 2-week titration arms.).  Combining Cohorts 1 and 2, there were a total of approximately 469 participants randomized 
(approximately 67 in the placebo, approximately 60 in each of the 5 1-week titration arms 
and approximately 34 in each of the 3 2-week titration arms).  In Cohort 3, approximately 112 participants will be randomized to 4 additional study arms (approximately 16 in the placebo and approximately 32 in each of 3 PF-06882961 arms with 4-week titration steps).  
Randomization is stratified according to biological gender (female versus male), as both 
tolerability and efficacy may be different between men and women.
11  This stratification is 
intended to balance the numbers of participants of either gender across treatment arms.  In addition, no more than approximately 70% of the trial population will consist of 1 gender, in order to permit adequate representation of both men and women in the trial population.CCI

Page 424.1.1. Assessment of Safety and Tolerability While Study is Ongoing
In accordance with the sponsor’s standard practices, emerging safety data are reviewed 
periodically in a blinded manner by the sponsor’s clinical team on an ongoing basis during study conduct. An interim analysis of the unblinded safety data by the IRC will occur at least once annually while the study is ongoing, as described in Section 9.5 . In addition, during 
study conduct for Cohorts 1 and 2, there were 3 blinded safety reviews performed by selected members of the sponsor’s study team; each of these blinded safety reviews was separated by at least 1 month from the previous review.
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design
This study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of PF-06882961 in adult participants 
with obesity. After completing initial screening activities in V1, a placebo run-in period (ie, V2 to V3) is included in this study to familiarize participants with the study treatment regimens and to exclude those who are not compliant with single-blinded placebo dosing prior to randomization.  Clinical laboratory tests, assessments of vital signs and 12-lead ECGs, physical examinations, measurement of body weight, waist and hip circumference,AE monitoring, and collection of blood for PK samples will provide data to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and PK of PF-06882961. In order to reduce variability in the assessment of the primary endpoint, body weight, all body weight measurements will be collected in duplicate. Waist and hip circumference
12,13will be measured in triplicate, as 
additional parameters of body weight. Similarly, in an effort to reduce variability and better quantitate potential changes in BP and pulse rate during the study, all measurements of BP and pulse rate will be collected in triplicate and the mean systolic and diastolic BP and mean pulse rate will be reported at each time point.
As part of the clinical safety laboratory tests, calcitonin, amylase, and lipase will be assessed, 
as these laboratory parameters have been shown to increase with marketed GLP-1R agonists.
14-17  In addition, TSH, FT4, lipids, coagulation profile and TBA will be assessed, 
based on non-adverse findings in the nonclinical studies with PF-06882961. Assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior by the C-SSRS
18and PHQ-919will also be performed based on 
the potential risk related to the product labeling for the injectable GLP-1R agonist liraglutide for obesity.
17The collection of blood samples, specifically HbA1c, FPG, and FPI will be 
used to assess changes in glycemic parameters and insulin resistance in this study population.  FPG and FPI levels will be used to calculate HOMA-IR and HOMA-B.

There are 3 cohorts included in this study: Cohort 1 under the original protocol, Cohort 2 added under Amendment 1 and Cohort 3 added under Amendment 2.  Cohort 1 included placebo, 5 PF-06882961 arms with 1-week titration steps, and 3 PF-06882961 arms with 2-week titration steps. For Cohort 2, additional participants were randomized to the placebo and 3 arms with 2-week titration steps.  This cohort was added to better characterize the tolerability and efficacy profile of the 2-week titration schemes, relative to the 1-week titration schemes, with placebo included to maintain the double-blind study design. The study design for Cohorts 1 and 2 was chosen to permit sufficient efficacy

assessment of both arms with 1-week titration steps and arms with 2-week steps. The target

Page 43doses and titration schemes initially utilized in this study were informed by the doses 
administered and tolerability data from the C3421002 study. Cohort 3 is being added under Amendment 2, and includes 4 arms, which are placebo and 3 PF-06882961 arms with 4-week dose titration steps.  This cohort is added to characterize the tolerability and efficacy profile of 4-week titration steps, with placebo included to maintain the double-blind aspect. In this study, the total duration of dosing with randomized double-blinded study intervention is26 weeks for participants in Cohorts 1 and 2, and 32 weeks for participants in Cohort 3. The duration of double-blinded treatment for Cohort 3 is extended to 32 weeks in order to allow for sufficient steady state dosing given the longer titration intervals, and to generate additional efficacy data over a longer treatment period. Downward titration of dosing is not permitted during the study; participants who do not tolerate the titration scheme and/or assigned dose may be required to discontinue dosing of study intervention.  
In accordance with guidelines for the management for obesity,
22all participants will receive 
dietary and physical activity counseling.  GLP-1R agonists typically are not associated with hypoglycemia unless co-administered with 
anti-diabetic agents that can cau se hypoglycemia (such as in sulin or sulfonylureas), which 
are prohibited in this study. Blood glucose concentrations will be monitored throughout the study as part of the safety laboratory measurements.  In addition, all participants will be instructed at placebo run-in and randomization regarding the symptoms associated with, and management of, hypoglycemia, which will pe rmit the monitoring of symptomatic HAEs.
PCOAs have been included to understand how the study intervention affects eating-related factors such as appetite, hunger and food-cravings. Recognizing the wider impact of obesity on patients, additional PRO measures for fatigue, physical function and health-related quality of life have also been included.
23,24
An interim analysis of the unblinded safety data by the IRC will be performed at least once annually while the study is ongoing, and dose level(s) may be dropped if deemed necessary.  See Section 4.1.1 and Section 9.5 for additional information regarding the interim analysis.  
Females of childbearing potential may be enrolled into this study given the availability of embryo fetal developmental toxicity studies with PF-06882961.  However, as marketed GLP-1R agonists are listed as contraindicated in pregnancy, the use of a highly effective 
method of contraception is required and measures will be taken to limit the risk of pregnancy 
in the female population enrolled [see SoA for the applicable cohort ( SoA for Cohorts 1 and 
2, and SoA for Cohort 3) and Appendix 4 ].
The potential risk of exposure to PF-06882961 in a sexual partner of a male participant in this study via ejaculate is low, and therefore no contraception (condom) use in male participants is warranted.  The calculated safety margin is  between the estimated partner exposure due to seminal transfer and the NOAEL for serious manifestations of developmental toxicity in nonclinical studies.  The safety margin of  is based on applying a 10-fold safety factor for interspecies extrapolation and a 10-fold safety factor for susceptible populations.

Page 45The dose range selected for PF-06882961 across all cohorts of this study has been 
demonstrated to be safe with no clinically relevant dose-related adverse trends identified in previous clinical studies and a tolerability profile in line with the mechanism of action (Section 2.2.2.1). The expected PF-06882961 exposure at the highest 200 mg BID dose is 
approximately -fold and -fold lower (for C
maxand AUC 24, respectively) than the 
exposure observed at the NOAEL in the pivotal 9-month toxicology study in monkeys, after accounting for differences in plasma protein binding between species. Based on the above, PF-06882961 doses up to 200 mg BID are viewed as appropriate for assessment in this study with an expected acceptable safety and tolerability profile.

last visit in the treatment phase for the respective cohort (see SoA for Cohorts 1 and 
2, and SoA for Cohort 3), participants should be instructed to arrive fasting for at 
least 8 hours ( without having food/breakfast) and without self-administration of study 
intervention. Note : Participants may take their morning dose of antihypertensive 
medication and/or lipid modifying medication before their visit per their usual routine, if applicable.
•On the mornings of the above visits, the study intervention will be administered at the site with food.  
•Participants will be counseled on appropriate dietary and physical activity guidelines, as described in Section 5.3.2 and Section 5.3.3, for obesity at the times listed in the 
SoA for the applicable cohort (see SoA for Cohorts 1 and 2, and SoA for Cohort 3)
and asked to maintain these guidelines throughout participation in the study.  Note :
Participation in formal weight loss programs should be avoided during participation in this study.
5.3.2. Dietary Counseling
At times listed in the SoA for the applicable cohort (see SoA for Cohorts 1 and 2, and SoA 
for Cohort 3), participants will receive dietary counseli ng by appropriate site staff with 
instruction to induce an energy deficit of ≥500 kcal/day from the participant’s estimated total 
energy expenditure (TEE), in accordance with guidelines,
22using the formula below:
•TEE = Resting energy expenditure (REE) x activity factor.
For all participants, an activity factor of 1.3 (to match a sedentary activity level) will be used.  
The REE for each participant will be calculated with the Harris Benedict formula for men and women, using the participant’s body weight, height, and age obtained at V1, as listed below:
28
•For women: REE (kcal/d) = 655 + 9.5 (weight in kg) + 1.9 (height in cm) – 4.7 (age in years).
•For men: REE (kcal/d) = 66 + 13.8 (weight in kg) + 5.0 (height in cm) – 6.8 (age in 
years).
5.3.3. Physical Activity Counseling
At times listed in the SoA for the applicable cohort (see SoA for Cohorts 1 and 2 , and SoA 
for Cohort 3), participants will be instructed to maintain physical activity for ≥150 minutes 
per week ( ≥30 minutes per day most days of the week) in accordance with guidelines.
22  
Prior to clinical study visits, participants will be instructed not to perform physically 
strenuous exercise (for example: heavy lifting, weight training, calisthenics and aerobics) within 48 hours prior to blood sample collections; walking at a normal pace is permitted.

5.3.5. Contraception
The investigator or his or her designee, in consultation with the participant, will confirm that 
the participant has selected an appropriate method of contraception for the individual participant from the permitted list of contraception methods (see Appendix 4 Section 10.4.4 )
and will confirm that the participant has been instructed in its consistent and correct use.  At time points indicated in the SoA for the applicable cohort (see SoA for Cohorts 1 and 2 , and 
SoA for Cohort 3), the investigator or designee will inform the participant of the need to use highly effective contraception consistently and correctly and document the conversation and the participant’s affirmation in the participant’s chart (participants need to affirm their consistent and correct use of at least 1 of the selected methods of contraception).  In addition, the investigator or designee will instruct the participant to call immediately if the selected contraception method is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the participantor partner.
5.4. Screen Failures
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but 
are not subsequently randomly assigned to study intervention. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the CONSORT publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any SAE.
A participant who qualified for this study but did not enroll within the protocol prescribed 
screening period may be re-screened.  All screening procedures must be repeated, and the participant assigned a new 8-digit SSID number. 
6. STUDY INTERVENTION
Study intervention is defined as any investigational intervention(s), marketed product(s),

Page 53Participants in Cohorts 1 and 2 are instructed to take 4 tablets of study intervention 
(PF-06882961 or matching placebo) in the morning with food and 4 tablets of study intervention in the evening with food, for a total of 8 tablets of study intervention daily.  Participants in Cohort 3 are instructed to take 2 tablets of study intervention (PF-06882961 or matching placebo) in the morning with food and 2 tablets of study intervention in the evening with food, for a total of 4 tablets of study intervention daily.  All participants are instructed to swallow the study intervention whole, and not crush, chew, break or dissolve the study intervention prior to swallowing.  
The morning and evening doses should be taken approximately 10-12 hours apart and at 
approximately the same time each day.  Participants should be instructed that if they forget to take a dose at their usual time, they should take that dose as soon as possible (with food), ensuring that there is at least an 8 hour interval between that dose and the next dose .  If the 
interval to the next dose is less than 8 hours, then the forgotten dose should not be administered.
Dosing and administration instructions along with a dosing diary, will be provided to 
participants to support at home dosing of the study intervention. When participants self-administer the study intervention at home, they will record each dose in the diary.  
Morning dosing will occur at the site with food at V2-V13 for Cohorts 1 and 2 (see SoA for 
Cohorts 1 and 2 ), and at scheduled in-clinic study visits for Cohort 3 (see SoA for Cohort 3).
Participants will be instructed to arrive at the site in the fasted state for each of these visits. 
Participants will be instructed to bring their study intervention supply and dosing diary with them, and to delay self-administration of study intervention until directed to dose during their visit.  When participants dose at the site, they will self-administer the study intervention under supervision by site staff. Onsite dosing will be administered from newly dispensed study intervention, with the exception of the End of Treatment visit (ie, the last dose), which will be administered from study intervention supply brought back to the site by the participant, as no new study intervention is dispensed at the End of Treatment visit. The date and time of each dose administered at the site will be recorded in the site source documents,in the diary and in the CRF.  Additionally, the date and time of the previous 2 doses of double-blinded study intervention prior to each of the pre-dose PK blood collections (ie, the 2 most recent doses prior to the visit as noted in the diary) will be entered in the CRF.
The actual titration schemes for PF-06882961 to be used in this study are provided in Table 1
for Cohorts 1 and 2, and Table 2 for Cohort 3.  Details regarding dose titration are provided 
in the IP Manual.

interventions are provided in the IP manual. All destruction must be adequately 
documented.  If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the investigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Pfizer.
Upon identification of a product complaint, notify the sponsor within 1 business day of discovery as described in the IP Manual.
6.2.1. Preparation and Dispensing
A qualified staff member will dispense the study intervention using the IRT system via 
unique container numbers on the blister cards or bottles provided, in quantities appropriate according to the SoA for the applicable cohort (see SoA for Cohorts 1 and 2, and SoA for 
Cohort 3).  The participant should be instructed to maintain the product in the original containers provided throughout the course of dosing and bring the original containers to the site at the next study visit.
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
6.3.1. Allocation to Study InterventionAssignment of placebo in the run-in period and allocation of participants to treatment groups 
for the double-blind treatment period will proceed through the use of an IRT system (IWR).The site personnel (study coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or select information including but not limited to the user’s ID and password, the protocol number, and the participant number.  For the placebo run-in, the site personnel will then be provided with a DU or container number; for the double-blind treatment period, the site personnel will then be provided with a randomization number, and DU or container number(s). The IRT system will provide a confirmation report containing the participant number, randomization number, and DU or container number(s) assigned.  The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files. 
For Cohort 1, a randomization code using the method of random permuted blocks will be 
utilized to randomize eligible participants in 3:3:3:3:3:3:1:1:1 (placebo: 5 1-week titrationPF-06882961 arms: 3 2-week titration PF-06882961 arms) prior to the first dose of 
double-blinded study intervention.  For the additional participants enrolled as part of 
Cohort 2, a randomization code using the method of random permuted blocks will be utilized to randomize eligible participants in 1:2:2:2 (placebo: 3 2-week titration PF-06882961 arms) prior to the first dose of double-blinded study intervention. For Cohort 3, a randomization code using the method of random permuted blocks will be utilized to randomize eligible participants in 1:2:2:2 (placebo: 3 4-week titration PF-06882961 arms) prior to the first dose of double blinded study intervention. Participants will be randomized to 1 of the blinded study intervention regimens described in Table 3 for Cohorts 1 and 2, and Table 4 for 
Cohort 3.

Page 596.3.2. Breaking the Blind 
The IRT will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions. In case of an emergency, the 
investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participant’s treatment assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the investigator should make every effort to contact the sponsor prior to unblinding a participant’s treatment assignment unless this could delay further management of the participant. If a participant’s treatment assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and CRF.
The study-specific IRT reference manual and IP manual will provide the contact information 
and further details on the use of the IRT system.
6.4. Study Intervention Compliance
Compliance with study intervention will be assessed at each site visit by counting returned 
tablets and this will be documented in the source documents and CRF. Deviation(s) from the prescribed dosage regimen should be recorded in the CRF.
A record of the number of study intervention tablets dispensed to and taken by each 
participant must be maintained and reconciled with study intervention and compliance records.
Compliance (as assessed by tablet count) will be defined as self-administration, by the 
participants, of:
•≥89% of the study-supplied placebo administered during the placebo run-in period.
Based on the visit window, for a run-in that is 11-13 days, 2 missed doses (or fewer)are allowed, and for a run-in that is 14-17 days, 3 missed doses (or fewer) are allowed. Participants who do not meet this compliance threshold are not eligible to be randomized into the study (see Section 5.2 ).
•≥80% of the study supplied from Day 1 through End of Treatment, inclusive.  
Investigators must closely follow non-compliant, randomized, participants in order to enhance their adherence to treatment.  Any participant who fails to meet the criterion of ≥80% compliance will be re-educated by the site staff on the importance of 
compliance with study intervention.
6.5. Concomitant Therapy
Participants in this study will be allowed to be on certain concomitant medications that have 
been prescribed.  Attempts should be made not to alter the doses and regimens of the background medications after randomization and for the duration of participation in this study, except in circumstances where a change in dose is deemed medically necessary.  Any changes must be captured in the CRF.  Additionally, many over-the-counter medications are

Page 60also permitted during this study unless specified as prohibited in Appendix 8, eg, appetite 
suppressants.  
Treatments taken within 28 days before the first dose of randomized study intervention on 
Day 1 will be documented as prior treatment.  Treatments taken after the first dose of randomized study treatment will be documented as concomitant treatment.  
All concomitant treatments, both prescription and over-the-counter taken during the study 
must be recorded with indication, daily dose, and start and stop dates of administration.  All participants will be questioned about concomitant treatment at each clinic visit. 
See Appendix 8 for details regarding prohibited concomitant medications, as well as 
medications with timeframes for restriction prior to V1 or prior to first dose of study 
intervention.  Sites are encouraged to contact the sponsor should there be questions as to whether a medication is permitted or prohibited.
Hormonal contraceptives that meet the requirements of this study are allowed to be used in 
participants who are WOCBP (see Appendix 4 ).
6.5.1. Antihypertensive Medications
The use of background antihypertensive agent(s) is permitted unless otherwise noted in 
Appendix 8.  Doses of antihypertensive agent(s) must be stable for at least 4 weeks prior to screening and throughout the study, except in circumstances where a change in dose is 
deemed medically necessary.  Any changes in doses of these medications must be captured in the CRF. 
6.5.2. Lipid Modifying Medications
The use of background lipid modifying agents is permitted unless otherwise noted in
Appendix 8.  Doses of such lipid modifying agents must be stable for at least 4 weeks prior to screening and throughout the study, except in circumstances where a change in dose is 
deemed medically necessary.  Any changes in doses of these medications must be captured in the CRF.
6.5.3. Rescue Medicine
There is no rescue therapy to reverse the AEs observed with PF-06882961; standard medical 
supportive care should be provided to manage the AEs.
6.6. Dose Modification
6.6.1. Dose Titration
Dose titration schemes are utilized for each study intervention dosing arm in this study as 
described in Section 6.1.1 .  Dose adjustment, either during dose titration or steady state 
dosing, will not be permitted per protocol. Separate materials on participant education andapproaches to manage temporary mechanism of action based gastrointestinal-related AEswill be provided by the sponsor prior to initiation of dosing for Cohort 3.

Page 616.6.2. Considerations for Pausing or Stopping Active Dose(s) Based on Observed Safety
The decision to stop dosing for 1 or more active dose(s) of PF-06882961 may be considered 
based on recommendations from the IRC according to their review of unblinded, study-level emerging, observed safety data (see Section 9.5 ), for reasons such as the following:
•More than 50% of participants develop a moderate or severe AE in the gastrointestinal SOC not responsive to symptomatic management.
6.7. Intervention After the End of the Study
No intervention will be provided to study participants at the end of the study.
7. DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND PARTICIPANT 
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL
7.1. Discontinuation of Study InterventionIt may be necessary for a participant to permanently discontinue study intervention. Reasons 
for permanent discontinuation of study intervention include the following:
•Criteria for a potential Hy’s law case are met (see Appendix 6);
•Intent to become pregnant or pregnancy confirmed by β-hCG testing;
•Safety or tolerability concern arises, in particular if not responsive to symptomatic management, dosing with double-blind study intervention may be stopped in an individual participant at the discretion of the investigator;
•Based on mental health assessment as outlined in Section 8.2.6, should be
discontinued from dosing at the discretion of the investigator.
If the criteria for permanent discontinuation are met, the site should notify the sponsor Medical Monitor or sponsor Clinician.  
Note that discontinuation of study intervention does not represent withdrawal from the study.
If study intervention is definitively discontinued, the participant will remain in the study to be evaluated for obesity, and will be expected to continue with all study visits and assessments as outlined in the SoA for the applicable cohort (see SoA for Cohorts 1 and 2,
andSoA for Cohort 3), with the exception of dosing activities and assessment of PK. See the 
SoA for the applicable cohort (see SoA for Cohorts 1 and 2, and SoA for Cohort 3 ) for data 
to be collected at the time of discontinuation of study intervention and follow-up for any further evaluations that need to be completed.
In the event of discontinuation of study intervention, it must be documented on the 
appropriate CRF/in the medical records whether the participant is discontinuing further receipt of study intervention or also from study procedures, posttreatment study follow-up, and/or future collection of additional information.

Page 627.2. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal From the Study
A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request.  Reasons for 
discontinuation from the study include the following:
•Refused further follow-up;
•Lost to follow-up;
•Death;
•Study terminated by sponsor;
•Safety or behavioral reasons at the discretion of the investigator, including reasons 
related to mental health assessments as described in Section 8.2.6.
At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, an early discontinuation visit should 
be conducted. See the SoA for the applicable cohort (see SoA for Cohorts 1 and 2, and SoA 
for Cohort 3) for assessments to be collected at the time of study discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. 
The early discontinuation visit applies only to participants who are enrolled/randomized and 
then are prematurely withdrawn from the study.  Participants should be questioned regarding their reason for withdrawal.  The participant will be permanently discontinued both from the study intervention and from the study at that time.
If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any remaining 
samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document any such requests in the site study records and notify the sponsor accordingly.
If the participant withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent (see Section 7.2.1 ) 
for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed and no 
additional data should be collected.  The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent.
Lack of completion of all or any of the withdrawal/early termination procedures will not be 
viewed as protocol deviations so long as the participant’s safety was preserved.
7.2.1. Withdrawal of Consent 
Participants who request to discontinue receipt of study intervention will remain in the study 
and must continue to be followed for protocol-specified follow-up procedures.  The only exception to this is when a participant specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him or her or persons previously authorized by the participant to provide this information.  Participants should notify the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw consent from future follow-up, whenever possible.  The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the investigator, as to whether the

Page 63withdrawal is only from further receipt of study intervention or also from study procedures 
and/or posttreatment study follow-up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page.  In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in accordance with local law.
7.3. Lost to Follow-up 
A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for/attend a 
required study visit:
•The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study.
•Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record.
•Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study. 
8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
The investigator (or an appropriate delegate at the investigator site) must obtain a signed and 
dated ICD before performing any study-specific procedures.  
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA for the applicable cohort (see 
SoA for Cohorts 1 and 2, and SoA for Cohort 3). Protocol waivers or exemptions are not 
allowed.
Safety issues should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or 
awareness to determine whether the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention.
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA for the 
applicable cohort (see SoA for Cohorts 1 and 2, and SoA for Cohort 3), is essential and 
required for study conduct.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
CT02-GSOP Clinical Protocol Template Phase 1 2 3 4 (05 December 2019)
Page 64All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
Every effort should be made to ensure that protocol-required tests and procedures are 
completed as described.  However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances outside the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test.  In these cases, the investigator must take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the participant.  When a protocol-required test cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason for the missed test and any corrective and preventive actions that he or she has taken to ensure that required processes are adhered to as soon as possible.  The study team must be informed of these incidents in a timely manner.
For samples being collected and shipped, detailed collection, processing, storage, and 
shipment instructions and contact information will be provided to the investigator site prior to initiation of the study.
The total blood sampling volume for individual participants who complete the study is 
approximately 280 mL. The actual collection times of blood sampling may change.  Additional blood samples may be taken for safety assessments at times specified by the sponsor, provided the total volume taken during the study does not exceed 550 mL during any period of 60 consecutive days.
8.1. Efficacy Assessments
Efficacy assessments for this study include measurements of body weight, waist 
circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio (calculated from waist and hip circumference measurements). In addition, PCOAs will be completed to assess how the participants feel and function.
8.1.1. Primary Efficacy Parameter: Body Weight
Body weight is the primary efficacy assessment for this study.  Body weight will be 
measured in duplicate as indicated in the SoA for the applicable cohort (see SoA for 
Cohorts 1 and 2 , and SoA for Cohort 3). The second weight measurement should be 
obtained at least 1-2 minutes apart from the first weight measurement.
Weight will be recorded using a calibrated scale (with the same scale used as much as 
practically possible for the duration of the study) reporting weight in either pounds (lb) or kilograms (kg), and accuracy to the nearest 0.2 lb (or 0.1 kg); ie, the device must be able to distinguish a difference between 150.4 lb (68.4 kg) versus 150.2 lb (68.3 kg). Calibration of the scale must occur within 3 months prior to study initiation at the site and at least every 6 months during study conduct. The scale must be placed on a stable, flat surface.
Weight measurement should be taken under the following conditions:

Page 65•Participant is in a fasted state (see Section 5.3.1 );
•After the participant has been asked to void of urine (ie, forced void);
•After the participant has removed shoes and bulky layers of clothing and jackets so 
that only light clothing (with empty pockets) or a hospital gown remains; 
•With the participant standing still while on the scale.
8.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Parameters: Waist and Hip Circumference
Waist and hip circumference will be measured at the times specified in the SoA for the 
applicable cohort (see SoA for Cohorts 1 and 2, and SoA for Cohort 3) and will be used to 
calculate the waist-to-hip ratio.  The waist circumference is defined as the abdominal circumference located at the approximate midpoint between the lower margin of the last palpable rib and the top of the iliac crest.  The hip circumference is defined as the circumference around the widest portion of the buttocks.
12,13
Waist and hip measurements should be taken under the following conditions:
•Participant is in a fasted state (see Section 5.3.1 );
•After the participant has been asked to void of urine (ie, forced void);
•With the participant wearing light clothing or a hospital gown that allows access for the measurements to be taken with the tape touching the skin (not clothing) for waist measurements, and the tape touching the skin if possible for hip measurements;
•While the  participant is standing with their feet close together, their weight equally distributed to each leg, and arms at their side but with waist and hips accessible;
•After the participant has been asked to breathe normally; the reading of the measurement should be taken at the end of a normal exhalation.
These measurements will be obtained using an anthropometric tape (stretch-resistant). The tape should be snug around the body, but not pulled so tight that it is constricting.  The tape should be in the horizontal all around the body, parallel to the floor at the level at which the measurement is made and avoiding twists in the tape. The waist and hip circumference will be measured in triplicate,
12with a brief interval (at least 1-2 minutes) between successive 
measurements. All 3 measurements will be recorded in inches or cm, rounded to the nearest 1/16
thinch or 0.1 cm.

The SF-36v2®33is a 36-item questionnaire that measures functional health and well-being 
from a patient’s perspective. It is a generic questionnaire and can be used across age (adults), 
disease, and treatment groups.  The questionnaire consists of 8 health domain scales: physical 
functioning (10 items), role-physical (4 items), bodily pain (2 items), general health 
(5 items), vitality (4 items), social functioning (2 items), role-emotional (3 items), mental health (5 items), reported health transition (1 item) and 2, physical and mental component summary scores.  Each health domain scale raw score is transformed to 0-100 scale which can then be converted to norm-based T scores (Mean=50, SD=10) using scoring software 
provided by the developer, where full derivation details will be provided in the SAP.

Page 698.2. Safety Assessments
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA for the applicable 
cohort (see SoA for Cohorts 1 and 2, and SoA for Cohort 3).  Unscheduled clinical laboratory 
measurements may be obtained at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety issues.
8.2.1. Physical Examinations
Physical examinations are performed as indicated in the SoA for the applicable cohort (see 
SoA for Cohorts 1 and 2, and SoA for Cohort 3). 
Physical examinations may be conducted by a physician, trained physician’s assistant or nurse practitioner as acceptable and according to local regulation.  A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the participant’s general appearance, head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, throat, neck (including thyroid examination), skin, heart and lung examinations, lymph nodes, as well as gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal and neurological systems.
Height will be measured after the participant has removed their shoes and will be collected at 
V1 only.  
A limited physical examination is performed at the in-clinic follow-up visit and may be 
performed at non-specified visits if there are findings during the previous physical examination or new/open AEs, if appropriate and at investigator discretion.  The limited physical examination will be focused on general appearance, lungs, heart, and participant reported symptoms.
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses.
8.2.2. Vital Signs
8.2.2.1. Blood Pressure and Pulse RateIn this study, assessment of vital signs (systolic BP, diastolic BP, and pulse rate) will occur at 
the nominal time points specified in the SoA for the applicable cohort (see SoA for Cohorts 1 
and 2, and SoA for Cohort 3) per the following specifications:
•At V1, the participant’s arm circumference should be measured (eg, using ananthropometric tape) at the midpoint of the length of the upper arm and the appropriate cuff selected and used throughout the study. 
•BP and pulse rate will be measured via an automated device using an oscillometric method (not auscultation).

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
CT02-GSOP Clinical Protocol Template Phase 1 2 3 4 (05 December 2019)
Page 70•Assessment of BP and pulse rate can be manual (rather than using an automated 
device), only if an automated device is not available; however, when done manually pulse rate must be measured in the brachial/radial artery for at least 30 seconds.
•Supine BP and pulse rate will be measured with the participant’s arm supported at the level of the heart, following a rest of at least 5 minutes and BP will be recorded to the nearest mm Hg. Triplicate assessments will be measured, with an interval of at least 1-2 minutes between each measurement, and these will be performed pre-dose (as applicable) at each planned in-clinic study visit. For visits with post-dose PK collections as specified in the SoA for the applicable cohort (see SoA for Cohorts 1 
and 2, and SoA for Cohort 3), these triplicate assessments will also be performed 1 time within the window of approximately 2-6 hours post-dose (around the same time as post-dose PK samples are collected and according to the chronology in Appendix 9). Each triplicate reading will be recorded, and the average of the 3 measurements at V3 (Day 1) will serve as the participant’s baseline.  
•Same arm (preferably the dominant arm) will be used for BP and pulse rateassessments throughout the study, whenever possible.
•Participants should be instructed not to speak during BP and pulse rate measurements.
•See Appendix 9 for proposed chronology of procedures for nominal time points when 
vital sign assessments coincide with other procedures. 
Additional collection times, or changes to collection times of BP and pulse rate will be permitted, as necessary, to ensure appropriate collection of safety data.
8.2.3. Electrocardiograms
Standard 12-lead ECGs should be collected at times specified in the SoA section of this 
protocol for the applicable cohort (see SoA for Cohorts 1 and 2, and SoA for Cohort 3) using 
an ECG machine that automatically calculates the HR and measures PR, QT, and QTcFintervals and QRS complex. All scheduled ECGs should be performed after the participant has rested quietly for at least 10 minutes in a supine position, and prior to dosing (as applicable), according to the chronology in Appendix 9 . 
If a) a post-dose QTcF interval remains ≥30 msec from the baseline andis >450 msec; or 
b) an absolute QTcF value is ≥ 500 msec for any scheduled ECG for greater than 4 hours 
(or sooner, at the discretion of the investigator); or c) QTcF intervals get progressively longer, the participant should undergo continuous ECG monitoring (eg, cardiac telemetry or frequent ECG ascertainment as per investigator’s medical judgment).  A cardiologist should be consulted if QTcF intervals do not return to less than the criteria listed above after 8 hours of monitoring (or sooner, at the discretion of the investigator).

Page 71In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality.  It is important that leads be placed in the same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings.  If a machine-read QTcF value is prolonged, as defined above, repeat measurements may not be necessary if a qualified medical provider’s interpretation determines that the QTcF values are in the acceptable range.
ECG values of potential clinical concern are listed in Appendix 7 .
8.2.4. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
See Appendix 2 for the list of clinical safety laboratory tests to be performed and the SoA for 
the applicable cohort (see SoA for Cohorts 1 and 2, and SoA for Cohort 3) for the timing and 
frequency. All protocol-required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2 , must be 
conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA for the applicable cohort 
(seeSoA for Cohorts 1 and 2 , and SoA for Cohort 3). Unscheduled clinical laboratory 
measurements may be obtained at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety issues.  
The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition.
All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study or within 28 to 35 days after the last dose of study intervention should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator or medical monitor.
If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by 
the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified.
See Appendix 6 for suggested actions and follow-up assessments in the event of potential
DILI.8.2.5. Management of Hypoglycemia
While hypoglycemia is not expected in the study participants, FPG will be measured at each 
clinic visit via the central lab. In addition, as a precaution, participants will be instructed to 
recognize the signs and symptoms associated with hypoglycemia. 
Any episode of hypoglycemia must be captured on the AE CRF with specific details captured 
on the HAE Form CRF.  For the definition of a hypoglycemic episode and severity 
categorization see Section 8.2.5.1 below.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
CT02-GSOP Clinical Protocol Template Phase 1 2 3 4 (05 December 2019)
Page 728.2.5.1. Definition and Severity of Hypoglycemic Adverse Event (HAE)
The investigator must assess the glucose values reported by the central laboratory, as well as 
any signs or symptoms reported by the study participant.
HAE is defined as one of the following:34
a. Asymptomatic hypoglycemia: An event not accompanied by typical symptoms of 
HAE but a glucose value of <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) using either glucometer 
(fingerstick blood glucose) at the study site or sponsor-identified central laboratory (plasma glucose).
b. Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia: An event during which typical symptoms 
of HAE are accompanied with a glucose value of <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), using glucometer at the study site or sponsor identified central laboratory, and the clinical picture includes prompt resolution with food intake, subcutaneous glucagon, or IV glucose.
c. Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia: An event during which symptoms of HAE are 
not accompanied by a glucose determination but was presumably caused by a glucose concentration of <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), and the clinical picture includes prompt resolution with food intake, subcutaneous glucagon, or IV glucose.
Each episode of HAE must be categorized with respect to severity.  In order to characterize the event as severe, all 3 criteria below must be met:
1. The participant was unable to treat him/herself.  Neurologic impairment, and not the 
age of the participant, is the explanation for why the participant could not treat him/herself and required the assistance of another person.
2. The participant exhibited at least 1 of the following neurological symptoms:
•Memory loss;
•Confusion;
•Uncontrolled behavior;
•Irrational behavior;
•Unusual difficulty in awakening;
•Suspected seizure;
•Seizure;
•Loss of consciousness.

Page 733. Either:
•If blood glucose was measured and was ≤54 mg/dL (2.7 mmol/L) using 
glucometer (or central laboratory); or
•If blood glucose was not measured, the clinical manifestations were reversed by 
oral carbohydrates, subcutaneous glucagon, or IV glucose.
Events that do not meet all the criteria above for severe HAE are characterized as mild or moderate in severity.
8.2.6. Mental Health Questionnaires 
8.2.6.1. Columbia Suicide Severi ty Rating Scale (C-SSRS)
The C-SSRS is an interview-based rating scale to systematically assess suicidal ideation and 
suicidal behavior.
18  The “baseline/screening” version of the C-SSRS will be administered at 
V1.  The “since last visit” version of the C-SSRS will be administered at the other visits specified in the SoA for the applicable cohort (see SoA for Cohorts 1 and 2, and SoA for 
Cohort 3).  The C-SSRS will be administered by study site staff who have completed training in its administration. Participants who respond “yes” to questions 4 or 5 (indicating suicidal ideation), or to any suicidal behavioral question on the C-SSRS at V1, V2 or V3 will not be permitted in the study (see Section 5.2 ).
8.2.6.1.1. Rater Qualifications
For specific rating assessments, only qualified raters will be allowed to evaluate and/or rate 
participants in this study.  The minimum qualifications a rater must meet will be outlined in a guidance document provided to each participating site.  The level of experience with the target population (or equivalent), specific scale experience (or equivalent), and certification required (if applicable) will be listed and used to determine whether a rater is approved for a given assessment.  The rater must become certified to perform selected study assessments before he or she can participate in the conduct of the study.  For specifically defined assessments, rater training and standardization exercises may be conducted, and written and signed documentation will be provided by the site for each rater’s certification.  In return, each site will be provided written and signed documentation outlining each rater’s certification for specific study assessments.  Recertification may be required at periodic intervals during the study.  The raters who administer specific study assessments will be documented in a centralized location and all site staff who administer ratings will be verified in the site study documentation during the conduct of the study.
8.2.6.2. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)
The PHQ-9 is a 9 item self-report scale for the assessment of depressive symptoms.
19  The 
PHQ-9 will be completed by participants and reviewed by site staff at the pre-defined time 
points outlined in the SoA for the applicable cohort (see SoA for Cohorts 1 and 2 , and SoA 
for Cohort 3).  A PHQ-9 score of ≥15 at V1, V2 or V3 indicates clinically significant depression and serves as an exclusion criterion for this study (see Section 5.2).

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
CT02-GSOP Clinical Protocol Template Phase 1 2 3 4 (05 December 2019)
Page 748.2.6.3. Referral to a Mental Health Professional
A participant should be referred to a MHP for any of the following reasons:
•Response of “yes” to question 4 or 5, or on any behavioral question on the C-SSRS;
•A score of ≥15 on the PHQ-9;
•In the investigator’s judgment a risk assessment or exclusion is required.
A clinically-qualified MHP is a MHP with appropriate training in the assessment of suicide 
risk, according to local clinical practice standards and regulations, who would normally evaluate the risk for suicidal ideation and behavior in a patient.
Participants who have recurrent suicidal ideation or behavior during the study should be 
discontinued from the study and treated appropriately. If a study participant endorses a 4 or 5 on the ideation subscale or any behavioral item of the C-SSRS on 2 or more occasions and is confirmed to have active suicidal ideation or behavior on both occasions by a risk assessment conducted by a qualified MHP, then the participant should be discontinued from the study and treated appropriately.
Participants who meet criteria for referral to a MHP, but refuse evaluation and/or treatment 
by a MHP, must be assessed by the investigator to determine if the participant should be discontinued from dosing or from the study.
8.2.7. Pregnancy Testing 
Pregnancy tests will be both urine and serum, and must have a sensitivity of at least 
25 mIU/mL.  Pregnancy tests will be performed in all females at the times listed in the SoAfor the applicable cohort (see SoA for Cohorts 1 and 2 , and SoA for Cohort 3).  Following a 
negative pregnancy test result at screening, appropriate contraception must be commenced and a second negative pregnancy test result will be required at the baseline visit prior the participant’s receiving the study intervention.  Pregnancy tests will also be done whenever 1 menstrual cycle is missed during the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected) and at the end of the study.  Pregnancy tests may also be repeated if requested by IRBs/ECs or if required by local regulations.  
8.3. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
The definitions of an AE and an SAE can be found in Appendix 3 .
AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or 
the participant's legally authorized representative).
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible to pursue and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcome and to assess whether the 

PF-06882961

CT02-GSOP Clinical Protocol Template Phase 1 2 3 4 (05 December 2019)
Page 75event meets the criteria for classification as an SAE or caused the participant to discontinue 
the study intervention (see Section 7.1 ). 
Each participant will be questioned about the occurrence of AEs in a nonleading manner.
In addition, the investigator may be requested by Pfizer Safety to obtain specific follow-up 
information in an expedited fashion.
8.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each participant begins from the time the participant provides informed consent, which is obtained before the participant’s participation in the study (ie, before undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving study intervention), through and including a minimum of 28 calendar days after the last administration of the study intervention.
Follow-up by the investigator continues throughout and after the active collection period and 
until the AE or SAE or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator.
For participants who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure 
status is determined.
If the participant withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for the collection of 
future information, the active collection period ends when consent is withdrawn.
If a participant permanently discontinues or temporarily discontinues study intervention 
because of an AE or SAE, the AE or SAE must be recorded on the CRF and the SAE reported using the CT SAE Report Form.
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after the participant has 
concluded study participation.  However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has completed the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention, the investigator must promptly report the SAE to Pfizer using the CT SAE Report Form.
8.3.1.1. Reporting SAEs to Pfizer Safety
All SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period as described in 
Section 8.3.1 are reported to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form immediately upon 
awareness and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in 
Appendix 3. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 
24 hours of it being available.

Page 768.3.1.2. Recording Nonserious AEs and SAEs on the CRF
All nonserious AEs and SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period, 
which begins after obtaining informed consent as described in Section 8.3.1 will be recorded 
on the AE section of the CRF. 
The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly observed and all spontaneously reported 
AEs and SAEs reported by the participant.
8.3.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3 .
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs.  Open-ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences.
8.3.3. Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3 ).
In general, follow-up information will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality.  Any information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided.  In the case of a participant death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer Safety.
Further information on follow-up procedures is given in Appendix 3 .
8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation.  The sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs/ECs, and investigators.
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for SUSARs according to local regulatory 
requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary.

Page 77An investigator who receives SUSARs or other specific safety information (eg, summary or 
listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the SRSD(s) for the study and will notify the IRB/EC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
8.3.5. Exposure During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and Occupational Exposure
Exposure to the study intervention under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding and 
occupational exposure are reportable to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of investigator awareness.
8.3.5.1. Exposure During Pregnancy
An EDP occurs if: 
•A female participant is found to be pregnant while receiving or after discontinuing 
study intervention.
•A male participant who is receiving or has discontinued study intervention exposes a female partner prior to or around the time of conception.
•A female is found to be pregnant while being exposed or having been exposed to study intervention due to environmental exposure. Below are examples of environmental EDP: 
•A female family member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant after 
having been exposed to the study intervention by ingestion.
•A male family member or healthcare provider who has been exposed to the study intervention by ingestion then exposes his female partner prior to or around the time of conception.
The investigator must report EDP to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The initial information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy). 
•If EDP occurs in a participant or a participant’s partner, the investigator must report 
this information to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP 
Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. Details of the pregnancy will be collected after the start of study intervention and until 28 calendar days after the last administration of IP.
•If EDP occurs in the setting of environmental exposure, the investigator must report information to Pfizer Safety using the CT SAE Report Form and EDP Supplemental Form. Since the exposure information does not pertain to the participant enrolled in the study, the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed CT SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
CT02-GSOP Clinical Protocol Template Phase 1 2 3 4 (05 December 2019)
Page 78Follow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer Safety of the outcome as a follow-up to the initial EDP Supplemental Form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless preprocedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes are considered SAEs. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets 
the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to Pfizer Safety as SAEs follows: 
•Spontaneous abortion including miscarriage and missed abortion;
•Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the study intervention. 
Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by the sponsor. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis (eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the participant with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source documents that the participant was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner.
8.3.5.2. Exposure During Breastfeeding
An exposure during breastfeeding occurs if: 
•A female participant is found to be breastfeeding while receiving or after 
discontinuing study intervention.
•A female is found to be breastfeeding while being exposed or having been exposed to study intervention (ie, environmental exposure). An example of environmental exposure during breastfeeding is a female family member or healthcare provider who reports that she is breastfeeding after having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact.

Page 79The investigator must report exposure during breastfeeding to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours 
of the investigator’s awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The information must be reported using the CT SAE Report Form. When exposure during breastfeeding occurs in the setting of environmental exposure, the exposure information does not pertain to the participant enrolled in the study , so the information is not recorded on a 
CRF. However, a copy of the completed CT SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a Pfizer drug specifically 
approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with authorized use. However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such a drug, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.
8.3.5.3. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when a person receives unplanned direct contact with the 
study intervention, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE.  Such persons 
may include healthcare providers, family members, and other roles that are involved in the trial participant’s care.
The investigator must report occupational exposure to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, regardless of whether there is an associated SAE.  The information must be reported using the CT SAE Report Form.  Since the information does not pertain to a participant enrolled in the study, the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed CT SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file.

Medication errors include:
•Medication errors involving participant exposure to the study intervention;
•Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do or do not involve the study participant.
Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page.
In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified within 24 hours.Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by an AE, as determined by the 
investigator, the medication error is recorded on the medication error page of the CRF and, if applicable, any associated AE(s), serious and nonserious, are recorded on the AE page of the CRF.
Medication errors should be reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours on a CT SAE Report 
Form only when associated with an SAE.
8.4. Treatment of Overdose
For this study, any dose of study intervention greater than tablets for Cohorts 1 and 2, or
tablets for Cohort 3, within a 24-hour time period will be considered an overdose.
There is no specific antidote for overdose with PF-06882961.  Treatment of overdose should 
consist of general supportive measures.
In the event of an overdose, the investigator/treating physician should:

Page 812. Closely monitor the participant for any AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities for at 
least 5 half-lives or 28 calendar days after the overdose of PF-06882961 (whichever 
is longer).
3. Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose in 
the CRF.
4. Overdose is reportable to Safety only when associated with an SAE.
5. Obtain a blood sample for PK analysis within 2 days from the date of the last dose of 
study intervention if requested by the medical monitor (determined on a case-by-case basis).
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the medical monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant.
8.5. Pharmacokinetics 
Blood samples of approximately 3 mL each, to provide sufficient plasma for PK analysis, 
will be collected into appropriately labeled tubes containing K
2EDTA, at times defined in the 
SoA for the applicable cohort (see SoA for Cohorts 1 and 2, and SoA for Cohort 3) and 
according to the chronology in Appendix 9, with collections occurring prior to dosing with 
study intervention on the given scheduled visit, and also 1 time within the window of 
approximately 2 to 6 hours post-dose at specific visits noted in the SoA (ie, also collected post-dose for Cohorts 1 and 2 at V3, V7, V10 and V13, and for Cohort 3 at V3, V7, V11, V15 and V19).  The date/time of the blood collections related to PK (both pre- and post-dose samples) should be noted in source documents and captured in the CRF.  
Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided in the 
laboratory manual.  To maintain sample integrity:
•Any deviations from the PK sample handling procedures (eg, sample collection and processing steps, interim storage or shipping conditions), including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the sponsor.  On a case-by-case basis, the sponsor may make a determination as to whether sample integrity has been compromised.  Any deviation from the specified sample handling procedure resulting in compromised sample integrity will be considered a protocol deviation; 
•Any scheduled pre-dose collection (ie, trough concentration) obtained post dose or any post dose samples not collected within the approximately 2-6 hours post dose interval, will be captured as a protocol deviation even if results are deemed evaluable.
As part of understanding the PK of the study intervention, samples may be used for metabolite identification and/or evaluation of the bioanalytical method, as well as for other internal exploratory purposes. These data will not be included in the clinical report.

9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study 
is outlined here and further detailed in a SAP, which will be maintained by the sponsor.  The SAP may modify what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definitions or their analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.  Data from participants enrolled into the original cohort (Cohort 1) and Cohort 2 will be combined for reporting, where data from the placebo and 2-week titration arms will be combined from the 2 cohorts and analyzed together. Data from participants enrolled into Cohort 3 will be analyzed separately unless otherwise specified.
9.1. Estimands and Statistical Hypotheses
Estimands related to percent CFB in body weight:
The primary estimand (Estimand 1) will be the population average treatment effect on the 
percent CFB in body weight at End of Treatment of PF-06882961 compared to placebo in all evaluable participants while on treatment. For Cohorts 1 and 2, End of Treatment is defined as Week 26. For Cohort 3, End of Treatment is defined as Week 32. This reflects a combination of the ‘Hypothetical’ and ‘While on treatment’ strategies as outlined in the ICH-E9 (R1) guidance.
35
Measurements after discontinuation of study intervention will be censored and treated as missing data.  Missing data due to censoring, study withdrawal or other reasons  will have 
data imputed based on a MAR assumption.  The population-based treatment effect will be the 
mean percent CFB in each PF-06882961 arm compared to placebo.  This estimand will similarly be applied to the percent changes from baseline in body weight at all time points through to End of Treatment. For all cohorts, all randomized participants  who take at least 1 dose of study intervention will be included. 

PF-06882961
Protocol C3421019Final Protocol Amendm ent 2, 16 September 2022
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
CT02-GSOP Clinical Protocol Template Phase 1 2 3 4 (05 December 2019)
Page 84An additional exploratory estimand (Estimand 7) will be analyzed, which will be the 
population average treatment effect on the percent CFB in body weight at End of Treatmentof PF-06882961 compared to placebo in evaluable participants with no major protocol deviations and while on treatment. This reflects a combination of the ‘Hypothetical’, ‘While on treatment’ and ‘Principal stratum’ strategies as outlined in the ICH-E9 (R1) guidance.
35
This is the same as Estimand 1 except that participants with major protocol deviations (eg, inadequate study intervention compliance, use of prohibited medication, etc.) will be excluded from this analysis. Major protocol deviations will be reviewed prior to database lock to identify such participants, with further details included in the SAP. 
Estimands related to achieving body weight loss ≥5% at End of Treatment:
A secondary estimand (Estimand 2) will be the population odds ratio of the treatment effect 
of achieving a body weight loss ≥5% from baseline at End of Treatment of PF-06882961 
compared to placebo in all evaluable participants while on treatment.  This reflects a combination of the ‘Hypothetical’ and ‘While on treatment’ strategies as outlined in the ICH-E9 (R1) guidance.
35
Measurements after discontinuation of study intervention will be censored and treated as missing data.  Missing data due to censoring, study withdrawal, or other reasons (eg, laboratory failure) may be imputed as outlined in the SAP.  The population-based treatment effect will be the odds of achieving a body weight loss ≥5% from baseline at End 
of Treatment on PF-06882961 compared to the odds of achieving this on placebo (ie, odds ratio).
Estimands related to other endpoints:Estimand 3 is similar to Estimand 1, except the population average treatment effect is on the 
absolute CFB in waist circumference at End of Treatment. The population based treatment effect will be the mean CFB in each PF-06882961 arm compared to placebo. 
Estimands 4, 5 and 6 will utilize the same approach as Estimand 3 for the associated 
endpoint(s).
Tertiary endpoints may be analyzed using similar estimands or analyzed in a descriptive 
manner without reference to an estimand.  Other supporting estimands may be used for some of the primary and secondary endpoints as a means to examine the robustness of results, 
compare to available literature and/or be used for future study planning as needed.  Details of 
these estimands and analyses will be presented in the SAP. 
9.2. Sample Size Determination
For Cohort 1, the sample size was based on the need to have an adequately sized safety 
database of participants on PF-06882961 in an obese population up to 26 weeks of dosing following Phase 2 clinical development. Approximately 420 participants (approximately60 in each of the placebo and 5 PF-06882961 arms with 1-week titration steps and 

PF-06882961

CT02-GSOP Clinical Protocol Template Phase 1 2 3 4 (05 December 2019)
Page 85approximately 20 in each of the 3 PF-06882961 arms with 2-week titration steps) were to be 
randomized in the original cohort (Cohort 1).  The sample size of Cohort 1 also providedacceptable operating characteristics for decision making based on the primary endpoint, the percent CFB at End of Treatment in body weight.  
For Cohort 1, assuming a 25% drop-out rate there would be expected to be approximately
315 completed participants, with approximately 45 completed participants per arm for each of the placebo and 1-week titration PF-06882961 arms.  For End of Treatment defined as Week 26, this yields 80% power to detect a placebo-adjusted reduction in body weight of 
% (comparing PF-06882961 to placebo), using a 1-sided t-test at a 5% level and assuming 
a conservative SD on the loge-scale of for body weight change at Week 26, based on historical internal studies.
For Cohort 2, approximately 49 additional participants were to be randomized to the placebo 
and 2-week titration PF-06882961 arms (approximately 7 in the placebo and approximately 14 in each of the 3 2-week titration arms). This sample size was selected to provide additional tolerability data on the 2-week titration arms and provide improved operating characteristics of the primary endpoint.
Assuming a 25% drop-out rate, with the combination of placebo and the 2-week titration 
arms from both Cohorts 1 and 2 (approximately 67 participants randomized to placebo and approximately 34 participants in each of the 2-week titration arms in total) there would be expected to be approximately 50 completed placebo participants and approximately 25 completed participants in each of the 2-week titration arms. For End of Treatment defined as Week 26, this yields 80% power to detect a placebo-adjusted reduction in body weight of 
% (comparing a 2-week titration arm of PF-06882961 to placebo), using a 1-sided t-test at 
a 5% level, and assuming a conservative SD on the log
e-scale of  for body weight 
change at Week 26, based on historical internal studies.
For Cohort 3, approximately 112 additional participants will be randomized (approximately 
16 in the placebo and approximately 32 in each of the 3 PF-06882961 arms with 4-week titration steps). This sample size was selected to provide additional tolerability data using 4-week titration steps and provide acceptable operating characteristics for the primary endpoint. Assuming a discontinuation rate of 25%, it is expected that approximately 84 of 
these participants will complete the study, with approximately 12 completing the placebo 
arm and approximately 24 completing each of the PF-06882961 arms. For End of Treatment defined as Week 32, this yields 80% power to detect a placebo-adjusted reduction in body weight of % (comparing PF-06882961 to placebo) at Week 32, using a 1-sided t-test at a 5% level and assuming a conservative SD on the log
e-scale of for body weight change at
Week 32, based on historical internal studies. If judged necessary by the sponsor to meet study objectives (for example, if the rate of discontinuation or rate of non-compliance is higher than anticipated), then up to approximately 140 participants may be randomized into Cohort 3, to ensure a sufficient number of completing participants.  
Participants who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  Evaluable participants are 
defined as in Section 9.3 .CCI

Page 869.3. Analysis Sets
For purposes of analysis, the following analysis sets are defined for the combined Cohorts 1 
and 2, and separately for Cohort 3:
Participant Analysis Set Description
Enrolled "Enrolled" means a participant's agreement to participate in 
a clinical study following completion of the informed consent process.  Potential participants who are screened for the purpose of determining eligibility for the study, but do not participate in the study, are not considered enrolled, unless otherwise specified by the protocol.
Randomly assigned to study interventionAll participants randomly assigned to study intervention regardless of whether or not study intervention was administered.
Evaluable All participants randomly assigned to study intervention 
and who take at least 1 dose of study intervention.  Participants will be analyzed according to the randomized study intervention.
Safety All participants randomly assigned to study intervention
and who take at least 1 dose of study intervention.  Participants will be analyzed according to the study intervention they actually received.
Defined Analysis Set Description
Estimand Set 1 (related to estimands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6)All participants randomly assigned to study intervention and who take at least 1 dose of study intervention.  For participants who discontinue study intervention, all subsequent values will be censored.
Estimand Set 2 (related to estimand 7)All participants randomly assigned to study intervention and who take at least 1 dose of study intervention and do not have major protocol deviations. Major protocol deviations will be reviewed prior to database lock to identify such participants, with further details included in the SAP.

who take at least 1 dose of PF-06882961 and in whom at least 
1 concentration value is reported.  
9.4. Statistical Analyses
The SAP will be developed and finalized before any analyses are performed and will 
describe the analyses and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data.  This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints.
9.4.1. General Considerations
Cohorts 1 and 2 will generally be analyzed separately from Cohort 3, with all treatment arms 
of PF-06882961 and placebo analyzed separately. For Cohorts 1 and 2, reporting of the placebo and the 2-week titration PF-06882961 arms will be based on the combined set of participants from both cohorts, ie, the original cohort (Cohort 1) and Cohort 2.
For Cohorts 1 and 2, End of Treatment is defined as Week 26. For Cohort 3, End of 
Treatment is defined as Week 32.
9.4.1.1. Analyses for Continuous Endpoints
The MMRM model(s) will include treatment, time, strata (females versus males) and 
treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects, baseline as a covariate and the baseline-by-time interaction with time fitted as a repeated effect and participant as a random effect. An unstructured correlation matrix will be used, and the Kenward-Roger approximation will be used for estimating degrees of freedom for the model parameters.
Missing values will be imputed as part of the MMRM model assumptions.9.4.1.2. Analyses for Categorical Endpoints
The logistic regression model(s) will include a term for treatment, strata (females versus 
males), and baseline will be included as a covariate.  
Missing values will be imputed using multiple imputation where the model will include 
treatment, baseline and strata (females vs. males) and will include all time course data up to Week 26 or Week 32, depending on the cohort. The logistic regression model will be applied to each imputed dataset and the parameter estimates will be combined using standard multiple imputation techniques. Further details will be described in the SAP.
9.4.2. Primary Endpoint(s)
A MMRM analysis (as per Section 9.4.1) of the percent CFB in body weight through End of 
Treatment will be used to estimate the treatment effect related to the primary Estimand 1.
MMRM models will be fitted to the combined Cohorts 1 and 2 data and separately to the Cohort 3 data. Baseline body weight will be included on the log
e-scale. The MMRM models

and 26 for Cohorts 1 and 2 or Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32 for Cohort 3 from the 
Estimand Set 1. The modelled mean log e-differences and 90% CIs for the log e-differences at
the End of Treatment timepoint will be extracted from the model and exponentiated to provide estimates of the relative difference in each PF-06882961 treatment arm reported separately, compared to placebo.
No adjustments will be made for multiplicity.9.4.3. Secondary Endpoint(s)
For the secondary endpoints described below in the table, models will be fitted to the 
combined Cohorts 1 and 2 data, and separately to the Cohort 3 data.
Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods
Secondary: Response as defined by a body weight loss ≥5% at End of 
Treatment.A logistic regression analysis utilizing multiple imputation for missing values (as per Section 9.4.1.2 ) of participants who achieved 
a body weight loss ≥5% at the End of Treatment timepoint and 
those that didn’t will be used to estimate the treatment effect related to the secondary estimand 2. Baseline body weight will be included in the logistic regression and multiple imputation analyses.
The logistic regression model will be fitted to the End of Treatment
timepoint only after multiple imputation has been applied to Estimand Set 1.  No adjustments will be made for multiplicity.
Secondary: Percent CFB in body weight at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 18 and 22 for Cohorts 1 and 2, and at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 28 for Cohort 3Results related to this endpoint will be obtained from the Primary Analysis model.
No adjustments will be made for multiplicity.This analysis will estimate the treatment effect related to 
Estimand 1.
Secondary: Absolute CFB in waist circumference at End of TreatmentAbsolute CFB in waist circumference at each planned in-clinic study visit up through the End of Visit Treatment visit will be analyzed using an MMRM model (as per Section 9.4.1.1). Baseline 
waist circumference will be included as a covariate in the model. No adjustments will be made for multiplicity. Results at the End of Treatment timepoint will be extracted from the model. 
This analysis will be applied to Estimand Set 1 to estimate the 
treatment effect related to Estimand 3.

9.4.4. Tertiary/Exploratory Endpoint(s)
For the purposes of reporting the shift in glycemic categories,34the following definitions will 
be used:
•Normoglycemia: FPG <100 mg/dL and HbA1c <5.7%;
•Pre-diabetes: FPG 100-125 mg/dL (both inclusive) or HbA1c 5.7-6.4% (both 
inclusive);
•T2DM: FPG ≥126 mg/dL or HbA1c ≥6.5%.
For discordant results between FPG and HbA1c with respect to the glycemic category criteria, the higher category will be used (eg, a participant with FPG of 124 mg/dL and HbA1c of 6.6% would be classified as T2DM).  
Further details on the definitions and analyses of this and other Tertiary/Exploratory 
endpoints will be described in the SAP.

Tertiary/Exploratory analyses not included in the efficacy or safety analyses outlined above 
will be documented in the SAP and may not be reported in the CSR. 
Pharmacogenomic or biomarker data from Banked Biospecimens may be collected during or 
after the trial and retained for future analyses; the results of such analyses are not planned to be included in the CSR.
9.5. Interim Analyses
An interim analysis will be performed at least once annually while the study is ongoing, after 
at least 25% of participants (ie, approximately 105) are randomized, with further details provided in the IRC charter.  This interim analysis will assess, at a minimum, unblindedsafety of the randomized participants. Additional interim analyses for safety and/or efficacy may be performed if needed. Further details will be provided in the IRC charter.  
Interim analysis results may be used for internal business decisions including, but not limited 
to: stopping a dose level, future study planning, stopping for futility, stopping for early success, conducting a sample size re-estimation, or adapting the study after the interim analysis.  Before any interim analysis is instigated, the details of the objectives, decision criteria, information dissemination plan, and method of maintaining the study blind as per Pfizer’s SOPs will be documented and approved in an IRC charter.  In addition, the analysis details must be documented and approved in an interim analysis SAP or final SAP.

section that addresses the use of samples for optional additional research. The optional additional research does not require the collection of any further samples.  The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each participant the objectives of the additionalresearch. Participants will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their consent at any time and for any reason during the storage period. A separate signature will be required to document a participant's agreement to allow specimens to be used for additional research. Participants who decline to participate in this optional additional research will not provide this separate signature.
10.1.4. Data Protection
All parties will comply with all applicable laws, including laws regarding the implementation 
of organizational and technical measures to ensure protection of participant data.
Participants’ personal data will be stored at the study site in encrypted electronic and/or paper 
form and will be password protected or secured in a locked room to ensure that only authorized study staff have access.  The study site will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data can be recovered in the event of disaster.  In the event of a potential personal data breach, the study site will be responsible for determining whether a personal data breach has in fact occurred and, if so, providing breach notifications as required by law.
To protect the rights and freedoms of participants with regard to the processing of personal 
data, participants will be assigned a single, participant-specific numerical code. Any participant records or data sets that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the numerical code; participant names will not be transferred. All other identifiable data transferred to the sponsor will be identified by this single, participant-specific code. The study site will maintain a confidential list of participants who participated in the study, linking each participant’s numerical code to his or her actual identity and medical record identification. In case of data transfer, the sponsor will protect the confidentiality of participants’ personal data consistent with the clinical study agreement and applicable privacy laws.
10.1.5. Dissemination of Clinical Study Data
Pfizer fulfills its commitment to publicly disclose clinical study results through posting the 
results of studies on www.clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov), the EudraCT, and/or 
www.pfizer.com, and other public registries in accordance with applicable local laws/regulations.  In addition, Pfizer reports study results outside of the requirements of local laws/regulations pursuant to its SOPs.

Page 9610.1.6. Data Quality Assurance
All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic CRF unless 
transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory data). The investigator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by physically or 
electronically signing the CRF.
The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the 
information entered in the CRF.
The investigator must ensure that the CRFs are securely stored at the study site in encrypted 
electronic and/or paper form and are password protected or secured in a locked room to prevent access by unauthorized third parties.
The investigator must permit study-related monitoring, audits, IRB/EC review, and 
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents.  This verification may also occur after study completion.  It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.
Monitoring details describing strategy (eg, risk-based initiatives in operations and quality 
such as risk management and mitigation strategies and analytical risk-based monitoring), methods, responsibilities, and requirements, including handling of noncompliance issues and monitoring techniques (central, remote, or on-site monitoring), are provided in the monitoring plan.
The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study, including 
quality checking of the data.
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered 
into the CRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.
Records and documents, including signed ICDs, pertaining to the conduct of this study must 
be retained by the investigator for 15 years after study completion unless local regulations or institutional policies require a longer retention period. No records may be destroyed during 
the retention period without the written approval of the sponsor. No records may be 
transferred to another location or party without written notification to the sponsor. The investigator must ensure that the records continue  to be stored securely for as long as they are 
maintained.
When participant data are to be deleted, the investigator will ensure that all copies of such 
data are promptly and irrevocably deleted from all systems.))

inspection notification in relation to the study.  Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with the sponsor or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow the sponsor or its agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection.  The investigator site and investigator will promptly resolve any discrepancies that are identified between the study data and the participant's medical records.  The investigator will promptly provide copies of the inspection findings to the sponsor or its agent.  Before response submission to the regulatory authorities, the investigator will provide the sponsor or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such findings.
10.1.7. Source Documents
Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate the 
integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator site.
Data reported on the CRF or entered in the eCRF that are from source documents must be 
consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study. Also, current medical records must be available.
Definition of what constitutes source data can be found in the study monitoring plan.Description of the use of computerized system is documented in the Data Management Plan.10.1.8. Study and Site Start and Closure
The study start date is the date on which the clinical study will be open for recruitment of 
participants.
The first act of recruitment is the date of the first participant’s first visit and will be the study 
start date.
The sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any 
time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study-site closure visit has been performed.
The investigator may initiate study-site closure at any time upon notification to the sponsor 
or designee/CRO if requested to do so by the responsible IRB/EC or if such termination is required to protect the health of study participants.
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor may include but are not limited 
to:
•Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/EC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines;

•Discontinuation of further study intervention development.
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor shall promptly inform the 
investigators, the ECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any CRO(s) used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator shall promptly inform the participant and should assure appropriate participant therapy and/or follow-up.
Study termination is also provided for in the clinical study agreement.  If there is any conflict 
between the contract and this protocol, the contract will control as to termination rights.
10.1.9. Publication Policy
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings by the 
investigator after publication of the overall study results or 1 year after the end of the study (or study termination), whichever comes first. 
The investigator agrees to refer to the primary publication in any subsequent publications 
such as secondary manuscripts, and submits all manuscripts or abstracts to the sponsor 30 days before submission. This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments and the investigator will, on request, remove any previously undisclosed confidential information before disclosure, except for any study- or Pfizer intervention-related information necessary for the appropriate scientific presentation or understanding of the study results.
For all publications relating to the study, the investigator will comply with recognized ethical 
standards concerning publications and authorship, including those established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.
The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of the overall study results 
covering all investigator sites.  In accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will support publication of multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data.  In this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement.
Authorship of publications for the overall study results will be determined by mutual 
agreement and in line with International Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements. 
If publication is addressed in the clinical study agreement, the publication policy set out in 
this section will not apply.

Page 9910.1.10. Sponsor’s Qualified Medical Personnel
The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the 
study is documented in the study contact list located in the SToD system.  
To facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study-related medical 
questions or problems, participants are provided with a contact card at the time of informed consent.  The contact card contains, at a minimum, protocol and study interventionidentifiers, participant numbers, contact information for the investigator site, and contact details for a contact center in the event that the investigator site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the participant’s participation in the study.  The contact number can also be used by investigator staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used only in the event that the established communication pathways between the investigator site and the study team are not available.  It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the established communication pathways between the investigator site and the study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study.  The contact number is not intended for use by the participant directly, and if a participant calls that number, he or she will be directed back to the investigator site.

should be considered serious.
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a preexisting condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.
d. Results in persistent disability/incapacity
•The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.
•This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f. Is a suspected transmission via a Pfizer product of an infectious agent, pathogenic 
or non-pathogenic, is considered serious.
The event may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings indicating 
an infection in a participant exposed to a Pfizer product. The terms “suspected transmission” and “transmission” are considered synonymous. These cases are considered unexpected and handled as serious expedited cases by pharmacovigilance personnel. Such cases are also considered for reporting as product defects, if appropriate.
g. Other situations:
•Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious.
•Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

safety margin is  between the estimated maternal exposure due to seminal transfer and the NOAEL for serious manifestations of developmental toxicity in nonclinical studies.
10.4.2. Female Participant Reproductive Inclusion Criteria
A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and at 
least 1 of the following conditions applies:
•Is not a WOCBP (see definitions below in Section 10.4.3).
OR
•Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure
rate of <1% per year), preferably with low user dependency, as described belowduring the intervention period and for at least 28 days after the last dose of study intervention, which corresponds to the time needed to eliminate any reproductive safety risk of the study intervention(s). The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study intervention.
•Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure rate of <1% per year), with high user dependency, as described below during the intervention period and for at least 28 days after the last dose of study intervention,which corresponds to the time needed to eliminate any reproductive safety risk of the study intervention(s) .  In addition, a second effective method of contraception, as 
described below, must be used.  The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study intervention.
The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy. 
10.4.3. Woman of Childbearing Potential
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal 
unless permanently sterile (see below).
If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot 
be confirmed before the first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered.CCI

1. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
•Documented hysterectomy;
•Documented bilateral salpingectomy;
•Documented bilateral oophorectomy.
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above, (eg, mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be applied to determining study entry.
Note: Documentation for any of the above categories can come from the site personnel’s 
review of the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  The method of documentation should be recorded in the participant’s medical record for the study.
2. Postmenopausal female:
•A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause. In addition, a
•High FSH level in the postmenopausal range must be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women under 60 years of age and not using hormonal 
contraception or HRT. 
•Female on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the nonestrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.
10.4.4. Contraception Methods
Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local availability/regulations 
regarding the use of contraceptive methods for those participating in clinical trials.
Highly Effective Methods That Have Low User Dependency
1. Implantable progestogen-only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation.

5. Vasectomized partner.
•Vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the 
partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed.  If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.  The spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days.
Highly Effective Methods That Are User Dependent
1. Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation:
•Oral;
•Intravaginal;
•Transdermal.
2. Progestogen-only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:
•Oral;
•Injectable.
3. Sexual abstinence:
•Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
One of the following effective barrier methods must be used in addition to the highly effective methods listed above that are user dependent:
•Male or female condom with or without spermicide;
•Cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide;
•A combination of male condom with either cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (double-barrier methods).

Use/Analysis of DNA
•Genetic variation may impact a participant’s response to study intervention, 
susceptibility to, and severity and progression of disease. Therefore, where local 
regulations and IRBs/ECs allow, a blood sample will be collected for DNA analysis.
•The scope of the genetic research may be narrow (eg, 1 or more candidate genes) or broad (eg, the entire genome), as appropriate to the scientific question under investigation.
•The samples may be analyzed as part of a multistudy assessment of genetic factors involved in the response to study intervention or study interventions of this class to understand treatments for the disease(s) under study or the disease(s) themselves.
•The results of genetic analyses may be reported in CSR or in a separate study summary, or may be used for internal decision making without being included in a study report.
•The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate 
measures to protect confidentiality. 
•The samples will be retained as indicated:
•Samples for banking will be stored indefinitely or for another period as per local 
requirements.
•Participants may withdraw their consent for the storage and/or use of their Banked Biospecimens at any time by making a request to the investigator; in this case, any remaining material will be destroyed.  Data already generated from the samples will be retained to protect the integrity of existing analyses.
•Banked Biospecimens will be labeled with a code.  The key between the code and the participant’s personally identifying information (eg, name, address) will be held at the study site and will not be provided to the sample bank.

Page 11410.6. Appendix 6: Liver Safety: Suggested Actions and Follow-up Assessments 
Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determined by elevations in 
transaminases) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury, but adapt are termed “adaptors.”  In some participants, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome.  These participants fail to adapt and therefore are "susceptible" to progressive and serious liver injury, commonly referred to as DILI.  Participants who experience a transaminase elevation above 3
×ULN should be monitored 
more frequently to determine if they are an “adaptor” or are “susceptible.”
In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in AST and/or ALT precede TBili elevations 
(>2×ULN) by several days or weeks.  The increase in TBili typically occurs while 
AST/ALT is/are still elevated above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/ALT and TBili values will be 
elevated within the same laboratory sample).  In rare instances, by the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have decreased.  This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal elevations in either AST OR ALT in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy’s law criteria) cases and should always be considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury have been excluded.
The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the 
participant’s individual baseline values and underlying conditions.  Participants who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values:
•Participants with AST/ALT and TBili baseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST OR ALT values >3 
×ULN AND a TBili value 
>2 × ULN with no evidence of hemolysis and an alkaline phosphatase value <2
×ULN or not available.
•For participants with baseline AST OR ALT OR TBili values above the ULN, the 
following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:
•Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 
×ULN; or >8 ×ULN (whichever is 
smaller).
•Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from baseline value by an amount of at least 1 × ULN orif the value reaches 
>3 × ULN (whichever is smaller).

Page 115Rises in AST/ALT and TBili separated by more than a few weeks should be assessed 
individually based on clinical judgment; any case where uncertainty remains as to whether it represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor.  
The participant should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history, and physical assessment.  
In addition to repeating measurements of AST and ALT and TBili for suspected cases of 
Hy’s law, additional laboratory tests should include albumin, CK, direct and indirect bilirubin, GGT, PT/INR, total bile acids, and alkaline phosphatase.  Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology.  A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen/paracetamol (either by itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over-the-counter medications), recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family history, sexual history, travel history, history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) and collection of serum samples for acetaminophen/paracetamol drug and/or protein adduct levels may be warranted. 
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria of AST/ALT and 
TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases if no other reason for the LFT abnormalities has yet been found.  Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) 
cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy’s law) case becomes a confirmed case only after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology.

Page 12210.9. Appendix 9: Proposed Chronology of Procedures
For the procedures described below, where multiple procedures are scheduled at the same 
timepoint(s) relative to dosing, the following chronology of events should be adhered to:
•Site-based PRO assessments: should be completed by the participant at the beginning of the visit before any medical procedures or interactions with the medical staff (as much as practically possible) take place (see Section 8.1.3 );
•12-lead ECG: obtain prior to vital signs assessment, blood samples, and prior to dosing (as applicable) (see Section 8.2.3); 
•Vital Signs (BP, pulse rate): obtain after 12-lead ECG collection but prior to obtaining blood samples and prior to dosing (as applicable for pre-dose collection) (see Section 8.2.2); 
•Measurement of body weight, waist and hip circumference:  obtain prior to dosing and food consumption (see Section 8.1.1 and Section 8.1.2 );
•Fasting blood samples [for safety (see Section 8.2.4 ), PK (see Section 8.5 ), and 
banked biospecimens (see Section 8.7.2 and Section 8.8.4 )]: after assessment of 
12-lead ECG and vital signs but prior to dosing (as applicable for pre-dose collection); 
•Dosing: must occur in the morning with food, and where applicable, after any pre-dose blood sample collection(s); 
•For the random, post-dose PK blood collection to occur approximately 2 to 6 hours post dose (see Section 8.5 ): these blood samples should be collected after vital signs 
are measured; if collection time coincides with time of a meal/snack, these blood samples should be collected just prior to the meal/snack.

Protocol Amendment Summary of Changes Table
Document History
Document Version Date Summary and Rationale for Changes
Amendment 1 16 December 2021 Rationale: The protocol was amended to 
add Cohort 2 where approximately 
49 additional participants will be randomized in a 1:2:2:2 ratio to the placebo (Arm 1, Figure 2) and 3 slow titration arms (Arms 7, 8, 9, Figure 2).  This cohort was added to better characterize the tolerability and efficacy profile of the 2-week titration schemes, relative to the 1-week titration schemes, and to maintain the double-blind study design.  All SoA activities will be the same for Cohort 2 as for the original Cohort of randomized participants.  The following sections were revised as part of this rationale: 
Section 1.1 Synopsis, Overall Design: 
Added wording to reflect the addition of Cohort 2, including that the additional participants will be randomized to blinded study intervention in 1 of 4 arms in a 1:2:2:2 ratio (placebo: 3 slow titration arms). 
Section 1.1 Synopsis, Number of 
Participants: Added the number of participants in Cohort 2, specifying that approximately 49 additional participants will be randomized to the placebo and slow titration arms (approximately 7 in the placebo and approximately 14 in each of the 3 slow titration arms).

Page 124Section 1.2 Schema, Figure 2 Titration 
Schema: Revised the “n” in the figure for the placebo and 3 slow titration arms to reflect the total number of participants in those arms, including the original Cohort plus Cohort 2.  Added a footnote to explain this.
Section 4.1 Overall Design: Revised the 
wording to reflect the addition of Cohort 2, including the subsequent enrollment into 4 of the 9 study arms (placebo and the 3 slow titration arms), and the number of participants being added as approximately 49.
Section 6.3.1 Allocation to Study 
Intervention: Added wording to reflect the randomization for Cohort 2 is 1:2:2:2 (placebo: 3 slow titration arms).
Section 9 Statistical Considerations: Added 
wording to reflect that the data from both cohorts (the original Cohort and Cohort 2) will be combined for final reporting.
Section 9.2 Sample Size Determination: 
provided updated sample size for Cohort 2 including rationale.
Section 9.4.1 General Considerations: 
Added wording to reflect that the data from both cohorts (the original Cohort and Cohort 2) will be combined for final reporting.
Rationale: updated the nonclinical safety 
section with the most recent toxicology information, available after the original protocol.
Section 2.2.1.2 Nonclinical Safety: Added 
that data from the 9-month toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys (Study 
) demonstrated no test

continuous ECG monitoring for the referenced scenario may be either cardiac telemetry or frequent ECG ascertainment as per investigator’s medical judgment for sites that do not have access to cardiac telemetry. 
Section 8.2.3 Electrocardiograms: added 
wording after continuous ECG monitoring to reflect this could be cardiac telemetry or frequent ECG ascertainment as per investigator’s medical judgment.
Rationale: incorporated Protocol 
Administrative Clarification Letter (dated 23 November 2020) change to clarify more precisely the timing following screening that blinding of the specified laboratory results will begin after randomization.
Section 10.2, Appendix 2: Clinical 
Laboratory Tests: changed wording for blinding of the specified labs to be “after randomization” rather than “following screening”.
Rationale: incorporated Protocol 
Administrative Clarification Letter #2 (dated 21 January 2021) change to clarify that the unblinding criteria for FPG include parameters for hyperglycemia as well as hypoglycemia, and to specify the level of FPG required for unblinding. 
Section 10.2, Appendix 2: Clinical 
Laboratory Tests; added wording for unblinding for FPG that indicates hyperglycemia with an FPG ≥270 mg/dL 
(15.0 mmol/L).
Rationale: incorporated changes from 
Protocol Administrative Clarification Letter #2 (dated 21 January 2021) and #3 (dated 01 Feb 2021) to clarify that the standard 30 day washout for investigational drug use

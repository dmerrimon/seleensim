CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 4 OF 78 2. PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Title of Study:  A Phase 2B Open -Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, and 
Tolerability of Topical VDA -1102 Ointment in Subjects with Actinic Keratosis  
Study Center(s):  Approximately  8 sites in the US  
Study Duration: Approximately  12 months  Phases of Development: Phase 2 
Study Objectives  
Primary Objecti ves:  
• To assess the percent of subjects with complete clearance of the actinic keratosis 
(AK) lesions in their Treatment Field at Week 16   
• To assess the percent of subjects who have facial Treatment Fields who have 
complete clearance of actinic keratosis ( AK) lesions at Week 1 6 
• To evaluate the systemic and local (skin) safety and tolerability of topical application 
of VDA -1102 ointment in adult subjects with AK . 
Secondary Objectives:  
• To assess the p ercent of subjects with partial  (≥75%) clearance of the act inic keratosis 
(AK) lesions in their Treatment Field on Week 1 6  
• To assess the p ercent of subjects with facial Treatment Fields who have partial  
(≥75%) clearance of the actinic keratosis (AK) lesions  on Week 1 6  
• To assess the reduction in the number of the  actinic keratosis (AK) lesions in the 
Treatment Field on Week 16 
• To assess the reduction in the number of the actinic keratosis (AK) lesions on Week 
16 of subjects with facial Treatment Fields  
Study Design  
This Phase 2 clinical trial is a  3-part, open -label, multi -center study involving a non-
occluded, daily topical dermal application of 1 of 2 strengths of VDA -1102 ointment for 
approximately 12 weeks ( 84 days ) to an initial 2 cohorts of subjects . The first 40 eligible 
subjects will be enrolled into Cohor t 1 (Part A).  Cohort 1 subjects will be assigned to receive 
approximately 200 mg of 10% VDA -1102 twice -daily (BID). Once approximately 40 
subjects have been enrolled in Cohort 1, Cohort 1 will be closed to enrollment and C ohort 2 
(Part B) will be opened for enrollment.  Cohort 2 subjects will be assigned to receive 
approximately 200 mg of 20% VDA -1102 once -daily (QD). Once approximately 40 subjects 
have been enrolled in Cohort 2, an additional 70 subjects will be randomly assigned to 
Cohort 1  or Cohort 2  (Part C) in a 1:1 ratio.  
To qualify for the study, subjects aged 18 (inclusive) or older must have signed informed 
consent and met the study enrollment criteria that include having 4 -8 actinic keratosis (AK) 
lesion s within an approximate 25 cm2 area on the ch eek, forehead , or hairless scalp (the 
“Treatment Field”).  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 5 OF 78 Parts A, B, and C  of this clinical trial will each include the same 3 study periods , a Screening 
Period (Day -21 through Day 1 Pre-Dose), a  Treatment Period (Day 1 Dosing through Week 
12), and a  Post-Treatment  Follow -Up Period (Week 13 through Week 16) .   
During the Screening Visit  (up to 21 days pre -dose) subjects who have given written 
informed consent will undergo safety assessments, Treatment Field identification, and other 
qualifying procedures .  
At the Day 1 Pre -Dose Visit , eligible subjects will return to the in vestigative site for baseline 
assessments  as well as final eligibility screening .  Subjects who continue to meet the 
enrollment criteria will be enrolled and will continue to the Day 1  Dosing Visit.  The number 
of AK lesions within the Treatment Field will be recorded.  
During the Treatment Period, enrolled subjects (or their dosing partner) will apply the first 
dose of the study drug on Day 1 under the supervision of the site personnel t o assure proper 
application.  After release from the research clinic on Day 1 , subjects (or their dosing partner) 
will continue the prescribed VDA -1102 dosing regimen at home. Subjects will visit their 
respective investigative sites on Week 4 and Week 8 for safety and efficacy (AK lesion 
count) assessments, drug accountability, and re -training in proper application of the study 
drug. On the Week 12 Visit , subjects will return to the clinic for their final safety and 
efficacy assessments as well as final stud y drug accountability.  
During the Post -Treatment Follow -up Period, s ubjects will visit their respective 
investigative sites on Week 13  and Week 16  for safety and efficacy assessments. Subjects 
will exit the study following completion of their Week 16 asses sments . Subjects with 
continuing AEs will be scheduled for follow -up evaluation, as appropriate.  
Subjects will have Post-Treatment  Follow -Up visits to  their respective investigative sites on 
Week 1 3 and Week 16 for safety and efficacy assessments.  All AK  lesions within the 
Treatment Field will be counted.  At the Week 13 Visit site personnel will review with each 
subject the study instructions and the date of their next study visit.  
Subject Population:   
Men or women 18 years of age or older with a diagn osis of Actinic Keratosis with between 
4 and 8 Grade 1 or Grade 2 AK lesions within a single contiguous 25 cm2 area of skin on 
their face or balding scalp.  
Number of Enroll ed Subjects (planned):    
A maximum of approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled i n this 2 -cohort clinical trial. In 
each cohort, approximately 75 eligible subjects will be enrolled in order to complete each 
cohort  with safety and efficacy data from at least 70 subjects  who received study drug .  
Maximum Time Subjects  May Remain in the Study:  
Subjects may participate in this study for a maximum of  143 days (21 days Screening Period 
+ 89 days Treatment Period + 33 days Post-Treatment Follow -Up Period ). 
 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 6 OF 78 Study Endpoints:  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint s:    
• Percentage of subjects achieving com plete clearance of AK lesions within the ir 
Treatment Field  on Week 16  
• Percentage of subjects with facial Treatment Fields achieving complete clearance of  AK 
lesions  on Week 16  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  
• Percentage of subjects achieving partial (≥75%) clearance of AK lesions within their 
Treatment Field on Week 16   
• Percentage of subjects with facial Treatment Fields achieving partial (≥75%) clearance 
of AK lesions on Week 16   
• Change from baseline in the n umber of AK lesions in the Treatment Field of each subject  
by Weeks  16 
• Change from  baseline in the number of facial AK lesions in the Treatment Field of each 
subject by Weeks 16  
Safety Endpoints:   
• AEs, clinical laboratory parameters , vital signs, physical examinations, Local Skin 
Reaction (LSR) Scores, electrocardiograms, and drug exposure .  
Statistical Analyses:  
Sample Size  
The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of topical VDA -1102 
ointment in subjects with actinic kerat osis. Approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled in 
this 2 -cohort clinical trial. In each cohort, approximately 75 eligible subjects will be enrolled 
in order to complete each cohort with safety and efficacy data from at least 70 subjects who 
received stu dy drug. Considering the results from a previous Phase 2  parallel, randomized, 
placebo -controlled study with a sample size of 29 to 32 subjects per treatment group , this 
sample size is considered adequate to evaluate the stated objectives. A formal sample size 
calculation was not performed . 
Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy endpoints will be summarized by cohort and visit on the modified Intent -to-Treat 
(mITT) population and Per Protocol (PP) population,  as well as on pre-defined subgroup s of 
the modified Intent -to-Treat population and Per Protocol population  including  subjects 
whose Treatment Field was on their face (i.e., cheek or forehead, not scalp).  
Given that the study does not contain a control arm , formal statistical analyses of the efficacy 
data are not p lanned.  
 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 7 OF 78 Safety Analysis  
The safety endpoint data will be summarized for the Safety  Population.  A Es will be 
categorized by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Terms (PT) using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 19.1 or h igher.  The incidence of 
AEs, as well as the intensity and relationship to study drug, will be summarized by cohort .  
Safety will also be assessed by evaluating findings of vital signs, physical examinations, 
Local Skin Reaction Scores, clinical laboratory  test results, 12 -lead ECG tracings, drug 
exposure/compliance, concomitant medications, pregnancy testing, dose adjustments, and 
withdrawals  / terminations.  These findings will be summarized and compared to findings 
from Baseline (Day 1 Pre-Dose) evaluatio ns.

CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 16 OF 78 5. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
5.1. Indication  
VDA -1102 is a small molecule new chemical entity (NCE) under development for the 
treatment of patients with actinic keratosis  (AK) .  
5.2. Actinic Keratosis and Current Approaches to Treatment  
Actinic keratosis (AK) is one of the most common dermatologic diagnoses and affects an 
estimated 58 million people in the United States. Estimated treatment costs in 2004 were $1.2 
billion (Warino 2006). AK  is generally present as rough patches or papules with erythema and 
scaling on sun -exposed skin, predominantly in older individuals with fair skin (Fitzpatrick skin 
types I -III). The lesions are often asymptomatic, but they may itch or be tender to the touch. 
Histologic ally, AK is characterized by keratinocyte atypia in the deeper epidermis , with 
defective maturation of the superficial epidermis  (Cohen , 2010) . The most common reason for 
treatment is to prevent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Although the risk o f 
progression to invasive SCC for a specific lesion may be low, it is widely regarded that 60% 
to 97% of SCCs originate from A K’s (Hurwitz 1995,  Mittelbronn , 1998 ). This estimate is 
supported by considerable genetic analysis that demonstrates shared chromos omal 
abnormalities and progressive changes in gene expression between AK and SCC (Kanjilal , 
1995,  Ortonne , 2002,  Kanellou , 2008,  Padilla , 2010). Consequently , AK is often referred to as 
cSCC in situ  (Heaphy , 2000, Oppel , 2004,  Röwert -Huber , 2007) and is pa rt of the continuum 
of transformation from normal skin to AK and cSCC ( Ziegler , 1994 , Stockfleth , 2013) .  
Since AK results from malignant processes in sun -exposed skin (mainly face, scalp, and 
extremities), it is often necessary to treat entire fields and not on ly the individual lesions. 
Cryosurgery and laser -based therapies are less effective for this indication. Currently the most 
common topical drugs and treatments for field -treatments of  AK are 5-fluorourac il (5FU) , 
imiquimod cream, ingenol mebutate gel , photody namic therapy (PDT), and diclofenac sodium 
in hyaluronic acid  (Chetty , 2015) .  
5.3. Unmet Medical Need  
Current AK therapies are inadequate and pose significant challenges to public health. Nearly 
all field treatments  are associated with painful severe local skin reactions  ranging from necrosis 
to inflammation  which reduce treatment compliance  (Shergill 2014) . Cryotherapy and surgery 
are used to treat a limited number of lesions. However, these may leave unsightly scars or 
hypopigmentation  and patients o ften require repeat treatments.  
The limited tolerability of most current treatments greatly decreases the willingness of patients 
to be retreated. Diclofenac sodium is t he only drug available that is well tolerated . However, it 
requires daily application for prolonged periods , shares the contraindications and potential side 
effects of the non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drug, and its long-term efficacy is still unknown. 
Consequently, AK patients often elect to avoid treatment  and seek medical help only after their 
lesions have become esthetically intolerable or have ad vanced to invasive cSCC tumor s.  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 17 OF 78 In contrast, VDA -1102 has the potential for a significantly more desirable benefit -risk ratio . 
The drug induces neither necrosis nor an inflammatory reaction. VDA -1102 would mitigat e 
people ’s avoidance of treatment and the often -required re -treatment  of their chronic, recurrent 
skin disease .   
5.4. Nonclinical Summary  
The four GLP toxicology studies performed were the 28-day and 13-week repeated dose oral 
toxicity st udies  in male and female rats (with a recovery phase and toxico kinetics ), and the 28-
day and 3 -month topical dermal toxicity studies  in male and female minipigs (with a recovery 
phase and toxicokinetics ). 
5.4.1.  Oral toxicity studies in male and female rats  
• 28-day repeated dose with a recovery phase and toxicokinetics  
Oral administrations of 800 mg/kg/day of VDA -1102 once daily for 28 days to male and 
female SD rats was associated with clinical signs and intestinal -tract related inflammation 
in the non -glandular stomach (forestomach), cecum, and colon. These findings were either 
resolved or trending towards remission at the end of the 2 -week recovery phase. These 
gastrointestinal effects may be related to irritant properties associated with repeated oral 
gavage ad ministration of VDA -1102. The  No Observed Adverse Effect Level  (NOAEL ) 
was 300  mg/kg/day ( this approximately equates to a human equivalent dose (HED) of 48 
mg/kg/day). Systemic exposure to VDA -1102 was not detected , but substantial blood levels 
of its meta bolite jasmonic acid were found, suggestive of a rapid metabolism of VDA -1102 
by this route of administration.  
• 13-week repeated dose with a recovery phase and toxicokinetic s 
A 13-week  study was conducted to evaluate the potential toxicity of VDA -1102 after  daily 
oral administration of 75, 150, and 300  mg/kg/day (HED 12, 24, and 48 mg/kg/day , 
respectively) of VDA -1102 for 13 weeks to male and female SD rats with a 6 weeks 
recovery period and toxicokinetics. All the animals in this study have completed their 13-
week dosing period  and 6 -week recovery period. There were no deaths, no observed 
changes in food consumption, nor decrease in body weight in any of the rats. No treatment -
related changes were recorded in organ weights or macroscopic examinations in trea ted 
animals, when compared with controls. Laboratory investigation (i.e. hematology, 
coagulation, blood chemistry and urinalysis) failed to show toxicologically relevant 
modifications at any of the tested doses. The only clinical observation  was salivation  in 
most of the animals in the high -dose group and in some animals in the mid -dose group.  
Non-adverse histopathological changes were observed in the duodenum and spleen of 
male and female animals dosed at 300 mg/kg/day (high dose level).  These findings w ere 
not observed at the end of a 6 -week treatment -free recovery period. Therefore, the NOAEL 
(No Observed Adverse Effect Level) for this study was considered to be 300 mg/kg/day . 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 18 OF 78 5.4.2.  Topical dermal toxicity studies  in male and female minipigs  
• 28-day repeat dos e with a recovery phase and toxicokinetics  
In the 28 -day minipig study, there were no noteworthy systemic toxicity effects observed 
following once -daily dermal application of VDA -1102 ointment to 10% of their body 
surface area, even at the highest strength  tested of 20%, which is also the maximum feasible 
dose in this formulation. The NOAEL for systemic toxicity was thus 20% VDA -1102 
ointment, corresponding to a topical dose level of 60 mg/kg/day (HED 43 mg/kg/day). The 
NOAEL for local application site effe cts was 5% VDA -1102 ointment. The only notable 
findings were observed in animals treated with 10% and 20% VDA -1102 ointment, where 
very slight to slight erythema was reported, that progressed after approximately 2 weeks to 
mild/moderate erythema, edema, desquamation, and/or scabs. These findings appeared to 
be reversible  with cessation of the treatment. A maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) for the 
local application of VDA -1102 was not reached even at the highest dose tested of 20%.  
• 13-week repeat dose  with a reco very phase and toxicokinetics  
A 13-week study was conducted to evaluate the potential toxicity of VDA -1102  when 
administered on the skin  in male and female minipigs after daily unoccluded topical 
administration to 10% of the body surface area at concentrat ions 2.5, 5 and 15% of VDA -
1102 ointment (corresponding to 7.5, 15, and 45 mg/kg/day, HED 11, 21, and 32 
mg/kg/day, respectively). No treatment -related changes of significance were observed in 
mortality, clinical signs of systemic toxicity, body weight, fo od consumption, 
ophthalmoscopy, electrocardiography, clinical pathology investigations, organ weights , or 
macroscopic/microscopic examinations apart from changes at the dermal application site.  
Erythema (sometimes multifocal) at the treatment site of simil ar magnitude and severity 
were observed in both VDA -1102 -treated and vehicle control animals. Erythema was of 
similar magnitude and severity in all treatment groups with a mean severity score of “very 
slight” to “slight/well -defined .” In single cases and f or a limited period of time, “moderate” 
erythema was observed. On occasion c rust/scabs  accompanied the erythema, part icularly 
in animals receiving 15%VDA -1102. In addition, dose -related “v ery slight ” edema  was 
only occasionally observed in animals rece iving VDA -1102 .  
Skin reactions, in general, appeared within the first two weeks of the study, increased up to  
Week 4 and remained stable or showed a tendency to a slight improvement thereafter. 
During  recovery a clear trend to recovery was observed and a comp lete recovery was noted 
at Week 4 of the recovery period.  
The undetectable (or very low) concentration s of VDA -1102 measured on Day 1 and the 
low blood levels detected on Week 13  along with the low concentrations  of jasmonic acid 
detected on Day 1 and the large exposure to this metabolite measured on  Week 13, suggest 
that VDA -1102 is slowly absorbed from the skin of the minipigs and rapidly metabolized . 
The Week 13 jasmonic acid systemic exposure in minipigs following dermal application of 
5% VDA -1102 in th e present study was comparable to that obtained in minipigs receiving 
5% VDA -1102 for 4 weeks in a previous study (RTC Study A0608), suggesting that at this 
dose level, there is no accumulation with an increase in duration of topical application.  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 19 OF 78 The NOAEL  (No Observed Adverse Effect Level) for systemic toxicity was 15% VDA -
1102 , the highest concentration tested. The NOAEL  for the local  effects was  5% VDA -
1102  (15.2 mg/kg/day) . 
As discussed below in Section  5.7, the relative doses of VDA -1102 fed to rats and applied to 
the skin of minipigs were significantly higher tha n the exposures in the current planned clinical 
study.  
Full details of the non -clinical studies performed to date are found in the accompanying 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
5.5. VDA -1102 Clinical Summary  
Three clinical trial have been conducted with VDA -1102 topic al (dermal) ointment, a first-in-
human Phase 1 a single -dose study in older -adult healthy volunteers , a Phase 2a study in which 
93 subjects with act inic keratosis received a once -daily application of study drug (5% or 10% 
VDA -1102, or Placebo) for  4 weeks , and an ongoing  Phase 1b multiple -dose preliminary safety 
trial in AK subjects  to evaluate a more frequent  applications, higher strength of VDA -1102 , 
and longer treatment duration s (8-12 weeks) .  
5.5.1.  Phase 1 A Clinical Trial  (Completed)  
Study VDA -CP-01 was a single -center, randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled , 
single -dose,  dose-escalation study in 3 unique cohorts (4 active, 1 placebo randomized per 
cohort) of older healthy adult subjects . The objectives of the study were assessment  of the local 
and systemic safety of the study drug as well and the pharmacokinetics of VDA -1102 and its 
primary metabolite (jasmonic acid) after application of VDA -1102 (5, 10 or 20%) or placebo 
to a 25 cm2 area of the skin of each subject’s forehead for 24 hours.  
The conclusions of this study were as follows:  
• Topical application of VDA -1102 at concentrations of 5%, 10%, and 20% versus placebo 
were well -tolerated follo wing a single application of approximately 250 mg to a 25 cm2 
Treatment Field (forehead area) of healthy older -adult subjects.  
• Detailed and frequent examination of the Treatment Field for local skin reactions did not 
reveal any treatment -emergent findings at concentrations as high as 20% VDA -1102 . 
• There were no TEAEs related to study drug in any subject with the exception of mild left 
eye pain that occurred approximately 4 hours after the drug was applied to the forehead in 
1 subject receiving 10% VDA -1102 .  This event was short -lived and resolved without 
sequelae.  
• There were no treatment emergent changes in any subject in clinical laboratory, vital signs, 
physical examination, or ECG evaluations.  
• Undetectable plasma concentrations of VDA -1102 or its primary  metabolite (jasmonic 
acid) at any time point (using a sensitive LC -MS/MS validated assay) during or after a 24 -
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 20 OF 78 hour topical exposure to up to 20% VDA -1102 suggest minimal systemic absorption of 
VDA -1102 under the conditions of this study.  
5.5.2.  Phase 2 Clinical  Trial  (Completed)  
Study VDA -CP-03 was a  Phase 2, multi -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
multiple -dose, parallel -cohort study involving the once -daily non -occluded, topical dermal 
application of VDA -1102 ointment for 28  to subjects wit h AK. Eligible subjects were required 
to present with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 8 discrete Grade 1 -2 AK lesions within a 
single 25 cm2 area of skin on their scalp or face that met specific criteria for the AK Lesions 
and Treatment Field .  Ninety -three (93) eligible subjects in Israel and the United States were 
randomly assigned in a double -blind fashion to 1 of 3 parallel treatment groups  (5%, or 10% 
VDA -1102, or placebo) in a ratio of 1:1:1. Randomized subjects applied approximately 200 
mg of study d rug each evening to a 25 cm2 Treatment Field on their face or scalp. Subjects 
underwent safety and efficacy assessments during the Treatment Period on Days 7, 14, and 28 
and during the Observation Period on Days 35 and 56 (and Day 84 for subjects who conse nted 
to Amendment 2). A sub -group of 12 subjects, who met additional more stringent enrollment 
criteria, participated in the PK Study Sub -Cohort.  
The overall conclusions from this proof -of-concept study that included a relatively short 28 -
days of double -blind, placebo -controlled treatment with study drug are as follows:  
• VDA -1102 at dosage strengths of 5% or 10% given as 200 mg topical doses daily for 28 
days was well -tolerated both from a systemic as well as a local skin area (site of application) 
perspect ive.  This is consistent with the good dosing compliance and low level of early 
discontinuations without the need to adjust the dosing regimen for any subject.  
• There were no deaths, serious adverse events related to study drug, or early study 
discontinuati ons for A Es related to study drug in this study.   
• In the AK patient population evaluated in this study, 28 days of once daily dosing of a 
predefined Treatment Field on the face or scalp with 200 mg of either VDA -1102 5% or 
10% did not result in a statisti cally significant decrease in the number of AK lesions 
compared to placebo treatment.  However, the mean decrease was greater in the VDA -1102 
10% treatment group compared to the placebo treatment group.  
• The differences between the VDA -1102 10% treatment g roup and the placebo treatment 
group on the 4 exploratory efficacy endpoints consistently favored VDA -1102 10% across 
all 3 analysis populations.  These differences (ITT population) were statistically 
significantly different (versus placebo) for change fro m baseline in the number of lesions 
with a grade ≥ 2 (P = 0.03) and change from baseline in the adjusted number of lesions 
weighted by grade (P = 0.02).  
• There were no statistically or clinically relevant differences on any exploratory endpoint 
between the VDA -1102 5% and placebo treatment groups.  
• Post-hoc analysis of an efficacy subset of patients who were only treated for AK Treatment 
Field lesions on the face (ie, not scalp) and represented approximately 75% of enrolled 
patients demonstrated that the VDA -1102 10% treatment group (ITT population) had a 
statistically significant greater reduction in the number of AK lesions compared to the 
placebo treatment group (P = 0.02).  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 21 OF 78 • The positive finding for VDA -1102 10% treatment group in the efficacy subset of pati ents 
with AK Treatment Fields only on the face was supported by similar treatment effect 
differences versus the placebo treatment group on the exploratory endpoints evaluated in 
the originally planned exploratory analyses.  
• A post -hoc analysis of treatment group differences (ITT population) for progression of AK 
to Grade 3 indicated 2 subjects in the placebo treatment group progressed to grade 3 versus 
no subjects in the 2 VDA -1102 treatment groups.  
• The inability to detect plasma concentrations of VDA -1102 o r jasmonic acid using sensitive 
methodology in the subjects included in the PK sub -cohort suggests no systemic absorption 
of 200 mg VDA -1102 when applied once -daily topically for up to 28 days in a 25 cm2 
Treatment Field.  
Further details of the results of this trial are provided in the VDA -1102 Investigator’s brochure.  
5.5.3.  Phase 1B Clinical Trial (Ongoing)  
Study VDA -CP-04 is an ongoing  single -center, open -label, 2 -cohort , dose-escalation study  in 
patients with AK. Cohort 1 of the study is complete ; Cohort 2 is ongoing. In the completed 
Cohort 1,  five subjects applied  200 mg of  10% VDA -1102 twice -daily for 8 weeks  to a 25 cm2 
Treatment Field located on their face, forehead, or balding scalp . Subjects underwent safety 
and efficacy assessments at Baseline and at We ek 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 12 Visits. The following is 
a summary of the available safety data from the completed Cohort 1 of this study : 
• There have been no systemic safety signals as demonstrated by a lack of clinically 
significant changes in v ital signs, physical examinatio ns, clinical laboratory results, and 
electrocardiographic data.  
• There were no deaths or SAEs  and n o subject withdrew consent from the trial prematurely , 
although 1 subject described below prematurely stopped the study drug due to an AE.  
• The mean maximum Local Skin Reaction (LSR) composite score was 1.2 (0=no reaction; 
1=trace; 2=mild; 3=moderate; 4=severe).  
• Three of the 5 subjects reported treatment -related A Es. For 2 of these subjects the AEs 
were mild in severity (conjunctivitis right eye and itchy and  painful scalp).  For 1 subject 
the AE of contact dermatitis was considered severe.  For this latter subject, the Treatment 
Field was on their right forehead . The subject  received topical 5 -FU and photodynamic 
therapy (major deviations) to numerous A Ks loc ated over a large area of her upper chest 
during Week 3 and developed a severe facial dermatitis at Week 4 that involved the right 
forehead, ipsilateral periorbital area, and bilateral cheeks. Throughout , the individual LSR 
scores remained mild to moderate . The eruption completely resolved with cessation of the 
study drug 2 days after the Week 4 Visit (2 weeks) and application of a topical steroid 
cream (1 week).  
• Neither the parent molecule VDA -1102 nor its primary metabolite  jasmonic acid  was 
detected in t imed blood samples  assayed with a  validated and sensitive bioanalytical 
method.  
In Cohort 2, six subjects will apply 200 mg of 20% VDA -1102 to their Treatment Field for 12 
weeks. This cohort is currently enrolling.  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 22 OF 78 5.6. Rationale for Study Design and Subject P opulation  
5.6.1.  Efficacy  
VDA -1102 has shown relevant pharmacological effects  in vivo  in the UVB -induced SKH -1 
hairless mice  model of actinic keratosis and skin cancer . In this pre-clinical study, dermal 
application of VDA -1102 led to a significant (p < 0.0001) r eduction in the number of lesions 
relative to vehicle , that was comparable to the reduction noted with the comparative control 
compound ingenol mebutate (Picato®) 0.05%. C linical effects were  observed within 1–2 
week s of treatment initiation , although full  clinical benefit was observed after 3 -4 weeks .  
In the Phase 2 a study (Section 5.5.2 , above) subjects treated once -daily with 10% VDA -1102 
or placebo for 4 weeks ( 28 days ) had a modest reduction from baseline in the total number of 
AK lesions ( 32.1% versus 27.8%, respectively). The decrement in the number of lesions of 
subjects in the per protocol  population who had Treatment Fields located on their face (not 
scalp) was more impressive and statistically signifi cantly (median 50%; mean 41.3% ±38.5% 
for the VDA -1102 10% treatment group versus median 10%; mean 29.4% ±32.5%, for the 
placebo treatment group , P = 0.022 adjusted for age, gender and site).   
In the small (N=5)  completed Cohort 1 of the  Phase 1B trial su mmarized in Section 5.5.3 , 
subjects treated with 10% VDA -1102 twice -daily for 8 weeks  had a 74% reduction in the 
number of AK lesions in their Treatment Field. Aside from 2 subjects with reversible skin 
reactio ns, the drug was well -tolerated and safe. Together, these data suggest VDA -1102 has 
therapeutic effects and further evaluation of the dosing regimen/dose and longer duration of 
treatment is warranted.  
In contrast to the  aforementioned Phase 2a study  where  200 mg of 10% VDA -1102 ointment 
was applied once -daily  for 4 weeks  and the completed Cohort 1 of the  small ongoing Phase 1b 
study where 200 mg of 10% VDA -1102 ointment was applied twice -daily for  8 weeks , the 
dosing frequency in Part A (Cohort 1) of the current clinical trial remains  200 mg of 10% VDA -
1102 ointment twice -daily ; however, the treatment duration will be extended to  12 weeks.   
In Part B (Cohort 2) of the current trial, the strength of the VDA -1102 ointment increases from 
10% to 20%  but the dosin g frequency d rops from twice -daily to once -daily . The treatment 
duration will be the same as in Part A, 12 weeks .  
Subjects enrolled in Part C of the current trial will be randomized to receive approximately 200 
mg of either 10% VDA -1102 BID as was given t o Cohort 1 in Part A or 20% VDA -1102 QD 
as was applied by Cohort 2 in Part B.   
5.6.2.  Safety  
The results from the toxicology studies and the estimated safety margins indicate that daily 
dermal application of 200 mg  of VDA -1102 ointment for 12 weeks  at doses as h igh as 20% to 
an area of 25 cm2 does not pose an untoward risk for evaluation in the target patient population. 
Specifically, topical application once -daily for 13-weeks  of approximately  5 grams  of 2.5%, 
5%, 15% VDA -1102 ointment to 10% of the minipigs bod y surface area in the nonclinical 
toxicology program resulted in no systemic safety findings . Only mild to moderate  skin 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 23 OF 78 findings  (almost exclusively erythema ; no ulceration, v esiculation  or pustulation ) were seen in 
the VDA -1102 treated groups as well as in the control groups. Transient m ild edema and 
isolated scabs/crust were reported in a minority of 15% VDA -1102 -treated animals. All lesions 
were self -limited and reversible.  
In the completed Study VDA -CP-01 in healthy subjects  (Section 5.5), no safety concerns were 
identified following a single -dose of approximately 250  mg of 5%, 10%, or 20% VDA -1102  
applied once to a 25 cm2 area on the forehead of healthy older -adult volunteers.  PK analysis 
demonstrated tha t there were no detectable concentration s of VDA -1102 or its primary 
metabolite jasmonic acid.  
In the completed Study VDA -CP-03 in AK patients  (Section 5.6.1 ), 200 mg of 5% o r 10% 
VDA -1102 ointment was applied  once -daily for 4 weeks  to an area of 25 cm2 on the cheek, 
forehead, or scalp. No safety concerns were identified. VDA -1102 5% and 10% were well-
tolerated when applied once -daily for 4 weeks . There was no clinically significant change in 
the Local Skin Rea ction individual component scores or total scores. PK analyses of plasma 
from timed pre - and post -dose blood samples  demonstrated that there were no detectable 
concentrations of VDA -1102 or its primary metabolite jasmonic acid.  
In the competed Cohort 1 of  the ongoing S tudy VDA -CP-04 (Section 5.5.3 ) in AK patients, 
subjects applied 200 mg of 10% VDA -1102 twice -daily to their facial or scalp Treatment Field  
for 8-weeks . No significant systemic safety findings wer e reported . Two  subjects  experienced 
reversible skin eruptions attributed to the study drug : one of whom underwent extensive 
prohibited treatments (topical 5FU and photodynamic therapy) to AK lesions on her upper 
chest during the Treatment Period coinciden t with the initiation of the facial eruption and a 
second subject who experienced a mild, self -limited scalp eruption . PK analyses of plasma 
from timed pre - and post -dose blood samples demonstrated that there were no detectable 
concentrations of VDA -1102 o r its primary metabolite jasmonic acid  in the plasma samples .  
In the current study, 10% VDA -1102 will be applied twice -daily for 12 weeks  in Cohort 1 and  
20% VDA -1102 will be applied once -daily for 12 weeks  in Cohort 2 . Given the lack of 
systemic absorpti on in subjects treated with 10% VDA -1102 BID for 8 weeks in Study VDA -
CP-04 (Section 5.5.3 ), we believe that any potential safety concerns in either of these 2 cohorts 
would not be systemic and will be limited to the Treatment Field and perhaps the surrounding 
skin. To date, all adverse reactions in and around the Treatment Field have be en reversible and 
the great majority were mild, short -lived, and self -limited.   
5.6.3.  Pharmacokinetics  
In preclinical PK studies, VDA -1102 was rapidly metabolized , form ing jasmonic acid (JA) as 
its inactive primary metabolite, regardless of the animal species o r the route of administration. 
In all cases, the amount of JA in the blood equaled or exceeded the concentrations of VDA -
1102 in the blood.  In a 28 -day dermal toxicity study in male and female minipigs, 5%, 10% or 
20% of VDA -1102 ointment was applied once  daily to 10% of the body surface area. Blood 
levels of VDA -1102 were essentially below the LLOQ on Day 1 and very low and highly 
variable on Day 28. Blood concentrations of the primary metabolite jasmonic acid on Day 1 
were detected only in the 20% VDA -1102 ointment group On Day 28, blood levels of jasmonic 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 24 OF 78 acid were detected at all dose levels and were higher than that on Day 1, likely related to slow 
transdermal absorption as it appeared that steady state levels were present on Day 28.  
In the 13 -week topical dermal toxicity study performed in minipigs,  low levels of both VDA -
1102 and the major metabolite JA were detected on Day 1. However, by Week 13 high 
concentrations of JA ( Cmax= 954 and 1830 ng/mL for male and female minipigs, respectively ) 
were foun d in plasma while VDA -1102 concentrations remained low which suggest ed a slow 
absorption of VDA -1102 and  rapid metabolism of the parent drug to JA.  
In the completed Phase 1a , 1b, and 2a clinical trial s, plasma levels  of VDA -1102 and its 
primary metabolite jasmonic acid  (JA) were below the lowest level of detection at all 
timepoints sampled . 
5.6.4.  Study Design Rationale  
The results from the Phase 2a (VDA -CP-03; Section 5.5.2 ) clinical trial support the safety and 
tolerability of 200 mg of 10% VDA -1102 ointment when applied once -daily for 4 weeks  (28 
days), but the e fficacy was moderate . In the completed Cohort 1 of the ongoing Phase 1B trial 
(VDA -CP-04; Section 5.5.3 ) subjec ts treated with 10% VDA -1102 twice -daily for 8 weeks the 
efficacy was improved, while safety and tolerability were maintained. These studies suggest 
that higher study drug concentration s, more frequent dosing , and/or a longer treatment duration  
are likely to improve efficacy. The non -clinical and clinical data support the safety of this 
approach as well . 
In Cohort 1 (Part A ) of the current study 40 subjects will apply approximately 200 mg of 10% 
VDA -1102 twice -daily, the same dose applied in Cohort 1 of trial VDA -CP-04. However, 
subjects enrolled in the current study ( VDA -CP-05) will apply the study drug to their Treatment 
Field for 12 weeks instead of 8  weeks.   
Once approximately 40  subjects have been enrolled in Cohort 1  (Part A), this cohort will be 
closed to enrollment and  Cohort 2 (Part B) will be opened  for enrollment .  
The reason for the initial split into Part A and Part B is due to the drug product manufacture r’s 
schedule (i.e., drug supply).  
In Cohort 2 (Part B ) approximately 40 subjects will apply approximately 200 mg of 20% 
VDA -1102 once -daily to their Treatment Field for 12 weeks.   
Following completion of enrollment of approximately 40 subjects into Cohort 2 (Part B), Part 
C will be opened to enrollment  wherein 70 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either 
Cohort 1 or Cohort 2 . Thus, the  trial will close with a total of approximately 75 subjects in each 
cohort .  
The goals and rationale of this open -label, dose-escalation trial are to assess the tolerance , 
safety, and efficacy of two diffe rent dosing strategies for  VDA -1102 ointment . The results of 
this study will be applied to the study design and dose selection for the pivotal  Phase 3 trials.  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 25 OF 78 5.7. Dose and Posology Justification  
Vidac is assessing the dose -response curve and therapeutic index  of VDA -1102 ointment in 
AK subjects  to further determine the most appropriate treatment parameters to support a 
potential Phase 3 study . The Phase 2a trial  (VDA -CP-03) involved once -daily 200 mg 
application of 10% VDA -1102 to a 25cm2 Treatment Field on th e face or balding scalp of 
subjects with AK for  4 weeks . The study drug was well -tolerated with hardly any LSRs 
reported.  Neither VDA -1102 nor its major metabolite JA was detected in the plasma of treated 
subjects. The reduction in the number of AK lesion s in this short, proof -of-concept trial was 
mode st. 
In the completed Cohort 1 of the ongoing  dose-ranging  Study VDA -CP-04, 5 AK subjects 
applied 200 mg of 10% VDA -1102 twice -daily for 8 weeks  to a 25cm2 Treatment Field on the 
face or balding scalp . In this  small study, the reduction in AK lesions was considerably better 
(74%) than in the Phase 2a trial (32%)  and no systemic exposure was found for VDA -1102 or 
its major metabolite, s upporting an even longer ( e.g., 12 week) treatment period in order to 
obtain clinically significant complete clearance .  
The goal s of the current study (VDA -CP-05) are to evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability 
of the same total daily dose  of VDA -1102 already tested in a previous clinical study (VDA -
CP-05). This total daily dos e (1.67 mg/kg/day) will be given either as a divided dose of 10% 
VDA -1102  BID (Cohort 1) or a single dose of 20% VDA -1102 QD (Cohort 2) for a 12 -week 
treatment period. This dose (1.67 mg/kg/day) is close to 20-fold lower than the HED  of the 
NOAEL  dose determined in the 13 -week dermal toxicity study in minipigs (32 mg/kg/day) and 
is close to 30 -fold lower than the HED of the NOAEL dose determined in the oral 13-week 
toxicology study in rats (48 mg/kg/day).

CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 27 OF 78 7. STUDY DESIGN  
7.1. Study Design: Study Weeks and Visits  
This is a multi -center, open -label, 3-part, 2-cohort  Phase 2b study involving daily non -
occluded, topical dermal application of VDA -1102 ointment in subjects with actinic kera tosis 
(AK) .  The study design is summarized in Figure 1.  
To qualify for the study, male and female subjects aged 18 (inclusive) or older must have signed 
informed consent and have met the study enrollmen t criteria at the Screening Visit  and Day 1 
Pre-Dose Visit that include having 4-8 actinic keratosis (AK) lesion within an approximate 25 
cm2 area on  the cheek, forehead or balding  scalp (the “Treatment Field”).  
Part A / Cohort 1  
A total of approximately 75 subjects will be consecutively enrolled in Cohort 1. Enrolled 
subjects will apply approximately 200 mg of 10% VDA -1102 twice -daily to their Treatment 
Field for approximately 12 weeks. Safety assessments will occur on the Day 1  Pre-Dose  and 
Day 1  Dosing Visits . Safety and efficacy assessments will be repea ted at the Week 4, 8 and 
12 Visit s. This portion of the study will be called the Treatment Period .  
Subjects will return for safety and efficacy assessments at the Week 1 3 and 16 Visits  (Post-
Treatment  Follow -Up Period).   
Once approximately 40 subjects hav e been enrolled in Cohort 1, enrollment into this cohort 
will be closed and Cohort 2 will be opened to enrollment.  
Part B / Cohort 2  
Cohort 2 subjects will apply approximately 200 mg of 20% VDA -1102 to their Treatment Field  
each morning (QAM)  for approxim ately 12 weeks.  
The procedures and activities to be performed on subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 are the same as 
those to be performed on subjects in Cohort 2.  
Part C / Cohorts 1 and 2   
Once the number of subjects in Cohort 2 approximates the number in Coho rt 1, Part C of the 
study will begin wherein approximately 70 eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to either 
Cohort 1 or Cohort 2 . Thus, the trial will close with a total of approximately 75 subjects in each 
cohort.  
7.2. Study Design: Periods  
The study periods are the same for all 3 parts of the study . The study design is summarized in  
Figure 1 and further details for each study period are provided below.  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 28 OF 78 7.2.1.  Screening Period (Day -21 through Day 1 Pre -Dose ) 
During the Screening Vis it (up to approximately 21 days pre -dose) subjects who have given 
written informed consent will undergo screening, safety assessments, Treatment Field 
identification, and study drug application training.    
At the Day 1  Pre-Dose Visit, eligible subjects wi ll return to the investigative site for baseline 
assessments, final eligibility screening, Treatment Field identification, and study drug 
application training. AK lesions within the Treatment Field will be counted.  
Three times during the Screening and Day 1 Pre-Dose Visits, subjects will be trained and tested 
in proper measurement and application of the study drug to the Treatment Field with the help 
of a Dosing Card and a flexible plastic stencil (“Treatment Field Template”). Subjects unable 
to apply the study drug properly will be excluded, unless they are accompanied by a dosing 
partner willing and able to properly dose the subject each day.  
Subjects who continue to meet the enrollment criteria will be enrolled and will continue to the 
Day 1  Dosing Visi t.   
7.2.2.  Treatment Period ( Day 1  Dosing Visit through  Week 12 )  
Subjects (or their dosing partner) will apply the first dose of the study drug during the Day 1  
Dosing Visit under the supervision of the site personnel to further assure proper application. 
Subse quently, subjects will apply the study drug (10% VDA -1102 BID or 20% VDA -1102 
QAM) to their respective Treatment Fields while at home for 12 weeks. Subjects will visit their 
respective investigative sites at Week s 4, 8, and 12 for safety and efficacy asses sments, drug 
accountability, and re -training in proper application of the study drug.  
7.2.3.  Post-Treatment Follow -Up Period  (Week 13 through Week 16) 
Subjects will undergo safety and efficacy assessments at Week  13 and 16 Visits. Subjects will 
exit the trial at the conclusion of the Week 1 6 Visit procedures .

CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 33 OF 78 7.4. Dose Holidays and Dosing Adjustments  
If for any reason a subject or an Investigator dec ides to alter the prescribed dosing of the study 
drug due to a local skin reaction and/or AE, s ubject s may be offered  the following options a t 
the Investigator’s discretion.   
a) Subjects may be offered to continue the study drug, adding a bland moisturizer . The 
bland moisturizer should be applied no sooner than 6 hours after dosing and the 
Treatment Field should be washed with mild soap before the next study drug 
application.    
b) Subjects may temporarily stop the study drug for up to 7 days and to re -assess within 
that period ; 
c) Subjects may be offered to reduce the dosage, for example from 200 mg to 1 50 mg per 
once -daily application ; 
d) Subjects applying the study drug BID may be offer ed to apply their medication once -
daily  while s ubjects applying the study drug QD may be offered to apply their study 
drug e very other day ; and/or  
e) Subjects may be offered t o stop the study drug permanently .  
Subjects may be offered one of the above options or combinations thereof.  
7.5. Study Withdrawal s and Discontinuation s 
Subjects may withdra w their consent f rom participation in the study at any time. The date and 
reason for withdrawal should be recorded.  
Subjects who wish to withdraw  from the study due to  an AE related to the study drug  should 
be encouraged to remain in the study and conside r the options offered in Section 7.4 instead of 
withdrawing completely from the study. Subjects who decide to withdraw  from the study 
should be encouraged to undergo Early Termination Visit  assessments  (Section 12.6.4 ).  
Subjects who permane ntly discontinue  applying their study drug for any reason (whether on  
their own initiative or at the behest of the investigator ) should be encouraged to remain in the 
trial (not to withdraw consent from participation) so they may undergo the remaining tria l 
procedures and assessments.  The date and reason for the study drug discontinuation should be 
recorded.

misconduct, (b) violation of the r ules of the site, (c) proto col violation; (d) pregnancy, or (e ) 
unexpected personal  issues that arose during the trial. Terminations must be reported verbally 
and in writing to the Study Medical monitor within 24 hours.  
In addition, i f an Investigator (or designee) believes that  the current dosing may be detrimental 
to a subject’s well -being, that subject may be offered any of the options discussed in Section 
7.4 (Dose Holidays and Adjustments) following consultation with the Safety Medical Monitor.   
9.5.2.  Subject s Who Wish to Withdraw   
If a subject who received at least 1 dose of the study drug wishes to withdraw  from the trial, 
that subject may be offered any of the options discussed in Section 7.4 (Dose Holidays and 
Adjustments).  These options may be offered without prior consultation with the Study Medical 
Monitor.  
Subject withdrawals must be reported verbally and i n writing to the Study Medical Monitor 
within 24 hours.  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 38 OF 78 If a subject withdraws consent from the study, all data and samples (blood, urine, ECGs, etc.) 
collected prior to the time of withdrawal will be analyzed and the data will be included in the 
trial dat a base.  
9.5.3.  Subjects Lost to Follow -Up 
In the case of a subject lost to follow -up, attempts to contact the subject must be made and 
documented in the subject’s files .  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 39 OF 78 10. PROCEDURES FOR SAFET Y EVALUATIONS  
10.1. Medical History  
Medical history, including any diseases, all past surgeries including skin procedures, and 
psychiatric illnesses  will be documented.  
Each subject will be questioned regarding any planned elective procedures that may occur 
during or following completion of the study, and these must be documented i n the subject’s 
medical record and the medical history section of the CRF.   
10.2. Prior Concomitant Medications  
All medications or medical products taken by the subject within 2 months prior to S creening , 
whether the subject has stopped the medication or whethe r the subject has continued taking the 
medication, will be recorded as a Prior Concomitant Medication . This also includes 
medications taken prn.  
All topical skin treatments (i.e., medicinal or physical) received in the 4 months prior to 
Screening  will be recorded .  
10.3. Safety Measures  
10.3.1.  Adverse Events  
The investigator will  determine at each study visit  whether any AEs have occurred.  Section s 
15 and 16, respectively, contain  addit ional information regarding  AEs and SAEs . 
10.3.2.  Vital Signs, Weight, and Height  
Throughout the study, vital signs (resting blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and 
respirat ory rate) will be  obtained with the subject sitting or lying, after the subject has rested 
for at least 2 minutes.  
Heart rates are best obtained electronically, if available.  If heart rate data are obtained 
electronically, the results may not be obtained  from an ECG scheduled at the same time.  If 
these data are obtained manually, a minimum observation period of 30 sec is required.   
Respiratory rate will be determined following a minimum observation of 30 sec.  
The subject’s height and weight will be docu mented during the Screening visit.  
10.3.3.  Physical Examination  
The physical examinations performed during the  trial will include skin, external eyes, oral 
cavity, nodes, lungs, heart, abdomen, and extremit ies.   
The investigator will also be asked to assess wheth er the following neurologic functions are 
normal / abnormal.  
1. Mentation: appropriate beha vior; logical thought processes  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 40 OF 78 2. Motor: u se of all 4 extremities  
3. Cerebellar: gait; balance standing and sitting  
4. Cranial nerves: s peech , facial symmetry , and hearing  
If any of these is abnormal or changed from baseline, the Investigator will be asked to describe 
the findings.  
All abnormal acute and chronic findings on physical examination must be recorded whether 
they are new or were recorded previously in the medical re cords of the subject . For example, a 
surgical scar should be recorded on every scheduled physical examination.  
AK lesions that are outside the Treatment Field must  be recorded in the physical examination. 
This applies to AK lesions on the head or on any ot her part of the body. However, only lesions 
that require treatment at the time of the examination should be considered clinically signific ant. 
Please refer to Section 12.9.1  regarding which AK treatments are al lowed and prohibited during 
the trial.   
All other skin lesions must be reported on the physical examination.  However, o nly skin lesions 
that require treatment at the time of the examination should be considered clinically significant.   
10.3.4.  Clinical Laborator y Tests  
Blood and urine sampling will be collected and sent for analysis to CRL the central laboratory 
and will occur as listed in Section 12.6 and the Table of Study Assessments  (Section  7.3).  All 
blood samples will be drawn, prepared, and maintained as per central laboratory  manual . Blood 
sampling for all clinical laboratory tests should be performed followi ng a fasting period of 
approximately 8 hours with the exception of the Screening blood sampling that may be 
performed  randomly (i.e., with or without fasting).  The fasting status of the subject will be 
recorded.  
The following tests will be performed as part of the Clinical Laboratory Tests:  
a) Hematology :  The hematology analysis will consist of the following tests:  
• White Blood Cell Count  
• White Blood Cell Differential in absol ute numbers  only (not percent)  
• Hemoglobin  
• Hematocrit  
• Mean Corpuscular Volume  (MCV)  
• Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration  (MCHC)

b) Coagulation Profile:   The coagulation parameter analysis will consist of the following 
tests:  
• Prothrombin Time (PT) and/or International Normalized Ratio (INR)  
• Activate Par tial Thromboplastin (aPTT)  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 41 OF 78 c) Complete Clinical Chemistry:   The Complete Clinical Chemistry consists of the following 
tests:  
• ALT  
• AST  
• Albumin  
• Alkaline phosphatase

• Glomerular filtration rate , estimated  (as 
per the clinical laboratory’s SOPs)  
 
d) Urinalysis:   The urinalysis consists of the follo wing tests:  
• Glucose  • Erythrocytes  
• Protein  • Leucocytes  
• pH • Nitrites  
• Ketones   
10.3.5.  Urine Pregnancy Test  
Pregnancy testing will be performed on urine samples to be pr ocessed, assayed, and reported 
by si te personnel .  
All women enrolled in the trial must have a ne gative urine pregn ancy test  at their  Screening 
and Day 1  Pre-Dose  Visits before they can proceed to Day 1  Dosing.  
10.3.6.  Electrocardiogram  
A standard, surface 12 -lead ECG will be obtained as per the central ECG laboratory’s manual 
at the time points listed in th e Schedule of Assessments ( 7.3).  
ECGs recorded, transmitted to the central ECG laboratory, and interpreted  by that laboratory .  
The QT interval results will be adjusted for rate using the Bazett (QTcB) and Fridericia (QTcF) 
corrections.  
Cardiac dysrhythmias will be documented by occurrence (date and time), severity, type, and 
duration.  Isolated premature ventricular contractions and supraventricular extra -systolic 
waveforms will not be con sidered clinically significant.  
Two printouts (original copies) of each  electrocardiog ram will be stored in the subjects’ 
medical records. ECGs will be asses sed, signed, and dated by the Investigator  (or designee).  
The Investigator’s initial assessment is for purposes of screening and safety follow -up only.  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 42 OF 78 The Investigator’s findings will be in cluded in the final data base for insertion into listings. 
However, these findings will not be tabulated , included in summary statistics , or considered 
the official reading of record for purposes of study safety assessments .   
All ECGs will be electronical ly transmitted to the central ECG laboratory  for interpretation . 
The central ECG interpretation overrides the investigator’s and will be considered the official 
reading of record  for purposes of study safety assessments.   
10.3.7.  Local Skin Reaction Score   
The Investigator (or designee) will use the Local Skin Reaction ( LSR) Score (see Section 22.1) 
to numerically assess the overall degree of erythema, edema, weeping / exudate, vesicles, 
erosions / ulcerations, scaling / dryness, scabbing  / crusting  as well as  the Subjective LSR Score  
(Section 0) to assess  itching and pain in the Treatment Field . The assessments will use a 5-
point scale, from 0 (none /trace ) to 4 ( extreme ).  This assessme nt will be performed on Day 1  
Visit  and repeated at each subsequent visit.  The individual scores for each potential finding 
will be recorded in the respective cells by the assessor.  
Whenever possible, the same investigator should perform all of these asse ssments.  
In this trial LSRs  will be collected independent  of AEs.  Details regarding LSR reporting are 
included in Section 15.1.  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 43 OF 78 11. PROCEDURES FOR EFFIC ACY EVALUATIONS  
11.1. AK Lesions  
11.1.1.  AK Lesion Count  
At the Screening and Day 1  Pre-Dose Visits, the selected Treatment Field must include 4-8 
discrete qualifying AK lesion and no disqualifying lesions (Section 11.1.3 ).  
At the Day 1  Pre-Dose Visit, all AK lesions in the selected contiguous 25 cm2 Treatment Field 
will be identified, counted, and recorded. The  approximate outline of e ach AK lesion will be 
transcribed on the Treatment Fiel d Map  on Day 1 . A photograph of the subject’s Treatment 
Field will be taken and a copy given to the Subject to assist the subject in locating their 
Treatment Field.  
At visit s after Day 1  specified below, the investigator will be given the Day 1  Treatment Map  
and Photograph of the Treatment Field  for reference and asked to count the number of AK 
lesions identified within the Treatment Field .  
If new AK lesions appear in the Treatment Field  after Day 1 , they will be counted .  
If the subject has a LSR that prevents  the investigator or designee from performing the AK 
count at a visit, the investigator or designee should document in the source document and CRF 
that the AK count was not obtained due to LSR  local effects . 
11.1.2.  Definition of AK Lesion Clearance  
A prior AK les ion that is no longer seen OR no longer palpable is to be considered cleared  and 
will not be counted , even if a residual color or skin texture change remains in the skin.  
11.1.3.  AK Lesion  Eligibility  
To be eligible for this trial, the Treatment Field must  contain  4-8 AK lesion s that meet each of 
the following criteria:  
a. Grade 1 or 2 AK lesions  only - not Grade 3 ; The definitions of AK Grades to be used 
for eligibility purposes are as follows:  
– Grade 1 – mild (slightly palpable AK that are felt better than seen)  
– Grade 2 – moderate (moderately thick AK that are easily seen and felt)  
– Grade 3 - severe (very thick , obvious , and/or hyperkeratotic  AK). Treatment Fields 
selected for this trial must not contain any Grade 3 AK lesions . 
b. located on the subject’s head i ncluding  the face or balding scalp but not on the  lips, 
ears, submandibular area, or neck;  
c. located in an area of the subject’s head that easily  visible to the subject in a mirror;  
d. discrete (i.e., no borders that are clearly touching one another) ;  
e. a maximum diame ter 10 mm (inclusive) in any direction ; and 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 44 OF 78 f. not atrophic, pigmented, or Bowenoid.  
AK lesions grades will not be recorded in the CRF since the AK lesion grades are not an 
endpoint in this study.  
11.2. Treatment Field  Selection  
Any 25 cm2 contiguous area on the f ace or scalp of the subject that contains  4-8 AK l esion s 
that meet the requirements stated in AK Lesion Eligibility criteria (Section 11.1.3 ) may be 
selected as the study Treatment Field. The Treatment Field wi ll be selected at Screening and 
confirmed on Day 1  Pre-Dose. If the Treatment Field selected at Screenin g is no longer eligible 
at Day 1  Pre-Dose, a new Treatmen t Field m ust be selected on Day 1  Pre-Dose.  
The Treatment F ield must be a single, contiguous  25 cm2 area that is easily  visible to the subject 
when looking  in the mirror. The Treatment Field  should include at least 4 but not more than 8 
AK lesions all of which must be Grade 1 or 2 AK lesions.  The ideal Treatment Field should 
optimally  be square o r rectangular and not irregular, to simplify study drug application  by the 
subject .  
The Treatment Field  or its outer border  must not be: 
a) An area of skin that received any AK or other medical or physical treatment within 4 
months of the Day 1 Visit  (Exclusio n Criterion #1 4);  
b) Within 2.5 cm ( ~1 inch) of either labial commissure of the mouth, lip vermilion border, 
palpebral f issure or a suspected malignancy ; 
c) Close to another active dermatologic process that could spread to the Treatment Field 
and interfere with  the proper assessment of the Treatment Field and/or its included AK 
lesions;  
d) So close to the eyebrows , beard , or other area with hair as to interfere with proper 
application of the study drug or assessment of the Treatment Field .  
NOTE: Ideally other AKs should NOT  be adjacent to the bo rder of the Treatment Field 
which could confound t he AK lesion counting or identification of  the Treatment Field at 
subsequent study visits.  
11.3. Study Tools  
The following four (4) study tools will be used for Treatment Field sel ection , AK Lesion 
counts, Study Drug measurement, and Study Drug Application. The preliminary tools w ill be 
supplied by the Sponsor. Investigator s (or designee) will prepare the final tools for use by the 
sites and the subject  based upon the instructions p rovided by the Sponsor.   
1. Treatment Field Map  - This flexible, 8.5 x 11 -inch plastic transparency with 1 cm x 1 
cm grid printed on the surface will be used by the Investigator (or designee) to : (a) define 
a Treatment Field at Screening and Day 1 Pre -Dose V isits; (b) count AK lesions in the 
Treatment Field; and ( c) to create the Treatment Field Template. Instructions r egarding 
use of this tool will be distributed to the site.  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 45 OF 78 2. Treatment Field Template – The tool consists of a  clear, thin, flexible, 8.5 x 11 -inch 
plastic transparency sheet supplied by the Sponsor marked by the Investigator (or 
designee) with landmarks (e.g. eyebrows, ear helix, and/or nevi) to guide the subject to 
the proper placement of the sheet. The template also includes a cut -out hole tha t will act 
as a stencil, guiding the Subject (or dosing partner) to the precise Treatment Field for 
application of the study drug.  This template (stencil) will be used by the:  
a. Investigator (or designee)  (a) to train the subject in proper identification of their 
unique Treatment Field; and ( b) to train the subject in precise study drug application 
to their unique Treatment Field.  
b. Subject (or dosing partner):  (a) to identify their unique Treatment Field and (b) to 
apply the study drug precisely to their Treat ment Field.  
Instructions regarding use of this tool will be distributed to the site.  
3. Dosing Card – a, thin plastic card with a rectangle printed on the middle of the card . A 
strip of ointment expressed from the study drug tube that fits the clear po rtion  of the 
rectangle is the correct approximate dose of study drug to be applied to the Treatment 
Field. A new previously unused Dosing Card will be used for each application by the 
subject to measure their proper study drug dose  and will be discarded after u se.  
Instructions r egarding use of this tool will be distributed to the site.  
4. Treatment Field Photograph – At least 1  standard facial photograph that include s the 
Treatment Field and its surrounding landmarks may be taken of each subject. The sole 
purpose  of this photography to supplement the use of the Treatment Field Template in 
guiding the site and the  subject to the  subject’s precise Treatment Field. The photograph 
that best represents the Treatment Field will be printed . The site personnel will label  the 
photograph  with “left” and “right” as well as point out landmarks on the picture to subject 
(e.g. moles, eyebrows, or nose) in order to properly orient the subject . The subject will be 
given the labelled photograph for use with the template  and retenti on in the subject’s 
source documentation.   
 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 46 OF 78 12. CONDUCT OF THE STUDY  
12.1. Study Blinding and Randomization  
12.1.1.  Study Blinding  
This is an open -label study. Therefore, no one will be blinded.  
12.1.2.  Randomization  
Subjects who pass screening and are eligible for enrollment will  be consecutively enrolled into 
Part A (Cohort 1) and Part B (Cohort 2). There will be no need for randomization in Part A or 
Part B.  
Subjects enrolled into Part C will be randomly assigned  to Cohort 1 or to Cohort 2 at a ratio of 
1:1 to allow for equal e xpansion of the number of subjects into each of these cohorts. Details 
regarding the randomizat ion technique(s) will be detailed in the SAP. On Day 1 Pre -Dose, after 
confirming the subject’s eligibility, the Investigator (or his designee) will approve the subject’s 
unblin ded randomization . Subjects will be randomized in a fashion that will maintain a balance 
between  the 2 cohorts across all subjects enrolled (not per site)  and notify the site of the result.   
12.2. Pre-Screening  
Sites are encouraged to pre -screen  subjects prior to consenting. The FDA guidance regarding 
which pre -screening procedures may be performed may be found on the FDA web site at: 
http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInfo rmation/Guidances/ucm126430.htm .  
12.3. Subject Informed Consent  
No activitie s other than pre -screening procedures (including Screening activities) may be 
performed before a fully executed IRB approved current informed consent form (ICF) has been 
obtained, with  a copy of the ICF given to the subject and another copy placed in the subject’s 
medical records.  
Information about the study, explaining the objectives , procedures, and potential risks versus 
benefits will be given to the subject in writing and verbally in a language that is understood by 
the subject.  The subject should have adequate time to read the information and to ask the 
Investigator any questions.  The Investigator must be satisfied that the subject has understood 
the information provided in the I CF before written consent is obtained.  
12.4. General Considerations  
12.4.1.  Demographics  
The birth date, gender, race, and ethnicity of each subject will be documented.

12.9.6.  Physical  Exercise  Restric tions  
There are no restrictions placed upon physical exercise.  However, s ubjects should not swim or 
perform strenuous activities within 6 hours after applying the study drug. If the subject would 
like to perform such activities, the study drug application  should  be postponed until after the 
activity has been completed.  
12.10.  Childbearing Potential  
12.10.1.  Definitions  
Childbearing Potential:   Female subjects with at least one of the following medical conditions 
will be considered lacking childbearing potential:  
a) aged ≥  50 years and last normal menstrual period was at least 12 months prior to 
Screening ; 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 56 OF 78 b) undergone removal of her entire uter us (total hysterectomy); bilateral tubal ligation at 
least 6 months prior to Screening and/ or bilateral oophorectomy  
Females who do not meet at least 1 of the above criteria or do not have at least 1 criterion 
documented in the Medical History will be cons idered capable of childbearing and must be 
willing and able to use an acceptable form of contraception. Any subject meets th is definition 
for childbearing and who cannot use an acceptable form of contraception, must be excluded 
from the study under Exclusion Criterion #3  (Section 9.2).  
Acceptable forms of contraception  are: a) hormonal contraceptives [e.g., oral, transdermal, 
injectable, or intravaginal], b) barrier methods [condom and spermicidal or diaphragm/cervical 
cap and spermicidal], c) partner vasectomy (performed at lea st six months prior to study entry), 
or d) total abstinence. Subjects who become sexually active or begin to have relations with a 
partner who is not sterile during the study must agree to use an effective form of birth control 
for the duration of the stud y. 
Urine Pregnancy T est (UPT) :  All women enrolled in the trial must have a neg ative UPT  at 
Screening  and on Day 1  Pre-Dose before first study drug dosing . In addition, a ll women must 
also underg o a UPT  testing approximately one week after the  final study drug application . 
12.10.2.  Contraception  
Women with childbearing potential (as defined in Section 12.10.1 ) must be able and willing to 
use a contraceptive method describes in that section , from Screening until 1 month f ollowing 
the final study drug applicati on. 
Non-vasectomized male  subject s with female partners without childbearing potential (as 
defined in Section 12.10.1 ) are not required to use contraception.  
Non-vasectom ized male  subjects  with female partners with childbearing potential (as defined 
in Section 12.10.1 ) must agree to use an acceptable form of contraception (as defined in Section 
12.10.1 ) from Screening until  3 months  after the last dose of study drug and must refrain from 
sperm donation for 3 months after the last dose of study drug .

Subjects will be instructed to keep  the study drug  tube in the accompanyi ng cardboard 
container  and to keep this unit  in their home refrigerator.   
Travel  
If a subject must  transport the study drug  (for example, while travelling on vacation , on 
business , or to the site ) they will be instructed  to protect the study drug from hea t in the supplied 
cooler pack . The drug should not be placed in the trunk of a car or in checked luggage on a 
plane.  
Subjects planning to travel away from home should contact their site in order to receive 
instructions how to properly care for the study d rug. 
13.6. Study Drug Dispensing and Administration  
13.6.1.  Study Drug Dispensing   
Following conclusion of the Day 1  Pre-Dose procedures, the Investigator (or designee) will 
assure that the subject still meets all the study enrollment criteria. The investigator may then  
approve subject enrolment .  
Site personnel (or instit utional pharmacist) will allocate the appropriate study drug for each 
subject. The tube with its aluminum envelope will  be removed from the cardboard container  in 
which it was stored while refrigerated.  The aluminum envelope will be opened by site 
personnel and the tube removed.  The aluminum envelope will be ret ained at the site for 
monitoring purposes and the tube will be returned to  the container until dosing time.   
Subjects will receive a new tube o f the study drug at Day 1  Dosing , Week 4, and Week 8 Visits  
and tubes wil l be retu rned by the subjects at Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12 Visits.   
13.6.2.  Study Drug Dosing Cards  
Study Drug Dosing Cards will be distributed to the site.  These cards will be used: (a) by site 
personnel to train and to test subjects in the proper length of the study drug oi ntment strip to 
be expressed and applied to the Treatment Field, and (b) by enrolled subjects to measure the 
appropriate length of study drug oin tment to be applied to their  Treatment Field.    
13.6.3.  Study Drug Measurement and Application Review  
All sites will re ceive tubes of placebo with which to train all subjects to measure the appropriate 
quantity of study drug to be applied. These training tubes will be clearly marked.  
Using the Treatment Field photograph and Template, placebo training ointment, and a Study  
Drug Dosing Card, the subject will be trained and tested in proper and precise dosing  
techniques.  
Note: Training tubes containing placebo ointment will only be used to practice 
measurement of the proper study drug dose  on the Dosing Card and not for appl ication 
to the face during training and testing.   
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 59 OF 78 Screening Visit  
Subjects will be trained and tested by site personnel at the Screening Visit. The subject will be 
taught to measure the study drug using placebo tubes supplied by the Sponsor. The subjects 
will also be taught how to apply the study drug, but they will not use the placebo for this part 
of the training. In other words, placebo should not be applied to their skin during the training.  
Subjects who have difficulty measuring the dose or applying the study drug to the precisely 
may be asked to bring a dosing partner with them to the Day 1 Pre -Dose Visit. This dosing 
partner must be willing and able to assist the subject with study drug application once every 
evening for 84 days.  
If the subject (or  their dosing partner) is unlikely to apply the study drug appropriately, the 
subject should be terminated from the study based on Inclusion # 3 (Section 9.1).  
Day 1  Pre-Dose Visit  
Subjects who continue to meet  the study enrollment criteria following Screening will be trained 
and tested twice  by site personnel during the Day 1  Pre-Dose Visit: once at the beginning of 
the visit and once again at the end of the visit before randomization. If the subject (or dosing  
partner) is unlikely to apply the study drug appropriately, the subject should be excluded from 
the study based on Inclusion # 3 (Section 9.1). 
Day 1  Dosing Visit  
Dosing at this visit will occur under the supervision of the site personnel.  If at this visit the 
subject (or their dosing partner) is unable to precisely prepare the study drug or is unable to 
properly locate the Treatment Fiel d, they should be withdrawn before the study drug is 
applied  and considered a screening failure.  Application of the study drug during this visit 
will be the same as described in Section 13.6.4 , below.  
13.6.4.  Study Dr ug Administration  at Home   
The study drug will be applied to the Treatment Field by the subject or their dosing partner . 
Subjects in Cohort 1 will apply approximately 200 mg of 10%VDA -1102 each morning before 
10:00 am and each evening at least 3 hours prio r to bedtime. Subjects in Cohort 2 will apply 
approximately 200 mg of 20%VDA -1102 each morning before 10:00 am.  
Cohorts 1 and 2:  The morning dose  should be applied before 10 am . If a subject knows that 
they will perspire, shower, vigorously exercise, etc. before 10 am, application of the study 
drug should be delayed until completion of those activities.  
Cohort 1 only:  The evening dose should be applied  each day  at least 3 hours  before bedtime.  
If the subject would like to shower, wash their face, shampoo  their hair, etc. , these should 
be performed prior to study drug application . 
At the dosing time, the subject should check the Treatment Field  in the mirror to assure it is 
clean and dry.  
The study drug tube will be removed from the container, the tube cov er unscrewed, and the 
study drug ointment expressed as a strip into the rectangle printed on  the supplied Dosing Card .  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 60 OF 78 Using a mirror , Treatment Field photograph,  and/or the landmarks drawn on the Treatment 
Field Template , the template  will be appropriate ly positioned on t he subjec t’s face or scalp . 
The subject (or dosing partner) will apply the study drug to the Treatment Field on their skin 
that corresponds to the 25 cm2 area cut out of the template. S ubject s (or their dosing partner s) 
will apply the stu dy drug with one finger to the center of the Treatment Field and spread the 
ointment evenly over the entire field. The Treatment Field will not be occluded.  The subject 
will remove the T reatment Field Template from their  face.  With the same finger, t he su bject 
will spread ointment at the periphery of the Treatment Field approximately ¼ inch beyond the 
Treatment Field perimeter to ensure that  the whole Treatment Field was covered with study 
drug.  
After each study drug application, the subject’s hands shoul d be very carefully washed  
with warm water and soap .  
The subject will be instructed not to wet or touch the Treatment Field. Subjects should not 
perform activities that might cause wetting or excessive sweating of the Treatment Field , for 
approximately 6 hours after dosing .  
After each dosing, the Dosing Diary must be completed.  
13.7. Study Drug Accountability and Dosing Compliance  
13.7.1.  Study Drug Site Accountability  
Study sites  will be asked  to acknowledge receipt of the study drugs on the day of arrival at the 
site.  The site pharmacist and/or the assigned site personnel will be responsible for drug 
inventory . A drug inventory record should be maintained by the person responsible for 
dispensing the study drug to the subject.  This should record which supplies arrived at the site 
and which container(s) is issued to each subject . The Sponsor  should be notified of details of 
any supplies which are inadvertently damaged.  Details of any supplies which are inadvertently 
damaged or unaccountable for any reason should be documented  on th e drug inventory record, 
which will be col lected at the end of the study.   
All study drug will be inventoried by the monitor during and at the conclusion of the study.  
Secure disposal or re turn of unused supplies to the S ponsor at the end  of the study will be 
arranged. Sufficient study drug will be given to each subject to allow for proper dosing between 
site visits .  
13.7.2.  Study Drug Accountability and Dosing Compliance  
Study drug distributed to each subject and returned by each subject will be  documented in the 
Drug Accountability Log.  
Dosing cards will be distributed and collected with study drug. Subjects will complete a Dosing 
Diary  with the date and time of each dosing. Missed doses will be recorded. Dosing cards will 
be used to assess sub ject compliance.  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 61 OF 78 13.7.3.  Study Drug Weighing  
Each new (unused) study drug tube will be weighed before the first dose is dispense d. As part 
of study drug accountability, study t ubes returned by the subjects at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 will be 
weighed . Study  drug weights  will be recorded  and t hese data will be used to assess subject 
compliance.  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 62 OF 78 14. CONCOMITANT MEDICATI ON 
Any prescription or non -prescription medication, alternative medication, herbal product, 
homeopathic substance, etc. that the subject receives while they are enrolled in the tria l or that 
was taken within 2 months  of Screening will be referred to as a Concomitant Medication. The 
Investigator is to record the use of all concomitant medications, both prescribed and over -the-
counter, in the subject medical record .   
Subjects should b e advised against taking any new medication, both prescribed and over -the-
counter, without consulting the Investigator, unless the new medication is urgently required for 
emergency  use.  Subjects taking medication other than those listed as prohibited in S ection 
12.9.1  may continue taking their routine medications and vitamins so long as they have been 
taking them for at least 2 months prior to Screening with no change in dose  or dosing interval.  
At Screening and Day 1  Pre-Dose Visits, the study site personnel w ill review  each subject’s 
concomitant medications to ensure that subjects are not taking any prohibited medications 
listed in Section 12.9.1 . 
The Investigator  and his designees are obligated to ensure the well -being of all subjects during 
this study. Consequently, no medication or treatment should be withheld from a subject 
requiring medical intervention.  This may include treatments received by the subject prior to 
enrollment as well as in response to any new m edical conditions that developed during the 
study.  The Investigator (or designee) must inform a subject when concomitant medical 
intervention or treatment is indicated and report this in the appropriate section of the CRF.  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 63 OF 78 15. ADVERSE EVENTS  
15.1. Adverse Event De finition s 
15.1.1.  General  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with the pharmaceutical product treatment.  Any worsening of the subject’s disease 
under study or other medical conditions will also be  considered to be an AE, unless it is within 
the normal range of disease fluctuation for that subject.  
Abnormal clinically significant changes in physical examination or vital signs should be 
recorded as AEs.   
15.1.2.  Local Skin Reactions  
In this trial Local Skin  Reactions ( LSRs ) will not be recorded as AEs unless they (a) 
require treatment with a prescri bed medic ation ; (b) extend >2 centimeter s beyond the 
border of the Treatment Field ; or (c) require a study drug dose adjustment . 
15.1.3.  Laboratory and ECG Data  
Abnormal clinical laboratory or ECG finding s should be reported as an AE are as follows:  
1. Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms ; 
2. Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention ; 
3. Test result leads to a change in stud y dosing , discontinuation from the study, initiation of a 
prescription medication , or surgical intervention ; and  
4. Test result leads to any of the outcomes included in the definition of a SAE.  
If such an event occurs, the test should be repeated within appro ximately 7  days to confirm 
the finding and appropriately monitored.  The mere repetition of an abnormal test, in the 
absence of any of the above conditions, does not fulfil  Condition 2 above for reporting as an 
AE. Any abnormal test result that is determin ed to be an error does not require reporting as an 
AE. 
15.1.4.  Miscellaneous Definitions  
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)  are AEs that occur de novo  or worsen 
following the initiation of study treatment.  
Surgical procedures  themselves are not AEs; they a re therapeutic measures taken due to an  
AE and they should be documented as such.   
Planned hospital admissions  documented in the subject’s medical record  prior to enrolment 
and study -related procedures are also not to be reported as AEs.  
Overdoses  of the study drug will not be reported as an AE. However, any AEs or SAEs, as 
defined in Section 15, associated with an overdose will be reported as such.  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 64 OF 78 15.2. Clarification of the Difference between “Severe” and “Serious”  
Severity describes the intensity of an event, irrespective of its medical significance (such as 
severe headache).  This is not the same as seriousness, which is based on regulatory definitions. 
Seriousness (not severity) defines SAE reporting obligations.   The severity of all AEs will be 
graded on a 3 -point scale (mild, moderate, severe) and reported in detail on the CRF.   
• Mild: Discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity.  
• Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect daily activity . 
• Severe: Inability to work or perform normal daily activity.  
15.3. AE Reporting  
Specific instructions regarding the reporting of AEs, including start and stop dates, relationship 
to study drug, outcomes, expectedness, etc. will be detailed in the Safety Monitor ing Plan.  
15.4. Relationship to Study Treatments  
“Causality” refers to the relationship  of the AE to the study drug. The investigator must include 
assessment of causality (whether there is a reasonable possibility the drug caused the event) for 
each AE. Causali ty will be categorized according to the following criteria:  
 
• Not Related : There is no medical evidence to suggest that the AE may  be related to 
study drug usage and other causes are much  more likely.  
• Unlikely Related:  There is no  medical evidence to sugge st that the AE may be related 
to study drug usage , but a relationship cannot be completely ruled out. There are other 
more likely causes.  
• Possibly Related: There is weak medical evidence to suggest that the AE may be 
related to study drug usage  and a rela tionship cannot be completely ruled out . 
• Likely Related: There is good medical evidence to suggest that the AE may  be related 
to study drug usage but other causes cannot be ruled out completely.   
• Related: There is a strong and convincing medical evidence t o suggest that the AE  is 
related to study drug usage and other possible causes are highly unlikely.  
15.5. Follow -up of Adverse Events  
All AE related symptoms and/or signs will be followed until there is a return to the baseline 
status, all associated parameters have returned to normal (or are no longer considered clinically 
significant), stabilized, or no further improvement is anticipated.  Follow -up is mandatory, 
irrespective of causal relationship to the study drug(s).  SAEs will be monitored until resolution  
or stabilized  as medically indicated.  Any subject who has received at least 1 dose of the study 
drug and has experienced an AE that has not resolved or stabilized , may be invited to attend 
and unscheduled visits . Subjects with AEs that have not resolved o r stabilized should be 
followed until resolution of the AE or for a minimum of 30  days after the subject’s last 
application of the study medication.  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 65 OF 78 16. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
16.1. Definition  
An SAE is any AE that, at any dose, results in at least one of the follow ing outcomes:  
1. Death.  Death is an outcome, not an event.  Where the cause of death is uncertain, the 
reported SAE should be the same as the term on the subject’s death certificate.  
2. Life-threatening.  Life -threatening means that the subject was at immediate  risk of death at 
the time of the SAE; it does not refer to an SAE that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe.  
3. Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization.  
4. Persistent or significant disability or incapacity. “Persistent or signif icant disability or 
incapacity” means that there is a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to carry out 
normal life functions.  
5. Congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
6. Medically serious event based upon appropriate medical judgment.  Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
16.2. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Full details of SAE reporting will be based on the ICH guidelines for reporting SAEs and 
will appear in the study Safety Monitoring Plan.  
If the AE is serious, the Investigator must complete an SAE Report form, in addition to the AE 
page in the CRF. In addition, when a non -serious event becomes serious, details must be 
forwarded, within 24 hours of Investigator awareness that an AE has become serious, to the 
Sponsor or designee on an SAE Report form, with the date of the seriousness upg rade as the 
SAE start date.  
The SAE Report Form must be completed in accordance with instructions provided by the 
Sponsor or designee.  The completed form must be emailed to Dr. Chaim Brickman, the Study 
Safety Monitor , within 24 hours of discovery of  the SAE.  
The initial report must be as complete as possible, including details of the current illness and 
the SAE, and an assessment of the causal relationship between the event and the investigational 
product(s) or the study procedures.  
Information not avail able at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for the AE or 
laboratory values received after the report) must be documented as a follow -up on the SAE 
Report form.  
Any SAE, whether or not related to the study treatment, must be reported within 2 4 hours to 
the Study Medical Monitor and the CRO responsible for the site.  The following contact and 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 66 OF 78 communication methods may be used. The Medical Monitor and CRO will confirm receipt 
upon receiving the notification.

If, for any reason, the Investigator cannot notify the Study Safety Monitor via the appropriate 
form or if the Investigator suspects that using this  method will delay the notification (e.g., 
during a holiday period), the Investigator must verbally notify the Sponsor Medical Monitor 
(or designee) via telephone.  The SAE Report form must still be relayed at the earliest possible 
opportunity.  SAEs must be reported to the IRB according to IRB guidelines.  
All ancillary documentation (e.g. discharge letters, laboratory reports and consultations) must 
be sent to the Sponsor or designee.  In the event of an SAE resulting in death, post -mortem 
reports should be routinely sent to the Sponsor or designee.  
All subjects with SAEs must be followed -up for outcome.  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 67 OF 78 17. STATISTICAL PLAN  
17.1. Sample Size Rationale and Justification  
The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of topical VDA -1102 
ointment in subjects with actinic keratosis. Approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled in this 
2-cohort clinical trial. In each cohort, approximately 75 subjects will be enrolled in order to 
complete each cohort with safety and efficacy data from at least 70  subjects who received study 
drug. Considering the results from a previous Phase 2  parallel, randomized, placebo -controlled 
study with a sample size of 29 to 32 subjects per treatment group , this sample size is considered 
adequate to evaluate the stated ob jectives.  A formal sample size calculation was not performed.  
17.2. Statistical analysis  
All measured variables and derived parameters will be listed individually and, if appropriate, 
tabulated by descriptive statistics. Data will be summarized by cohort and vi sit, if appropriate.  
Unless stated otherwise, the term “descriptive statistics” refers to number of subjects (n), mean, 
median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and maximum for continuous data and frequencies 
and percentages for categorical data. The dat a will be analyzed using the SAS® version 9.4 or 
higher (SAS Institute, Cary North Carolina).  Details of all statistical analyses to be performed 
will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
17.3. Secondary Efficacy Analys es 
17.3.1.  Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The proportion of subjects achieving complete clearance of AK lesions within their Treatment 
Field will be summarized by cohort and visit. The 95% confidence interval for the percentage 
will be calculated using the Clopper -Pearson method for binomial prop ortions. The analysis 
will be conducted on the modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) population, mITT Face (mITT -Face) 
subpopulation, Per Protocol population (PP), and PP Face (PP -Face) subpopulation.  
17.3.2.  Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The proportion of subjects achiev ing partial (≥75%) clearance of AK lesions within their 
Treatment Field will be summarized by cohort and visit. The 95% confidence interval for the 
percentage will be calculated using the Clopper -Pearson method for binomial proportions.  
The number of facia l AK lesions in the Treatment Field, change from baseline values, and 
percent change from baseline values will be summarized by cohort and visit.  
These analyses will be conducted on the modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) population, mITT 
Face (mITT -Face) subp opulation, Per Protocol population (PP), and PP Face (PP -Face) 
subpopulation.  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 68 OF 78 17.4. Safety Assessments  
The safety end point data will be summarized for the ITT population.  AEs will be categorized 
by System Organ Class (SOC) and Prefe rred Terms (PT) using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version 19.1 or higher).  The incidence of AEs, as well as the 
intensity and relationship to study drug will be summarized by cohort .  Safety will also be 
assessed by evaluating  findings of physical examinations, vital signs, clinical laboratory test 
results, 12 -lead ECG tracings, Local Skin Reaction Score, drug exposure, concomitant 
medications, Urine P regnancy Test results, withdrawals/terminations , and dose adjustments .  
These  findings will be summarized and compared to findings from baseline evaluations.   
Local Skin Reaction (L SR) Scores  will be summarized .     
17.5. Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
Not applicable.  
17.6. Missing Data  
Every effort will be made to obtain required data at each sc heduled visit from all subjects who 
have been enrolled. Details regarding  the handling of missing data will be presented in the 
SAP.  
17.7. Data Sets  
17.7.1.  Safety  Population  
The Safety  population will be defined as all subjects who are randomize d and who receive 
study drug.  Safety analyses will be performed on the  Safety population.  
17.7.2.  Modified ITT (mITT) Population  
The modified Intent -to-Treat  (mITT) population will be defined as all subjects who are enrolled 
into the study, received any study drug, and did not fail Exclusion Criterion #2 .  Subjects in 
this population will be analyzed according to the cohort to which they were allocated. All 
efficacy  analyses will be performed on the mITT  population.  
17.7.3.  Per Protocol Population  
Subjects without  violations or major devia tions will be included in the Per Protocol P opulation. 
All e fficacy analyses  will be repeat ed on this population.  
17.7.4.  Face Subpopulation  
Subjects whose Treatment Fields are located on their face (i.e., che eks or forehead) will 
constitute the ITT -Face, mITT -Face, and PP -Face populations.  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 69 OF 78 17.7.5.  Pharmacokinetic Population  
Not applicable.  
17.8. Definitions of the Terms Violation and Deviation  
Violation  – Any enrolled subject who does not meet the study enrollment criteria (see Inclusion 
and Exclusion Criteria in Section  9) will be considered a violation.  
Deviation  – Any activity that diverges from the procedures defined by this clinical protocol 
will be considered a deviation.  
A major deviation  is one that will definitely, probably , or possibly sign ificantly impact the 
subject safety or the quality of the trial data. An example of a major deviation is a subject who 
missed dosing >7 consecutive days of study drug.  
A minor deviation  is one that does not, or is unlikely to, significantly impact subject  safety or 
the quality of the trial data.  
All violations and deviations must be rec orded in the study site’s electronic system and signed 
by the Investigator  (or designee).  
A Violation and Deviation Review Meeting that includes mem bers of the study team f rom the 
Sponsor and the Statistical Management CRO will determine which subjects meet the above 
definitions. Details of this meeting will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan. It is the 
Sponsor’s responsibility to determine whether the event will b e considered a violation, major 
deviation, or minor deviation.   
17.9. Subject Compliance  
Subjects will record administered and missed doses in their Dosing Diaries. Study drug tubes 
will also be weighed at each site visit.  
17.10.  Demographic and Baseline Characteris tics 
The comparability of the cohort s will be summarized by the evaluation of the demographic 
information, including age, gender, and country.   
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 70 OF 78 18. STUDY  MANAGEMENT AND DATA COLLECTION  
18.1. Data Collection Methods  
Trained investigational site staff will enter the data req uired by the protocol into the eCRFs 
from source documents .  All information on the eCRFs must be traceable to these source 
documents.  Instances of missing or uninterpretable data will be discussed with the study site 
for resolution.  The study si te is responsible for providing missing data and resolutions to the 
data queries and for correcting  the eCRFs as appropriate.  eCRFs must be reviewed, signed, 
and dated by the Investigator.  All original laboratory and ECG reports will be kept with the 
subject source documentation and a copy will be transmitted to the Sponsor (or designee), if 
required.  
ECGs  should be tra nsmitt ed to the central laboratory the same day the data are obtained, if 
possible.  
18.2. Monitoring  
Vidac Pharma (or their designee) will conduct site visits to the investigation facilities for the 
purpose of monitoring a ll aspect s of the study.   
18.3. Data Retention  
All relevant correspondence (e.g. with the Sponsor, CRO, IRB, etc.) relating to this clinical 
study conduct should be maintained in  the appropriate file at the site.  
The Investigator must retain  all records, including the source documents, ICFs, laboratory 
reports including ECGs, and all other study -related documentation for a period of at least 2 
years following the date the last mar keting application is approved for the study drug for the 
indication for which it is being investigated, or 2 years after the date that the FDA has been 
notified that all clinical investigation of the drug has been discontinued, whichever is greater, 
unles s notified otherwise in writing by the Sponsor.  These documents should, however, be 
retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulations or if requested by the 
Sponsor. The Investigator must contact the Sponsor and gain written approval prior to 
destroying any records.  No study documents will be destroyed or moved to a new location 
without prior written approval of the Sponsor.  If the Investigator relocates, retires, or 
withdraws from a clinical study for any reason, all records require d for the study should be 
transferred to an agreed -upon designee, e.g. another Investigator.  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 71 OF 78 19. CLINICAL STUDY ADMINI STRATION, ETHICS, AN D 
CONDUCT  
19.1. Good Clinical Practice  
GCP is an important ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, conducting, 
recording and reporting studies that involve the participation of human subjects.  Compliance 
with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety and well -being of study 
subjects are protected.  
19.2. Confidentiality  
19.2.1.  Study Confidentiality  
All info rmation regarding the nature of the investigation provided by the Sponsor or its 
designee to the Investigator  and his / her staff or designees (except for information required by 
law or regulations to be disclosed to the IRB, the subject, and/or the approp riate regulatory 
authorities) must be maintained in confidence by the Investigator  and his / her staff or 
designees.  
19.2.2.  Subject Anonymity  
The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained.  Subjects will be identified by 
their initials and subject nu mber on CRFs and other documents submitted to the Sponsor.  
Documents not submitted to the Sponsor include tho se that identify the subject (e .g., the signed 
ICF), and must be maintained in strict confidence by the Investigator, except as necessary to 
allow  auditing by the IRB, Sponsor or its designee, FDA, and/or equivalent authorities.  
19.3. Subject Information and Informed Consent  
Before being enrolled in the clinical study, subjects must consent to participate after the nature, 
scope , and possible consequences  of the clinical study have been explained in a form 
understandable to them.  
An informed consent document that includes information about the study will be prepared and 
given to the subject.  This document will contain all the elements required by the ICH E6 
Guideline for GCP and any additional elements required by local regulations.  The document 
must be in a language understandable to the subject and must specify who informed the subject.  
Where required by local law, the person who informs the subject mu st be a physician.  
All ICFs must contain the minimum elements as mandated by the FDA and ICH guidelines and 
will be subject to the Sponsor’s  (or designee’s)  approval as well as the IRB’s approval . 
The Investigator will not undertake any measures or procedu res specifically required of a 
subject for the clinical study until valid consent has been obtained.  
If an amendment to the protocol changes the subject participation schedule in scope or activity, 
or increases the potential risk to the subject, the ICF mu st be revised, submitted to the IRB for 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 72 OF 78 review and approval or favorable opinion.  The revised ICF must be used to obtain consent 
from a subject currently enrolled in the study only if he or she is affected by the amendment.  
The revised ICF must be used t o obtain consent from any new subjects who are enrolled into 
the study after the date of the approval or favo rable opinion of the amendment.  
19.4. Study Closure  
Completion or premature termination of the study will be reported by the Sponsor to the 
regulatory ag ency and by the Sponsor or by the Investigator to the IRB as required by local 
regulations or by the IRB.  
Once the database is locked, and all efforts are made to settle all outstanding queries, site 
closeout will occur.   Study materials (including used an d unused study drug) must be returned, 
disposed of , or retained, as directed by the Sponsor.  
19.5. Early Termination of the Clinical Trial  
If, in the opinion of an Investigator, the clinical observations in the study suggest that it may 
be unwise to continue, t hat Investigator may terminate their site’s participation after 
consultation with the Sponsor.  A written statement fully documenting the reasons for such a 
termi nation will be provided to the S ponsor.     
The Sponsor may terminate the study at any time fo r any reason.  
If it becomes apparent that subject enrollment at a particular site is unsatisfactory with respect 
to quality or quantity, or that data recording is inaccurate or incomplete on a chronic basis, the 
Sponsor has the right to terminate particip ation of that site and remove all study materials from 
that investigational site.  A written statement will be provided to the Investigator, the IRB , and 
regulatory authorities, if  required.  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 73 OF 78 20. INVESTIGATOR’S OBLIGA TIONS  
20.1. General  
The Investigator agrees that t he stud y will be conducted in accordance with  the clinical 
protocol, ICH-GCP  guidelines,  and the Decl aration of Helsinki.  The Investigator will conduct 
all aspects of this study in accordance with all governmental, state and local laws.  
20.2. Institutional Revie w Boa rd 
Before initiation of the study  at any site , the Investigator  must obtain approval of the clinical 
protocol and ICF from the IRB complying with the provisions specified in FDA CFR, Title 21, 
Part 56, ICH Guidelines, and all gove rnmental, state and l ocal laws.  
A copy of the written IRB approval of the protocol, ICF and any other documentation (such as 
advertising) as appropriate must be provided to the Sponsor or its designee prior to initiation 
of the study.  The approval letter must identify the IRB  name and address, the clinical protocol 
by title and/or protocol number, and the date approval was granted. Furthermore, the approval 
letter must contain a statement that the IRB complies with the FDA CFR, Title 21, Part 56, and 
ICH Guidelines for a study  conducted under an IND, or other applicable government 
regulations for studies not conducted under an IND.  
The Investigator is responsible for supplying the IRB with the data required for continued 
review of this study at intervals not exceeding one year,  or at intervals otherwise specified by 
the IRB.  The Investigator shall supply the Sponsor with written documentation of this 
continued review.  When necessary, an extension or renewal of the IRB approval must be 
obtained and this shall al so be forwarded to the Sponsor.  A list of the IRB members should be 
forwarded to the Sponsor in accordance with local regulations.  
The IRB and the regulatory authorities will be provided with any amendments for their review 
and/or approval.  A yearly status report on the progress of the study will be submitted by the 
Investigator to the IRB per their regulations.  
20.3. Investigator Protocol Adherence  
The Investigator and his/her designees are required to adhere to the protocol.    
In general, protocol deviations will not be grant ed. However, if a minor protocol deviation is 
necessary in order to eliminate an immediate hazard to a subject or to facilitate a subject’s 
adherence to protocol procedures , such a deviation request may be communicated to the Study 
Medical Monitor in writi ng for their consideration. Such a request should include a clear, 
complete, and compelling written description and justification.  A copy of this request and the 
written response of the Study Medical Monitor must also be placed in the appropriate file at 
the site.  
Emergency deviations  from the protocol that eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to a 
subject and that are deemed crucial for the safety and well -being of a particular subject may be 
instituted for that subject only.   If time allows, the Invest igator must consult with the Study 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL VDA -CP-05 P2B;  30A PRIL2018  PAGE 74 OF 78 Medical Monitor. If time does not allow, the Investigator may approve the deviation  without 
prior consultation with the Study Medical Monitor . The Investigator will contact the Sponsor 
as soon as possible  in the case of s uch a deviation .  These deviation s do not require pre -approval 
by the IRB; however, the Sponsor and the IRB must be notified in writing as soon as possible 
after the departure has been made.  In addition, the Investigator will document in the subject’s 
CRF  the reasons for protocol deviation and the ensuing events.  
20.4. Protocol Amendments  
Any additions or changes to the clinical protocol will require a protocol amendment. The 
Amended Clinical Protocol Signature Page will be signed by the protocol signatories.  Protocol 
amendments must undergo IRB approval prior to implementation.  Should the ICF require 
changes, the revised ICF must be approved also according to the same procedure.  
20.5. Audits and Inspections  
The Investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audi ts and inspections by the IRB, the 
Sponsor or its designee, government regulatory bodies, and quality assurance groups of all 
study -related documents.   This includes direct access to source documents, regulatory 
documents, data collection instruments, stud y data, etc.  The Investigator will ensure that al l 
study -related facilities (e .g., pharmacy, laboratories, etc.) are maintained in accordance with 
GCP guidelines.  
Participation as an Investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by  
government regulatory authorities and applicable Sponsor (or designee) quality assurance 
personnel .

22.1. Local Skin Reaction Score  
The Local Skin Reaction Score is an assessment of the skin in the Treatment Field. At each 
study visit the Investigator (or designee) will assign a severity score to each of the objective 
findings listed in the table . Whenever possible, the same investigator should perform all 
the LSR assessments.  
The Investigator will assess the selected Treatment Field and rate the findings on a 5 -point 
scale (0 -4). The composite LSR score will consist of the sum of all the individ ual LSR scores.

 SCHEMA  
 
Abbreviated Title  MK-3475 For the Treatment Of Relapsed/Refractory 
Mycosis Fungoides/Sézary Syndrome (MF/SS)  
Trial Phase  Phase II  
Clinical Indication  Stage IB-IVB MF/SS, and who have relapsed, are refractory, 
or progressed after at least one standard systemic therapy  
Trial Type  Nonrandomized, open -label, phase II, interventional study  
Type of  control  None  
Route of administration  Intravenous  (IV) 
Trial Blinding  None  
Treatment Groups  The dose level of MK -3475 proposed to be tested in this 
study will be 2 mg/kg administered by IV infusion q3w 
(21 [± 3] days). Treatment cycles will be 21 days with the 
first clinical response assessment  at week 12 (after 4  doses 
of MK -3475 have been administered during week 1, 4, 7 and 
10). If progression is seen at week 12  a confirmat ory 
assessment  will be performed at week 16.  If progression is 
confirmed at week 16 or beyond, patients may continue to receive MK -3475 therapy if otherwise clinically stable.  If 
no progression is seen at week 12, the next assessment will be at week 18 , then every 2 cycles (every 6 weeks) through 
week #30. (Assessments will be performed at weeks 24 and 
30). After week #30 study assessments will be reduced to every 4 cycles (every 12 weeks)  and will be performed at 
weeks 42, 54, 66, 78, 90 and 104 (end of study). Not all MF/SS patients have disease that is measurable by computed tomography ( CT) scan so the term “ assessment ” refers to the 
Olsen global assessments which include composite assessment s of skin ( assessed by mSWAT), lymph nodes 
(assessed by CT), viscera (by CT) and blood tumor burden 
of circu lating Sézary cells  (CSCs) via flow cytometry . At 
each assessment time point patients will receive CT scans (if they have measurable disease), mSWAT and flow cytometry for CSCs.  Subjects with CR after receiving a minimum of 6 
months of treatment with at le ast 2 doses since CR may 
discontinue therapy. Subjects with a CR who progress may be retreated if (1) no cancer treatment was administered since the last dose of MK -3475, (2) subject continues to 
meet eligibility criteria, and  (3) the trial is open. Subjects 
without confirmed progression of disease may receive up to a maximum of 2 years of therapy.

 Number of trial subjects  In this Phase II t rial, 9  subjects wi ll be enrolled in Stage 1 
and 15 subjects may be enrolled in Stage 2. In total a 
maximum of 24  subjects will be enrolled.  
Estimated duration of trial  In this Phase II trial Stage 1 will enroll over 5 -10 months, 
and Stage 2 will enroll over 10 -20 months. In total the trial 
will be enrolled over 15- 30 months. 
Duration of Par ticipation  First assessment of primary endpoint of clinical response at 
week 12. I f progression, confirmatory assessment  at week 
16. If  no progression, next assessment at week 18 and then 
every 6 weeks (every 2 cycles) through week #30.  Assessments after week 30 will be every 4 cycles (every 12 weeks) including weeks 42, 54, 66, 78, 90 and 104 (end of study).  Subjects are followed for overall response, progression free survival, duration of response, and overall survival . Immune response assays will be performed pre -
study, following cycle 1 (on the first day of cycle #2) and then upon the first day of every 3
rd cycle thereafter including 
cycles 5,8,11, etc.    
 
SCHEMA (Continued)  
CITN, multi -institution, non-randomized, open-label, phase II study of systemic intravenous 
infusion of MK-3475 in relapsed/refractory MF/SS. Simon’s Optimal Two -Stage Design: 
Stage 1 will enroll 9 patients.  Stage 2:   Will enroll an additional 15 patients (for a total of 
24).  If there are one or more responses (PR or CR) amo ngst the nine patients enrolled in Stage 1, 
Stage 2 enrollment will proceed.   If there are no responses (PR or CR) amongst the nine patients 
enrolled in Stage 1, enrollment into Stage 2 will not proceed.  The null hypothesis (H0) MK-
3475 will show less than 5% overall response rate.  The alternative hypothesis (H1) MK -3475 
will show greater than 25% overall response rate (PR and CR).

•Tx - MK-3475 will be 2 mg/kg administered by IV infusion q3w (21 [± 
3] days). Treatment cycles will be 21 days with first clinical response 
assessment at week 12, then again at either week 16 or 18, then after every 
2 cycles (every 6 weeks) through week 30, then every 4 cycles (every 12 
weeks) with treatment continued until  confirmed progression by repeat 
assessment at least 4 weeks later .  If progression is confirmed at week 16 
or beyond, patients may continue to receive MK -3475 therapy if othe rwise 
clinically stable.  Subjects with  CR after receiving a minimum of six 
months of treatment with at least two doses since CR may discontinue 
therapy . Subjects with a CR who progress may be retreated if (1) no cancer 
treatment was administered since the  last dose of MK-3475, (2) subject 
continues to meet eligibility criteria, and (3) the trial is open. Subjects may 
receive up to a maximum of 2 ye ars of therapy if clinically improving or 
stable  (Section 5.4). 
•Assessment –  
oClinical response – At week 12, then at either week 16 or 18 , then every 
6 weeks to week #30, then every 12 weeks thereafter.  
oImmune response – following cycle 1 and upon completion of every 3rd 
cycle. and at time of confirmed CR, PR, PD or EOT visit With regard to efficacy/clinical 
response,  in order to determine the 
sample size, we use an optimal 2 -stage 
design since it minimizes the expected 
sample size given a poor response 
rate. The null hypothesis is set at 5% 
(p0 0.05), the alternative hypothesis is 25% (p1 0. 25) and the desired 
significance level (α) and desired power (β) are 0.1 and 0.9, respectively. The total number of 
subjects for the trial will be 24 
subjects, whereas 9 subjects will be accrued during stage 1 and 15 subjects 
accrued during stage 2. Howeve r, if 
no responses (CR or PR) are observed 
during the first stage, then further 
enrollment will be suspended.  
Patients currently on study who qualify will continue to be treated and 
followed.   
 
 
Stage 2  
N=15  
•Tx - MK-3475 will be 2 mg/kg administered by IV infusion q3w (21 [±  
3] days). Treatment cycles will be 21 days with first clinical response 
assessment at week 12, then again at either week 16 or week 18, then 
every 2 cycles to week #30, then every 4 cycles (every 12 weeks) with 
treatment continued until  confirmed progression by repeat assessment at 
least 4 weeks later .  If progression is confirmed at week 16 or beyond, 
patients may continue to receive MK -3475 therapy if otherwise 
clinically stable. Subjects with CR after receiving a minimum of six 
months of treatment with at least two doses since CR may discontinue 
therapy . Subjects with a CR w ho progress may be retreated if (1) no 
cancer treatment was administered since the last dose of MK -3475, (2) 
subject continues to meet eligibility criteria, and (3) the trial is open. 
Subjects may receive up  to a maxim um of 2 years of therapy if clinically  
improving or stabl e.

oImmune response – following cycle 1 and upon completion of every 
3rd cycle. and at time of con firmed CR, PR, PD or EOT visit  
 Final Assessment:  
With regard to efficacy/clinical 
response,  in order to determine the 
sample size, we used an optimal 2 -
stage design since it minimizes the expected sample size given a poor 
response rate. The null hypothesis is 
set at 5% (p0 0.05), the alternative hypothesis is 25% (p1 0 .25) and the 
desired significance level (α) and desired power (β) are 0.1 and 0.9, respectively. The total number of 
subjects for the trial will be 24 
subjects, 15 subjects will be accrued during stage 2. However, if 3 or more 
responses (CR or PR) are obse rved 
during the first and second stage 
combined, the trial will be considered 
a success

101.OBJECTIVES  
Primary Objectives  
To assess the response rate of MK -3475 in subjects with relapsed/refractory mycosis 
fungoides/Sézary syndrome ( MF/SS). 
Hypothesis:  Administration of MK -3475 to subjects with relapsed/refractory MF and SS will 
result in a clinically meaningful objective response rate.  
Secondary Objectives
To explore the clinical activity of MK -3475 in subjects with relapsed/refractory MF and SS with 
respect to the following endpoints:  
• Duration of response (DOR)  
• Progression- free survival (PFS)  
• Overall survival (OS)  
Hypothesis:  Induction of a meaningful objective response rate with MK-3475 will be reflected 
in other clinical outcome parameters including DOR , PFS, and OS . 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
Relapsed/Refractory Mycosis Fungoides/Sézary Syndrome
Mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome is the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma 
(CTCL), a subset of mature non-Hodgkin lymphoma. MF exhibits an epidermotropic clonal expansion of cluster of differentiation 4 –positive ( CD4
+) T helper cells that induc es pleomorphic 
skin lesions. MF may present gradually over many years as an indolent, chronic skin disease or present with more rapidly advancing skin disease, especially in those with worse prognostic factors such as folliculotropism or large cell transfo rmation. SS is a leukemic variant of CTCL in 
which subjects have generalized erythroderma and are at risk for lymph node and visceral disease. MF/SS comprise the most common CTCLs, with continued increase in overall 
annual incidence  (currently approximately 0.9 per 100,000 persons in the United States) [ Hoppe 
1995] . There is a 2:1 ma le to female prevalence and peak age of presentation is 55 to 60 years. It 
is rarely seen in the pediatric age group (i.e. , diagnosis at age <18 years of age). The cutaneous 
manifestations of MF are heterogeneous  [Horwitz 2008] . 
Therapeutic options for MF and SS are primarily determined by the patient ’s clinical stage. The 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has recently published consensus guidelines for stage- based treatment of MF/SS  [NCCN] . The first -line treatment of early stage MF (IA, IB, 
and IIA) are skin-directed therapies including phototherapy, topical medications (corticosteroids, chemotherapeutic agents, and retinoids), and radiation therapy. 
At more advanced stages (i.e. , IIB and higher), systemic therapies are often utilized. These 
include bexarotene, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Admini stration (FDA) based on 
improved response rates, vorinostat, interferons, extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), denileukin

 diftitox, radiation therapy, traditional chemotherapeutic agents (methotrexate, doxorubicin, 
gemcitabine, and chlorambucil), and investigational agents. Despite a wide array of available therapeutic options, subjects with MF and SS remain largely incurable. Response rates for most 
of these systemic agents are 30 -40% with infrequent complete responses  (CR) ; these 
clinical responses are often short -lived  with most approved agents yielding median DORs in 
the range of 6-12 months [Duvic 2001];  [Olsen 2001] ; [Olsen 2 007]; [Whittaker 2010]
.  
The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformation has been known for decades [Disis 2010]
. Accumulating evidence shows a 
correlation between tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable 
prognosis in various malignancies [Dong 2002]; [Sharpe 2002] ; [Brown 2003] ; [Thompson 
2007];  [Francisco 2010].  In particular, the pres ence of CD8+ T cells and the ratio of CD8+ 
effector T  cells/FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) seems to correlate with improved prognosis 
and long-term survival in many solid tumors. 
There is mounting evidence that T cell immunity may be responsible for cli nical antitumor 
activity in MF/SS: 
2.1.1 Tumor-infiltrating T cells are prognostic of survival. 
a. Hoppe et al. identified improved survival in MF subjects whose biopsies demonstrated CD8
+ TILs, even when controlling for stage [Hoppe 1995] . 
2.1.2 Therapies which augment T cell function are effective in MF/SS. 
a. Interferon alpha has been shown in a number of studies to be a highly active agent in CTCL with overall response rates (ORRs) ranging from 40% to 80% with concurrent improvement i n T cell cytotoxicity [Bunn 1986];  [Olsen 1995
]. 
b. Interferon gamma has been used as a monotherapy in 16 patients with refractory disease, with an ORR of 30% and DOR of 10 months and concurrent augmented T-cell activity [Kaplan 1990]
. 
c. Early studies with high -dose interleukin 2 ( IL-2) demonstrated activity in relapsed 
CTCL but with significant toxicity [Heald 1992] ; [Heald  1990] . 
d. IL-12 has also demonstrated activity in relapsed CTCL. In phase I and II studies, 
nearly half of the 32 evaluable patients achieved a response, and toxicities included myalgias, fatigue, and chills [ Rook 2002]; [Rook 2001].
 
e. ECP is an immunomodulatory apheresis-based therapy that works directly on both subsets of T cells and on the precursors of maturing dendritic cells [Heald 1992
]; 
[Heald 1990];  [Zic 1992]; [Prinz 1995];  [Owsianowski 1996];  [Di Renzo 1997]  
[Miracco 1997 ]; [Jiang  1999] . 
f. Other immunotherapy agents have been combined with photophoresis including retinoids, interferons, and cytokine growth factors. 
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date:  March 8 , 2018 
12i. Richardson and colleagues have reported high response rates in patients with the 
SS when ECP therapy was administration with immune adjuvant therapies, including interferon alpha (INF -α) and bexarotene [Rook 2002].  
g. A modification of ECP known as transimmunization may improve tumor- targeted 
response.  
i. Transimmunization involves co- incubating the a poptotic malignant T cells and 
the newly formed dendritic cells prior to reinfusion in order to optimize antigen processing and stimulate a more efficient induction of tumor-targeted immunity. The goal of treatment is to transfer the disease- associated antigens to antigen -
presenting dendritic cells, thus initiating immunization against these antigens [Girardi 2002 ], [Girardi 2002], [Berger 2002], [Edelson 2001 ]. 
h.In a phase I study of 28 patients with recurrent or advanced CTCL who received 
CPG7909, the Toll- like receptor 9 (TLR9)  agonist, in weekly subcutaneous doses of 
0.08, 0.16, 0.24, or 0.28 mg/kg for 24 weeks, the ORR was 25% [Kim 2004]. Five 
patients (18%) achieved partial response ( PR) and 2 (7%) achieved CR. Kim reported 
clinical responses in 5/15 subjects in an in -situ vaccination trial in which CPG (a 
TLR9 agonist) was combined with loca l radiation therapy [Kim 2012]  validating the 
potential of T -cell responses and the likelihood of existent nascent T -cell responses.  
i. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is superior to autologous. Allogeneic SCT 
in MF/SS d emonstrates improved overall and event- free survival than autologous 
SCT recipients, possibly due to a graft versus lymphoma effect [Wu 2009], validating 
that T -cell responses can potentially eradicate the disease.

CTEP  IND Agent : MK -3475 
2.2.1 MK-3475 
 
MK-3475 (SCH 900475) is a humanized immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) which binds the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor, thus inhibiting the interaction with its ligands, PD -L1 or PD -L2 (Investigator’ s Brochure, 2014).  PD-1 is an 
immune -checkpoint receptor expressed by T cells.  When bound to either PD- L1 or PD -
L2, the PD-1 pathway negatively regulates T- cell effector functions.  The PD -1 pathway 
functions to limit unwanted or excessive immune respons es, including autoimmune 
reactions.  PD-L1 is typically expressed at low levels on various non-hematopoietic tissues, and PD -L2 is only detectably expressed on antigen- presenting cells in the 
lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.   
PD-L1 is also expressed in the tumor microenvironment of various cancers (Zou and 
Chen, 2008).  Activation of the PD- 1 pathway may be a critical mechanism to evade T -
cell mediated tumor rejection (Dong et al. , 2002 ; Pardoll, 2012).  High levels of PD- L1

 expression are correlated with poor prognosis and survival in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 
(Thompson et al., 2007) , pancreatic carcinoma (Nom i et al. , 2007),  hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) (Gao et al. , 2009),  and ovarian carcinoma (Hamanishi  et al. , 2007).   
 Immune -checkpoint inhibition of another inhibitory T- cell receptor, cytotoxic T -
lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), with the mAb ipilimumab demonstrated significant prolongation of overall survival (OS) in patients with melanoma in two phase 3 trials  (Hodi  et al. , 2010 ; Robert  et al. , 2011; Ribas, 2012
).  As an immunotherapy 
target, PD -1 is distinct from CTLA -4 because it can be activated directly by the cancer 
and it regulates the effector phase of T -cell response, whereas CTLA -4 regulates the 
initial stage of T -cell activation ( Pardoll, 2012; Ribas, 2012 ).  Antibodies targeting the 
PD-1 pathway have demonstrated durable objective responses in phase 1 and 2 trials.  
Nivolumab showed an overall response rate (ORR) of approximately 28% in subjects with advanced melanoma, 27% in subjects with RCC, and 18% in subjects with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had failed prio r therapy 
(Topalian et al. , 2012) .  
MK-3475 has shown an ORR of approximately 38% in patients with melanoma (Hamid  
et al. , 2013)  and ~20% in patients with NSCLC (Investigator’s Brochure, 2014).  
 2.2.1.1 Clinical Development of MK -3475 
 
Clinical data are derived from an ongoing, first-in human phase 1 study (PN001, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of MK-3475 as a monotherapy, sponsored by Merck Sharp & Dohme.  There are five parts to this study (Parts A -D and F) ( Investigator’s Brochure, 2014). 
  
 
Part A  was a 3+3 dose-escalation study in subjects with solid tumors to eval uate safety, 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics, and to determine a 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or preliminary recommended phase 2 doses (RP2Ds).  Doses were 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W); doses of either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/k g were also administered every 3 weeks (Q3W).  All 3 dose levels were well 
tolerated and no dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed; therefore, the MTD was 
not determined.  The RP2D was determined by the sponsor based on safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic measurements, along with the strength of antitumor activity signals observed. 
 The remaining four parts aim to characterize the safety profile and tolerability of MK -
3475 and to evaluate the clinical activity of MK-3475 in the following patient populations:   
Part B : Advanced melanoma patients who have either received prior ipilimumab (IPI-
treated) or were naïve to prior ipilimumab (IPI- naïve).  Patients in Part B receive MK -
3475 at three dose levels: 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W, and 10 mg/kg Q2W.   
 
Part C : NSCLC patients.  Patients in Part C receive MK -3475 at 10 mg/kg Q3W.   
 
Part D : Advanced melanoma patients that are IPI -naïve.  Patients in Part D receive MK -
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date:  March 8 , 2018 
14 
 3475 at 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W.  
 
Part F : NSCLC patients with and without prior systemic therapy whose tumors express 
PD-L1 when exposed to MK- 3475.  Patients in Part F receive MK -3475 at 2 mg/kg or 10 
mg/kg Q3W, or 10 mg/kg Q2W.  
  Pharmacokinetics  
The half- life (t
1/2) of MK -3475 is approximately 4 weeks and there is no indication of 
dose dependency of half-life in the three dose groups (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg) (Investigator’s Brochure, 2014).  The long t
1/2 supports a dosing interval of every 2 or 3 weeks. 
 There was a dose- related increase in exp osure from 1 to 10 mg/kg 
(Investigator’s 
Brochure, 2014).  Serum concentrations of MK-3475 were lower by a factor of 
approximately 5 in patients receiving 2 mg/kg Q3W than in those receiving 10 mg/kg Q3W (
Hamid  et al. , 2013, Investigator’s Brochure, 2014 ).  Steady- state trough 
concentrations were 20% greater in the patients receiving 10 mg/kg Q2W than in those receiving the same dose Q3W.  
 Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) Data 
The occurrence of ADA has been observed in less than 1% of the patients screened, indicating a low potential of MK-3475 to elicit the formation of ADA 
(Investigator’s 
Brochure, 2014).  No i mpact of ADA on MK-3475 exposure has been observed. 
  Efficacy  
When treated with MK -3475 monotherapy, the ORR for IPI- treated patients with 
melanoma (Part B) was 25%/27% according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)/investigator- assessed immune -related response criteria (irRC), 
respectively (Investigator’s Brochure, 2014). 
 The ORR for IPI -naïve patients with 
melanoma (Parts B and D) was 39%/43% by RECIST/investigator- assessed irRC, 
respective ly.  The majority of responses were seen in patients with melanoma by 16 
weeks of therapy with MK-3475; however, some responses have been reported after 24 weeks or more of therapy with MK -3475.  Responses can be delayed, and in some 
patients, a RECIST -defined progression followed by a response has been observed. 
 The preliminary objective response rate for 38 patients with NSCLC (Part C) was 21%/24% by RECIST/investigator -assessed irRC, respectively 
(Investigator’s B rochure, 
2014) .   
 Pharmacodynamics/Biomarkers  
PD-L1 is being investigated as a predictive biomarker for MK -3475 treatment.  At the 
15
th World Conference on Lung Cancer, Garon et al.  presented preliminary data on a 
subset of patients suggesting that highe r levels of tumor PD -L1 expression are associated 
with increased clinical activity  (Garon et al ., 2013).  Objective responses by RECIST 1.1 
occurred in 4 out of 7 patients with higher levels of PD -L1 expression (57%, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 18 -90%) vs. 2 out of 22 patients with lower levels of PD- L1 
expression (9%, 95% CI 1-29%).  These data are extremely preliminary, and PD -L1 is 
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date:  March 8 , 2018 
15not being used for patient selection.   
Biomarkers to evaluate immune modulation and markers in the tumor microenvironment, 
such as T -cell infiltration, the baseline expression of markers of T -cell suppression FoxP3 
or the immunoregulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in tumor biopsies, were associated with a high response rate ( Berman et al. , 2009; Hamid et al. , 2009).  
2.2.1.2 Safety data   
The most frequent treatment- related adverse events (AEs) were fatigue, nausea, cough, 
pruritus, diarrhea, and rash (Investigator’s Brochure, 2014).  Most AEs were not 
considered serious.  The most commonly reported immune- related AEs were rash, 
pruritus, vitiligo, hypothyroidism, arthralgia, diarrhea, and pneumonitis. 
Important id entified risks include: pneumonitis, thyroid disorders (hypothyroidism and 
hyperthyroidism), colitis, diarrhea, hepatitis, nephritis, uveitis, rash/pruritus and 
neuropathy.
Rationale 
Recent evidence of expression of PD -1 and PD-L1 in MF/SS has uncovered an additional 
mechanism of potential immune escape and a new therapeutic target. Current data suggest that the PD -1/PD -L1 may play a significant role in preventing immune-driven eradication of MF/SS 
tumor population. A 2012 study evaluated the expression of PD -1 and PD-L1 in various 
morphological subsets of MF ranging from patch/plaque to tumor stage with or without large cell transformation [Kantekure 2012]  (Figure 2.3.1).  
Figure 2.3.1 PD-1/PD -L1 Expression in CTCL/MF

 (middle row), and large cell transformation (lower row). The formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded 
(FFPE) skin biopsy tissue sections were stained with H&E (left column) or antibodies against 
PD-1 (middle column) or PD-L1 (right column). The depicted images are representative of the 
26 CTCL cases examined and were captured at the 4003 magnification. The blue arrows in the PD-1 stain of the large cell transformation case highl ight the negative large lymphocytes). 
A 2012 study evaluated the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in various morphological subsets of MF ranging from patch/plaque to tumor stage with or without large cell transformation [Kantekure 2012]
. In this study, 9/9 patch/plaque and 5/6 tumor lesions showed >2% PD-1 
expression of atypical lymphocytes via immunohistochemistry. In comparison, large transformed lymphocytes showed reduced expression of PD-1, with only 2/11 demonstrating >2% expression. On the other hand, PD-L1 expression was quite strong across all subsets, with 7/9 patch/plaque, 6/6 tumor stage, and 11/11 large transformed lymphocytes demonstrating >50% expression. In the 2/9 patch/plaque lesions with less than 50% PD- L1 expressi on, the 
staining was still greater than 2%.  
Figure 2.3.2  PD-1 Expression  Figure 2.3.3 Blocking PD -1 Increases INF -γ 
  
 
[Samimi  2010] ; and [Rook 2002]  also demonstrated higher expression of PD-1 and PD -L1 via 
flow cytometry on peripheral blood T cells in S S subjects [Samimi 2010]  (See Figure 2.3.2. 
Increased expression of PD -1 on CD4+ T cells from patients with SS. The peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients  with SS (n=7), patients with MF (n=4), and healthy 
donors (n=4) were stained with anti-CD4, anti- PD-1, and anti-CD26, and were analyzed by flow 
cytometry. The percentage of CD4+PD-1+ is demonstrated according to patient population and 
CD26 status. Error bars indicate the standard deviation of uncertainty.) 
When blocking PD-1 and PD- L1 in vitro, interferon -γ (IFN -γ) production increased, perhaps 
indicating recovery of T- cell function after withdrawing the suppressive PD -1/PD -L1 signal 
(Figure 2.3.3.) Blocking the pathway of PD-1 and its ligand PD- L1 results in increased IFN -γ 
production by patients’ PBMCs stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28. The PBMCs of patients with 
SS were cultured for 72 hours with either medium or anti-CD3/CD28 alone, and with the following: murine IgG (mIgG), anti- PD-1, or anti- PD-L1. Subsequently, culture supernatants 
were collected and tested for the presence of IFN -γ. Furthermore, PD-1 expression levels, along 
with the overall proportion of the malignant T- cell population, decreased as a S S patient 
improved clinically during treatment. Preliminary data supports the induction of PD-L1 by standard therapies in MF/SS including radiation, epigenetic therapies, and interferon. 
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10

 Collectively, these data suggest that PD -1 and PD- L1 are expressed ab errantly on the malignant 
tumor cells of MF/SS, further augmented by current therapies, and that blockage of these signals 
may lead to reduced antitumor T-cell inhibition and thus tumor eradication. 
Recent data of BMS -936558 have validated PD- 1 as an attra ctive target for clinical intervention 
and have provided proof of concept for anti- PD-1 mAbs in melanoma and renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC) [Sznol 2010].  BMS -936558 has shown an ORR of approximately 30% in patients with 
advanced melano ma and RCC who had failed prior therapy [Sznol 2010 ]. In addition, ORR of 
near 20% was observed in patients with NSCLC [Brahmer 2012] ; [Sznol 2010].  Importantly, 
responses were of  long duration, and BMS-936558 was generally well tolerated. The repeat dose 
study tested multiple dose levels (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) [Sznol 2010 ]; 
[Robert 2011] . Importantly, as MF/S S appears to express a high level of PD -L1, the ability of 
PD-L1 to predict response to PD-1 targeted therapy is of relevance. In mixed tumor types 
including melanoma and NSCLC, among others, this observation has been reported and 
validated. In 3 recent reports, response rates among PD -L1–positive patients are 42%, 41%, and 
34%, compared to 0%, 14%, and 16% among PD- L1–negative patients [Topalian 2012]. 
Additional biomarker analysis to predict response to PD-1 targeted therapies, demonstrated that patients with a history of or present tobacco use and thus a higher rate and number of mutations in NSCLC respond more frequently, 26%, than those without a tobacco history (10%) . As 
MF/SS is considered a highly immunogenic and PD- L1–expressing tumor, it is likely to be 
responsive to PD-1 targeted therapy.

 Finally, 2 recent cases of MF/SS enrolled on the MPDL3280A clinical trial of an IgG1 engineered mAb against PD-L1 both of whom obtained PRs support further testing of PD-1 targeted agents in this disease [Kohrt ASCO 2013]. The first patient was a 65 -year-old man w ith 
Stage IB multiply relapsed MF (h istory of phototherapy: PUVA, bexarotene, anti- CD4 mAb,

 forodesine, CpG and radiation, lenalidomide, sapacitabine, enzastaurin, and total skin electron 
beam therapy) who obtained a PR at first assessment (following 2 cycles) and has maintained a deep PR following 16 cycles (1 year) of treatment. ( See Figure 2.3.4. Lesion on right forearm 
pretreatment [top left] and following 8 cycles of therapy [ top right ]. Lesion on right upper thigh 
pretreatment [bottom left] and following 8 cycles of therapy [bottom right] ). The second case 
was a 58 -year-old woman with Stage IIIB multiply relapsed MF (history of photochemotherapy: 
PUVA + bexarotene, CpG and radiation, vorinostat, forodesine, bexarotene, sapacitabine, lenalidomide, enzastaurin, low-dose total skin electron beam therapy) who obtained a PR after 2 cycles of therapy with a reduction in Modified Severity- Weighted Assessment Tool (m SWAT ) 
score (which scores extent and burden of disease in MF) from 90 at baseline to 42. Following 7 cycles of therapy, anti- PD-L1 was discontinued due to patient-reported profound fatigue and her 
disease progressed thereafter ( See Figure 2.3.5. Lesion on right foot consistent with 
erythroderma prior to therapy [top left] and on day 1 of cycle 3 [top right] . mSWAT score over 
the course of treatment on clinical trial MPDL3280A [bottom] ). 
The primary endpoint of this current study (CITN -10) is clinical response. This endpoint will 
first be evaluated  by clinical response ( global) assessment per [Olsen
] at week 12 (after 4  doses 
of MK -3475 during week 1, 4,7 and 10).  If progres sive disease (PD ) is seen at week 12 , a 
confirmatory assessment  will be  performed at week 16. If no progressi on is seen at week 12 , 
subjects will be assessed again at week 18 . After this , subjects will be assessed  every 2 cycles 
(every 6 weeks)  through week #30, then every 4 cycles (every 12 weeks)  thereafter with the best 
response being assessed based on specific criteria relevant to the histologies of MF/SS : 
1) Consensus response criteria in MF/SS [Olsen 2011]  
2) Compartmental assessments of skin, blood, lymph nodes, and viscera, as appropriate (Olsen response criteria , see Protocol Section 11
)) 
3) Global response will be determined from compartmental response, to determine ORR (Protocol Section 11
) 
 
If progression is determined at week 16 or beyond, patients will be eligible to receive continued MK-3475 if they are clinically stable as defined by the following criteria.  (The maximum 
duration of therapy in this setting is the same as for other patients, 2 years).    
• Absence of signs and symptoms indicating disease progression 
• Absence of rapid progression of disease 
• Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (e.g., cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention 
 The following assessment and stopping criteria apply to patients who continue MK-3475 beyond progression: 
• Patients who continue therapy after progression will have mSWAT performed with every 
cycle (every 3 weeks) and a full Olsen Criteria assessment including mSWAT, CT scans, 
for those with measurable disease, and CSC, if positive for Sézary cells, every 4 cycles (every 12 weeks).  At the discretion of the investigator these assessments may be repeated more frequently. 
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date:  March 8 , 2018 
19• Study drug will be discontinued if any compartment increases in value by 25% or more 
over the new baseline including mSWAT score, measurable disease by CT scan, or Circulating Sezary Cell Counts.  The new baseline being defined as the assessments 
obtained at the confirmation of progression.       
Patients being treated with MK -3475 for melanoma have experienced late responses with 
continued therapy.  In the KEYNOTE-001 melanoma trial using MK-3475 there was an 
additional 3.6% response rate with continued therapy.  This category of response in that trial was defined as an “unconventional response” with “delayed ps eudoprogression: ≥25% increase in 
tumor burden at any assessment after week 12 that was not confirmed as progressive disease per irRC at the next assessment”. [ Hodi, 2014].  
Subjects will be assessed using the modified SWAT  (mSWAT or modified skin weighted 
assessment tool) [see Appendix  E] to capture percent body surface involvement with patches, 
plaques, or tumors. Patches will be multiplied × 1, plaques × 2, and tumors or nodules × 4. Full -
body and half -body photographs  will b e taken at baseline, at each on -study evaluation visit, 
and at the end of treatment vi sit.  Refer to Appendix C for full instructions. Radiographic 
imaging will be required with a full-body positron emission tomography( PET)/computed 
tomography ( CT) with co ntrast performed prior to study entry and scored by Olsen criteria. 
Subjects without extracutaneous disease at screening  (those with nonmeasureable disease by CT) 
will have repea t imaging at the discretion of the investigator for PD . Repeat imaging is not 
necessary for CR, PR , or stable disease ( SD) in those patients with nonmeasurable disease. For 
subjects with known extracutaneous disease (those with measurable disease by CT) , imaging wil l 
be performed at week 12 (after 4  doses of MK-3475). If  progression is seen at week 12 , a 
confirmatory scan will be  repeated at w eek 16. If no  progression is seen at week 12, imag ing will 
be repeated at week 18  then every 6 weeks (every 2 cycles)  through week #30, then every  4 
cycles (every 12 weeks) . At t ime of CR/PR con firmation or PD and end of therapy (EOT ), an 
imaging study will be performed. 
Immunotherapeutic agents such as MK -3475 may produce antitumor effects by potentiating 
endogenous cancer -specific immune responses, which may be functionally anergic. The respons e 
patterns seen with such an approach may extend beyond the typical time course of responses 
seen with cytotoxic agents and can manifest a clinical response after an initial increase in tumor burden or even the appearance of new lesions. Standard RECIST criteria may not provide a complete response assessment of immunotherapeutic agents such as MK -3475. 
Correlative Studies Background  
Cancer treatment has evolved significantly since the original introduction of nitrogen mustard during World War II for subjects with lymphoma [Alexander 2011] . Today mAbs  are the 
standard of care for multiple tumor histologies [Dalle 2008] , a dendritic cell vaccine is approved 
by the FDA for the treatment of hormone- resistan t prostate cancer [Kantoff 2010] , and an 
immunomodulating mAb is approved for melanoma [Hodi 2010] , [Mellman 2011] , [Topalian 
2011].  This evolving field of immunotherapy provides the potential to eliminate cytotoxic, 
conventional chemotherapy, which results in significant toxicity to normal tissue in an effort to increase its antitumor efficacy. Uniquely, immunotherapy to date is well- tolerated or

 demonstrates predictable toxicity as a result of immunostimulation, such as the autoimmune AE s 
due to anti-CTLA4 or anti- PD-1 therapy [Attia 2005] ; [Hodi 2010] . The drug development 
pipeline of both academic and pharmaceutical efforts appear s rich in novel immunotherapeutics, 
suggesting that the field of immunotherapy is likely to be a mainstay of future cancer treatment. 
In contrast to the evolution of alkylating agents, topoisomerase inhibitors, and other conventional chemotherapies, the development of immunotherapy necessitates multiple shifts in the paradigm of cancer drug development. Development of new criteria to assess response to immunomodulating therapies is exemplary of the immunotherapy- specific shift [
Alexander 
2011] . This transition in response evaluation, though led by a single institution, is now 
implemented near-universally across U.S. and European institutions evaluating activity of immunotherapies. Similarly at the larger cooperative group and societal levels, efforts are ongoing to harmonize immune monitoring and immunologic biomarkers 
[Britten 2008 ]; [van der 
Burg 2011] . Despite immu ne-specific clinical trial monitoring, biomarkers, and response 
assessment, immunotherapy trials, to date, have yet to properly define immune-specific inclusion criteria. Defining which patient cohorts are responsive to immunotherapy or, more easily, exclu ding enrollment of subjects who have no likelihood of response based on an incompetent 
immune system will be of substantial significance to the field by ( a) increasing the efficiency of 
immunotherapy trials, ( b) reducing the needed sample size of early phase proof -of-concept 
studies, and (c) reducing the cost of clinical development by approximately 35%. The impact of this in -depth analysis of immune competency in cancer will provide mechanistic insight into the 
tumor-immune interactions, uncover biomarkers of response to therapy and patient prognosis, and ultimately aid in discovery of novel immunotherapeutics that improve patient survival while 
maintaining quality of life. 
Anti-PD-1 therapy, as an immunotherapy, unlike conventional modalities of cancer treatment, 
targets and modulate the patient’s immune system. Tumor- immune interactions occur at the level 
of the tumor microenvironment, including TILs and systemic macroenvironment , including 
circulating lymphocytes that may be recruited to the tumor. The state of a patient ’s immune 
system and its responsiveness to therapy influence the efficacy of immunotherapy. It is now well-established that tumor-induced immune suppression prevents the naturally protective 
antitumor immune response in subjects with cancer. The magnitude of immune suppression is heterogeneous dependent on disease histology, extent, duration, and prior therapies. Taken together, the efficacy of an immunotherapy is a balance that is dependent on the therapeutic and its ability to enhance an antitumor immune response and the patient’ s immune system , which 
may be variably suppressed by cancer. 
Current efforts to improve immunotherapy are focused on identifying and developing novel 
therapeutics. Due to the complexity, lack of in-depth methods, and limited incentive from a pharmaceutical perspective, little attention has been placed on thoroughly evaluating the immune competency of subjects with cancer. Unfortunately, therapeutics that appear highly promising, based on preclinical or early phase data, have failed in larger clinical application due, in part, to poor immune competency of the larger patient population [Houot 2009] ; [Alexander 2011]
; 
[Sznol 2012] . This leads to early abandoning of otherwise promising therapies. 
MF skin lesions are often readily accessible with minimally invasive skin biopsies. Thus, from an exploratory biomarker perspective, this disease offers an almost unique opportunity to investigate the determinants of response and resistance to anti -PD-1 therapy as well as to

 discover additional molecular targets governing immune dysregulation in cancer. We anticipate 
that these studies will yield candidate biomarkers that will correlate  with prognosis , have 
predictive value in the selection of which subjects benefit from anti- PD-1 mAb immunotherapy, 
and offer insight into new therapeutic approaches based on the mechanisms of immune suppression observed.  
Our exploratory biomarker approach will focus on blood (98 mL total volume) and tissue sampling performed at screening,  following cycle 1, and upon completion of every 3rd cycle as 
well as at time of confirmed CR, PR, PD , or EOT visit.  In order to reduce the number of patient 
visits , the biomarkers “following cycle 1” will be drawn on the first day of cycle 2, prior to study 
drug administration. Biomarkers will then be drawn on the first day of every 3
rd cycle thereafter 
including cycle 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, etc. 
Biomarker and c orrelative studies for the CITN- 10 trial will include the following:  
2.4.1 Chromogenic (Single -Color) Immunohistochemistry (IHC ) for PD -L1 
PD-L1 expression has been identified as a potential biomarker for response to anti -PD-1 
therapy. It is anticipated that FFPE samples will be sent to a  clinical research 
organi zation (CRO) for staining with our 22C3 anti- PD-L1 assay . We will test whether 
PD-L1 expression correlates with MK -3475 response in the MF/SS population. 
2.4.2 Multiparametric (Two -Color) IHC  
Spatial association of PD -1+ TILs and PD -L1+ cells (tumor and myeloid cells) suggests 
“induction” of PD -L1. I NF-γ production by antigen- specific PD -1+ CD8+ T cells is 
hypothesized to drive local intratumoral upregulation of PD-L1 on adjacent tumor and 
myeloid cells, leading to a “ stalled cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL )” response, which may 
be predictive of response to MK-3475 therapy. By assessing both of the required elements ( i.e., PD-L1 positive cells and PD -1
+ T cells ), a two -color IHC assay may be a 
better predictor of response than PD -L1 positivity  alone. Merck will perform this testing.  
Additional analytes may be assessed based upon funding. If so , an amendment to the 
protocol will be made.  
2.4.3 Transcriptional Analyses The Nanostring platform will be used to profile messenger RNA ( mRNA ) expression in 
archival biopsy material (and potentially PBMC material as well) to assess expression of 
over 650 genes and attempt to define a gene set critical for clinical response to MK-3475. The hypothesis to be tested is that MK-3475 responders will exhibit a “ stalled CTL ” 
response within the tumor reflected in the physical proximity between PD-1 and PD- L1 
expression and the presence of an aborted (e.g., weak but discernible) INF-γ 
transcriptional program. Global profiling by next-generation sequencing (RNAseq) will also be pursued. The nanostring testing will be performed by Merck.  
2.4.4 Immunophenotyping and  T cell function assays  
CyTOF and multiparametric flow cytomety will be employed to extensively immunophenotype circulating peripheral le ukocytes both prior to and during MK-3475 
treatment.  We anticipate that these studies will provide a more granular view of the 
tolerized PD -1
+ target cell and its response to anti -PD-1 blockade, which will guide the 
future choice of rational immunomodulatory combination therapies. I n addition, other

22 
 cell types (e.g. , Tregs and myeloid- derived cells with T cell suppressor function) and 
immunomodulatory molecules (e.g., IL -10) may be identified as additional components 
of the immunosuppressive milieu in MF/SS.  
Table 2.4: Immunophenoty pe Studies  
 
Immunophenotyping will be augmented by assays of T cell function. Activation of 
discrete T cell subsets and/or combinations of T cells with putative “suppressor cells” will be assayed by intracellular cytokines, cell surface activation markers of proliferation when challenged with autologous tumor cells or autologous dendritic cells pulsed with tumor lysate.  
2.4.5 Cytokine/Chemokine Analysis (serum enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay [ ELISA ]) 
Using a highly multiplexed ELISA-based platform, we w ill perform a longitudinal 
analysis of cytokines, chemokines, and other serum tumor-/oncogene- associated proteins 
at baseline (prior to treatment), on treatment, and at time of response assessment.  
2.4.6 Whole Exome Sequencing and Neoantigen Identification Genom ic studies of CTCL have revealed frequent alterations in T cell receptor signaling 
and CD28 co-stimulatory pathways as well as a translocation event involving PD-L1.  We propose to perform whole exome sequencing of paired germline/tumor DNA to determine whether these or other genomic alterations are associated with response to PD -
1 blockade.  Mutational burden and neoantigen burden have been found to correlate with response to immune checkpoint blockade in other malignancies.  Somatic mutations identified by whole exome sequencing will be analyzed for predicted formation of neoantigens. Subsequent individualized testing of immune responses directed against candidate neoantigens may be performed.  Depending on availability of resources, this may be limited to  a subset of patients.

233.PATIENT SELECTION 
Eligibility criteria  
3.1.1 This trial will include subjects with Stage IB -IVB MF/SS (maximal stage since diagnosis 
will determine eligibility), and who have relapsed, are refractory, or progressed after at 
least one standard systemic therapy.  Current disease stage at time of entry will also be documented but will not be used for eligibility.    
3.1.2 Subjects must have the following minimum washout and AE  recovery period from 
previous treatments without treatment between documentation of relapse/progression and enrollment of specifically:  
a. ≥2 weeks for local radiation therapy.  
b. ≥4 weeks for systemic cytotoxic anticancer agents, anticancer investigational agents 
that are not defined as immunotherapy, or for tumor- targeting  monoclonal antibodies 
(mAbs) with the exception of alemutuzumab for which the washout is at least 8 weeks.  
c. ≥15 weeks for anti -CD137 or anti -CTLA -4 (including ipilimumab or any other 
antibody or drug specifically targeting T- cell co -stimulation or checkpoint pathways).

g. ≥1 week for topical therapy (including retinoid, nitrogen mustard, or imiquimod). 
3.1.3 Be ≥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.  Because no dosing or adverse 
event data are currently available on the use of MK -3475 in patients <18 years of age, 
children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.  
3.1.4 Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) Performance Scale.  
3.1.5 Life expectancy of at least 6 months.

creatinine levels >1.5 X institutional 
ULN  
− International Normalized Ratio (INR) 
or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is  
receiving anticoagulant therapy in which case the INR or PT must be within the therapeutic range of intended use for the anticoagulant. 
 
− Activated Partial Thromboplastin 
Time (aPTT)  
   -    Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)  ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is 
receiving anticoagulant therapy in which case the aPTT must be within the therapeutic range of intended use for the anticoagulant. 
Within Institutional Limits (ie:  Normal).   If TSH is greater or less 
than institutional limits patients may participate if their T4 is WNL.  Patients may be on a stable dose of replacement thyroid medication.  Dose 
adjustments are allowed if needed.     
aCreatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional standard.  
 
3.1.7 Patients must provide tissue from a punch biopsy of the skin at baseline, at the time of a clinical event (at the time of response, progression or appearance of a new lesion) and at the end of treatment.  Additional punch biopsies every 3 cycles are optional.  An archival tissue sample is optional.  
 
3.1.8 Have measurable disease based on mSWAT (definition provided in Appendix E
). Tumor 
lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions. 
3.1.9 The effects of MK -3475 on the developing human fetus are unknown.  For this reason 
and because anti-PD-1agents may  be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and 
men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) from the time of the pre -study visit, through the course of the study 
and for 120 days after the last dose of study medication.     
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date:  March 8 , 2018 
25Female patients of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum 
pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. 
Female patients of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth 
control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity  from the time of the 
pre-study visit, through the course of the study and for 120 days after the last dose of study medication.  Patients of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for >1 year.  
Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.  Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of MK-3475   administration. 
3.1.10 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. 
 
Exclusion Criteria  
3.2.1 Patients who have had chemotherapy or targeted small molecule therapy  within 4 weeks 
(6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have 
not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.  
-Note:  Patients with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may 
qualify for the study. 
 
-Note:  If patients received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.  
3.2.2 Patients who are currently participating in or have par ticipated in a study of an 
investigational agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.  
3.2.3 Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving therapeutic systemic steroid therapy 
or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.   See section 5.3.1.1 for additional information on acceptable and 
prohibited concomitant medications.   
3.2.4 Has had a prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not 
recovered ( i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from AEs due to agents administered more than 
4 weeks earlier.  
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date:  March 8 , 2018 
26 
 3.2.5 Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.  
Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ  cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy.   
 3.2.6 Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because 
of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.   Patients with carcinomatous meningitis should also be excluded.   
Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable 
(without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of trial t reatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence 
of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment.   
3.2.7 History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of simi lar chemical or biologic 
composition to MK-3475.   
 3.2.8 Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that requires systemic steroids or imm unosuppressive agents.  Patients with vitiligo or 
resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule.  Patients that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be excluded from the study.  The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the  Protocol PI and CITN.  Patients with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjogren’s syndrome  will not be excluded from the study. 
 3.2.9 Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient’s participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.  
 3.2.10 Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.  
 3.2.11 Has received prior therapy with an anti- PD-1, anti- PD-L1, anti- PD-L2.  
 3.2.12 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, interstitial lung disease or active, non -infectious pneumonitis, symptomatic congestive 
heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations  that would limit compliance with study requirements.  
 3.2.13 History of other pulmonary disease such as emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, (FEV
1<60% of predicted for height and age). Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) 
are required in patients with prolonged smoking history or symptoms of respiratory dysfunction.  
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date:  March 8 , 2018 
27 
 3.2.14 Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the 
projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-study visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because MK -
3475 is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with MK -3475, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the 
mother is treated with MK -3475.   
MK-3475 may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero.  Furthermore, it is not known if 
MK-3475 has transient adverse effects on the composition  of sperm.  Patients are 
excluded from this study if pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre -screening or 
screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.   
Men and non- pregnant, non- breast -feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing to 
use 2 methods of birth control or are considered highly unlikely to conceive.  Highly unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a woman who is ≥45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 1 year will be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not heterosexually active for the duration of the study. 
The two birth control methods can be barrier method or a barrier method plus a hormonal 
method to prevent pregnancy.  Patients should start using birth control from the time of the pre-study visit, through the course of the study and for 120 days after the last dose of study medication. The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, condom (by the partner), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide.  Appropriate hormonal contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents). 
 
Patients should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks 
to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) for the duration of the study and during the follow-up period defined in section 7.7-Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation.  If there is any question that a patient will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that patient should not be entered into the study. 
 
Pregnancy: If a patient inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with MK-
3475, the patient will immed iately be removed from the study.  The site will contact the 
patient at least monthly and document the patient’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported without delay and within 24 hours i f the outcome is a serious adverse experience ( e.g., death, abortion, 
congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn).  The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn.  If a male patient impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed immediately and the pregnancy reported and followed as described in Section 7.7.

28It is unknown whether MK-3475 is excreted in human milk.  Since many drugs are 
excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the 
nursing infant, patients who are breast- feeding are not eligible for enrollment.  
 3.2.15 Patients who are Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive may participate IF they meet the following eligibility requirements: 
1. They must be stable on their anti -retroviral regimen, and they must be healthy 
from an HIV perspective.  
2. They must have a CD4 count of greater than 250 cells/mcL.  
3. They must not be receiving prophylactic therapy for an opportunistic infection. 
 3.2.16 Has known active Hepatitis B ( e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g. , HCV RNA 
[qualitative] is detected).  
3.2.17 Has received a live vaccine within 3 0 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.  
3.2.18 Has a known Human T-lymphotropic virus Type 1 (HTLV) infection.  
3.2.19 Patient has a history of (non- infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current 
pneumonitis.

294.REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
Investigator and Research Associate Registration with CTEP  
4.1.1 CTEP Registration Procedures  
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
policy require all investigators participating in any NCI- sponsored clinical trial to register 
and to renew their registration annually.  
Registration requires the submission of: 
• a completed Statement of Investigator Form  (FDA Form 1572) w ith an original 
signature  
• a current Curriculum Vitae (CV) 
• a completed and signed Supplemental Investigator Data Form  (IDF)  
• a completed Financial Disclosure Form  (FDF) with an original signature  
Fillable PDF forms and additional information can be found on the CTEP website at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/investigatorResources/investigator_registration.htm . For questions, 
please contact the CTEP Investigator Registration Hel p Desk  by email at 
pmbregpend@ctep.nci.nih.gov. 
4.1.2 CTEP Associate Registration Procedures / CTEP -IAM Account  
The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Identity and Access Management (IAM) application is a  web -based application intended for use by both Investigators (i.e., 
all physicians involved in the conduct of NCI- sponsored clinical trials) and Associates 
(i.e., all staff involved in the conduct of NCI- sponsored clinical trials).  
 Associates will use the CTEP- IAM application to register (both initial registration and 
annual re-registration) with CTEP and to obtain a user account.  Investigators will use the CTEP -IAM application to obtain a user account only. (See 
CTEP Investigator Registration Procedures above for information on registering with CTEP as an Investigator, which must be completed before a CTEP -IAM account can be 
requested.) 
An active CTEP -IAM user account is needed to access all CTEP and CTSU (Cancer 
Trials Support Unit) websites and applications, and is critical to the conduct of this study, 
including document access, patient enrollment, and clinical data submission. 
Additional information can be found on the CTEP website at

Patient Registration  
4.3.1 OPEN  
Patient enrollment will be facilitated using the Oncology Patient Enrollment Netwo rk (OPEN).  
OPEN is a web -based registration system available to users on a 24/7 basis 
All site staff will use OPEN to enroll patients to this study. It is integrated with the CTSU Enterprise System for regulatory and roster data and, upon enrollment, init ializes the patient 
position in the Rave database.  
All CITN member site staff will use OPEN to enroll patients to this study. OPEN can be 
accessed at https://open.ctsu.org or from the OPEN tab on the CTSU members’ side of the 
website at https://www.ctsu.org. 
Through both the first and second stages of this trial patient enrollment will be facilitated using the Slot-Reservation System in conjunction with the Patient Registration system in the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network (OPEN). Prior to discussing protocol entry with the patient, all site staff must use the CTSU OPEN Slot Reservation System  to ensure that a slot on the protocol is 
available to the patient. Once a slot -reservation is obtained site staff will have 14 days to 
complete screening and to enroll the patient on study.    
Prior to accessing OPEN CITN member site staff should verify the following: 
• All eligibility criteria have been met within the protocol stated timeframes. Site staff 
should use the registration forms provided on the CTSU web site as a tool to verify 
eligibility.  
• All patients have signed an appropriate consent form and HIPAA authorization form (if applicable).  
Access requirements for OPEN:  
• CITN member site staff will need to be registered with CTEP and have a valid and active CTEP- IAM account. This is the same account (user id and password) used for the CTSU 
members’ web site.

General Guidelines
Following registration, patients should begin protocol treatment as soon as possible .*  Issues that 
would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator.  If a patient does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the patient’s registration on the study may be canceled.  The Study Coordinator should be notified of cancellations as soon as possible.  
5.TREATMENT PLAN  
Agent Administration  
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.  Reported AE s and potential risks are 
described in Secti on 7. Appropriate dose modificatio ns are described in Section 6. No 
investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than those described below may be administered with the intent to treat the patient’ s malignancy. 
The treatment to be used in this trial is outlined below. 
Trial Treatment  
Drug  Dose/  
PotencyDose 
Frequency  Route of 
Administration  Regimen/  
Treatment Period  Use 
MK-3475  2mg/kg  q 3 weeks  IV infusion  Day 1 of each cycle  Experimental  
The MK -3475 dosing interval may be increased due to toxicity as described in Section 6.  
 
Note:  Calculate the required dose amount based on dose level and subject weight.  The dose 
amount should be recalculated if the subject's weight changes by more than 10% from the  
baseline measurement.  
 
Trial treatment should begin  on day 1 of treatment or as close as possible to the date on which 
treatment is enrolled.  
5.1.1 MK-3475 
Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all 
procedures/assessments have been completed.  Trial treatment may be administered up to 
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date:  March 8 , 2018 
333 days before or after the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle due to administrative reasons.   
MK-3475 treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. 
 
MK-3475 will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion (treatment cycle intervals may 
be increased due to toxicity as described in Section 6.1).  Infusion timing should be as close to 30 minutes as possible; however, a window of -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e. , infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min).

General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
5.3.1 MK-3475  
 5.3.1.1 MK-3475 Concomitant Medication 
 Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with CTEP.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the subject's primary physician; however, the decision to continue the subject on trial therapy or vaccination schedule requires the mutual agreement of the Inv estigator, CTEP, and 
the patient. 
 
Acceptable Concomitant Medications  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a patient’s welfare may be administered at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standards of medi cal care.  All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) 
including all prescription, over- the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications and 
fluids.  If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be included on the CRF. 
All concomitant medications received within 28 days before the first dose of trial treatment and 
30 days after the last dose of trial treatment should be recorded.  Concomitant medications administered after 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs.  
Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Patients are prohibited from receiving the following therapies during the Screening and Treatment Phase (including retreatment for post- complete response relapse) of this trial:  
− Anti-cancer systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy.  
− Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol. 
− Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol. 
− Investigational agents other than MK -3475. 
− Radiation th erapy  
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date:  March 8 , 2018 
34o Note:  Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may be 
allowed  after consultation with the  Protocol PI and CITN .   
− Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while participating in the trial.  Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid (oral) vaccine.  Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines ( e.g. Flu -Mist
®) are live 
attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.   Both rabies and typhoid are also available as 
killed vaccines. The killed versions of rabies and typhoid vaccines are acceptable.  
− Glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an event of suspected immunologic etiology.  The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the  Protocol PI and CITN.  
Patients who, in the assessment by the investigator, require the use of any of the aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  Patients may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary. 
The Exclusion Criteria describes other medications which are prohibited in this trial.  
There are no prohibited therapies during the Post- Treatment Follow -up Phase.  
 
5.3.2 Supportive Care Guidelines  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the treating investigator including but not limited to the items outlined below: 
• Nausea/vomiting: Nausea and vomiting should be treated aggressively, and 
consideration should be given in subsequent cycles to the administration of prophylactic antiemetic therapy  according to standard institutional practice. Subjects 
should be strongly encouraged to maintain liberal oral fluid intake. 
• Antiinfectives: Subjects with a documented infectious complication should receive oral or IV antibiotics or other antiinfective age nts as considered appropriate by the 
treating investigator for a given infectious condition, according to standard institutional practice.  
 
Duration of Therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue for up to two years, or until one of the following criteria applies:  
• Disease progression warranting alternative systemic therapy and without evidence of clinical benefit from continued MK -3475,  
• Patients who continue MK-3475 after initial disease progression will be discontin ued 
from study for any additional disease progression of 25% or more.   
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study.  
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date:  March 8 , 2018 
35 
  
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable 
for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. 
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s), including:  
 
• Any Grade 2 drug-related uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision that does not respond to topical therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severity within the re-treatment period OR requires systemic treatment.  
 
• Grade 3 drug-related autoimmune or inflammatory event including uveitis, pneumonitis, diarrhea, colitis, neurologic adverse events, hypersensitivity reaction , or infusion reaction of any duration requires discontinuation. 
 
• Any Grade 3 or 4 drug- related laboratory imbalance or electrolyte abnormality,  
not associated with underlying organ pathology and that do not require treatment except for electrolyte replacements do not require treatment discontinuation, with the following exceptions with approval of the Principal Investigator: 
 
• Hypophysitis or pan-hypopituitarism any grade should discontinue treatment.  
• Grade 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities that are not associated with DM, associated liver or gall bladder inflammation clinical manifestations of pancreatitis and which decrease to <Grade 4 within 1 week of onset may stay on study.  
 
• Any drug- related liver function test (LFT) abnormality that meets the 
follow ing criteria requires discontinuation: Grade 3 AST or ALT (>5 x ULN) 
and total bilirubin >3 x ULN. 
 
• Grade 3 drug-related thrombocytopenia >7 days or associated with bleeding requires discontinuation. 
 
• Any patient requiring therapeutic systemic steroid or other immunosuppressive 
treatment.  
 
• For patients with skin -only toxicity, when symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, 
steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  Discontinue MK-3475 if unable to reduce corti costeroid dose for irAEs to ≤10 mg. MK -3475 
treatment may be restarted and the dose modified as specified in the protocol. 
 
• Patients with peripheral thyroiditis and no other autoimmune/inflammatory event may be restarted after a short course of steroids on  a stable replacement regimen.  
 
• Any dosing interruption lasting >12 weeks with the following exceptions: 
• Dosing interruptions >12 weeks that occur for non-drug- related reasons may 
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date:  March 8 , 2018 
36be allowed if approved by the Principal Investigator.  Prior to re- initiatin g 
treatment in a subject with a dosing interruption lasting >12 weeks, the 
Principal Investigator must be consulted.  
• Tumor assessments should continue as per protocol even if dosing is interrupted. 
Duration of Follow Up 
All p atients, regardless of reaso n for discontinuation from study, will be followed  for AE /SAE  
resolution  for 30 days after removal from study.  Patients removed from study for unacceptable 
adverse event(s) will be follow ed every 12 weeks until progression is documented.  All patients 
will be followed for survival either by in -person visit  or by telephone assessment every 12 weeks 
until death .  
In subjects who discontinue study therapy without documented disease progression, every effort should be made to continue monitoring their diseas e status by Olsen assessment every 12 weeks 
(± 7 days) until (1) the start of new anticancer treatment, (2) documented disease progression, (3) death, or (4) the end of the study, whichever occurs first. If a previous assessment was obtained within 4 weeks prior to the date of discontinuation, then an additional assessment at treatment discontinuation isn’t mandatory.  
Criteria for Removal from Study  
Patients will be removed from study when any of the applicable criteri a, including progressive 
disease warr anting alternative systemic therapy and without evidence of clinical benefit on study 
therapy, withdrawal, or inability to follow study protocol as listed in Section 5.4.  The reason for study removal and the date the patient was removed must be documented  in the Case Report 
Form.  
Criteria to Resume Treatment  
For non-autoimmune or inflammatory events, patients may resume treatment with study drug when the drug- related AE(s) resolve to Grade  ≤1 or baseline value, with the following 
exceptions: 
• Patients may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigue.  
• Patients with baseline Grade 1 AST/ALT or total bilirubin who require dose delays for reasons other than a 2 -grade shift in AST/ALT or total bilirubin may resume treatment in 
the presence o f Grade 2 AST/ALT OR total bilirubin.  
• Patients with combined Grade 2 AST/ALT AND total bilirubin values meeting study parameters outlined in Section 5.4 should have treatment permanently discontinued. 
• Non-drug- related toxicity including hepatic, pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis, must 
have resolved to baseline before treatment is resumed.  
• Drug -related endocrinopathies (not including drug- related adrenal insufficiency or 
hypophysitis) adequately controlled with only physiologic hormone replacement may resume treatment after replacement correction and clinically stable regimen. 
 
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date:  March 8 , 2018 
37If the criteria to resume treatment are met, the patient should restart treatment no sooner than the 
next scheduled time point per protocol.  However, if the treatment is delaye d past the next 
scheduled time point per protocol, the treatment should resume at the earliest convenient point that is within the 12 week delay period.  
If treatment is delayed >12 weeks, the patient must be permanently discontinued from study 
therapy, e xcept as specified in Section 5.4 (Duration of Therapy). 
Treatment Beyond Progression  
Immunotherapeutic agents such as MK -3475 may produce antitumor effects by potentiating 
endogenous cancer -specific immune responses.  The response patterns seen with such an 
approach may extend beyond the typical time course of responses seen with cytotoxic agents, and can manifest as a clinical response after an initial increase in tumor burden or even the appearance of new lesions.  
 If Olsen Global Disease Assessment (i ncluding CT scans if applicable, mSWAT and Circulating 
Sézary Cells)  shows progressive disease (PD), tumor assessment may be repeated by the site 
approximately 4 weeks later in order to confirm PD with the option of continuing treatment per the instruction s below while awaiting for confirmation of progression.  If repeat disease 
assessment  shows a reduction in the tumor bur den compared to the initial assessment  
demonstrating PD, treatment may be continued as per treatm ent calendar.   In determining 
whether or not the tumor burden has increased or decreased, investigators should follow Olsen Disease Assessment Criteria (Protocol, Section 11).  The decision to continue study treatment 
after the 1st evidence of disease progression determined by disease assessment  is at the 
Investigator’s discretion based on the clinical status of the patient as described in the table below.   
A subject with unconfirmed progression of disease may continue trial treatment if clinic ally 
stable other than disease progression.  A biopsy is recommended in cases of suspected  
pseudoprogression to determine if the patient has true progression of disease or 
pseudoprogression. Patients in whom the biopsy confirms pseudoprogression based on a predominance of immune infiltrate are recommended to remain on study. Biopsy findings consistent with pseudoprogression, evidence of a lymphoid infiltrate, necrotic tumor, without significant increase in viable tumor at site of suspected pseudoprogression , may justify continued 
treatment at the discretion of the PI.  
Patients may receive study treatment while waiting for confirmation of PD if they are clinically stable as defined by the following criteria: 
• Absence o f signs and symptoms indicating disease pr ogression 
• Absence of rapid progression of disease 
• Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (e.g., cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention 
 If progression is determined at week 16 or beyond, patients will be eligible to receive continued MK-3475 if they are otherwise clinically stable as defined by the following criteria.  (The 
maximum duration of therapy in this setting is the same as for other patients, 2 years).   
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date:  March 8 , 2018 
38 
 • Absence of signs and symptoms indicating disease progression  
• Absence of rapid progression of disease 
• Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (e.g., cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative medical interventi on   
 The following assessment and stopping criteria apply to patients who continue MK-3475 beyond progression: 
• Patients who continue therapy after progression will have mSWAT performed with every cycle (every 3 weeks) and a full Olsen Criteria assessment including mSWAT, CT scans, for those with measurable disease, and CSC, if positive for Sézary cells, every 4 cyc les 
(every 12 weeks).  At the discretion of the investigator these assessments may be repeated more frequently.  
• Study drug will be discontinued if any compartment increases in value by 25% or more 
over the new baseline including mSWAT score, measurable di sease by CT scan, or 
Circulating Sezary Cell Counts.  The new baseline being defined as the assessments 
obtained at the confirmation of progression.       
Patients being treated with MK -3475 for melanoma have experienced late responses with 
continued thera py.  In the KEYNOTE-001 melanoma trial using MK-3475 there was an 
additional 3.6% response rate with continued therapy.  This category of response in that trial was 
defined as an “unconventional response” with “delayed pseudoprogression: ≥25% increase in tumor burden at any assessment after week 12 that was not confirmed as progressive disease per 
irRC at the next assessment”. [ Hodi, 2014

Subsequently, tumor imaging will be performed every 12 weeks (84 ±7 days).  
** Note:  Mycosis Fungoides and Sézary Syndrome may not be measurable by CT scan.  Disease assessments will include CT Scans (only for those patients with m easurable disease), mSWAT 
and Circulating Sézary Cell (CSC)  measurement  by flow cytometry.  All of these will be taken 
into account to assess disease progression or regression through the use of the Olsen global assessment criteria for MF/SS.  In the table above PD, SD, P R and CR will be determined by 
Global Response Assessment as described in section  11.  
Discontinuation of Treatment Following Complete Response   
Discontinuation of treatment may be considered for patients who have attained a confirmed complete response (CR) that have been treated for at least 24 weeks with MK -3475 and had at 
least two treatments with MK -3475 beyond the date when the initial CR was declared.   
Treatment Up to 2 Years 
Treatment with MK -3475 monotherapy will continue for up to two years .  Treatment will be 
discontinued for documented disease progression in patients warranting other systemic therapy 
as described above, unacceptable adverse event(s), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, investigator’s decision to withdraw the patient, patient withdraws consent, pregnancy of the patient, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements, or administrative reasons.

Patients who experience a recurrence of the same severe or life-threatening event at the same grade or great er with re -challenge of MK -3475 should be 
discontinued from trial treatment.  
 Additionally, immune-related adverse events (irAEs), defined as adverse events of unknown

 etiology, associated with drug exposure and consistent with an immune phenomenon, may be 
predicted based on the nature of the MK-3475 compound, its mechanism of action, and reported experience with immunotherapies that have a similar mechanism of action.  Special attention should be paid to AEs that may be suggestive of potential irAEs.  An irAE can occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment.  All AEs of unknown etiology associated with drug exposure should be evaluated to determine if they are possibly immune -related.  If an irAE is suspected, effort s should be made to rule out neoplastic, 
infectious, metabolic, toxin or other etiologic causes prior to labeling an adverse event as an irAE.

 The table below includes recommendations on the management of specific AEs and when to hold and/or discontinue MK -3475.  These guidelines are intended to be applied when the 
investigat or determines the events to be treatment -related.  Note: if after the evaluation the event 
is determined not to be related, the investigator does not need to follow the treatment guidance. Therefore, these recommendations should be seen as guidelines and t he treating physician should 
exercise individual clinical judgment based on the patient.

• Treat with high -dose IV glucocorticosteroids for 24-48 
hours.  When symptoms improve to grade 1 or less, a steroid taper with dexamethasone 4 mg every 4 hours or 
prednisone at 1- 2 mg/kg should be started and continued 
over no less than 4 weeks.  
• If serum transaminase levels do not decrease 48 hours after initiation of systemic steroids, oral mycophenolate mofetil 
500 mg every 12 hours may be given.  Infliximab is not 
recommended due to its potential for hepatotoxicity

52 6.1.3 Treatment Guidelines for Infusion Reactions  
 
Acute infusion reactions (which can include cytokine release syndrome, angioedema, or anaphylaxis) are different from allergic/hypersensitive reactions, although some of the manifestations are common to both AEs.  Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.   Signs/symptoms may include: Allergic reaction/hypersensitivity (including drug fever); Arthralgia (joint pain); Bronchospasm; Cough; Dizziness; Dys pnea (shortness of breath); Fatigue 
(asthenia, lethargy, malaise); Headache; Hypertension; Hypotension; Myalgia (muscle pain); Nausea; Pruritis/itching; Rash/desquamation; Rigors/chills; Sweating (diaphoresis); Tachycardia; Tumor pain (onset or exacerbation of tumor pain due to treatment); Urticaria (hives, welts, wheals); Vomiting.  
 
The table below shows treatment guidelines for subjects who experience an infusion reaction associated with administration of MK -3475.

IV fluids  
Antihistamines  
NSAIDS  
Acetaminophen 
Narcotics  
Increase monitoring of vital signs as medically indicated until the subject is deemed medically 
stable in the opinion of the investigator.  
If symptoms resolve within one hour of stopping drug infusion, the infusion may be 
restarted at 50% of the original infusion rate 
(e.g. from 100 mL/hr to 50 mL/hr).  Please 
note: prior to restarting the infusion, confirm 
that the 4 hour room temperature stability from the time of the IV bag preparation will not be 
exceeded.  Otherwise dosing will be held until 
symptoms resolve and the subject should be 
premedicated for the next scheduled dose.  
Subjects who develop Grade 2 toxicity upon rechallenge despite adequate premedication 
should be permanently discontinued from 
further trial treatme nt administration.   
Subject may be premedicated 1.5h (± 30 minutes) prior to infusion of 
MK-3475 with:  
 Diphenhydramine 50 mg PO (or 
equivalent dose of antihistamine).  
 Acetaminophen 500-1000 mg PO 
(or equivalent dose of antipyretic).

7.ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.2) will determine whether the event requires expedited reporting via the CTEP Adverse Event Reporting System (CTEP- AERS) in addition  to routine  reporting.  
Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks List (CAEPR)  
The Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of reported and/or potential AE associated with an agent using a uniform presentation of events by 
body system. In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset of AEs , the Specific Protocol 
Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and is identified with 
bold and italicized text.  The SPEER is a list of events that are protocol -specific exceptions to 
expedited reporting to NCI via CTEP -AERS  (except as noted below). Refer to the ‘CTEP, NCI 
Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements’ http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/adverse_effects.htm for further clarification.  
Note : The highest grade currently reported is noted in parentheses next to the AE in the SPEER.  
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date:  March 8 , 2018 
54 
 Report ONLY AEs higher than this grade expeditiously via CTEP- AERS . If this CAEPR is part 
of a combination protocol using multiple investigational agents and has an AE listed on different 
SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is required.

The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of reported 
and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform presentation of events by 
body system. In addition to the comprehensive list,  a subset, the Specific Protocol Exceptions to 
Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and is identified with bold and italicized 
text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are protocol specific exceptions to expedited 
reporting to NCI (except as noted below).  Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting 
Requirements' http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf  
for further clarification. Frequency is provided based on 3793 patients. Below is the CAEPR for MK- 3475 
(pembrolizumab, NSC 776864).  
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in parentheses next to the 
AE in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple investigational agents and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is required.

Adverse Event Characteristics  
• CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0will be utilized  until March 31, 2018 for AE reporting. CTCAE version 5.0 will be 
utilized for AE reporting beginning April 1, 2018. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to  a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can 
be downloaded from the CTEP web site http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date:  March 8 , 2018 
58• For expedited reporting purposes only:   
- AEs for the agent that are bold and italicized in the CAEPR ( i.e., those listed in the 
SPEER column, Section 7.1.1) should be reported through CTEP- AERS  only if the 
grade is above the grade provided in the SPEER. 
- Other AEs for the protocol that do not require expedited reporting are outlined in 
section 7.3.4 . 
• Attribution  of the AE: 
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment. 
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment. 
 
Expedited Adverse Event Reporting  
7.3.1 Expedited AE reporting for this study must use CTEP- AERS  (CTEP Adverse Event 
Reporting System), acces sed via the CTEP Web site ( https://eapps-
ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers ).  The reporting procedures to be followed are presented in the 
“NCI Guidelines for Investigators: Adverse Event Reporting Requiremen ts for DCTD 
(CTEP and CIP) and DCP INDs and IDEs” which can be downloaded from the CTEP 
Web site (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm
).  These requirements are briefly outlined in the tables below (Section 7.3.3). 
In the rare occurrence when Internet connectivity is lost, a 24-hour notification is to be 
made to CTEP by telephone at 301- 897-7497.  Once Inter net connectivity is restored, the 
24-hour notification phoned in must be entered electronically into CTEP- AERS  by the 
original submitter at the site.  
 
7.3.2 CTEP- AERS  is programmed for automatic electronic distribution of reports to the 
following individuals:  Principal Investigator and Adverse Event Coordinator(s) (if applicable) of the Corresponding Organization, the local treating physician, and the Reporter and Submitter.  CTEP -AERS  provides a copy feature for other e- mail recipients.  
 The Coordinating Center of the Corresponding Organization is responsible for submitting to the CTSU documentation of AEs that they deem reportable for posting on the CTSU protocol web page and inclusion on the CTSU bi-monthly broadcast. 
 7.3.3 Expedited Reporting Guidelines 
Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol- specific patient ID assigned during trial 
registration on all reports.  
Note:  A death on study requires both  routine and expedited reporting , regardless of 
causality ..  Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided.  
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date:  March 8 , 2018 
59 
 Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Disease progression ” 
in the system organ class (SOC) “General disorders and administration site conditions.”   
Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease ( e.g., radiological 
changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a 
disease process) should be submitted.  
  
Pregnancy loss 
• Pregnancy loss is defined in CTCAE as “Death in utero.” 
• Any Pregnancy loss should be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 “Pregnancy loss” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC. 
• A pregnancy loss should NOT be reported as a Grade 5 event under the 
Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC, as currently 
CTEPAERS recognizes this event as a patient death.   
 A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4, “Death neonatal” under the General disorders and administration SOC.

Adverse Events that Occur on Studies under an IND/IDE within 30 Days of the Last 
Administration of the Investigational Agent/Intervention1, 2 
FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:  Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY  Serious Adverse Events, whether or not 
they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
 An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization for 
≥24 hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST  be immediately reported to the NCI via 
AdEERS within the timeframes detailed in the table below.

NOTE: Protocol -specific exceptions to expedited reporting of serious adverse events are found in the Specific 
Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) portion of the CAEPR  
Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as:  
o “24-Hour; 5 Calendar Days ” - The AE must initially be reported via AdEERS within 24 hours of learning 
of the AE, followed by a complete expedited report within 5 calendar days of the initial 24- hour report.  
o “10 Calendar Days ” - A complete expedited report on the AE must be submitted within 10 calendar 
days of learning of the AE.  
1Serious adverse events that occur more than 30 days after the last administration of investigational 
agent/intervention and have an attribution of possible, probable, or definite require reporting as follows:  
Expedited 24-hour notification followed by complete report within 5 calendar days for:  
• All Grade 4, and Grade 5 AEs  
Expedited 10 calendar day reports for:  
• Grade 2 adverse events resulting in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
• Grade 3 adverse events  
2 For studies using PET or SPECT IND agents, the AE reporting period is limited to 10 radioactive half -lives, 
rounded UP to the nearest whole day, after the agent/intervention was last administered.  Footnote “1” above 
applies after this reporting period.   
Effective  Date:  May 5, 2011  
 
7.3.4 Additional Protocol- Specific Expedited Adverse Event Reporting Exclusions 
For this protocol only, the AEs/grades listed below  do not require expedited reporting via 
CTEP- AERS . However, they still must  be reported through the routine reporting 
mechanism (Section 7.4):

Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
All Adverse Events must  be reported in routine study data submissions.  AEs reported 
expeditiously through CTEP- AERS  must also be reported in routine study data 
submissions.  
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents.  AEs are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during the trial using Medidata Rave.   
Secondary Malignancy 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm. 
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an 
NCI IND/IDE be reported expeditiously via CTEP -AERS .  Three options are available to 
describe the event: 
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.   
Second Malignancy  
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY routine AE reporting unless otherwise specified.  
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date:  March 8 , 2018 
627.7 Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation to the Sponsor 
Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered adverse events, it is the responsibility of 
investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy or lactation in a subject (spontaneously reported to them) that occurs during the trial or within 120 days of completing the trial, or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier.  All subjects who become pregnant must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy.  Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events).  If the pregnancy continues to term, 
the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported. 
8.PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
A list of the AEs and potential risks asso ciated with the investigational agent  administered in this 
study can be found in Section 7.1. 
CTEP IND Agent (s) (MK -3475) 
8.1.1 MK-3475 (SCH 900475) (NSC 776864) 
Other Names: SCH 900475  
Classification : Anti-PD-1 MAb  
Molecular Weight: 148.9-149.5 KDa 
 
CAS Number:  1374853-91-4  
 Mode of Action : The programmed cell death 1 (PD -1) receptor is  an inhibitory receptor expressed 
by T cells.  When bound to either of its ligands, PD -L1 or PD -L2, activated PD -1 negatively 
regulates T -cell activation and effector function.  The pathway may be engaged by tumor cells to 
suppress immune control.  MK -3475 blocks the negative immune regulatory signaling by binding 
to the PD- 1 receptor, inhibiting the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands. 
 Description: MK-3475 is a humanized MAb of the IgG4/kappa isotype. 
 How Supplied: MK-3475 is supplied by Merck & Co., Inc. and distributed by the Pharmaceutical 
Management Branch, CTEP/DCTD/NCI as single- use 50 mg vials containing a sterile, non -
pyrogenic white to off -white lyophilized powder formulated in 10mM histidine buffer, pH 5.2-5.8, 
containing 7% sucrose and 0.02% polysorbate 80. 
Preparation:  Allow the required number of MK -3475 vials to equilibrate to room temperature.  
Reconstitute the lyophilized powder by adding 2.3 mL of Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) to the 
vial to yie ld 2.4 mL of solution containing 25 mg/mL of MK -3475.  The vial contains an excess 
fill of 10 mg (0.4 mL) to ensure recovery of 50 mg (2 mL) per vial.  Add SWFI along the walls of 
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date:  March 8 , 2018

 the vial to avoid foaming.  Swirl the vial, do not shake.  Discard vial if e xtraneous particulate matter 
other than translucent to white proteinaceous particles is observed.  Do not use if discolored.  To 
prepare the final solution for IV administration add the dose volume of MK -3475 to an infusion bag 
containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and gently invert the bag 10- 15 times to mix the 
solution.  The final concentration must be between 1 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL . 
 
Compatible IV bag materials: PVC plasticized with DEHP, non -PVC (polyolefin), EVA, 
or PE lined polyolefin  Calculat e the required dose amount based on dose level and subject weight.  The dose 
amount should be recalculated if the subject's weight changes by more than 10% from the baseline measurement.  
 
Storage: Store intact vials between 2°C - 8°C (36°F - 46°F).  Do not  freeze.  If a storage 
temperature excursion is identified, promptly return MK -3475 to between 2-8°C and quarantine 
the supplies.  Provide a detailed report of the excursion (including documentation of temperature 
monitoring and duration of the excursion) to PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov for determination of suitability.  
  Stability: Stability testing of the intact vials is on -going . 
 Administer prepared solutions immediately after preparation.  If not administered immediately, prepared solutions may be stored refrigerated for up to 20 hours.  MK -3475 solutions may be stored 
at room temperature for a cumulative time of up to 4 hours.  This includes room temperature storage 
of reconstituted solution in vials, room temperature storage of admixture solutions in the  IV bags, and 
the duration of infusion.  
 
Route  of Administration: IV infusion only.  Do not administer as an IV push or bolus injection. 
 Method of Administration : Infuse over approximately 30 minutes (range: 25 - 40 minutes) using an 
infusion set containing a low -protein binding 0.2 to 5 µm in- line filter made of polyethersulfone or 
polysulfone.  Infusion rate should not exceed 6.7 mL/min.  A central line is not required; however 
if a subject has a central venous catheter in place, it is recommended that i t be used for the infusion.  
Do not co -administer other drugs through the same infusion line.  
 
Compatible infusion set materials: PVC plasticized with DEHP or DEHT, PVC and tri -(2-
ethylhexyl) trimellitate, polyethylene lined PVC, polyurethane, or polybutadiene  
Patient Care Implications: Refer to the protocol for information on evaluation and management of potential immune- related adverse events.  
 
Availability  
 MK-3475 is an investigational agent supplied to investigators by the Division of Cancer 
Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), NCI. 
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date:  March 8 , 2018

MK-3475 is provided to the NCI under a Collaborative Agreement between the 
Pharmaceutical Collaborator and the DCTD, NCI (see Section 12.3).  
8.1.2 N/A 
 
8.1.3 Agent Ordering and Agent Accountability 
 8.1.3.1 NCI-supplied agents may be requested by the Principal Investigator (or their 
authorized designee) at each participating institution.  Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) policy requires that agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be treated.  PMB does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prior approval from PMB is obtained).  The CTEP- assigned 
protocol number must be used for ordering all CTEP-supplied investigational agents.  The responsible investigator at each participating institution must be registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual submission of FDA Form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), Curriculum Vitae, Supplemental Investigator Data Form (IDF), and Financial Disclosure Form (FDF).  If there are several participating investigators at one institution, CTEP-supplied investigational agents for the study should be ordered under the name of one lead investigator at that institution.  
 
Active CTEP -registered investigators and investigator- designated shipping designees 
and ordering designees can submit agent requests through the PMB Online Agent Order Processing (OAOP) application (
https://eapps-
ctep.nci.nih.gov/OAOP/pages/login.jspx ).  Access to OAOP requires the 
establishment of a CTEP Identity and Access Management (IAM) account (
https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/iam/ ) and the maintenance of an “active” account 
status and a “current” password.  For questions about drug orders, transfers, returns, or accountability, call (240) 276-6575 Monday through Friday between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm (ET) or email 
PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov  anytime. 
 
8.1.3.2 Agent Inventory Records – The investigator, or a responsible party designated by the investigator, must maintain a careful record of the inventory and disposition of all agents received from DCTD using the NCI Drug Accountability Record Form (DARF).  (See the NCI Investigator’s Ha ndbook for Procedures for Drug 
Accountability and Storage.) 
  9. BIOMARKER, CORRELATIVE, AND SPECIAL STUDIES  
 This study will require approximately 500 mL of blood to be drawn during the first 3 cycles (9 weeks) of therapy. After this, approximately 250 mL of blood will be drawn every 9 weeks. 
These quantities include blood drawn for safety labs, research labs, and for the biorepository. In the interest of patient safety we are including a provision to draw less blood if patients are anemic.  A CBC will be p erformed as part of the safety labs each time research labs and 
biorepository blood needs to be drawn. The results of the CBC will be reviewed and the 
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date:  March 8 , 2018 
65following blood volumes will be drawn based upon the patient hemoglobin level: 
• For a hemoglobin over 10.0, draw the full volume of blood for safety labs, research labs, 
and for the biorepository. The biorepository volume of 100 mL will include 10  mL for 
plasm a, and 90 mL of whole blood to be used for cells.  
• For a hemoglobin between 9.0 and 10.0, draw the full volume of blood for safety labs and 
research labs, however draw only 30 mL for the biorepository as opposed to drawing the 
full 100 mL. The 30 mL will include 10  mL for plasma and 20 mL of whole blood to be 
used for cells.   
• For a hemoglobin less than 9.0, only draw the safety labs which will include a CBC and a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel.
Biomarker Studies  
To assess the immune response and pre-determined correlative studies a skin biopsy will be collected and peripheral blood (98mL total) collected at baseline.  Blood samples will also be collected after cycle 1 (on the first day of cycle 2, prior to dosing) then on the first day of every 3
rd cycle thereafter , prior to dosing (i .e., day 1 cycle 5, day 1 cycle 8, day 1 cycle 11, etc.), and at 
time of confirmed CR or PR, & at PD or EOT visit.  After the skin punch biopsy at baseline patients must also provide a biopsy at the time of a clinical event (at the time of response, progression or appearance of a new lesion) and at the end of treatment.  Additional punch biopsies every 3 cycles are optional.  An archival tissue sample is optional.    
All patients will have an additional 10ml of blood drawn at each of the above specified intervals 
for Kyn/Trp ratio testing.  We have listed this test as a “ Special  Correlative Study ” as opposed to 
a Biomarker Study because we will be testing Kyn/Trp ratio as a potential mechanism of resistance.  Table 9.1 Tumor Tissue and Blood Collection

9.1.1 Archival Tissue 
Archival tissue is not mandatory, however if it is available  and if the patient has given 
permission in the consent form an FFPE block will be sent to the CITN Central Laboratory where slides will be made and shipped to Qualtek for Chromogenic (Single-Color) IHC for PD -L1 and to Merck, Palo Alto, for Multiparametric (Two -Color) IHC 
and Transcriptional Analyses using the Nanostring platform. If archival tissue is not available it is important to review the pathology report and confirm the diagnosis.  
Skin specimens may be obtained at other study visits depending on principal investigator 
decision. At the response/PD visit and the end of treatment visit, 2 side -by-side 5 -mm 
punch biopsies may be optionally obtained from each [anatomical] site biopsied at 
screening. Biopsies will be obtained at the respective Cancer Center clinics according to their clinical SOPs.  
If a patient has known lymph node disease an optional Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) of the lymph node and an optional  core biopsy of the lymph node will be obtained at 
screening,  after cycle 1, after every 3
rd cycle,  at response/PD visit, and end of treatment 
visit.  Patients may refuse the lymph node biopsies and still participate in the trial.  Patients may agree to only one type of lymph node biopsy (FNA or Core) if they are uncomfortable providing both and still participate in the trial.  Lymph node biopsies and core biopsies will 
be obtained at the respective Cancer Center according to their clinical SOP’s.

After Cycle 1, pre-dose laboratory procedures can be conducted up to 72 hours prior to dosing. Results must be reviewed by the investigator or qualified designee and found to be acceptable prior to each dose of trial treatment.  
9.1.2.2 Circulating Tumor  Cells  (will be referred to as circulating  Sézary c ells or 
CSCs in this protocol). 
In this protocol Sé zary c ells are defined as T c ells which are either CD4
+CD7- OR 
CD4+CD26 -. For an individual patient only one of the phenotypes will be used, not both. 
The protocol allows the use of either CD4+CD7- or CD4+CD26- T cells since there is 
variation in which phenotype best represents an individual patient’s Sézary phenotype. The Olsen Criteria for response assessment include the use of either phenotype. 
[Olsen 
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date:  March 8 , 2018 
682011]  
One of the Global Measurements for response will be Response in Blood which will 
involve a quantitative measurement of blood tumor burden using flow cytometry (testing for the percentage of Circulating Sézary Cells).  This test is considered Standard-of- Care 
for patients with MF/SS   so the flow cytometry f or CSC testing will take place at the 
individual research sites.   Since this test will be used as part of the disease assessment it 
will be performed at the same time points as the CT scans (for those with measurable disease) and mSWAT testing.  Circulatin g Sézary Cell (CSC) burden will be determined 
at baseline then again at week 12 (after 4  doses of MK -3475).  If progression is seen at 
week 12 CSC will be repeated at week 16.  If no progression is seen at week 12 CSC will be repeated at week 1 8.  CSC will  be repeated every 2 cycles (every 6 weeks) out to week 
#30 (including week 24 and week 30).  Repeat CSC after week 30 will take place  every 4 
cycles (every 12 weeks) including week 42, 54, 66, 78, 90 and 104 (end of study). 
All patients who are positive for CSC’s in blood at baseline should receive continued 
CSC testing at the intervals described above.  Those patients who have measurable disease by CT scan (either LN or viscera) should receive continued CSC testing per the above schedule EVEN if they are negative at baseline.  Those patients who do NOT have measurable disease by CT scan should NOT have regular, ongoing, CSC testing if they are negative at baseline however these patients will have repeat CSC testing for CR, PR, PD or EOT.   As a quality assurance tool for this trial we will obtain data from all CSC 
results and send the data to Stanford University for central review by their pathologists.   
Laboratory Correlative Studies  
The biomarker and correlative studies that will be performed at the time  points described above 
are as follows:  
9.2.1 Chromogenic (Single -Color) IHC for PD- L1 - Laboratory Correlative Study #1.  
PD-L1 expression has been identified as a potential biomarker for response to anti -PD-1 
therapy. We will test whether PD -L1 expression corr elates with MK -3475 r esponse in the 
MF/SS population. 
9.2.1.1 Collection of Specimen(s) :  Specimens will include archived and 
prospectively obtained tumor biopsies including skin and/or lymph nodes 
including possible punch and/or core biopsies  
9.2.1.1.1. Timing of specimen collection will include a biopsy at

 9.2.1.3 Shipping of Specimen(s).  Participating sites will send biopsy tissue in 
formalin  for overnight delivery to the CITN C entral  Laboratory. The CITN 
Central Laboratory  or designate  will prepare FFPE blocks then prepare slides. 
Slides will be sent to Qualtek for staining with anti-22C3 an ti-PD-L1 IHC 
Assay.  
9.2.1.4 Site(s) Performing Correlative Study.  Merck CRO, Qualtek , will perform the 
testing using the slides sent by the CITN Central Laboratory.   
9.2.2 Multiparametric (Two -Color) IHC – Laboratory Correlative Study #2. 
Spatial association of PD -1+ TILs and PD -L1+ cells (tumor and myeloid cells) suggests 
“induction” of PD -L1. Interferon-gamma production by antigenspecific PD-1+ CD8+ T 
cells is hypothesized to drive local intratumoral upregulation of PD-L1 on adjacent tumor 
and myeloid cells, leading to a “ stalled CTL ” response which may be predictive of 
response to MK -3475 therapy. By assessing both of the required elements, i.e., PD -L1 
positive cells and PD -1+ T cells, a two -color IHC assay may be a better predictor of 
response than PD -L1 positivity alone.  Immunohistochemical staining for CD3 and CD8 
may also be performed if funds become available. 
9.2.2.1 Collection of Specimen(s)  
9.2.2.1.1. Specimens will include archived and prospectively obtained tumor 
biopsies from skin and/or lymph nodes including possible punch and/or core biopsies 
9.2.2.1.2. Timing of specimen collection will include a biopsy at baseline, at the time of a clinical event (at the time of response, progression or appearance of a new lesion) and at the end of treatment.  Additional punch biopsies every 3 cycles are optional.    
9.2.2.2 Handling of Specimen(s). Biopsy samples will be placed in formalin and shipped to the CITN Central Laboratory. 
9.2.2.3 Shipping of Specimen(s).  Participating sites will send biopsy tissue in 
formalin to the CITN C entral Laboratory. The CITN Central L aboratory  or 
designate will prepare FFPE blocks then prepare slides.  Slides will be sent to 
Merck, Palo Alto, whe re multiparametric immunohistochemical assays will be 
performed to identify and enumerate key cellular components and immunoregulatory molecules to include PD-1, PD-L1, among other analytes. 
9.2.2.4 Site(s) Performing Correlative Study . Merck, Palo Alto, will perform the 
testing using the slides sent by the CITN Central Laboratory.  
9.2.3 Transcriptional Analyses – Laboratory Correlative Study #3. The Nanostring platform will be used to profile mRNA expression in archival material, to assess expression of approximately 650 genes and attempt to define a gene set critical for clinical response to MK -3475. The hypothesis to be tested is that MK-3475 responders 
will exhibit a “stalled Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL)” response within the tumor 
reflected in the physical proximity between PD -1 and PD-L1 expression and the presence

 of an aborted (e.g., weak but discernible) INF -γ transcriptional program .  
9.2.3.1 Collection of Specimen(s)  
9.2.3.1.1. Specimens will include archived and prospectively obtained tumor 
biopsies including skin and/or lymph nodes including possible punch and/or core biopsies  
9.2.3.1.2. Timing of specimen collection will include a biopsy at baseline, at the time of a clinical event (at the time of response, progression or appearance of a new lesion) and at the end of treatment.  Additional punch biopsies every 3 cycles are optional.

designate will prepare FFPE blocks then prepare slides.  Slides will be sent to 
Merck, Palo Alto for Nanostring analysis and global profiling by next-generation sequencing (RNAseq). 
9.2.3.4 Site(s) Performing Correlative Study.  Merck, Palo Alto, will perform the 
testing  using the slides sent by the CITN Central Laboratory. 
9.2.4 Immunophenotyping & T cell function assays -Laboratory Correlative Study #4. 
CyTOF and multiparametric flow cytomety will be employed to extensively immunophenotype the tumor and associated immune infiltrates both prior to and during MK-3475 treatment. We anticipate that these studies will provide a more granular view 
of the tolerized PD -1
+ target cell and its response to anti -PD-1 blockade, which will guide 
the future choice of rational immunomodulatory combination therapies. In addition, other cell types (e.g. , Tregs and myeloid- derived cells with T cell suppressor function) and 
immunomodulatory molecules (e.g., IL -10) may be identified as additional components 
of the immunosuppressive milieu in MF/SS.  
Immunophenotyping will be augmented by assays of T cell function. Activation of 
discrete T cell subsets and/or combinations of T cells with putative “suppressor cells ” 
will be assayed by int racellular cytokines, ce ll surface activation markers of  proli feration 
when challenged with autologous tumor cells or autologous dendritic cells pulsed with tumor lysate.

Special Studies  (Kyn/Trp Ratio)  
9.3.1 Special Correlative Study #1 : Whole Blood Kyn/Trp Ratios 
Kyn/Trp ratios will be assayed in patients receiving a regimen of MK -3475 as measured 
in peripheral blood at baseline and at specified intervals throughout the trial.  We have 
defined the Kyn/Trp Ratio as a special study because the results may help to elucidate a 
likely mechanism for anti- PD-1 failure.  It is postulated that enhanced IDO expression 
may occur in patients who fail anti- PD-1 therapy. IDO catabolizes the co nversion of 
Tryptophan to Kynurenine , which has potent immunosuppressant properties. An increase 
in Kynurenine levels over time, relative to Tryptophan levels, in patients who are failing anti-PD-1 therapy would indicate that IDO expression may be leading to treatment 
failure.  This mechanism of resistance could potentially be overcome with an IDO 
inhibitor.

assessments are done at the same time. mSWAT and CSC may be done on the same day as the CT scans or they may be done another day that week if n eeded for patient 
convenience.   If patients continue therapy after progression, mSWAT will increase to every cycle.  CT or PET/CT and CSC (both, if indicated) will continue every 4 cycles.    
o. Blood for biomarkers will be drawn during screening (within 28 days), again after the first cycle (day 1 of cycle 2, prior to study drug infusion), then prior to study drug infusion on 
day 1 of every 3rd cycle (i.e., day 1, cycle 5, 8, 11, 14, etc.) then again for a confirmed CR or PR and at the time of PD and at EOT. Mandatory and optional biopsies will be 
performed at these same time points  
**CSC Testing will be performed at the individual research sites with central review of results at Stanford University.  Refer to section 9.1.2.2 for additional CSC testing informa tion.

7911.MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT 
 
Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
MF and SS are unique in that some patients will not have disea se that is measurable by CT or 
PET/CT.  Patients who have cutaneous disease only  will not have measurable disease by CT or 
PET/CT.  Patients who have extracutaneous disease will have disease that is measurable by CT or 
PET/CT. Patients with measurable (extracutaneous) disease will have scans at the intervals 
specified in  the paragraph below. Pa tients who have nonmeasurable disease by CT and/or PET 
CT will have a scan at baseline (before study drug is initiated).  This scan will be done as 
standard of care before study entry and will be used to determine the presence or absence or 
measurable disease. Subsequent scans in patients with nonmeasurable disease will only occur at the discretion of the investigator. Patients with nonmeasurable disease will not be required to have repeat scans for CR, PR or SD.   
There will be other criteria in addition to standard radiographic evaluation used in this study to determine progression or regression of disease including mSWAT (modified severity-weighted assessment tool) to determine response in skin.  Flow cytometry will be used to determine the 
number of circula ting sézary  cells  (CSC’s)  in the blood in order to evaluate response. Lastly, all 
of the measures including Skin (mSWAT), Lymph Nodes (CT), Visceral Disease (CT) and Blood (Flow Cytometry) will be combined to determine a Global Response Score. All of these  
evaluations, including the Global Response Score will be described in further detail in this section of the protocol. 
The tests other than radiographic scans will include mSWAT and flow cytometry for CSCs . 
These tests will be performed  on all patients (th ose with and without measurable disease)  at the 
same intervals as CT scans described in the next paragraph  for patients with measurable disease.  
All assessments including CT scans (for patients with measurable disease), mSWAT , and CSC 
will be performed at the same intervals and time points.  Assessments for patients with 
measurable disease will include radiologic scans, mSWAT and CSC.  Assessments for patients with nonmeasurable disease will consist of mSWAT and CSC  (if indicated). 
For the purposes of this study, patients will first  be assessed for response at week 12 (after 4 
cycles of MK -3475).  If  progression is seen at week 12, confirmatory assessments will be 
repeated at w eek 16.  If no  progression is seen at week 12, assessments will be repeated at week 
18. Assessments will  then be repeated every 2 cycles (every 6  weeks) until week #30.  
(Assessments will be repeated at week 24 and week 30).  Repeat assessments after week 30  will 
take place every 4 cycles (every 12 weeks) including week #42, 54, 66, 78, 90 and 104 (end of study). Assessments will also be performed at the time of CR/PR confirmation, or PD.  Note:  
Only patients with extracutaneous disease (measurable by CT scan) will have scans done at these specified intervals.  Those with nonmeasurable dis ease are only scanned at baseline, then  at the 
discr etion of the investigator.  Patients with nonmeasurable disease will not be required to have 
repeat scans for CR, PR , or SD.   
If a CR is achieved patients may stop study drug therapy after 2 additional cycles have been 
given after 6 months of therapy have been completed. (i .e., 6 months + 2 cycles). If patients who 
have stopped after a CR have disease recurrence, they may re-start therapy if they have not 
 
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date: March 8, 2018 
  
80 
 received additional therapy in the interim, if they are still eligible for the trial and the trial is still 
open to enrollment. Patients who are treated again after a CR will have scans, tests, procedures, biopsies and study drug administration at intervals just like a new patient beginning protocol therapy.  
11.1.1 Definitions  
Evaluable for toxicity . All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their 
first treatment with  MK-3475.  
Evaluable for objective response. As described above patients enrolled in this trial may 
not have disease that is measurable by CT and/or PET/CT however they can still be 
objectively evaluated for disease response using parameters unique to MF/SS.  
11.1.2 Disease Parameters N/A  
11.1.3 Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease  
The primary outcome is antitumor effect. Definitions for global response, CR, PR , PD, 
and SD  (in skin/LN/viscera/blood) are detailed here.  
11.1.3.1 Measurement Methods  
• Skin: mSWAT.  
• Lymph nodes: CT or PET/ CT (Olsen criteria).  
• Viscera: CT or PET/ CT (Olsen criteria).  
o If using a PET/CT the CT should be of diagnostic quality 
• Blood: Flow cytometry. 
The skin compartment is the target of primary efficacy assessment, however in those subjects with extracutaneous disease, all involved compartments will be assessed separately and a global response will be determined. 
Subjects will have a skin evalu ation  (mSWAT)  at screening, then again at week 12 (after 
4 cycles of MK -3475). m SWAT will be rep eated at week 16  if patients have progressive 
disease (PD) at week 12 . If no PD  is seen at week 12 , the mSWAT will be repeated at 
week 18.  mSWAT will then be repeated every 2 cycles ( every 6 weeks)  to week #30 
including assessment s at week 24 and week 30.  After week 30 mSWAT will be repeated 
every 4 cycles (every 12 weeks) including week 42, 54, 66, 78, 90 and 104 (end of study).   Clinical response in the skin compartment will be assessed according to changes in the modified Severity -Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) [Appendix E]
 and 
documented as SD, P R, complete clinical response, or PD as defined below. The 
response in the lymph node compartment will be assessed by IWG criteria, in blood by flow cytometry, and global response will be assigned adhering to the consensus criteri a 
below. All objective response (PR or CR) and progression (PD) must be confirmed after 4 weeks.   
Regardless of treatment delays, response assessment including mSWAT and imaging should always be performed on the aforementioned schedules. (i.e., t he imaging and 
mSWAT schedules do not change if there are treatment delays). Subjects with CR after 
 
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date: March 8, 2018 
  
81 
 receiving a minimum of 6 months of treatment with at least 2 doses since CR may 
discontinue therapy. Subjects with a CR who progress may be retreated if (1) no cancer 
treatment was administe red since the last dose of MK -3475, (2) subject continues to meet 
eligibility criteria, and  (3) the trial is open. Subjects without symptomatic progression 
may receive up to a maximum of 2 years if radiologically and clinically improving or stable after 12  cycles.  
11.1.4 Initial Tumor Imaging  
Initial tumor imaging with a  CT or  PET/CT must be performed within 28 days prior to 
the first dose of trial treatment.  For subjects with documented extracutaneous disease 
imaging will be repeated at the intervals specified in  section 11.1
. For consistency in 
interpretation, perform the same type of radiologic evaluation that was performed at screening. All subjects on the trial will have an EOT scan. Scans performed as part of routine clinical management are acceptable for use as the screening scan if they are of diagnostic quality and performed within 28 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. Imaging timing should follow calendar days and should not be adjusted for delays in cycle starts or extension of MK-3475 cycle frequencies. The same imaging technique should be used in a subject throughout the trial. The site study team must review pre- trial 
images to confirm the subject has measurable disease per Olsen criteria if the patient is going to be entered on trial with radiographically measurable disease. Patients with 
only cutaneous disease (nonmeasurable by CT) are also eligible for the study.  
11.1.5 Tumor Imaging During Trial  
Tumor imaging may be performed by full-body CT or full- body PET/C T and the same 
imaging technique should be used in a subject throughout the trial as response will be assessed by Olsen criteria. Im aging should be performed as described in section 11.1.3
 
Imaging should be performed if possible progression is considered or to confirm response. Imaging should not be delayed for delays in cycle starts or extension of MK-3475 cycle intervals.  
11.1.5.1 Measurement Methods  
- Lymph nodes: CT or PET- CT (Olsen criteria).  
- Viscera: CT or PET -CT (Olsen cr iteria).  
If using a PET/CT the CT should be of diagnostic quality. Imaging should continue to be performed until documented disease progression, the start of new anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, death, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first. Disease progression should be confirmed at least 4 weeks a fter the first scan indicating PD  in 
clinically stable subjects. Subjects who have unconfirmed disease progression may continue on treatment until progression is confirmed provided they have met the conditions detailed in 
Sectio n 5.8 .  
Conventional CT and MRI . This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  If CT scans have 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion sh ould be 
twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g., for body 
 
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date: March 8, 2018 
  
82 
 scans).   
PET -CT. At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for accurate measurement . 
However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of 
identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT 
portion of t he PET-CT can be used for tumor measurements and can be used  
interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time. 
Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
11.1.6 Response Criteria  
Primary outcome measure is clinical response rate as assessed by the standard response criteria used in MF and SS (skin, LN, viscera, blood, global) 
23. 
Response in Skin* 
Complete 
response (CR)  100% clearance of skin lesions# 
Partial 
response (PR)  50-99% clearance of skin disease from baseline without new tumors (T 3) in subjects 
with T 1, T2 or T 4 only skin disease  
Stable disease 
(SD)  <25% increase to <50% clearance in skin disease from baseline without new tumors 
(T3) in subjects with T 1, T2 or T 4 only s kin disease  
Progressive 
disease (PD)♦ (1) >25% increase in skin disease from baseline or 
(2) New tumors (T 3) in subjects with T 1, T2 or T 4 only skin disease or  
(3) Loss of response: in those with CR or PR, increase of skin score of greater than 
the sum of  nadir plus 50% baseline score  
Relapse  Any disease recurrence in those with CR  
*Based on mSWAT score.  
# A biopsy of normal appearing skin is unnecessary to assign a CR. However, a skin biopsy should be 
performed of a representative area of the skin if th ere is any question of residual disease where otherwise a CR 
would exist. If histologic features are suspicious or suggestive of MF/SS (see histologic criteria for early MF7), 
the response should be considered a PR only.  
♦ Whichever criterion occurs first.  
Response in Lymph Nodes* 
CR All lymph nodes are now <1.5 cm in greatest transverse (long axis) diameter by method 
used to assess lymph nodes at baseline or biopsy negative for lymphoma. In addition, 
lymph nodes that were N 3 classification and <1.5 cm in long axis diameter at baseline, 
must now be <1 cm in diameter of the short axis or biopsy negative for lymphoma  
PR (1) Cumulative reduction >50% of the SPD [sum of the maximum linear dimension 
(major axis) x longest perpendicular dimension (minor axis) of each abnormal lymph node at baseline and no new lymph node > 1.5 cm or >1.0 cm in the short axis if long 
axis 1 -1.5cm diameter.  
SD Fails to a ttain the criteria for CR, PR and PD  
PD ♦ (1) >50% increase in SPD from baseline of lymph nodes or 
(2) Any new node > 1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter or >1 cm in short axis 
diameter if 1 -1.5 cm in long axis that is proven to be N 3 histologically or 
(3) Loss of response: in those with PR or CR, >50% increase from nadir in SPD of 
lymph nodes

SD Fails to attain criteria for CR, PR or PD  
PD♦ (1) B 0 to B 2 or 
(2) >50% increase from baseline and at least 5,000 neoplastic cells/μL42 or 
(3) Loss of response:  
in those with CR who were B 1 or B 2 at baseline, increase in neoplastic >1000 
neoplastic cells/ μL or  
in those with PR who were originally B 2 at baseline, >50% increase from nadir and 
at least 5,000 neoplastic cells/μL  
Relapse  Increase of neoplastic blood lymphocytes to ≥B1 in those with CR  
* As determined by absolute numbers of neoplastic cells/uL.  
** If a bone marrow biopsy was performed at  baseline and determined to unequivocally be indicative of 
lymphomatous involvement, then to confirm a global CR where blood assessment now meets criteria for B 0, a 
repeat bone marrow biopsy must show no residual disease or the response should be considere d a PR only.  
# There is no PR in those with B 1 disease at baseline as the difference within the range of neoplastic cells that 
define B 1 is not considered significant and should not affect determination of global objective response.  
♦ Whichever occurs firs t. 
Response in Viscera  
CR Liver or spleen or any organ considered involved at baseline should not be enlarged on 
physical exam and should be considered normal by imaging. No nodules should be 
present on imaging of liver or spleen. Any post treatment mass must be determined to be 
biopsy to be negative for lymphoma  
PR >50% regression in any splenic or liver nodules, or in measureable disease (SPD) in any 
organs abnormal at baseline. No increase in size of liver or spleen and no new sites of 
involvement.  
SD Fails to attain the criteria for CR, PR or PD  
PD♦ (1) >50% increase in size (SPD) of any organs involved at baseline or

*It is recommended that not only the proportion of subjects who achieve a response or an unfavorable outcome be 
calculated but a life table account for the length of the interval.  
After the first documentation of progression, it is at the discretion of the investigator to keep a clinically stable subject on trial treatment or to stop trial treatment until repeat imaging performed at least 28 days later confirms progression. A subjec t with 
unconfirmed  progression of disease may continue trial treatment until progression of 
disease is confirmed  as long as section 5.8
 criteria are met. Subjects with suspected 
pseudoprogression should have biopsy proven confirmation of progression of disease during the 4 week interval between initial demonstration of progression and confirmation of progression of disease. Biopsy findings consistent with pseudoprogression, evidence of a lymphoid infiltrate, necrotic tumor,  without significant increase in viable tumor at site 
of suspected pseudoprogression, may justify continued treatment at the discretion of the PI. 
Subjects may only receive study treatment while waiting for confirmation of PD versus pseudoprogression if th e following criteria are met:  “Section 5.8 Criteria”  
• Absence of signs and symptoms indicating disease progression 
• Absence of rapid progression of disease 
• Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (e.g. , cord compression) 
requiring urgent a lternative medical intervention  
If at the subsequent response assessment a patient is noted to have confirmed, continued, progression of disease by global response criteria, the patient may not continue on MK-3475. 
Disease assessments during the follow-up period is to be repeated every 12 weeks ( ± 7 
days) for subjects who discontinue trial treatment for reasons other than disease 
progression until the subject experiences confirmed disease progression or starts a new antineoplastic therapy. 
Local reading (investigator assessment with s ite radiology reading)  will be used to 
determine subject eligibility and for subject management. Radiologic scans may be sent 
to a central vendor for evaluation.

8511.1.7 Duration of Response
Duration of overall response: The durati on of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or PD  is objectively documented (taking as reference for PD  the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that PD  is objectively documented. 
Duration of stable disease: SD is measured from the start of the treatment unti l the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
11.1.8 Progression -Free Survival  
PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.  
11.1.9 Response Review  
No review of response rate is contemplated.  Investigator determined responses will be 
chronicled.

 This section outlines the statistical analysis strategy and proc edures for the study. If, after the 
study has begun, but prior to the conduct of any analysis, changes are made to primary and/or key secondary hypotheses, or the statistical methods related to those hypotheses, then the protocol will be amended (consisten t with ICH Guideline E -9). Changes to exploratory or other 
nonconfirmatory analyses made after the protocol has been finalized, along with an explanation as to when and why they occurred, will be listed in the Clinical Study Report (CSR) for the study. Pos t hoc exploratory analyses will be clearly identified in the CSR. No separate Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP) will be issued for this study.  
13.1 Responsibility for Analyses  
 The statistical analysis of the data obtained from this study will be the responsibility of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center as part of the Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network (CITN).  
This trial is being conducted as an open -label study ( i.e., patients, investigators, and trial 
personnel will be aware of patient treatment).  
A sin gle interim analysis will be conducted at th e end of Stage 1:  Stage 1 will enroll 9 
patients.   Stage 2:  Will enroll an additional 15 patients (for a total of 24).   If there are one or 
more responses (PR or CR) amongst the nine patients enrolled in Stage 1, Stage 2 enrollment 
will proceed.   If there are no responses (PR or CR) amongst the nine patients enrolled in Stage 1, 
enrollment into Stage 2 will not proceed.  The null hypothesis (H0) MK-3475 will show less than 5% overall response rate.  The alternat ive hypothesis (H1) MK-3475 will show greater than 25% 
 
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date: March 8, 2018 
  
90 
 overall response rate (PR and CR).    
 
13.2 Study Design/Endpoints  
 13.2.1 Primary Objective  
To determine th e clinical efficacy of MK -3475 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory 
MF or SS.  
The primary endpoint will be Objective Response Rate (ORR) as measured by the global assessment standard response criteria for MF and SS [Olsen 2011].
 Response is defined 
as a confirmed PR  or a confirmed CR  with the confirmation assessment  no less than 4 
weeks after criteria for response is first met.   
13.2.2 Secondary Objectives  
To determine the clinical activity of MK -3475 for the treatment of patients with relapsed 
or refractory MF or SS.   
The secondary endpoints will be PFS, DOR, and OS, as measured by the global 
assessment standard response criteria for MF and SS  [Olsen 2011].  PFS is defined as the 
time from allocation to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first.   
13.3 Analysis Endpoints  
 13.3.1 Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints are described below.  
Objective response rate (ORR) : is defined as the proportion of patients who have 
achieved CR or PR according to the global assessment standard respons e criteria for MF 
and SS [Olsen 2011].
  
Progression -free Survival (PFS) : is define d as the time from enrollment to PD or death, 
whichever occurs earlier, based upon investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1. Patients 
without documented PD/death will be censored at the last disease assessment date.  
Duration of response (DOR) : is defined as the time interval between the date of first 
response (CR/PR) and the date of progression. 
Overall survival (OS): is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any 
cause. Patients without documented death at the time of analysis will be censored at the 
date last known to be alive. 
13.3.2 Safety Endpoints The primary safety endpoints are AEs graded using CTCAE (Version 5.0) criteria. Safety will b e assessed by quantifying the toxicities and grades experienced by subjects who 
have received MK -3475 including AEs and  SAEs . Safety will be monitored by 
cumulative data reviews throughout the trial. 
 
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date: March 8, 2018 
  
91 
 Other safety endpoints include laboratory safety assessments, ECOG performance status, 
vital signs and physical examinations.  
Note:  patients discontinuing MK-3475 due to toxicity will still be considered evaluable 
for response.  
13.4 Analysis Populations  
 13.4.1 Efficacy Analysis Population  
The population of eligible subj ects who receive at least 1 dose of treatment will serve as 
the primary population for the analysis of efficacy data in this study.  
13.4.2 Safety Analysis Population The All Subjects as Treated (ASaT) population will be used for the analysis of safety data in this study. The ASaT population consists of all patients who received at least 1 dose of 
study treatment. Patients who do not receive the study treatment will be excluded from analysis.  
At least one laboratory or vital sign measurement obtained subsequent to at least 1 dose of study treatment is required for inclusion in the analysis of each specific parameter. To assess change from baseline, a baseline measurement is also required.  
13.5 Statistical Methods  
 The protocol has a standard Simon two stage design. The null hypothesis that the true response rate is 5% will be tested against a one -sided alternative.  Stage 1  will enroll 9 patients.   Stage 
2:  Will enroll an additional 15 patients (for a total of 24).   If there are one or more responses 
(PR or CR) amongst the nine patients enrolled in Stage 1, Stage 2 enrollment will proceed.  If there are no responses (PR or CR) amongst the nine patients enrolled in Stage 1, enrollment into Stage 2 will not proceed.  The null hypothesis (H0) MK-3475 will show less than 5% overall response rate.   The alternative hypothesis (H1) MK -3475 will show greater than 25% overall 
response rate (PR and CR).  The null hypothesis will be rejected if 3 or more res ponses are 
observed in 24 patients. This design yields a type I error rate of 0.1 and power of 0.9 when the true response rate is 25%.  
Unless otherwise stated, all statistical tests will be conducted at the α=0.05(1- sided) level.  
13.5.1 Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses  
13.5.1.1 ORR  
ORR will be estimated as the number of responders as a percent of the number of eligible participants who received at least 1 dose of treatment . If a 
substantial amount of primary endpoint data are missing (at least 1 value missing from  more than 20% of participants), using nonparametric estimation 
to estimate the ORR requires the missing completely at random assumption may give misleading results. In this situation, analyses of the primary endpoint at the primary time- point will be perf ormed using parametric 
 
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date: March 8, 2018 
  
92 
 generalized linear models fit by maximum likelihood. These methods provide 
unbiased estimation and inferences under the parametric modeling assumptions and the assumption that the missing data are missing at random (MAR). MAR assumes that the probability of an observation being missing may depend upon the observed responses and upon observed covariates, but 
not upon any unobserved factors. A generalized linear model for the objective 
response rate will use a binomial error distributio n. The model will include as 
covariates all available baseline predictors of the missing outcomes.  
Note :  Patients who progress on MK-3475 but remain on study with continued 
MK-3475 therapy will be considered to have progressive disease.  Any 
delayed respo nses with continued therapy in this group will be chronicled and 
reported.   
13.5.1.2 PFS, DOR and OS  
Survival curves for PFS, DOS and OS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.  
For PFS, subjects without documented PD/death will be censored at the last 
disease assessment date. Any subject who is lost to follow -up will be included 
in the analysis and their PFS time will be censored on the last date that the subject was known to be progression free, defined as the date of the last tumor assessment not indicating progression. As a sensitivity analysis the primary analysis of PFS will be performed reconsidering subjects without documented PD or death who discontinued treatment or received new anticancer therapy, to have been progressed at the date of treatment  discontinuation or initiation 
of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs later. 
For OS, subjects without documented death at the time of analysis will be 
censored at the date last known to be alive.  
For DOR, subjects who have not yet progressed by the l ast disease assessment 
will be censored at the last disease assessment ” – this is intended to describe 
censoring rules for the analysis where only responders are used.

 Note:  PD after 1 or more missed visits will be counted as PD as of the date of documented disease progression. An 
additional sensitivity analysis will be performed where subjects with 2 or more missed visits prior to progression 
will be censored at the last dis ease assessment prior to the ≥2 missed disease assessments.  
13.5.2 Statistical Methods for Safety Analyses  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including adverse experiences (AEs), laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG measurements.   
Adverse experiences will be summarized as counts and frequencies by toxicity grade. Summary statistics (median and range) for time to onset of first drug -related toxicity will 
be provided. 
Laboratory assessments, vital signs, and othe r safety endpoints will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics as appropriate.  
13.5.3 Summaries of Baseline Characteristics, Demographics, and Other Analyses  
The number and percentage of subjects enrolled, and the primary reason for 
discontinuation will be di splayed. Demographic variables (such as age) and baseline 
characteristics will be summarized either by descriptive statistics or categorical tables. No statistical hypothesis tests will be performed on these characteristics.  
13.6 Multiplicity  
 No multiplicity adjustment will be applied.  
13.7 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  and Power Calculations  
 This study will enroll between 9 and 24 subjects to receive MK-3475 in a two- stage Simon 
design with 90% power to reject the null hypothesis of a 5% true response rate against a one-sided alternative when the true response rate is 25%. The study will enroll the first 9 patients over a 6 month period, followed by enrollment of 15 more subjects over 10 months.   In the first stage, 9 patients will be accrued. If there are no response s in these 9 patients, further 
enrollment will be suspended. If there are one or more responses amongst the first nine patients an additional 15 patients will be accrued for a total of 24. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 3 or more responses are observed in 24 patients.  This design yields a type I error rate of 0.1 and power of 0.9 when the true response rate is 25%.

 13.9 Interim Analyses  
 
There will be one interim analysis at the end of Stage 1, on the first 9 patients.   If there are no responses in these 9 patients further enrollment will be suspended however patients who are actively being treated on study will continue therapy and will continue to be followed for 
response.  If there are one or more responses amongst the first nine patients we will proceed on 
to Stage 2 and enroll an additional 15 subjects for a total of 24.   
13.10 Compliance (Medication Adherence)  
 
Drug accountability data for trial treatment will be collecte d during the study. Compliance with 
trial treatment administration will be measured by subjects: (1) receiving unscheduled study 
agent infusions/injections; (2) missing an infusion/injection. Numbers and percentages of subjects and infusion/injection visit s with any deviation in these measures will be reported for 
the eligible subjects  
13.11 Extent of Exposure 
 The extent of exposure will be summarized as duration of treatment in cycles. Dose intensity will also be summarized as appropriate.  
13.12 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
 Analysis of secondary endpoints is addressed in Section 13.2
 
13.13 Reporting and Exclusions  
 13.13.1 Evaluation of Toxicity  
All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with MK -
3475. 
13.13.2 Evaluation of Response  
All patients included in the study must be assessed for response to treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible. Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories: (1) CR , (2) PR , (3) SD , (4) PD , (5) early death 
from malignant disease, (6) early death from toxicity, (7) early death because of other 
cause, or (9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data).  
Note:  By arbitrary convention, category 9 usually designates the “unknown ” status of any 
type of data in a clinical database.  
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the exception of those who received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis of the response rate. Patients in response categories 4 -9 should be considered to have a treatment failure 
(disease progression). Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate. Precise definitions for categories 4 -9 will be protocol specific.  
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date: March 8, 2018 
 
95All conclusions should be based on all eligible patients. Subanalyses may then be 
performed on the basis of a subset of patients, excluding those for whom major protocol deviations have been identified (e.g., early death due to other reasons, early discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc.). However, these subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, and the 
reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should be clearly reported. The 95% 
confidence intervals should also be provided.  
 
14. STUDY STATUS UPDATES  AND STUDY CLOSURE  
 
Definitions of Study Status Changes  
14.1.1 Temporarily Closed to Accrual 
 
The study status is Temporarily Closed to Accrual when no patient slots are currently available, but there is the possibility that the trial will re -open for accrual (patient slots 
become available).  Sites are not permitted to accrue additional patients until CTEP is notified of Re- Activation.  
 Study status will need to be changed to Temporarily Closed to Accrual when any of the following criteria are met:  
 
• Sites are notified by CTEP (via Request for Rapid Amendment [RRA]) of changes in the risk/benefit ratio that necessitate changes to the patient Informed Consent docum ent.  Requested changes will be specified in the RRA and must be 
reviewed by the study’s IRB. 
• CTEP and the lead investigator agree that unacceptable toxicities necessitate a 
discussion to change the dosing/regimen. 
• A protocol- defined benchmark has been achieved (such as an interim analysis 
before proceeding to the next stage).  
 
14.1.2 Closed to Accrual 
 
The study status is (permanently) Closed to Accrual when no more patient enrollment slots are available, and at least one patient is still actively receiving the study treatment.  Sites are no longer permitted to enroll additional patients.  
Patient slots are no longer available when the following criteria are met: 
• The pre- specified number of evaluable patients has been successfully enrolled, 
treated, and evaluate d. 
• The study treatment has failed to meet the pre- specified efficacy goal at the stage 
1 interim analysis.  
• CTEP and the investigators agree that unacceptable toxicities preclude further 
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date: March 8, 2018 
 
96enrollment. 
14.1.3 Closed to Accrual and Treatment  
The study status is Closed to Accrual and Treatment when no more patient enrollment 
slots are available and no patients are currently receiving the study treatment.  Patients 
may still be enrolled on the protocol only for the purposes of follow-up. 
Patien t accrual and treatment will be permanently halted when any of the following 
criteria are met:  
• Enrollment was previously closed (study status of “Closed to Accrual”), and no 
patients are receiving the study treatment.  
• CTEP and the investigators agree that unacceptable toxicities preclude further 
enrollment.  In this case, CTEP and the investigators must collaborate to alter the regimen or to halt the study treatment altogether as soon as it can be safely done for patients currently receiving treatment.  
CTEP and Axio must be notified  when patients are no longer receiving treatment [ i.e., 
when the last patient(s) to be receiving treatment is/are no longer receiving the study regimen for any reason].  
 14.1.4 Closed to Follow- Up 
 
The study is considered Closed to Follow -Up when all protocol-defined follow-up 
procedures have been completed for all patients who have not been removed from the study for other reasons.  That is, there are no outstanding follow-up procedures to be performed as mandated by the protocol. 
CTEP does not need to be notified of a status change to “Closed to Follow Up.” 
14.1.5 Complete  
 
Study is considered Complete if it has been at least thirty (30) days since the last patient 
follow-up evaluation.   
A citation to a final study report (manuscript, meeting abstract, etc.) is required with the 
submission of the Protocol Status Update Form to CTEP PIO.   
Responsibility for Filing Protocol Status Update Forms
CTEP must be notified of all study status changes in Section 14.1 (except for Closed to Follow-Up) by the Corresponding Organization via Protocol Status Update Form, available from the CTEP website at http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/default.htm#amendments .    
 
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date: March 8, 2018 
  
97 
 Axio  must be notified as soon as all patients are off treatment ( i.e., when study status changes to 
Closed to A ccrual and Treatment).  Axio  will produce a report within 90 days of this notification.

APPENDIX B  CTEP MULTICENTER G UIDELINES  
 If an institution wishes to collaborate with other participating institutions in performing a CTEP sponsored research protocol that does not  use the CTSU/OPEN rostered model , then the 
following guidelines must be followed. 
Responsibility of the Protocol Chair  
• The Protocol Chair will be the single liaison with the CTEP Protocol and Information 
Office (PIO).  The Protocol Chair is responsible for the coordination, development, 
submission, and approval of the protocol as well as its subsequent amendments.  The 
protocol must not be rewritten or modified by anyone other than the Protocol Chair. 
There will be only one version of the protocol, and each participating institution will use that document. The  Protocol Chair is responsible for assuring that all participating 
institutions are using the correct version of the protocol. 
• The Protocol Chair is responsible for the overall conduct of the study at all participating institutions and for monitoring its progress.  All reporting requirements to CTEP are the 
responsibility of the Protocol Chair.  
• The Protocol Chair is responsible for the timely review of AE s to ensure safety of the 
patients.  
• The Protocol Chair will be responsible for the review of and timely submission of data 
for study analysis. 
 
Responsibilities of the Coordinating Center 
• Each participating institution will have an appropriate assurance on file with the Office 
for Human Research Protection (OHRP), NIH.  The Coordinating Center is responsible 
for assuring that each participating institution has an OHRP assurance and must maintain copies of IRB approvals from each participating site.  
• Prior to the activation of the protocol at each participating institution, an OHRP form 310 (documentation of IRB approval) must be submitted to the CTEP PIO. 
• The Coordinating Center is responsible for central patient registration.  The Coordinating 
Center is responsible for assuring that IRB approval has been obtained at each participating site prior to the first patient registration from that site.  
• The Coordinating Center is responsible for the preparation of all submitted data for 
review by the Protocol Chair.  
• The Coordinating Center will maintain documentation of AE reports. There are two 
options for AE reporting: (1) participating institutions may report directly to CTEP with a copy to the Coordinating Center, or (2) participating institutions report to the Coordinating Center who in turn report to CTEP. The Coordinating Center will submit AE reports to the Protocol Chair for timely review.  
• Audits may be accomplished in one of two ways: (1) source documents and research records for selected patients are brought from participating sites to the Coordinating Center for audit, or (2) selected patient records may be audited on- site at participating 
sites.  If the NCI chooses to have an audit at the Coordinating Center, then the 
Coordinating Center is responsible for having all source documents, research records, all 
 
NCI Protocol#:  CITN -10 
Version Date: March 8, 2018 
  
106 
 IRB approval documents, NCI Drug Accountability Record f orms, patient registration 
lists, response assessments scans, x -rays, etc. available for the audit.  
Inclusion of Multicenter Guidelines in the Protocol 
• The protocol must include the following minimum information:  
 The title page must include the name and address of each participating institution and the name, telephone number and e- mail address of the responsible investigator at each 
participating institution.  
 The Coordinating Center must be designated on the title page. 
 Central registration of patients is required.  The procedures for registration must be 
stated in the protocol.  
 Data collection forms should be of a common format. Sample forms should be submitted with the protocol.  The frequency and timing of data submission forms to 
the Coordinating Center should be stated. 
 Describe how AEs will be reported from the participating institutions, either directly to CTEP or through the Coordinating Center. 
 Describe how Safety Reports and Action Letters from CTEP will be distributed to participating institutions.  
 
Agent Ordering 
• Except in very unusual circumstances, each participating institution will order DCTD-supplied investigational agents directly from CTEP.  Investigational agents may be 
ordered by a participating site only after the initial IRB approval for the site has been forwarded by the Coordinating Center to the CTEP PIO.

APPENDIX C  S TANDARDIZED MEDICAL PHOTOGRAPHY  
 Using a standard medical blue background and with the patient in anatomical position (palms placed anteriorly), the following photos will be taken of the study participant: 
 
1. Global (full body). 
2. Half -global (half body – anterior and posterior aspect). 
3. Additional photographs will be taken at a short distance (1 foot) of biopsy sites.

APPENDIX E  M ODIFIED SEVERITY- WEIGHTED ASSESSMENT TOO L 
(MSWAT)  
 The mSWAT is an objective, quantitative, severity- weighted method to assess the extent of MF 
lesions. A SWAT score is derived by measuring each lesion as a percentage of total body surface 
area (%TBSA) and multiplying it by a severity -weighting factor (1 = patch, 2 = plaque, 4 = 
tumor). All individual numbers are then added to produc e a total score.  
The body is divided into 12 regions with pre -assigned %TBSA based on methodology used to 
assess burns. The extent of skin disease is assessed for each region and quantified by using the subject’ s palm as a “ ruler” to measure the %TBSA involvement within  each region. 
Subject’s palm with 4 fingers, including the thumb and measured from wrist to fingertips, is 1% of TBSA.  
Subject’s palm without fingers is 0.5% of TBSA.

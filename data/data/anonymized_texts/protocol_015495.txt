Treatment 
Description  Plasma Exchange :  
 Seven (7) plasma exchanges of 60 mL/kg, will be performed within 
14 days after randomization.  
 Plasma exchange may be provided by centrifugation or filter 
separation according to local practice and availability.  
 Anticoagulatio n may be provided by heparinization or citrate 
according to local practice.  
 Replacement fluid will consist of human serum albumin (3 -5% 
depending on local availability). Albumin may be combined with 
crystalloid (e.g. saline).  
 Patients with active bleedin g may receive supplemental plasma to 
replace clotting factors according to local practice.

Immunosuppressive and glucocorticoid therapy will be determined by the 
protocol for the first 12 months after trial entry  
 
Glucocorticoids :  
 All patients will recei ve between 1 and 3 g of IV 
methylprednisolone over 1 to 3 days, then daily oral GC.  
 Oral GC may consist of prednisone or prednisolone and 
administered through a weight -based protocol.  
 All participants will receive either 50, 60 or 75 mg/day (based on 
weight) of oral GC for 7 days  
o Participants in the standard -dose group will continue at 50, 
60 or 75 mg/day for 7 additional days and taper to between 
12.5 and 20 mg/day at 3 months and 5 mg/day at 6 months.  
o Participants in the reduced -dose group will continu e at 25, 30 
or 40 mg/day for 7 days and taper to between 6 and 10 
mg/day by 3 months and 5 mg/day by 6 months.  
 All patients will receive 5 mg/day from 6 months to 12 months after 
randomization.  
 
Immunosuppressive Remission -Induction Therapy:  
To consist of  either cyclophosphamide or rituximab, per preference of site 
investigators/patients.  
 
Cyclophosphamide :  
 Participants may be treated with either intravenous (15mg/kg/pulse) 
or oral (2mg/kg/day) CYC according to local preferences.  
 CYC doses will be reduce d for advanced age, poor baseline renal 
function, or cytopenias.  
 
Rituximab : 
 Participants who are prescribed rituximab will receive 4 intravenous 
doses of 375 mg/m ² according to the following schedule:  
o Dose 1 within first 14 days of participation  
o Subseque nt doses: should follow the prior dose by 7 days but 
this may range between 5 and 14 days due to practical 
considerations for arranging rituximab infusions locally.  
o All doses should be given within 42 days of enrollment in the 
study.  
o Note: Rituximab will n ot be given within the 48 hours prior to 
receiving a PLEX treatment.  
 
Immunosuppressive Remission -Maintenance Therapy:  
 
Azathioprine : 
 Participants receiving cyclophosphamide will be transitioned to 
Version 3.1  PEXIVAS  EUDRACT: 2009 -013220 -24 
19 November 2015  
7   
 
azathioprine as maintenance immunosuppression no earlier than 3 
months and no later than 6 months after starting CYC provided a 
remission is induced.  
 Azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day) will begin immediately after the last 
dose of oral CYC or 7 days after the last dose of IV CYC with dose 
reduction for advanced age, cyt openias, or based on TPMT 
genetic/activity testing (if performed).  
 Patients intolerant of azathioprine may use an alternative 
immunosuppressive agent at the discretion of the local investigator.  
 
Prophylactic Therapies :  
Infection prophylaxis such as with  low-dose sulfamethoxazole -trimethoprim 
(i.e. one single strength tablet [480 mg total] daily or one double strength 
tablet [960 mg total] thrice weekly) and osteoporosis prophylaxis. The use 
of prophylactic therapies will be left to local practice and the  discretion of 
local investigators.  
Other Therapies :  
Treatments for AAV not included in the study protocol will not be allowed 
as adjunctive therapies (e.g. intravenous immunoglobulin, anti -TNF alpha 
therapy, high -dose sulfamethoxazole -trimethoprim or oth er 
immunomodulatory treatments).  
 
Sample Size  700 patients .  
 
Primary Analyses   The primary analysis will be of time to the composite endpoint of 
all-cause mortality or end -stage renal disease using log -rank test and 
Cox proportional hazards models, with  survival curves generated 
using the Kaplan -Meier method.  
 
Secondary 
Analyses  1. Sustained remission will be analyzed by comparing the difference in 
proportions (and associated 95% confidence intervals) of patients 
that achieve a sustained remission in each  treatment group.  
2. Death and ESRD will be analyzed separately in an identical manner 
to the composite primary endpoint.  
3. Safety analyses will be performed by assessing the 95% confidence 
interval of the rate difference of serious adverse events between 
treatment groups.  
4. The rate of serious infections will be assessing the 95% confidence 
interval of the rate difference between the treatment groups both for 
the first year and at trial end..  
5. Health -related quality of life using the SF -36 Physical Composite, 
Mental Composite and EQ -5D Index Score will be assessed by 
constructing repeated measures models.  
Safety and 
Monitoring  Adverse events will be assessed at each study visit.  
Important expected adverse events will be actively surveyed (i.e. must 
be assessed to complete the case report form).  
Version 3.1  PEXIVAS  EUDRACT: 2009 -013220 -24

An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)/Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review adverse event data annually or 
more frequently if requested by the DMC/DSMB .

5 Background and Rationale  
 
Granulomatosis  with polyangiitis (Wegener’s)  (GPA ) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are 
syndromes of primary systemic vasculitis associated with anti -neutrophil cytopl asm antibodies 
(ANCA). Together, these syndromes are grouped as ANCA -associated  systemic vasculitis 
(AAV). The prevalence of AAV is estimated at 14 - 30 patients per 100 000 in England (1). Left 
untreated, AAV has a universally poor prognosis with mortality approaching 100% within 5 
years (2). The introduction of treatment regimens based on cyclophosphamide (CYC) and 
glucocorti coids (GC) have transformed AAV from a rapidly fatal disease to one of chronic 
morbidity and reduced survival often preceded by end -stage renal disease (ESRD).  
Plasma exchange (PLEX), a method of rapidly removing potentially pathogenic ANCA and 
other medi ators of inflammation and coagulation, has shown promise as an adjunctive therapy in 
AAV to improve early disease control and improve rates of renal recovery in severe disease. GC 
are a standard of care in the treatment of AAV. High doses of GC early in di sease although 
undeniably reduce disease activity due to their anti -inflammatory and immunosuppressive 
properties also increase the risk of infection particularly in the elderly and in the presence of 
uremia. There is no randomized trial data to guide GC d osing.  
There is a need for therapies with reduced toxicity while improving disease control. Defining the 
role of therapies that are already in use but that are invasive, expensive, but unproven is a 
priority in AAV research. PEXIVAS is a randomized control led trial to test two interventions in 
a two -by-two factorial design (standard care and PLEX compared to standard care alone and a 
standard -dose GC compared to a low dose GC regimen) to address these issues.  
5.1 Target Population  
 
Current standard treatment re gimens still have poor outcomes. Unselected cohorts now 
demonstrate 5 year renal survival (defined as the composite of ESRD or death) of 60 to 70% 
(3;4) . In patients with  vital organ threatening disease (e.g. kidneys or lungs), renal survival is 
worse. Long -term follow -up data from three recently completed RCTs by the European 
Vasculitis Study Group (EUVAS) with 285 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) of less than 50 ml/min/1.73 m2 demonstrated 5 year ESRD -free survival was only 54% 
and the median time to renal failure or death was 6 years despite the exclusion of patients with 
lung hemorrhage (Figure 1). In the subgroup of patients with a creatinin e of less than 500, a 
group traditionally thought to have a favorable prognosis, 33% died or developed ESRD by 5 
years (Figure 2). Additionally, patients with lung hemorrhage, who were excluded from these 
studies, have a mortality of up to 50% in the first  year.

Poor outcomes in AAV are attributed both to ineffective therapies and complications of standard 
treatments, CYC and GC. Approximately 20% of patient s either do not have adequate disease 
control or are intolerant of the ir induction of remission treatment (5-7). An additional 50% of 
patients will have relapsing AAV over the subsequent five years. Inadequate disease control is 
associated with increased immunosuppressive medication and thus increased risk for treatment 
related toxicity and progres sive organ scarring and death. Additionally, between 25 and 50% of 
patients with severe AAV experience a severe infection within the first 12 months of treatment 
and the most frequently cited causes of death are infection or uncontrolled vasculitis (8;9) . 
Treatment regimens that minimize toxicity and infections while providing adequate disease 
control are therefore needed.  
5.2 Plasma Exchange for Treatment of AN CA-Associated Vasculitis   
PLEX removes potentially pathogenic antibodies as well as mediators of coagulation and 
inflammation from the circulation and has been advocated as a method of rapidly controlling 
AAV. Early studies of PLEX in rapidly progressive g lomerulonephritis due predominantly to 
AAV have had mixed results (10-12). These studies had heterogeneous treatment regimens, 
small sample sizes, and short follow -up periods.  
MEPEX examined the effect of PLEX on renal recovery for patients with renal failure due to 
AAV (8). This trial compared PLEX to IV methylprednisolone as an addition to standard therapy 
in 137 incident patients with severe AAV manifested by a creatinine >500 µmol/L or dialysis 
dependency at presentation and demonstrated an absolute reduction in the development of ESRD 
by 24% (95% CI 6.5 – 41%) after 12 mont hs for patients treated with PLEX. There was no 
demonstrable difference in mortality at 12 months between those treated with PLEX compared to 
IV methylprednisolone (mortality of 25% in both groups). Long -term results from MEPEX, 
however, did not demonstrat e a statistically significant difference between the treatment groups 
in terms of ESRD or death (p=0.57) (Figure 3).  
The role of PLEX in patients with less severe renal dysfunction at the time of presentation is 
even less clear. Exploratory work from Jayn e et al found patients with a renal biopsy 
demonstrating active lesions were the most likely to have a benefit from PLEX. In patients who 
do not have advanced, chronic renal injuries, the rapid disease control afforded by PLEX may 
prevent renal (or other v ital organ) scarring and thus the cascade of glomerulosclerosis and 
hyperfiltration that perpetuates renal injury.  
PLEX is also widely used for patients with lung hemorrhage due to AAV. This practice comes 
from cohort data in AAV and experience with anti -glomerular basement membrane disease but 
has never been rigorously tested and in contemporary cohort data appears effective only in 
selected subgroups of patients with lung hemorrhage (13). However, PLEX has the potential to 
exacerbate haemorrhage through removal of clotting factors and increase the risk of infection 
through antibody removal. Its use in this indication demands critical appraisal .

A systematic review of PLEX in AAV identified nine randomized studies. The study populat ions 
were skewed towards severe renal dysfunction and often included diseases other than AAV. A 
meta -analysis of the nine trials that reported death and ESRD outcomes showed a benefit at 
reducing dialysis dependency (relative risk [RR] 0.64; 95% confidence  interval [CI] 0.47 to 0.88) 
but no benefit at reducing mortality (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.43). When considering the 
composite endpoint of death or dialysis the relative risk was 0.81 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.00) (Figure 
4).

5.3 The treatment of ANCA -Associated Vasculitis with Glucocorticoids  
High dose oral GC are the standard of care for the treatment of AAV on the basis of cohort data 
prior to the widespread use of cytotoxic medications and strategies for earlier diagnosis with 
ANCA testing. There is a complex relationship bet ween GC dose and its effects on the immune 
system as an immunosuppressive versus an anti -inflammatory (14). There is also an increasing 
trend to reduce GC doses t o mitigate their toxicity while maintaining efficacy, a trend supported 
by laboratory evidence of a ceiling effect of GC dosing with respect to anti -inflammatory 
properties (15). When combined with cytotoxic medications, high dose GC may significantly 
increase t reatment related toxicity while adding little to therapeutic efficacy.  
Infections in AAV are most common in the first two months of treatment when GC doses are 
highest. Although this relationship is confounded by disease activity and co -treatment with CYC , 
it is important to note that infection rates fall in parallel with decreasing GC dose despite the 
maintenance of constant immunosuppression. Dose dependent increases in infections are also 
observed in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus nephritis (16;17) . Furthermore, high cumulative doses 
of GC are associated with osteoporosis, infections, cardiovascular disease and gastrointestinal 
bleeding (18). Despite the association between higher GC doses and adverse events and despite 
their widespread use, there is a paucity of literature to guide the optimal exploitation of GC in 
AAV.

7  Trial Design  
7.1 Overview  
 
This trial will randomize patients with AAV in a two -by-two factorial design. Randomization to 
each intervention will be in a one -to-one ratio  stratified by the other intervention . Patients will be 
randomized to receive either adjunctive PLEX or no PLEX and randomized to receive either a 
standard GC dose or a low G C dose. All patients will receive standard immunosuppressive 
induction therapy. The primary outcome of the trial will be the composite endpoint of all -cause 
mortality or end -stage renal disease.

7.2 Number of Centres  
PEXIVAS will occur in multiple centres internationally including Europe, North America  and 
Australia/New Zealand. Over 90  centres are planned to recruit patients.  
7.3 Number of Participants  
This study will aim to recruit 700 patients with AAV  over six and half years (6.5) years .  
7.4 Methods to Protect  Against Bias  
Participants will be allocated to the interventions in a one -to-one ratio by a central randomization 
facility utilizing a computerized minimization algorithm. The algorithm will not be made 
available to investigators. 350 patients will receiv e PLEX and be compared to 350 patients that 
do not. 350 patients will receive reduced -dose GC and be compared to 350 patients that receive 
standard -dose GC. Allocation will follow a minimisation scheme (see 7.13.3) based on the 
following prognostic factors  in AAV: severity of renal disease at presentation (requiring dialysis 
or creatinine ≥ 500 µmol/L vs. <500 µmol/L), age (<60, ≥ 60 years old), ANCA subtype (PR3 -
ANCA vs. MPO -ANCA), severity of lung hemorrhage (no hemorrhage, lung hemorrhage with 
an oxygen saturation of ≤85% on room air or ventilated, or lung hemorrhage with an oxygen 
saturation of >85% on room air), and planned induction immunosuppressive therapy to be used  
(oral CYC vs. intravenous CYC vs. rituximab) . 
PLEX is an invasive procedure requirin g the placement of a large central venous catheter and the 
use of a large, complex devi ce with additional monitoring and nursing care. As such, it is not 
feasible to blind either patients or treating physicians to this treatment allocation. There is the 
potential for treating physicians to alter their treatment on the basis of knowing whether the 
patient will receive PLEX. This will partially be controlled by randomly determining their GC 
regimen. Although CYC dosing will be protocol driven, the route of ad ministration will not. The

route of CYC administration, determined before randomization, will therefore be used as a 
stratification variable thus removing some potential for confounding (see 7.13.3 below).   
7.5 Study Duration  
Each patient will be followed unti l study close with a minimum duration of follow -up of 1 year. 
Patient recruitment is anticipated to require 6.5 years. Therefore, the maximum duration of 
follow -up is 7 .5 years. Patients will be followed more frequently when they begin the trial when 
the interventions are most intense and treatment is designed to induce remission of disease 
(Induction of Remission Period) and follow -up will be less intense after this period (Maintenance 
of Remission Period). The patient follow -up schedule is provided below (Tabl e 4). 
7.6 Trial Endpoints  
7.6.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for this trial is a composite of all -cause mortality or end -stage renal 
disease. End-stage renal disease is defined as the requirement of a renal replacement therapy 
(hemodialysis or peritone al dialysis) for at least 12 consecutive weeks or the receipt of a renal 
transplantation. Endpoints will be ascertained at study assessments. In the event a patient does 
not attend an assessment, investigators will attempt to contact any or all of the foll owing: (in 
order) the patient, the patient’s family physician/general practitioner, the patient’s next of kin, 
and the patient’s listed contacts in order to ascertain their endpoint status. In countries with vital 
status registries, we will use the registr y to ascertain missing patient’s endpoint status.  
7.6.2 Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary objectives will be assessed using the following outcome measures:  
 Sustained remission (remission that occurs before 6 months after randomization and lasts 
without a first r elapse until at least 12 months after randomization)  
 All-cause mortality  
 End stage renal disease (ESRD) as described above  
 Serious adverse events defined as any medical occurrence that results in permanent 
disability, hospitalization or the prolongation o f a hospitalization, is life threatening or 
results in death (Section 8. 1.4). 
 Serious infections defined as an infectious syndrome that requires intravenous antibiotics 
or hospitalization for treatment . 
 Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form 36 (SF -36) Physica l Composite Score and Mental 
Composite Score.  
 Euro QoL EQ5D Index score.  
7.6.3 Tertiary Endpoints  
The tertiary objectives will be assessed using the following outcome measures:  
 Estimated glomerular filtration rate (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease four varia ble 
formula)  
 Combined Damage Index  
 Cost-Effectiveness Ratios

7.7 Treatments  
7.7.1 Adjunctive Plasma Exchange Induction Therapy  
PLEX therapy will only be prescribed in addition to standard induction thera py.  PLEX will 
consist of 7 exchanges within 14 days of randomi zation, of at least 60 ml/kg (based on actual 
body weight) per session using albumin (3% to 5% depending on local availability, with or 
without crystalloid) as a replacement solution. The minimum replacement solution volume is 
3000 mL. Intravenous immunogl obulin should not be used after PLEX.  
The following parameters may be determined according to local practice: 1) PLEX may be 
performed by centrifugation or filter separation technique, double filtration apheresis (DFA) is 
not permitted  2) Anticoagulation m ay be provided by citrate or by heparin but it is suggested that 
in patients with active bleeding regional citrate anticoagulation be utilized, 3) PLEX may be 
performed via a central venous catheter if patient is deemed unsuitable for peripheral venous 
access, the latter is strongly recommended, and 4) monitoring of coagulation parameters or 
immunoglobulin levels, and 5) PLEX dose may be reduced for PLEX related complications 
according to local best medical practice and indication and dose alteration noted for future 
analysis.  
7.7.1.1  Patients with Bleeding Risks  
Renal biopsy the day of PLEX should be avoided, to minimize the risk of bleeding from 
dilutional coagulopathy.  
 
Local practice should be followed for patients with active bleeding including patients with 
known pulmonary hemorrhage or a bleeding episode from any source within the 24 hours prior 
to PLEX treatment. This may include fresh frozen plasma at the end of the exchange. This 
information will be recorded in the case report form.  
7.7.1.2  Additional Plasma Exchan ge Treatments  
Patients will not receive additional PLEX treatments for ongoing signs or symptoms of AAV 
(unless they imminently threaten vital organ function – see Major Relapses section 7.9 ), 
serological markers of disease (e.g. elevated ANCA titres), ele vated markers of inflammation, or 
histologic evidence of disease activity. Any PLEX treatments considered outside of the treatment 
protocol should be discussed with the trial medical monitor  and the details must be recorded in 
the patient’s trial case repo rt form.  
7.7.2 Glucocorticoids Therapy  
 
7.7.2.1 Patients Who Have Not Received Any Glucocorticoid Therapy Prior To 
Randomization  
GC therapy shall commence with intravenous (IV) methylprednis olone irrespective of the GC 
group the patient is allocated to. I V methy lprednisolone shall be given as three daily pulse doses  
(minimum 1g maximum 3g, total dose) . Each pulse dose may be between 0.5 g and 1 g at the 
local investigators discretion. The day following the last IV methylprednisolone dose, patients 
will commence t he randomized oral GC regimen (see 7.7.2.5 below).  
 
Version 3.1  PEXIVAS  EUDRACT: 2009 -013220 -24 
19 November 2015  
22   
 
7.7.2.2. Patients Who Have Received <3 g IV Methylprednisolone Within 14 days Prior To 
Randomization  
IV methylprednisolone administered within 14 days prior to randomization will contribute to the 
maximum  allowable dose of 3g. If  <3 g of IV methylprednisolone were given within 14 days 
prior to randomization, participants may receive additional IV methylprednisolone over 3 days 
after randomization to reach a minimum of 1 g and a maximum of 3 g (including a ll IV 
methylprednisolone given within 14 days prior to randomization). The day following the last IV 
methylprednisolone dose, patients will commence the randomized oral GC regimen (see 7.7.2.5 
below).  
 
7.7.2.3. Patients Who Have Received Oral GC But No IV Methylprednisolone Within 14 
Days Prior to Randomization  
Oral GC given prior to randomization do not impact on the protocol GC regimen in terms of 
either IV methylprednisolone or oral GC. These patients should be treated as if they had not 
received any GC prior to randomization (see 7.7.2.1 above).  
 
7.7.2.4 Patients Who Have Received ≥3 g Of IV Methylprednisolone Within 14 Days Prior 
to Randomization  
Patients that have received ≥3 g IV methylprednisolone within 14 days prior to randomization 
should begin the oral GC regimen according to their randomized group within 24 hours of 
randomi zation (see 7.7.2.5 below)  
7.7.2.5. Randomized Oral GC Therapy  
Oral GC therapy shall commence according to previously received IV methylprednisolone as 
detailed in sections 7.7.2.1 through 7.7.2.4 above .  Oral GC therapy will consist of non -enteric 
coated prednisone or prednisolone at equivalent mg to mg doses. Dosing will depend on patient 
weight with three possible weight categories. All oral GC will be given as a single daily dose. 
Patients intolerant of oral medications or for whom oral medications are contraindicated may be 
given an equivalent daily IV dose.  Pre-printed prescriptions for oral GC therapy will be 
provided for each patient in the trial after randomization to ensure adherence to the allocated GC 
regimen.  The standard -dose regimen and reduc ed-dose regimen are summarized in Table 1 . The 
reduced -dose regimen will expose patients to approximately 50% of the standard oral dose over 
the first 3 months and 53% over the first 6 months of treatment. Oral GC therapy will continue at 
a dose of 5 mg/da y until at least week 52 of the study after which GC therapy will revert to local 
practice.  Alternate day dosing regimens (i.e. those that use two different doses on alternate days) 
may be used to achieve the appropriate average daily dose required by the protocol but 
differences in alternative day doses may not be >5 mg. For example, a dose of 12.5 mg/day may 
be achieved by alternating daily doses of 15 mg/day and 10 mg/day.

7.7.3 Cyclophosphamide Remission -Induction Immunosuppressive Therapy  
Standard induction therapy with CYC will be prescribed for at least 13 weeks and no more than 
26 weeks. As the experience of using either oral or intra -venous routes of adminis tration varies 
between centres and there is no apparent  difference in efficacy or safety, the study protocol will 
allow the use of either oral or IV CYC. The CYC regimens will be identical for all treatment 
groups.  
A starting dose of 15 mg/kg/pulse will b e used for pulse CYC (maximum 1.2 g/dose) or 2 
mg/kg/day for oral CYC (maximum 200 mg/day) with reductions made for age and renal 
function in each group according to previous trials conducted in Europe. Oral CYC will be 
administered daily  with the recommen dation for morning administration of full dose, if tolerated . 
Pulse CYC  will be administered IV at a frequency of every two weeks for the first 3 doses then 
every three weeks thereafter  (Table 2) . Modifications to dose and frequency will be made in the 
case of leucopenia.  
For patients undergoing PLEX, PLEX will not occur for at least 24 hours following an IV dose 
of CYC.

For patients receiving PLEX and daily CYC (oral or IV), on days when PLEX is performed, 
CYC will be given following PLEX. PLEX will not be performed for at least 12 hours following 
a dose of oral CYC.  
Full (complete) blood counts will be performe d according to local protocol but the following 
minimum is recommended : patients receiving oral CYC  should have their blood count monitored 
weekly for the first four weeks and weekly for four weeks after any dose adjustment and every 
other week  thereafter.  Patients receiving pulse CYC  should have their blood count monitored 10 
to 14 days after each dose and within 1 day prior to each dose.  
Concomitant use of m esna is optional and left to the discretion of the investigator and local 
practice.  
7.7.3.1  Dosage Modific ations  
7.7.3.1.1  Renal Function and Age  
Starting doses of CYC  should be adjusted for advanced age or reduced renal function. Renal 
function may change over the course of the trial and medication dosages may be adjusted t o 
reflect these changes ( Table 3.) 
7.7.3.1.2  Leucopenia  
 
Oral cyclophosphamide  
Oral CYC  should be held if the total WBC count is <4x109/L. Oral CYC  may be restarted at a 
dose at 25 mg/day less than previous once the WBC count is >4x109 on two consecutive tests or 
>5x109 on at least 1 test. After a n episode of  leucopenia, WBC counts should be monitored at 
least weekly for at least four weeks.  
Version 3.1  PEXIVAS  EUDRACT: 2009 -013220 -24 
19 November 2015  
25   
 
In the case of severe (WBC < 1x109/L) or prolonged (< 4x109/L for >2 weeks)  leucopenia , oral 
CYC  should be restarted at a dose at least 50 mg/day lower than the previous dos e once the 
weekly WBC count permits. In cases of severe leucopenia, consideration should also be given to 
granulocyte -colony stimulating factor (G -CSF), fungal prophylaxis, and other precautions for 
patients with severe leucopenia.  
Patients with a declinin g WBC count but no overt leucopenia (i.e. WBC count <6x109 and at 
least 2x109/L lower than previous) should have their WBC count rechecked within 1 week and 
have their oral CYC  reduced by at least 25 mg/day if the WBC count continues to fall.  
Pulse  cycloph osphamide  
The WBC count should be determined within 1 day prior to an IV pulse CYC . If the WBC count 
is <4x109/L, the CYC  dose should be postponed until the WBC count is >4x109/L and the dose 
should be reduced to 75% of the planned dose (planned dose x 0. 75). 
The WBC count nadir should also be determined 10 to 14 days after the pulse dose is given. If 
the nadir is <3x109/L, the next pulse should be reduced even if the next pre -dose WBC count is 
>4x109/L. For a nadir <2x109/L, the next dose should be 60% of  the previous dose (previous 
dose x 0.6). For a nadir of 2 -3x109/L, the next dose should be 80% of the previous dose 
(previous dose x 0.8).  
7.7.3.1.3  Other Dose Modi fications  
Similar dose reductions to those made for leucopenia may be made for thrombocytopenia and 
anemia at the investigator’s discretion. Dose alterations should also be made in the event of 
infectious complications.  
Table 3. Oral and intravenous cyclophosphamide dose adjustments (mg/kg) for age and renal 
impairment.  NOTE: dose  reductions for renal impairment should reflect renal function at the 
time the dose is given rather than baseline renal function.

7.7.4 Rituximab Remission -Induction Therapy  
Rituximab may be prescribed to patients as induction remission therapy. Rituximab will be 
prescribed as 4 intravenous doses of 375 mg/m ² according to the following schedu le: 
 
1. Dose 1 within first 14 days of participation  
2. Subsequent doses should occur 7 days after the previous dose. Doses may, however, 
occur 5 to 14 days to accommodate practical considerations of administering rituximab 
and to accommodate plasma exchange. A ll doses must be given within 42 days of the 
Version 3.1  PEXIVAS  EUDRACT: 2009 -013220 -24 
19 November 2015  
26   
 
first dose. PLEX should not be given within the  first 48 hours after administering 
rituximab.  
 
Prophylaxis against infusion reactions must be given as 100 mg of intravenous hydrocortisone or 
equivalent with or w ithout an anti -histamine agent immediately preceding the first rituximab 
infusion, and local guidelines should be followed before subsequent infusions of rituximab.  
 
The use of rituximab will not be allowed in Germany for this trial.  
 
7.7.5 Remission -Maintenance  Immunosuppressive Therapy  
Patients who have completed at least 13 weeks of CYC treatment and achieved a clinical 
remission of disease will be converted to maintenance therapy. A clinical remission is defined as 
the absence of disease activity that causes symptoms or signs of active vasculitis  and has a 
BVAS/WG of 0 . Symptoms or signs of disease that are due to the effects of scarring or damage 
caused by vasculitis or are a side -effect of therapy are not considered active disease (e.g. isolated 
persistent p roteinuria or some cases of isolated microscopic hematuria or healing lung 
cavitations). Patients will remain on CYC therapy for no longer than 26 weeks .  
Azathioprine  
Maintenance therapy consists of azathioprine at a target dose of 2 mg/kg/day (rounded to  the 
nearest 25 mg/day)  and will begin immediately after the last dose of oral CYC  or 7 days after the 
last dose of IV CYC . Patients intolerant of azathioprine will be permitted to be maintained on 
either a lower dose or on an alternative agent such as met hotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil at 
their physician’s discretion. TPMT activity or polymorphism assessments may be performed 
according to local availability and practice. Bone marrow and hepatotoxicity should be assessed 
according to local practice but a s a minimum we suggest checking full blood counts and 
aminotransferases every two weeks for the first month of azathioprine therapy and then every 
two months for the first year of therapy and every three months thereafter.  
7.7.5.1  Azathioprine  Dosage Modifications  
The starting dose of azathioprine may be reduced to 1.5 mg/kg/day in patients >60 years old and 
to 1 mg/kg/day in patients >75 years old.  
 
Patients with a WBC count <4x109/L should have their azathioprine temporarily held and have 
their WBC count checked weekly. Once the WBC count is >4x109/L, azathioprine should be 
restarted at a dose of at least 25 mg/day less than the previous dose with continued weekly 
monitoring for at least one month.  
 
Patients with a declining WBC count but no overt leucopenia (i.e . WBC count <6x109 and at 
least 2x109/L lower than previous) should have their WBC count rechecked within 1 week and 
have their oral azathioprine reduced by at least 25 mg/day if the WBC count continues to fall.  
7.8 Guidelines for the Treatment of Resistant Di sease  
Resistant disease is active AAV that does not improve or worsens despite administration of  the 
allocated induction of remission therapy.  
For failure to improve or worsening of nephritis, lung hemorrhage, or other major organ 
threatening disease (neu rological, gastrointestinal, cardiac, eye) within the first two weeks from 
Version 3.1  PEXIVAS  EUDRACT: 2009 -013220 -24 
19 November 2015  
27   
 
entry, we recommend a repeated course of IV methyl prednisolone (1 -3g total dose) or high dose 
oral prednisone/prednisolone (1 mg/kg for 1 week) according to local practice. Oral 
prednisone/prednisolone dosing should return to the allocated tapering regimen at that regimen ’s 
starting dose (i.e. restart tapering regimen).  Consideration of other therapies must  be discussed 
with the medical monitor . 
7.9 Guidelines for the Treatment of Major  Relapses  
A major relapse is new or worsened disease activity that occurs after remission has been initially 
induced  and affects a major item of the BVAS/WG . New or worsening disease activity which 
occurs while the patient is on ≥20 mg/day of prednisone is  considered resistant disease (Section 
7.8).  
For patients who received cyclophosphamide at the start of the study, m ajor relapses may be 
treated with the reintroduction of cyclophosphamide (if it occurs during the maintenance of 
remission phase), an incre ase in the dose of cyclophosphamide if tolerated, rituximab, additional 
doses of IV methylprednisolone (up to 3 g ), an increase in oral prednisone/ prednisolone to the 
same doses used during the initial induction of remission.  
For patients who received rit uximab at the start of the study, m ajor relapses may be treated with 
the reintroduction of rituximab, introduction of cyclophosphamide, additional doses of IV 
methylprednisolone (up to 3 g ), an increase in oral prednisone/ prednisolone to the same doses 
used during the initial induction of remission.  
The use of plasma exchange to treat a major relapse must be discussed with the medical monitor.  
7.10 Guidelines for the Treatment of Minor Relapses  
A minor relapse is new or worsening disease activity that occurs af ter remission has been 
initially induced  that does NOT affect a major item of the BVAS/WG . New or worsening disease 
activity which occurs while the patient is on ≥20 mg/day of prednisone is considered resistant 
disease.  
 
Minor Relapses may be treated with  up to 20 mg/day of prednisone or prednisolone for a 
maximum of 14 days . Following this, if  disease activity is controlled, patients will resume their 
GC regimen starting at the next dose below 20 mg/day. If disease activity is not controlled within 
14 days, patients will be regarded as having a major relapse.   
7.11 Prophylactic Therapies  
Considerat ion should be given to therapies to prevent the complications of treating AAV. This 
includes , but is not limited to , the use of prophylaxis against glucocorticoid induced 
osteoporosis, prophylaxis of Pneumocystis jiroveci  (formerly P. carinii ) pneumonia in fections  
for at least 6 months . Appropriate prophylactic therapy includes sulfamethoxazole -trimethoprim 
as a single strength tablet daily (i.e. 480 mg daily) or a double strength tablet every other day 
thrice weekly (i.e. 960 mg Monday, Wednesday, and Frid ay). The use of prophylactic therapies 
will be left to local practice and the discretion of local investigators. Care should also be taken by 
the investigators to ensure the non -immunologic sequelae of AAV are also treated (e.g. 
hypertension, proteinuria).

7.12 Criteria for Discontinuation  
7.12.1  Individual Subject  
Patients will be withdrawn if they withdraw consent. All other patients will be followed until 
trial termination or death.  
7.12.2  Trial  
Either factor of the trial may be discontinued in the event of clear evidence  of harm or benefit for 
one treatment regimen on the recommendation of the DMC/DSMB and in conjunction with the 
Trial Management Committee. The Haybittle -Peto approach will be used whereby all interim 
analyses use a difference of 3 standard errors (approxi mately p=0.002) as a stopping guideline 
(19;20) . Efficacy and s afety data will be reviewed by the DMC/DSMB on an annual basis.  The 
trial is planned to stop 12 months after the last patient is enrolled (common  closing date).

behalf. Please check your national regulations for further guidance.  
 
7.13.2  Exclusion Criteria  
Patients must have none of the following:  
1. A diagnosis of vasculitis other than granulomatosis  with polyangiitis (Wegener’s)  or 
microscopic polyangiitis

8. Plasma exchange in 3 months prior to randomization  
 
* Patients < 18 years of age will be excluded in Germany  
7.13.3  Randomization  
Allocation will o ccur according to a minimization scheme. Minimization allows the allocation of 
treatments to be balanced for known prognostic risk factors and is particularly useful in small 
trials (<1000 participants) in diseases with many prognostic risk factors (>3).  
The prognostic factors that will serve as minimization strata in PEXIVAS are:  
 severity of renal disease at presentation (requiring dialysis or creatinine ≥ 500 µmol/L  
(5.6 mg/dL)  vs. <500 µmol/L)  
 age (<60, ≥ 60 years old)  
 ANCA binding specificity (PR3 vs.  MPO)  
 severity of lung hemorrhage (no hemorrhage, hemorrhage with blood oxygen saturation 
>85% on room air, or hemorrhage with blood oxygen saturation ≤ 85% on room air  or 
ventilated ) 
 induction immunosuppression therapy to be used (IV CYC vs. oral CYC vs. rituximab).  
 
Participants will be minimized in a one -to-one ratio to each intervention or control group by a 
central facility utilizing a computerized randomization algorithm. Randomization will be 
performed using an internet/world wide web based secure p rogram from the Birmingham 
Clinical Trials Unit. This program will provide the investigator with the patient’s unique trial 
identification number and the allocated interventions. The randomization program will also 
Version 3.1  PEXIVAS  EUDRACT: 2009 -013220 -24 
19 November 2015  
30   
 
inform the responsible PLEX centre, the s tudy pharmacy and the trial coordinator of the patient’s 
identification number and treatment allo cation by email . The minimization sequence will not be 
shared with any investigator.  
7.13.4  Subject Withdrawal Criteria  
Subjects will be withdrawn from the trial at a ny time that they withdraw consent to participate. 
Patients will otherwise be followed to either the trial end or until death. In the event that consent 
to participate is withdrawn, we will request that we be allowed to collect vital status information 
from the patient and/or their family physician or general practi tioner. Subjects who are 
withdrawn will not be replaced.  
7.13.5  Disease definitions  
Granulomatosis  with polyangiitis (Wegener’s)  is characterised by granulomatous inflammation 
of the respiratory tract, together with necrotizing vasculitis affecting small to medium -sized 
vessels  (21). A C -ANCA pattern by IIF with ANCA  specific for antibodies to PR3 , is found in 
over 90% of untreated patients, a minorit y have MPO -ANCA. Diagnosis requires the presence of 
chronic inflammation, with a history of at least four weeks affecting the upper and/or lower 
respiratory tract and not attributable to another cause. The diagnosis may be supported by 
characteristic histo logy, such as a focal, necrotizing, pauci -immune glomerulonephritis; or non -
renal biopsies with an inflammatory exudate dominated by polymorphonuclear leucocytes with 
at least one of (1) necrotizing vasculitis affecting small to medium -sized vessels; (2) e pithelioid 
granulomata; or (3) giant cells; and the exclusion of other causes.  
 
Microscopic polyangiitis is characterised by a chronic inflammatory process with non -
granulomatous vasculitis of small vessels (i.e. capillaries, venules, arterioles or small arteries)  
(22). In contrast to granulomatosis  with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) , granulomatous vasculitis of 
the respiratory tract and/or lung nodules/cavities are absent. Renal involvement is usual and is 
reflected by a focal, necrotizing, pauci -immune glomerulonephritis. Arteritis of medium -sized 
vessels may also occur. Microscopic polyangiitis is associated with MPO -ANCA or PR3 -ANCA; 
minorities are  ANCA negative or recognise other ANCA autoantigens. Diagn osis of microscopic 
polyangiitis requires the exclusion of secondary causes of vasculitis, including drugs, infections 
and malignancy, and vasculitis mimics, such as, anti -phospholipid syndrome and atheroembolic 
disease.

7.14 Screening Evaluation and Informed Consent  
Potential participants will undergo a screening evaluation by a study physician or qualified study 
nurse to determine if the pat ient meets all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria.  The screening visit requires documentation of ANCA results, organ manifestations of 
active AAV, serum creatinine/eGFR result, assessment of treatment with cyclophosphamide and 
glucocorticoids in the last 14 days, assessment of use of dialysis within the last 21 days, a 
pregnancy test where applicable, documentation of pulmonary hemorrhage if applicable, anti -
glomerular basement membrane antibody result, and available pertinent hist ology results.  
 
Informed consent will be sought from all potentially eligible patients. Detailed study information 
will be reviewed with eligible patients or the family or legal guardians of eligible patients that 
are unable to understand the consent proce ss due to medical or mental illness. After disclosure of 
the study details and potential risks and benefits of participating in the study, patients will be 
given adequate time to consider consenting to participate. Patients that partici pate will undergo a 
baseline visit as soon as possible  and will then be randomized . 
Therapy with IV methylprednisolone and/or cyclophosphamide may begin during screening.  
7.15 Baseline Data  
Baseline data will include basic demographic information, laboratory data, and clinical dat a and 
will be collected prior to receiving study therapy. This information will include:  
 Date of birth, sex, limited medical history  
 Medications  
 Height/Weight  
 Disease activity assessment  (BVAS/WG)  
 Disease related damage assessment  (CDA)  
 Serum creatinine/di alysis status  
 Patient self-reported  Short Form 36 questionnaire and EQ -5D questionnaire  
 Biological specimens for biobank  
7.16 Randomization  
Before randomization, the investigator or treating physician must decide on induction treatment 
(i.e., IV cyclophosphamid e, oral cyclophosphamide , or rituximab).  Randomization may be 
performed by the local investigator or other qualified local research staff. Patients will be 
randomized by logging in to an internet based website provided by the Birmingham Clinical 
Trials Uni t (https:// www.trials.bham.ac.uk/PEXIVAS ). After logging in the investigator will 
confirm the eligibility criteria and specify the intended route of cyclophosphamide. The 
randomization algorithm will then assign the patient to either PLEX or no PLEX and to  either 
reduced -dose glucocorticoids or usual dose glucocorticoids and will assign the patient a unique 
trial identification number to be used on all trial related material for the patient. Notification of 
the treatment allocation and trial identification number will be forwarded to the trial coordinator, 
the local investigator and local plasma exchange provider, and the local pharmacy via electronic 
mail (email) upon randomization. In the event access to the internet is unavailable, the 
investigator may ca ll the Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit (BCTU), Tel: 0800 953 0274 (toll free 
in UK, available 9am to 5pm UK time ), or +44 (0)121 415 9137 (from outside the UK, available 
9am to 5pm UK time ) who will access the paper randomization system and inform the

investigator of the treatment allocation and ensure randomization information reaches the 
appropriate study personnel.  
7.17 Induction of Remission  
During remission  induction  (up to 6 months) patients will be seen at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 . During 
these study visits, ba sic clinical and laboratory data will be collected and will include:  
 Medications (including glucocorticoid dose)  
 Disease activity assessment  (BVAS/WG) and CDA (week 12)  
 Serum creatinine  
 Adverse Events  
 Patient self-reported  Short Form 36 questionnaire and E Q-5D questionnaire  (week 12)  
7.18 Maintenance of Remission  
During the maintenance of remission phase patients will be seen at 26, 39, 52 weeks and then 
every 26 weeks. During these study visits, basic clinical and laboratory data will be collected and 
will incl ude: 
 Medications  
 Disease activity assessment  (BVAS/WG, and CDA)  
 Serum creatinine  
 Patient self-reported  Short Form 36 questionnaire and EQ -5D questionnaire  (each visit 
except week 39)  
 Adverse events  
7.19 Termination of Study  
Follow -up for all patients will end o n the common Termination of Study date. If a patient has not 
been reviewed in the last 3 months, they be seen for a final study visit. At the termination of 
study visit, basic clinical and laboratory data will be collected and will include:  
 Medications  
 Disease activity assessment  (BVAS/WG and CDA)  
 Serum creatinine  
 Patient self-reported  Short Form 36 questionnaire and EQ -5D questionnaire  
 Adverse events  
8 Assessment of Safety  
8.1 Definitions  
8.1.1 Adverse event  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical tri al subject administered a medicinal 
product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease  temporally associated with the use of an investigational 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the investigational medicinal product  
8.1.2 Adverse reaction of an investigational medicinal product (AR)  
All untoward and unintended responses to a n investigational medicinal product related to any 
Version 3.1  PEXIVAS  EUDRACT: 2009 -013220 -24 
19 November 2015  
34   
 
dose administered. All adverse events judged by either the reporting investigator or the sponsor 
as having a reasonable causal relationship to a medicinal product qualify as adverse reactions. 
The expressi on “reasonable causal relationship ” means to convey in general that there is 
evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship  
8.1.3 Unexpected adverse reaction  
An adverse reaction, the nature, or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable produ ct 
information (e.g. investigator's brochure for an unapproved investigational product or summary 
of product characteristics (SmPC) for an authorised product).  
 
When the outcome of the adverse reaction is not consistent with the applicable product 
informat ion this adverse reaction should be considered as unexpected.  
 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event. This is not 
the same as “serious,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria.  
8.1.4 Serious adverse event or serious adverse reaction  
Any untoward medical occurrence or effect that:  
- results in death,  
- is life -threatening  
- requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing inpatients hospitalisation,  
- results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity,  
- is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
 
Life-threatening in the definition of a serious adverse event or serious adverse reaction refers to 
an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of event; it does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.

8.3 Recording and evaluation of adverse events  
Non-serious expected or unexpected adverse events, with the except ion of  infections, will not b e 
collected or reported as part of this trial.   
Infections are defined as episodes , which require treatment with intravenous (IV) or oral 
antibiotics or hospitalization,  or infections that are commonly understood to be opportunistic . 
8.4 Recording and evaluat ion of serious adverse events  
Individual serious adverse events need to be recorded by the i nvestigator and reported to the 
Cambridge central study coordinator  for evaluation  immediately, and  within 24 hours of the 
investigator becoming aware of the event . This includes the evaluation of its seriousness and the 
causality between the investigational medicinal product(s) and/or concomitant therapy and the 
adverse event.  
 
The sponsor has to keep detailed records of all SAEs reported to him by the investigator( s´) and 
to perform an evaluation with respect to seriousness, causality and expectedness.  
Version 3.1  PEXIVAS  EUDRACT: 2009 -013220 -24 
19 November 2015  
36   
 
8.4.1 Assessment of seriousness  
Mild:  The subject is aware of the event or symptom, but the event or symptom is easily 
tolerated  
Moderate:  The subject experiences sufficien t discomfort to interfere with or reduce his or her 
usual level of activity  
Severe:  Significant impairment of functioning; the subject is unable to carry out usual 
activities and / or the subject’s life is at risk from the event.  
8.4.2 Assessment of causality  
Probable:  A causal relationship is clinically / biologically highly plausible and there is a 
plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration of the 
investigational medicinal product and there is a reasonable response on 
withdrawal.  
Possibl e: A causal relationship is clinically / biologically plausible and there is a plausible 
time sequence between onset of the AE and administration of the investigational 
medicinal product.  
Unlikely:  A causal relation is improbable and another documented cau se of the AE is most 
plausible.  
Unrelated:  A causal relationship can be definitely excluded and another documented cause of 
the AE is most plausible.  
8.5 Reporting of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs)  
All suspected adverse reactions relat ed to an investigational medicinal product (the tested 
investigations medical products  and comparators) which occur in the concerned trial, and that are 
both unexpected and serious (SUSARs) are subject to expedited reporting.  
8.5.1 Who should report and whom to  report to?  
The chief investigator and central study coordinator (not the sponsor) should report all the 
relevant safety information previously described to the concerned competent authorities and to 
the Ethics Committee concerned. The chief investigator a nd central study coordinator (not the 
sponsor) shall inform all investigators concerned of relevant information about SUSARs that 
could adversely affect the safety of subjects . 
8.5.2 When to report?  
8.5.2.1  Fatal or life -threatening SUSARs  
The MHRA and the Research Ethi cs Committee should be notified  within 24 hours of  
knowledge of the event  but no later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor has first knowledge of 
the minimum criteria for expedited reporting.  
In each case relevant follow -up information should be sought and a report completed as soon as 
possible. It should be communicated to the MHRA and the Ethics Committee within an 
additional eight calendar days.  
8.5.2.2  Non fatal and non life -threatening SUSARs  
All other SUSARs and safety issues must be reported to the compet ent authority and the Ethics 
Committee in the concerned Member States as soon as possible but no later than 15 calendar 
days after the sponsor has first knowledge of the minimum criteria for expedited reporting. 
Further relevant follow -up information shoul d be given as soon as possible.  
Version 3.1  PEXIVAS  EUDRACT: 2009 -013220 -24 
19 November 2015  
37   
 
8.5.3 How to report?  
8.5.3.1  Minimum criteria for initial expedited reporting of SUSARs  
Information on the final description and evaluation of an adverse reaction report may not be 
available within the required time frames for reporting. For regulatory purposes, initial expedited 
reports should be submitted within the time limits as soon as the minimum following criteria are 
met: 
a) a suspected investigational medicinal product,  
b) an identifiable subject (e.g. study subject code number),  
c) an adverse event assessed as serious and unexpected, and for which there is a reasonable 
suspected causal relationship,  
d) an identifiable reporting source,  and, when available and applicable:  
- an unique clinical trial identification (EudraCT number or  in case of non -European  
Community trials the sponsor's trial protocol code number)  
- an unique case identification (i.e. sponsor's case identification number).  
8.5.3.2  Follow -up reports of SUSARs  
In case of incomplete information at the time of initial reporting,  all the appropriate information 
for an adequate analysis of causality should be actively sought from the reporter or other 
available sources. The sponsor should report further relevant information after receipt as follow -
up reports.  
In certain cases, it m ay be appropriate to conduct follow -up of the long -term outcome of a 
particular reaction.  
8.5.3.3  Format of the SUSARs reports  
Electronic reporting should be the expected method for expedited reporting of SUSARs to the 
MHRA. In that case, the format and content as  defined by the Guidance 1 should be adhered to.  
The CIOMS -I form is a widely accepted standard for expedited adverse reactions reporting. 
However, no matter what the form or format used, it is important that the basic information/data 
elements described i n annex 3 of the EU directive, when available, be included in any expedited 
report (some items may not be relevant, depending on the circumstances).  
8.6 Reporting adverse events  
The sponsor is responsible for the prompt notification to all concerned investigat or(s), the 
Research Ethics Committee and competent authority (e.g. MHRA) of each concerned Member 
State of findings that could adversely affect the health of subjects, impact on the conduct of the 
trial or alter the competent authority’s authorisation to c ontinue the trial in accordance with 
Directive 2001/20/EC.  
8.7 Known Potential Risks  
8.7.1 Plasma Exchange  
 
Mortality: PLEX has a reported fatality rate of 1 death per 20,000 exchanges (Canadian 
Apheresis Group, unpublished data). The dominant causes are respiratory  or cardiac 
complications, often attributable to underlying diagnoses such as TTP. Respiratory complications 
include acute respiratory distress syndrome, and noncardiacogenic pulmonary edema (TRALI), 
Version 3.1  PEXIVAS  EUDRACT: 2009 -013220 -24 
19 November 2015  
38   
 
while cardiac complications include arrhythmias and hypo tension. Both respiratory and cardiac 
complications are more common with plasma replacement than albumin replacement fluids.  
 
Coagulation Abnormalities: PLEX with albumin as a replacement fluid decreases clotting 
factors. Prothrombin time may increase 30% and partial thromboplastin time may double. These 
changes tend to normalize within 4 hours after PLEX but may become more long lasting with 
repeated PLEX procedures over a short period. The bleeding risk from the depletion of 
coagulation factors may be inc reased by the use of systemic anticoagulation (e.g. heparin).  
 
Infection Risks: PLEX reduces immunoglobulin levels and may therefore increase the risk of 
infection. This risk is increased by the placement of central venous catheters and concomitant 
renal f ailure. Viral transmission from plasma products may also occur. The risks are largely 
dependent on the local plasma donor population and screening procedures used.  
 
Metabolic:  PLEX procedures utilizing citrate anticoagulation may induce severe hypocalcemi a 
due to the binding of free calcium by citrate. PLEX with citrate anticoagulation may also induce 
metabolic alkalosis when there is concurrent renal impairment, especially if plasma is the sole 
replacement fluid.  
 
Drug Removal: Highly protein bound drugs are significantly removed during PLEX. Drugs such 
as prednisone and prednisolone are largely unaffected but cyclophosphamide (10 -60% protein 
bound) and azathioprine (30% protein bound) may be removed by PLEX. The administration of 
drugs particularly antibi otics and cyclophosphamide after a PLEX treatment may minimize this 
removal.  
 
Complications of Central Line Placement:  CVC placement may be complicated by discomfort, 
bleeding, perforation or dissection of an arterial vessel, air embolism, pneumothorax, 
hemothorax, local infection, or a blood stream infection, or thrombosis.  
 
Hypotension: PLEX may result in a reduction in blood pressure due to a diminished intravascular 
volume. This risk may be slightly higher in machines utilizing discontinuous blood flo w 
technology. Vasovagal reactions, hypocalcemia, and ACE inhibitors may also contribute to 
hypotension.  
 
Dyspnea: PLEX procedures, particularly in patients with renal disease, may be complicated by 
dyspnea due to volume overload. Dyspnea may also occur fr om allergic bronchospasm or non -
cardiogenic pulmonary edema (TRALI) in patients that receive fresh frozen plasma as 
replacement fluid, or from complement activation in machines that utilize bio -incompatible 
membranes.  
8.7.2 Glucocorticoids  
From post -marketing e xperience, the following side -effect incidences are commonly quoted. The 
occurrence of drug reactions is g enerally dose dependent. Table 5 lists additional major reactions 
to prednisolone.

8.7.3 Cyclophosphamide  
 
Serious side effects include infertility, carcinogenesis, mutagenesis and an increased risk of 
bacterial, viral and fungal infections.  
 
Digestive System : Nausea and vomiting commonly occur with Cyclophosphamide therapy. 
Anorexia and, less frequently, abdominal discomfort or pain and diarrhea may occur. There are 
isolated reports of hemorrhagic colitis, oral mucosal ulceration and jaundice occurring during  
therapy. These adverse drug effects generally remit when cyclophosphamide treatment is 
stopped.  
 
Skin and Its Structures: Alopecia occurs commonly in patients treated with Cyclophosphamide. 
The hair can be expected to grow back after treatment with the dr ug or even during continued 
drug treatment, though it may be different in texture or color. Skin rash occurs occasionally in 
patients receiving the drug. Pigmentation of the skin and changes in nails can occur. Very rare 
reports of Stevens -Johnson syndrome  and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been received during 
postmarketing surveillance; due to the nature of spontaneous adverse event reporting, a definitive 
causal relationship to Cyclophosphamide has not been established.  
 
Hematopoietic System: Leukopenia  occurs in patients treated with Cyclophosphamide, is related 
to the dose of drug, and can be used as a dosage guide. Leukopenia of less than 2000 cells/mm3 
develops commonly in patients treated with an initial loading dose of the drug, and less 
frequently  in patients maintained on smaller doses. The degree of neutropenia is particularly 
important because it correlates with a reduction in resistance to infections. Fever without 
documented infection has been reported in neutropenic patients.  Thrombocytopenia  or anemia 
develop occasionally in patients treated with Cyclophosphamide. These hematologic effects 
usually can be reversed by reducing the drug dose or by interrupting treatment. Recovery from 
leukopenia usually begins in 7 to 10 days after cessation of therapy.  
 
Urinary System: Cystitis and urinary bladder fibrosis. Hemorrhagic ureteritis and renal tubular 
necrosis have been reported to occur in patients treated with Cyclophosphamide. Such lesions 
usually resolve following cessation of therapy.  
Infection s: Patients have a reduced resistance to all infections.  
Version 3.1  PEXIVAS  EUDRACT: 2009 -013220 -24 
19 November 2015  
41   
 
Respiratory System: interstitial pneumonitis has been reported as part of the postmarketing 
experience. Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis has been reported in patients receiving high doses of 
Cyclophos phamide over a prolonged period.  
 
Other: Anaphylactic reactions have been reported; death has also been reported in association 
with this event. Possible cross -sensitivity with other alkylating agents has been reported. SIADH 
(syndrome of inappropriate ADH  secretion) has been reported with the use of 
Cyclophosphamide. Malaise and asthenia have been reported as part of the postmarketing 
experience.  
8.7.4 Azathioprine  
The principal and potentially serious toxic effects of azathioprine are hematologic and 
gastrointe stinal. The risks of secondary infection and neoplasia are also significant. The 
frequency and severity of adverse reactions depend on the dose and duration of azathioprine as 
well as on the patient's underlying disease or concomitant therapies. The incide nce of 
hematologic toxicities and neoplasia encountered in groups of renal homograft recipients is 
significantly higher than that in studies employing azathioprine for rheumatoid arthritis. The 
relative incidences in clinical studies are summarized below  and in Table 6: 
 
Table 6 Adverse side effects associated with azathioprine in patients treated to prevent rejection 
of a renal transplant or treated for rheumatoid arthritis.  
Toxicity  Renal Transplant  Rheumatoid Arthritis  
Leucopenia  (any degree)  >50%  28% 
<2.5x109 cells/L  16% 5.3%  
Infections  20% <1%  
Neoplasia/Lymphoma  0.5%  Unknown  
Other Adverse Events  2.8%   
 
Hematologic: Leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia are dose -dependent and may occur late in 
the course of therapy with azathio prine. Dose reduction or temporary withdrawal may result in 
reversal of these toxicities. Infection may occur as a secondary manifestation of bone marrow 
suppression or leucopenia, but the incidence of infection in renal transplantation is 30 to 60 times 
that in rheumatoid arthritis. Macrocytic anemia and/or bleeding have been reported.  
 
Thiopurine S -methyl transferase (TPMT) genotyping or phenotyping can help identify patients 
with low or absent TPMT activity (homozygous for non -functional alleles) who are  at increased 
risk for severe, life -threatening myelosuppression from azathioprine. Death associated with 
pancytopenia has been reported in patients with absent TPMT activity receiving azathioprine. 
Gastrointestinal: Nausea and vomiting may occur within th e first few months of therapy with 
azathioprine, and occurred in approximately 12% of 676 rheumatoid arthritis patients. The 
frequency of gastric disturbance often can be reduced by administration of the drug in divided 
doses and/or after meals. However, i n some patients, nausea and vomiting may be severe and 
may be accompanied by symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, malaise, and myalgias. Vomiting 
with abdominal pain may occur rarely with a hypersensitivity pancreatitis. Hepatotoxicity 
manifest by elevation o f serum alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and/or serum transaminases is 
known to occur following azathioprine use, primarily in allograft recipients. Hepatotoxicity has 
Version 3.1  PEXIVAS  EUDRACT: 2009 -013220 -24 
19 November 2015  
42   
 
been uncommon (less than 1%) in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Hepatotoxicity following 
transplantation most often occurs within 6 months of transplantation and is generally reversible 
after interruption of azathioprine. A rare, but life -threatening hepatic veno -occlusive disease 
associated with chronic administration of azathioprine has been  described in transplant patients 
and in one patient receiving azathioprine for panuveitis. Periodic measurement of serum 
transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin is indicated for early detection of 
hepatotoxicity. If hepatic veno -occlusive disea se is clinically suspected, azathioprine should be 
permanently withdrawn.  
 
Others: Additional side effects of low frequency have been reported. These include skin rashes, 
alopecia, fever, arthralgias, diarrhea, steatorrhea, negative nitrogen balance, rever sible interstitial 
pneumonitis and hepatosplenic T -cell lymphoma.  
 
Serious Side Effects:  
Severe leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, macrocytic anemia, and/or pancytopenia may occur in 
patients being treated with IMURAN. Severe bone marrow suppression may also oc cur. Patients 
with intermediate TPMT activity may be at an increased risk of myelotoxicity if receiving 
conventional doses of azathioprine. Patients with low or absent TPMT activity are at an 
increased risk of developing severe, life -threatening myelotoxic ity if receiving conventional 
doses of azathioprine. TPMT genotyping or phenotyping can help identify patients who are at an 
increased risk for developing azathioprine toxicity. Hematologic toxicities are dose -related and 
may be more severe in renal transp lant patients whose homograft is undergoing rejection. Bone 
marrow and hepatotoxicity should be assessed according to local practice but as a minimum we 
suggest checking full blood counts and aminotransferases every two weeks for the first month of  
azathio prine therapy and then every two months for the first year of therapy and every three 
months thereafter.  Delayed hematologic suppression may occur. Prompt reduction in dosage or 
temporary withdrawal of the drug may be necessary if there is a rapid fall in or persistently low 
leukocyte count, or other evidence of bone marrow depression. Leucopenia does not correlate 
with therapeutic effect; therefore the dose should not be increased intentionally to lower the 
white blood cell count.  
 
Serious infections are a  constant hazard for patients receiving chronic immunosuppression, 
especially for homograft recipients. Fungal, viral, bacterial, and protozoal infections may be fatal 
and should be treated vigorously. Reduction of azathioprine dosage and/or use of other d rugs 
should be considered.  
 
Azathioprine is mutagenic in animals and humans, carcinogenic in animals, and may increase the 
patient's risk of neoplasia. Renal transplant patients are known to have an increased risk of 
malignancy, predominantly skin cancer a nd reticulum cell or lymphomatous tumors. The risk of 
post-transplant lymphomas may be increased in patients who receive aggressive treatment with 
immunosuppressive drugs. The degree of immunosuppression is determined, not only by the 
immunosuppressive reg imen, but also by a number of other patient factors. The number of 
immunosuppressive agents may not necessarily increase the risk of post -transplant lymphomas. 
However, transplant patients who receive multiple immunosuppressive agents may be at risk for 
over-immunosuppression; therefore, immunosuppressive drug therapy should be maintained at 
the lowest effective levels. Information is available on the spontaneous neoplasia risk in 
Version 3.1  PEXIVAS  EUDRACT: 2009 -013220 -24 
19 November 2015  
43   
 
rheumatoid arthritis, and on neoplasia following immunosuppressive therapy of  other 
autoimmune diseases. It has not been possible to define the precise risk of neoplasia due to 
azathioprine. The data suggest the risk may be elevated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 
though lower than for renal transplant patients. However, acu te myelogenous leukemia as well as 
solid tumors have been reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have received 
azathioprine.  
 
Azathioprine has been reported to cause temporary depression in spermatogenesis and reduction 
in sperm viability and sperm count in mice at doses 10 times the human therapeutic dose; a 
reduced percentage of fertile matings occurred when animals received 5 mg/kg.11  
9 Study Risk Assessment  
Data from this trial will be handled by the Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit (BCTU), a full time 
research facility dedicated to, and with substantial experience in, the design and conduct of 
randomized clinical trials. The BCTU is an experienced clinical trials unit that has participated in 
numerous large, multinational studies in the areas of hematology, oncology and renal medicine. 
The BCTU recognizes the responsibilities of a data management centre with respect to the 
ethical practice of research and the adequate protection of human subjects. All BCTU staff 
members are trained and certifie d in Good Clinical Practice standards. Additionally, all staff and 
investigators in this study who contact patients or their data or have the potential to handle 
patient data are required to complete and provide documentation of Good Clinical Practice 
certification.  
 
9.1 Risks to the Subjects  
 
a. Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics : 
The proposed research project will involve 700 adult patients with systemic vasculitis of all 
health statuses. Inclusion criteria includes having a diagnosis of ANCA -associated vasculitis 
(AAV, granulomatosis  with polyangiitis , microscopic polyangiitis) with at least one severe 
manifestation that is either nephritis or lung hemorrhage. Patients with anti -glomerular basement 
membrane disease, other forms of vasculitis, or w ho are pregnant will be excluded. A patient 
who subsequently becomes pregnant during the trial does not have to be excluded provided that 
she remains consented for the trial and that all teratogenic medications are switched to safer 
alternatives, as per cl inical practice. Two interventions are planned in this study in addition to 
standard care; with 50% of patients exposed to each intervention: 1) adjuvant plasma exchange; 
and 2) low -dose oral glucocorticoids.  
 
b. Sources of Materials : 
Medical records will be reviewed for all subjects. Routine physical examinations will be 
performed. The extent of data collection are contained in the protocol. One hundred and twenty  
millilitres in total of extra blood will be taken for research purposes at the same time as r outine 
blood tests during the first year of the study.  .These biomarker samples will be sent on a regular 
basis to the international coordinating PEXIVAS centre at Cambridge.  Only local investigators 
will have access to any identifiable information on stud y subjects.  
 
Version 3.1  PEXIVAS  EUDRACT: 2009 -013220 -24 
19 November 2015  
44   
 
c. Potential Risks : 
The hazards of this trial to patient safety are low -moderate given the experience of the 
investigators with the proposed interventions. These hazards for plasma exchange include the 
risk of adverse events related to central  line placement (some patients may be able to have this 
procedure performed using peripheral intravenous access), the risks of infectious diseases due to 
receipt of a blood product, the risk of hypomagnesemia or hypocalcemia with citrate anti -
coagulation, and the risk of a coagulopathy/bleeding diathesis (Section 8.2 and 8.6.1 ). Of note, 
the serious adverse event rate in a previous trial of plasma exchange in severe AAV was not 
greater than in the group not receiving plasma exchange.  
 
For the reduced -dose GC regimen, these hazards include the theoretical risk of precipitating a 
flare of AAV or delay in the time to remission of their AAV.  
 
In addition, all subjects will experience the potential inconvenience of study appointments. Lost 
school or work time f or both patients and their family members is unavoidable in performing this 
study. However, every effort will be made to perform study visits in an efficient manner and to 
have them coincide with appointments that would be made with standard care to minimi ze the 
excess burden of the study. The medical interviews are not anticipated to be psychologically 
harmful or stressful.  
9.2  Adequacy of Protection Against Risks  
 
a. Recruitment and Informed Consent : 
Recruitment will occur through the investigators’ clinica l practices and from referring 
physicians. The  Ethics Committee/ Institutional Review Board of each participating center will 
approve this protocol as well as the consent forms to be used prior to study start or enrollment. 
Details of the goals of the resea rch and the risk and benefits of the protocol will be reviewed with 
each potential study subject. Recruitment will occur by physicians, study nurses, and research 
coordinators.  
 
Patients who decline to participate in any or all parts of the study will stil l have available the 
opportunity of evaluation by a vasculitis expert if they or their physician feels this is appropriate.  
 
Strict patient confidentiality will be observed throughout all aspects of the study. While medical 
records will be reviewed by memb ers of the research team, no individually identifiable patient 
data will be distributed to non -research or care -giving team members.  BUT the onsite monitor 
could have access to identifiable patient info during inspections.  
 
In the event of adverse effects from the study, the full resources of the hospital will be available 
to intervene as medically necessary.  Licensed physicians expert in the care of patients with 
vasculitis are available at all times at each study site.  
 
9.3 Potential Benefits of the Proposed  Research to the Subject and Others  
As described above, the potential risks to the study subjects in participating in this study are low -
moderate. Participants in this study are unlikely to gain direct benefit from participation. If the 
study leads to high er quality care or therapeutic trials for vasculitis then study patients could 
Version 3.1  PEXIVAS  EUDRACT: 2009 -013220 -24

45   
 
theoretically benefit in the future. All subjects will potentially have the satisfaction of helping to 
contribute to medical knowledge of vasculitis. Further understanding of bo th the clinical and 
molecular aspects of vasculitis is of great medical importance and because progress in 
understanding these diseases is expected from this study it is felt that the potential benefits of this 
research outweigh the risks of participation.  
9.4 Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained  
Knowledge to be gained from this study will be highly important. The optimization of treatment 
strategies for patients with severe AAV has the potential to dramatically and directly affect 
clinical practice and pat ient outcomes. This is underscored by the current widely varied practice 
patterns regarding use of plasma exchange technology and the consistently poor outcomes of the 
AAV patient population. Furthermore, the relative rarity of patients with AAV has tradit ionally 
made it difficult to collect high quality data on interventions that affect hard, clinical endpoints. 
This trial would also allow a unique perspective on the pathogenesis of AAV given the novel 
mechanism of action of the plasma exchange therapy.  
10 Study Monitoring  
 
PEXIVAS will employ central statistical monitoring of data. This monitoring process will be 
applied by the Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit. Trial sites identified by the central statistical 
monitoring process as having outlying data or tha t have extensive quality control issues will 
undergo on -site monitoring. Additional sites will undergo random on -site monitoring on a 
periodic basis.  
11 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee/ Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DMC/ DSMB) 
will be established for this trial and will include at least one member from each of the following 
designations: a statistician, an expert in vasculitis and an expert in trial methodology. The 
DMC/ DSMB will meet annually to review all collected data and may meet more frequently if 
required after analysis of the available data. The DMC/ DSMB will advise the Trial Management 
Committee and the independent Trial Steering Committee on the safety of continuing this 
clinical trial. A report from each mee ting of the DMC/ DSMB will be forwarded to each 
Institutional Review Board at each participating center.  
 
All unexpected serious adverse events will be reported to the Trial Management Committee and 
the trial Sponsors (the Cambridge University Hospitals NH S Foundation Trust) by facsimile 
within 24 hours of knowledge of their occurrence by local investigators. The receipt of all 
serious adverse events must be acknowledged by the Sponsor and the Sponsor must forward 
notification of all serious events to the r esponsible authorities of participating countries within 7 
days of the initial notification. All other serious adverse events must be reported to the Sponsor 
and the Trial Management Committee within 14 days of knowledge of their occurrence by the 
local in vestigator. The Sponsor will process, record and report these serious adverse events and a 
report will be forwarded to the responsible regulatory agency of each participating country and 
the local institutional review boards of each participating center in  the United States annually. A 
listing of all suspected serious adverse reactions will also be made available globally as per 
Version 3.1  PEXIVAS  EUDRACT: 2009 -013220 -24 
19 November 2015  
46   
 
European law. All data regarding the occurrence of serious adverse events will be made available 
to the DMC/ DSMB for review.  
12 Stati stical Considerations  
12.1 Sample Size Estimation  
The sample size for this trial is event driven in order to detect a hazard ratio of 0.64 (PLEX 
versus no PLEX) with 80% power and a two sided alpha of 0.05. Protocol versions 1.0 and 2.0 
estimated a required sam ple size of 500 predicting  164 even ts over the study period equivalent to 
a 12% absolute risk reduction of the primary endpoint at five years  - 44% in the cont rol group vs. 
32% in PLEX group (overall 38%) . This sample size estimate assume d a five year medi an time 
to ESRD or death on the basis of previous extended follow -up studies in randomized trials of 
AAV of a similar severity to those targeted in this study (Figure 1). Review of PEXIVAS event 
rates in 2014 indicates a two year event rate of 24% and pred icted overall five year event rate of 
30-35%. Improvements in death and ESRD have been recently reported in registry studies. In 
order to obtain the required number of events the sample size needs to be increased to 675 -725 
patients allowing a 10% loss to follow -up in or cross over between treatment groups.  The trial 
now plans to enroll 700 patients over a six and a half year period with a minimum of one year of 
follow -up and therefore a maximum follow -up of seven and a half years  in order to observe at 
least 160 events . These calculations assume no significant interaction between the two treatment 
factors. Although this absolute risk appears larger than is often clinically significant, the 
expensive and invasive nature of the primary intervention, PLEX warr ants a relatively large 
effect size. Additionally, this effect size is close to the estimated effect of PLEX in the meta -
analysis of prior studies (80% power to detect a relative risk reduction of 27% with our sample 
size compared to a relative risk reduct ion of 20% in the meta -analysis).  
While this effect size appears reasonable to detect for PLEX, it is unlikely a reduction in GC will 
result in a 12% absolute risk reduction of death or dialysis. However, we expect approximately 
25% of patients to experien ce a severe infection based on prior studies. A sample size of over 
700 patients will allow 80% power to detect at least a 10% absolute risk reduction in severe 
infections (relative risk reduction of severe infection by 40%), a finding of clinical signific ance. 
In terms of the non -inferiority hypothesis, a sample size of 700 patients would allow >80% 
power to ensure that the reduced -dose GC regimen results in an increase in ESRD or death by no 
more than 11% (one -sided alpha of 0.05).  
12.2 Planned Analyses  
12.2.1  Interi m Analyses  
Interim analyses  of efficacy and safety are planned annually .  The Haybittle -Peto approach will 
be used whereby all interim analyses use a difference of 3 standard errors (approximately 
p=0.002) as a stopping guideline. Safety data will be revie wed by the DMC/DSMB on an annual 
basis or more frequently if required by the DMC/DSMB or Trial Management Committee.  
12.2.2  Primary Endpoint Analyses  
The final analysis of all trial data will occur one years after the final patient is enrolled.  
The primary analys is for this study will be a comparison between groups of time -to the 
development of ESRD or death by any cause. The primary comparison groups will be composed 
of those treated with PLEX to those not treated with PLEX (comparison 1) and those treated with 
Version 3.1  PEXIVAS  EUDRACT: 2009 -013220 -24 
19 November 2015  
47   
 
a reduced -dose GC regimen to those treated with a standard -dose (comparison 2). A test for 
interaction between treatments will be performed but will be interpreted cautiously. It is 
anticipated that the randomization/minimization strategy will be successful  and the primary 
analysis can be conducted with a simple log -rank test. Kaplan -Meier survival curves will be 
constructed for visual analysis of time -to-event comparisons. In the event that important co -
variables are unbalanced between groups, a Cox proport ional hazards or an extended Cox model 
to account for any difference s. The primary analysis will be based on the intention to treat 
principle , with all patients analysed in the arms to which they were allocated irrespective of 
compliance with the allocated  treatment . For all tests, 95% confidence intervals will be 
constructed where appropriate and a p -value of <0.05 will be considered significant. No 
corrections for multiple tests will be made.  
 
There is a risk of cross -over of patients randomized to not re ceive PLEX to the PLEX arm, 
although this practice will be discouraged and any such decision on protocol -defined parameters. 
The primary intention to treat analysis will deal with this cross -over in a conservative manner 
(bias to the null). To explore the potential that this cross -over may reduce the true magnitude of 
effect of PLEX, secondary analyses will be performed. Secondary analyses will therefore also 
include a per protocol analysis where patients are classified with respect to the intervention they  
ultimately received rather than the intervention they were randomized to. For the purpose of this 
analysis, patients will be regarded as having received PLEX if they received at least one 
complete exchange. Patients will be regarded as receiving the stand ard-dose of GC if they 
receive at least 70% of the cumulative dose of the standard regimen in the first 6 months of 
therapy. Patients will be regarded as receiving the reduced -dose of GC if they receive no more 
than 130% of the cumulative doses of the reduced-dose regimen in the first 6 months of therapy. 
Secondary analyses will not, irrespective of their differences from primary analyses, supplant the 
planned primary analyses.  
12.2.3  Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
12.2.3.1  Sustained Remission  
Disease activity will be analyze d in terms of sustained remissions. Patients will have obtained a 
sustained remission if they achieve a BVAS/WG of zero (complete remission) within 26 weeks 
of randomization and maintain a BVAS/WG of zero from complete remission until at least 52 
weeks aft er randomization. The proportion of patients that achieve a sustained remission will be 
calculated and an absolute risk difference and relative risk with the associated 95% confidence 
interval will be calculated.  
12.2.3.2  Death and ESRD  
Death and ESRD will be anal yzed as separate endpoints in a manner identical to primary 
composite endpoint.  
12.2.3.3  Quality of Life Measures  
Quality of life data will be analyzed using mixed effect repeated measures  with the interventions 
specified as independent variables.  
12.2.3.4  Serious Adverse Events  
The proportion of patients that experience at least one  serious adverse event  will be analyzed as a 
categorical variable by intervention utilizing a Fisher’s exact test . If appropriate, a  more complex 
Version 3.1  PEXIVAS  EUDRACT: 2009 -013220 -24 
19 November 2015  
48   
 
model of serious adverse event occurrences will be constructed utilizing adverse events as count 
variables.  
An analysis of major subgroups of adverse events will be performed separately but in an 
identical manner as the overall adverse events analyses (e.g. infections, malignancy, 
cardiovascular compli cations).  
12.2.4  Tertiary Endpoint Analyses  
12.2.4.1  Renal Function  
Renal function will be compared between groups using serial estimated glomerular filtration 
rates as the outcome in longitudinal panel data analysis with the intervention as an independent 
variable. Patie nts who reach ESRD will be considered to have an estimated glomerular filtration 
rate of zero.  
12.2.4.2  Economic Analyses  
An economic evaluation will be conducted in order to estimate whether it is cost -effective to 
provide PLEX, in addition to standard care, for severe AAV. Additionally, the cost -effectiveness 
of low dose GC, compared to high dose GC, will also be estimated.  
The health care costs for each patient will be estimated by monitoring the resource use for each 
patient and assigning appropriate unit costs  to these resource items. This will enable the total 
treatment cost to be identified for each patient, along with the mean cost of each of the treatment 
regimes.  
The main measures of effectiveness within the economic analysis will be the level of mortality  
and ESRD, along with the EQ -5D. This will enable the overall treatment effect to be estimated 
for each patient as well as the mean level of effectiveness for each treatment regime.  Cost 
effectiveness will be determined by estimation of incremental cost -effectiveness ratios and cost 
effectiveness acceptability curves.  
    
12.2.4.3  Planned Subgroup Analyses  
Several a priori subgroup analyses are planned with respect to both primary and secondary 
outcomes. The subgroups will be  each strata included for minimization. S ubgroup analyses will 
employ a test of interaction to explore whether there is evidence that the treatment effect differs 
across subgroups .  
13 Biomedical Substudies  
Biomedical substudies are anticipated for the PEXIVAS Trial. Study sites will not all partici pate 
in all substudies.  The organization of Biomedical Substudies will be coordinated by the 
Biomedical Substudy Committee. Consent for the procurement of biological specimens for use 
by an international team will be obtained during the consent procedure f or the trial. Sites may opt 
out of participating in biomedical substudies but still participate in the clinical trial. Biological 
specimens considered may include DNA, RNA, plasma, and renal biopsy specimens.

14 Ethical Considerations  
14.1 Evaluation of Risks to P atients  
Medical records will be reviewed for all subjects and routine physical examinations will be 
performed. No specimens will be collected that are not considered the current standard of care. 
Specimens will be handled locally unless otherwise indicated . Only local investigators will have 
access to any identifiable information on study subjects.  
The hazards of this trial to patient safety are low -moderate given the experience of the 
investigators with the proposed interventions. These hazards for plasma exchange include the 
risk of adverse events related to central line placement (some patients may be able to have this 
procedure performed using peripheral intravenous access), the risks of infectious diseases due to 
receipt of a blood product, the risk of hypomagnesemia or hypocalcemia with citrate anti -
coagulation, and the risk of a coagulopathy/bleeding diathesis (See Section 8 above for details). 
Of note, the serious adverse event rate in a previous trial of plasma exchange in severe AAV was 
not greater than in the group  not receiving plasma exchange.  
For the reduced -dose GC regimen, these hazards include the theoretical risk of precipitating a 
flare of AAV or delay in the time to remission of their AAV. In the event of excess disease 
activity, the trial protocol allows for additional glucocorticoid treatment in order to regain control 
of the patient’s disease.  
In addition, all subjects will experience the potential inconvenience of study appointments. Lost 
school or work time for both patients and their family members is unavoidable in performing this 
study. However, every effort will be made to perform study visits in an efficient manner and to 
have them coincide with appointments that would be made with standard care to minimize the 
excess burden of the  study. The medical interviews are not anticipated to be psychologically 
harmful or stressful.  
14.2 Protection Against Risks  
Recruitment will occur through the investigators’ clinical practices and from referring 
physicians. The Institutional Review Board of e ach participating center will provide ethical 
review and approval for this protocol as well as the consent forms to be used prior to study start 
or enrollment. Details of the goals of the research and the risk and benefits of the protocol will be 
reviewed with each potential study subject. Recruitment will occur by physicians, study nurses, 
and research coordinators.  
Patients who decline to participate in any or all parts of the study will still have available the 
opportunity of evaluation by a vasculitis e xpert if they or their physician feels this is appropriate.  
Strict patient confidentiality will be observed throughout all aspects of the study. While medical 
records will be reviewed by members of the research team, no individually identifiable patient 
data will be distributed to non -research or care -giving team members.  
In the event of adverse effects from the study, the full resources of the hospital will be available 
to intervene as medically necessary.  Licensed physicians expert in the care of patient s with 
vasculitis are available at all times at each study site.

14.3 Potential Benefits to Participants  
As described above, the potential risks to the study subjects in participating in this study are low -
moderate. Participants in this study are unlikely to ga in direct benefit from participation. If the 
study leads to higher quality care or therapeutic trials for vasculitis then study patients could 
theoretically benefit in the future. All subjects will potentially have the satisfaction of helping to 
contribute  to medical knowledge of vasculitis. Further understanding of both the clinical and 
molecular aspects of vasculitis is of great medical importance and because progress in 
understanding these diseases is expected from this study it is felt that the potentia l benefits of this 
research outweigh the risks of participation.  
14.4 Trial Ethical Approval  
Each national coordinator or local coordinator will apply for national or regional ethics approval 
as well as regulatory approval (e.g. MHRA, Health Canada etc).  
Intern ational sponsorship will be provided by the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS 
Foundation Trust upon signing of the site agreement with each trial site. Site agreements will be 
contingent upon the provision of evidence that study personnel have completed G ood Clinical 
Practice training.  
14.5 GCP Statement  
This clinical trial will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their 
origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, and that are consistent with Good Clinical Practice and all 
applicable reg ulatory requirements.

Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score Modified for Wegener’s Granulomatosis (BVAS/WG)  
 
An Introduction and Glossary of Terms  
 
Purpose of assessment  
 
BVAS/WG is designed to document clinical features that are directly due to active  WG or 
MPA (AAV).  In addition, the instrument separates the features that represent new or worse 
disease activity from those that represent persistent activity.  In scoring  BVAS for WG, it is very 
important not to confuse activity  with damage .  Damage, defined as the presence of non -healing 
scars, and is a concept distinct from current disease activity.  Damage will be scored separately in 
PEXIVAS using another index, the Co mbined Damage Assessment (CDA), which is not the 
subject of this exercise.  
 
Recording disease activity  
 
The list of items in BVAS/WG includes clinical symptoms and signs, as well as information 
obtained from additional tests (e.g., chest x -rays) or subspec ialty consultations.  When using the 
BVAS/ WG evaluation form, one scores only these items attributable to currently active WG (after 
the exclusion of obvious causes such as infection, hypertension, and treatment toxicity).  BVAS 
scores may vary rapidly, a nd reflect the need for therapy.  
 
New Patients  
 
If the patient is being evaluated for the first time and has not been treated, all of the abnormalities 
noted should be recorded as NEW/WORSE ( ) regardless of their duration.  After going through 
the entir e items list, also remember to consider adding any other significant items to the “Other” 
section, if relevant.  A list of “Other” items that might be included in these sections is displayed at 
the end of the glossary.  If a section has no items present, c heck the “none” box.  
 
Follow -up Patients  
 
If the patient is being evaluated in follow -up, there may be some abnormalities that are NEW or 
WORSE ( ) within the previous 28 days.  Other abnormalities may have been present on the 
previous assessment and are neither new nor worse, but rather still present (PERSISTENT 
 ).  By 
making this distinction, one differentiates new, acute disease activity from persistent disease 
activity.   It is important to remember that persistent  activity is activity , not damage.  Thus, 
persistent purpura should be scored as activity.  In con trast, weakness from mononeuritis multiplex 
of 4 months duration is damage, and should not be scored in BVAS.   Sometimes (admittedly), it is 
difficult to be certain whether a symptom or sign is due to persistent activity or to damage.  As in 
caring for rea l patients, in evaluating such cases one relies on clinical judgement to make this 
distinction.  
 
Checking the boxes  
 
Version 3.1  PEXIVAS  EUDRACT: 2009 -013220 -24 
19 November 2015  
56   
 
Check one of the boxes for each item (  or 
) only if the abnormality is ascribed to the 
presence of active WG.  If no abnormalities ascribable to WG are present in a given organ 
system, check the “none” box.  In this way, we can be certain that you did not overlook an 
organ system on the scoring  
 
sheet.  Sometimes you will have patients in whom abnormalities are present that are not due to 
AAV (e.g., hematuria due to urinary infection or cyclophosphamide toxicity).  In these cases, 
you should NOT record them in the BVAS/WG list, even though they a re present, because they 
cannot be ascribed to active AAV.  In some patients, abnormalities that were due to previous 
episodes of WG may still be evident, even though the disease is entirely inactive (e.g., stroke).  
These features should also NOT be recor ded on BVAS/WG, since they represent non -healing 
scars (damage).  
 
 Check this box only if the abnormality is NEW/WORSE  within the previous 28 days 
(unless this is the first presentation of untreated disease).  
 Check this box only if the abnormality is PE RSISTENT  since the last assessment and not  
worse within the previous 28 days.  
( ) Check this space if there is not a single major or minor item that is new/worse within a 
particular organ system.  
 
Necessity for “Judgement Calls”  
 
As in clinical practice, one must sometimes make “judgement calls” in scoring BVAS/WG.  
For example, persistent sinus symptoms are often notoriously difficult to classify with certainty 
as either active disease or permanent damage.  Similarly, small amounts of hematuria (usually 
with RBC casts) may persist for months in patients whose disease is otherwise quiescent.  In 
both such cases, the physician is unlikely to intensify treatment in the absence of other 
indications of active disease.  For this reason, these findings (and analo gous findings in other 
organ systems) should not be scored in BVAS/WG.  If subsequent events cause you to re -
consider your judgement call, you may go back and change your initial decision regarding a 
particular finding.  
 
You will note that for some feature s (e.g., sensorineural deafness, most of the neurological 
items) there is no persistent box.  This reflects the fact that if these features are present, they are 
new/worse by definition.  If the feature is still present at subsequent assessments — as 
monon euritis multiplex is likely to be — the feature is (by definition) damage, and should not 
be scored.  
 
Recording Major and Minor Items  
 
Individual items are defined as Major by the presence of an asterisk (*).  All other items are 
defined as Minor.  If you list additional items in the “Other” section, you should indicate whether 
the item is “Major” or “Minor”.  In general, a Major item is one whose presence would have 
traditionally prompted the use of cyclophosphamide.   Minor items are those more likely to b e 
treated with methotrexate or an increase in prednisone.

If you decide that a particular abnormality is due to the presence of active WG, you must 
distinguish problems that are new/worse from those problems that are persistent.  For each item 
where there  is an abnormality, you need to check either the NEW/WORSE box or the 
PERSISTENT box, but not both.  
 
 
 
 
Summing Up BVAS/WG  
 
Now add up all of the Major (*) items marked in the New/Worse column, and enter the sum in the 
appropriate box on the right side of the page.  Repeat this for the Minor items in the 
NEW/WORSE column, and then do the same for the Major and Minor items in the Persistent 
column.  
 
Defining disease status  
 
Severe disease/flare: If any Major item is recorded, the patient has a “Severe Flare” .   
Limited disease/flare: If any Minor item is recorded, the patient has a “Limited Flare”.  
Persistent Disease:  Persistent disease indicates the presence of 1 or more persistent items 
attributed to active disease.  
Remission: Remission indicates no active disease (i.e., no new/worse and no persistent items 
present).  
 
Physician’s Global Assessment  
 
Finally, use the 10 point likert scale to record your assessment of the overall disease activity in this 
case.  Remember that you should not be influenced by the presence of any accumulated damage, 
complication of treatment, social/emotional problems, or other issues not related to active 
vasculitis.  
 
 
BVAS/WG  
 
GLOSSARY OF TERMS  
 
GENERAL RULE: Disease features are scored only when they are attributable to active  
WG/MPA, after exclusion of other obvious causes (e.g., infection, hypertension, toxicity of 
treatment, etc.).  THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF SCORING TO 
REMEMBER!  
 
If the patient is presenting for the first time and has not been treated, then all items  due to WG that 
is currently active are defined as NEW/WORSE, regardless of how long the patient has had them.     
 
If an item is new or represents a deterioration of status occurring in the previous 28 days, it is 
scored in the NEW/WORSE box.   
Version 3.1  PEXIVAS  EUDRACT: 2009 -013220 -24 
19 November 2015  
58   
 
 
If the fea ture was present at the previous evaluation and is not new or worse but still represents 
ongoing disease activity, record it as PERSISTENT.  
 
Check box (  or 
) only if the abnormality is ascribable to the presence of active WG.  
 
 Check this circle only if the abnormality is NEW/WORSE  within the previous 28 days.  
 Check this box only if the abnormality is PERSISTENT  since the last assessment and not  
worse wi thin the previous 28 days.  
 
For some features, further information (e.g., a chest radiograph or subspecialty consult) may be 
required to determine if an abnormality is new or worse.  
 
Glossary definitions used in BVAS/WG  
 
Remember that for most patients, you will be able to complete the BVAS evaluation form on the 
same day you evaluate the patient.  However, on other occasions, you may require further 
information before entering some items.  For example, if the patient has new onset of stridor, you 
would u sually ask an ENT colleague to investigate this further to determine whether or not it is 
due to active WG.  We suggest that you leave such items blank temporarily, but complete them 
once the information is available.

To help people s ay how good or bad their state of health is, we  
have drawn a scale (rather like a thermometer) on which the 
best state you can imagine is marked 100 and the worst state 
you can imagine is marked 0.  
  
We would like you to indicate on this scale how good o r bad 
your  
own health is today, in your opinion. Please do this by drawing a  
line from the box below to whichever point on the scale indicates  
how good or bad your state of health is today.

18.5 Modification of Diet in Re nal Disease (MDRD) Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate 
Calculation  
 
The four variable MDRD equation is:  
 
GFR = 186 x Scr -1.154 x age -0.203 x 1.210 if black x 0.742 if female  
 
Note 1: serum creatinine (Scr) is given in mg/dl (divide by 88.4 to convert to  µmol/L) and age is 
given in years.  
 
Note 2: Use multiplier of 175 instead of 186 if sCr was IDMS -standardized. IDMS = isotope 
dilution mass spectrometry . 
 
A free on -line calculator (available for serum creatinine in mg/dL or µmol/L) is available at:

4. Abstract 
Title : Study of Iodinated contrast agents and risk of hypothyroidism in young children in the 
United States 
 
Rationale and background:   While it is generally known and acknowledged that exposure to 
iodi
ne contrast can interfere with thyroid function, little is known about the incidence of iodine-
induced hypothyroidism in young children (under age 4).  
Research question and objectives:  The goal of this study is to estimate the incidence rate of 
de
tected hypothyroidism in a US-based general population of patients less than 4 years of age 
during
 years 2008 - 2015, who were exposed to an iodinated contrast agent.  
Stud
y design: This will be a retrospective cohort study.  
Population: Patients less than age 4 in the US-based Kaiser Permanente Northern Cali fornia  
data during years 2008 through 2015 
Var
iables:  Age, sex, calendar year, diagnostic procedure, comorbidities, treatments  
Dat
a sources:  Kaiser Permanente Northern California  database 
Study size: There are  millions patients under age 4 in the K aiser Permanente Northern 
California  database. From these data we expect to identify around 2300 pediatric patients who 
ha
d a diagnostic procedure with an iodinated contrast agent.  
Data analysis: We will estimate incidence rates of hypothyroidism in the 365 days post exposed 
procedure. We
 will also describe these patients according to characteristics, comorbidities, 
treatments, and diagnostic procedure received , as well as the time-relation between contrast 
exposure and hypothyroidism 
Milestones:  A preliminary report will be provided by December 2016 and a final report by 31 
Mar
ch, 2017

 7. Rationale and background 
 
It is generally accepted that iodinated contrast agents can cause thyroid dysfunction because of 
the free iodide in the contrast solution. While a typical dose of 100 ml of contrast agent with an 
iodine concentration of 300 mg iodine/ml contains 30 g of bound iodine, the same solution also 
contains unbound or free iodine. Typical values of free iodide present in contrast material are 
 
. The
 actual amount of free iodide administered to a 
patient depends on the total dose, concentration and time between production of contrast agent 
and use.1,2 
 
Excessive free iodide may inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, causing hypothyroidism through an 
a
cute Wolff-Chaikoff effect. Normal thyroid hormone synthesis typically resumes after the acute 
Wolff-Chaikoff effect is corrected. Because neonates have immature thyroid tissue, they are 
especially susceptible to the Wolff-Chaikoff effect.1,2 Since it is known that thyroid hormones 
a
re essential for the development of newborn and infants, hypothyroidism may pose a serious 
threat to a child's physical and mental development if left untreated. Hypothyroidism can affect 
both newborns and older children and can lead to delayed growth, overweight, enlargement of 
the th
yroid gland, among other symptoms. In very young children prolonged hypothyroidism can 
lead to development delay. 3,4   
 
The
 incidence of hypothyroidism after exposure to iodinated contrast agents is unknown in this 
pa
tient population. In a literature review by Ahmet et al.1 nine studies were analyzed examining 
the e
ffects of iodinated i.v. contrast media on thyroid function of neonates. Overall 8.3% of the 
term infants and 18.3% of the premature infants developed hypothyroidism after iodinated 
contrast media exposure; suggesting that preterm infants have an increased risk of hypothyroid 
c
ompared to term infants. The authors noted that all studies were highly affected by bias. A 
retrospective database-study in a mainly adult patient population reported that iodinated contrast 
media exposure was associated with incident hyperthyroidism (odds ratio [OR], 1.98; 95% CI, 
1.08-3.60), while no statistically significant association with incident hypothyroidism was 
obser
ved (OR, 1.58; 95% CI
, 0.95-2.62) (Rhee et al, Arch Int Med, 2012). In secondary analyse s 
CCI
8 
 an association with incident overt hypothyroidism was described. Due to its design, the study 
c
ould not report incidence estimates of hypothyroidism following contrast exposure.  
 
In general, hypothyroidism in children can have a wide variety of different etiologies including 
Hashimoto thyroiditis, some chromosomal disorders (Down Syndrome, Turner Syndrome), late-
onset congenital hypothyroidism, as well as central hypothyroidism caused by pathologies in the 
pituitary gland or hypothalamus (Counts D et al. , 2009). Acquired childhood hypothyroidism, a 
result of decreased thyroid production caused by a failure in the hypothalamus and pituitary, has 
mul
tiple causes including irradiation, drug exposures, iodine deficiency, neurosurgery, head 
trauma, tumors, or thyroid hormone resistance.3,4 Drugs such as thionamides, lithium, 
amiodarone, interferon, and anticonvulsants are known to suppress thyroid function or interfere 
with thyroid synthesis.  
 
We plan to estimate, in a large health maintenance organization (HMO) in Northern California, 
the rate of detected hypothyroidism in young children (age less than 4 years) exposed to an 
iodi
nated contrast agent.  
8. Research questions and objectives 
8.1 Primary objective 
The goal of this study is to estimate the incidence rate of hypothyroidism, detected in routine 
clinical practice, in a US-based general population of patients less than 4 years of age during 
years 2008 - 2015, in the 365 days post exposure to an iodinated contrast agent. . 
H
ypothy
roidism cases will be categorized into “probable iodine-induced hypothyroidism” and 
“possible alternative etiology” after medical records review.  
8.2 Secondary objective(s) 
The secondary objective(s) in this study is/are: 
 To de scribe children who have procedures with iodinated contrast agents 
 To de scribe the baseline characteristics of hypothyroidism cases and of the rest of the 
cohort as well as the time-relation between iodine contrast exposure and diagnosis of 
hypothyroidism,  using descriptive statistics. This will be done for all hypothyroidism 
cases and separate ly for the “probable iodine induced” category and the “possible 
alternative etiology” category. In the “probable iodine induced” category we will further 
9 
 ascertain the duration of the hypothyroidism episode. 
9. Research methods 
9.1 Study de sign 
This will be a retrospective cohort study to describe patient characteristics and incidence of 
hypothyroidism in a pediatric population of children up to 365 days after a diagnostic scan with 
iodi
nated contrast agent. The study will be based on secondary data collection only. 
 
9.2 Setting  
This study will be conducted using data from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California 
(KPNC) database, a large US-based HMO database.   
 
9.2.1 Study
 time frame 
We will identify all patients in the KPNC database who were under age 4 during the years 2008 
throug
h 2015. 
 
9.2.2 Selection criteria 
We will identif
y all patients who were in the KPNC database and who were under age 4  at some 
ti
me during the years 2008 through 2015. 
 
9.2.3 Study
 population 
 
The study population will be all patients who were under the age of 4 at some time during the 
years 2008 to 2015 in the US - based KPNC database who had a procedure with iodinated 
c
ontrast agent. A preliminary search of the data identified around 2300 people under age 4 who 
ha
d a procedure with iodinated contrast, by searching CPT and HCPCS codes. We will also 
re
quire that all children in the study were members of KPNC for at least 3 months before the 
iodi
nated contrast exposure, except where the child is under 3 months of age at time of initial 
e
xposure, and 2 weeks after the exposure. From this population we will exclude all children who 
ha
d a diagnosis of hypothyroid any time prior to the iodine contrast exposure. We will also 
exclude those with lab values for low thyroid (TSH > 5 mU/L for children) any time before the 
10 
 exposure, and those with thyroid replacement therapy, Hashimoto thyroiditis, or congenital 
h
ypothyroidism any time prior to the exposure. 
. 
9.3
 Variables  
 
9.3.1 Baseline characteristics 
 Demographics characteristics (age, sex, year of procedure) 
 C linical characteristics (comorbidities, type of radiological examination, bodyweight, 
he
ight, head-circumference, laboratory values (TSH, T3. T4 anti-thyroid antibodies, if 
a
vailable), and co - medications. 
 
9.3.2 Ex
posure 
Exposure will be identified through CPT codes for procedures that include iodinated contrast 
agent. The date the procedure was coded will be considered the date of exposure. The majority of 
these will be CT scans with contrast. We will also identify young children who had a left heart 
catheterization including cardio-angiography, ventriculography, and coronary angiography. Each 
c
hild will be followed for up to 365 days after a qualifying exposure (the exposure window). 
There will be no differentiation according to any specific brand of contrast agents, considering 
that there is general agreement that iodine induced hypothyroidism is considered a class-effect 
of all iodinated contrast agents and not restricted to specific agents 
9.3.3 Outcome measures 
 
Potential cases of hypothyroidism will be defined by: 
 A c oded diagnosis of hypothyroidism and/or 
 A thyroid function tests indicating hypothyroidism and/or 
 Ne w use of thyroid replacement therapy  
 
Cases of hypothyroid will be identified using ICD 9 DM codes, lab values and NDC codes. See 
appendix for code lists.  From the exposed population we will identify all children who have a 
diagnosis of hypothyroidism in the 365 days after iodine contrast exposure. We will also 
identify those with lab values for low thyroid (TSH > 5.0 mU/L) or receipt of thyroid 
11 
 replacement therapy in the 365 days post exposure. All children who meet any of these criteria 
will be considered potential cases of hypothyroidism. We will review the electronic record of 
each child considered to be a potential case to confirm that they did not have hypothyroidism 
prior to exposure to the iodine contrast agent. We will also look for codes that support the 
presence of the hypothyroid condition. For example if a child receives more than one 
pr
escription for thyroid replacement, or has multiple labs with high TSH levels, or multiple 
c
odes for hypothyroidism these will be considered likely cases. We will then obtain original 
clinical notes to validate the diagnosis, by searching for evidence of pre-existing thyroid 
conditions. Specifically will look for a positive diagnosis of hypothyroid, lab results, repeated 
lab tests, notes of other medications associated with lowered thyroid (see appendix 3 for list of 
dr
ugs), and of Hashimoto thyroiditis, radiation, surgical procedures (see appendix 3 for list of 
pr
ocedures), and congenital forms of hypothyroid.    
Af
ter review of their electronic medical record, detected cases will be classified into: 
 P robable iodine-induced hypothyroidism: no other cause than the previous iodine contrast 
medium exposure could be identified 
 P ossible alternative etiology: Known other diseases (e.g. Hashimoto thyroiditis) or 
treatments (e.g. radiotherapy, drug treatments such as TK inhibitors, interferons, 
amiodarone and others) which may cause hypothyroidism   
 Not a  hypothyroidism case: No evidence of hypothyroidism in the patient’s medical 
record, e.g. coding error 
Esti
mated incidence rates will be calculated for all hypothyroidism cases together, and separate 
for
 “possible iodine induced hypothyroidism” and “possible alternative etiology.” 
 
 
9.4
 Data sources  
KPNC is an integrated health care delivery system providing health care to over 3.8 million 
membe
rs with 3,300 physicians, 32 outpatient clinics and 17 hospitals.  Analysis of U.S. census 
data demonstrates that KPNC members are representative of the population living in the served 
geographic area.5,6 KPNC maintains medical information on each patient through a computerized 
12 
 EHR database called “Health Connect” since 2007. Therefore, we have access to high quality 
c
linical data. 
 
Admitting, Discharge and Transfer (ADT) System. A complete database on all hospitalizations at 
any KPNC hospital since 1971 is maintained with data that are highly comparable to the UB-92 
forms (required of all hospitals in California and most other States), and contains a principal and 
up to 12 secondary discharge diagnoses and codes for up to seven procedures for each 
hospitalization. Admitting and discharge diagnoses and procedures are coded according to the 
International Classification of Disease, 9th revision (ICD-9).The accuracy of principal discharge 
diagnoses obtained from Kaiser Permanente databases has been verified in other studies.5,6  
 
The Laboratory Utilization and Reporting System (LURS) is a clinical database that captures all 
laboratory tests and results performed at the Kaiser Permanente of Northern California regional 
laboratory since 1991. In 1995, LURS incorporated all hospital-based laboratories of Northern 
C
alifornia. Providers use this system to order tests, obtain results and share them with patients. 
Thus, data in LURS are of higher quality than a chart review study could achieve (since chart 
review involves small rates of reviewer and transcription error). LURS contains patient name, 
medic
al record number, test name (each test has a unique code), date, and result. Essentially all 
th
yroid tests ordered are available in the LURS database.  
 
Outpatient Service Clinical Record (OSCR),  a computerized database, will be a source to 
identify outpatient diagnosis of thyroid disorders.  
 
The database contains a unique identifier for all information on all drugs issued to patients, all 
hospitalizations, captured with ICD-9 coding, outpatient diagnoses and   laboratory tests and 
re
sult.  KPNC membership is stable and more than 97% of members have 5 or more years of 
membership. 
9.5 Study Size 
Ar
ound 2300 children exposed to iodinated contrast agent among all pediatric patients. 
 
13 
 9.6 Data management 
Data management will be conducted at KPNC where a data set of all children under age 4 will be 
c
reated. From this database children exposed to iodinated contrast will be identified and followed 
for a year to detect hypothyroidism. Researchers at KPNC in collaboration with BU researchers 
will
 review electronic records to ensure data validity. All primary data will be held at KPNC.  
Further details can be found in the DMP. 
 
9.7 Data analysis  
Incidence density rates will be calculated using person-time of follow up.  Baseline 
characteristics of the cases with hypothyroidism and of the rest of the cohort as well as the time-
relation between iodine contrast exposure and diagnosis of hypothyroidism will be described 
using descriptive statistics. This will be done for all hypothyroidism cases and separate ly for the 
“probable iodine induced” category and the “possible alternative etiology” category. In the 
“probable iodine induced” category we will further ascertain the duration of the hypothyroidism 
episode. 
If sample size and number of hypothyroidism cases allows, joint associations between possible 
risk factors and hypothyroidism will be examined in a multivariate statistical model (e.g. age, 
sex, bodyweight, type of procedure) 
 
9.8 Quality control  
At the BC
DSP/BU epidemiologists will work closely with our KPNC collaborators to ensure 
correct clinical definitions and data integrity. All analyses will be performed by trained 
e
pidemiologists familiar with large electronic health databases. We have procedures for checking 
data to be sure that the data have been correctly identified and classified.  That is, we will check 
the characteristics of the study population to be sure they meet the study criteria by reviewing a 
random sample of electronic case records (“profiles”). We will create cross tabulations to 
de
scribe the characteristics (including age, sex, comorbidities) of the study population and 
compare the results to the limited available epidemiology literature of hypothyroidism in young 
c
hildren and exposure to iodine  in US youth. We will do data checks to confirm that person time 
was correctly calculated, and we will review the full electronic patient record to validate cases of 
CCI
14 
 hypothyroidism  and we will also abstract information from the patients complete medical records 
to validate
 all cases. 
 
9.9 Limitations of the research methods 
There is access to original clinical records in the KPNC  database, thus validation will be 
possi
ble. However we may miss some children who had procedure using iodinated contrast if the 
pr
ocedures were not coded  properly. It is also possible that some children will have undiagnosed 
hypothyroidism. These will also be missed in this study.  
 
Although most members enroll through their employers, many are members of KPNC through 
MediCal (a low-income health insurance plan). Analysis of U.S. census data demonstrates that 
KPNC members are representative of the general population with regard to ethnicity and 
education and differ only slightly with regard to income, we tend to underrepresent the very rich 
and the very poor. Members are remarkably similar to the general population in terms of 
employment status, marital status, screening practices, and prevalence of medical conditions, 
when compared with population-based data from the California Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance System.   
9.10 Other aspects  
None noted 
 
10. Protection of human subjects 
Data will be derived from a large de-identified database (KPNC) and the study will go through 
the 
 review process to ensure protection of all patients involved. 
 
11. Management and reporting of adverse events/adverse reactions 
As per the EMA Guideline on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices (Module VI–Management 
and reporting of adve
rse reactions to medicinal products), for non-interventional study designs 
that are based on secondary use of data, individual reporting of adverse reactions is not 
required. Reports of adverse events/reactions will be summarized in the study report (European 
PPD
15 
 Medicines Agency 2012).  
 
12. Plans for disseminating and communicating study results 
Results will be provided to Bayer Pharma AG in a preliminary repor t no later than March 2017. 
S
tudy results will be published following guidelines of the International Committee of Medical 
Journal Editors (ICMJE, 2013), and communication in appropriate scientific venues will be 
c
onsidered. 
When reporting results of this study, the appropriate STROBE checklist (STROBE, 2007) will 
be followed.

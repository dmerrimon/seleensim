Section  Revision 
Table 8  Added treatment of asymptomatic bacteremia is prescribed 
based on the opinion of the investigator2 
 2 According to guidelines in both Europe and the United 
States, treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (the presence of 
1 or more species of bacteria growing in the urine irrespective of the presence of pyuria, in the absence of signs or symptoms 
attributabl e to UTI) is in most cases not beneficial and may be 
harmful. Based on standard of care and protocol restrictions 
surrounding use of additional antibiotics, patients in this trial 
should not receive additional antibiotic for asymptomatic 
bacteriuria.  Addi tional therapy should only be given if signs 
and symptoms warrant ongoing treatment for symptomatic cUTI (i.e., based on their clinical course in the absence of 
microbiological data).

Title:  A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-blind, Active -controlled 
Noninferiority Study Evaluating the Efficacy, Safety, and 
Tolerability of Cefepime/VNRX -5133 in Adults with Complicated 
Urinary Tract Infections , Including Acute Pyelonephritis  
Phase of Study:  Phase 3  
Target Population: Adult male and female patients with complicated urinary tract 
infection (cUTI) , including acute pyelonephritis  (AP)  
Number of Patients:  582 patients will be randomized into 2 groups in a 2:1 ratio 
(388 patients to cefepime/VNRX -5133; 194 patients to 
meropenem)  
Number of Sites:  Approximately 122 sites in the United States and other countries  
Study Duration:  Approximately 14 months  
Duration of Treatment:  7 days (up to 14 days for patients with bacteremia)  
Drug Administered:  Test:  Cefepime/VNRX -5133 (2 g/0.5 g intravenously [IV] every 
8 hours [q8h]) 
Active comparator:  Meropenem  (1 g IV q8h)  
Study Drug Administration:  All study drugs will be provided by the sponsor.  
For c efepim e/VNRX-5133, cefepime hydrochloride (2 g/vial, 
sterile, white to pale yellow powder) and VNRX-5133 (0.5 g/vial 
sterile, white to yellow powder ) will each be reconstituted 
independently, then combined into a single IV bag, and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride solution for IV injection. Cefepime/VNRX-5133 will be administered q8h via IV pump over a 2-hour period. In order to maintain the blind, patients 
randomized to c efepime/VNRX -5133 will also receive meropenem 
placebo  (0.9% sodium chloride solution) administered via IV 
pump over 30 minutes. 
Meropenem (1 g/vial) will be reconstituted in a single IV bag and 
will serve as active comparator for IV injection. Meropenem will be administered q8h via IV pump over 30 minutes. In order to maintain the blind, patients randomized to meropenem will also receive cefepime/VNRX -5133 placebo (0.9% sodium chloride 
solution) administered via IV pump over a 2-hour period. 
Study drug and placebo IV bags as well as IV tubing will be 
blinded with sleeves.  
All patients will be treated for 7 days of IV therapy. Patients with bacteremia may receive up to 14 days of treatment at  the 
inves tigator ’s discretion.

staff will remain blinded to study drug. 
Objectives:  Primary objective:  
• To assess the efficacy  of cefepime/VNRX -5133 compared 
with meropenem with respect to both per- patient 
microbiologic eradication and symptomatic resolution of all urinary tract infection (UTI )-core symptoms ( or return 
to pre-morbid baseline ) at the T est of C ure (TOC) visit  
Secondary objectives:  
• To determine the efficacy of cefepime/VNRX -5133 
compared with meropenem with respect to the per- patient 
microbiological response, per -pathogen microbiologic 
response, and symptomatic resolution of all UTI- core 
symptoms at various timepoints in various populations 
• To determine the efficacy of cefepime/VNRX -5133 
compared with meropenem with respect to the per- patient 
microbiological response, pe r-pathogen microbiologic 
response, and symptomatic resolution of all UTI- core 
symptoms in patients with cUTI due to cefepime- resistant 
pathogens at various timepoints in various populations  
• To evaluate the safety and to lerability profile of 
cefepime/VNRX -5133 compared with meropenem in the 
treatment of patients with a cUTI in the safety population  
• To evaluate the steady -state pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
cefepime and VNRX -5133 in patients using a population 
PK model  
Study Design:  Study VNRX-5133-201 is a Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double- blind , double-dummy, active- controlled noninferiority 
study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cefepime/VNRX -5133 compared with an a ctive control, 
meropenem , in adult patients with cUTI, including AP . Each 
patient is expected to complete the study within approximately 4 to 5 weeks.  
After obtaining  signed informed consent and confirming eligibility 
within 24 hours prior to randomization, pa tients will be 
randomized  in a 2 :1 ratio to receive either cefepime/VNRX -5133 
Protocol VNRX -5133 -201 Amendment 2  VNRX -5133

Confidential  Page 14 of 101   (2 g/0.5  g IV q8h) or the active comparator, meropenem  (1 g IV 
q8h) on Study D ay 1.  
Patients will be stratified by the type of infection (AP only versus 
complicated lower UTI with or without AP ) and by region (North 
America and Western Europe versus Eastern Europe versus rest of the world). At least 30% of the population will have AP .  
Patients may recei ve up to 24 hours of antibacterials for treatment 
of cUTI prior to randomization ; however, the number of patients 
with prior antibacterial use will be limited to approximately 25% 
of the population. Before receipt of study drug, a urine specimen 
and blood cultures will be obtained from all patients for culture and for in vitro  antibacterial  susceptibility testing. Patients with an 
indwelling catheter should have urine samples collected following the placement of a new catheter, or if the indwelling catheter cannot be removed, aseptic techniques should be used through a properly disinfected collection port. Patients with an indwelling 
catheter should be randomized only if they are expected to permanently discontinue use of the catheter prior to Study Day 5. 
Screening assessments will also include a Daily  Patient Symptom 
Questionnaire (D PSQ) and a Pre-morbid P atient Symptom 
Questionnaire (PPSQ) . The D PSQ will be administered at 
screening , daily while on study drug, and at End of T reatment 
(EOT ), TOC , and Late F ollow-up ( LFU ) visits to determine the 
presence and intensity of cUTI symptoms.  The PPSQ  will be 
administered once at screening  to determine whether a patient 
normally experiences urinary tract symptoms ( i.e., in the absence 
of a UTI) that may be attributable to other disease processes 
(e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia [BPH] ).  
Study drug will be administered  IV for 7 days and will be 
considered completed after the third dose on Study Day 7 for patients without bacteremia . All patients (who do not require 
dosing adjustments for renal dysfunction) will receive at least 19 doses . Patients witho ut bacteremia will receive a maximum of 
21 doses of active study drug. Patients with bacteremia at study 
entry may have their treatment extended up to 14  days at the 
investigator’s discretion.  
Patients will be admitted at screening and remain at the study site or hospital for the duration of the IV treatment period and through the EOT visit.  The EOT visit will be performed within  24 hours 
after the last dose of IV study drug. Patients may be discharged 
from the study site after the EOT visi t if clinically stable and at the 
investigator ’s discretion.

1 Perform screening as sessment prior to first dose of IV study drug. Assessments performed as part of routine standard of care prior to consent (e.g., blood 
culture, laboratory tests) may be used to satisfy screening requirements; however, no study -specific procedures may be performed prior to informed consent.  
2 Administration of the first dose of IV study drug marks the beginning of Study Day 1. Subsequent study days are based on cale ndar days.  
3 The duration of treatment with study drug will be 7 days. Patients with bacteremia a t study entry may have their treatment extended up to 14 days at the 
investigator’s discretion.  
4 EOT visit will be performed  within 24 hours after the last dose of IV therapy. When EOT occurs on the same calendar day as the last day of IV therapy, any 
assessments already performed on that calendar day do not need to be repeated, unless EOT occurs on Study Day 1 or clinically in dicated based on the 
investigator’s judgement.  
5 TOC visit will occur between  Study Day s 19 and 23 . 
6 LFU visit will occur  between Study Days 2 8 and 35 .  
7 Randomization will occur after screening and prior to first dose  of study drug . It may be on the same cale ndar day as Study Day 1 or on the previous calendar 
day. 
8 A UTI -focused physical examination includes assessment of costovertebral angle tenderness and suprapubic/pelvic tenderness.

Confidential  Page 26 of 101   9 UTI- focused physical examination , DPSQ, and vital signs do not need to be repeated on Study Day 1 if screening  and Study Day 1 occur on the same calendar 
day.  
10 Record vital signs ( heart rate,  respiratory rate, temperature [oral or tympanic], and blood pressure). If more than 1 set of vital sign s is acquired on a given 
calendar day, the highest temperature and the heart rate,  respiratory rate, and blood pressure associated with that temperature (or those acquired nearest to that 
temperature) will be recorded.  
11 Calculate eGFR using the MDRD formula at screening . If the investigator  (or designee) determines that calculation of eGFR  during the treatment period  is 
warranted postbaseline (e.g., due to change in clinical status or for evaluation of need for dose change), local laboratory s erum creatinine should be used and 
the results should be reported as an unscheduled laboratory test. See Section  7.8.2 for details for the calculation of eGFR.  
12 ECGs  will be performed at screening and on Study Day 4 immediately after completion of cefepime/VNRX -5133 or cefepime /VNRX -5133  placebo infusion . 
13 To demonstrate pyuria during screening, microscopy evaluation of urine for the identification of at least 10 WBCs per cubic millimeter OR microscopic 
evaluation of at least 10 WBCs per high -power field in urine sediment may be performed OR a urinary dipstick for the presence of leukocyte esterase may be 
performed during screening.  
14 Serum β -hCG must be performed as part  of screening/eligibility  in women of child bearing potential . A patient may begin study drug  on the basis of a negative 
urine β -hCG  performed at a local laboratory , but a serum β -hCG test must still be sent to the central laboratory  for confirmation.  
15 Blood and urine specimens at screening  will be sent to a local laboratory to confirm eligibility for randomization. Specimens will be also sent to the central 
laboratory at the timepoints noted in the table.  
16 Sparse PK sampling timepoints are detailed in  Section  7.10.

1.1 Background 
The β -lactam class of antibiotics, because of their efficacy and safety profile, are the most widely 
used class of antibacterial drugs in both the community and hospital settings. However, the 
utility of all members of this class of drugs is being threatened by the spread of ne w β-lactamases 
in gram -negative pathogens with a very broad spectrum of hydrolyzing activity. While different 
β-lactam class drugs (i.e.,  penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams, and carbapenems) are 
differentially affected by various enzymes, no members of the class are unscathed.1 
VNRX-5133 is a non- β-lactam β- lactamase inhibitor with potent and selective direct inhibitory 
activity against both serine - and metallo -β-lactamases (i.e., Ambler Classes A, B, C, and D). 
VNR X-5133, in combination with cefepime, has the potential to address the serious unmet 
medical need for a safe and effective therapy for treatment of infections caused by multidrug resistant (MDR) gram -negative bacteria, particularly extended -spectrum β- lactamase-producing 
organisms and carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
Cefepime is a broad -spectrum, fourth- generation cephalosporin antibiotic administered 
intravenously (IV) that has been in clinical use for over 2 decade s for the treatment of serious 
infections, including moderate to severe pneumonia, complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI s), and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs).  
VenatoRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VenatoRx) is developing VNRX-5133 for use in combination with cefepime for the treatment of cUTI , a disease that has been associated with an alarming 
increase in the incidence of MDR β -lactamase-producing organisms. 
cUTI is defined as a clinical syndrome characterized by pyuria and a documented mi crobial 
pathogen on a culture of urine or blood accompanied by local and systemic signs and symptoms, including fever, chills, malaise, flank pain, back pain, and/or costovertebral angle pain or tenderness, that occur in the presence of a functional or anatomical abnormality of the urinary tract or in the presence of catheterization. Patients with acute pyelonephritis (AP), regardless of underlying abnormalities of the urinary tract, are considered a subset of patients with cUTIs.  
VNRX-5133 in combination with cefepime has demonstrated potent in vitro  activity against 
CRE and P aeruginosa based on 90% minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) determinations. 
Several in vitro  studies have also shown that the antibacterial activity of cefepime/VNRX -5133 
is largely unaffected by the presence of urine, with most MICs determined in the presence of 
urine within one doubling dilution of MICs determined in its absence (LSI study VNRX-001-16; IHMA study  2931). A comprehensive nonclinical safety assessment program was conducted to 
support further clinical studies with VNRX-5133. The initial safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) study of cefepime/VNRX-5133 when administered IV to human subjects has been previously evaluated in Phase 1 studies. Cefepime/VNRX-5133 was well tolerated in these studies.

Confidential  Page 35 of 101   A detailed summary of the available nonclinical and clinical data for cefepime/V NRX -5133 is 
provided in the  Investigator’s Brochure  (IB).1 
1.2 Study Rationale  
Cefepime/VNRX-5133 is being developed as an IV antibiotic formulation in combination for the 
treatment of patients with serious g ram-negative bacterial infections. The strategy of using 
β-lactam/ β-lactamase inhibitor combinations for treatment of infections caused by 
β-lactamases-producing pathogens has been successful in a variety of bacterial infections. 
Gram -negative pathogens, including those producing extended- spectrum β- lactamases ( ESBLs ), 
AmpC β -lactamases, and carbapenemases, are important causes of cUTIs. The spectrum of 
activity of cefepime/VNRX -5133 is well suited for the treatment of pathogens commonly 
responsible for cUTIs.  
Meropenem has been selected as the comparator because it has demonstrated efficacy against gram -negative pathogens isolated in cUTIs, including pyelonephritis. Although meropenem is 
approved for other indications, including cIAI, skin and soft tissue structure infections, and 
bacterial meningitis in pediatric patients , it is not approved f or use in cUTI in the United States 
(US). However, meropenem is approved for cUTI in other geographic regions. Furthermore, 
carbapenems are the drug s of choice against ESBL -producing gram -negative pathogens, 
especially in serious infections. As such, it is an appropriate comparator to use when evaluating a new drug designed to treat infections due to bacteria harboring serine β-lactamases.  
1.2.1 Dose Select ion Rationale 
For the cefepime/VNRX -5133 treatment group, the selected dose and infusion duration of 
cefepime/VNRX -5133 selected are expected to provide drug exposure that will result in a high 
probability of the PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) target attainment . A number of in vitro  and in vivo  
PK/PD studies have been conducted to characterize the pharmacological basis of VNRX -5133 
efficacy when combined with cefepime. The goals of these studies have been to 1) identify the PK/PD index that best describes the exposure-response relationship of VNRX- 5133 administer ed 
in combination with cefepime and 2) characterize the magnitude of the PK/PD index required for various degrees of bacterial killing.  In ad dition, the results from the nonclinical PK/PD studies 
conducted to date, the human PK data collected in Phase 1 studies, and human plasma protein binding data were used to select  human therapeutic doses. Lastly, the probability of PK/PD target 
attainment in clinical efficacy studies was further explored by the construction of a population PK model based on Phase 1 data and use of Monte Carlo simulations. Taken together, these data 
demonstrate that a 0.5 g dose of VNRX-5133, when administered with cefepime 2 g every 8 hours (q8h), is expected to be highly effective, even after taking into account increased PK variability  expected  in a patient population compared to that observed in healthy volunteers in 
Phase 1 studies. 
Cefepime/VNRX-5133 will be administered as an IV infusion over 2 hours. Meropenem 1  g q8h will be given as an active comparator. In the US and elsewhere, meropenem 
is approved at doses of 0.5 or 1 g q8h, depending on the type of infection. The Summary of 
Product Characteristics indicates that doses of 0.5 or 1 g meropenem q8h is appropriate for cUTI.

Cefepime/VNRX -5133 for the Treatment of cUTI  VenatoRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
   
Confidential  Page 36 of 101   In order to ensure the best therapy against pathogens that are more difficult to treat, the dose of 
1 g has been chosen. Although meropenem is not approved in the US for cUTI, the US prescribing information  indicates that 1  g meropenem q8h is appropriate for the treatment of 
patients with cIAI s and skin and soft tissue structure infections due to P aeruginosa, which is 
consistent with the goal to use a higher dose (i.e., 1 g) in more difficult- to-treat infections.  
Patient s with bacteremia at study entry may have their treatment extended up to 14 days at the 
investigator’s discretion.  
Additional details on human PK and clinical dosing regimen are provided in the IB.

1.2.2 Patient Selection Rationale  
The population enrolled into the study will include adult male and female patients with cUTI (AP or complicated lower urinary tract infection  [UTI]). At least 30% of patients will be 
diagnosed with AP. Before receipt of study drug, urine specimen and blood cultures will be 
obtained from all patients for culture and for in vitro  antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Patie nts 
known to have a pathogen with documented resistance to meropenem should be excluded from the study. 
1.3 Benefit -Risk Assessment  
The population for this study will comprise patients with cUTI that are of sufficient severity to 
require hospitalization and  treatment with IV antibiotics. The potential benefit to participating 
patients is in receiving effective antibiotic treatment for their infections. The potential benefit of the study, in general, is the identification of a novel antibiotic combination product that is an effective treatment for cUTI in the face of the changing pattern of antibiotic resistance and the need for antibiotics to treat increasingly resistant bacteria. It is possible that cefepime/VNRX -5133 will not prove to be a sufficiently effe ctive treatment for cUTIs (i .e., not 
as effective as the comparator treatment). This risk is mitigated in that the patients will be  closely 
monitored and managed with appropriate therapies as determined by the investigator who is providing treatment. 
The r isk considerations for this study should encompass the known and potential risks for the 
development product cefepime/VNRX-5133 and its component products cefepime and 
VNRX-5133, as well as the marketed product meropenem. The risks for cefepime and 
meropenem are  widely available in their respective prescribing information ; such risks will not 
be discussed in  this section.  
The risks for cefepime/VNRX -5133 have not been fully elucidated; however, it is assumed that 
known or potential risks for cefepime/VNRX-5133 should include those identified in the clinical study experience with cefepime/VNRX-5133, VNRX-5133 alone, and cefepime alone. Potential risks for cefepime/VNRX -5133 include the occurrence of events seen with cefepime alone but 
may occur at a greater  frequency and/or severity than  those seen with cefepime. In Phase 1 
studies, constipation and abdominal pain were reported. Additional risk information for 
VNRX-5133 and cefepime/VNRX-5133 are located in the VNRX-5133 IB .

for cefepime is described in the prescribing information for the product.

Confidential  Page 37 of 101   In nonclinical studies of VNRX-5133 alone, the kidney was determined to be a target organ of 
VNRX-5133 toxicity in both rats and dogs. In nonclinical studies of VNRX-5133 in combination with cefepime, there was no evidence of new or increased severity of toxicity in the combination- treated animals relat ive to animals treated with either drug alone based on clinical 
pathology, gross pathology, or histological parameters. No evidence of renal toxicity has been observed in Phase 1 studies of VNRX-5133 when administered alone or in combination of cefepime/VN RX-5133. Further information on nonclinical safety assessment and clinical safety 
is summarized in the IB.

3.1 Study Design 
Study VNRX-5133-201 is a Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, 
active-controlled noninferiority study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cefepime/VNRX -5133 compared with an active control, meropenem , in adult patients with cUTI, 
including AP. Each patient is expected to complete the study within approximately 4 to 5 weeks.   
Patients with cUTI, including AP, will be enrolled. After obtaining signed informed consent and confirming eligibility within 24 hours prior to randomization, patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either cefepime/VNRX -5133 (2 g/0.5 g IV q8h) infused over 2 hours plus 
meropenem placebo infused over 30 minutes  or the active comparator, meropenem (1 g IV q8h) 
infused over 30 minutes plus cefepime/VNRX-5133 placebo infused over 2 hours starting on Study Day 1.  
Patients will be stratified by the type of infection (AP  only versus complicated lower UTI with or 
without AP) and by region (North America and Western Europe versus Eastern Europe versus 
rest of the world). At least 30% of the p opulation will have AP .  
Patients may receive up to 24 hours of antibacterials for treatment of cUTI prior to randomization; however, the number of patients with prior antibacterial use will be limited to 
approximately 25% of the population. Before receipt of study drug, urine specimen and blood 
cultures will be obtained from all patients for culture and for in vitro  antibacterial susceptibility 
testing. Patients with an indwelling catheter should have urine samples collected following the placement of a new catheter, or if the indwelling catheter cannot be removed, aseptic techniques should be used through a properly disinfected collection port. Patients with an indwelling catheter should be randomized only if they are expected to permanently discontinue use of the catheter prior to Study Day  5. 
Screening assessmen ts will also include a Daily Patient Symptom Questionnaire (D PSQ) and a 
Pre-morbid Patient Symptom Questionnaire (PPSQ). The D PSQ will be administered at 
screening , daily while on study drug, and at End of Treatment ( EOT ), TOC, and Late Follow -up 
(LFU ) visits to determine the presence and intensity of cUTI symptoms. The PPSQ will be 
administered once at screening to determine whether a patient normally experiences urinary tract symptoms ( i.e., in the absence of a UTI) that may be attributable to other disease processes 
(e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia [BPH]).  
Study drug will be administered IV for 7 days and will be considered completed after the third 
dose on Study Day 7 for patients witho ut bacteremia. All patients (who do not require dosing 
adjustments for renal dysfunction) will receive at least 19 doses . Patients without bacteremia will 
receive a maximum of  21 doses of active study drug . Patients with bacteremia at study entry may 
have their treatment extended up to 14  days at the investigator ’s discretion.  
Patients will be admitted at screening and remain at the study site or hospital for the duration of 
the IV treatment period and through the EOT visit . The EO T visit will be performed within 
24 hours after the last dose of IV study drug. Patients may be discharged from the study site after the EOT visit  if clinically stable and at the investigator ’s discretion.

5.3 Dose and Administration 
Each patient will receive a 30 -minute infusion and  a 2-hour infusion q8h. If only 1 lin e is 
available for IV medication administration, the 30-minute infusion should be administered prior to the 2-hour infusion. The 30-minute and 2-hour infusions may be administered co ncurrently if 
2 separate lines are used.  
Patients randomized to cefepime/VNRX -5133 will receive meropenem placebo IV immediately 
followed by cefepime/VNRX-5133 (2 g/0.5 g IV q8h). Meropenem placebo will be administered via IV pump over 30 minutes. Cefepime/VNRX -5133 will be administered via IV pump over a 
2-hour period.  
Patients randomized to receive meropenem  will also receive cefepime/VNRX -5133 placebo  IV 
immediately follow ing meropenem (1 g IV q8h). Meropenem will be infused over 30 minutes. 
Cefepime/VNRX- 5133 placebo will be administered via IV pump over a 2-hour period.

2, a 1-time adjustment of dose regimen for cefepime/VNRX-5133 or 
meropenem may be made after administration of the first dose to allow the patient to shift onto a 
hospital medication administration schedule. The ir second dose may be administered as soon as 
4 hours and as long as 10 hours after administration of the first dose. No other adjustments to  
cefepime/VNRX -5133 or meropenem may be made, except for patients with changes in eGFR as 
described in Section  5.3.2.  
The date and time of each infusion (start and stop time of infusion) will be recorded. In the event that there is an issue with a patient’s IV infusion site, the planned infusion may be paused to restart another IV. The stop and re start times must be recor ded. 
Dosing adjustments for cefepime/VNRX -5133 (or cefepime/VNRX-5133 placebo) and 
meropenem (or meropenem placebo) in patients with renal insufficiency are described in Section  5.3.2. The initial dose chosen should be based on the most recent eGFR value  obtained 
prior to dosing. However,  because dosing recommendations for the study drugs vary depending 
on the patient’s renal function, the investigator should consider whether the  change in eGFR 
warrants a change in IV study drug dosage or frequency. Since a decline in renal function may be

different dosing recommendations for cefepime/VNRX-5133 [or cefepime/VNRX-5133 pl acebo] 
and meropenem [or meropenem placebo]) or when eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (at 
which point study drug should be discontinued), a repeat serum creatinine test result should be 
obtained, and eGFR calculation should be repeated  before dose adjust ments are made.

Note: eGFR is calculated using the MDRD formula.  
5.3.2 Dose Adjustment for Patients with eGFR ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 
When clinically indicated, eGFR calculation should be repeated to determine whether dose adjustment is needed. If the dose is adjusted, local clinical laboratory and eGFR results should be 
recorded on the unscheduled/local laboratory electronic case report form (eCRF ). 
The dose regimen of all study drugs should be adjusted according to the guidelines detailed in Table  3 based on eGFR. Given the different eGFR requirements for dose change across the 
treatment regime nts, eGFR should be re-t ested before adjusting therapy if the e GFR is between 
50 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m
2. Similarly , eGFR should be re-tested before discontinuing therapy 
when the eGFR is <30 mL/min/1.73 m2.  
The adjusted dose regimens for pat ients based  eGFR are also presented in  Figure 3 and Figure 4.

5.4 Treatment Duration  
All patients will receive 7 days of IV treatment.  Based on the scheduled study drug 
administration for patients without bacteremia, the patient could complete treatment on study day 
7 or study day 8.  
All non- bacteremic patients (who do not require dosing adjustments for renal dysfunction) will 
receive at least 19 doses and no more than 21 doses of study drug.

Confidential  Page 52 of 101   Patients with bacteremia at study entry may have their treatment extended up to  14 days at the 
investigator’s discretion , but ma y complete therapy as early  as Study Day 7 after their third dose .  
There is no oral stepdown therapy, and patients are not permitted to continue oral antibacterials 
at home after completion of IV study drug (e.g. prophylaxis). If prophylactic therapy is warranted  due to recurrent cUTIs, it should not be started until after the LFU  visit if possible.  
Patients who are known to require prophylactic therapy and for whom withholding therapy until the LFU visit is not in their best interest should not be e nrolled (see Exclusion Criterion  8).  The 
Investigator should continually assess whether the study drug has failed (i.e., the patient has signs and symptoms of cUTI that have not improved or have recurred such that additional antibiotic therapy is warranted) and rescue therapy is required.  
5.5 Accountability  
Study drug will only be prepared by the unblinded pharmacist or designee. Study drug will be dispensed in a blinded manner to the investigator or medically qualified  designated personnel by 
the unblinded pharmacist  or designee. Study drug will only be administered to patients by 
medically qualified designated personnel who have been appropriately trained to administer study drug. 
The unblinded pharmacist is responsible for the control of study drugs under investigation. 
Adequate records of the receipt and disposition of the study drug must be maintained. Drug disposition records must be kept current. 
A separate unblinded study monitor will periodically review pharmacy logs and drug accountabilit y. All records and drug supplies must be available for inspection by the study 
monitor at every monitoring visit. Any reconstituted unused study drug has to be inactivated, and unused, used , or part ially used vials should be destroyed after use at the stud y site per local 
institute policy and procedures. If the study site  does not have a destruction policy, the unused, 
used, or partially used vials can be shipped back to the depot for destruction. Completed drug 
dispensation record s will be returned to the sponsor. The investigator’s copy of the drug 
dispensation record(s) must accurately document the return of all study drug supplies to the depot, if applicable . 
5.6 Treatment Compliance  
All study drug will be administered by medically qualified  designated perso nnel. To ensure 
treatment compliance, date, and exact start and stop times of study drug administration, including times for any interruptions that occur, will be recorded for all study drug administered in the 
eCRF by the investigator or authorized designee.

Confidential  Page 53 of 101   6 STUDY CONDUCT  
All procedures will be performed in accordance with the schedule of assessments as detailed in  
Table  1. Detailed instructions for specific study procedures are provided in Section 7. De tailed 
requirements for reporting AEs and SAEs are provided in Section 8. 
6.1 Enrollment and Randomization  
After providing informed consent, patient s will be enrolled into the study, entered into the 
Interactive Web Response System/Interactive Voice Response System  (IWRS/IVRS ), and 
assigned a unique screening number from the IWRS /IVRS  for the screening process. After 
completing the screening process, pa tients who meet all eligibility criteria will be re -entered into 
the IWRS /IVRS  and assigned a unique randomization number and study drug randomly 
computer-generated by the IWRS /IVRS . Randomization and screening numbers will not be 
reused. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive eit her cefepime/VNRX -5133 (2 g/0.5 g IV 
q8h) plus meropenem placebo, or the a ctive comparator,  meropenem (1 g IV q8h) plus 
cefepime/VNRX -5133 plac ebo, in a 2:1 ratio according to the randomization number. 
Randomization occurs after screening and prior to administration of the first dose of study drug. 
Administration of the first dose of study drug marks the start of Study Day 1. Therefore, randomization may occur on the same calendar day as Study Day 1 or on the previous calendar 
day.  
Patients will be stratified by the type of infection (AP only versus complicated lower UTI with or 
without AP) and by region (North America and Western Europe versus Eastern Europe versus rest of the world). At least 30% of the population will have AP . Patients may receive up to 
24 hours of antibacterial for treatment of cUTI prior to randomization ; however, the number of 
patients with prior antibacterial use will be limited to approximately 25% of the population.  
Patients w ho fail to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria should not be randomized or 
receive study drug. There will be no exceptions to this rule. Patients who fail to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will not be rescreened. Procedures for ineligible patients who are erroneously randomized are described in Section 6.1.1. 
6.1.1 Incorrectly Randomized Patients  
The investigator should inform the sponsor or designee of patients who are randomized erroneously, do not meet the selection criteria, are incorrectly started  on study drug, or who 
subsequently fail to meet the study criteria after treatment initiation. The patient should continue to receive study drug unless the investigator or sponsor considers that it is not in the best interest 
of the patient. The investiga tor should use their clinical discretion to determine whether 
discontinuation of study drug is warranted.  
6.1.2 Blinding  
All study drugs will be prepared at the study site by an unblinded pharmacist or designee. Prepared study drug and placebo IV bags and IV tubing will be blinded with sleeves to maintain the blind. To maintain blinding, the randomization code and study drug assignment will be 
provided by the IWRS /IVRS  to the unblinded pharmacist or unblinded designee for dispensing

Confidential  Page 54 of 101   purposes and kept in the pharmacy, accessible to the unblinded pharmacist and designee only. 
The unblinded pharmacist or designee is not permitted to perform any other study procedures. 
The sponsor, investigator, patient, and study site staff, with the exception of the unblinded 
pharmacist or designee, will remain blinded to study drug. The unblinded study monitor 
(separate from the other blinded monitors ) will also remain unblinded.  
The bioanalytical laboratory where the PK samples will be analyzed will b e provided treatment 
assignment information to facilitate analyzing samples using methods for only treatments 
administered . A third party pharmacokineticist responsible for the PK analysis may be unblinded 
in order to begin analysis of data prior to study completion. This pharmacokineticist will have no involvement in the conduct of the study. No one else will have access to the treatment assignment information. 
Procedures to maintain study blinding will be detailed in a separate blinding plan. 
6.1.3 Unblinding  
Unblinding of therapy assignment may be requested in an emergency if unblinding is considered 
necessary for medical management of the patient. In such case, the investigator is strongly encouraged to contact the medical monitor to discuss the case prior to unblinding; however, the decision and ability to unblind is independent of medical monitor ’s input. 
If the data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) determines individual treatment assignment unblinding for patients is required to support an ad hoc meeting, an independent statistician will provide treatment information to the DSMB, and the DSMB will review unblinded data in the closed session.  
6.2 Study Restrictions and Prohibitions   
6.2.1 Restricted and Prohibited Medications  
Use of systemic antibacterials other than study drug therapy, including prophylactic antibacterials , is not permitted during the study except in the following circumstances : 
• If Enterococcus spp. or methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus  is isolated  or 
suspected , then open-label vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin may be added to either 
of the study regimens according to the usual practice of the investigator.  
• When the investigator considers additio n of nonstudy antibacterials essential to the 
safety and well -being of the patient due to an AE (i.e., a new infection develops at 
another site). In this circumstance, if possible, the investigator should attempt to choose an antibacterial that will not have activity against the patient’s baseline cUTI pathogen(s) to avoid confounding the assessment of the effect of study drug.  
Patients who are known to require prophylactic therapy and for whom withholding therapy until LFU visit is not in their best interest should not be enrolled ( see Exclusion Criterion  8).

Cefepime/VNRX -5133 for the Treatment of  cUTI  VenatoRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
   
Confidential  Page 55 of 101   Probenecid should not be administered. Probenecid may decrease excretion of β -lactam 
antibiotics . 
Valproic acid and divalproex sodium should not be administered. Valproic acid concentrations in 
the blood may drop below the therapeutic range when co -administered with meropenem.  
The following medications should be used with caution in all patients:  
• Aminoglycosides: Concomi tant administration of cefepime results in an increased 
potential of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of am inoglycoside antibacterial drugs. 
Monitor renal function closely if aminoglycosides are administered  
• Diuretic  nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of other 
cephalosporins with potent diuretics such as furosemide. Monitor renal function when cefepime is concomitantly administered with potent diuretics.  
6.2.2 Contraception Requirements  
Male patients who are not surgically sterilized and female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective dual method of contraception during the study. A woman is considered of childbearing potential unless postmenopausal (age ≥ 50 years and ≥ 12 months without menses 
or age <50 years and ≥2 years without menses) or surgically sterilized. Male patients may not 
donate sperm from the first dose of study drug until 90 days after the last dose of study drug is administered.  
6.2.3 Management of Indwelling Bladder Catheters 
Indwelling bladder catheters that have been in place for >24 hours prior to screening  must be 
removed or replaced prior to collection of urine at screening for urinalysis and culture (unless removal or replacement is considered unsafe or is contraindicated due to a recent procedure or urological condition), so that the urine culture results are an accurate representation of th e 
pathogen(s) present.  
Patients should only be enrolled if the indwelling bladder catheter is expected to be permanently 
discontinued prior to Study Day 5.  
Indwelling bladder catheters should be maintained  as a sterile, closed drainage system, and the 
junction of the catheter and drainage tube should not be disconnected. Besides permanent 
catheter discontinuation, other indications for indwelling bladder catheter change may include malfunction or leakage, obstruction, and contamination of the system (breakage between the catheter and drainage tube).  
6.3 Premature Discontinuation  
Patients are free to withdraw from the study or study drug at any  time. Patients may also be 
prematurely discontinued from study drug or withdrawn from the study at the discretion of the 
investigator or sponsor at any time. Once a patient has been withdrawn from the study, they may

Confidential  Page 56 of 101   not be re-entered. Reasons for discontinuation from study drug or from the study will be 
collected in the eC RF. 
6.3.1 Study Drug  Discontinuation  
Patients may be prematurely discontinued from study drug (i.e., before 7 full days of therapy and/or before cure of the infection [i.e., rescue therapy is necessary] ) for the following reasons:  
• Insufficient therapeutic effect of the study drug (i.e., requirement for additional nonstudy 
antibacterial therapy to treat cUTI based on the investigator’s clinical judgement ) 
• AE 
• Withdrawal by patient (the patient is free to discontinue therapy at any time) 
• Physician decision (i.e., i n the opinion of the investigator , it is not in the best interest of 
the patient to continue study drug) 
• Sponsor decision 
• A decrease in eGFR to <30 mL/min/1.73 m
2 (An eGFR <30  mL/min/1.73 m2 should be 
rechecked and confirmed before discontinuation.) 
• AST or  ALT ≥10× ULN  
If a patient is prematurely discontinued from study drug, the EOT visit should be performed, and 
every effort should be made to retain the patient in the study and perform all assessments at the 
TOC and LFU visits. Patients withdrawn from study drug should receive rescue therapy (if appropriate) as determined by the investigator. 
6.3.2 Study Withdrawal  
Participation in the study is strictly voluntary. A patient has the right to withdraw from the study 
at any time for any reason  without prejudice to further treatment (withdrawal of consent). Such 
patients will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. If possible, the patient will be seen and assessed by the investigator at the time of withdrawal. If the patient has 
withdrawn from the study prior to completion of study therapy, every effort should be made to perform the EOT visit. AEs and SAEs will be followed up.  
6.4 Protocol Deviations 
A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures defined in the protocol. 
All deviations will be compiled in a centralized location.  
Deviations will be classified by whether or not they meet the definition of important protocol 
deviations in a blinded manner . Important protocol deviations are a subset of deviations that

Confidential  Page 57 of 101   might significantly affect the completeness, accuracy, and/or reliability of the study data or that 
might significantly affect a patient’s rights, safety, or well -being. 
Deviations will be categorized by type and will be reviewed on an ongoing basis. Protocol 
deviation notification and reports are submitted to regulatory authorities and/or relevant institutional review boards ( IRBs ) according to applicable requirements/guidelines/law. 
6.5 Data Collection  
All c linical data, including AEs and prior/concomitant medications, will be collected for each 
patient by an electronic data capture (EDC) system in an eCRF. Source data supporting EDC entries will be recorded in the patient’s medical records according to the standard practice of the study site.  
Investigators and study site personnel will be responsible for entering data within the eCRF and 
will respond to queries within the EDC system. Correction of any data errors and other such 
changes will be made within th e EDC system and captured in the electronic audit trail.

7.7 Efficacy E valuations  
7.7.1 Assessment of Symptomatic Clinical R esponse 
The symptomatic clinical success at TOC is one of the components of the primary outcome of this study; responses at EOT and LFU are secondary endpoints.  
During study conduct, patients will be required to report their cUTI symptoms on a series of 
formal questionnaires that will be administered by trained study center staff.  The PPSQ will be 
administered once at screening  to determine whether a patient normally experiences urinary tract 
symptoms (i .e., in the absence of a UTI) that may be attributable to other disease processes 
(e.g., BPH ). The patients will be administered the D PSQ at screening, daily while on study drug, 
and at EOT, TOC , and LFU visits . The data collected from the questionnaires will be used to 
programm atically assess the symptomatic clinical response as defined in Table  4 and Table  5. 
Instructions for performing the PPSQ and DPSQ are detailed in Appendix 2. 
The DPSQ should also be performed at any unscheduled visit occurring for any reason between 
the EOT and TOC visits and/or between the TOC and LFU visits .

A patient will be said to have symptomatic clinical relapse at the LFU visit if their symptomatic 
clinical response was success at the TOC visit and is failure at the LFU visit. Similarly, a patient will be said to have sustained symptomatic clinical success at the LFU vi sit if their symptomatic 
clinical response was success at the TOC visit and is success at the LFU visit.  
7.7.2 Assessment of Microbiological R esponse  
The microbiologic al response of per- patient eradication at the TOC visit in the micro ITT 
population is one of the components of the primary outcome. The per-pathogen microbiologic response in the m icroITT, ME population at the EOT, TOC, and LFU visits as well as the 
Protocol VNRX -5133 -201 Amendment 2  VNRX -5133

Confidential  Page 66 of 101   per-patient micro biological response in the microITT population at EOT and LFU and in ME 
population at EOT, TOC , and LFU are secondary outcomes. Microbiological response will be 
assessed per -pathogen and per -patient according to the definitions below. Microbiological 
outcome per- patient is assessed in a blinded manner.  It is based on outcome per-pathogen 
isolated at the initial visit (considered as causative ) and on the isolation of pathogens during the 
course of treatment or the posttreatment period. 
Each baseline pathogen will be categorized at EOT, TOC, and LFU visits according to the 
microbiological response  criteria shown in Table  6. 
Table  6 Microbiological Response Criteria  
Microbiological Response  Definition  
Eradication  Demonstration that the bacterial pathogen found at study entry 
(≥105 CFU/mL ) is eradicated  to <103 CFU/mL  
Persistence  Demonstration that the bacterial pathogen found at study entry 
(≥105 CFU/mL)  grows ≥103 CFU/mL  
Indeterminate microbiological response  Repeat cultures are not performed  
CFU=colony  forming unit.  
For patients from whom more than 1 baseline pathogen is isolated, the overall per -patient 
microbiological response assessment will be favorable only if the microbiologic response 
assessment for each of the baseline pathogens is eradication . 
A patient will be said  to have microbiologic recurrence at the LFU visit if their response was 
eradication at the TOC visit and persistence at the LFU visit. Similarly, a patient will  be said to 
have sustained eradication at the LFU visit if their response was eradication at the TOC visit and is eradication at the LFU visit.  
Pathogens identified in blood will be assigned a per -pathogen microbiologic response . In 
instances of cUTI with bacteremia, a favorable outcome for a baseline pathogen will require a favorable microbiologic response from the urine sample  as well as the blood . 
7.7.3 Other Microbiological Outcomes  
7.7.3.1 Emergent Infections  
Pathogens first appearing after baseline in patients with a different baseline pathogen are categorized as described in Table  7 and will be considered separately from microbiological 
response.

Emergent Infection  Definition  
Superinfection  Isolation of a new pathogen(s) (other than the original baseline pathogen[s]) from 
urine during treatment with study drug that is accompanied by new or worsening 
signs and symptoms of infection requiring alternative antimicrobial therapy  
New infection  Isolation of a new pathogen(s) (other than the original baseline pathogen[s]) from 
urine after completion of study drug that is accompanied by new or worsening 
signs and symptoms of infection requiring alternative antimicrobial therapy  
7.7.3.2 Persistence with Increasing M inimal  Inhibitory Concentration 
In patients with persistence, MICs of study drugs against pathogens isolated at baseline will be 
compared to MICs of study drugs against postbaseline pathogens. An outcome of persistence with increasing MIC is indicat ed by t he organism displaying a ≥4-fold higher MIC to study drug 
received in a urine or blood culture o btained at EOT or later compared to baseline.  
7.7.4 Specimen Collection and Analysis  
Detailed instructions for the collection, storage, and transport of specimens are provided in the laboratory manual.  
7.7.4.1 Urine Specimen  
An adequate urine specimen for microbiologic evaluation must be obtained and sent to the local laboratory for culture, identification, and in vitro  antibacterial susceptibility testing per 
institutional operating procedures at screening  prior to randomization and at EOT, TOC, and 
LFU  visits . 
Urine samples should not be obtained from urinary catheter bags. Acceptable methods of collection of urine for culture include the following:  
• Midstream clean catch (straight catheterization using sterile technique is  preferred for 
female patients)   
• Straight catheter ization using sterile technique 
• Suprapubic specimen col lection using sterile  technique  
• Whenever possible, urine specimens should not be obtained from indwelling bladder catheters. When necessary, urine specimens in patients with indwelling bladder catheters should be obtained by sterile aspiration through the catheter port or by puncturing the catheter tubing with a needle and syringe if a port is not present.  
The urine specimen should be plated for culture within 2 hours from the collection time, if the specimen is kept at r oom temperature. Alternatively, these tests may be performed within 
24 hours of collection if the specimen is stored at 2°C to 8°C before processing. Refer to the laboratory manual for specimen storage and handling instructions.

Confidential  Page 68 of 101   The specimens should be processed according to recognized methods3, 4 and following the 
standard operating procedures (SOPs) of the clinical microbiology laboratory at each study site .  
All isolates of uropathogens at ≥105 CFU/mL from the screening  cultures and isolates of 
gram -negative uropathogens at ≥103 CFU/mL from subsequent (i.e., follow- up) urine cultures 
must be sent by local laboratory to the central laboratory, where pathogen identification will be 
confirmed, and further susceptibility testing and char acterization will be performed. Urine 
samples from which more than 2 pathogens were isolated may be considered to represent contamination. 
All cultured isolates should be kept by the local laboratory until the end of the study as described 
in the laborator y manual.  
7.7.4.2 Blood C ultures  
Blood samples for microscopic evaluation, culture, identification , and in vitro  susceptibility 
testing will be collected at screening  for all patients  and processed at the local microbiology 
laboratory per institutional SOPs . Postbaseline, blood cultures will be performed as clinically 
indicated. For patients with positive baseline blood cultures, cultures will be repeated every 2 to 3 days until negative.  
Two sets of blood cultures should be collected from 2 different sites for aerobic incubation and, 
if possible, anaerobic incubation (i.e., 4 tubes). Each bottle should be inoculated with 10 to  
15 mL of blood for a total of 40 to 60 mL per collection. Ideally, a t least 1 set of blood cultures 
should be obtained through a venipuncture. Details concerning the collection  and processing  of 
blood cultures are provided in the laboratory manual. 
Isolated pathogens will be sent to the central microbiology laboratory where pathogen 
identification will be confirmed and further susceptibility testing and characterization will be performed. Bacteria not considered pathogens (i.e., contaminants) should not be sent to the central laboratory.  
Blood specimens should be processed according to recognized methods for aerobic and 
anaerobic organisms (e.g., as found in Jorgensen JH  and Pfaller MA , Manual of Clinical 
Microbiology
5; Leber AL , Clinical Microbiology Procedures Handbook6) following the SOPs  of 
the qualified clinical microbiology laboratory at each study site. Microscopic evaluation and culture of specimens will be perfo rmed by the qualified local laboratory, along with 
susceptibility testing of pathogens cultured from the specimens if such testing is consistent with standard procedures at the institution.  
All cultured isolates should be kept by the local laboratory until the end of the study as described 
in the laboratory manual. 
7.7.5 Investigator Opinion of Clinical Response

Failure  Patients who meet at least one of the following criteria:  
• Death related to cUTI  
• Persistence or progression of cUTI symptoms such that additional antibiotics for cUTI are required  
• Patient previously met criteria for failure (not applicable for the E OT 
visit)  
Indeterminate  An assessment was not performed due to any of the following:  
• Death where cUTI was clearly non -contributory  
• Assessment was not performed  (e.g. , due to missed visit, withdrawal of 
consent, or loss to follow -up) 
cUTI=complicated urinary tract infection; EOT=End of Treatment.  
1 This does not include antibacterials that are permitted  per protocol  for patients with Enterococcus  or 
methicillin -resistant S aureus  infections.  
2 According to guidelines in both Europe and the United States,  treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (the presence 
of 1 or more species of bacteria growing in the urine irrespective of the presence of pyuria, in the absence of signs or 
symptoms attributable to UTI) is in most cases not beneficial and may be harmful. Based on standard of care and 
protocol restrictions surrounding use of additional antibiotics, patients in this trial should not receive additional 
antibiotic for asymptomatic bacteriuria.  Additional therapy should only be given if signs and symptoms warr ant 
ongoing treatment for symptomatic cUTI (i.e., based on their clinical course in the absence of microbiological data).  
7.8 Safety Evaluations 
Safety and tolerability assessments will consist of AEs, clinical laboratory, vital signs, and 
12-lead ECG examina tions. Assessments will be performed in accordance with the schedule of 
assessments ( see Table  1). 
7.8.1 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be collected at screening , daily while on study drug therapy, at  EOT , TOC, and 
LFU  visits .  
Vital signs do not need to be repeated on Study Day 1 if screening  and Study Day 1 occur on the 
same calendar day .

Confidential  Page 70 of 101   At EOT , assessments already performed on the same calendar day do not need to be repeated 
unless cli nically indicated based on the investigator’s judgement. 
Vital signs include heart rate , respiratory rate, temperature (oral or tympanic), and blood 
pressure. If more than 1 set of vital signs is acquired on a given calendar day, record the highest 
temperature and the heart rate , respiratory rate, and blood pressure associated with that 
temp erature (or those acquired nearest to that temperature). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
and heart rate will be recorded after the patient has been resting for at least 5 minutes in the supine position. These assessments should made using an automated device.  
Vital signs should also be performed at any unscheduled visit occurring for any reason between the EOT and TOC visits and/or between the TOC and LFU visits .  
7.8.2 Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate  
The eGFR will be calculated at screening  to determine eligibility and appropriate dosing of study 
drug using local laboratory serum creatinine results using the MDRD formula .
2 If the 
investigator determ ines that calculation of eGFR is warranted postbaseline (e.g., due to change in 
clinical status and/or for evaluation of need for dose change), local laboratory serum creatinine 
should be used and the results reported as an unscheduled laboratory test. An eGFR will also be 
calculated by the central lab oratory  using central blood results.  
Calculation of eGFR is detailed below: 
eGFR=175 × (S cr)-1.154 × (age)-0.203 × 0.742 [if female] × 1.212 [if black] 
Note:  The e thinicity factor should only be used for African Americans and should not be used 
with black patients of all other nationalities.  
where S cr is serum creatinine in mg/dL and eGFR is measured in mL/min/1.73m2. 
7.8.3 Electrocardiogram  
A standard 12- lead ECG will be recorded  after the patient has been resting for at least 5  minutes 
in the supine position. Safety ECGs should be reviewed by a medically qualified designated personnel at the site.  
Baseline ECGs will be performed at screening . Study Day 4 ECGs will be collected immediately 
after completion of the cefepime/VNRX -5133 or cefepime/VNRX-5133 placebo  infusion. 
Additional ECGs can be performed for safety reasons at any time as clinically indicated at the 
discretion of the investigator. Abnormalities should be followed up by the investigator. Copies of the ECGs should be kept as source documents. 
7.8.4 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
All blood and urine spe cimens will be sent to a central reference laboratory for analysis and 
testing. Blood and urine samples will be obtained during screening , on Study Days 4 and Study 
Days  8 and 12 if on IV treatment, and at EOT, TOC, and LFU visits . At screening , blood and

Results of any radiologic tests performed that are  clinically relevant to the cUTI or a n SAE 
should be recorded for all patients.  
7.9.6 Surgical P rocedures and O ther Non-pharmacological I nterventions  
Any patient planning to undergo surgical treatment not compatible with the aims of the study 
must not be enrolled. For patients who need to undergo an unplanned surgical procedure during the study, the reason for the surgery must be documented as an AE in the eCRF.  
Other non- pharmacological procedures that occur during the study will be entered into the eCRF 
including the date and reason for treatment/procedure. 
7.10 Pharmacokinetics  
Sparse plasma sampling for population PK analysis will be performed in all patients on 
Study Days 1, 2, and 3.  
PK blood samples will be taken via an indwelling IV catheter or by direct venipuncture into 
dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid  (K
2-EDTA) -containing tubes. To ensure that 
accurate PK samples are obtained, the IV infusion site used for study drug administration must not be used for collection of blood for PK assessments, and it should not be drawn from the same arm as the line used for infusion.  
PK blood samples should be taken relative to the st art/end of the 2 -hour infusion of 
cefepime/VNRX -5133 or placebo. Samples will be  collected around the scheduled sampling time 
within the specified collection windows. The sites are encouraged to vary the sampling within the collection windows, at times convenient for the collection. The exact dates and times of

8.1 Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans whether 
or not considered drug related.  
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure that 
may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or procedure. AE definitions will be followed as stated in the “Note for Guidance on Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and S tandards for Expedited Reporting” (International Council on Harmonisation 
[ICH] topic E2A).
7 
8.1.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any unt oward medical occurrence that, on the basis of medical and scientific 
judgment, has any of the following characteristics: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (This refers to an event in which the patient is at risk of death at the 
time of the event ; it do es not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it w as more severe) 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization for a medical reason or prolongation of existing hospitalization (T his refers to hospital admission required for treatment of the  AE. Note: 
this does not include confinement in, for example, a respite unit, a skilled nursing unit, rehabilitation facility, the clinical research unit, or confinement due to planned or unplanned reason unrelated to study) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth d efect  
• Is a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to c onduct 
normal life functions  
• Is an important medical event (Note: important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above should also usually be considered serious) 
The intensity and causality of SAEs will be determined as described in Sect ion 8.3.1 and 
Section  8.3.2, respectively. 
Protocol VNRX -5133 -201 Amendment 2  VNRX -5133  
Cefepime/VNRX -5133 for the Treatment of  cUTI  VenatoRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
   
Confidential  Page 77 of 101   8.2 Documenting Adverse Events 
All AEs and SAEs encountered during the clinical study will be reported in detail in the source 
documents and documented in the eCRF from the time of consent until completion of the LFU visit.  
Events occurring over the previous 5 years prior to the time of informed consent will be recorded as medical and surgical history. Any medical occurrences that are new or worsened from the time of informed consent and up to and including the last study visit must be reported as AEs and SAEs.  
Whenever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and symptoms should be reported. Each AE or SAE reported will be assessed for intensity. The date and time of onset, time relationship to dosing, and duration and outcome of each event will be noted. 
Information to be collected for AEs includes event description, date of onset, assessment of 
severity and relationship to study product, and date of resolution of the event, seriousness, and outcome. AEs occurring during the collection and reporting period will be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. AEs  will be followed until resolution, stabilization with 
sequelae, or death.  
8.2.1 Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
SAEs will be collected  from the time of informed consent through the last study visit. SAEs that 
are ongoing at the time of the LFU visit will be followed until resolution, stabilization with 
sequelae, or death. SAEs that begin after the patient’s participation in the study is complete, but that the investigator considers to be related to study drug, should be reported. 
The investigator or study site personnel should notify the appropriate sponsor/contract research organization (CRO) pharmacovigilance representatives  of all SAEs , regardless of relationship to 
study drug, within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. The investigator or study site personnel will provide the initial notification by completing the SAE page in the eCRF, which 
must include the investigator ’s assessm ent of the relationship of the event to study drug  and must 
be signed by the investigator. There may be situations in which minimal information is available. However, it is very important that the investigator always makes an assessment of causality. The investigator may change his/her assessment of the causality based on follow-up information and should amend the SAE report form accordingly. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. 
Covance Pharmacovigilance will forward SAE queries directly to the investigator requesting 
additional information. It is the investigator’s responsibility to be diligent in providing this information as soon as it is available.  
If an event meets serious criteria and it is not possible to access the EDC, the SAE should be submitted electronically using th is email address: SAEintake@covance.com. If email access is

• Latin America: +1 609 419 2609 
• Asia Pacific: +61 2 9888 8322 
8.3 Assessment of Adverse Events 
8.3.1 Assessment of Intensity  
The severity of AEs will be assessed  as mild , moderate, or severe according to the criteria below:  
• Mild: patient has awareness of signs or symptoms, but they are easily tolerated and of minor irritant type causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not require treatment or medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are trans ient. 
• Moderate: event introduces a low level of inconvenience or concern to the patient and may interfere with daily activities but is usually improved by simple therapeutic measures; the event may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe: event in terrupts the patient’s normal daily activities and generally requires 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment; the event may be incapacitating.  
It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of severity: thus, a severe AE is not necessarily serious. F or example, itching for several days may be rated as severe but may not be clinically 
serious.  
8.3.2 Assessment of Causality  
The investigator will assess the causal relationship between study drug and each AE and answer “yes” or “no” to the question “Do you cons ider that there is a reasonable possibility that the 
event may have been caused by the study drug ?” 
8.4 Adverse Event Follow -up 
Follow- up of AEs will continue until resolution, stabilization  with sequelae, or death. In case of 
ongoing AEs at the moment of data base lock, the data obtained at the moment of database lock 
will be used in the statistical analysis.  
8.5 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
There are currently no AEs of special interest.

Confidential  Page 79 of 101   8.6 Exemptions from Adverse Event Reporting  
8.6.1 Laboratory Abnormalities 
Laboratory abnormalities should be reported as adverse events if the result is considered to be 
clinically significant by the investigator.  Clinically significant abnormal clinical laboratory 
findings or other abnormal assessments that are associated with the disease being  studied (unless 
judged by the investigator as more severe than expected for the patient’s condition) or that are present or detected at the start of the study and do not worsen, will not be reported as AEs. 
8.6.2 Disease Progression and Lack of Effect  
Disease progression or deterioration of the patient’s condition due to lack of improvement or 
worsening of the cUTI may or may not reflect failure of the study drug. Insufficient therapeutic effect will be captured as an efficacy outcome. Therefore,  clinical and microbiologic al failures 
should not be reported as an AE. Further more , any event or extended hospitalization that is 
unequivocally due to disease progression should not be reported as an SAE unless it is believed that study drug actively contributed to the progression of the disease (i.e., not by way of insufficient therapeutic effect). Events that are a direct result of progression of the cUTI that progress to death will not be reported as SAEs but will instead be reported on a separate death  
form.

Confidential  Page 80 of 101   9 OTHER REPORTABLE EVE NTS  
9.1 Abnormal Liver Enzymes  
The investigator is responsible for notifying the sponsor or sponsor representative within 
24 hours of becoming aware of either of the following findings based on local or central 
laboratory testing results:  
• AST or ALT ≥3× ULN and total bilirubin ≥2× ULN , OR  
• ALT or AST ≥10× ULN 
In cases meeting either of the above criteria (based on central or local laboratory results), the invest igator must complete the liver enzyme eCRF. Appendix 3 describes the recommended 
diagnostic test that should be considered. If any diagnostic testing is performed, the results should be reported in the eCRF. Liver laboratory results should be followed locally over several days until resolution or stabilization of the laboratory abnormalities and should be documented in 
the local laboratory eCRF.  
If a nonserious or serious AE is associated with the laboratory abnormalities, it should be reported separately as described in Section 8. 
9.2 Overdose  
Overdose is defined as administration of more than the intended dose in any given infusion of 
study drug or more than 4 infusions of study drug in a given 24-hour period. Any instance of overdose (suspected or confirmed) must be communicated to the sponsor or a specified designee within 24 hours and be fully documented. Overdose is not necessarily an AE, but if the consequences of the overdose result in a serious or nonserious AE, they should be reported as such, separate from the overdose. Details of any signs or symptoms and their management should be recorded including details of any antidote(s) administered. 
9.3 Pregnancy Reporting  
A female clinical study patient may no longer receive the study drug and must immediately 
inform the investigator if she becom es pregnant during the study. Monitoring of the patient 
should continue until the outcome of the pregnancy is known. 
The investigator should report all pregnancies of female clinical study  patients or partners of 
male patients to the sponsor within 24  hours of becoming aware of them. The investigator should 
report all pregnancies to the IRB /independent ethics committee ( IEC). 
If written consent is obtained from the pregnant partner, monitoring of the partner should 
continue until the outcome of the pregnancy is known.

Confidential  Page 81 of 101   10 STATISTICS  
10.1 General Procedures  
Continuous clinical variables will be summarized descriptively (i.e., patient count, mean, 
standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum). Categorical data will be summarized descriptively with frequencies and percentages based on the number of patients exposed within a 
treatment.  Full details of the analysis will be described in the statistical analysis plan.  
For the evaluation of clinical and microbiologi cal response, missing data will be classif ied as 
indete rminate . Further details will be provided for the handling of all missing data in the 
statistical a nalysis p lan. 
10.2 Sample Size  
The study will randomize 582 patients with cUTI into 2 groups in a 2:1 ratio (388 patients to 
cefepime/VNRX -5133; 194 patients to meropenem ) at multiple study sites worldwide. 
Approximately 30% or more of patients should be diagnosed with AP. Randomization at study 
entry will be stratified by the type of infection (AP only versus complicated lower UTI with or without AP ) and by region ( North America and Western Europe versus Eastern Europe versus 
rest of the world ). Patients with prior antibacterial use  for cUTI will be limited to approximately 
25% of the study population. 
This sample size will provide at least 264 cef epime/VNRX-5133 patients and 132 meropenem 
patients for the primary comparisons of interest, based on an anticipated evaluability rate of 68%, 
a response rate of 75%, 90% power, a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, and a noninferiority margin of 15%.

function category, and presence of bacteremia will also be summarized by treatment group.  
10.3.3 Signs and Symptoms  
Signs and symptoms including frequency, urgency, dysuria, suprapubic/pelvic pain, and flank pain will be summarized f or each dose group at each time point with descriptive statistics as 
detailed in Section  10.1. 
10.3.4 Primary Endpoint  
The primary clinical efficacy endpoint in this  study is the proportion of cUTI patients with 
microbiological and symptomatic clinical success at TOC in the microITT  population.  
The aim of the analysis is to demonstrate that cefepime/VNRX -5133 is noninferior to 
meropenem with respect to this primary endpoint. 
The response rate will be calculated for each treatment group as the number of successes divided 
by the total number of patients (success + failure + indeterm inate). The difference in response 
rates between treatments (VNRX-5133 minus meropenem) will be presented along with a 95% confidence interval ( CI), calculated using the method of Miet tinen and Nurminen.
8 If the 
lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in response is greater tha n or equal to the 
noninferiority margin of -15%, noninferiority will be declared. Further, if noninferority  is 
concluded a test for superiority will be conducted. In this case, if the  lower limit of the  95% CI 
for the difference in response is greater than or equal to  zero superiority will be concluded. 
A sensitivity analyses stratified by the the pre- specified stratificati on factors will also be 
performed for the primary endpoint. In addition, a sensitivity analysis will be performed which will define any additional antibacterial therapy given for cUTI as a symptomatic  clinical failure.  
10.3.5 Secondary Endpoint s 
The secondary clinical and microbiological efficacy endpoints are detailed in Section  3.2.2.

primary endpoint ( see Section  10.3.4) and secondary (clinical, per-patient and per-pathogen 
microbiological response) endpoints . Other by-pathogen data presentati ons will be summarized 
by frequency counts but not analyzed. 
Additional analyses including sensitivity analyses using other visits or other poulations will be 
specified in the SAP.  
10.3.6 Analysis of Safety  
All safety analyses will be conducted in the safety population and will be summarized by treatment received . 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed based on the incidence and severity of AEs  and SAEs , 
exposure, mortality, reasons for discontinuation of study drug and study withdrawal , vital sign 
measurements, and clinically significant changes in clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, 
and coagulation laboratory values . 
Mortality rates will be presented by treatment group. 
10.3.6.1 Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory A ctivities (MedDRA). A 
treatment- emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined  as an AE that occurs during or after 
treatment through the last study visit . 
The incidence of TEAEs and SAEs will be summarized by treatment, by treatment and 
relationship, and by treatment and severity. The incidence will be presented by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT); SOC, PT, and relationship to study drug administration; 
and SOC, PT, and severity. Tables of any TEAE resulting discontinuation of study drug and SAEs will also be provided.  
10.3.6.2 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical labora tory data (i.e., clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and coagulation 
parameters) will be listed and summarized by assessment  and by timepoint including the actual 
value and change from baseline, and parameters outside the reference range will be noted.  The 
number and percent of patients with treatment- emergent potentially clinically significant (PCS) 
laboratory values will be tabulated for each treatment group. PCS will be defined based on 
pre-specified criteria outlined in the statistical analysis plan . Plots of laboratory values versus 
time for key laboratory parameters will also  be provided.  
Liver enzymes will be classified as >3×, >5×, and >10× ULN, and the number and percentage of patients with any postbaseline value in one of the categories will be presented by treatment group.

Descriptive statistics of vital sign measurements will be presented by treatment group and study 
assessment, as well as the change from baseline at each study visit.  
10.3.6.4 Exposure  
Exposure to study drug is defined as administration of any amount of study drug. The number of days of treatment and the total dose of treatment received per patient will be summarized.  
Enrollment and withdrawals from the study and from study drug will be summarized by treatment group. 
10.3.7 Analysis of Pharmacokinetics  
The population PK  analysis methods using data from the study will be described in a population 
PK analysis plan that will be finalized before clinical database lock. The population PK analysis 
plan will describe the analysis population, methods, and reporting for the population PK analysis. The population PK modeling will be summarized in a separate report.  
10.3.8 Resolution of Fever  
The time to first defervescence (≤37.8°C) in the microITT population for patients who have 
fever (>38°C) at baseline will be assessed  as an exploratory endpoint . 
The time to first defervescence will be assessed for patients in the specified study populations who have fever (>38ºC) at baseline, where defervescence (≤37.8ºC) is defined as the absence of fever based on the highest temperature recorded on each study day.  
Time to first defervescence data will be summarized as the mean, median, minimum, and 
maximum number of days and number of patients. Data will also be presented as the frequency of patients achieving defervescence by day for each study day.

Confidential  Page 90 of 101   13 AMENDMENTS  
Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to study patients, may be 
made only by the sponsor. A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients may be implemented immediately, provided the IRB/IEC is notified within 5 days. 
Any permanent change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. The written 
amendment must be su bmitted to the IRB/IEC and the investigator must await approval before 
implementing the changes. The sponsor will submit protocol amendments to the appropriate regulatory authorities for approval. 
If in the judgment of the IRB/IEC, the investigator, CRO, and/or the sponsor, the amendment to 
the protocol substantially changes the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the patient and/or has an impact on the patient ’s involvement as a study participant, the currently 
approved written ICF  will require similar modification. In such cases, informed consent will be 
renewed for patients enrolled in the study before continued participation.

This questionnaire asks about symptoms you might be suffering from due to your current urinary 
tract infection . Some symptoms that we will ask about can be caused by health problems other 
than a urinary tract infection. That’s why we want to know what you experience when you do not 
have a urinary tract infection.  
You may have some of these symptoms when you don’t have a urinary tract infection . In some 
cases, you may have some of these symptoms, but they could have gotten worse with your urinary tract infection .  
Please respond whether you have had any of the following symptoms before the start of your current urinary tract infection started and how severe those symptoms were.  In other words, tell 
us whether you have any of these symptoms when you are not suffering from a urinary tract infection. 
Answer each question by choosing only one response from the following possible options: no 
symptoms, mild symptoms, moderate symptoms, or severe symptoms. When answering these questions, don’t think about how you feel now. Think about how you felt before the start of your current urinary tract infection .

Confidential  Page 101 of 101   APPENDIX 3.  RECOMMENDED LABORATORY TESTING IN PATIENTS WITH 
ELEVATED LIVER ENZYM ES 
The investigator is responsible for notifying the sponsor or sponsor representative within 
24 hours of becoming aware of either of the following based on local or central laboratory testing results:  
• AST or ALT ≥ 3× ULN and total bilirubin ≥ 2× ULN, OR  
• AST or ALT ≥ 10× ULN 
When the investigator indicates that either of these criteria have been met in the EDC system (Medidata/RA VE™), an automatic notification will be sent to the Covance PV  & DSS team.  
In all cases, the investigator should: 
• Assess the patient for risk factors for liver enzyme abnormalities (e.g., heavy alcohol use, history of intravenous drug use, hypertriglyceridemia, history of hepatitis B or C infection, other) 
• Evaluate for signs and symptoms of liver disease, including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain or tenderness, fever, or rash 
• Re-evaluate liver enzymes (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin [total, direct, 
and indirect]) at a local laboratory until resolution or stabilization. The suggested frequency is approximately every 24 to 48 hours until enzyme abnormalities have improved and less often thereafter until resolution or stabilization. The local laboratory 
results should be documented in the local laboratory eCRF.  
In addition, the following recommended diagnostic tests may be considered: 
Hepatitis A (IgG, IgM)  Antinuclear antibodies  
Hepatitis B (HBsAb, HBcAb, HBeAg, HBsAg, HBV  DNA) Antimitochondrial antibodies  
Hepatitis C (HCV Ab, HCV RNA)  Iron studies (serum iron, serum ferritin, total 
iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation)  
Cytomegalovirus serology  Liver ultrasound  
Epstein -Barr virus serology   
DNA=deoxyribonucleic acid; HBcAb=hepatitis B core antibody; HBeAg=hepatitis B e antigen; HBsAb=hepatitis B; 
HBsAg=hepatitis B surface antibody; HBV=hepatitis B virus; HCV Ab=hepatitis C virus antibody; HCV  RNA=hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid; Ig=immunog lobulin.

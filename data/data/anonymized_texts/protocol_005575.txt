Etokimab for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis Version 2.0 
Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019   
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  ii SUMMARY OF CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS VERSION 
One global protocol amendment and 3 country-specific amendments have been issued since the original 
protocol was issued on 19 March 2018 (see below). 
 
Version Date  
Original Protocol  19 March 2018 
Global Protocol Amendments: 
Amendment 2  23 October 2018 
Country-specific Protocol Amendments: 
Amendment 1 (Czech Republic)  01 August 2018 
Amendment 1 (Germany)  31 July 2018 
Amendment 1 (UK)  20 June 2018 
 
Refer to Appendix A for Amendment 2 revisions and for all Amendment 1 revis ions.  
Substantive changes to Amendment 3, a global protocol amendment, are summarized in Table 1 .  
The ov
erall rationale for this amendment reflects an update in statistical approach to the data analysis for 
this study. A hierarchical listing according to priority testing procedure will be employed for the primary 
and secondary endpoints, and thus, the secondary endpoints have been reorganized. Some previously 
secondary endpoints have become exploratory endpoints, and some previously exploratory endpoints 
have become secondary endpoints and clarifying time points for analysis have been added to some 
endpoints. In addition, an interim analysis has been introduced for the analysis of efficacy data at 
Week 16. The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change in EASI score from Baseline to Week 16. 
The interim analysis will be performed once all subjects have completed the Week 16 visit and will 
comprise all efficacy data collected through Week 16 and all safety data collected as of the date of data 
cut-off. These updates and others are summarized in Table  1.

Synopsis 
Section 3 Re-ordered secondary and exploratory 
endpoints. Added clarifying time points to 
some endpoints. Added the safety and 
tolerability endpoints to the synopsis. Added 
additional endpoints of: 
 Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse 
events 
 Adverse events leading to discontinuation 
of study drug 
 Adverse events resulting in death To align with changes to the statistical 
analyses 
Synopsis Added sample size and statistical methods 
sections to the synopsis Standard synopsis sections to note key 
statistical considerations. 
Section 3 Revised the PK endpoints description for 
clarity Increased clarity for SAP 
Section 4.4 Revised the definition of the end of study. Revised for clarity. 
Section 6.5.2 
Section 7.2 
Section 9.5.4 Clarified definition of rescue 
medication/therapy and how subjects who 
receive rescue medication are to be handled. 
Clarified that systemic rescue medication is a 
reason for withdrawal from treatment. Increased clarity and instruction for study 
centers. Defines nonresponders for data 
analysis.

Section 9.5.4 
Section 9.6 
Section 9.6.1 
Section 9.6.2 
Section 9.6.4 
Section 9.6.5 These sections were significantly revised and 
re-ordered to reflect changes in the approach 
to statistical analysis for this study. Secondary 
efficacy endpoints now reflect a hierarchical 
testing procedure and other sections have been 
compressed or renamed to reflect the 
comprehensive update to the statistical 
analysis for this study.  A hierarchical testing procedure will be 
employed for the primary and secondary 
endpoints, and thus, the secondary endpoints 
have been reorganized. Some previously 
secondary endpoints have become 
exploratory endpoints, and some previously 
exploratory endpoints have become 
secondary endpoints. Because of the 
comprehensive nature of the change to the 
statistical approach, the text of the statistical 
analysis sections required significant 
changes. 
Section 9.3 
(formerly Section 
9.2) Removed the ITT analysis set and revised the 
definitions of other analysis sets. Changes to the analysis sets made in 
conjunction with the changes to the 
statistical analyses. 
Section 9.7 
(formerly Section 
9.6) An interim analysis has been added  The interim analysis was added in 
preparation for dose selection in the Phase 3 
study. 
Section 9.7.1 This section, formerly titled Tabulation of 
Individual Participant Data has been deleted. This standalone section was removed as 
superfluous and information regarding the 
tabulation of individual participant data is 
covered in other sections. 
Section 10.1.2 Added text that failure of the investigator to 
comply with ICH-GCP guidelines and FDA 
guidelines/regulations may result in early 
closure of the study center. Added for completeness and clarity. 
Section 10.1.5 Updated Medical Monitor The Sponsor Medical Monitor for this study 
has changed, so the protocol has been 
updated to reflect the new Medical Monitor 
information. 
Section 10.1.6 Updated DSMB information With the addition of the Week 16 interim 
analysis, subsets of data review provided to 
the DSMB are clarified. 
Section 10.1.9.2 Clarified that study records should not be 
destroyed without prior authorization from the 
Sponsor. Revised for clarity and completeness. 
Section 10.1.10 Added a list of protocol deviations that may 
affect the primary analysis The major protocol deviations according to 
ICH guidelines have been added, any 
additional deviations will be determined per 
discussion at the time of data review prior to 
database lock. 
Section 10.4 Removed Section 10.4  Improved information flow.

AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  2 1  PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
1.1 SYNOPSIS  
Title: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group, 
Dose-Ranging Study Investigating the Efficacy, Safety, and 
Pharmacokinetic Profile of ANB020 Administered to Adult Subjects with 
Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis 
Short Title: Efficacy, Safety, and Pharmacokinetic Profile of ANB020 in Adults with 
Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis 
Protocol Number:  ANB020-005 
Study Description: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, dose 
ranging, Phase 2b study designed to assess the efficacy of different doses 
and dose regimens of ANB020 (etokimab) compared to placebo in adult 
subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). This study will 
also assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
etokimab. This study will monitor the effects of etokimab on moderate to 
severe AD subjects over a period of 24 weeks. 
The study will have a screening period of up to 4 weeks (Week -4 to 0) 
prior to administration of study drug on Day 1, treatment period of 16 
weeks (Week 0 to 16), and safety follow-up period of 8 weeks (Week 16 to 
24). 
During the screening period, all subjects will undergo evaluation for 
eligibility. The subjects will be randomized on Day 1 to one of the 
following 5 treatment arms in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio: 
• Etokimab 20 mg subcutaneous (SC) every 4 weeks (Q4W) 
• Etokimab 300 mg load + 150 mg SC Q4W 
• Etokimab 300 mg load + 150 mg SC every 8 weeks 
• Etokimab 600 mg load + 300 mg SC Q4W 
• Placebo 
The subjects will be administered study drug SC during onsite visits on 
Day 1 (Week 0), Day 29 (Week 4), Day 57 (Week 8), and Day 85 (Week 
12). The subjects will remain on site for 2 hours for postdose assessments at 
Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12. Additional visits will occur at Day 5 (Week 1), 
Day 15 (Week 2), Day 92 (Week 13), and Day 113 (Week 16) during the 
treatment period. 
For the safety follow-up visit, the subject will return to the study center on 
Day 141 (Week 20) and Day 169 (Week 24). The End of Study (EOS) visit 
will be on Day 169 (Week 24) (see Section 1.3 ). 
The s
ubject’s disease activity (response to study treatment) will be 
evaluated using the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), Validated 
Investigator’s Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD), and 
Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) assessments. The patient reported 
outcome measurements (Patient Oriented Eczema Measure [POEM], 
Asthma Control Questionnaire-6 [ACQ-6], and Dermatology Life Quality 
Index [DLQI]) will be performed first at visits mentioned in the Schedule 
of Activities (SOA) (see Section 1.3 ) before any other study procedures 
(except informed consent at screening visit). Dermatology Life Quality 
Etokimab for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis Version 2.0 
Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  3 Index and POEM questionnaire will be administered only to the subset of 
subjects who can read and understand a language in which questionnaire is 
presented (based on availability of validated translations in participating 
countries). The ACQ-6 will be assessed only in subjects with active asthma 
disease whose primary language is (based on availability of validated 
translations in participating countries). The numerical rating scale (NRS) 
for pruritus, also a patient reported outcome measurement, will be 
completed daily via an electronic patient reported outcomes (ePRO) device. 
Serum samples for PK and immunogenicity will be collected before the 
administration of study drug and at the other time points specified in the 
SOA (see Section 1.3 ). 
Safet y
 assessments including adverse event (AE)/serious adverse event 
(SAE) monitoring, vital signs, physical examination, electrocardiograms 
(ECGs), and laboratory measurements will be performed as specified in 
SOA (see  Section 1.3 ). A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be 
instit
uted to periodically review and evaluate the study data for subject’s 
safety and advise the Sponsor of potential safety signals (see  Section 
10.1.6 ).

Description of 
Sites/Facilities 
Enrolling Participants: Approximately 83 investigators and study centers across the United States, 
Canada, and Europe are expected to participate in this study.  
Approximately 300 subjects will be randomly assigned to study treatment 
for an estimated total of approximately 60 evaluable subjects per treatment 
group. 
Description of Study 
Intervention: Etokimab or matching placebo for SC injection: 
 Sterile etokimab in single-use glass vials; each vial will contain 
100 mg/mL of etokimab 
 Sterile placebo in single-use glass vials; each vial will contain no 
active drug product 
See Figure 1  for dosing regimen.  
Stu
dy Duration: Study duration will last approximately 12 months.  
Participant Duration: The study will have a screening period of up to 4 weeks (Weeks -4 to 0), 
treatment period of 16 weeks (Week 0 to 16), and safety follow-up period 
of 8 weeks (Week 16 to 24). 
Sample Size The expected efficacy response (and variability) for active and placebo 
response (related with percent change from Baseline in EASI score to 
Week 16) was estimated after review of 5 previous studies in subjects with 
moderate-to-severe AD subjects not taking topical corticosteroids.  
In this way, a total sample of approximately 300 subjects (60 subjects per 
treatment arm) achieves more than 95% power to detect differences among 
the means versus the alternative of equal means using an F test with a 
0.05000 significance level. The size of the variation in the means is 
represented by their standard deviation which is 18.59. The common 
standard deviation within a group is assumed to be 50.00. 
The hypothesized means used to compute the sample size derived from the 
studies mentioned before are: -20 -44. -65.4 -66.4 -68 (for placebo and each 
active treatment arm respectively) with a covariate R-squared of 0.300.

AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  9 2  INTRODUCTION 
 
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  
Current therapy for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) is limited. Typical treatment modalities 
include nonsystemic treatment with emollients, topical corticosteroids, topical phosphodiesterase 
4 inhibitors, and topical calcineurin inhibitors. The majority of patients achieve disease control with these 
standard nonsystemic treatments. However, due to disease severity, treatment-related adverse reactions, 
or other factors, some patients do not achieve adequate disease control. Thus, there is need for long-term 
therapeutic control in moderate to severe AD. The IL-33 plays an important role in T-helper 2 
(Th2)-mediated cellular immunity, and in the pathogenesis of AD.1,2,3 It functions as a pleiotropic 
infla
mmatory cytokine orchestrating a diverse array of cellular immune responses and potently drives 
production of Th2 cell associated cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
targeting such cytokines might represent a novel approach to control AD. Etokimab is a humanized mAb 
that specifically neutralizes human IL-33, thereby blocking the interaction of IL-33 with the IL-33 
receptor, ST2, and subsequently inhibiting IL-33 driven downstream signaling and cellular responses. 
Targeting IL-33 with etokimab should impact the downstream Th2 cell cytokines involved in AD 
pathogenesis, and may provide a novel beneficial therapy to subjects with AD. This study is designed to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of etokimab in subjects with moderate to 
severe AD.  
2.2 BACKGROUND  
2.2.1  BACKGROUND OF DISEASE 
Atopic dermatitis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects both children and adults 
with a prevalence of 30% and 10%, respectively .4 The hallmarks of AD are chronic, relapsing episodes of 
skin i
nflammation with disturbance of epidermal barrier function that culminates in dry skin.5 AD is often 
assoc
iated with elevated serum immunoglobulin (IgE) levels and a personal or family history of Type 1 
allergies, allergic rhinitis, or asthma.6 The etiology of AD is not entirely understood but involves a 
multi
plicity of factors, including skin barrier abnormalities, defects in innate immunity response, Th2-
skewed adaptive immune response, and altered skin resident microbial flora. AD is often associated with, 
or is a prelude to the development of asthma, and other allergic diseases. The combination of these 
conditions and their interleaved progression has been defined as the atopic march. The interconnectivity 
among all these conditions, forming the atopic march, suggests that common pathogenic mechanisms are 
shared amongst all these conditions. In this context, growing evidence indicates that IL-33 is one of the 
key initiators of this shared pathogenic cascade. 
Current therapies for AD have limited efficacy in moderate to severe disease and most are focused on 
topical treatments such as corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. Majority of the subjects achieve 
disease control with these standard nonsystemic treatments. However, there is a significant need for new 
effective systemic therapies for AD that is not controlled with optimal topical therapy. Biologics have 
been considered for the treatment of subjects with severe AD. Dupilumab, an mAb that blocks the action 
of the Th2 cytokines, IL-4, and IL-13, has been tested in clinical studies in AD. The results of these 
clinical studies have indicated that this mAb provided reduction in the signs and symptoms of disease and 
Etokimab for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis Version 2.0 
Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  10 led to its approval for the treatment of AD in the United States and European Union. This is encouraging 
for the development of etokimab, which targets IL-33, upstream of IL-4, IL-13, and other Th2 cytokines. 
Etokimab would offer an additional treatment approach to this disease where there remains a need for 
novel effective therapies. 
2.2.2  BACKGROUND OF ETOKIMAB 
Etokimab has been adopted as the non-proprietary name for ANB020. Therefore, ANB020 will be 
referred to as etokimab, interchangeably, in this clinical study protocol.  
Etokimab is a first-in-class, anti-interleukin-33 therapeutic antibody to treat Th2 cell driven inflammatory 
diseases with underlying interleukin (IL)-33 dysregulation. Etokimab is a humanized immunoglobulin 
subtype G1/kappa (IgG1/kappa) mAb that specifically neutralizes the biological effects of human IL-33, a 
member of the IL-1 superfamily7 and a multifunctional cytokine that plays an important role in Th2 
med
iated cellular immunity and in the pathogenesis of atopic diseases.1,2 Etokimab binds to and inhibits 
the
 interaction of IL-33 with its specific cell surface receptor (ST2) thereby blocking IL-33 driven 
downstream signaling and subsequent cellular responses. It is being developed for the treatment of atopic 
diseases, such as eosinophilic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. 
2.2.2.1  NONCLINICAL STUDIES WITH ETOKIMAB 
Etokimab is being developed by AnaptysBio Inc. as a lead drug candidate and exhibits strong inhibitory 
activity for human as well as cynomolgus monkey IL-33. Nonclinical data obtained from studies with 
etokimab in primary human and cynomolgus monkey cells, and from in vivo nonhuman primate studies 
demonstrated that: 
• Etokimab shows reactivity with human and cynomolgus monkey IL-33 (dissociation constant of 
1 pM vs 37 pM, respectively), but not with mouse or rat IL-33. 
• In primary human and cynomolgus monkey cell populations, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
and human whole blood, etokimab inhibited IL-33 induced interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production. In 
human basophils, etokimab also inhibited IL-33 induced IL-5 production. 
• Etokimab can reduce eosinophilia in mice treated with human IL-33. 
• The observed serum apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2) of etokimab in cynomolgus monkeys was 
160
 hours after a single intravenous (IV) dose administration, and 187 hours after a single 
subcutaneous (SC) dose administration at 10 mg/kg, consistent with the anticipated PK characteristics 
for a human IgG1 scaffold mAb in the monkey. 
• A multiple dose, good laboratory practice compliant toxicology and toxicokinetic study (4- and 
13-week duration with recovery phase) has been conducted with etokimab administered by SC and 
intravenous (IV) injection to cynomolgus monkeys. These studies produced no significant test article 
related effects and established a No Observed Adverse Effect Level of 50 mg/kg, the highest dose 
tested.

advancing etokimab into clinical development. 
For detailed nonclinical experience with etokimab, refer to the Etokimab Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
2.2.2.2  CLINICAL STUDIES WITH ETOKIMAB 
Etokimab has been administered to humans in 2 phase 1 healthy volunteer studies (ANB020-001 and 
ANB020-BA-01) and a phase 2a proof-of-concept study (ANB020-002) in patients with moderate to 
severe AD. Detailed clinical experience with etokimab is provided in the Etokimab IB.  
2.2.2.2.1  STU DY ANB020-001 
Study ANB020-001 was a first-in-human (FIH), phase 1 study in healthy subjects. In the single ascending 
dose (SAD) phase of the study, 64 healthy subjects were enrolled into 8 treatment arms of 8 subjects each 
(6 etokimab + 2 placebo per treatment arm). Of these 64 subjects, 24 subjects received etokimab by SC 
injection (6 each at dose levels of 10, 40, 100, and 300 mg); 24 subjects received etokimab by IV infusion 
(6 each at dose levels of 40, 100, 300 and 750 mg); 8 subjects received placebo by SC injection; and 
8 subjects received placebo by IV infusion. In the single-dose portion of the study, etokimab was 
generally well tolerated in male and female healthy volunteers, ages 19 to 44 years of age, when 
administered as a single dose of etokimab of up to 300 mg SC and up to 750 mg IV. A total of 81% of 
subjects in the placebo group and 79% of subjects in the etokimab group had at least 1 treatment-
emergent adverse event (TEAE) during the study. The most commonly reported TEAEs were upper 
respiratory tract infection (etokimab 48%, placebo 50%), headache (etokimab 27%, placebo 31%), 
abdominal pain (etokimab 6%, placebo 0%), nausea (etokimab 4%, placebo 0%), vomiting (etokimab 4%, 
placebo 0%), urticaria (etokimab 4%, placebo 0%), and fatigue (etokimab 4%, placebo 0%). 
In the SAD cohort, 1 serious adverse event/suspected unexpected severe adverse reaction (SAE/SUSAR) 
occurred in a subject who was randomly assigned to etokimab (750 mg) as a single IV injection. The 
subject developed severe neutropenia (   on Day 22 post-dose. The neutrophils level remain e d 
clinically significantly low (  ) on Day 24, but the level returned to normal range b y Day 29. 
The subject reported to have had prodromal viral symptoms prior the neutropenia episode and clear 
clinical manifestations (adenoapathy) of an ongoing viral infection. This might indicate that concomitant 
(viral infection) factors could have triggered the neutropenia episode. However, it cannot be formally 
excluded that IL-33 neutralization might have had a contributing role in the neutropenic episode. 
The multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase of the study, 32 subjects were enrolled into 4 treatment arms 
of 8 subjects each (6 etokimab + 2 placebo per treatment arm). Of the 32 subjects enrolled, 18 subjects 
received etokimab by IV infusion (6 each at dose levels of 40, 100, and 300 mg weekly); 6 subjects 
received etokimab by SC injection (at a dose level of 100 mg weekly); 6 subjects received multiple doses 
of placebo by IV infusion; and 2 subjects received multiple doses of placebo by SC injection. In the 
multiple dose portion of the study, etokimab was well tolerated in healthy male and female adult 
volunteers ages 18 to 45 years, when administered once-weekly for 4 weeks at 100 mg SC and at up to 
300 mg as a multiple-dose IV. A total of 24 subjects (75%) had at least 1 TEAE, including, 5 of

etokimab, and 6 of 8 subjects (75%) following administration of placebo, with a total of 45 TEAEs.  
Most adverse events (AEs) were mild in severity (25 of 45 AEs, 56% of all AEs); 19 AEs (42%) were 
classified as moderate; and 1 AE was classified as severe (2%). Treatment-emergent AEs deemed to be 
related to study drug administration were reported in 17 of 32 subjects (53%). Of the TEAEs deemed to 
be related to study drug, 2 AEs were reported in 2 subjects (33%) who received etokimab SC, 14 AEs 
were reported in 11 subjects (61%) who received etokimab via IV infusion, and 4 AEs were reported in 
4 subjects (50%) who received placebo. Of the AEs deemed related to study drug, 8 AEs were mild in 
severity, 12 AEs were moderate in severity and 1 was considered severe.  
2.2.2.2.2  ST UDY ANB020-BA-01 
Study (ANB020-BA-01) was a phase 1 study to assessed PK, safety, and tolerability of a single 100 mg 
SQ or IV dose of etokimab (current new formulation compared to Study ANB020-001) in healthy male 
and female subjects. The PK results of Study ANB020-BA-01 are consistent with results of Study 
ANB020-001. Administration of a single dose of etokimab 100 mg SQ injection or IV infusion was safe 
and well-tolerated in healthy male and female subjects. There were no new or unexpected safety findings 
compared to Study ANB020-001.  
2.2.2.2.3  ST UDY ANB020-002  
Study ANB020-002 was a phase 2a, proof-of-concept, placebo-controlled, open-label study that evaluated 
the etokimab activity upon house dust mite skin challenge in 12 subjects with moderate to severe AD at a 
single center in the United Kingdom. This study was also conducted to assess the safety and tolerability 
of etokimab in patients with moderate to severe AD. 
All 12 subjects included in the Safety Analysis Set experienced at least 1 TEAE during the study. During 
the placebo period (from Day 1 to Day 8 prior to etokimab administration), 8 (66.7%) subjects 
experienced at least 1 TEAE and after administration of etokimab (on Day 8), 11 (91.7%) subjects 
experienced at least 1 TEAE. A total of 10 (83.3%) subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE considered 
related to etokimab by the Investigator. Only 1 (8.3%) subject experienced an SAE (exacerbation of 
pre-existing depression) after etokimab administration of severe intensity and considered to be unrelated 
to study drug. None of the subjects discontinued the study due to a TEAE. The most commonly reported 
TEAEs were dizziness and headache (3 subjects [25%] each) followed by upper respiratory tract 
infection, urinary tract infection, peripheral swelling, cough, and urticaria (2 subjects [16.7%] each).  
The mean total Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score decreased statistically significantly after 
the administration of etokimab. On Day 15, the mean total EASI score was 19.2 and the mean treatment 
difference from Baseline in the total EASI score was -10.8. On Day 22 and Day 36, the mean treatment 
difference from Baseline in the total EASI score was -16.3 (p-value<0.0001) and -17.5 (p-value=0.0008), 
respectively.

2.3.1  KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
Etokimab has been extensively tested in animals and there were no etokimab-related adverse findings. 
The administration of etokimab had no effect on hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, or 
urinalysis test results. Etokimab was found to be safe and well tolerated in a phase 1 study (ANB020-001) 
in healthy subjects. There were no deaths during the study. In the phase 1 SAD study, no change in vital 
signs (blood pressure [BP], heart rate [HR], electrocardiogram [ECG], or body temperature) were noted. 
Hematology parameters, such as erythrocyte, white blood cell and platelets counts were all within the 
normal range except in 1 volunteer in the 750 mg dose group who reported a SAE of neutropenia 
considered as possibly related to the study treatment. All others did not show any modification or trend 
related to etokimab dosing.  
Serum chemistry results were also all in the normal range. A total of 81% subjects in the placebo group 
and 79% subjects in the etokimab group had at least 1 TEAE during the study. The most commonly 
reported TEAEs of mild to moderate intensity included upper respiratory tract infection (50% versus 48% 
in placebo and etokimab group, respectively) and headache (32% versus 27% in placebo and ANB020 
group, respectively). Of all the AEs reported across all dose groups, 44% were reported as possible 
related and 36% were reported as unrelated. One SAE of decreased neutrophils was reported in the 
750 mg dose group which resolved prior to the study completion with no sequelae. No other observations 
of decreased neutrophils were observed. No dose dependent AE presentation was evident. 
There were no SAEs in MAD phase of the study. One severe AE of elevated transaminase was reported in 
the MAD phase of the study. Of the 32 subjects, 24 reported a total of 45 TEAEs; 5 of 6 subjects (83%) 
following SC administration, 13 of 18 subjects (72%) following IV administration, and 6 of 8 subjects 
(75%) following placebo administration. Most of the AEs were mild in severity (25 of 45 [56%] 
subjects), 19 (42%) AEs were considered moderate and 1 AE was classified as severe AE (2%). Of the 
32 subjects, 17 subjects (53%) reported TEAEs considered related to the study drug. Of these, 2 AEs were 
reported in 2 subjects (33%) who received etokimab via IV infusion and 4 AEs were reported in 
4 subjects who received placebo. The most commonly reported AEs were headache, upper respiratory 
tract infection, and abdominal pain. 
One SAE of hospitalization for depression (exacerbation of pre-existing depression) of severe intensity 
was reported in Study ANB020-002. A r-old  patient with a moderate to severe AD 
who experienced the SAE 157 days after receiving a single dose of etokimab 300 mg IV. The event was 
considered unlikely related to the study drug by the Investigator and Sponsor. 
Although there is no evidence to date for an allergic/anaphylactic reaction to etokimab, such a reaction to 
either the active protein or excipients is possible. Some symptoms of allergic reactions are rash, wheezing 
or difficulty breathing, dizziness or fainting (also a possible outcome of a drop in BP), swelling around 
the mouth, throat or eyes, a fast HR, or sweating. Subjects with true allergic/anaphylactic reactions should 
not receive further doses of the product. 
Monoclonal antibodies may also be associated with reactions that are clinically indistinguishable from 
true allergic/anaphylactic reactions, but which are mediated through direct release of cytokines or other 

Etokimab for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis Version 2.0 
Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  14 pro-inflammatory mediators. Such reactions may be termed infusion-related reactions. Infusion-related 
reactions typically occur with the first administration of a monoclonal antibody product and are generally 
less frequent and/or less severe with subsequent doses. 
Allergic/anaphylactic reactions and infusion-related reactions typically begin during, or within several 
hours of dose administration. The onset of symptoms may be rapid, and some reactions may be life 
threatening. Etokimab should be administered in an environment under close supervision of a physician 
and where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available. 
Resistance to the therapeutic effects of mAbs can occur in rare cases due to development of neutralizing 
antibodies by the patient's immune system. 
Details about specific risks for subjects in this clinical trial can be found in the etokimab IB and informed 
consent form (ICF). 
2.3.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
A subject with AD may or may not receive direct benefit from participating in this study. Details about 
specific benefits for subjects in this clinical study are provided in the Etokimab IB and ICF. 
Based upon the inhibition of IL-33 by the study drug and pre-clinical study and early phase 2 results, 
subjects with AD who are randomized to active treatment may benefit from treatment with etokimab. 
Participation in this study may help develop important scientific knowledge that could contribute to the 
development of a new novel medication to be used in the treatment of subjects who suffer from AD, 
asthma, and food allergies.

 Etokimab 300 mg load + 150 mg SC Q4W 
 Etokimab 300 mg load + 150 mg SC every 8 weeks (Q8W) 
 Etokimab 600 mg load + 300 mg SC Q4W 
 Placebo 
The subjects will be administered study drug SC during onsite visits on Day 1 (Week 0), Day 29 
(Week 4), Day 57 (Week 8), and Day 85 (Week 12). The subjects will remain on-site for 2 hours for 
postdose assessments at Weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12. Additional visits will occur at Day 5 (Week 1), Day 15 
(Week 2), Day 92 (Week 13), and Day 113 (Week 16) during the treatment period. 
For the safety follow-up visit, the subject will return to the study center on Day 141 (Week 20) and 
Day 169 (Week 24). The end of study (EOS) Visit will be on Day 169 (Week 24) (see  Section 1.3 ). 
The sub j
ect’s disease activity (response to study treatment) will be evaluated using the EASI, vIGA-AD, 
and SCORAD assessments. The patient reported outcome measurements (POEM, ACQ-6, and DLQI will 
be performed first at visits specified in the Schedule of Activities (SOA;see Section 1.3 ) before any other 
study p
rocedures (except informed consent at screening visit). Dermatology Life Quality Index and 
POEM questionnaires will be administered only to the subset of subjects who can read and understand a 
language in which questionnaire is presented (based on availability of validated translations in 
participating countries). The ACQ-6 will be assessed only in subjects with active asthma disease who can 
read and understand English. The NRS (numerical rating scale) for pruritus , also a patient reported 
outcome, will be completed daily via electronic patient reported outcome (ePRO) device. 
Serum samples for PK and immunogenicity will be collected before the administration of study drug and 
at the other time points specified in the SOA (see  Section 1.3 ). 
Safet y
 assessments including AE/SAE monitoring, vital signs, physical examination, ECGs, and 
laboratory measurements will be performed as specified in SOA (see Section 1.3 ). A Data Safety 
Monito
ring Board will be instituted to periodically review and evaluate the study data for subject’s safety 
and advise the Sponsor of potential safety signals. 
4.2 SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
Etokimab, is a first-in-class, anti-IL-33 therapeutic antibody developed to treat Th2 cell driven 
inflammatory diseases with underlying IL-33 dysregulation. Preliminary evidence of this compound’s 
significant pharmacodynamic (PD) activity in terms of cytokine modulation has been demonstrated in 
nonclinical and clinical studies, justifying its further development in subjects with AD. Subjects with 
moderate to severe AD often have inadequate disease control from currently available topical treatments 
and uncontrolled AD significantly affects their quality of life. Systemic immunomodulatory therapy 
including oral corticosteroids has been used to treat these subjects but have significant side effects. The 
use of more targeted immune modulators such as etokimab may reduce the Th2 specific inflammation

Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  19 triggering disease with fewer side effects. Other monoclonal Th2 immune modulators such as dupilumab 
have shown promising results in clinical studies.  
This study is a dose-ranging study aiming to assess the effects of etokimab compared to placebo in 
subjects with AD and provide evidence of a desired short-term clinical outcome. This study will use a 
placebo arm to allow for comparative efficacy assessments. Most of the subjects will be randomized to an 
active treatment arm. The t 1/2 of etokimab was approximately 2 weeks in phase 1 studies in healthy 
subje
cts. Following subjects for 8 weeks after the last etokimab administration will allow time for 
additional PK, and safety assessments. 
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DOSE 
Data from the phase 1 study (ANB020-001) and phase 2a study (ANB020-002) are the basis for the 
selection of dose of etokimab for the current study. The dose range of etokimab selected for this study has 
been used safely in Study ANB020-001. Etokimab pharmacodynamic activity, measured as inhibition of 
ex-vivo IL-33 stimulated INF-γ production, can be inferred from the correlation with PK data. All the 
selected dose levels of etokimab are predicted to induce full IL-33 inhibition within 2 days for at least 9 to 
10 days after dosing. The administration of the loading doses of etokimab will allow systemic 
concentrations to reach serum concentrations sustaining more than 95% IL-33 inhibition faster, and 
potentially reduce the time to onset of clinical effect. Data from the phase 2a study show a clinical 
response 1 week after etokimab administration (300 mg IV), and the dose was found to be safe and well 
tolerated. One month after etokimab administration, the average EASI score reduction was 61% and the 
average pruritus reduction was 32% relative to Baseline. Sustained clinical response was observed 
2 months after etokimab administration.  
4.4 END OF STUDY DEFINITION 
A subject is considered to have completed the study if he or she has completed all scheduled study visits, 
including the last visit on Day 169 (see Section 1.3 ) or the last scheduled assessment (see Section 6.7 ). 
The st
udy is considered completed at the time the last subject has undergone all procedures associated 
with the last visit.

6.2 PREPARATION/HANDLING/STORAGE/ACCOUNTABILITY 
 
6.2.1  ACQUISITION AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
The Investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for 
study treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and 
final disposition records). The Investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions 
have been maintained during transit for all study treatment received and any discrepancies are reported 
and resolved before use of the study treatment. 
Only subjects enrolled in the study may receive study treatment and only authorized study center staff 
may supply or administer study treatment. 
Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study treatment are provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual. 
Drug accountability forms must be available for inspection at any time. 
6.2.2  FORMULATION, APPEARANCE, PACKAGING, AND LABELING 
Etokimab is a sterile, white to slightly opalescent solution that is formulated at 100 mg/mL in 30 mM 
histidine, 240 mM proline, and 0.01% polysorbate 80 at pH 6.0. Each single-use vial contains 1.2 mL of 
solution.  
Etokimab for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis Version 2.0 
Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  26 Placebo is formulated as a sterile solution of 30 mM histidine, 240 mM proline, and 0.01% polysorbate 
80 at pH 6.0. Each single use glass vial contains 1.2 mL of solution.  
All investigational product vials will be packaged and labeled as required per country requirements. 
6.2.3  PRODUCT STORAGE AND STABILITY 
All study treatments must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or 
automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the Investigator 
and authorized study center staff. 
The etokimab vials must be refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) until the day of use. Etokimab vials 
may be stored at room temperature (>8°C to 25°C [46°F to 77°F]) for up to 8 hours. Once etokimab has 
been diluted with placebo, the solution may be stored at room temperature (>8°C to 25°C [46°F to 77°F]) 
for up to 8 hours. Etokimab may be stored at room temperature in the undiluted and/or diluted state for a 
maximum of 8 hours. Vials are intended for single-use only; therefore, any remaining solution should be 
discarded. 
6.2.4  PREPARATION  
Investigational product (study drug or placebo) will be prepared by a trained, unblinded dose preparer to 
maintain blinding of the study investigators and study subjects. Dose preparation records will be 
completed and securely maintained by the dose preparer. Both the etokimab and the placebo have the 
same appearance in the syringe, thereby ensuring that the Principal Investigator (PI) administering the 
study injections will remain blinded to study treatment. Syringes of etokimab and placebo will be 
prepared based on treatment group assignment.  
6.2.5  DOSING INSTRUCTIONS 
Study drug (etokimab and placebo) will be administered by SC route at 1.5 mL per injection. Etokimab 
will be administered by SC route at 100 mg/mL concentration: 
 Study drug (etokimab and placebo) should be prepared by drawing up the required dosing volume 
into suitable sized syringe and attaching a dosing needle. 
 Subcutaneous injection sites should be alternated among the different quadrants of the abdomen 
(avoiding navel and waist areas), upper thighs, and upper arms, so that the same site is not 
injected for 2 consecutive months.  
 To allow for adequate assessment of possible injection site reactions, study drug should be 
administered only into areas of normal looking skin; injections should be at least 2 inches (5 cm) 
apart.  
 The loading dose should be administered into at least two different locations (eg, different 
quadrants of the abdomen) to avoid administration of more than 2 injections into the same 
location. 
 Subcutaneous injections should not be given into moles, scars, tattoos or areas where the skin is 
tender, bruised, red, hard, or not intact.

AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  27 6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING 
6.3.1  RANDOMIZATION 
This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study with limited access to the randomization 
code. All subjects will be centrally assigned to randomized study treatment using an Interactive Web 
Response System (IXRS). As subjects become eligible they will be assigned sequential randomization 
numbers which will be used to assign the allocated treatment based on a randomization schedule. Before 
the study is initiated, the log in information and directions for the IXRS will be provided to each study 
center. Study treatment will be prepared and dispensed at the study visits by an unblinded pharmacist or 
designee as summarized in Section 6.1  and the Pharmacy Manual; the visits at which this wil l  occur are 
summarized in Section 1.3 . Returned study treatment should not be re dispensed t o the subjects. 
Eligible subjects will be randomized on Day 1 to one of the 5 treatment arms, ie, placebo or one of the 
treatment arms dosed with etokimab in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio. Etokimab and placebo will be identical in 
physical appearance. The Sponsor, Investigator, site staff, and subjects will be blinded to treatment 
assignment and only the unblinded pharmacist or designee (examples include a state/country approved 
physician, registered nurse, etc.) will be aware of treatment assignment (etokimab or placebo). The IXRS 
will be responsible for providing the randomization number to the unblinded pharmacist or designee. The 
treatment codes will be held by the Sponsor’s designated vendor. 
6.3.2  BLINDING 
The IXRS will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions. In case of an emergency, the Investigator 
has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a subject’s treatment assignment is warranted. 
Subject’s safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination and unblinding 
should be performed only if the subject’s well-being requires knowledge of the subject’s treatment 
assignment, or if requested by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). 
All entries resulting in an unblinding event are recorded and reported by the IXRS. If a subject’s 
treatment assignment is unblinded, the Sponsor must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind 
without informing the Sponsor of the treatment assignment. The date and reason that the blind was 
broken, but not the treatment assignment must be recorded in the source documentation and electronic 
case report form (eCRF), as applicable.

AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  28 6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION COMPLIANCE 
The assigned dosage, timing, and mode of administration may not be changed. Any departures from the 
intended regimen must be captured in the eCRFs and will be recorded as a protocol deviation. 
Subjects who miss 2 consecutive doses after the loading dose will be considered noncompliant and will 
be discontinued from the study. Missing the loading dose will also result in discontinuation from the 
study. 
6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY 
For this protocol, a prescription medication is defined as a medication that can be prescribed only by a 
properly authorized/licensed clinician. 
Any medication, moisturizer, or vaccine (including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, 
and/or herbal supplements) that the subject is receiving at the time of enrollment and during the study 
must be recorded on the eCRF.  
The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are any questions regarding concomitant or prior 
therapy. 
A list of excluded medications is provided in  Appendix D. 
6.5.1  ALLOWED MEDICATIONS 
Treatment with concomitant therapies for AD during the study is permitted only as outlined in the 
inclusion criteria (see Section 5.1 )/exclusion criteria (see Section 5.2 ) and as described below. Subjects 
taking  p
ermitted medications should be on stable doses at the baseline visit (Week 0, Day 1) as specified 
in Section 5.2 . 
• Throu
ghout the treatment period, subjects will continue to apply their daily routine emollient 
without any changes at least once daily to all dry areas. 
• Women of childbearing potential are to continue using a highly effective form of contraception 
throughout the study. 
• Medications used to treat chronic disease such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma are also 
permitted. 
The Investigator must record the use of all concomitant medications, both prescribed and over the 
counter, into the eCRF and subject’s medical records. This includes medications used on both a regular 
and an as needed basis. Subjects should be discouraged from starting any new medication, both 
prescribed and over the counter, without consulting the Investigator, unless the new medication is 
required for emergency use or has been prescribed for clinical need. If there is any question whether a 
medication may be used during the study the site should contact the Medical Monitor. 
A list of excluded medications/therapy is provided in  Appendix D .

AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  29 6.5.2  RESCUE MEDICINE 
The use of topical and systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressant/immunomodulating treatments and 
phototherapy or use of a tanning booth are prohibited during the course of the study ( Table 13 ). If any of 
these
 medications are needed to control intolerable AD symptoms, they may be given/utilized at the 
discretion of the Investigator and will be considered rescue medication/therapy. The Sponsor will not 
supply any rescue medication or support the cost of rescue therapy.  
Subjects who receive any exclusionary topical rescue treatment for more than 2 consecutive days, or for 
more than 3 days within two consecutive weeks, or for more than 6 days during the treatment period will 
be considered nonresponders; however, they are allowed to continue study treatment. Subjects who 
receive phototherapy rescue treatment or utilize tanning booths will be considered nonresponders, but will 
be allowed to continue study treatment. However, if a subject receives systemic rescue treatment, study 
treatment is to be immediately discontinued.  
All subjects who receive rescue medication/therapy should complete the study assessments according to 
Section 1.3 whether or not they continue study treatment. 
The d a
te and time of any rescue medication administration or treatment, as well as the name and dosage 
regimen of the rescue medication or treatment, must be recorded.  
Anti-inflammatory topical rescue therapy should be administered to lesional skin only. The choice of the 
corticosteroid should be based upon standard of care considerations (eg, body area involved, severity of 
skin inflammation). A list of representative topical corticosteroids is provided in Appendix E . Low 
poten
cy corticosteroids (Class 6/7) cream or ointment are suggested. For more severe inflammation, 
moderate potency corticosteroids (Class 4/5) are suggested. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (eg, tacrolimus 
0.1%) may be an alternative to TCS, in particular, for the treatment of the face, neck, and skin folds.  
6.6 DOSE MODIFICATION 
No dose modification is allowed in this study. Study treatment can be interrupted temporarily or 
permanently if deemed necessary as per the Investigator’s discretion. Any interruption should be 
discussed with the Medical Monitor in advance but no later than 24 hours after it has occurred. 
6.7 TREATMENT AFTER THE END OF THE STUDY 
All subjects will return to the study center for the EOS (Day 169) or early termination visit (ETV) for 
final safety and EOS assessments. After this visit, subjects should be treated according to the 
Investigator’s clinical judgment. Care after EOS/ETV will not be provided by the Sponsor. Any AE 
which in the opinion of the Investigator is related to the study drug, SAE, or pregnancy occurring within

AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  30 30 days after the EOS visit should be reported to the IQVIA Lifecycle Safety team and followed up until 
it has a resolved or stable outcome or subject is lost to follow-up. 
7 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT 
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL 
 
7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION 
Study treatment can be interrupted temporarily in case of an AE as per the Investigator’s discretion. The 
Medical Monitor should be informed. Restarting of study treatment at the next scheduled administration 
study visits can be done after discussion with the Medical Monitor. 
Discontinuation from study intervention does not mean discontinuation from the study, and remaining 
study procedures should be completed as indicated by the study protocol. If a clinically significant finding 
is identified (including, but not limited to changes from Baseline) after enrollment, the Investigator or 
qualified designee will determine if any change in participant management is needed. Any new clinically 
relevant finding will be reported as an AE. 
In case of early withdrawal from the study or if the subject has missed 2 consecutive doses following the 
Day 1 loading dose, the subject will be required to return to the study center for an ETV. Procedures 
should be completed in accordance with the SOA (see Section 1.3 ) Week 24/ETV. 
7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY 
The subject can be discontinued or withdrawn from study due to following reasons: 
 A subject may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor for safety (eg, 
occurrence of an AE or SAE or a protocol deviation), lack of efficacy, behavioral, lack of 
compliance, or administrative reasons. Prior to study drug administration, the Investigator 
decides that the subject should be withdrawn or is at risk. If this decision is made because of 
an AE or a clinically significant laboratory value, the study drug should not be administered , 
and a p
propriate measures are to be taken. AnaptysBio Inc. and/or IQVIA is to be notified 
immediately. 
 Lost to follow-up. 
 An anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction. 
 Occurrences of emergency unblinding. 
 Use of any excluded/prohibited medications (see Appendix D ) that in the opinion of the 
Inves
tigator or Sponsor necessitates the subject being withdrawn. 
 Laboratory abnormalities: 
o ALT or AST >5 times ULN for more than 2 weeks. 
o ALT or AST >3 times ULN AND bilirubin >2 times ULN (total bilirubin >4 times ULN 
in case of documented Gilbert’s syndrome). 
 Use of systemic rescue medication. Patients should be withdrawn from treatment, but not 
necessarily from the study (see Section 6.5.2 ). 
Etokimab for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis Version 2.0 
Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  31  Termination of the study by the Investigator or Sponsor. 
 Pregnancy (see Appendix C  and Section 8.2.5 ). 
 Noncompli
ance with study treatment ( Section 6.4 ) 
Any subject
 who have received at least 1 dose of the study drug, should complete the ETV assessments 
and return for the safety follow-up assessments. 
If a subject withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain and continue 
to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
If a subject withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, 
and the Investigator must document this in the study center study records. 
In subjects who are discontinued for pregnancy, after completing ETV assessments and safety follow-up, 
they should be followed up until outcome of the pregnancy is known (see Section 8.2.5  and Appendix C ). 
See SOA ( Sec
tion 1.3 ) for data to be collected at the time of study discontinuat ion and follow-up and for 
any further evaluations that need to be completed. 
Subjects may be replaced in certain circumstances (eg, limited exposure to study drug). The final decision 
for replacement of subjects will be done on a case by case basis in consultation with Medical Monitor at 
the Sponsor’s designated contract research organization and/or with the Sponsor’s Medical Director. 
7.3 LOST TO FOLLOW-UP 
A subject will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable 
to be contacted by the study site staff.  
The following actions must be taken if a subject fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: 
 The study center personnel must attempt to contact the subject and reschedule the missed visit as 
soon as possible and counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or should continue in the study. If 
the re-scheduled visit falls within the next visit’s window, then the visit should be considered a 
missed visit and the subject should come in for the next scheduled visit as planned. Missed visits 
must be captured in the eCRFs and will be recorded as a protocol deviation. 
 Before a subject is deemed lost to follow-up, the Investigator or designee will make every effort 
to regain contact with the subject (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified 
letter to the subject’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact 
attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical record or study file.  
 Should the subject continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have withdrawn 
from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up.

Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  32  Assessments scheduled on the day of study treatment administration must be performed prior to 
the study treatment injection unless otherwise noted (see  Section 1.3 ). 
 There are vi
sits where the protocol requires more than 1 procedure to be completed at the same 
time point. When indicated, the procedure must follow specific order of events, see Section 1.3 
for instruc
tions. 
 Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor/designee immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the subject should continue or discontinue in the study. 
 Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in Section 1.3 , is essential 
and require d
 for study conduct. 
 All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential subjects meet 
all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all 
subjects screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable 
and the log will be sent weekly to clinical lead. 
 The maximum amount of blood collected from each subject over the duration of the study, 
including any extra assessments that may be required, is approximately 126 mL. Repeat or 
unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples. 
8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
Severity of AD from Baseline through EOS follow-up will be assessed by the Investigator and/or the 
subject using the EASI, vIGA-AD, SCORAD, DLQI, POEM, and NRS for Pruritus. In addition, the 
ACQ-6 will be obtained in subjects with a history of asthma at Baseline. 
It is recommended that the same Investigator/Sub-investigator completes the scales and questionnaires for 
all time points for a given subject. Patient reported outcome assessments (ie, SCORAD, DLQI, POEM, 
and ACQ-6) should be obtained prior to any other assessments at each visit as per Section 1.3 , except for 
signing of t h
e ICF. 
8.1.1  ECZEMA AREA AND SEVERITY INDEX (EASI) 
The EASI is an Investigator assessment measuring the severity of clinical signs in AD. The EASI is 
considered one of the best validated outcome measures for AD. The EASI score assesses the severity and 
extent of erythema; induration, papulation, and edema; excoriations; and lichenification. The  EASI 
scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating greater severity and extent of AD7, 8. The EASI 
score will b
e recorded at the time points indicated in the SOA (see Section 1.3 ). The EASI will be 
captured in 
electronic clinical outcome assessment (eCOA) tablet. The EASI instructions and forms are in 
Appendix F. 
8.1.2  VALIDATED INVESTIGATOR GLOBAL ASSESSMENT SCALE FOR ATOPIC 
DERMATITIS (VIGA-AD™) 
The vIGA-AD is a static 5-point scale to evaluate AD disease severity globally and is frequently assessed 
in clinical studies. Investigator’s vIGA-AD responses will be captured in eCOA tablet. The vIGA-AD 
result will be recorded at the time points indicated in the Section 1.3 . The vIGA-AD scale to be used is in 
Appendix G .

Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  33 8.1.3  SEVERITY SCORING OF ATOPIC DERMATITIS (SCORAD) 
The SCORAD index, a validated assessment of AD, was developed to standardize the evaluation of the 
extent and severity of AD. There are 3 components to the assessment: A = extent or affected BSA, B = 
severity, and C = subjective symptoms. The extent of AD is assessed as a percentage of each defined 
body area and reported as the sum of all areas (assigned as “A” in the overall SCORAD calculation). The 
severity of 6 specific symptoms of AD (redness, swelling, oozing/crusting, excoriation, skin 
thickening/lichenification, and dryness) is assessed using the following scale: none (0), mild (1), moderate 
(2), or severe (3) (for a maximum of 18 total points, assigned as “B” in the overall SCORAD calculation). 
Subjective assessment of itch and sleeplessness is recorded for each symptom by the subject on a visual 
analog scale, where 0 is no itch (or sleeplessness) and 10 is the worst imaginable itch (or sleeplessness), 
with a maximum possible score of 20. This parameter is assigned as “C” in the overall SCORAD 
calculation. 
The SCORAD score is calculated as: A/5 + 7B/2 + C (see  Appendix H  for more information). Subjects 
will unde r
go this assessment at time points specified in Section 1.3 . The SCORAD will be captured in 
eCOA tablet
. 
8.1.4  DERMATOLOGY LIFE QUALITY INDEX (DLQI) 
The DLQI is a 10-item, validated questionnaire used in clinical trials to assess the impact of AD disease 
symptoms and treatment on quality of life. The format is a simple response (0 to 3 where 0 is “not at all” 
and 3 is “very much”) to 10 questions, which assess quality of life (QoL) over the past week, with an 
overall scoring system of 0 to 30; a high score is indicative of a poor QoL .11 The questionnaire will be 
administe
red only to the subset of subjects who can read and understand a language in which 
questionnaire is presented (based on availability of validated translations in participating countries). The 
subject should complete the DLQI in Appendix I at the time points indicated in the SOA (see 
Section 1. 3)
. The DLQI will be captured in eCOA tablet. 
8.1.5  PATIENT ORIENTED ECZEMA MEASURE (POEM) 
The POEM is a 7-item, validated questionnaire used in clinical trials to assess the severity of eczema as 
experienced by the subject. The format is a response to 7 items (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep 
loss, bleeding, and weeping) based on frequency during the past week (ie, 0 = no days, 1 = 1 to 2 days, 
2 = 3 to 4 days, 3 = 5 to 6 days, and 4 = all days) with a scoring system of 0 to 28; the total score reflects 
disease-related morbidity12. The questionnaire will be administered only to the subset of subjects who can 
read and u
nderstand a language in which questionnaire is presented (based on availability of validated 
translations in participating countries). The subject should complete the POEM at the time points 
indicated in the SOA (see  Section 1.3 ). The POEM will be captured in eCOA tablet. The subject shoul d 
complete the POEM questionnaire (see Appendix J ).  
8.1.6  NUMERICAL RATING SCALE FOR PRURITUS 
The NRS for Pruritus is a simple assessment tool that subjects will use to report the intensity of their 
pruritus (itch) during a daily recall period using an ePRO device. Subjects will be asked 2 questions:  
Etokimab for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis Version 2.0 
Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  34  For average itch intensity: “On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being ‘no itch’ and 10 being the ‘worst 
imaginable itch’, how would you rate your itch overall (on average) during the previous 
24 hours?” 
 For maximum itch intensity: “On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being ‘no itch’ and 10 being the ‘worst 
imaginable itch’, how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 
24 hours?” 
The subject should complete the NRS for each of the 2 questions at the time points indicated in the SOA 
(see Section 1.3 ). Subjects will be instructed on using ePRO device to rec o rd their NRS score. Subjects 
will complete the rating scale daily through the last study visit. Study center will receive alerts when 
subjects do not complete the NRS items. Study center will be expected to contact subjects who have 
missed two consecutive entries to encourage compliance. The NRS for Pruritus will be captured on ePRO 
handheld device. 
8.1.7  ASTHMA CONTROL QUESTIONNAIRE-6 
The ACQ-6 will be used in this study to assess the asthma symptoms (night time waking, symptom on 
waking, activity limitation, and shortness of breath, wheezing, and short acting β agonist [SABA] usage) 
in subjects with active asthma disease. Subject will be asked to recall their experiences during the 
previous week by responding to 5 symptom related questions and 1 question related to bronchodilator 
use. Questions will be scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). The questionnaire 
will be administered only in subjects with active asthma disease whose primary language is English 
(based on availability of validated translations in participating countries). The subject should complete the 
ACQ-6 (see Appendix K ) at the time points indicated in the SOA (see Section 1.3 ). Th e ACQ-6 responses 
will be
 captured by subjects on paper and transcribed into the eCRF.  
8.1.8  BODY SURFACE AREA  
The BSA affected by AD will be assessed for each major section of the body including the head, trunk, 
upper extremities, and lower extremities and will be reported as the added total of percentage of all major 
body sections combined. The subject’s BSA will be assessed in Part A of SCORAD assessment. 
8.2 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SOA (see Section 1.3 ). 
Unsched
uled safety assessments may be performed at any time during the study.   
8.2.1  PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS

ight (in inches) will be measured only at the Screening visit.  
8.2.2  VITAL SIGNS 
Vital signs will be performed at the time points specified in the SOA (see Section 1.3) . 
 Body tempe
rature, HR, BP, respiratory rate, and weight will be assessed and entered in eCRF. 
 Weight will be measured at time points specified in Schedule of Activities (see Section 1.3 ).  
 NOTE: Body
 mass index will be calculated automatically using formula BMI=weight 
(kg)/(height[m2]) as specified in specified in the SOA (see  Section 1.3 ). 
 Blood p
res
sure and pulse rate measurements will be assessed in the seated position with a 
completely automated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not 
available. 
 Blood pressure and pulse rate measurements should be preceded by approximately 5 minutes of 
rest for the subject in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones etc.). 
8.2.3  12-LEAD ECG 
A single 12-lead ECG will be obtained at the time points specified in SOA (see  Section 1.3 ). 
 12-lead EC
G will be obtained using a validated ECG machine that automatically calculates the 
HR and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF intervals.  
 The ECG will be reviewed by the central laboratory team and the instructions and guidelines for 
collection (eg, equipment), transmission, and archiving of ECG data will be provided in the ECG 
Manual. 
 The ECG will be reviewed by the Investigator or an authorized representative who is experienced 
in the evaluation of ECGs and assessed for clinical significance. 
8.2.4  CLINICAL LABORATORY DATA 
Clinical safety laboratory assessments will be performed as below:  
 See Appendix B for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed an d the SOA (see 
Section 1.3 ) for the timing and frequency of the tests. 
 A central l
aboratory will be used to perform all laboratory tests, except urine pregnancy dipstick 
test, which will be assessed by the site staff. However, local laboratory tests will be allowed if the 
central laboratory results will not be available immediately because the Investigator will need to 
make an immediate decision for any safety concerns based on laboratory results.  
 The Investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review with date of review and 
their initials/signature, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in 
Etokimab for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis Version 2.0 
Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  36 the AE section of the eCRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those that are not associated with the 
underlying disease, unless judged by the Investigator to be more severe than expected for the 
subject’s condition. 
 All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation 
in the study including the subject’s last EOS visit should be repeated until the values return to 
normal or Baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant or judged medically 
stabilized by the Investigator or Medical Monitor. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
results should be reported as an AE or SAE if applicable. 
 If such values do not return to normal/Baseline within a period judged reasonable by the 
Investigator, the etiology should be identified, and the Sponsor must be notified. 
 All protocol-required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix B, must be conducted in 
accorda n
ce with the Laboratory Manual and the SOA (see  Section 1.3 ). 
o If labora
tory values from non-protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in subject management or are considered 
clinically significant by the Investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the 
results must be recorded in the eCRF and the laboratory reports must be filed with the source 
documents. 
8.2.5  PREGNANCY TESTING 
All WOCBP will have a serum pregnancy test (SPT) at screening and urine pregnancy test (UPT) at all 
designated post-screening timepoints as indicated in the SOA ( Section 1.3 ). If UPT is positive, a serum 
pregnanc
y test will be performed to confirm. If any result is positive prior to investigational product 
administration, the subject will not receive study drug and will be discontinued. Follicle stimulating 
hormone (FSH) may be used to confirm menopausal status in female subjects as needed. Refer to 
Appendix C  for further information. 
8.3 PHARMACOKINETICS 
Whole blood samples of approximately 5 mL will be collected for measurement of serum concentrations 
of etokimab at time points as specified in the SOA (see Section 1.3 ). A maximum of 2 samples may be 
collecte
d at additional time points during the study if warranted and agreed upon between the Investigator 
and Sponsor. Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided by the 
Sponsor. The actual date and time (24-hour clock time) of each sample will be recorded in the eCRF. 
Samples will be used to evaluate the PK of etokimab. Each serum sample will be divided into 2 aliquots 
(1 each for PK and a back-up). Samples collected for analyses of etokimab serum concentration may also 
be used to correlate exposure to safety or efficacy aspects related to concerns arising during or after the 
study. 
Measurement of concentrations of etokimab will be performed using a validated assay method. Only 
samples which are within the window of sample stability will be analyzed. Placebo samples will not be 
analyzed. The time points for PK sample collection are given in Appendix L . 
Etokimab for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis Version 2.0 
Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  37 While PK and immunogenicity samples must be collected from subjects assigned to the placebo arm to 
maintain the blinding of treatment assignment, PK and immunogenicity assay results for these subjects 
are not needed for the safe conduct or proper interpretation of this trial and the samples will therefore not 
be analyzed. Personnel responsible for performing PK assays will be unblinded to subjects’ treatment 
assignments in order to identify appropriate PK and immunogenicity samples to be analyzed. Samples 
from subjects assigned to the placebo arm may be analyzed upon request (ie, to evaluate a possible error 
in dosing). 
Genetic analyses will not be performed on these samples unless consent for this was included in the ICF. 
Subject confidentiality will be maintained. Drug concentration information that may unblind the study 
will not be reported to study centers or blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded. Any changes 
in the timing or addition of time points for any planned study assessments must be documented and 
approved by the relevant study team member and then archived in the Sponsor and study center study 
files but will not constitute a protocol amendment. The Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent 
Ethics Committee (IEC) will be informed of any safety issues that require alteration of the safety 
monitoring scheme or amendment of the ICF. If a subject refuses blood collection for PK analysis, this 
will not be considered a protocol deviation as the PK analysis is an exploratory objective. 
8.4 BIOMARKERS 
Biomarkers are not evaluated in this study. 
8.5 IMMUNOGENICITY 
Antibodies to etokimab will be evaluated in serum samples collected from all subjects according to the 
SOA (See Section 1.3 ). Additionally, serum samples should also be collected  at the final visit from 
subjects who discontinued study treatment or were withdrawn from the study. These samples will be 
tested by the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee. Each serum sample will be divided into 2 aliquots (1 each 
for immunogenicity testing and a back-up). 
Serum samples will be screened for antibodies binding to etokimab and the titer of confirmed positive 
samples will be reported. Other analyses may be performed to verify the stability of antibodies to study 
treatment and/or to further characterize the immunogenicity of study treatment.  
The detection and characterization of antibodies to etokimab will be performed using a validated assay 
method by or under the supervision of the Sponsor. Only samples which are within the window of sample 
stability will be analyzed. The time points for ADA sample collection is given in Appendix L .  
Samp
les that are confirmed positive for antibodies binding to etokimab with a titer greater than one may 
be further characterized and/or evaluated for their ability to neutralize the activity of the study treatment 
using a validated assay method.

AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  39 8.6.5  REGULATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SAES 
Regulatory reporting requirements for SAE are as below: 
 Prompt notification by the Investigator to the IQVIA Lifecycle Safety team of an SAE is essential 
so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects and the safety 
of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met.  
 The IQVIA Lifecycle Safety team has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory 
authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical 
investigation. 
 The IQVIA Lifecycle Safety team will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional review board/Independent 
Ethics Committee, and Investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reactions according to local regulatory requirements and IQVIA 
Lifecycle Safety policy and forwarded to Investigators as necessary. 
 An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the IQVIA Lifecycle Safety team will 
review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to 
local requirements. 
Upon checking serious on the AE eCRF, a notification will be sent to the Medical Monitor and/or designee. 
Relevant eCRFs, including the subject’s Medical History, Concomitant Medications, and other AEs must 
also be completed to provide supporting documentation for the SAE. If there are additional documents that 
support the SAE (eg, clinic or hospital records or procedure reports), they should be uploaded to the AE 
eCRF. 
After review of the initial SAE report, the Medical Monitor may request additional documentation. The 
Sponsor is responsible for notifying the relevant Regulatory Authorities of certain events. It is the 
Investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB/IEC of all SAEs that occur at his or her site. Investigators 
will also be notified of all unexpected, serious, study drug-related events that occur during any other clinical 
trial of etokimab. The Investigator is responsible for notifying its IRB/IEC of these additional SAEs. 
8.6.6  PREGNANCY 
 Details will be collected on all pregnancies occurring from after the start of study treatment and 
until at least 16 weeks after the last dose. 
 Details of all pregnancies in female partners of male subjects will be collected while the male 
subject is in this study and until at least 16 weeks after the last dose. 
 If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator should inform IQVIA Lifecycle Safety within 24 
hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix C . 
 If a
 pregnancy occurs, it will be followed-up to determine the outcome, but no longer than 4 
weeks after the estimated delivery date. 
 Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, and ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.

For subject overdose (ie, dosing errors resulting in the administration of an SC dose that is more 
than 2 times the assigned dose), the Investigator or designee should: 
1. Monitor the subject clinically:  
 Supportive measures are to be undertaken as clinically indicated. 
 Electrocardiography and clinical laboratory evaluations (ie, blood glucose, hepatic 
enzymes, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, creatine kinase, and complete blood count) are

8.7 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS 
 
8.7.1  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
According to ICH and Industry requirements this protocol considers unanticipated problems (UPs) 
involving risks to participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that 
meets all  of the following criteria: 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being 
studied; 
 
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the 
procedures involved in the research); and 
 
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.

written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and the FDA within 
14 days of the IRB’s/IEC’s receipt of the report of the problem from the Investigator. 
 
8.7.3  REPORTING UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS TO PARTICIPANTS  
The Sponsor will disclose clinical trial data to individuals, to investigators at sites, and publicly as 
aggregate summaries, in accordance with applicable regulations and requirements. 
 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
All data listings, summaries, and analyses will be performed under the guidance and approval of the 
Sponsor.  
Descriptive statistics will be used for all variables, as appropriate. Continuous variables will be 
summarized by the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. 
Categorical variables will be summarized by frequency counts and percentages for each category. Unless 
otherwise stated, percentages will be calculated out of the total population for each treatment arm.  
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be developed and finalized before database lock and will provide 
details about describe the subject analysis data sets to be included in the analyses of the primary, 
secondary and exploratory endpoints, and missing data strategies/procedures for accounting for missing, 
unused, and spurious data, testing strategies, among other details.  
Etokimab for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis Version 2.0 
Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  42 PK analyses will be detailed in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan. This section is a summary of the 
planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints. Ad hoc exploratory analysis may be 
performed in addition to those specified, but no claims or conclusions will be drawn other than 
hypotheses to be tested in future clinical trials.  
The statistical analysis will be performed using statistical analysis system (SAS®) Version 9.4 or higher 
if available. All details regarding the statistical analysis and the preparation of tables, listings and figures 
will be described in the SAP. 
The default summary statistics for continuous variables includes number of contributing observations (n), 
mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum or as described in the respective 
section.  
For categorical variables, the number and percentage (the percentage of subjects in each category relative 
to the total number of subjects in the relevant analysis set or relative to the total number of subjects in the 
relevant analysis set, with assessments available [where appropriate]) in each category will be the default 
summary presentation.  
9.1 SAMPLE SIZE 
The expected efficacy response (and variability) for active and placebo response (related with percent 
change from Baseline in EASI score to Week 16) was estimated after review of 5 previous studies in 
subjects with moderate-to-severe AD subjects not taking topical corticosteroids.  
In this way, a total sample of approximately 300 subjects (60 subjects per treatment arm) achieves more 
than 95% power to detect differences among the means versus the alternative of equal means using an 
F test with a 0.05000 significance level. The size of the variation in the means is represented by their 
standard deviation which is 18.59. The common standard deviation within a group is assumed to be 
50.00. 
The hypothesized means used to compute the sample size derived from the studies mentioned before are: 
-20 -44. -65.4 -66.4 -68 (for placebo and each active treatment arm respectively) with a covariate 
R-squared of 0.300. 
9.2 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESIS 
Statistical hypotheses and testing utilized will be defined in the SAP, including the null and alternative 
hypotheses. Primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoint analyses will all be included in the SAP.

Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  43 9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES 
For purposes of analysis, the analysis sets are defined in Table 6 . 
Tabl
e 6. Analysis Sets 
Analysis Set Description 
Safety Analysis Set (SAF) The SAF will include all randomized subjects who receive at least 
1 dose of etokimab or placebo. The safety analysis set will be used for 
all safety analyses. Subjects will be analyzed as treated. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) The FAS will be based on the intent to treat principle and will include 
all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of etokimab or 
placebo and have Baseline and postbaseline EASI score. The full 
analysis set will be used for all efficacy analyses. Subjects will be 
analyzed as randomized. 
PP Analysis Set (PPS) The PPS will include all subjects in the FAS who do not have major 
protocol deviations (See Section 10.1.10 ).  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) 
Analysis Set The PK analysis set will include all etokimab treated-subjects in the 
safety analysis set who have at least one quantifiable postdose PK 
sample available and who do not have events or protocol deviations or 
events with the potential to affect PK concentrations. The PK analysis 
set will be used for all PK analyses. 
 
 
9.4 BASELINE DEFINITION 
Unless otherwise specified, Baseline is defined as the last observed value of the parameter of interest 
prior to the first intake of study drug (this includes unscheduled visits). For numerical variables, change 
from Baseline will be calculated as the difference between the value of interest and the corresponding 
baseline value. 
9.5 EFFICACY ANALYSES 
Descriptive statistics for absolute and change from Baseline by visit will be provided for all continuous 
primary, secondary, and exploratory efficacy endpoints. 
Categorical end points will be summarized using frequency and percentage. By-subject listings will also 
be provided. Primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints will be analyzed as described below. 
Etokimab for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis Version 2.0 
Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  44 9.5.1  PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT 
Percent change in EASI score from Baseline to Week 16 will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model 
adjusting for baseline EASI score in the FAS. 
The primary comparison will be least squares (LS) mean difference between active treatment group(s) 
and placebo at 16 weeks. Treatment differences will be presented with corresponding p  values and 95% 
confidence interval.  
9.5.2  SECONDARY AND EXPLORATORY ENDPOINTS 
All secondary binary endpoints will be analyzed using a logistic regression adjusting for baseline EASI 
score. 
For all continuous endpoints, an ANCOVA model (similar to the analysis for the primary endpoint) will 
be used. 
9.5.3  MULTIPLICITY 
For the primary endpoint, a hierarchical testing procedure will be used, from the highest dose to the 
lowest dose until statistical significance at the 5% level is not achieved.  
Note: comparisons between active treatment doses are not intended in this study. In case 2 or more dose 
level results are positive, then the Sponsor will decide the optimal dose based on the risk / benefit profile 
for each dose level. 
Testing of secondary Endpoints: 
A gatekeeping procedure around the primary endpoint will be used: if at least 1 of the comparisons 
between the active treatments vs placebo crosses the 0.05 alpha boundary (statistical significance) then all 
secondary endpoints will be tested in a hierarchical approach. The order / sequence for testing all 
secondary endpoints will be described in the SAP.  
9.5.4  HANDLING OF DROPOUTS AND MISSING DATA 
Every effort should be made to minimize dropouts and missing assessment data. Subjects should be 
reminded of the importance of providing assessments as per protocol, and study personnel should be 
vigilant in ensuring assessments are completed as scheduled. 
Nonetheless, as subjects may elect to be withdrawn from study treatments or evaluations without 
prejudice, it is inevitable that there will be missing data. 
For subjects who receive rescue therapy and are considered nonresponders according to  Section 6.5.2 , the 
dat
a collected after rescue treatment is initiated will be treated as missing. 
Missing efficacy data will be imputed using Multiple Imputation (MI) Procedure which will be detailed in 
the SAP. Additional missing data strategies will be used as deemed appropriate. 
Safety data will not be imputed.

Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  45 9.6 SAFETY ANALYSES 
For safety and tolerability, AEs, SAEs, vital signs, ECGs, ADA, neutralizing antibodies, and clinical 
laboratory assessments at specific time points will be evaluated. All safety data will be summarized 
descriptively. Number and percentage of AEs will be presented for each treatment group by preferred 
term and system organ class of the current Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Authorities (MedDRA).  
Individual listings of all SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation from the study drug will be 
summarized using the current MedDRA. Summaries and listings of data for vital signs, hematology, 
clinical chemistry and urinalysis laboratory tests, and ECGs will be presented. Appropriate descriptive 
statistics will be summarized for the observed value at each scheduled assessment and for the 
corresponding change from Baseline. The Baseline will be the last assessment obtained before the first 
dose. 
Additional safety analysis will be also provided as deemed appropriate. Details will be provided in the 
SAP. 
9.6.1  ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as: 
• A new event that occurs during or after first dose of study treatment or, 
• Any event present at Baseline that worsens in either intensity or frequency after first dose of 
study treatment. 
Only TEAEs will be summarized. 
Adverse events will be coded using MedDRA. Number of events and percentage will be tabulated by 
preferred term (PT) and system organ class (SOC). An event that occurred 1 or more times during a 
treatment period will contribute 1 observation to the numerator. The denominator will consist of all 
subjects in the SAF. If the intensity or seriousness of the AE changes, the overall intensity or seriousness 
will be the maximum intensity or seriousness of the multiple occurrences. The AEs, SAEs, TEAEs, 
TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation, TEAEs leading to withdrawal of subject, and TEAEs leading 
to death will be listed and summarized by SOC and PT. Summaries will also be presented by relatedness 
to the study drug and severity. 
Injection site reactions will be reported separately by treatment. 
9.6.2  DEATHS 
The following death summaries will be generated: 
• Number (%) of subjects who died by study period (TEAE, on-study) and reasons for death 
summarized for the SAF by treatment received.

hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis laboratory tests will be presented. Appropriate descriptive 
statistics will be summarized for the observed value at each scheduled assessment and for the 
corresponding change from Baseline. 
For hematology and biochemistry tests, listings of subject data will also flag up any abnormal or out-of-
range values. Clinically significant changes in the laboratory test parameters will be summarized and 
listed. Hematology and clinical laboratory data will be reported in System International units. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to present the safety outcomes including, physical examination results, 
weight, BMI, 12-lead ECG, vital signs measurements, and clinical laboratory test results. 
Change from Baseline will also be summarized for vital signs measurements, and clinical laboratory test 
results. 
All ECG data results (normal/abnormal) will be summarized using frequency and percentages. Clinically 
significant abnormalities will be presented in by-subject listings. 
9.6.4  SUBJECT DISPOSITION 
A summary of subject disposition will be provided using the SAF. It will include the number of subjects 
screened, randomized, treated, completed as well as the number of dropouts, with reasons for 
discontinuation, and major protocol deviations. 
A listing will be presented to describe date of screening, assigned treatment, screen failed with reason, 
completion or early withdrawal, and the reason for early discontinuation, if applicable, for each subject. A 
list of protocol deviations will be identified and approved by the Investigator and Sponsor during the dry 
run to categorize deviations as major or minor. 
9.6.5  SUBJECT CHARACTERISTICS AND MEDICAL HISTORY 
Subject characteristics obtained at screening will be summarized for all subjects taking etokimab. Subject 
characteristics may include, but are not limited to age, gender, ethnicity, race, height, weight, and BMI.

Subgroup analyses will be detailed in the SAP. 
9.9 IMMUNOGENICITY ANALYSES 
Observed values for ADA levels/status will be listed by subject and summarized with descriptive 
statistics based on the Safety Analysis Set. If data permits, correlation will be analyzed between 
ADA levels and safety and efficacy endpoints. 
9.10 OTHER ANALYSES 
Pharmacokinetic analyses will be described in a PK modeling and simulation analysis plan, separate from 
the SAP, and finalized before database lock. The population PK analysis will be presented separately 
from the main clinical study report in a PK modeling and simulation report.  
Serum etokimab concentrations will be listed and summarized for each sampling time point using 
appropriate descriptive statistics. Pharmacokinetic concentration data collected from the study may be 
included in a population PK based (meta-) analysis, using non-linear mixed effects modeling. The data 
from this study may be combined with data collected from other studies for population PK model 
development.  
The primary PK parameters of CL/F and Vd/F will be estimated by population PK modeling from 
etokimab serum concentrations after SC administrations. Secondary PK parameters (AUC , C max, and t max 
f
or the first dose, and AUC , Cmax, tmax, and t 1/2 for the last dose) will also be calculated for etokimab after 
S
C administrations, where possible, using a Bayesian post-hoc estimation approach based upon the 
aforementioned population PK model. The PK parameters will be listed and summarized using 
appropriate descriptive statistics. A covariate screen of subject specific factors (eg, demographic and 
clinical characteristics) will be included in the analyses.

any reason at the sole discretion of the Sponsor. Reasons may include safety, among others. Should the 
Sponsor decide to terminate the study, the Investigator(s) will be notified in writing. 
Study centers will be closed upon study completion. A study center is considered closed when all required 
documents and study supplies have been collected and a study center closure visit has been performed. 
The Investigator may initiate study center closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and 
sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. 
Reasons for the early closure of a study center by the Sponsor or Investigator may include but are not 
limited to: 
 Failure of the Investigator to comply with the protocol, with International Conference on 
Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GPC) guidelines, the requirements of the IRB/IEC or local 
health authorities, the Sponsor’s procedures, FDA guidelines and regulations, or GCP guidelines. 
 Inadequate recruitment of subjects by the Investigator. 
 Discontinuation of further study treatment development. 
10.1.3  CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY  
Subject confidentiality and privacy are strictly held in trust by the participating investigators, their staff, 
and the Sponsor(s) and their interventions. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological 
samples and genetic tests in addition to the clinical information relating to subjects. Therefore, the study 
protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. 
No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without 
prior written approval of the Sponsor.  
All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible. 
The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the Sponsor, representatives of the IRB/IEC, 
regulatory agencies or pharmaceutical company supplying study drug may inspect all documents and 
records required to be maintained by the Investigator, including but not limited to, medical records 
(office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for the subjects in this study. The clinical study center 
will permit access to such records. 
The study subject’s contact information will be securely stored at each clinical study center for internal 
use during the study. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for 
as long a period as dictated by the reviewing IRB/IEC, Institutional policies, or Sponsor requirements. 
Study subject research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific reporting, will be 
transmitted to and stored at the data management company responsible for data management, analysis, 
and reporting. This will not include the subject’s contact or identifying information. Rather, individual 
subjects and their research data will be identified by a unique study identification number. The study data

Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  50 entry and study management systems used by clinical study sites and by data management research staff 
will be secured and password protected. At the end of the study, all study databases will be de-identified 
and archived by the Sponsor. 
All information generated in this study must be considered highly confidential and must not be disclosed 
to any persons not directly concerned with the study without written prior permission from the Sponsor. 
Authorized regulatory officials and Sponsor personnel (or their representatives) will be allowed full 
access to inspect and copy the records. All study investigational product, subject bodily fluids, and/or 
other materials collected shall be used solely in accordance with this protocol, unless otherwise agreed to 
in writing by the Sponsor. Subjects will only be identified by unique subject numbers on eCRFs. 
Every subject will be given a copy of each version of the form that he/she signs before and during the 
study. Each ICF may also include authorization allowing the institution, Investigator, and Sponsor to use 
and disclose personal health information in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996 Health Information Portability and Accountability Act. 
10.1.4  FUTURE USE OF STORED SPECIMENS AND DATA  
Blood and serum specimen storage outside the study required assessments is optional and requires 
subjects to sign an ICF. Refusal to participate in this optional specimen storage does not affect a subject’s 
ability to be enrolled in the study. A subject may choose to participate in this specimen storage at 
screening or any time during the study up to and including the end of study visit.  
With the subject’s approval and as approved by local IRBs/IECs, de-identified biological samples will be 
stored at a certified, licensed central laboratory. These samples may be used to research the causes of AD, 
its complications and other conditions for which individuals with AD are at increased risk, and to improve 
treatment. The central lab will also be provided with a code-link that will allow linking the biological 
specimens with the phenotypic data from each subject, maintaining the blinding of the identity of the 
subject. 
During the conduct of the study, a subject may choose to withdraw consent to have biological specimens 
stored for future research.  
Samples will be stored at least until completion of study, which refers to signed CSR, with preference to 
store samples up to 5 years following EOS. If a subject withdraws from study prior to analysis, samples 
collected from the subject may be destroyed following written notification to Sponsor and Sponsor 
confirming approval to destroy in writing as well. Sponsor will also provide in writing any instructions if 
samples are to be destroyed sooner than the 5-year limit.

AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  53 Electronic data capture (EDC) will be used for this study, meaning that all eCRF data will be entered in 
electronic forms at the study center. Data collection will be completed by authorized study center staff 
designated by the Investigator. Appropriate training and security measures will be completed with the 
Investigator and all authorized study center staff prior to the study being initiated and any data being 
entered into the system for any study subjects. 
All data must be entered in English. The eCRFs should always reflect the latest observations on the 
subjects participating in the study. Therefore, the eCRFs are to be completed as soon as possible during or 
after the subject’s visit. To avoid inter observer variability, every effort should be made to ensure that the 
same individual who made the initial baseline determinations completes all efficacy and safety 
evaluations. The Investigator must verify that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and correct. If 
some assessments are not done, or if certain information is not available or not applicable or unknown, 
the Investigator should indicate this in the eCRF. The Investigator will be required to electronically sign 
off on the clinical data. 
The Clinical Site Monitor will review the eCRFs and evaluate them for completeness and consistency. 
The eCRF will be compared with the source documents to ensure that there are no discrepancies between 
critical data. All entries, corrections and alterations are to be made by the responsible Investigator or 
his/her designee. The Monitor cannot enter data in the eCRFs. Once clinical data of the eCRF have been 
submitted to the central server, corrections to the data fields will be audit trailed, meaning that the reason 
for change, the name of the person who performed the change, together with time and date will be logged. 
Roles and rights of the center staff responsible for entering the clinical data into the eCRF will be 
determined in advance. If additional corrections are needed, the responsible Monitor or Data Manager 
will raise a query in the EDC application. The appropriate study center staff will answer queries sent to 
the Investigator. This will be audit trailed by the EDC application meaning that the name of 
investigational staff, time and date stamp are captured. 
The eCRF is essentially considered a data entry form and should not constitute the original (or source) 
medical records unless otherwise specified. Source documents are all documents used by the Investigator 
or hospital that relate to the subject’s medical history, that verify the existence of the subject, the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria and all records covering the subject’s participation in the study. They 
include but are not limited to laboratory notes, ECG results, memoranda, pharmacy dispensing records, 
subject files, etc. Source data should be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and 
complete. Changes to source data should be traceable, should not obscure the original entry, and should 
be explained if necessary (eg, via an audit trail). 
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining source documents. These will be made available for 
inspection by the study Monitor at each monitoring visit. The Investigator must submit a completed eCRF 
for each subject who receives study treatment, regardless of duration. All supportive documentation 
submitted with the eCRF, such as laboratory or hospital records, should be clearly identified with the 
study and subject number. Any personal information, including subject name, should be removed or 
rendered illegible to preserve individual confidentiality. 
Electronic case report form records will be automatically appended with the identification of the creator, 
by means of their unique User ID. Specified records will be electronically signed by the Investigator to 
document his/her review of the data and acknowledgement that the data are accurate. This will be 
Etokimab for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis Version 2.0 
Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  54 facilitated by means of the Investigator’s unique User ID and password; date and time stamps will be 
added automatically at time of electronic signature. If an entry on an eCRF requires change, the correction 
should be made in accordance with the relevant software procedures. All changes will be fully recorded in 
a protected audit trail, and a reason for the change will be required. 
10.1.9.2  STUDY RECORDS RETENTION  
The Investigator must maintain essential study documents (protocol and protocol amendments, completed 
eCRFs, signed ICFs, relevant correspondence, and all other supporting documentation). The study center 
should plan on retaining such documents for approximately 15 years after study completion. The study 
center should retain such documents until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application 
in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region 
or at least 2 years after the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the study treatment 
(etokimab). These documents should be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable 
regulatory requirements or the hospital, institution, or private practice in which the study is being 
conducted. Subject identification codes (subject names and corresponding study numbers) will be retained 
for this same period of time. These documents may be transferred to another responsible party, acceptable 
to Sponsor, who agrees to abide by the retention policies. Written notification of transfer must be 
submitted to Sponsor. No study records should be destroyed without prior authorization from the 
Sponsor. 
10.1.10  PR OTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, ICH GCP, or Clinical 
Operations Plan requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the subject, the 
Investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the 
site and implemented promptly.  
It is the responsibility of the study center Investigator to use continuous vigilance to identify and report 
deviations as soon as possible. All deviations must be addressed in study source documents and must be 
sent to the reviewing IRB per their policies. The site Investigator is responsible for knowing and adhering 
to the reviewing IRB requirements.  
Major protocol deviations considered to affect the primary analysis include, but are not limited to, the 
following:  
 Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria as defined by protocol 
 Mishandling of the study drug which could have impacted the integrity of the study data such as 
non-allowable temperature deviations during storage or dispensing of study drug to the wrong 
subject 
 Partial dosing of study treatment 
 Use of prohibited concomitant medications unless defined as rescue medication per protocol 
 Study procedures done outside protocol-specified window period that are judged to affect study 
efficacy data 
 Assessments for primary endpoint not done. 
Etokimab for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis Version 2.0 
Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  55 Protocol deviations will be reviewed prior to unblinding and individual subjects having protocol 
deviations will be evaluated for inclusion in the PPS. Any additional deviations not listed above will be 
documented at this time. Further details about the handling of protocol deviations will be included in the 
Protocol Deviation Plan, Clinical Operations Plan, Medical Monitoring Plan, Safety Management Plan, 
and SAP.  
This study will be conducted as described in this protocol, except for an emergency situation in which the 
protection, safety, and well-being of the subject requires immediate intervention, based on the judgment 
of the Investigator (or a responsible, appropriately trained professional designated by the Investigator). In 
the event of a significant deviation from the protocol due to an emergency, accident, or mistake, the 
Investigator or designee must contact the Medical Monitor and the Sponsor at the earliest possible time by 
telephone. This will allow an early joint decision regarding the subject’s continuation in the study. This 
decision will be documented by the Investigator and the Medical Monitor. 
10.1.11  PU BLICATION AND DATA SHARING POLICY  
The data generated by this study are confidential information of the Sponsor. The Sponsor will make the 
results of the study publicly available. The publication policy with respect to the Investigator and study 
center will be set forth in the Clinical Trial Agreement. 
10.1.12  CO NFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY 
The independence of this study from any actual or perceived influence is critical. Therefore, any actual 
conflict of interest of persons who have a role in the design, conduct, analysis, publication, financial 
interest, or any aspect of this trial will be disclosed and managed. Furthermore, persons who have a 
perceived conflict of interest will be required to have such conflicts managed in a way that is appropriate 
to their participation in the design and conduct of this trial. The study leadership has established policies 
and procedures for all study group members to disclose all conflicts of interest and will establish a 
mechanism for the management of all reported dualities of interest. Investigators and Sub-investigators 
will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial information as requested to allow the Sponsor 
to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate 
regulatory authorities. Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests in 
accordance to local requirements and laws during the course of the study and for 1 year after completion 
of the study.

(p. 15)  In addition, tuberculosis 
testing by interferon-
gamma (IFN-γ) release 
assay (IGRA) will be 
performed on a country-by-

regulatory authorities (eg,

latent forms of TBC if

4.3 Justification for Dose 
(p. 26) Emergent data from the 
Phase I study (ANB020-001) 
and Phase IIa study 
(ANB020-002) are the basis 
for the section of dose of 
ANB020 for the current 
study. The 300 mg IV dose 
was found to be safe and well 
tolerated in healthy subjects 
and in subjects with AD. An 
interim analysis of the 
Phase IIa study indicated that 
a clinical response was 
observed 2 weeks post 
ANB020 administration 
(300 mg IV). One month 
post ANB020 
administration, the average 
EASI score reduction was 
61% and the average pruritus 
reduction was 32 % relative 
to Baseline. Sustained 
clinical response was 
observed after 2 months 
post-ANB020 
administration.  
 
The Phase I study in healthy 
subjects is completed. The 
dose range of ANB020 
(excluding the expected sub-
therapeutic 20 mg, and 
placebo arms) selected for 
this study has provided 
complete inhibition of IL-33 
induced cytokine release, 
and has been used safely in 
study ANB020-001. Data from the Phase I study 
(ANB020-001) and 
Phase IIa study (ANB020-
002) are the basis for the 
selection of dose of 
ANB020 for the current 
study. The dose range of 
ANB020 selected for this 
study has been used safely 
in study ANB020 001. 
ANB020 pharmacodynamic 
activity, measured as 
inhibition of ex-vivo IL-33 
stimulated INF-γ 
production, can be inferred 
from the correlation with 
PK data. All of the selected 
dose levels of ANB020 are 
predicted to induce full IL-
33 inhibition within 2 days 
for at least 9-10 days after 
dosing. The administration 
of the loading doses of 
ANB020 will allow 
systemic concentrations to 
reach serum concentrations 
sustaining more than 95% 
IL-33 inhibition faster, and 
potentially reduce the time 
to onset of clinical effect. 
Data from the Phase IIa 
study show a clinical 
response 1 week post 
ANB020 administration 
(300 mg IV), and the dose 
was found to be safe and 
well tolerated. One month 
post ANB020 
administration, the average 
EASI score reduction was 
61% and the average 
pruritus reduction was 32 % 
relative to Baseline. 
Sustained clinical response 
was observed after 
2 months post-ANB020 
administration.  Provided additional 
clarification on rationale for 
dose.

(p. 26) Emergent data from the 
Phase I study (ANB020-

(ANB020-002) are the basis 
for the section of dose of 
ANB020 for the current 
study. The 300  mg IV dose Data from the Phase I study 
(ANB020-001) and 
Phase IIa study (ANB020-

was found to be safe and 
well tolerated in healthy 
subjects and in subjects with 
AD. An interim analysis of 
the Phase IIa study indicated 
that a clinical response was 
observed 2 weeks post 
ANB020 administration 
(300 mg IV). One month 
post ANB020 
administration, the average 
EASI score reduction was 
61% and the average 
pruritus reduction was 32 % 
relative to Baseline. 
Sustained clinical response 
was observed after 2 months 
post-ANB020 
administration.  
 
The Phase I study in healthy 
subjects is completed. The 
dose range of ANB020 
(excluding the expected sub-
therapeutic 20 mg, and 
placebo arms) selected for 
this study has provided 
complete inhibition of IL-33 
induced cytokine release, 
and has been used safely in 
study ANB020-001. ANB020 selected for this 
study has been used safely 
in study ANB020-001. 
ANB020 pharmacodynamic 
activity, measured as 
inhibition of ex-vivo IL-33 
stimulated INF-γ 
production, can be inferred 
from the correlation with 
PK data. All of the selected 
dose levels of ANB020 are 
predicted to induce full IL-
33 inhibition within 2 days 
for at least 9-10 days after 
dosing. The administration 
of the loading doses of 
ANB020 will allow 
systemic concentrations to 
reach serum concentrations 
sustaining more than 95% 
IL-33 inhibition faster, and 
potentially reduce the time 
to onset of clinical effect. 
Data from the Phase IIa 
study show a clinical 
response 1 week post 
ANB020 administration 
(300 mg IV), and the dose 
was found to be safe and 
well tolerated. One month 
post ANB020 
administration, the average 
EASI score reduction was 
61% and the average 
pruritus reduction was 32 %

2 months post-ANB020 
administration.  
6.5.6 Rescue Medicine  
(pg. 37) Subjects who are rescued 
should receive low potency 
TCS over moderate or high

rescue therapy should be 
administered to lesional 
skin only. The choice of the 
corticosteroid should be 
based upon standard of care 
considerations (eg, body 
area involved, severity of 
skin inflammation). A list 
of representative topical 
corticosteroids is provided 
in Appendix 15. We 
suggest a low potency 
corticosteroids (Class 6/7) 
cream or ointment. If 
needed for more severe 
inflammation, we suggest 
moderate potency 
corticosteroids (Class 4/5).

AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  70 APPENDIX C: CONTRACEPTIVE GUIDANCE AND COLLECTION OF 
PREGNANCY INFORMATION 
 
Definitions:  
 
Wo
man of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP) 
 
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile 
(see below). 
 
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP: 
 
1. Premenarchal 
2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: 
a) Documented hysterectomy. 
b) Documented bilateral salpingectomy. 
c) Documented bilateral oophorectomy. 
Note: Documentation can come from the study center personnel’s: review of the subject’s medical records, 
medical examination, or medical history interview. 
 
3. Postmenopausal female: 
a) A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high 
follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). 
However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
b) Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 1 of the non-estrogen 
hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. 
Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study 
enrollment. 
Contraception Guidance 
 
Male Subjects 
• Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to ONE of 
the following (during the protocol-defined time frame in  Section 5.1 ):  
o Are
 abstinent from penile vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifestyle (abstinent on a long term 
and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent. 
 
o Agree to use a male condom plus partner use of a contraceptive method with a failure rate of < 1% per year 
when having penile vaginal intercourse with a WOCBP who is not currently pregnant. 
o In addition, male subjects must refrain from donating sperm for the duration of the study and for 3 months 
after the last dose of study treatment. 
 
• Male subjects with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain abstinent from penile vaginal 
intercourse or use a male condom during each episode of penile penetration for the duration of the study and for 
3 months after the last dose of study treatment. 
Female Subjects 
Etokimab for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis Version 2.0 
Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  71 • Female subjects must refrain from donating ova for the duration of the study and for 3 months after the last dose 
of study treatment. 
 Female subjects of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use highly effective 
methods of contraception consistently and correctly as described in the table below and refrain from 
donating oocytes (eggs) for 3 months after receiving the last dose of study treatment. 
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods 
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent a  
Fa
ilure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  
Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
 Oral.  
 Intravaginal. 
 Transdermal. 
Progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
 Oral. 
 Injectable.  
Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent a  
Implantable progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
 Intrauterine device. 
 Intrauterine hormone-releasing system. 
Hormone-free intrauterine device interfering with sperm transport and fertilization. 
Bilateral tubal occlusion or ligation. 
Vasectomized partner  
A vasectomy is a highly effective birth control method provided that the vasectomized partner is the sole male 
sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm post vasectomy has been confirmed. If not, an additional 
highly effective method of contraception should be used.  
Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence 
needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.  
NOTES :  
a Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent 
wit
h local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for subjects participating in clinical studies. 
 
Pregnancy Testing 
• W
omen of child bearing potential should only be included after a confirmed menstrual period and a negative 
highly sensitive serum pregnancy test at screening and urine pregnancy test on Day 1 (prior to study treatment 
administration). 
• Additional pregnancy testing should be performed as mentioned in the Schedule of Activities (see  Section 1.3 ). 
• Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever a menstrual cycle is missed or when pregnancy is otherwise 
suspected. Positive urine pregnancy test result should be confirmed with a serum test.

AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  72 • The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male subject’s female partner who 
becomes pregnant while the male subject is in this study. This applies only to male subjects who receive study 
treatment. 
• The Investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate pregnancy form and submit it to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The female partner will also be followed to 
determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to 
the Sponsor. Generally, the follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. 
Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) 
or indication for the procedure. 
Female Subjects who Become Pregnant  
• The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female subject who becomes pregnant while 
participating in this study. Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to the Sponsor 
within 24 hours of learning of a subject’s pregnancy. The subject will be followed to determine the outcome of 
the pregnancy. The Investigator will collect follow-up information on the subject and the neonate and the 
information will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow-up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 
weeks after the delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence 
or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or elective 
termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion is always considered to 
be an SAE and will be reported as such. 
• Any post study pregnancy related SAE considered reasonably related to the study treatment by the Investigator 
will be reported to the Sponsor as described in  Section 8.6.5 . While the Investigator is not obligated to actively  
s
eek this information in former subjects, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting. 
• Any female subject who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will be withdrawn from the study.

AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  81 Area: 
To determine extent, the sites affected by eczema are shaded on a drawing of a body. The affected area (A) 
is calculated as a percentage of the whole body.  
 Head 8% 
 Upper limbs 9% each 
 Lower limbs 18% each 
 Hands 2% each 
 Anterior trunk and neck 18% 
 Back and neck 18%  
 1% for genitals. 
The score for each area is added up. The total area is 'A', which has a possible maximum of 103%.  
Intensity: 
A representative area of eczema is selected. In this area, the intensity of each of the following signs is 
assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) or severe (3). 
 Redness 
 Swelling 
 Oozing/crusting 
 Scratch marks  
 Skin thickening (lichenification) 
 Dryness (this is assessed in an area where there is no inflammation) 
The intensity scores are added together to give 'B' (maximum 18). 
Subjective symptoms: 
Subjective symptoms ie, itch and sleeplessness, are each scored by the subject or relative using a visual 
analogue scale where 0 is no itch (or no sleeplessness) and 10 is the worst imaginable itch (or sleeplessness). 
These scores are added to give 'C' (maximum 20). 
Total score: 
The SCORAD for that individual is A/5 + 7B/2 + C

Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  91 APPENDIX M: ADVERSE EVENTS: DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR 
RECORDING, EVALUATING, FOLLOW-UP, AND REPORTING 
 
AE Definition 
 An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or subject, temporally associated 
with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. 
 NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the 
use of study treatment. 
 
Events Meeting the AE Definition  
 Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, biochemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety 
assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, and vital signs measurements), including those that 
worsen from Baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment 
of the Investigator (ie, not related to progression of underlying disease). 
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study. 
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction. 
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or 
a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an 
intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should 
be reported regardless of sequelae. 
 "Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be reported 
as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the 
signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as 
AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE.  
 
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition  
 Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments 
which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the Investigator to be 
more severe than expected for the subject’s condition. 
 The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s condition. 
 Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the 
procedure is the AE. 
 Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience 
admission to a hospital). 
 Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
 
Etokimab for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis Version 2.0 
Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  92 Definition of SAE 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: 
a) Results in death 
b) Is life-threatening 
The term ‘life-threatening’ in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject 
was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically 
might have caused death, if it were more severe. 
c) Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at least 
an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would 
not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur 
during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other 
serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or 
was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. 
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from 
Baseline is not considered an AE. 
d) Results in persistent disability/incapacity 
 The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions. 
 This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance 
such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not 
constitute a substantial disruption. 
e) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Etokimab for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis Version 2.0 
Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  93 f) Other situations: 
 Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed in the above 
definition. These events should usually be considered serious. 
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that 
do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Recording and Follow-up of AE and/or SAE 
AE and SAE Recording 
 When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event. 
 The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information (including event term, 
start and stop dates, severity, relationship to study treatment, outcome, if serious or non-
serious) in the CRF. Each event must be recorded separately. 
 It is not  acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopies of the subject’s medical records 
to IQVIA Lifecycle Safety in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE CRF page. 
 There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by 
IQVIA Lifecycle Safety/Sponsor. In this case, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the 
subject number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to 
IQVIA Lifecycle Safety/Sponsor. 
 The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual 
signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. 
Assessment of Intensity 
The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study and assign it to 1 of the following categories:  
 Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with everyday activities. 
 Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday 
activities. 
 Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe 
should not be confused with a SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an 
event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. 
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. 
 
Etokimab for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis Version 2.0 
Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  94 Assessment of Causality 
 The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE. The AE must be characterized as unrelated, possibly related, 
related  
o “Unrelated”: clinical event with an incompatible time relationship to study treatment 
administration, and that could be explained by an underlying condition or other drugs 
or chemicals or is incontrovertibly not related to the study treatment.  
o “Possibly related”: clinical event with a reasonable time relationship to study 
treatment administration, and that is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent condition 
or other drugs or chemicals. 
o “Related”: clinical event with plausible time relationship to study treatment 
administration and that cannot be explained by concurrent condition or other drugs or 
chemicals. 
 The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. 
 Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, 
as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration will be 
considered and investigated. 
 The Investigator will also consult the IB in his/her assessment. 
 For each AE/SAE, the Investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. 
 There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred, and the Investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to IQVIA Lifecycle Safety. However, it is very 
important that the Investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before 
the initial transmission of the SAE data to IQVIA Lifecycle Safety. 
 The Investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information 
and send a SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment. 
 The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements. 
 
Follow-up of AEs and SAEs 
 The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by IQVIA Lifecycle 
Safety to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This 
may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals. 
 If a subject died during participation in the study, the Investigator will provide IQVIA 
Lifecycle Safety with a copy of any postmortem findings. 
 New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF. 
 The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the IQVIA Lifecycle Safety  within 
24
 hours of receipt of the information.

Protocol ANB020-005 – Amendment 3 02 Jul 2019 
AnaptysBio, Inc.  Confidential  95 Reporting of SAEs 
SAE Reporting to IQVIA Lifecycle Safety via an Electronic Data Collection Tool 
 The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to IQVIA Lifecycle Safety will be the 
electronic data collection tool. 
 If the electronic system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the study center will use 
the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section). 
 The study center will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available. 
 After the study is completed at a given study center, the EDC tool will be taken off-line to 
prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data. 
 If a study center receives a report of a new SAE from a subject or receives updated data on a 
previously reported SAE after the EDC tool has been taken off-line, then the study center can 
report this information on a paper SAE form (see next section) and send the paper SAE form 
to IQVIA Lifecycle Safety team via facsimile transmission or email. 
 Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in SAE reporting form. 
 
SAE Reporting to IQVIA Lifecycle Safety via Paper Case Report Form 
 Facsimile transmission of the SAE paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this 
information to the IQVIA Lifecycle Safety team. 
 In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by telephone is 
acceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight mail or courier 
service. 
 Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the Investigator to complete 
and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames. 
 Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in SAE reporting form.

Findings in animal toxicity studies demonstrated the lack of systemic toxicity and no clearly 
adverse local effects in the GI tract. The pot ential adverse effects from GLY-200 in humans are 
therefore anticipated to be based on local tolerance effects to the GI tract and decreased 
nutritional uptake. In the Phase 1 MAD study where subjects were dosed for up to 5 days, the 
most common reported AEs were: 
•N a u s e a
• Decreased appetite
• Vomiting
• Abdominal distension
• Flatulence
• Diarrhea
• Constipation
• Headache
• Abdominal discomfort
• Eructation
• Dry mouth
• Abdominal pain upper
• Dyspepsia
Allergic Reactions
As with any drug, there is the chance of an allergic reaction that may include difficulty breathing, 
rash, flushing, weakness, lightheadedness, dizziness, and swelling. 
Blood Sampling
There is some risk of pain or local bruising and infection at the site where blood is drawn for 
laboratory tests. There is also a small risk of a fainting episode, which can occur as a reaction to 
giving blood.
The total amount of blood that will be collected over the course of screening and the 21-day 
study is 600 mL. The total amount of blood that will be collected is less than 1.5 standard 
blood donations. There is a risk that subjects may experience anemia.
Electrocardiograms
Up to 12 self-adhesive electrodes will be attached to the subject’s skin on their arms, legs, and chest. The areas where the electrodes will be placed  will be cleaned; some areas may need to be 
shaved. Some skin irritation can occur where the electrodes are placed.
KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS 
Information from this study may help Investig ators and the Sponsor learn more about GLY-200
and its ability to improve the management of uncontrolled glycemia and increased weight in 
patients with T2D. This information ma y help other subjects in future studies.

Respiratory, Gastrointestinal, Renal, Neurol ogical, Musculoskeletal, Skin, Other. All other 
scheduled examinations will be symptom-directed.
All physical examinations are to be conduc ted by a medically qualified Investigator.
ABDOMINAL EXAMINATION
Abdominal examinations are to include at a minimum palpation, auscultation (noting presence 
and frequency of bowel sounds), and percussion (l ooking for signs of peritonitis or localized 
tenderness). Abdominal examinati ons are to be conducted at the study visits indicated in the SoA 
prior to dosing.
Besides local gastrointestinal tolerability effects, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and 
constipation, there is a theoretical risk of small or large bowel obstruction. To mitigate this risk, 
particular attention will be  applied for abdominal examination, w ith particular interest in signs of 
obstruction (reduced bowel sounds, decreased stool, bilious vomiting, and abdominal discomfort 
and distension). If an obstruction is suspected, the subject will be transferred to a medical facility 
and an abdominal X-ray obtained as well as  other imaging that may be appropriate.
VITAL SIGNS
Vital signs will be measured by a qualified staff member. Vital signs assessments will include 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate , respiratory rate, and body temperature. Patients 
should be resting in a supine position for at least 5 minutes prior to and during vital signs 
measurements. 
ELECTROCARDIOGRAMS
Twelve-lead ECGs will be assessed (including but not limited to the measurements of ventricular

heart rate (HR), PR interval, respiratory rate ( RR), QRS duration, QT interval and QT interval 
corrected by the Fridericia’s formula [QTcF]). Screening and prior to first dose, triplicate 12-lead 
ECGs each separated by at least 1 minute will be taken to establish eligibility at baseline. The 
average value for the triplicate will be utilized for assessing QT interval corrected using 
Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) exclusion criteria. All other post-first dose ECGs will be single readings. However, if any of the ECG measurements is out of normal range, it will be repeated in 
triplicate (separated by at least 1 minute).
ECG normal ranges are as follows:
• PR interval: 120 msec – 220 msec (inclusive);
• QRS duration: < 120 msec;
•47F)  PVHF PDOHV 47F)  PVHFI emales);
• HR 45-100 beats/min (inclusive)
If the “re-check” triplicate’s average is still above these parameters, the PI shall be notified for a 
determination on further action. The same model of ECG machine should be used for Screening, 
pre-dose and post-dose readings for all patients. ECGs will be taken after at least 5 minutes in a 
supine quiet rest. ECGs will be interpreted, signed and dated by the PI, or medically qualified 
designee. The ECGs will be classified as normal, not having a clinically significant abnormality or having a clinically significant abnormality. In addition, ECG parameters of HR, PR interval, 
QT interval, PR interval, RR interval, QRS duration, and QTcF will be noted on the eCRF. All 
clinically significant findings will be recorded as AEs. Clinical staff are required to perform 
ECG assessments at the nominated time-points wi thin the time windows indicated in the SoA.  
CLINICAL LABORATORY EVALUATIONS
Subjects will be required to fast for at least 8 hours prior to clinical laboratory blood sample 
collection. Samples for local clinical laboratory analysis will be collected by a qualified staff 
member. All safety laboratory assessments will be assessed by a certified local laboratory, using the relevant laboratory’s internal and standard normal range values.
At a minimum, the following tests will be conducted:
•Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell indices, thrombocyte count 
(platelets), reticulocyte c ount, white blood cell count with differential (including 
neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes and monocytes). 
•Coagulation: international normalized ratio, prothrombin time and activated partial 
thromboplastin time. 
•Chemistry: sodium, potassium, magnesium, chlo ride, bicarbonate, phosphate, calcium, 
amylase, lipase, uric acid, albumin, globulin s, protein, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine 
kinase, creatinine (estimated glomerular filtration rate), blood urea nitrogen, alkaline 
phosphatase, ALT, AST, GGT, total bilirubi n, conjugated and unc onjugated bilirubin, 
total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins, triglycerides, glucose. Vitamin and mineral pane ls will be evaluated per the SoA.
•Urinalysis: pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose,  ketones, bilirubin, blood, nitrites, 
urobilinogen, leukocyte esterase. Urine sed iment microscopy will be  conducted in the

laboratory test results prior to first dose. The subject must not be treated on Day 1 if the subject has any clinically significant laboratory abnorma lities as defined in the eligibility criteria. 
The Investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the eCRF.
PREGNANCY TEST
Blood samples for serum pregnancy analysis will be collected from all female subjects by a 
qualified staff member.
Serum and urine human chorionic gonadotropi n pregnancy testing will be performed.
Any positive urine pregnancy test will be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test.
OTHER LABORATORY TESTS
• Serology: HIV, HBsAg, HCV antibodies 
• Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estrad iol levels (for post-menopausal females only)
• Drugs of abuse screen: The urine screen will include methamphetamines, opiates, cocaine, 
phencyclidine, benzodiazepines, barb iturates, methadone, amphetamines. 
FLUID BALANCE
Urine samples will be taken for volume over a 24-hour period and compared with intake of fluids 
to provide the fluid balance. 
DOCUMENTATION OF FOOD INTAKE
During the inpatient period, food intake (date, time, and quantity [% consumed based on visual 
estimation]) will be documented daily.
FOOD INTAKE AND APPETITE ASSESSMENTS
Food intake and appetite assessme nts will be performed at breakfast and dinner on Days -1, 1, 
and 13 to assess changes in food intake, kcals, and macronutrients based on food weight 
consumed and nutrient analysis.

AEs of Special Interest 
The following are considered AEs of special interest in this study:
xHyperglycemia with evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or impending DKA : A blood glucose 
value > 300 mg/dL with symptoms of DKA (e.g., nausea, dizziness, abdominal pain, lethargy) and 
capillary ketones > 1.5 mmol/L or urine ketone positivity
xClinically significant hypoglycemia : A blood glucose measurement of <54 mg/dL (<3.0 mmol/L) that 
may or may not have immediate symptoms depending on the level of hypoglycemia unawareness
DEFINITION OF SAE
An SAE is defined as any serious adverse event that, at any dose:
1. Results in death
2. Is life-threatening
xThe term ‘life-threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in which the subject was at 
risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have 
caused death, if it were more severe.
3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
xIn general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been admitted (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during 
hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.
xHospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
xThe term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.
xThis definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
6. Is an important medical event, defined as an event that does not fit one of the other outcomes, but may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention (treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes
xExamples of such events include intensive treatment for allergic bronchospasm (a serious problem with 
breathing) requiring treatment in an emergency room, serious blood dyscrasias (blood disorders), seizure/convulsion that does not result in hospitalization or development of intervention dependency or intervention abuse.

DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP) 
UP Definition
xAn unanticipated problem is defined as, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of 
the following criteria: 
oUnexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; 
oRelated or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is areasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research); and 
oSuggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.
  
RECORDING AND FOLLOW-UP OF AE AND/OR SAE
AE and SAE Recording
xSerious Adverse Events (SAEs) should be reported to the Sponsor and/or CRO within 24 hours from 
the discovery of the event. 
xWhen an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g., 
hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event.
xThe Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information.
xThe Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of Severity
The investigator will make an assessment of severity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and assign it 
to 1 of the following categories: 
xMild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering 
with everyday activities.
xModerate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort to interfere with normal everyday activities.
xSevere: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be 
confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and 
SAEs can be assessed as severe.
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.
Assessment of Relationship to Study Agent
The relationship of the study treatment to an AE will be determined by the Investigator based on the following 
definitions:  
1. Not Related 
The AE is not related if (1) administration of the study medication has not occurred or (2) the occurrence of 
the AE is not reasonabl y related in time or(3) the AE is considered related to another event, medical 
Protocol GLY-200-02 AM02V01

Confidential              49 
Assessment of Relationship to Study Agent
condition or product not associated with the study medication (such as disease progression, environmental 
factors, unrelated trauma, etc.) 
2.  Unlikely Related
The AE is unlikely related if (1) the AE is unlikely related in time or(2) the AE is considered unlikely to be 
related to use of the study medication (i.e., there are no facts [evidence] or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship), orthe AE is considered possibly related to another event, medical condition or product not 
associated with the study medication. 
3.  Possibly Related
The AE is possibly related if (1) the study medication and AE are considered reasonably related in time and
(2) the AE could equally be explained by causes other than exposure to the study medication. 
4.  Probably Related
The AE is probably related if (1) the study medication and AE are considered reasonably related in time and 
(2) the study medication is more likely than other causes to be responsible for the AE or is the most likely cause of the AE.
xThe Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
xAlternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration will be considered and investigated.
xThere may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the Investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report (refer to Section 10.2.5 ). However, it is very important that the Investigator 
always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data (refer to Section 10.2.5 ). 
xThe Investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information and send an SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.
xThe causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.
Assessment of Expectedness
xThe Sponsor will be responsible for determining whether an AE/SAE is expected or unexpected.
xAn AE/SAE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study agent in the IB or is not listed in the IB at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
REPORTING OF SAES
SAE Reporting to Sponsor and IRB
xAny AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF. 
xAll SAEs must be reported by email to Sponsor Drug Safety or its designee within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s knowledge of the event. 
oSponsor Drug Safety Contact Information: SAE@glyscend.com   
oProSciento Safety Team Email: pvsafety@prosciento.com
xThe Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent. This 
requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) that occur during the study (from the time the participant si
gns informed consent until post-treatment follow up visit, or an y SAE made known to the

SAE Reporting to Sponsor and IRB
Investigator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP). Serious adverse events 
occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be captured.
xThe SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE and include a concise summary of hospital records and other relevant documents. If a participant died and an autopsy has been performed, copies of the autopsy report and death certificate are to be sent to Sponsor Drug Safety or its designee as soon as these become available. Any follow-up data should be detailed in a subsequent SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form, and sent to Sponsor Drug Safety or its designee. 
xWhere required by local legislation, the Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB/EC of the SAE and providing them with all relevant initial and follow-up information about the event. The Investigator must keep copies of all SAE information on file including correspondence with Sponsor and the IRB/EC.
xDetails will be provided in the Safety Management Plan (SMP).
xThere may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by the Sponsor. In this case, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the subject number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to Sponsor.
REPORTING OF UPS
Unanticipated Problem Reporting
xIncidents or events that meet the criteria for unanticipated problem require the creation and completion of an UP report. It is the site Investigator’s responsibility to report UPs to their IRB and to the Sponsor. The 
UP report will include the following information: 
oProtocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number; 
oA detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome; 
oAn explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome represents an UP; and 
oA description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are proposed in response to the UP. 
xTo satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline: 
oUPs that are SAEs will be reported to the IRB and to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event. 
oAny other UP will be reported to the IRB and to the Sponsor within the IRB-required reporting timeframe. 
oAll UPs should be reported to approp riate institutional officials (as required by an institution’s 
written reporting procedures) and IRB within the timeframe specified by the institution procedures and IRB.

Title  of Study:  
A Study  to Compare  the Efficacy of  SEL-212 to KRYSTEXXA® in Gout  Patients  Refractory 
to Conventional Therapy  
Study  Center(s):  approximately  60 study  centers  in the United States  
Studied  Period  (years):  
Estimated  date first patient  enrolled:  28 February  2019 
Estimated date last patient completed: 31 July 2020  
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• To assess  the reduction  in serum  uric acid (SUA)  in patients  treated  with SEL-212 
compared to KRYSTEXXA® 
Secondary:  
Secondary  objectives  are to assess  improvement  of the following  parameters  in patients 
treated with SEL -212 compared to KRYSTEXXA:  
• Gout  flares  
• SUA  control  
• Joint  tenderness  and swelling  
• Quality  of life (QoL)  
Methodology:  
This study  is a randomized, open -label,  parallel -arm study  to compare  the safety and  efficacy 
profiles  of SEL-212 and KRYSTEXXA.  Approximately  150 patients  will be randomized  1:1 
PROPRIETARY AND  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE  5 OF 84

prior  to Baseline  to receive  treatment  with SEL-212 or KRYSTEXXA  for 6 months. Efficacy 
assessments, as measured by SUA levels, will be conducted at intervals that are appropriate 
to determine treatment effect differences, including at month 3  and month 6. Assessments of 
qualitative endpoints will be conducted on an assessor -blinded basis. Safety will be 
monitored throughout the study.  
Screening  Period  
After providing written informed consent, the patient is considered enrolled in the study. 
Patients will be evaluated for inclusion during the Screening Period. For all patients , the 
standard Screening Period will be up to 45 days prior to Baseline. Concurrently with the 
Screening  Period,  a premedication  period  with colchicine of  at least 7 days prior  to Baseline 
for potential gout flare will be required for all subjects, and a washout period of at least 7 
days will be required prior to Baseline for patients on any urate -lowering therapy (ULT).  
Treatment  Periods  
The total duration  of the treatment  will be 6 months.  Eligible  patients  will be randomized  1:1 
prior to  Baseline to receive SEL -212 or KRYSTEXXA.  
Study  patients  in the SEL-212 arm will receive  study  drug every  28 days coinciding  with 
Day 0 of each Treatment Period for a total of up to 6 infusions of SEL -212. 
Study patients in the KRYSTEXXA arm will receive study drug according to the 
manufacturer’s  prescribing  information, i.e.,  every  14 days coinciding  with Day 0 and Day 14 
of each Treatment Period for a total of up to 12 infusions of KRYSTEXXA.  
Prior to infusion, all patients will receive a standar dized regimen of premedication to 
minimize the potential for infusion reactions during study drug administration. After 
completing  the study  drug infusions,  patients  will remain  at the investigational  site for at least 
1 hour for safety assessments.  
With  each dose,  a blood  sample  will be drawn  for assessment  of SUA  level immediately  prior 
to infusion  (ie, Time 0h)  with SEL-212 or KRYSTEXXA,  and 1 hour after the infusion  of the 
second component of SEL -212 or of KRYSTEXXA is completed. SUA levels will be 
assessed  through  additional  post-infusion  blood  samples at  pre-determined  time points.  Every 
effort will be made to obtain blood samples at the same time of day of each study visit.  
Gout  flares  will be assessed at  every  visit.  QoL and joint swelling  and tenderness  will be 
assessed on Day 0 of Treatment Period 1 and 4, and at the end of Treatment Period 6.  
Assessments  of qualitative  endpoints  (health  questionnaires  and joint assessment)  will be 
conducted on an assessor -blinded basis.  
On dosing  days,  safety  laboratory  samples  will be collected  pre-infusion  and per Schedule  of 
Events in both the SEL -212 arm and the KRYSTEXXA arm. Concomitant medications and 
procedures and adverse events (AEs) will be monitored continuously during the study.  
Follow -Up Period  
Patients will be followed for safety monitoring for 30 (+ 4) days after their final study drug 
infusion and will have an  End of Study visit by telephone. Patients  who terminate the study 
prematurely  will have  all Early  Termination  assessme nts performed.  Patients  who terminate  
PROPRIETARY AND  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE  6 OF 84

the study  prematurely  who are unable  to be on-site for the Early  Termination  visit will be 
contacted by telephone for safety follow -up. 
Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee (DSMC)  
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be formed by charter 
to assist  in reviewing  safety data  and may provide  recommendations  to the Sponsor  regarding 
study drug dose adjustment or study termination  
Stopping  Rules  
A patient  will be withdrawn  from  study  drug for meeting  the following  stopping  rule: 
• In the SEL -212 arm: SUA level > 1.0 mg/dL measured at the Day 21 visit of 
Treatment  Period  1 or SUA  level  > 6.0  mg/dL  at the Day 21 visit of Treatment 
Periods 2, 3, 4, or 5  
• In the KRYSTEXXA  arm: SUA  level  > 6.0 mg/dL  measured  on 2 consecutive 
pre-dose measurements  
If withdrawn  from  study  drug,  the patient  will continue  study  visits  to the end of Treatment 
Period 6.

• Screened  / Randomized  Set: The Screened  Set will include  all patients  who signed  an 
informed consent. The Randomized Set will include all patients randomized.  
• Safety  Set (SS):  The Safety  Set will include  all patients  who were  administered  any 
amount of study medication. Patients will be  analyzed according to treatment 
received.  The SS will be used for all analyses of safety endpoints and for the 
presentation of patients in all patient listings.  
• Intent -to-Treat  (ITT)  Set: The Intent -to-Treat  (ITT)  Set will be used as the primary 
population for the analysis of efficacy.  The ITT Set will include all randomized 
patients. Patients will be analyzed according to randomized treatment.  
• Modified  ITT (mITT)  Set: The modified  ITT (mITT)  Set will  include  all randomized 
patients who were admin istered at least one complete dose of study medication and 
have at least one post -baseline assessment of SUA. Patients will be analyzed 
according to randomized treatment. The mITT will also be used for analyses of 
efficacy endpoints.  
• Per Protocol (PP) Set: The Per Protocol Set (PPS) will include all patients who 1) 
were administered any amount of study medication, and 2) have completed at least 
65% of the study  dosing  visits  with or without  receiving  study  drug (eg at least 4 of 6 
TP Day 0 visits  for patients  receiving SEL -212 or at least 8 of 12 TP Day 0  or Day14 
visits for patients receiving Krystexxa) unless early termination from the study 
occurred after study drug withdrawal due to meeting stopping rules or due to an 
adverse event, or due to PI di scretion (for example where at least one pre -dose SUA 
was >6 mg/dL in the Krystexxa arm and patient was discontinued from study 
treatment), and 3) who have no major Protocol deviations affecting the primary 
efficacy assessments. Patients will be analyzed a ccording to randomized treatment.  
 
Efficacy Analyses  
Primary  Efficacy  Analysis  
The primary  estimand  will take into consideration  the treatment  policy  strategy,  ie, Treatment 
Period 6 (and also Treatment Period 3) assessments will be considered  for all subjects in ITT 
independently whether the subject has completed the study treatment or has terminated early 
the study treatment. Additionally, the estimand based on the while -on-treatment strategy for 
dealing with study treatment terminators will b e defined. For all used estimands of the 
primary  efficacy,  the estimator  for the comparison  between  the treatment  groups  is defined  as 
the difference in the proportion of responders between subjects receiving SEL -212 versus 
those receiving KRYSTEXXA during  Treatment Periods 3 and 6. The statistical testing will 
be performed  confirmatory  using  the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel  (CMH)  test – considering  the 
randomization stratum of tophus presence (yes/no) – with a one -sided type 1 error rate  
α = 5%. In addition,  90% two-sided  confidence  intervals  for the overall  treatment  difference 
between SEL -212 and KRYSTEXXA treatment groups without stratification will be 
computed. The analysis of the estimands  will be carried out based on the ITT primarily.  
Supportive  analyses  will be performed  on the mITT  and the PP. For each defined  estimand 
sensitivity analyses will be performed using different imputation approaches for missing 
values. Details  of the  applied  approaches  will be presented in  the Statistical Analysis Plan.

The SUA time curve will be used to estimate the proportion of time that the SUA level is 
below 6 mg/dL. Based on the serum samples collected during Treatment Periods 3 and 6, an 
estimate of the time with SUA < 6 mg/dL can be determined by connecting each two 
neighboring data points with a straight line. If the SUA time curve goes above 6 mg/dL the 
linear interpolation method will be used to estimate the point in time at which t he SUA time 
curve  intercepts  the line between  the last SUA  value  < 6 mg/dL  and the first value  ≥ 6 mg/dL.  
The proportion  of time that the SUA  level  is < 6 mg/dL will  be computed  by taking  the ratio 
between the time during which the SUA level remains < 6 mg/dL (if necessary, using the 
linear interpolation method) and the entire time interval within Treatment Periods 3 and 6.  
Let T1 be the total time interval in hours for Treatment Period 3 of which W1 hours is the 
time interval during which SUA level is < 6 mg/dL. Similarly, for Treatment Period 6, 
assume T2 is the total time interval in hours of which W2 hours is the time interval during 
which SUA level is < 6 mg/dL. For a subject to be considered a responder, the proportion of 
time that the SUA  level  is < 6 mg/dL  during  Treatment  Periods  3 and 6 must  be at least 80%. 
The proportion of time that the SUA level is < 6 mg/dL, i.e., percentage of non - 
hyperuricemic time, is calculated using the following formula:  
𝑊1 + 𝑊2 
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  = 𝑇1 + 𝑇2 × 100  
A logistic  regression  model  controlling  for the distribution  of baseline  characteristics  will be 
performed as supportive analysis.  
Summary  tables  of the percentage  of responder  (subjects  who achieve  and maintain  reduction 
of SUA < 6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time)  in each treatment period will be provided by 
treatment group. Additionally,  a summary table with the total time a subject has SUA values  
< 6 mg/dL  will be provided  for each treatment  period  by treatment  group.  
Summary tables of the actual values and change from baseline for SUA results will be 
provided for each scheduled sampling time point by treatment group. Additionally, mean 
SUA  level,  reduction  in mean SUA  and percent  reduction  in mean SUA  from  baseline  during 
Treatment Period 3 or Treatment Period 6 will be presented by treatment group.  
Secondary Efficacy  Analyses  
All statistical tests in secondary endpoints for the comparison between SEL -212 and 
KRYSTEXXA will be performed using one -sided tests at a type 1 error rate level of  α=5%. 
In addition, 90% confidence intervals for treatment differences between SEL -212 and 
KRYSTEXXA  treatment  groups  will be computed.  The efficacy  analyses  will be carried  out 
based on the IT T and PP Sets. mITT analyses will be performed if appropriate.  
For assessment of SUA in the secondary efficacy analyses, summary tables of the number 
and percentage of subjects for each endpoint will be presented by  treatment group, and the 
comparison  betw een the treatment  groups  will be performed  similar  to the primary  efficacy 
endpoint using a CMH -test considering the randomization stratum.  
For the health  questionnaires,  comparison  with regards  to change  from  baseline  in health  
questionnaires will be performed using an ANCOVA with the respective change from 
baseline  value  as dependent  variable,  treatment  group and  the randomization  stratum  as

independent fixed factors and the baseline value as independent covariate. For each health 
questionnaire, summary tables of total scores or domain scores and subscale scores will be 
provided  for each scheduled  assessment  time by treatment  group. Additionally,  summaries  of 
the changes from baseline will be p rovided.  
The number and percentage of subjects reporting gout flares per 3 -months period, i.e. 
Treatment Periods 1 to 3 and Treatment Periods 4 to 6, will be summarized by treatment 
group and will be tested using a CMH -test considering the randomization st ratum. The 
frequency  of gout flares  will be summarized  per 3-months  period,  i.e. for Treatment  Periods  1 
to 3 and Treatment Periods 4 to 6 for each treatment and will be compared using ANOVA 
considering the randomization stratum and treatment as fixed factors.  
Comparison with regards to change of tender joints and swollen joints from baseline will be 
performed using an ANCOVA with the change from baseline value as dependent variable, 
treatment group and randomization stratum as independent fixed factors  and the baseline 
number of tender joints and swollen joints as independent covariates, respectively. In case of 
non-normality,  the non-parametric  Wilcoxon  test will be used for the comparison  between  the 
treatment groups. Summary tables of the number of t ender joints and swollen joints for each 
assessment timepoint and for the change from baseline will be provided by treatment group, 
respectively.  
A subgroup analysis will be conducted for patients who receive “additional gout flare 
treatment”  in each arm for these objectives.  Details  of this subgroup  analysis  will be provided 
in the SAP.  
Safety  Analyses  
All AEs will be coded  and grouped  into Preferred  Terms  (PT) by System  Organ  Class  (SOC), 
using the most recent MedDRA Version. All AEs will be summarized by SOC and PT. An 
overall  summary  will be provided  of the number  and percentage of  patients in  each treatment 
group (SEL -212 and KRYSTEXXA) reporting TEAEs, serious TEAEs, treatment -related 
TEAEs, AESIs, TEAEs leading  to withdrawal and TEAEs lea ding to death. The number and 
percentage of patients with TEAEs /serious TEAEs / AESIs / TEAEs leading to withdrawal / 
treatment -related TEAEs will be summarized by SOC and PT for each treatment group  
(SEL -212 and KRYSTEXXA).  TEAEs  will also be summarized  by maximum  intensity  and 
causality.  
Laboratory  data will be summarized  by the type of laboratory  test and will be presented  for 
each scheduled visit stratified by treatment group (SEL -212 and KRYSTEXXA). Normal 
reference ranges  and markedly abno rmal results  will be used  in the summary of laboratory 
data. Data will be flagged according to the reference limits (High or Low), if applicable.  
Changes from baseline will be presented for each post -baseline visit. Shift tables of the 
number of patients w ith low/normal/high values at each scheduled post -baseline visit 
compared  to the low/normal/high  categorization  at baseline  will be provided  by treatment 
group (SEL -212 and KRYSTEXXA).  
Summary  tables  of the actual  values  and changes  from  baseline  will be provided  for each 
vital sign parameter at each scheduled visit by treatment group (SEL -212 and 
KRYSTEXXA).

For each 12 -lead ECG variable the actual value and the change from baseline will be 
summarized  for the scheduled  visits  by treatment  group (SEL -212 and KRYSTEXXA).  
Frequency tables of abnormal clinically significant evaluations as well as the number and 
percentage  of patients  with noteworthy  QTcF/QTcB  values  (> 450,  > 480 and > 500 ms) and 
of patients  with noteworthy  QTcF/QTcB  changes  from  baseline  (≥ 30 but <60; ≥ 60 ms)  will 
be provided.  
Sample  Size Determination  
The primary efficacy criterion in this study is defined as the percentage of subjects who 
achieve and maintain reduction of SUA < 6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time  during 
Treatment Period 3 and Treatment Period 6. The percentage of responders according to the 
above criterion is assumed to be 65% in the SEL -212 arm and 44% in the KRYSTEXXA 
arm. Using the Chi -square test for comparison between the SEL -212 arm and the 
KRYSTEXXA arm, and considering a one -sided α=5% and the statistical power of 80%, 
results in 69 subjects per treatment group. Taking into account that some subjects may be 
excluded from the mITT analyses, 75 subjects per treatment group will be randomized.  For 
the sample size estimation, Chi -square test, instead of the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test, is 
used although  the randomization  will be stratified  for tophus  presence  (yes/no)  as there  is no 
valid assumption of the distribution of this stratification variable within the eligible subject 
population.

5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Gout  and Refractory Gout  
Gout is an intermittent inflammatory arthritis characterized by elevated uric acid levels and 
caused by the formation of urate crystals in joint fluid leading to intensely painful joint 
inflammation. Chronic hyperuricemia leads to further deposition of uric acid in soft tissues 
resulting in destructive arthritis and formation of tophi and renal calculi ( Choi 2005 , So 2008 , 
Wortmann 2008 ). Gout is a common disease with in creasing incidence, driven mainly by an 
aging  population,  with some  contribution  from  the increasing  prevalence  of obesity  and the use 
of diuretics ( Choi 2006 , Luk 2005 ). 
The incidence of gout increases as circulating uric acid levels increase ( Campion 1987 ) and 
lowering  circulating  urate  levels  is a primary  means  of managing  gout.  The American  College  of 
Rheumatology guidelines recommend lowering uric acid level to at least below 6 mg/dL and 
preferably below 5 mg/dL ( Khanna 2012a , Khanna 2012b ). 
The progression  of gout is believed  to have  4 pathophysiological  stages  (Dalbeth  2011 ): 
1. Hyperuricemia  without  monosodium  urate  crystal  deposition  or gout 
2. Crystal  deposition  without  symptomatic  gout 
3. Crystal  deposition  with acute  gout flares  
4. Advanced  or severe  gout,  characterized  by tophi,  chronic  gouty  arthritis,  and radiographic 
erosions  
 
Refractory gout is a serious condition affecting approximately 50,000 patients in  the United 
States  and is characterized  by uric acid levels  that are not adequately  controlled  by approved 
therapies.  
5.2 Symptoms  of Gout 
Symptoms and their development have a broad spectrum of severity. Most symptoms present as 
intermittent  attacks  or flares  while  others  present  as more  severe,  chronic  disease  affecting  one or 
more joints with tophi, sometimes referred to as chronic tophaceous gouty arthropathy  
(Khanna  2012a ). In chronic gout,  tophi  commonly  develop  in the fingers,  hands,  and feet around 
the ole cranon, and under the skin on the ears, but may also develop in other tissues and organs 
such as the kidneys and heart valves ( Ryan 2016 ). Pro -inflammatory cytokines and white cell 
debris are usually present in tophi, which suggest a state of chronic monosodium urate -crystal - 
stimulated inflammation ( Dalbeth 2011 ). These tophi can erupt through the skin, become 
inflame d and painful, and discharge urate crystals and eventually may cause deformities and 
secondary  osteoarthritis  (Ryan  2016 ). They  can infiltrate into  the bone,  causing  bone  erosion  and 
joint da mage ( Dalbeth 2011 ). Additional complications include obstruction of the joint and 
infection  as well as urolithiasis  with uric acid stones  or calcium  oxalate  stones  (Ryan  2016 ). The 
presence of tophi is associated with more frequent flares, which may be so painful and  
PROPRIETARY AND  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE  24 OF 84

VERSION : 3.0 EFFECTIVE  DATE  
08 JUN 2020  
  
debilitating  that they lead to joint replacement  or surgical  excision.  Over time,  flares  become 
polyarticular, additive, and increase in severity ( Brook 2010 ). 
5.3 Gout  and Hyperuricemia:  Exacerbation  of Existing  Comorbidities  
The effect of chronic, severe, refractory gout on quality of life is more pronounced in patients 
with medical  comorbidities  as these  complicate  the therapeutic  management  of their symptoms 
and increase their risk of cardiovascular events and all -cause mortality. It is also well - 
documen ted that the presence of these comorbidities has a significant impact on patients’ 
physical functioning, healthcare utilization, and quality of life ( Khanna 2012a ). 
Chronic, uncontrolled gout  and hyperuricemia are associated with metabolic disorders, type 2 
diabetes, hypertension, and renal and cardiovascular diseases ( Strand 2012 ; Becker 2009 ; 
Chandratre 2013 ). There is strong evidence that shows hyperuricemia contributes to worse 
outcomes under these conditions, and there is increasing mechanistic, e pidemiological, and 
clinical  data to indicate  that elevated  serum  uric acid (SUA)  levels  can exacerbate  and contribute 
to the progression of comorbidities ( Rock 2013 ; Mallamaci 2015 ). 
Data from 5707 patients in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
were  obtained  from  2007 -2008,  and prevalence  of major  gout comorbidities  were  correlated  with 
hyperuricemia levels ( Zhu 2012 ). This analysis revealed the presence of hypertension, chronic 
kidney disease, obesity, diabetes, nephrolithiasi s, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke 
was substantially higher in individuals with gout compared to those without gout. Furthermore, 
the prevalence of these comorbidities increased proportionally to the level of hyperuricemia,  
with the incide nce of comorbidities being highest among individuals with both gout and 
hyperuricemia.  
5.4 Impact  on Quality  of Life 
One longitudinal study in  this patient population reports  that approximately 70% of  patients  with 
chronic refractory gout have at least 1 tophus and an average of 7 flares per year. In a separate 
study  of chronic  refractory  gout,  patients  self-reported  more  than 60% of these  flares  as crippling 
(Brook 2010 ). Symptoms of pain, limited mobility, and disability are debilitating and deeply 
affect physical function and emotional and social functioning, and disease severity correlates 
with a marked compromise in quality of life ( Strand 2012 , Becker 2009 ). 
The relationship between self -reported quality of life and disability and disease severity have 
been evaluated in multiple clinical studies. Over 100 subjects with chronic refractory gout 
evaluated using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form -36 assessment, and results revealed 
that patients  with chronic  refractory  gout have significantly  lower  subscales  analogous  to those 
of 75 -year old individuals ( Becker 2009 ). Specifically, disease severity, as characterized by 
number of flares in the past year, number of tender or swollen joints, or presence of tophi, 
significantly  correlates  with worse  quality  of life scores  in all areas,  which  include  bodily  pain, 
general health, mental health, physical functioning and vitality. Subjects with comorbidities  
PROPRIETARY AND  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE  25 OF 84  
  STUDY : SEL-212/202 
VERSION : 3.0 EFFECTIVE  DATE  
08 JUN 2020  
  
experienced  worse  physical  functioning.  Notably,  their scores  did not improve  over the 52-week 
period despite undergoing maximal medical management ( Strand 2012 ). 
There is also evidence that gout affects workplace productivity, as studies in patients with 
chron ic, refractory  gout self-report  work  absences  due to flares,  losing  25.1 workdays  on average 
per year.  Another study specifically found employees with gout missed 4.56 more days of work 
per year than those without gout ( Edward s 2011 ). 
Hospitalizations  with a principal diagnosis  of gout has  steadily increased over the past 2 decades 
(Lim 2016 ). In contrast, hospitalizations due to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has dramatically 
decreased over this same time period correlating with the development of effective biologic 
drugs to treat RA.  In 2005, the number of hosp italizations due to gout exceeded the number of 
hospitalizations  due to RA, and this gap has steadily  increased.  Hospitalization  costs  for gout and 
RA show a similar trend. Similarly, general population studies have shown a substantial 
reduction  in prematu re death  due in RA patients  but not in gout  patients  (Rai 2016 ). The findings 
likely reflect lack of effective therapies for severe gout.  
Together, these data show that the burden of chronic, severe, refractory gout extends well 
beyond that of physical discomfort, affecting almost every domain of life thus stressing the 
seriousness of the disease and an unmet need for new therapies given its refractory nature. 
Lowering serum urate levels can prevent further deposition of urate crystals, thus leading to a 
reduction in flare in cidence and resolution of existing tophi. The American College of 
Rheumatology  guidelines  recommend  a target  serum  urate  of less than 6 mg/dL  for patients  on 
urate lowering therapy, with a target of less than 5 mg/dL for patients with chronic, severe 
disea se, because this level is associated with more rapid resolution of tophi ( Dalbeth 2011 ). 
5.5 Approved  Therapies  for Chronic  Gout  Refractory  to Conventional  Therapy 
An estimated 160,000 gout patients fail to normalize their levels of SUA, have symptoms that 
are uncontrolled  with the currently  available  treatments  aimed  at lowering  urate  levels,  or suffer 
from comorbidities that preclude their use of conventional therapies ( Richette 2013 , Strand  
2012 ). Lack of treatment options leads to unabated disease progression.  
Currently, conventional therapies for the treatment of gout involve the inhibition of uric acid 
production and  the improvement of uric acid renal clearance.  The administration of  exogenous 
uricase, an enzyme not present in hum ans that converts uric acid into the water -soluble 
compound,  allantoin,  is used only in instances  of gout that is refractory  to first and second  lines 
of therapy ( Dalbeth 2011 ). 
There  are 2 uricase  products  currently  used to treat hyperuricemia:  rasburicase  (ELITEK®) and 
pegloticase (Krystexxa®). 
PROPRIETARY AND  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE  26 OF 84  
  STUDY : SEL-212/202 
VERSION : 3.0 EFFECTIVE  DATE  
08 JUN 2020  
  
Rasburicase is a recombinant, unpegylated  urate -oxidase enzyme produced by genetically 
modified  S. cerevisiae . It is indicated  for tumor  lysis syndrome,  and its use in treating  gout is off- 
label. Its clinical use in gout is limited because it is highly immunogenic and has a short plasma 
half-life at approximately  18 to 24 hours,  making  it an unsuitable  treatment  for chronic  refractory 
gout ( Terkeltaub 2009 ). 
Pegloticase is a pegylated recombinant porcine - or baboon -derived uricase. It is currently the 
only FDA -approved  product  for the treatment  of chronic  gout refractory to  conventional  therapy 
(KRYSTEXXA Prescribing Information 2018 ). While its use is associated with  improvements in 
musculoskeletal  function,  quality  of life, and pain,  only approximately  42% of patients  maintain 
a target serum urate level less than 6 mg/dL after 6 months of the approved dose regimen of  
8 mg once every 2 weeks. The vast majority of patients (92%) develop anti -pegloticase 
antibodies. High titer antibodies appear to adversely affect the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynam ics of the enzyme  and are associated  with a decrease  in therapeutic  response  and 
increased risk of infusion reactions. Approximately 26% of patients taking Krystexxa report 
infusion reactions, 6.5% experience anaphylaxis, and the incidence of infusion reac tions 
correlate with high anti -pegloticase antibody titer. These adverse events are typically preceded 
by a loss of urate -lowering effects.  
In addition to infusion reactions and gout flares, the most common adverse reactions with 
Krystexxa  are nausea,  contusion,  nasopharyngitis,  constipation,  chest  pain,  anaphylaxis,  and 
vomiting. In  the 2 pivotal  trials, there were 4 reported  cases  of exacerbations  of pre -existing 
congestive heart failure in subjects receiving Krystexxa every 2 weeks.  
The high rate of treatment  failure  and the potential  for anaphylactic  reactions  have  resulted  in 
limited use of Krystexxa since its approval.  
5.6 Unmet  Medical  Need  
Current, approved uricase products carry substantial safety risks associated with 
immunogenicity,  including  anaphylaxis,  as well as reduced  efficacy  over time as antibodies 
develop against the exogenous enzyme.  
Selecta  Biosciences  has developed SEL -212, the first drug product  designed  to reduce  or prevent 
an immunologic response and improve efficacy, safety, and  tolerability of a uricase enzyme 
(pegadricase) in patients who require long -term treatment to manage symptoms and  progression 
of chronic refractory gout. Selecta uses its proprietary, antigen -specific Synthetic Vaccine 
Particle (SVP) platform to encapsula te the approved immunomodulatory drug, rapamycin, to 
mitigate formation of anti -drug antibodies by inducing antigen -specific regulatory T cells.  
Selecta  is leveraging  its nanoparticle  technology  encapsulating rapamycin  (SVP -rapamycin)  with 
the goal of inducing durable antigen -specific immune tolerance to pegadricase, a pegylated 
uricase. Specifically, SEL -212, in its current formulation, is a combination intravenous drug 
product that consists of a pegylated recombinant uricase (pegadric ase; SEL -037) and a  
PROPRIETARY AND  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE  27 OF 84

biodegradable  nanoparticle  containing  rapamycin  (SEL -110.36),  a small  molecule  inhibitor  of 
the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Pegadricase is derived from Candida 
utilis and metabolizes poorly soluble uric acid to the more soluble metabolite, allantoin.  
Administration  of SEL-110.36  just prior  to pegadricase is  intended  to induce  immune  tolerance 
to prevent the formation of anti -uricase antibodies that may compromise efficacy or safety of 
pegadricase.  
The development  of SEL-212 remains  focused  on mitigating  the formation  of antidrug  antibodies 
with the goal of providing a product with better efficacy and safety profiles in patients than the 
only approved available therapy.

7. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
7.1 Overall  Study  Design  
This study is a randomized, open -label, parallel -arm study  to compare the safety and  efficacy 
profiles of SEL -212 and KRYSTEXXA. Approximately 150 patients wi ll be randomized 1:1 
prior to Baseline to receive treatment with  SEL-212 or KRYSTEXXA for 6 months. Efficacy 
assessments,  as measured  by SUA  levels,  will be conducted  at intervals  that are appropriate  to 
determine treatment effect differences, including at month 3 and month 6. Assessments of 
qualitative  endpoints  will be conducted  on an assessor -blinded  basis.  Safety  will be monitored 
throughout the study.  
The study  will be divided  into 3 study  periods:  Screening,  Treatment,  and Follow -up, described 
below. The study is depicted schematically in Figure 1 . 
The total duration of participation in the study will range from approximately 26 to 31  weeks 
(184 to 219 days)  for patients  randomized  to SEL-212 and approximately 28  to 33 weeks  (198 to 
233 days) for patients randomized to KRYSTEXXA as follows:  
• Screening  and/or  washout  and premedication  period:  up to 45 days (up to 6.5 weeks)  
• Treatment:  168 days (24 weeks)  for SEL-212 KRYSTEXXA  
• Safety  Follow -Up: 30 (+ 4) days after the  date of last  infusion  
o SEL-212: Last scheduled  infusion  on Study  Day 140 
o KRYSTEXXA:  Last schedule  infusion  on Study  Day 154 
7.1.1 Screening  Period  
After  providing  written  informed  consent,  the patient  is considered  enrolled  in the study.  Patients 
will be evaluated for inclusion during the Screening Period. For all patients, the standard 
Screening Period will be up to 45 days prior to Baseline. Concurrently with the Screening 
Period, a premedication period with colchicine of at least 7 days prior to Baseline for potential 
gout flare will be required for all subjects, and a washout period of at least 7 days will be 
required prior to Baseline for p atients on any urate -lowering therapy (ULT).  
7.1.2 Treatment  Period  
The total duration  of treatment  will be 6 months.  Eligible  patients  will be randomized  1:1 prior  to 
Baseline to receive SEL -212 or KRYSTEXXA.  
Study  patients  in the SEL-212 arm will receive  study  drug every  28 days coinciding  with Day 0 
of each Treatment Period for a total of up to 6 infusions of SEL -212. 
Study  patients  in the KRYSTEXXA  arm will receive study  drug according  to the manufacturer’s 
prescribing  information,  i.e., every  14 days coinciding  with Day  0 and Day 14 of each Treatment 
Period for a total of up to 12 infusions of KRYSTEXXA.

Prior to infusion, all patients will receive a standardized regimen of premedication to minimize 
the potential  for infusion  reactions  during  study  drug administration.  After  completing  the study 
drug infusions, patients will remain at the investigational site for at least 1 hour for safety 
assessments.  
Refer  to Section 10 for details  about  study  drug administration.  
 
With  each dose,  a blood  sample  will be drawn  for assessment  of SUA  level immediately  prior  to 
infusion (ie, Time 0h) with SEL -212 or KRYSTEXXA, 1 hour after the infusion of the second 
component of SEL -212 or of KRYSTEXXA is completed. SUA levels will be assessed through 
additional post -infusion blood samples at  pre-determined time points. Every effort  will be made 
to obtain blood samples at the same time of day of  each study visit.  
Gout  flares  will be assessed at  every  visit.  QoL and joint swelling  and tenderness  will be 
assessed on Day 0 of Treatment Period 1 and 4, and at the end of Treatment Period 6.  
Assessments  of qualitative  endpoints  (health  questionnaires  and joint assessment) will  be 
conducted on an assessor -blinded basis.  
On dosing  days,  safety  laboratory  samples  will be collected  pre-infusion  and per Schedule  of 
Events in both the SEL -212 arm and the KRYSTEXXA arm. Concomitant medications and 
procedures and adverse events (AEs) will be monitored continuously during the study.  
7.1.3 Follow -Up Period  
Patients will be followed for safety monitoring for 30 (+ 4) days after their final study drug 
infusion and will have an End of Study visit by telephone. Patients who terminate the study 
prematurely  will have all Early  Termination  assessments  performed.  Patients who  terminate  the 
study  prematurely  who are unable  to be on-site for the Early  Termination  visit will be contacted 
by telephone for safety follow -up.

Period  1 or SUA  level  > 6.0  mg/dL  at the Day 21 visit of Treatment  Periods  2, 3, 4, or 5 
 
The window  for all Day 21 visits  is -2/+1 days.  
 
If a Day 21 visit SUA value drawn within the protocol window is not available, but if a SUA 
value  drawn  at an unscheduled  visit after the Day 21 window  is available  prior  to dosing  that is 
≤ 1.0 mg/dL during  Treatment Period 1 or  ≤ 6.0 mg/dL during  Treatment Periods 2,  3, 4, or 5, 
the patient  will not be required  to be withdrawn from  study  drug and may be eligible  to receive 
their subsequent dose.  
If 1) a Day 21 visit SUA value drawn within the protocol window is not available and no 
subsequent SUA results are available or 2) a Day 21 visit SUA value drawn within the protocol 
window is not available and a subsequent SUA drawn at an unscheduled visit after the Day 21 
window  is > 1.0 mg/dL during  Treatment  Period  1 or > 6.0 mg/dL  during  Treatment  Periods  2, 3, 
4, or 5, then the patient will be withdrawn from study drug based on the protocol deviation.  
If withdrawn from study drug, the patient will continue study visits to the end of Treatment 
Period 6. At the discretion o f the Investigator, the patient will be permitted to return to urate 
lowering  therapy  60 days after the patient’s  last study  drug treatment.  Urate  lowering  therapy 
shall not be SEL -212 or KRYSTEXXA.  
7.4.1.2  KRYSTEXXA  
A patient  randomized  to treatment  with KRYSTEXXA  and who has started  receiving  treatment 
with study drug will be withdrawn from study drug for meeting the following stopping rule:  
• In the KRYSTEXXA  arm: SUA  level  > 6.0 mg/dL  measured  on 2 consecutive  pre-dose 
measurements, based on the following  assessments:  
o If a pre-dose SUA  level  is > 6.0 mg/dL,  then the Investigator  will have  the option  to 
schedule a second SUA measurement to occur 2 days before the next scheduled 
KRYSTEXXA dosing day. The pre -dose SUA collected on Day 0 of Treatment 
Period 1 shall not be used in determining whether to invoke the stopping rule.  
o If the second  measured  SUA  level  is > 6.0 mg/dL,  then the Investigator  will withdraw 
the patient from study drug per the stopping rule.

08 JUN 2020  
  
o If the second  measured  SUA  level  is ≤ 6.0 mg/dL,  the patient  can proceed  to dosing 
with KRYSTEXXA. However, SUA will be assessed on the day of dosing, per 
protocol, to be used determining consecutive pre -dose measurements for future 
stopping rules.  
 
If withdrawn from study drug, the patient will continue study visits to the end of Treatment 
Period 6. At the discretion of the Investigator, the patient will be permitted to return to urate 
lowering  therapy  60 days after the patient’s  last study  drug treatme nt. Urate  lowering  therapy 
shall not be SEL -212 or KRYSTEXXA.  
7.4.2 Criteria  for Adjustment  or Stopping  Doses  
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be formed by charter to 
assist  in reviewing  safety  data and may provide  recommendations  to the Sponsor  regarding  study 
drug dose adjustment or study termination.  
7.5 Criteria  for Study  Termination  
The study can be terminated  at any  time at the Sponsor’s sole discretion. Otherwise,  the study 
will be terminated  when  all patients  have  completed  follow -up assessments  (Section  20) or the 
Sponsor or regulatory agency(ies) have determined there is an unacceptable risk to patients or 
additional dosing or procedures are not war ranted or necessary.  
The study  may be terminated  at a particular  investigational  site under  the following  conditions:  
• The Investigator  fails to enroll  patients  at an acceptable rate; 
• The Investigator  fails to comply  with pertinent  regulations;  
• There  is insufficient  adherence  (i.e., compliance)  to the protocol;  
• Knowingly  false information  is submitted  to the IRB,  Sponsor  or designee,  or regulatory 
authorities.  
7.6 Study  Rationale  
7.6.1 Rationale  for the Study  Design  
Study  SEL-212/202  is a randomized,  open -label,  parallel -arm study  to compare  the safety and 
efficacy profiles of SEL -212 to KRYSTEXXA.  
A randomized, controlled study is the gold -standard for evaluation of efficacy in clinical 
research.  Randomized,  controlled  studies  are quantitative,  compar ative,  controlled  experiments 
in which treatment effect sizes may be determined with less bias than observational trials.  
Randomization  is considered  the most  powerful  experimental  design  in clinical  trials:  with other 
variables  equal between groups, on average, any differences  in outcome can be attributed to the 
intervention.  
The study will be conducted on an open -label treatment basis; therefore, all patients, 
Investigators,  study  personnel,  and Sponsor  personnel  involved  in the conduct  of the study  will 
PROPRIETARY AND  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE  34 OF 84  
  STUDY : SEL-212/202 
VERSION : 3.0 EFFECTIVE  DATE  
08 JUN 2020  
  
have access to the randomized treatment assignments. Only the assessments of qualitative 
endpoints (health questionnaires and joint assessment) will be conducted on an assessor -blinded 
basis.  The open -label  design  was selected  because  of the substantial  differences  in administration 
of SEL -212 and KRYSTEXXA ( Section 10) and the practicality of maintaining the treatment 
blind. The parallel  arms  involving active treatment will permit  adequate statistical  comparison of 
the groups for efficacy and safety signal detection.  
KRYSTEXXA was sel ected as the active comparator because it is approved for this patient 
population  and because  the exogenous  protein  carries  similar  risks  to the SEL-037 component  of 
SEL-212. 
7.6.2 Rationale  for the Study  Population  
The selection of  this study population ( Section 8) is based primarily on the desired therapeutic 
indication  that the Sponsor  will seek.  Other  selection  criteria  were  set in order  to maximize  the 
ability to detect efficacy signals while minimizing any undue risk to the enrolled patients.  
Therefore, the severity and refractoriness of the patient’s disease and SUA level are key 
Inclusion Criteria ( Section 8.1). In order to enhance the safety of patients on treatment, key 
Exclusion  Criteria  involve  history  of severe  allergies  or allergies  to products  that have similar 
features to the components of SEL -212, medical factors that might be exacerbated while on  
treatment, and prior exposure to experimental or marketed uricase therapies.  
7.6.3 Rationale  for the Selected  Dose  
Dose selection for  this study was based on safety and efficacy analyses of the clinical 
development program for SEL -212, beginning with a complete d Phase 1b study 
(Study  SEL-212/101:  “A Phase  I Single  Ascending  Dose  Safety,  Pharmacokinetic  and 
Pharmacodynamics Study of SEL -212 in Subjects with Elevated Blood Uric Acid,”  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  ) and a currently  ongoing  Phase  2 study  (Study  SEL-212/201:  “An Open  Label 
Phase II Multiple Dose Safety, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamics Study of SEL -212 
Followed by Open Label Administration of SEL -037 in Subjects with Symptomatic Gout and 
Elevated Blood Uric Acid ,” [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
Doses  of KRYST EXXA  selected  for this study  are based  on the manufacturer’s  approved 
labeling ( KRYSTEXXA Prescribing Information 2018 ). 
7.6.3.1  Phase  1b Study  with SEL -212 
This was a Phase  1b double -blind,  sequential,  single -ascending -dose study  (SEL -110; Cohorts  1, 
3, 5, and 7) combined with an open label, single -ascending -dose study (SEL -212; Cohorts 2, 4, 
6, 10, 12 and 14) to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of SEL -212 and SEL -110. 
Additionally, the study was to assess the PD (ability to reduce  SUA) and immunogenicity 
(ability  to prevent  ADAs  to uricase  and pegadricase)  of SEL -212. Generally,  patients  were  dosed 
on a cohort basis in an ascending stepwise manner. A control group was dosed with SEL -037 
only.  
PROPRIETARY AND  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE  35 OF 84  
  STUDY : SEL-212/202 
VERSION : 3.0 EFFECTIVE  DATE  
08 JUN 2020  
  
In the Phase 1b study, patients (N = 64) with a serum uric acid  level ≥  6 mg/dL, with or without  
a history of gout, were administered SVP -rapamycin alone, pegadricase alone, or SEL -212 as an 
intravenous infusion. Mitigation of ADAs and a dose -dependent reduction in SUA levels 
occurred  from  study  Day 1 to Day 30 in patients  administered SEL -212 (data  on file).  There  was 
no effect of SVP -rapamycin alone on SUA levels, and patients administered pegadricase alone 
developed ADAs that resulted in loss of SUA control by Day 14. SEL -212 was generally well 
tolerated at all dose levels. The maximum tolerated dos e of SVP -rapamycin was determined to  
be 0.3 mg/kg. Data from this study were used to select additional dose levels of each  component 
of SEL -212 for evaluation in the currently ongoing Phase 2 study SEL -212/201.  
7.6.3.2  Phase  2 Study  with SEL -212 
The Phase 2 study SEL-212/201 was designed as an open -label, multiple -dose clinical study of 
the combination drug, SEL -212, which was combined with an open -label, multiple -dose 
evaluation of pegadricase alone (SEL -037). Part A of the study consisted of three 28 -day 
treatmen t cycles  of SEL -212, which  was then followed  by Part B, which consisted  of two 28-day 
treatment cycles of SEL -037 alone, with  a primary objective of assessing the safety,  tolerability, 
PK, PD of SEL -212 (i.e., the combination of SEL -110 and SEL-037). Part C of the study 
consisted of five 28 -day treatment cycles of SEL -212 with a primary objective of assessing the 
safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of SEL -212. Additional assessments include the ability of  
SEL-212 to reduce  serum  uric acid levels  and prevent  anti-drug antibodies  to uricase,  PEG,  and 
pegadricase.  
Overall, in the currently ongoing Phase 2 study with SEL -212, SUA levels have remained 
consistently below 6 mg/dL in 70% to 89% of evaluable Part A patients administered SEL -212 
once  month ly for 3 months.  Similarly,  in Part C where  SEL-212 was administered  once monthly 
for 5 months, SUA levels have remained below 6 mg/dL in 61% to 75% of evaluable patients 
through the end of  the fifth treatment period.  All evaluable Part C patients  who had SUA  levels 
below 6 mg/dL at week 12 also had SUA below 6 mg/dL at Week 24. The control of SUA has 
occurred in the context of low incidences of infusion reactions, anaphylaxis, and gout flares as 
well as treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) known t o be potentially associated with 
sirolimus (Rapamune®). Data support a once monthly dosing regimen.  
7.6.4 Rationale  for the Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint  
The incidence of gout increases as circulating uric acid levels increase ( Campion 1987 ) and 
lowering  circulating  urate  levels  is a primary  means  of managing  gout.  The American  College  of 
Rheumatology recommends lowering urate levels to a target of less than 6 mg/dL at minimum 
(Khanna 2012a ) to improve the signs and symptoms of gout.  
Based on a proposed indication of treatment of chronic gout refractory to conventional therapy, 
the objectives  of this study  design  are to assess  the reduction  in SUA  in cohorts  of adult  subjects 
treated with SEL -212 compared to KRYSTEXXA. The proposed primary endpoint is  
PROPRIETARY AND  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE  36 OF 84  
  STUDY : SEL-212/202 
VERSION : 3.0 EFFECTIVE  DATE  
08 JUN 2020  
  
comparison in the percentage of patients on SEL -212 vs. KRYSTEXXA who achieve and 
maintain  reduction  of SUA <  6 mg/dL  for at least 80% of the time during  Treatment  Period 3  and 
Treatment Period 6.  
7.6.5 Rationale  for Secondary  Efficacy  Endpoints  
Secondary  endpoints  were  selected  based  on symptoms  of chronic  gout as well as quality  of life 
as a consequence of chronic gout. Patients  with severe, chronic gout are often refractory to oral 
therapies and often present with swollen or tender joints. Exacerbation of gout (flare) and joint 
tenderness and swelling impact a patients’ ability to maintain physical activity and functioni ng 
and correspond to quality of life. Several instruments will be used to assess quality of life and 
will include patient -reported outcomes, provider -reported assessments, and generalized 
assessments of overall quality of life.  
7.7 Benefits  and Risks  
Chronic gout refractory to conventional therapy is a rare and serious condition associated with 
increased mortality rate and significantly decreased quality of life and for which there are very 
limited  treatment  options.  Data  from  the Phase  2 study SEL -212/201 provide  preliminary  clinical 
evidence demonstrating that SEL -212 is a substantial improvement over available therapy:  
• Substantially  increased  percentage  of patients  that maintain  control  of SUA  while  on 
therapy  
• Substantially  reduced  gout flare rate during  therapy  
• Substantially  reduced  risk of infusion  reactions  
• More  convenient  to and greater  compliance  by patients  because  of once  monthly  therapy  
• Acceptable  safety  at the doses  to be studied  in this Phase  2 study  
SEL-212 has the potential  to be an unprecedented  safe and effective  treatment  option  for patients 
for which  other  treatment  options  are inadequate. The overall  balance between  benefits  and risks 
appears  acceptable for the SEL -202/202 study of SEL -212 in the  intended population of patients 
with chronic gout refractory to conventional therapy.

8.2.1 Patient  Completion  and Withdrawal  Criteria  
8.2.1.1  Screen Failures  
A patient is considered enrolled in the study at the time of ICF signature. Any patient that is 
screened but not dosed will be considered a screen failure and the reason for failure will be 
documented.  Within  the 45-day screening  window,  out-of-range  laboratory  tests may be repeated 
up to 2 times before declaring a scre en failure. After the 45 -day screening window, patients can 
be re -screened once.  
8.2.1.2  Patient  Completion  
A patient will be considered to have completed  the study when the patient has completed Safety 
Follow -up that occurs 30 (+ 4) days after the final dose of s tudy drug. Enrolled patients who 
prematurely  discontinue  for any reason  before  completion  of the study  will be treated as  outlined 
below in Section 8.2.1.3.1 . 
8.2.1.3  Enrolled  Patient  Withdrawal  and Discontinuations  
8.2.1.3.1  Withdrawal  Procedures  
Early termination from the study occurs when an enrolled patient withdraws consent or the 
Investigator  terminates  a patient.  The reason  for withdrawal  will be evaluated  and recorded  in the 
case report f orm (CRF) and source documents. Patients that withdraw will not be replaced.  
Patients  may withdraw  consent  at any time. Reason(s)  for withdrawal  of consent,  failure  to return 
for the necessary visits, or termination from the study should be documented. All patients that 
withdraw early from the study, upon termination should have the Early Termination visit  
PROPRIETARY AND  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE  40 OF 84  
  STUDY : SEL-212/202

assessments  completed  (i.e., End of Study  assessments)  (Section  20), if the assessments  pose no 
risk to the patient and the patient allows such assessments.  
The Investigator should consult with the Sponsor/medical monitor prior to withdrawing any 
patient from the study. Since  this is a multiple -dose study, once dosed, patients generally should 
not be terminated by the Investigator and should be followed through the end of Treatment 
Period 6, unless the patient withdraws consent or is lost to follow -up. In situations where 
continued  participation  in certain  aspects  of the study  pose a risk to the patient,  with consultation 
with the medical monitor, the Investigator should discontinue those procedures that pose a risk 
and should continue to collect data and conduct those assessments that do not put the patient at 
risk through the end of Treatment Period 6. Patients with compliance issues or major deviations 
that effect data quality will also continue to be followed through the end of Treatment Period 6 
collecting as much d ata on the patient as possible, unless otherwise indicated by the Sponsor.  
8.2.1.3.2  Patients  Lost To Follow -Up 
For patients to be considered as lost to follow -up, at least 3 contact attempts must be 
documented,  of which  the last must  be a letter  sent by a service  that requires  a delivery  signature 
record (e.g., US Postal Service certified letter or Federal Express/UPS letter that requires 
signature of delivery). If the letter is undeliverable or no response is received within  7 days, the 
patient will be considered t erminated due to lost to follow -up.

10. STUDY  DRUG  MATERIALS  AND  MANAGEMENT  
10.1 Study  Drug  
This is a randomized, open -label  treatment study.  The designated  site representative  will prepare 
study drug on the day of treatment. Prior to study drug administration in T reatment Periods 2 
through 6, the Investigator will determine a patient’s eligibility for  treatment with study drug by 
evaluating  the patient’s  SUA  level  measured  from  the blood  sample  obtained  from Day  21 of the 
most recently completed Treatment Period (SEL -212 cohort) or from the previous 2 
measurements (KRYSTEXXA cohort).  
10.1.1  SEL -212 
SEL-212 is comprised  of 2 components: SEL -037 and SEL-110.36.  Refer  to Section  9.1 for 
complete descrip tions of the components.  
The dose level  to be investigated  in this study  will be: 
 
• SEL-212: consisting  of 0.15  mg/kg  SEL-110.36  and 0.2  mg/kg  SEL-037 
10.1.2  KRYSTEXXA  
KRYSTEXXA  (pegloticase  injection)  will consist  of commercially  available  study  drug. 
The dose level to be investigated in this study will be:  
• KRYSTEXXA:  8 mg (uricase  protein)  (KRYSTEXXA  Prescribing  Information  2018 ) 
10.2 Study  Drug  Packaging  and Labeling  
SEL-212 will be supplied  in vials  in individual  cartons  with cartons  and vials  unassigned  to a 
patient. KRYSTEXXA will be packaged according to the manufacturer’s specifications.  
10.3 Study  Drug  Storage  
Upon  receipt  of the SEL -037 vials  at the clinical  site, the vials should  be stored  in a secured  way 
at 2°C to 8°C within the primary or secondary box container in order to protect the SEL -037 
from long -term light exposure.  
Upon  receipt  of the SEL-110.36  vials  at the clinical  site, the vials  should  be stored  in a secured 
way at 2°C to 8°C within the primary or secondary box container in order to protect the  
SEL-110.36  from long -term light exposure.  
 
KRYSTEXXA  will be handled  and stored  according  to the manufacturer’s  currently  approved 
labeling ( KRYSTEXXA Prescribing Information 2018 ). 
10.4 Study  Drug  Preparation  
Doses  of SEL-212 are calculated  on a mg/kg  basis  according  to a patient’s  weight.  For Treatment 
Period 1, the patient’s Screening weight will be used for dose preparation. For the remaining

Treatment Periods,  the patient’s  weight  at the Day 21 visit from  the preceding Treatment  Period 
will be used for dose calculation. Detailed procedures and examples of dose calculations and 
study drug preparation are provided in the Study Operations Manual.  
10.4.1  SEL -037 Preparation  
Each vial of SEL -037 will be reconstituted with 6.9 mL of sterile water for inj ection, USP 
(United States Pharmacopeia or equivalent) which forms a 6 mg/mL concentrated solution and 
then the appropriate  dose diluted  for administration  in 100 mL of room  temperature  0.9%  sodium 
chloride for injection, USP. The full resultant  volume of the SEL -037-normal saline solution  
(100 mL saline + required volume of reconstituted SEL -037 + saline bag  manufacturing overfill) 
will be administered in the allotted time. Reconstituted SEL -037 is stable at room temperature  
for 18 hours and the  diluted SEL -037-normal saline solution for infusing should be used (i.e., 
infusion completed) within 6 hours of dilution. If not administered immediately, store 
refrigerated. The SEL -037 dose administration must be completed within 12 hours  of the start o f 
reconstitution.  
10.4.2  SEL -110.36  Preparation  
Each vial of SEL -110.36 will be reconstituted with 4.9 mL of sterile water for injection, USP 
(United States Pharmacopeia or equivalent) which forms a 2 mg/mL suspension before being 
drawn  into appropriate  size syringe/syringes  for IV infusion  with syringe  pump. Reconstituted 
SEL-110.36  is stable  for 24 hours  at room  temperature  at normal  light conditions.  SEL-110.36 
should be administered on the same day and as soon as possible after reconstitution. If not 
administe red immediately, store refrigerated. The SEL -110.36 dose must be completely 
administered within 12 hours of the start of reconstitution.  
10.4.3  KRYSTEXXA  Preparation  
Doses  of KRYSTEXXA  will be calculated  and prepared  based  on the manufacturer’s  currently 
approved labeling ( KRYSTEXXA Prescribing Information 2018 ). 
Under appropriate aseptic technique, 1 mL of KRYSTEXXA will be withdrawn from the vial 
and injected into a single 250 mL bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 0.45% 
Sodium  Chloride  Injection  USP for IV infusion.  The solution  will not be mixed  or diluted  with 
other drugs. Thorough mixing will be by inversion, not shaking. The diluted solution may be 
kept for 4 hours  at 2°C t o 8°C (36°F  to 46°F) and at room temperature (20°C to 25°C, 68°F  to 
77°F). It is recommended that diluted solutions be stored under refrigeration, not frozen, 
protected from light, and used within 4 hours of dilution.  
Detailed  procedures  for study  drug preparation  are provided  in the Study  Operations  Manual.

10.5 Premedication  
10.5.1  Gout  Flares  (Prevention  and Treatment)  
All patients  that meet  all inclusion  and exclusion  criteria  will be premedicated  for gout flare 
prevention.  The regimen  will begin  at least 7  days prior  to the first dosing  of study  drug and 
continue for as long as the patient is participating in the clinical study.  
Patients not already taking colchicine will receive colchicine 1.2 mg as a single loading dose 
followed by 0.6 mg QD for  the remainder of participation in the trial. If the patient cannot 
tolerate  the loading  dose level  of 1.2 mg, then the patient  will initiate  and maintain  colchicine  at 
0.6 mg. Patients with a documented medical reason that describes a contraindication to 
colchicine will receive ibuprofen 600 mg TID or an equivalent NSAID unless the patient has a 
contraindication  to NSAID. At  the discretion  of the Investigator,  a proton  pump  inhibitor  may be 
prescribed with the NSAID as gastric prophylaxis. Patients with documented medical reasons 
that describe  contraindications  to both colchicine and NSAIDs  will receive no premedication for 
gout flare.  
Patients who began receiving a NSAID as gout flare prevention medication due to a 
contraindication  to colchicine  should continue  to receive  the NSAID  during  study  participation. 
These medications will be supplied by the clinic.  
As gout flares  are expected to occur despite preventative premedication, incidents  of gout flare 
are to be recorded  as an AE and treated  at the discretion  of the Investigator  to provide  adequate 
patient care.  
10.5.2  Premedication  with  Antihistamines  and Steroids  
All patients  in the study  will be pre-medicated  with oral antihistamines  and steroids  as follows 
for prevention of infusion reactions:  
• Prednisone  (40 mg) orally  approximately  24 (± 12) hours  prior  to dosing  (morning  before 
study drug dosing on Day 0)  
• Fexofenadine  (180 mg) orally  approximately  12 (± 2) hours  prior  to dosing  (evening 
before study drug dosing on Day 0)  
• Fexofenadine  (180 mg) orally  approximately  2 (± 1) hours  prior  to dosing  (day of study 
drug dosing)  
• Methylprednisolone (40  mg) (or equivalent)  IV approximately  1 (± 0.5) hours  prior  to 
dosing (day of study drug dosing)  
 
Refer  to Section  12.2.1.5  for guidance  on reducing  the risk of infusion  reactions  and for 
managing infusion reactions.

10.6 Administration  
10.6.1  SEL -212 
Before  administration  of SEL-212, patients  will be premedicated  with antihistamines and 
steroids as described in Section 10.5. 
Patients  will receive  treatment  with SEL -212 on Day 0 of each Treatment Period  for a total of 
6 doses of study drug.  
All study  drugs  should  be administered  through  the same  IV access.  All blood  samples  should  be 
drawn f rom an alternative venous access.  
If an infusion reaction occurs, Investigators are permitted to use concomitant medications or 
treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate patient care. Investigators should also utilize 
the infusion reaction lab kit pr ovided in  the Study Operations Manual to collect  additional blood 
specimens. In the case of a Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions occurring during an infusion, the 
administration  of study  drug should  be immediately  discontinued,  and the affected patient  should 
be treated according to the clinical trial site’s protocol for infusion reactions (e.g., monitoring, 
administration of antihistamines, corticosteroids, fluids and epinephrine, as clinically indicated).  
The reconstituted SEL -110.36 will be withdrawn from the vial  and dosed via IV infusion with a 
syringe infusion pump utilizing an appropriately sized syringe. SEL -110.36 will be infused at a 
rate of 3.0 mL/hr for the first 30 minutes, then a rate adequate to deliver the remaining dose 
volume over a peri od of 60 minutes concurrently with 125 mL normal saline. Following the 
infusion of SEL -110.36, the  main IV  line must be flushed with normal saline prior to the start of 
the SEL-037 infusion.  Refer  to the Study  Operations  Manual  for instructions  regarding  infusions 
for patients with medical history involving cardiovascular comorbidities.  
SEL-037 infusion will start within 15 minutes after completion of the SEL -110.36 infusion. 
SEL-037 will be infused  via infusion  pump  over a time period  of no less than 120 minutes.  If an 
infusion reaction occurs during the administration of SEL -037, the infusion may be slowed, or  
stopped  and restarted  at a slower  rate at the discretion  of the physician. Following  the infusion  of 
SEL-037, the main IV line must be flushed with normal saline.  
The Investigator is permitted  to modify  the infusion parameters (decrease the rate of  infusion or 
interrupt  the infusion)  ONLY  if medically  warranted  in response  to an AE. The Investigator  will 
notify the unblinded medical monitor of any changes in infusion parameters. Detailed 
instructions  for modifying the infusion parameters  are included in the Study Operations  Manual.  
10.6.2  KRYSTEXXA  
Before  administration  of KRYSTEXXA,  patients  will be premedicated  with antihistamines  and

temperature, but never exposed to artificial heating (eg, hot water, microwave). The diluted 
solution  of KRYSTEXXA  should  be administered  by IV infusion  via gravity  feed,  syringe -type 
pump, or infusion pump over no less than 120 minutes. Following the infusion of 
KRYSTEXXA, the main IV line must be flushed with normal saline.  
If an infusion reaction occurs, Investigators are permitted to use concomitant medications or 
treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate patient care. Investigators should als o utilize 
the infusion reaction lab kit provided in  the Study Operations Manual to collect  additional blood 
specimens. In the case of a Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions occurring during an infusion, the 
administration  of study  drug should  be immediately  discontinued,  and the affected  patient  should 
be treated according to the clinical trial site’s protocol for infusion reactions (e.g., monitoring, 
administration of antihistamines, corticosteroids, fluids and epinephrine, as clinically indicated).  
10.7 Study  Drug  Accountability  
Study drug will only be used as directed in the protocol. Study personnel will account for all 
vials  of study drugs  received, dispensed, and used for each patient, and vials  returned. The date 
and time of reconstitution and dilution will be recorded. Used vials should be traceable back  to 
the patient.  The Investigator  is responsible  for the study  drug accountability,  reconciliation,  and 
record maintenance. Refer to the Study Operations Manual for additional instructions.

The HAQ -DI will be administered  according  to the schedules  described  in Section  20. 
 
The HAQ -DI, which includes the patient  global assessment  and pain scale, is an instrument  that 
assesses  fine movements  of the upper  extremity,  locomotor  activities  of the lower  extremity,  and 
activities that involve both the upper and  lower extremities. Standard scoring takes into account 
the use of aids  and devices  or assistance from another person. There are 20  items  in 8 categories 
that represent a comprehensive set of functio nal activities: dressing, rising, eating, walking, 
hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. The stem of each item assesses a patient’s functional 
ability using their usual equipment during the past week. Each category contains at least 2 
specific sub -category questions. For example, under the category “walking,” patients are asked 
about their ability to walk outdoors on flat ground and to climb up 5 steps.  
11.3.2  Provider  Global  Assessment  of Disease  Activity  
The Provider  Global  Assessment  of Disease  Activity  (PrGA)  will be conducted  according  to the 
schedules described in Section 20. The PrGA will be administered to assess the severity of the

Lower scores indicate less severe disease.  
11.3.3  Short  Form Health  Survey 36  (SF-36) 
The SF-36 will be administered  according  to the schedules  described  in Section 20. 
 
The SF -36 is a 36-item scale constructed  to survey  health  status  and quality  of life ( Ware 1992 ). 
The SF -36 assesses 8 health concepts: limitations in physical activities because of health 
problems; limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems; limitations 
in usual role activities beca use of physical health problems; bodily pain; general mental health 
(psychological distress and well -being); limitations in usual role activities because of emotional 
problems;  vitality  (energy  and fatigue);  and general  health  perceptions.  The standard  form of the 
instruments asks for patients to reply to questions according to how they have felt over the 
previous week.

Female partners of male patients who are of childbearing potential are required to practice an 
acceptable form of birth control to  continue in the study  and for 30 days  after the last  study drug 
administration. Male patients of reproductive potential who are having intercourse with female 
partners  of childbearing  potential  must  agree  to use 2 forms  of contraception,  1 of which  must  be 
a barrier method, during the study and for 90 days after the last study drug administration.  
Acceptable  barrier  methods  include  a condom  and diaphragm.  Acceptable  forms  of birth  control 
for female partners of childbearing potential are non -hormonal and hormonal intrauterine 
devices, hormonal birth control pills, hormonal birth control patches, hormonal birth control 
injections, hormonal birth control implants. Spermicide used alone is not an acceptable method 
and must  be used with another  acceptable  form  birth control  method. Abstinence  is acceptable  if 
consistent with the patient’s nor mal lifestyle.  
If a patient  becomes  pregnant  after she begins  taking  study  drug,  the procedures  in 
Section 12.2.2.7  should be followed.  
12.1.8.9  Definition  of Childbearing  Potential  and Acceptable  Contraceptive  Methods 
A woman is considered of childbearing potential (i.e., fertile), following menarche and until 
becoming post-menopausal unless  permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods  include 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.  
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for > 24 months without an alternative medical 
cause.  A high follicle  stimulating  hormone  (FSH)  level  in the postmenopausal  range  may be used 
to confirm a post -menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal 
replacement therapy. However, in the absence of > 24 months of amenorrhea, one conf irmatory 
FSH measurement must be obtained or documented.  
For female  partners  of childbearing  potential,  the following  methods  of contraception,  when  used 
consistently and correctly, are considered reliable for participation in the study:

12.1.9  Premedication  Regimen  
Refer  to Section  10.5 for procedures  about  premedication  regimens  to prevent  infusion 
associated reactions and gout flare.  
12.2 Adverse  and Serious  Adverse  Events  
12.2.1  Definition  of Adverse Events  
Definitions  in this section  are in accordance with  21 CFR 312.32.  
 
12.2.1.1  Adverse  Event  (AE)  
An AE is any untoward  medical  occurrence  associated  with the use of a drug (i.e., study  drug)  in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a drug and does not imply any judgment about causality. An AE can 
arise  with use of any drug or medicinal  product. A  treatment -emergent  AE (TEAE)  is an AE that 
starts o r worsens at any time after initiation of study drug on Day 0 of Treatment Period 1 until 
the End of Study Visit (30 days after completion of the last dose of study drug).  
Patients will be considered enrolled in the study upon signing the ICF. During the S creening 
Phase (from time informed consent is signed to immediately before dosing) any clinically 
significant changes in the patient’s health will be recorded in the patient’s medical history and 
will not be considered  as AEs.  AEs will be collected  from  the time the patient is  dosed  (infusion 
is started) until the end of the End of Study Visit. SAEs will be collected from the time the 
patient signs informed consent until the End of Study Visit.  
12.2.1.2  Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  
An SAE  is any AE that occurs  irrespective  of study  treatment  assignment,  if it satisfies  any of 
these criteria:  
• Results  in death;  
• Is life -threatening;  
• Requires  inpatient  hospitalization  ≥ 24 hours  or prolongs  existing  hospitalization;  
• Results  in persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions;  
• Is a congenital  anomaly or birth defect;  
• Is an important medical event that, based  upon appropriate medical judgment,  may 
jeopardize the  patient  or patient  and may require  medical  or surgical  intervention  to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
 
12.2.1.3  Suspected  Adverse  Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is an AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused  the AE. For the purposes  of IND safety  reporting,  “reasonable  possibility”  means  there  is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. Suspected adverse  
PROPRIETARY AND  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE  54 OF 84  
  STUDY : SEL-212/202 
VERSION : 3.0 EFFECTIVE  DATE  
08 JUN 2020  
  
reaction  implies  a lesser  degree  of certainty  about  causality  than adverse  reaction,  which  means 
any AE caused by a drug.  
12.2.1.4  Unexpected  Adverse  Events  and Unexpected  Suspected  Drug  Reaction  
An AE or suspected  adverse  reaction  (an AE where  there  is a reasonable  possibility  that the  drug 
caused the event; suspected drug related) is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the  
SEL-212 Investigator’s  Brochure  or is not listed  at the specificity  or severity  that has been 
observed.  
12.2.1.5  Infusion  Reactions  / Adverse  Events  of Special  Interest  
A study drug -related AE that occurs within 24 hours after initiation of study drug infusion will 
be assessed as an infusion reaction. An infusion reaction suspected to be anaphylaxis will be 
assessed  according  to the clinical  criteria  for the diagnosis  of anaphylaxis  based  on the National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) / Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network 
(FAAN) Symposium criteria ( Sampson 2006 ). 
Infusion reactions will be managed and  treated as desc ribed below. In addition to premedication 
with antihistamines  and steroids  (Section  10.5.2 ), the following  steps  will be implemented  in this 
protocol to either reduce the risk of infusion reactions or manage infusion reactions.  
• Patients  with immunoreactivity  to PEG will be ineligible  for the study  
• Patients  with prior  exposure  to uricase  therapy  will be ineligible  
• Patients  with a history  of anaphylaxis  or severe  allergic  reactions,  angioedema,  or 
previous infusion reactions will be excluded from the trial.  
• Study  drug will be administered  at controlled  rates  only in a healthcare  setting  and by 
healthcare providers  sufficiently  equipped  and prepared to  manage  infusion  reactions 
including anaphylaxis.  
• In case of infusion  reaction,  sites will perform  specific  assessments  as specified in  the 
Study Operations Manual.  
• Each  patient  will be observed  for infusion  reactions  after dosing  of study  drug in the 
clinic for approximately 1 hour  after the end of study drug infusion. Patients  will be 
informed  about  the signs  or symptoms  of infusion  reactions  and will be instructed  to 
notify the Investigator immediately if they believe they are experiencing a reaction.  
• Each  patient  shall remain  for a minimum  of 1 hour after the completion  of infusion  of 
study drug for a period of safety observation.  
• Only sites with immediate  capability  to appropriately  respond  to a reaction  of this 
severity will be allowed to participate  in the trial to reduce  the risk to  any patient.  
 
Adverse  events  of special  interest  (AESI)  will be recorded  specifically  for occurrences  of: gout 
flares,  infections,  viral infections,  interstitial  lung disease,  stomatitis,  infusion -related  reactions 
including anaphylaxis, malignancies, renal failure; and the following lab tests, if deemed  
PROPRIETARY AND  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE  55 OF 84  
  STUDY : SEL-212/202 
VERSION : 3.0 EFFECTIVE  DATE  
08 JUN 2020  
  
clinically  significant  by the PI: hyperlipidemia,  worsening  of renal  function  tests,  proteinuria, 
and leukopenia.  
12.2.2  Recording  Adverse  Events  
Patients will be encouraged to spontaneously report any changes in health from the time of 
signing  the ICF through  completion  of the study.  Study  staff will also inquire  about  any changes 
in the patient’s health.  
All AEs will be recorded  in the source  document  and the CRF.  It is the responsibility  of the 
Investigator to review all documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory, and 
diagnostics reports) for the presence of AEs and for a complete evaluation of known AEs.  
At minimum for each AE, the Investigator will evaluate and report the event 
name/term/description,  onset  (date  and time),  resolution  (date  and time),  event severity/intensity, 
relationship  to study  drug,  action  taken in  regard  to study  drug,  whether  the event  is an SAE,  and 
whether or not it caused the patient to discontinue the study. The event time is only required 
while the patient is in the clinic.  
During the Screening Phase (from time informed consent is signed to immediately before 
dosing)  any clinically  significant  changes  in the patient’s  health  will be recorded  in the patient’s 
medical history and will not be considered as AEs.  
12.2.2.1  Adverse  Event  Term/Name/Description  
The Investigator  will attempt  to establish  a diagnosis  of each AE based  on signs,  symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis will be the AE term used to 
document the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/ symptoms.  
12.2.2.2  Relationship  to Study  Drug  
The Investigator is obligated to  assess the relationship between study drug and  the occurrence of 
each AE. The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative 
causes,  such as natural  history  of the underlying  diseases,  concomitant  therapy,  other  risk factors, 
and the temporal relationship of the event to the study drug will be considered and investigated. 
The Investigator will also consult the SEL -212 Investigator’s Brochure and/or Product 
Information for marketed products in the determination of his/her assessment.  
The Investigator  will assess  causality  as to whether  the event  is related  or not related  to study 
drug based on the following definitions:  
• Not Related:  If no valid  reason  exists  for suggesting  a relationship  to study  drug or the 
AE was more likely explained by causes other than study drug.  
• Unlikely  to be Related:  Onset  of the event  has a reasonable  temporal  relationship  to study 
drug administration and although a causal relationship is unlikely, it is biologically 
plausible.  
PROPRIETARY AND  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE  56 OF 84  
  STUDY : SEL-212/202 
VERSION : 3.0 EFFECTIVE  DATE  
08 JUN 2020  
  
• Possibly  Related:  Onset  of the event  has a strong  temporal  relationship  to administration 
of the study drug and a causal relationship is biologically plausible  
• Related: The study drug dosing and AE were closely related in time and the AE may be 
explained  by exposure  to study  product:  e.g., known  pharmacological  effect  or recurrence 
on re -challenge.  
 
There may be situations, particularly when an SAE has occurred, where the Investigator has 
minimal information to make an assessment in an initial SAE report. However, it is very 
important that the Investigator always makes an assessment of causality for e very SAE prior to 
transmission  of the SAE  report.  The Investigator  may change  his/her  opinion  of causality  in light 
of follow -up information, amending the SAE report accordingly. Any assessment of causality 
made by the Investigator should also be documente d in the patient’s source medical record.  
12.2.2.3  Adverse  Event  Intensity/Severity  Grading  
AEs will be classified  according  to the Rheumatology  Common  Toxicity  Criteria,  version  2.0 
(Woodworth 2007 ). Additional details of the criteria can be found in the study operations 
manual.  
• Grade 1 (mild): AE that is usually  transient of short duration; or involves mild or minor 
symptoms which are of marginal clinical relevanc e; or is asymptomatic consisting of 
clinical  or diagnostic  observations  alone;  no intervention  or only minimal  treatment  with 
non-prescription intervention was required. The event does not generally interfere with 
usual activities of daily living.  
• Grade 2 (moderate): AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living (e.g., shopping, 
laundry,  transportation,  or ability  to conduct  finances),  causing  discomfort  but poses  no 
significant or permanent risk or harm to the patient.  
• Grade  3 (severe):  AE that is medically  significant/important  but not life-threatening;  may 
require brief hospitalization to prevent the event from worsening; interrupts usual 
activities of dail y living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive 
therapeutic intervention.  
• Grade 4 (life -threatening): An AE, and/or its immediate sequelae, which is associated 
with an imminent  risk of death  or which  is associated  with physical  or mental  disabilities 
that affect or limit the ability of a person to perform activities of daily living (eating, 
ambulation, toileting, etc.); disability may  be persistent or result in significant disability, 
incapacity or limitation of self -care activi ties. 
 
For an assessment  of anaphylaxis,  the clinical  criteria  for the diagnosis  of anaphylaxis  will be 
based on the NIAID/FAAN Symposium criteria ( Sampson 2006 ). 
12.2.2.4  Assessment  of Outcome  
The result  or conclusion  of the AE will  be assessed  and recorded  by the Investigator  as: 
• Fatal  
PROPRIETARY AND  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE  57 OF 84  
  STUDY : SEL-212/202 
VERSION : 3.0 EFFECTIVE  DATE  
08 JUN 2020  
  
• Not recovered/not  resolved  (the AE has not improved  or patient  has not recuperated).  
• Recovered/resolved  (the AE  has improved  or patient  has recuperated)  
• Recovered/resolved  with sequelae  (recuperated  but retained  pathological  conditions 
resulting from the AE)  
• Recovering/resolving  (the patient is  improving  but the AE has not yet resolved)  
• Unknown  (not known,  not observed, not  recorded, or refused)  
12.2.2.5  Action  Taken  with Study  Drug  
The action  taken with  reference  to study  drug will be assessed  by the investigator  as: 
• Dose not  changed  (dose  completed)  
• Dose  interrupted  (IV infusion  was temporally  modified  by temporarily  stopping  the 
infusion; slowing of the rate of infusion should also be classified as interrupted)  
• Drug  withdrawn  (IV infusion  was modified  through  termination  of the infusion)  
A response  option  for increasing or  decreasing  the dose is not an  available  course  of action  in 
this study.  
12.2.2.6  Laboratory  and Diagnostic  Abnormalities  as Adverse  Events  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal diagnostic assessments 
(e.g.,  ECGs,  vital signs)  that are detected  in dosed patients  or that significantly  worsen  relative  to 
baseline in dosed patients will be reported as AEs. Clinical significance is based on the 
Investigator’s  judgment  but will typically  include  findings  that results  in study  withdrawal,  result 
in active management of the patient, or are associated with clinical signs and symptoms. Since 
the study requires patients with elevated or abnormal SUA levels, abnormal SUA levels will 
typically not be an AE unless judged by the I nvestigator as being more severe than expected for 
the patient.  
12.2.2.7  Pregnancy  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE, any pregnancy complication or elective 
termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE and followed. Th e 
outcome  of all pregnancies  must  be followed  up and documented  even  if the patient is  no longer 
a study patient.  
The Investigator, or his/her designee, will collect pregnancy information on every female who 
becomes  pregnant  while  enrolled  in this study  and on every  female  partner  of a male patient  who 
becomes  pregnant while the male partner is  enrolled in  this study. The Investigator  will report  to 
the Sponsor  or Sponsor’s  designee within  24 hours  of learning  of a patient’s  or female partner  of 
a patient’s pregnancy. In the case of a female partner of a male patient enrolled in the study 
becoming pregnant while the male patient is enrolled in this study, a separate pregnancy partner 
informed consent form will be completed by the patient’s partner. The patient or female partner  
PROPRIETARY AND  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE  58 OF 84  
  STUDY : SEL-212/202 
VERSION : 3.0 EFFECTIVE  DATE  
08 JUN 2020  
  
of a patient  must  also be followed  to determine  the outcome  of the pregnancy.  Information  on the 
status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor or Sponsor Designee, as 
appropriate. Follow -up on the child will be to the first well -child visit. Any premature 
termination of the pregnancy will be reported.  
A spontaneous abortion or congenital abnormalities/birth defects will be considered SAEs and 
will be reported as such. Furthermore, any SAE occurr ing as a result of a post -study pregnancy 
and is considered  reasonably related  to the study  drug by the Investigator,  will be reported  to the 
Sponsor.  
12.2.3  Reporting  Adverse  Events  
12.2.3.1  Adverse  Event  Reporting  Period  
The study period during which AEs must be reported is from the time the patient is dosed until 
the 30 days after the last infusion  of study  drug.  During  the Screening  Phase  (from  time informed 
consent is signed up to the time of dosing) any clinically significant changes in the patient’s 
health wi ll be recorded in the patient’s medical history and will not be considered as AEs.  
Investigators  are not obligated  to actively  seek AEs or SAEs  in former  study patients.  However, 
if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patient has been 
discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study drug, 
the Investigator should promptly notify the Sponsor.  
12.2.3.2  SAE  Reporting  Procedures  
If SAEs occur, all Investigators should immediately, but not later than 24 hours of observing or 
learning  of the event,  complete  and fax the SAE form to Syneos  Health  and Pharmacovigilance.  
Facsimile  (for SAE only):   
 
Email  (for SAE only):   
 
The Investigator  will complete  the SAE  form  and provide  all case information  available  at the 
time of the initial report. The inves tigator must include the following mandatory case 
information:  
1. The patient  identification  number  
2. The event description  
3. The seriousness  criteria  
4. The Investigator’s  causality  assessment  
 
The reporting  Investigator  must  send the written  and signed  SAE  report  by facsimile  or email, 
within 24 hours of observing, notification of, or learning of the SAE to Syneos Health and 
Pharmacovigilance as described above. Follow -up information regarding an SAE and the 
supporting data, including laboratory findings and  discharge summaries, should be sent by  

PROPRIETARY AND  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE  59 OF 84  
  STUDY : SEL-212/202 
VERSION : 3.0 EFFECTIVE  DATE  
08 JUN 2020  
  
facsimile  or email  to Syneos  Health  and Pharmacovigilance within  24 hours  of receipt  of the 
information.  
If the Investigator  does not have  all information  regarding  an SAE,  the Investigator  will not wait 
to receive additional information before completing as much of the form as possible and 
notifying the safety group. The form will be updated when additional information is received.  
The Investigator  will always  provide  at minimum:  1) AE term or event  name/description,  
2) patient  identifier,  3) an assessment  of causality  (Section 12.2.2.2 ). 
 
12.2.3.3  Regulatory  Reporting  Requirements  for SAEs  
The Sponsor or Sponsor representative will report fatal or life -threatening SAEs that are 
unexpected suspected adverse reactions to  the relevant regulatory authorities within  7 calendar 
days, and non -fatal or life -threatening SAEs that are unexpected suspected adverse reactions 
within  15 calendar  days as Investigational  New  Drug  (IND) Safety  Reports,  in accordance  with 
21 CFR 312.32. Prompt notification of SAEs by the Investigator to the appropriate project 
contact  for SAE  receipt  is essential  so that legal  obligations  and ethical  responsibilities  towards 
the safety of other patients are met.  
12.2.3.4  Reporting  Safety  Information  to the IRB/IEC  
The Investigator,  or responsible  person  according  to local  requirements,  will comply  with the 
applicable local regulatory requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to the Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC).  
All Investigators involved in studies with this drug will receive a copy of each IND Safety 
Report.  When  an Investigator  receives  an IND Safety  Report or other  safety  information  (e.g., 
revised Clinical Investigator’s Brochure/Investigator’s Brochure), the responsible person 
according to local requirements is required to promptly notify his or her IRB.  
12.2.4  Follow -up of Adverse  Events  
The Investigator  is required  to proactively  follow  each patient  and provide  further  information  in 
regards  to AEs and SAEs.  All AEs and SAEs  will be followed until  30 days after the last dose of 
study drug, resolution of the event, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise 
explained, or until the patient is lost to follow -up, whichever occurs earlier. Once resolved, the 
appropriate CRF entries and event reporting forms will be updated, as appropriate.  
All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact  and designated as ongoing will be 
reviewed  at subsequent  visits/contacts.  The Investigator  will ensure  that follow -up includes  any 
supplemental investigations as may be indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the 
AE or SAE. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.  
PROPRIETARY AND  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE  60 OF 84

The Sponsor  or the Sponsor’s  designee  may request  that the Investigator  perform  or arrange  for 
the conduct o f supplemental measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible 
the nature and/or  causality  of the AE or SAE.  The Investigator  is obligated  to assist.  If a patient 
dies during participation  in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, the Sponsor will 
be provided with a copy of any post -mortem findings, including histopathology.  
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE forms, with all 
changes  signed  and dated  by the Investigator.  This information  will also be entered  into the CRF.

13. STATISTICS  
Details  of the statistical  methods  outlined in  the protocol  for this study,  including  the hierarchical 
ordering  of the secondary  endpoints,  will be documented  in a Statistical  Analysis  Plan (SAP) that 
will be finalized prior to first patient randomized. The SAP may add additional exploratory 
analyses; modifications to the planned analyses will be identified as such in the SAP.  
13.1 Sample  Size Determination  
The primary ef ficacy criterion in this study is defined as the percentage of subjects who achieve 
and maintain  reduction  of SUA  < 6 mg/dL  for at least 80% of the time during  Treatment  Period  3 
and Treatment Period 6.  
The percentage  of responders  according  to the above  criterion  is assumed  to be 65% in the 
SEL-212 arm and 44% in the KRYSTEXXA arm.  
Using the Chi -square test for comparison  between the SEL -212 arm and  the KRYSTEXXA arm, 
and considering  a one-sided  alpha=5%  and the statistical  power  of 80%,  results  in 69 subjects  per 
treatment group. Taking into account that some subjects may be excluded from the modified 
Intent -to-Treat (mITT) analyses ( Section 13.2.4 ), 75 subjects per treatment group will be 
randomized. For the sample size estimation, Chi -square test, instead of the Cochran -Mantel - 
Haenszel test, is used although the randomization will be stratified for tophus presen ce (yes/no) 
as there is  no valid assumption of the distribution of this  stratification variable within the eligible 
subject population.  
Sample  size calculations  were  performed  with the software  package  nQuery  Advisor®  Sample 
Size Calculator V. 8.2.1.0.  
13.2 Analysis Populations  
13.2.1  Screened  / Randomized  Set 
The Screened  Set will include  all patients  who signed  an informed  consent.  The Randomized  Set 
will include all patients randomized.  
13.2.2  Safety  Set (SS) 
The Safety Set will include all patients who were administered any amount of study medication. 
Patients  will be analyzed  according  to treatment  received.  The SS will be used for all analyses  of 
safety endpoints and for the presentation of patients in all patient listings.  
13.2.3  Intent -to-Treat  (ITT)  Set 
The Intent -to-Treat  (ITT)  Set will be used as the primary  population  for the analysis  of efficacy. 
The ITT Set will include all randomized patients. Patients will be analyzed according to 
randomized treatment.  
PROPRIETARY AND  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE  62 OF 84  
  STUDY : SEL-212/202 
VERSION : 3.0 EFFECTIVE  DATE  
08 JUN 2020  
  
13.2.4  Modified  ITT (mITT)  Set 
The modified ITT (mITT) Set will include all randomized patients who were administered at 
least one complete dose of study medication and have at least one post -baseline assessment of 
SUA.  Patients  will be analyzed  according  to randomized  treatment.  The mITT  will also be used 
for analyses of efficacy endpoints.  
13.2.5  Per Protocol  Set 
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) will include all patients who 1) were administered any amount of 
study medication, and 2) have completed at least 65% of the study dosing visits with or withou t 
receiving study drug (eg  at least 4 of 6 TP  Day 0 visits  for patients  receiving SEL -212 or at least 
8 of 12 TP Day 0 or Day14  visits  for patients  receiving Krystexxa)  unless  early  termination  from 
the study occurred after study drug withdrawal due to meeting stopping rules or due to an 
adverse event, or due to PI discretion (for example where at least one pre -dose SUA was >6 
mg/dL in the Krystexxa arm and patient was discontinued from study tre atment), and 3) who 
have no major Protocol deviations ( Section 13.3) affecting the primary efficacy assessments.  
Patients  will be analyzed  according  to randomized  treatment.  
 
13.3 Protocol  Deviat ions 
All protocol deviations related to study inclusion or exclusion criteria, conduct of the trial,  
patient management, dosing, and sampling procedures or patient assessment will be listed. The 
list of protocol deviations will be reviewed by the Sponsor, the principal investigator, the study 
statistician  and the study  pharmacokineticist  and finalized  before  database  lock. Determination  of 
whether the deviation is major or minor will be based on the biasing impact of the deviation on 
the safety and efficacy data.  
13.4 Efficacy  Analyses  
13.4.1  Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint  
The primary  efficacy  endpoint  is defined  as: 
 
• Comparison in the percentage of patients on SEL -212 vs. KRYSTEXXA who achieve 
and maintain  reduction  of SUA  < 6 mg/dL  for at least 80% of the time during  Treatment 
Period 3 and Treatment Period 6  
 
The primary estimand will take into consideration the treatment policy strategy, ie, Treatment 
Period 6 (and also Treatment Period 3) assessments will be considered for all subjects in ITT 
independently  whether  the subject  has completed  the study  treatment  or has terminated  early  the 
study  treatment.  Additionally,  the estimand  based  on the while -on-treatment  strategy  for dealing 
with study  treatment  terminators  will be defined.  For all used estimands  of the primary  efficacy, 
the estimator  for the comparison  between  the treatment  groups  is defined  as the difference  in the 
proportion of responders between subjects receiving SEL -212 versus those receiving 
KRYSTEXXA during Treatment Periods 3 and 6. The statistical testing will be performed 
confirmatory using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test – considering the randomization  
PROPRIETARY AND  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE  63 OF 84  
  STUDY : SEL-212/202 
VERSION : 3.0 EFFECTIVE  DATE

stratum  of tophus  presence  (yes/no) – with a one-sided  type 1 error  rate α = 5%. In addition , 90% 
two-sided confidence intervals for the overall treatment difference between SEL -212 and 
KRYSTEXXA treatment groups without stratification will be computed. The analysis of the 
estimands will be carried out based on  the ITT primarily. Supportive analy ses will be performed 
on the mITT and the PP. For each defined  estimand sensitivity analyses will be performed using 
different imputation approaches for missing values. Details of the applied approaches will be 
presented in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
The SUA time curve will be used to estimate the proportion of time that the  SUA level is below  
6 mg/dL. Based on  the serum samples  collected during Treatment Periods  3 and 6, an estimate of 
the time with SUA  < 6 mg/dL  can be determined by  connecting  each two neighboring  data points 
with a straight line. If the SUA time curve goes above 6 mg/dL the linear interpolation method 
will be used to estimate the point in time at which the  SUA time curve intercepts the line  
between the last SUA value  < 6 mg/dL and the first value ≥ 6 mg/dL.  
The proportion of time that the SUA level is < 6 mg/dL will be computed by taking the ratio 
between  the time during  which  the SUA  level  remains  < 6 mg/dL  (if necessary,  using  the linear 
interpolation method) and th e entire time interval within Treatment Periods 3 and 6.  
Let T1 be the total time interval in hours for Treatment Period 3 of which W1 hours is the time 
interval during which SUA level is < 6 mg/dL. Similarly, for Treatment Period 6, assume T2 is 
the total time interval  in hours  of which  W2 hours  is the time  interval  during  which  SUA  level  is 
< 6 mg/dL. For a subject  to be considered  a responder, the proportion of  time that the SUA  level 
is < 6 mg/dL during  Treatment  Periods  3 and 6 must  be at least 80%.  The proportion  of time that 
the SUA level is < 6 mg/dL, i.e., percentage of non -hyperuricemic time, is calculated using the 
following formula:  
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  =  
𝑊1 + 𝑊2 
𝑇1 + 𝑇2 × 100 
 
A logistic  regression  model  controlling  for the distribution  of baseline  characteristics  will be 
performed as supportive analysis.  
Summary  tables  of the percentage  of responder  (subjects  who achieve  and maintain  reduction  of 
SUA < 6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time) in each treatment period will be provided by 
treatment group.  Additionally,  a summary  table  with the total time a subject  has SUA  values  < 6 
mg/dL will be provided for each treatment period by treatment group.  
Summary  tables  of the actual  values and change  from  baseline  for SUA  results  will be provided 
for each scheduled sampling time point by treatment group.  
Additionally,  mean  SUA  level,  reduction  in mean SUA  and percent  reduction  in mean SUA  from 
baseline during Treatment Period 3 or Treatment Period 6 will be presented by treatment group.

• Mean SUA  level is defined as  the area under the SUA  time curve (computed using the 
linear  trapezoidal  rule during  Treatment  Periods  3 and 6) divided  by the corresponding 
time interva l. 
• Reduction  in mean  SUA  is computed  by subtracting  baseline SUA  level  from  mean  SUA 
during Treatment Period 3 and 6.  
• Percent  reduction  in the mean SUA  from  baseline  is computed  as the mean SUA  level 
during  Treatment  Periods  3 and 6 minus  baseline SUA  level  divided  by baseline SUA 
level multiplied by 100

for the comparison between the treatment groups. Summary tables of the number of swollen 
joints for each assessment timepoint and for the change from baseline will be provided by 
treatment group.  
13.4.3  Subgroup  Analyses  
In the event  of a prolonged  gout flare which is  not successfully  managed,  Investigators  will most 
likely treat patients with corticosteroids which will have a downstream effect on the duration of 
flares, swollen/tender jo int counts and QOL assessments. In order to better extrapolate the 
results, a subgroup analysis will be conducted for patients who receive “additional gout flare 
treatment” in  each arm for these objectives. Details  of this  subgroup analysis  will be  provide d in 
the SAP.

15.1 Study  Monitoring  
In accordance with applicable regulations, ICH -GCP and procedures covering the study, a 
monitor will contact the site prior to the subject enrollment to review the protocol and data 
collection  procedures  with site staff.  In addition,  the monitor  will periodically  contact  the site, 
including conducting on -site visits at an appropriate frequency to ensure data quality and to 
ensure the safety and rights of subjects are being protected.  
The investigator  agrees to allow the monitor direct  access to all relevant documents and to 
allocate  his/her  time and the time of his/her  staff to the monitor  to discuss  findings  and any 
relevant issues.  
15.2 Audits  and Inspections  
To ensure  complian ce with Good  Clinical  Practices  and all applicable  regulatory  requirements, 
quality  assurance audits may occur during  the study or after the study is complete. Authorized 
representatives of the Sponsor, the CRO conducting the study, a regulatory authority, an IRB 
may visit the site to perform audits or inspections to examine all study -related activities and 
documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, 
analyzed, and accurately reported according to the pro tocol, ICH -GCP, and any applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
If an audit or inspection occurs, the Investigator and institution agree to allow the 
auditor/inspector  direct  access  to all relevant  documents  and to allocate  his/her  time and the time 
of his/her  staff to the auditor/inspector to discuss findings and any relevant issues. The

16. ETHICS  AND  GOOD  CLINICAL  PRACTICE  COMPLIANCE  
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for 
designing,  conducting,  recording  and reporting  trials  that involve human  patients.  Compliance 
with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and well -being of study 
patients  are protected,  consistent  with the principles  that have  their origin  in the Declaration  of 
Helsinki ( World Medical Association 2013 ), and that the clinical trial data are credible.  
The study will be conducted under a US IND and all applicable US FDA and local laws and 
regulations  and Good  Clinical  Practice  Guidelines.  The Investigator  agrees  to conduct  the study 
in compliance with the current version of US Food Drug & Cosmetic Act, Section 21 CFR,  
Part 312, Subpart D (Responsibilities of Sponsor and Investigators), part 50 (Protection of 
Human Subjects), part 56 (Institutional Review Boards), the principles of the De claration of 
Helsinki, and with  the laws and regulations of the country in which the  research is conducted in 
order  to afford  the greatest  protection  to the individual.  The Investigator  must  fully  adhere  to the 
principles outlined in the “Guideline for Goo d Clinical Practice” International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) Tripartite Guideline and, for studies conducted in the EU/European 
Economic Area (EEA) countries, the Investigator will ensure compliance with the EU Clinical 
Trial Directive [2001/20/EC] . 
This study will be conducted in full compliance with the Institutional Review Board (IRB) / 
Ethics Committee (EC) regulations in 21 CFR 56 and applicable local regulatory guidance,  in 
accordance  with ICH-GCP.  IRB/EC  approval  for the investigation  must  be obtained  before  the 
study is initiated. Initial IRB/EC approval, and all materials approved by the IRB/EC for this 
study including the patient consent form and recruitment materials must be maintained by the 
Investigator and made available for inspection.

17. DATA  HANDLING  AND  RECORDKEEPING  
17.1 Data  Management  
17.1.1  Case  Report  Forms  
Data  for this study  will be recorded  via an EDC  system  using  eCRFs.  It will be transcribed  by 
the site from the paper source documents onto the eCRF.  
The information collected on eCRFs must be identical to the corresponding information 
appearing  in original source documents. There are no exceptions  to this rule. In general, source 
documentation  will be found  in a chart  maintained  by qualified  medical  person nel in a hospital, 
clinic, or physician’s office. (The eCRF is not considered as source data for this trial).  
Accurate and reliable data collection will be assured by verification and cross check of the 
eCRFs  against  the Investigator’s  records  by the study  monitor  (source  document  verification), 
and the maintenance of a drug dispensing log by the Investigator.  
As a matter of regulations, the Investigator is responsible for the accuracy  and authenticity of all 
clinical  and laboratory  data entered  onto eCRFs.  Prior  to submission,  each completed  eCRF  must 
be reviewed for accuracy by the Investigator, corrected as necessary, and then approved and e - 
signed. The Investigator’s e -signature serves to attest that the information contained on the 
eCRFs has been reviewed by the Investigator and is true and accurate.  
The eCRFs  should  be completed by  the Investigator  or a qualified designee  from  the site as soon 
as the data are available. Instructions for the completion of eCRFs will be provided.  
The eCRFs  will be considered  complete  when  all missing,  incorrect,  and/or  inconsistent  data 
have been accounted for.  
17.1.2  Retention  of Records  
An Investigator must maintain adequate records to include the disposition of the study 
medication(s) and adequate and accurate source do cumentation that record all observations and 
other  data pertinent  to the investigation  on each patient  in the study.  These  records  are to include 
the case report forms (CRFs), source documentation, and supporting data, including, for 
example, signed and da ted informed consent forms and medical records (including progress 
notes by the physician and/or other qualified medical personnel,  the patient’s hospital and clinic 
chart[s], and the nurses’ notes).  
The FDA  (21 CFR  §312.62[c])  states  that the Investigator  shall retain  the required  records:  
 
a. For a period  of 2 years  following  the date a marketing  application  is approved  for the 
drug for the indication for which it is being investigated; or  
b. If no application is to be filed or if the marketing appl ication is not approved for such 
indication,  until 2 years  after the investigation  is discontinued  and the FDA  is notified.  
PROPRIETARY AND  CONFIDENTIAL  PAGE  72 OF 84  
  STUDY : SEL-212/202 
VERSION : 3.0 EFFECTIVE  DATE  
08 JUN 2020  
  
If neither  a) nor b) applies,  then the Investigator  shall  retain  the required  records  for a minimum 
of 15 years after the completion or discontinuation of the study.  
For sites outside  the US, the Investigator  must  comply  with US FDA  regulations  and with the 
record  retention  policies  of the relevant  national  and local  health  authorities.  The Investigator 
must obtain the Sponsor’s written permission before disposing of any records.  
If the Investigator retires, relocates, or for any reason withdraws from the study, then the study 
records  may be transferred  to an acceptable  person  or institution  with the written  approval  of the 
Sponsor.

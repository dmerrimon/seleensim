Tertiary Objective:
A tertiary objective of this study is to evaluate patient satisfaction of various study 
parameters (such as switching to CUTAQUIG from another SCIG
product, satisfaction with infusion pump, changes in infusion regimen parameters,
general infection/general observations) using a study -specific ques tionnaire.
Study Design:  
The study is a prospective, open -label, non -controlled, 3-arm, multicenter, phase 3 
study.
Patients with a history of primary immunodeficiency (PI) disease that are currently 
on a stable dose of subcutaneously administered immunog lobulin ( SCIG )treatment
may be enrolled.
Stabilization Period  
After completing the Screening Period and being assigned to 1 of3cohorts (as
described below), patients will enter a 4 -week Stabilization Period . During this
period, patients will receive the ir first4CUTAQUIG infusions (Stabilization Period
Weeks 0, 1, 2, and 3) at the same body -weight dependent dose (mg/kg) and infusion
flow rate (m L/hr/site) as their previous SCIG product ; however , this flow rate should
not exceed maximum infusion rates li sted in protocol .
Note: patients entering the study for participation in Cohort 3 must already be
established on a week lyinfusion schedule for a minimum of 12 weeks prior to the
Screening Visit.
Patients entering the study already established on every other week dosing must
enter either Cohort 1 or Cohort 2andwill be required to dose weekly beginning at
the Stabil ization Week 0 .
Note:  patients entering the study currently active and established on  CUTAQUIG  in 
Study SCGAM -03 will have already been stabilized on CUTAQUIG  and would go 
directly into the Treatment Period  following the Screening Visit. The Screening Visit 
of Study  SCGAM -06 will occur on the same day as the final dosing visit for Study  
SCGAM -03. Procedures performed for Study SCGAM -03 that are also required for 
the Study SCGAM -06 Screening Visit do not need to be repeated  at the same visit .

Period.
Treatment Period  
After completing the 4 -week Stabilization Period, patients will enter the Treatment
Period and begin their infusi on parameters according to cohort assignment as
described below:
Cohort 1 (increased volume at each infusion site –patients will receive CUTAQUIG
weekly and increase infusion volumes every 4 weeks): Patients will return to the
clinic for the Treatment Pe riod Baseline Visit at which they will receive the same
body -weight dependent (mg/kg) dose but the volume will be increased byup to the
maximum allowed volume increase per infusion site of25mL/site for patients ≥40kg
or 10 mL/site for patients <40 kg. This volume increase per infusion sitecan be
achieved by reducing the total number of injection sites while maintaining similar or 
lower flow rate sas received with their prior treatment. When introducing increased
volume sto an infusion site, Investiga tors must attempt to maintain flow rates similar
toor lower than prior infusions. This may require adjusting pump rate, tubing size, 
needle gauge, etc. Patients will receive this new volume per site for 4 weekly 
infusions (Treatment Period Baseline and Weeks 1, 2, and 3), and return to the clinic
at Week 4 for their next infusion at an increased volume at each infusion site. This
cycle will continue, with infusion volumes increasing byup to a maximum allowed
volume increase per infusion sit e of25mL/site for patients ≥40kg or 10 mL/site for
patients <40 kgevery 4thinfusion until reaching a patient’s maximum dose (inmL),
maximum tolerated volume (maximum volume based on Investigator ’s decision of
patient ’s tolerance) , or 100mL at 1 injection site–whichever is reached first .
Note: Sites are encouraged to enroll patients intoCohort 1 who are already on a
dosing regimen using at least 3infusion site s to ensure thatvolume increases remain
below the protocol -specified limits . Patients dosing with 1infusion site cannot enter 
Cohort 1.
Investigators should be aware that special considerations are required for volume 
increases in patients with 2  infusion sites receiving a total dose ( volume ) of more 
than 50  mL. To ensure that volume increases do not exceed  25 mL/site, the 
infusions must be split between the 2  syringes , such that  each infusion site will 
receive a different total volume . For example, if a patient is receiving a total dose  of 
60 mL divided equally between 2 infusion sites (eg, 30  mL/site), the first syringe 
could  be increased to an  infusion volume of 50  mL (an increase of 20  mL) and the

second syringe would have an infusion volume of 10 mL. If this is tolerated, the next
infusion volume increase could be 60 mL at 1 infusion site (an increase of 10 mL)
and remain below the maximum allowed volume increase of 25 mL/site.
Cohort 2 (increased infusion rate -patients will receive CUTAQUIG weekly and
increase infusion rates every 4 weeks): Patients will return to the clinic for the
Treatment Period Baseline Visit, at which they will receive the same body -weight
dependent (mg/kg) dose ofCUTAQUIG but the infusion rate per site will be
increased up to a maximum allowed flow rate increase per infusion site of
25mL/hr/site for patients ≥40kg or 10 mL/hr/site for patients <40 kg. Patients will
receive this new flow rate for 4 weekly infu sions (Treatment Period Baseline and
Weeks 1, 2, and 3), and return to the clinic at Week 4 for their next infusion at an
increased infusion rate. This cycle will continue, with maximum allowed flow rate
increase sper infusion site ofup to 25mL/hr/site for patients ≥40kg or up
10mL/hr/site for patients <40 kgevery 4thinfusion until reaching either : 1)a 
maximum flow rate ( 100mL/hr/site) or themaximum flow rate achievable by the
pump ,or2) the maximum tolerated flow rate (maximum flow rate based on
Investigator’s decision of patient ’s tolerance )–whichever is reached first .
Note : Clinical sites are encouraged to enroll patients that are either currently infusing
with 24 -gauge needle sets or wil ling to switch to 24 -gauge needle sets. Patients 
using 27 -gauge needles will not be able to achieve adequate infusion rates for this 
cohort as the needle gauge will not allow for this.
Cohort 3 (every other week dosing -patients will receive CUTAQUIG every other
week at the equivalent of twice their body -weight dependent [mg/kg] weekly dose):
Patients will return to the clinic for the Treatment Period Baseline Visit to receive
their first double mg/kg weekly dose and begin an every other week dosing schedule.
Infusion volume increases when switching from weekly dosing to every other week 
dosing must not exceed  a maximum  allowed volume increase  per in fusion  site of 
25 mL/site for patients ≥40 kg or an increase of 10 mL/site for patients <40  kg at the 
Treatment Period Baseline Visit. If a patien t’s doubling of their weekly dose requires 
dosing with a volume of  more than the maximum allowed increase in volume per 
injection site ( 25 mL/site or 10  mL/site, dependent on patient body weight) , then they 
will be require d to increase the number of infusion sites to remain below the 
maximum body -weight dependent volume  increase. If this occurs, after 2  infusions 
the patient  may remove one of the newly introduced injection sites as long as the 
volume per  injection site  increase limit is not exceeded . Infusion flow rates will be

Study sites will be encouraged to enroll patients into all open cohorts.
The Sponsor will notify study sites when a cohort has filled and is no longer open to
recruitment.
Patients who enter and participate in one cohort may not enter another cohort at a
later time .
Patients entering the study currently active and established on CUTAQUIG in Study 
SCGAM -03 will have the Treatment Period Baseline Visit performed on the same
day as Termination V isit on Study SCGAM -03. Patients must first complete their
termination procedures for SCGAM -03, prior to their first infusion forStudy 
SCGAM -06. Procedures that are performed on the same day as part of Study 
SCGAM -03 termination that are also required as part of Study SCGAM -06Baseline , 
do not need to be repeated .Patients who completed the SCGAM -03 study and went

Study Outcome Parameters (Primary and Secondary Endpoints):
Primary Endpoint Parameters:
The co -primary objectives are to compare total IgG trough levels from weekly 
infusions to every other week infusions ,to assess safety and tolerability of
CUTAQUIG being administered according to 3different infusio n parameters ,and to
assess efficacy parameters when switching from weekly infusions to every other
week infusions . These will be assessed using the following safety variables:
•Change in individual total IgG trough levels from weekly infusions to every 
other week infusions
•Occurrence of treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) throughout the entire
Stabilization and Treatment Periods starting with the first infusion of
investigational medicinal product ( IMP)
•Occurrence of TEAEs temporally associated with CUTAQUIG  delivered
during the Treatment Period
•Occurrence of TEAEs temporally associated with CUTAQUIG  delivered
during the Stabilization Period
•TEAEs by speed of infusion
•Local infusion -site reactions
•Laborat ory parameters (hematology, clinical chemistry, and basic urinalysis)
Secondary Endpoint Parameters:  
Secondary objectives will evaluate quality of life, along with additional evaluations of 
CUTAQUIG  safety and efficacy being administered according to 3 different infusion 
parameters. These will be assessed using the following variables:

•Measurement of individual profiles of IgG trough levels over time (allcohorts)
•Monitoring for allinfectious disease occurrence, resolution, and antibiotic use
•Occurrence of serious bacterial infections (SBIs)
•Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, body temperature, respiratory rate)
Tertiary Endpoint Parameters:  
The tertiary objective will evaluate patient satisfaction of the study parameters (such
as switching to CUTAQUIG from another SCIG product, satisfaction with infusion
pump, changes in infusion regimen parameters, general infection/general
observations) . This will be as sessed using the following parameter:
•Subject Questionnaire
Study Procedures:  
Investigators will enroll p atients into the study only after written informed consent has
been obtained (and written assent where appropriate) . During the Screening Period ,
sites must obtain written approval from Octapharma prior to patients entering the
Stabilization Period (or Treatment Period, for subjects who are currently active and
established on CUTAQUIG in Study SCGAM -03).
The Flow Chart of Assessments includes fulldetails regarding all of the procedures
that will be performed at each study visit. Below is a brief summary of the procedures
that will be performed during the study.
Screening Period:
The Screening Visit should occur on approximately thesame day the patient is
scheduled to infuse with their personal SCIG product (or their final infusion of
CUTAQUIG inStudy SCGAM -03, if appropriate) in order to get an accurate IgG
trough level . After written informed consent/as sent has been obtained, patients will
be evaluated for study eligibility according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. These
evaluations will include demographics, medical history, physical examinations
(including body weight and vital signs ), current med ication use, blood and urine
sample collection (for evaluation ofclinical safety laboratory parameters, and IgG
trough levels as specified in the Flow Chart of Assessments. Following the
completion of all Screening procedures , thepatient will dose with t heir personal SCIG

product ( or CUTAQUIG from Study SCGAM -03, if applicable) at their typical dose
and infusion rate.
During the Screening Period (and after the infusion with their personal SCIG product
or CUTAQUIG from Study SCGAM -03, if applicable ), patients must not receive any 
other IgG product; therefore, it is anticipated that patients will receive their first dose
ofCUTAQUIG between 5 days and 16days after the Screening Visit.
Patients may be enrolled into any open cohort, based on Investigator and patient
preference :however ,patients entering the study already established on every other 
week dosing must enter either Cohort 1 or Cohort 2. After receiving written approval
from the Sponsor ,which will include confirmation that the chosen cohort is still open
for enrollment , patients who have met all of the inclusion criteria and none of the
exclusion criteria will return to the clinic for the ir first CUTAQUIG infusion in the
Stabilization Period .
Patients entering the study currently active and established on CUTAQUIG in Study 
SCGAM -03 will have their Screening Visitprocedures performed on the same day
as their last infusion visit on Study SCGAM -03. Patients must first complete their final
infusion for Study SCGAM -03 prior to being consented for Study SCGAM -06.
Procedures performed on the same day for Study SCGAM -03 that are also required
as part of Study SCGAM -06 do not need to be repeated .These patients willproceed
directly into the Treatment Period following completion of Screening .All other 
patients , including patients who completed their participation in Study SCGAM -03 
and went on a commercial SCIG product prior to the Screen ing Visit ,will need to
complete the Stabilization Period .
Stabilization Period
Study -required assessments will be performed as specified in the Flow Chart of 
Assessments including safety evaluations before and after each infusion. These 
assessments will i nclude updating medical history and current medication use, 
measuring body weight and vital sign s, collecting blood and urine sample s (for 
evaluation of clinical safety laboratory parameters  and for hepatitis C ), and collecting 
serum retention sample s. Patients will receive their infusion of C UTAQUIG and will 
be monitored for infusion site reactions  and AEs. Any concomitant medication use 
after the start of the infusion will be recorded.  
Prior to leaving the study site, patients will be dispensed CUTAQUIG  for in -home

trough levels, infusion of CUTAQUIG, monitoring for infusion site reactions and AEs,
review and dispensing of patient diary, and updating concomitant medication use.
For all cohorts at Base line, Week12, and Week 24, the following evaluations will
also be performed: physical examination and blood and urine sample collection for 
evaluation of clinical safety laboratory parameters (including urine pregnancy tests) . 
All p atients (or parent s/guardian s, as age -appropriate) will complete a QoL
questionnaire prior to IMP infusion at the Baseline Visit . Patients who entered the
Treatment Period after participation in Study SCGAM -03 (and therefore skipping the
Stabilization Period) will have serum ret ention and hepatitis C sample scollected at
the Baseline Visit.
Prior to leaving the study site, patients will be dispensed CUTAQUIG for in -home
infusions between site visits, along with detailed infusion instructions. Patients will
also be provided with a study diary in which they will record details of their home
treatment infusions, adverse events, and relevant concomitant medication use.
Termination Visit:
Patients in Cohort  1 and Cohort  2 will have their Termination Visit 1 week  (± 2 days)  
after last infusion, and patients in Cohort  3 will have their Termination Visit  2 weeks  
(± 2 days)  after the last infusion . All Termination Visit procedures must be performed 
prior to the patient receiv ing any other IgG product.  
For either regular or early termination, a Termination Visit will include  study 
assessments as indicated in the Flow Chart of Assessments.  These assessments 
will include  physical examinations (including body weight and vital sig ns), collection 
of blood and urine samples (for clinical safety laboratory parameters, and IgG trough 
levels), collection of serum retention and hepatitis C sample s, collection of AEs and

concomitant medication use, evaluation for infusion site reactions, and completion of
both a QoL questionnaire andtheSubject Questionnaire .
Independent Data Monitoring Committee:  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee will periodically review relevant data
with emphasis on AEs, including SAEs, and thromboembolic events . 
Statistical Analysis:  
This is an open -label, non -controlled, 3-arm study to primarily monitor safety and
tolerability for 3different dosing regimens and to assess efficacy parameters when
switching from weekly to every other week infusions of CUTAQUIG. The co -primary 
endpoints and most of the secondary endpoints will be assessed by means of
descriptive statistics. One of the primary endpoints, namely t he efficacy of
CUTAQUIG to maintain total IgG trough levels when administered every other week,
will be statistically tested, and the number of patients to be enrolled in Cohort 3 was
determined accordingly .
The following populations will be considered for the statistical analysis:
•Safety Analysis Set: all patients who received at least part of one infusion of
CUTAQUIG .
•Full Analysis Set (FAS): all patients in the Safety Analysis Set who satisfy all
major eligibility criteria and for whom any post-baseline data is available (per
intention -to-treat principle). This set of eligible patients will be used for
measurement of treatment effects.
•Per-Protocol (PP) Set: all patients in the FAS, excluding those with substantial
protocol deviations which may have an impact on the analysis of the
co-primary endpoints. This is the set of patients who participated in the study
as intended and for whom the co -primary endpoints can be evaluated as
planned.
Only substantial  protocol deviations with the potential  to significantly affect the study 
results or to invalidate the interpretation of the data obtained will lead to exclusion of 
patients from the PP set. The membership of each patient in the respective analysis 
populations will be determined before statisti cal analysis in a data review meeting by 
a panel consisting of a medical expert from the Sponsor, the clinical study manager, 
the data manager , and the study statistician .

In the event that a patient is not treated according to the dosing regimen described
for their assigned cohort, theoriginal cohort assignment willstillbe used for Safety 
and ITT analyses (SAF and FAS population s).These patients will be removed from
the PP population due to protocol violations.
Statistical Analysis Plan:  
A formal stat istical analysis plan describing all details of the analyses to be performed
will be prepared by the study statistician and approved by the Sponsor prior to start
of the statistical analysis .
The safety analysis will comprise descriptive statistics, tabula tions and listings of all
TEAEs, safety laboratory results, vital signs and physical examination findings. All
reported AEs will be coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities ( MedDRA ).
For each TEAE, the time relative to the start of the infusion will be calculated and the
TEAE will be classified as temporally associated if the onset is during the infusion or
within 72 hours after the end of the infusion.
All reported AEs will be listed and tabulated in full detail, in particular th e following
key figures will be presented for each cohort and for the study as a whole:
•Total number of TEAEs reported in the Stabilization and Treatment Periods
•Number of TEAEs temporally associated with CUTAQUIG delivered during
the Treatment Period
•Number of TEAEs temporally associated with CUTAQUIG  delivered during
the Stabilization Period
•Infusion rate at the onset of temporally associated TEAEs (frequencies and
percentages)
•Narratives will be prepared describ ing each death, other serious adverse
events ( SAEs ), and other significant AEs that are judged to be of special
interest because of clinical importance.
The QoL data will be presented descriptively by visit, along with the change from 
Baseline Visit . 
The Subject Questionnaire data will be presented descriptively.

Page  30 of 87 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
The primary therapeutic use of γ -immunoglobulins ( Immunoglobulin G or IgG) is to 
provide antibodies to prevent viral and bacterial diseases (replacement therapy) in 
patients with primary immunodeficiency (PI) syndromes w ho have significant defects 
of antibody formation (humoral immunity).  
The PI syndromes are a heterogeneous group of disorders with an intrinsic defect of 
the tissues, cells, or proteins of the immune system resulting in immune deficiency. 
Many of these dis orders are characterized by hypogammaglobulinaemia with or 
without defective antibody production. Children and adults with PI disease have an 
increased risk of recurrent bacterial and viral infections that typically attack the 
respiratory tract (sinusitis,  bronchitis, pneumonia) but can also affect the 
gastrointestinal tract (gastroenteritis). They can be severe and can lead to substantial 
morbidity. Responses to antibacterial therapy are often poor. At present, most PI  
disease s are not curable, but immunog lobulins have shown to decrease the total 
number of severe infections and the duration of hospitalization.  
In the earlier years (around 1950), the IgG preparations were administered 
intramuscularly. This route of administration causes substantial discomfort and 
restricts the amount of IgG that can be given to the patients. During the last 20  years, 
several IgG preparations have been developed for intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous 
(SC) administration, and their use has further contribute d to the successful treatment 
of patients with PI disorders.  
Administration via the SC route offers some advantages over IV infusion from a 
patient’s and a physician’s perspective and therefore become an alternative treatment 
option to the IV treatment. Af ter the introduction of small, portable syringe drivers, this 
route of administration has gained even more popularity in Europe and the US as a 
practical, effective and safe treatment, because home therapy can also be 
recommended with this kind of administ ration.  
There are two major differences in the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of 
intravenously administered immunoglobulins (IVIG) and subcutaneously administered 
immunoglobulins (SCIG): delayed absorption and reduced bioavailability.  
Following IV ad ministration, the plasma concentration peaks immediately upon 
termination of the infusion, frequently reaching concentrations more than twice as high 
as the trough level. After SC administration, the absorption of IgG into the 
subcutaneous tissue is slower ; the IgG must be delivered into the blood stream by the 
lymphatic system. Thus, with SCIG, the intravascular IgG concentration increases 
gradually, peaking at 48 to 72 hours. Most other features of SCIG treatment are 
consequences of these fundamental diff erences. [1] 
Studies of the PK of SCIG have shown a lower bioavailability than IVIG. This 
decreased bioavailability may involve degradation in the tissues and/or local binding 
in the intercellular matrix. Because of this expectation, several studies were designed 
to directly determine the bioavailability of SCIG as compared to IVIG. [2]

Page  31 of 87 On converting from IVIG to SCIG replacement therapy for PI  disease , the equivalent 
monthly dose of IgG is us ually determined in one of two ways:  
• 1:1 dosing: The single IVIG dose administered every 3 (or  4) weeks is split into 
3 (or 4) equal weekly SCIG infusions.  
• Dosing based on the area under the curve (AUC). The SCIG dose is calculated 
from PK data to provide a monthly exposure to IgG equivalent to that with IVIG.  
The former is common in Europe, while the latter is a requirement of the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) for SCIG labelling studies. [3] A recent study demonstrated  
the dose convers ion factor for CUTAQUIG  was 1.37 .[4] Also,  the CUTAQUIG Package 
Insert recommends a dose conversion  factor of 1.4 .[5] 
No differences have been reported in the half -life of SCIG and IVIG. With modern IgG 
preparations, half -lives have generally been reported to be about 30  to 35  days. Thus, 
there is no clinically significant difference in the half -life of IgG between the two 
administration routes. [1] 
However, SCIGs are usually given weekly, compared with IVIG regimens in which a 
large dose is given every 3rd or 4th week. The use of smaller doses at more frequent 
intervals results in stable, higher trough IgG serum concentrations which remain 
const ant between consecutive SCIG infusions. [6] 
In 3 prior studies comparing IVIG and SCIG in PI patients, the mean peak serum IgG 
level immediately after IV infusions was 2303  mg/dL. [7-9] In contras t, the mean peak 
with SCIG was 1410  mg/dL and the time for the peak IgG concentration (Tmax) was 
62.6 h (2.6  days). [10] 
With weekly SCIG administrations, only about 4.5 days elapse between the Tmax of 
one dose and the adminis tration of the next dose. Given the half -life of 30 days, this 
means that the IgG plasma concentration has dropped by only about 10% to 20% 
before the serum level starts to rise again. In contrast, with IVIG dosing intervals of 
3 to 4 weeks (about one half -life), the drop in plasma concentration will be about 40% 
to 50% by the time the next dose is due. These differences in the dosing intervals used 
in most SCIG versus IVIG regimens result in more stable serum IgG levels with 
SCIG. [1,10]  
Pooled data from 7  studies in which equivalent monthly SC IgG doses were given 
weekly versus IVIG every 21  to 28  days showed that trough serum IgG levels were 
10% to 20% higher with weekly SC doses than with the same total monthly IVIG dose. 
After 6  to 12  weekly infusions, near -steady -state IgG levels were achieved with 
differences between minimum and peak concentrations of only 5%  to 10%  of the 
overall mean. [1,10]  
Population PK modelling has been used to p redict IgG exposure following a range of 
SCIG dosing regimens including frequent weekly dosing ( 1 to 7 times per week) and 
every other week dosing. This broad range of SCIG dosing regimens was simulated 
to predict s teady -state serum IgG exposures . This PK modelling study  consisting of 
2,500  patients was simulated to compare steady -state IgG concentration time profiles 
betwe en weekly SCIG administrations with other frequenc ies, including daily through 
every other week  dosing . The results produced ove rlapping steady -state 
concentration -time profile and similar AUC, C max, and C min values. This  simulation

Page  32 of 87 concluded that the same total weekly SCIG do se can be administered at different 
intervals, frequent or every other week, with minimal impact on serum I gG levels. [11] 
No clinical data are available that would allow comparison of the long -term efficacy of 
SCIG versus IVIG administration on the development of bronchiectasis or other 
changes on lung scans, nor on deterioration of pulmonary function in patients who 
have PI. Similarly, no data are available comparing the efficacy of SCIG versus IVIG 
on the persistence or progression of chronic sinus disease in PI patients with that 
problem, or on other complications of PI. [12] 
Orange et al (2012) reviewed the clinical efficacy of SCIG and identified 13  clinical 
studies in a total of 482  patients representing more than 27,500  infusions. The rate of 
serious bacterial infections (SBIs) was the most common primary efficacy endpoint in 
these studies. Secondary endpoints included overall infections (ie,  infections not 
meeting SBI criteria), missed days at work or school, days in hospital and days on 
antibiotics. Definitions of overall infections and SBI  were not standardized across 
studies. In 6  studies, SBIs were defined by FDA criteria and included bacterial 
pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis, osteomyelitis or visceral abscess. In 2  studies, an SBI 
was defined as an infection requiring hospitalization. [3] 
The rate of SBI was reported in 11  studies and varied from 0  to 0.09  events per patient 
per year. Infections were reported in 11  studies and varied from 2  to 5.18  events per 
patient per year. These rates are overall at least a s low as those reported for IVIG 
studies.  
To provide adequate protection from infection, a serum IgG concentration of >5  g/L 
following IgG therapy has been recommended. Several retrospective studies and one 
prospective study, however, have shown that highe r serum IgG concentrations 
resulting from higher doses of IVIG are associated with a decreased incidence of 
infections. [3] 
A previous  meta -analysis in 16  individual studies of IVIG focused on the diagnosis of 
pneumonia, the m ost comparable endpoint, and demonstrated a statistically significant 
inverse correlation between higher IgG dose and a lower incidence of pneumonia, with 
a 27% decrease in incidence of pneumonia for every 100  mg/kg increase in dose. [13] 
Despite its well -established safety profile, IVIG often leads to undesired symptoms 
ranging from mild systemic adverse reactions (including flushing, fever, muscle aches, 
tiredness, headache, and dizziness) to severe reactions (including chest  pain, 
tachycardia, changes in blood pressure, aseptic meningitis, thrombosis, and renal 
failure). [4] 
The slower rate of rise towards the peak serum IgG level and the truncation of its height 
are believed to be responsible fo r the much lower incidence of systemic adverse 
events (AEs) with SCIG. This is consistent with observations that many AEs of IVIG 
infusions are rate -related and have been repeatedly confirmed. [12] 
On the other hand, local rea ctions at SC injection sites are common. These  reactions 
are rarely severe and are accepted by most patients. In the meta -analysis by Orange 
et al the reporting rate varied from 0.028 to 0.697 per infusion demonstrating that the 
majority of patients tolera te SCIG well. [3]

Page  33 of 87 CUTAQUIG , the investigational medicinal product (IMP) in this study, is an 
immunoglobulin preparation from human normal plasma and is manufactured by 
Octapharma. It contains 16.5% (165  mg/mL) protein. The product is formulated for SC 
infusion by pump or syringe.  
A recent study of 61  patients who were previously treated with IVIG received a total of 
64 weekly SCIG infu sions of CUTAQUIG  (equating to 3,497  total infusions of 
CUTAQUIG ); no serious bacterial inf ections developed among any patients during the 
study. The rate of other infections per person -year during the primary observation 
period was 3.43 (upper 95%  CI: 4.57). [4] 
CUTAQU IG was approved by the US  FDA in December  2018 for the treatment of 
primary humoral immunodeficiency in adults. Further information on the IMP can be 
found in the Investigator’s Brochure  and the US FDA-approved Package Insert. [5] 
1.2 Rationale for Conducting the Study  
The administration of immunoglobulins via the SC route offers several advantages 
over IV infusion from a patient’s and a physician’s perspective. Replacement therapy 
by rapid SC infusion with a pump was introduced during the late 1980s. Several reports 
have shown that the SC method is feasible, safe, efficient, cost -effective, and highly 
appreciated by the patients. [4,14 -22] 
Self-administration at home with small portable pumps or syringes can easily be 
learned by patients, which is another advantage of SC administered immunoglobulins 
(SCIG). It may remarkably improve the patient’s quality of life and compliance as it 
reduces the frequency of hospitalizations and the need for in -home health care 
visitations. Administration of IgG via the SC route provides more stable and well -
balanced IgG plasma levels until the end of the treatment interval, in contrast with the 
peak IgG plasm a concentrations attained with IVIG solutions which weaken at the end 
of dose. When effective IVIG therapy cannot be continued because of the lack of 
peripheral and central vein access, SCIG might also be an alternative treatment option.  
Patients may desir e dosing flexibility to accommodate their personal schedules or 
reduce the number of injection sites; therefore, this study is investigating modified 
dosing regimens. These modifications include dosing at higher infusion rates to 
shorten the duration of in fusions, dosing every  other  week (rather than every week) to 
reduce the overall number of infusions, and increased volume at injection site(s) to 
reduce the number of injection sites. These modifications may reduce dosing 
commitments by shortening infusion  times  or increasing time intervals between 
infusions or decreasing injection sites, which may correlate to increased drug 
compliance.  
Experience has shown that replacement therapy with immunoglobulins is lifesaving . If 
replacement is started early, and if  appropriate amounts are given with sufficient 
frequency, the cycle of recurrent infections and progressive lung damage can be 
arrested. Near to normal serum IgG levels can be easily maintained.  
Post-dose peak levels of SCIG are usually reached 3  to 6 days  after infusion. It has 
been shown that after infusion, exogenous IgG is distributed relatively rapidly between 
plasma and extravascular fluid until approximately half is partitioned in the 
extravascular space. Therefore, a rapid initial drop in serum IgG is to be expected.

Page  34 of 87 Several factors such as the endogenous production, the actual catabolism rate, the 
underlying disease or inter -patient variability help to explain the wide range observed 
for terminal half -lives. PK data are required for each new product  to ensure that it will 
not behave differently from existing preparations, in terms of appropriate dose and 
timing of the infusions.  
The Sponsor is currently conducting clinical stud ies that are investigating the PK 
characteristics  (SCGAM -01), along with t he efficacy and safety , of CUTAQUIG , 
(SCGAM -01 and SCGAM -03) in order to provide guidance on the dosing when 
switching patients from IV to SC treatment in patients suffering from PI  disease . 
This current study (SCGAM -06) is designed to evaluate modified do sing regimens that, 
by reducing dosing time commitments or injection sites  or allowing greater flexibility 
with dosing,  may result in increased patient compliance  and treatment satisfaction . 
To that aim, the principal purposes of this study are to:  
• Compar e total IgG trough levels from weekly infusions to every other week 
infusions  
• Assess safety and tolerability of CUTAQUIG  when administered at increased 
infusion volumes  
• Assess safety and tolerability of CUTAQUIG  when administered at increased 
infusion rate s 
• Assess safety and tolerability of CUTAQUIG  when administered every other 
week  
• Assess the effect of CUTAQUIG  on quality -of-life (QoL) measures  
• Acquire additional safety and efficacy data on CUTAQUIG  
• Assess patient satisfaction with the study parameters using the Subject 
Questionnaire  
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, International Conference 
on Harmonisation -Good Clinical Practice (ICH -GCP), US FDA Code of Federal 
Regulation s, and other local regulatory requirements.  
1.3 Benefit -Risk Statement  
Patients with PI need life -long treatment with immunoglobulins. Replacement therapy 
is expected to achieve protective trough levels of 5  g/L to 6  g/L. 
Standard measures are taken to prevent  infections resulting from the use of medicinal 
products prepared from human blood or plasma. Despite this, when medicinal products 
prepared from human blood or plasma are administered the possibility of transmitting 
infective agents cannot totally be excl uded. The virus inactivation methods for 
CUTAQUIG  are described in the Investigator's Brochure.  
The safety profile of SCIG is well characterized, and the same type of adverse 
reactions may be expected from CUTAQUIG . No new or unknown safety problems are 
expected to emerge for CUTAQUIG  which are not already described in the 
Investigator's Brochure.  
It can be reasonably assumed that CUTAQUIG  exhibits the same effectiveness as 
other SCIG approved products.

assessed using the following variables:  
• Change in individual total IgG trough levels from weekly infusions to every other 
week infusions  (Cohort  3) 
• Occurrence of treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) throughout the entire 
Stabilization and Treatment Periods starting with the first infusion of IMP  
• Occurrence of TEAEs temporally associated with CUTAQUIG  delivered during 
the Treatment Period

the Stabiliza tion Period  
• TEAEs by speed of infusion  
• Local infusion -site reactions  
• Laboratory parameters (hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis ) 
3.1.2  Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary assessment criteria will evaluate  quality of life, along with additional 
evaluations of CUTAQUIG  safety and efficacy being administered according to 
3 different infusion parameters. These will be assessed using the following variables:  
• QoL assessments using the Short Form Health Survey, 36  item ( SF-36) or 
10 item (SF -10) 
• Occurrence of serious b acterial infections (SBIs)  
• Annual rate of all infections of any kind or seriousness  
• Time to resolution of infections  
• Use of antibiotics (number of days and annual rate)  
• Individual profiles of IgG trough levels over time (all cohorts)  
• Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, body temperature, respiratory rate)   
3.1.3  Tertiary Endpoint  
Tertiary assessment criteria will  evaluate the patient’s satisfaction with the study 
parameters  (such as switching to CUTAQUIG from another SCIG product,  satisfaction

Page  38 of 87 3.2 Overall Study Design and Plan  
The study is a pro spective, open -label, non -controlled, 3-arm, multicenter, phase  3 
safety study with observation of patients receiving weekly doses of CUTAQUIG  at 
increasing infusion volumes or flow rates, receiving every other week  doses of 
CUTAQUIG  at double the weekly d ose, over a period of up to approximately 6  months.  
Patients with a history of PI disease that are currently on a stable dose of SCIG 
treatment will be enrolled into 1  of 3 cohorts as defined below:  
Cohort 1 (increased infusion volume) : This cohort will in clude patients who consent to 
receiving CUTAQUIG  at increasing infusion volumes at each site until reaching a 
maximum dose  (in mL) , maximum tolerated volume (maximum infusion volume per 
site based on Investigator ’s decision of patient ’s tolerance ), or 100 mL at 1  injection 
site is reached  – whichever is reached first . 
Cohort 2 (increased infusion rate) : This cohort will include patients who consent to 
receiving CUTAQUIG  at increasing flow rates until either 1) a maximum flow rate 
(100 mL/hr/site) o r the maximum flow rate achievable by the pump, or 2) the maximum 
tolerated flow rate (maximum flow rate based on Investigator’s decision of patient’s 
tolerance ) – whichever is reached first .  
Cohort 3 (every other week dosing) : This cohort will include pa tients who consent to 
receiving CUTAQUIG  every other week at the same or equivalent of twice their weekly 
body -weight dependent (mg/kg) dose. Infusion flow rates will be determined by the 
patient and Investigator , but initially should not exceed the patient’s prior infusion rate . 
Patients in this cohort must be currently on  a weekly infusion regimen for a minimum 
of 12  weeks prior to entering the study.  
All Cohorts:  All study sites will be encouraged to enroll patients into all open cohorts . 
It is at the Investigator ’s discretion, with input from the patient, to  determine the optimal 
cohort based on medical history, patient preference, etc. However, p atients entering 
the study already established on every other week dosing will only be permitted to 
enter Cohort  1 or Cohort  2, and must agree  to begin dosing every week beginning at 
Stabilization Period Week  0. The Sponsor will notify study sites when a cohort has 
been filled and is no longer open to recruitment.  Study -related procedures will begin 
only af ter written informed consent (and assent, if age -appropriate) has been obtained 
from the patient.  
After completing the Screening Period during which they will be assigned to 1  of the 
3 study cohorts, patients will enter a 4 -week Stabilization Period. Durin g the 
Stabilization Period, patients will receive CUTAQUIG  infusions at the same body -
weight dependent dose  and infusion rate as their previous SCIG product prior to 
entering the Treatment Period ; however, this flow rate should not to exceed maximum 
infusi on rates listed in protocol  (Section  5.5.3 ). Patients will receive 4  CUTAQUIG  
infusions  during the Stabilization Period. Patients entering the study currently active 
and established on CUTAQUIG in Study SCGAM -03 will have already been s tabilized 
on CUTAQUIG and will go directly into the Treatment Period following the Screening 
Visit. Patients that completed the SCGAM -03 study and went on a commercial SCIG  
product prior to entering SCGAM -06 are required to enter the Stabilization Period.  
During the Treatment Period, patients will receive CUTAQUIG  infusions according to 
their assigned -cohort infusion parameters.

Page  39 of 87 Throughout the study, the following interventions and procedures will be performed at 
predefined time points ( Section  6.1.2  and the Flow Charts of Assessments Table 1 
[Screening and Stabilization Periods ], Table 2 [Cohort  1], and Table 3 [Cohort  2], 
Table 4 [Cohort  3]): blood draws for laboratory assessments, body weight 
measurement, patient diary review , physi cal examination including vital signs, local 
infusion -site reaction assessments, urine sampling, urine pregnancy tests, QoL 
assessments , and the Subject Questionnaire . AEs and any changes in concomitant 
medications will be recorded throughout the study per iod. 
Patients who enter and participate in one cohort may not enter another cohort at a later 
time.  
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will periodically review relevant 
data throughout the study with emphasis on adverse events including seriou s adverse 
events and thromboembolic events.  
The study will be conducted at study sites in the USA . 
3.3 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Group(s)  
3.3.1  Study Design  
The study design is in line with similar study protocols conducted with other SCIG 
brands. [21,23,24]  
3.3.2  Dosing  
Stabilization Period:  CUTAQUIG  will be administered subcutaneously every week 
(±2 days).  
Treatment Period:  CUTAQUIG  will be administered subcutaneously every week 
(±2 days) (or every other week [ ±2 days ], if applicable)  for Cohort  1 (increased infusion 
volume) and Cohort  2 (increased infusion rate) . For Cohort  3, CUTAQUIG  will be 
administered every other week (±2  days) at double  the weekly dose.  
Cohort 1  (increased volume at each infusion site – patients will receive CUTAQUIG  
weekly and increase infusion volumes every 4  weeks): Patients will return to the clinic 
for the Treatment Period Baseline Visit, at which they will receive the same body -
weight dependent (mg/kg) dose but the volume will be increased by up to the maximum 
allowed volume increase per infusion site  of 25 mL/site  for patients ≥40 kg or 
10 mL/site for patients <40  kg. This volume increase per infusion site can be achieved 
by reducing the total number of injection sites while keeping the same or lower flow 
rates as received with their prior treatment. When introducing increased volume s to an 
infusion site, Investigator s must attempt to maintain flow rates similar to or lower than 
prior infusions.  This may require adjusting pump rate, tubing  size, needle gauge, etc. 
Patients will receive this new volume per site for 4  weekly infusions (Treatment Period 
Baseline and Weeks  1, 2, and 3), and return to the clinic at Week  4 for their next 
infusion at an increased volume at each infusion site. This cycl e will continue, with 
infusion volumes increasing by up to a maximum allowed volume increase per infusion 
site of 25 mL/site for patients ≥40 kg or 10  mL/site for patients <40  kg every 4th infusion 
until reaching a patient’s maximum dose  (in mL), maximum tolerated volume 
(maximum volume based on Investigator’s decision of patient’s tolerance) , or 100 mL

Page  40 of 87 at 1 injection site – whichever is reached first . For patients with maximum volume that 
exceeds 100 mL at 1 injection  site, 2 injection sites should be used . 
The following change in volume increments should be followed:  
• Baseline: Reduce the number of injection sites by  1 (eg, patients  using a 
4 needle set will reduce to a 3 needle set ). Tubing set, needle gauge , and pump 
rates ( if applicable)  may be adjus ted to minimize flow rate variations . 
Investigators must ensure minimal flow rate changes at each injection site when 
increasing volume.  Continue with the same infusion  parameters at Weeks  1, 2, 
and 3. 
• Week 4: If the volume increase administered at Baseline through Week  3 is 
tolerated, r educe the number of injections  sites again by 1 (eg, patients  using  a 
3 needle set will reduce to a 2 needle set ). Tubing set, needle gauge , and pump 
rates ( if applicable)  may be  adjusted to minimize flow rate variations . 
Investigators must ensure minimal flow rate changes at each injection site when 
increasing volume . Continue with the same infusion parameters at Weeks  5, 6, 
and 7. 
• Week 8: If the volume increase administered at W eek 4 through Week  7 is 
tolerated, r educe the number of injection sites again by 1 (eg, patient s using a 
2 needle set will reduce to a 1 needle set ). Tubing set, needle gauge , and pump 
rates ( if applicable) may be adjusted to minimize flow rate variations . 
Investigators must ensure minimal flow rate changes at each injection site when 
increasing volume . Continue with the same infusion parameters at Weeks  9, 10, 
and 11. 
• Weeks  12, 16 , and 20: If the volume increase administered at Week  8 through 
Week 11 is tolerated, continue the  step-down  process  until reaching the 
patient’s maximum dose  (in mL), maximum tolerated volume (maximum volume 
based on Investigator’s decision of patient’s tolerance) , or 100 mL at 1  injection 
site (whichever is reached fir st) as described above.  The same step -down 
procedure should be repeated as described at Week  16 and Week  20, if needed 
and based on the Investigator’s decision of patient’s tolerance .  
Investigators should be aware that special considerations are required for volume 
increases in patients with 2  infusion sites receiving a total dose (volume) of more than 
50 mL divided between  2 infusion sites. To ensure that volume increases do not 
exceed  25 mL/site, the infusions must be split between the 2  syringes, such that each 
infusion site will receive a different total volume. For example, if a patient is receiving 
a total dose of 60  mL divided equally between 2 infusion sites (eg, 30  mL/site), the  first 
syringe could be increased to an infusion volume of 50  mL (an increase of 20  mL) and 
the second syringe would have an infusion volume of 10  mL. If this is tolerated, the 
next infusion volume increase could be 60  mL at 1  infusion site (an increase of  10 mL) 
and remain below the maximum allowed volume increase of 25 mL/site.  
If adverse drug reactions ( ADRs) occur during an infusion, the patient  may go back to 
the previous regimen that was tolerated  if deemed necessary by the Investigator 
and/or patient ; this would include reintroducing an injection site. This infusion regimen 
will continue until the next study visit  at which the patient  would again attempt to 
remove an injection site. If ADRs occur again, the patient  may again go back to the 
previous st able regimen if deemed necessary until the next study visit.  Following

Page  41 of 87 unsuccessful attempts to increase volume, the Investigator and patient can cease or 
hold additional attempts and remain in the study ; however , every effort to increase 
injection site vo lumes should be attempted.  
Optional:  When modifying the number of injection site s after previous unsuccessful 
attempts, the Investigator can make adjustments to lower the flow rate. This may 
include decreasing pump flow rate, revising the tubing , or chang ing needle gauge.  
Note:  Sites are encouraged to enroll patients into  Cohort  1 who are already on a 
dosing regimen using at least 3  infusion sites to ensure that volume increases  remain 
below limits listed in Table 6. Patients dosing with 1 infusion site cannot enter Cohort  1. 
Cohort 2  (increased infusion rate - patients will receive CUTAQUIG  weekly and 
increase infusion rates every 4  weeks): Patients will return to the clinic for the 
Treatment Period Baseline Visit, at which they will receive the same body -weight 
dependent (mg/kg) dose of CUTAQUIG  but the infusion rate per site will b e increased 
by up to a maximum allowed flow rate increase per infusion site  of 25 mL/hr/site  for 
patients ≥40 kg or 10  mL/hr/site for patients <40  kg. Patients will receive this new flow 
rate for 4  weekly infusions (Treatment Period Baseline and Weeks  1, 2, and 3), and 
return to the clinic at Week  4 for their next infusion at an increased infusion rate. This 
cycle will continue, with maximum allowed flow rate increase s per infusion site  of up 
to 25 mL/hr/site  for patients ≥40 kg or 10  mL/hr/site for patient s <40  kg every 4th 
infusion until reaching either 1) a maximum flow rate ( 100 mL/hr/site)  or the maximum 
flow rate achievable by the pump,  or 2) the maximum tolerated flow rate (maximum 
flow rate based on Investigator’s decision of patient’s tolerance ) – whichever is 
reached first .  
The following rate increases should be followed:  
• Baseline: Increase infusion rates up to 25 mL/hr/site. This can be accomplished 
by increasing the tubing set, needle gauge , and adjusting pump rates ( if 
applicable).  Continue with the same infusion parameters at Weeks  1, 2, and  3. 
• Week 4: I f the infusion rate increase administered at Baseline through Week  3 
is tolerated, i ncrease infusion rates again by up to 25 mL/hr/site  for patients 
≥40 kg or 10  mL/hr/site for pati ents <40  kg. This can be accomplished by 
increasing the tubing set,  increasing  needle gauge, or adjusting pump rates ( if 
applicable). Continue with the same infusion parameters at Weeks  5, 6, and  7. 
• Week 8: If the infusion rate increase administered at Wee k 4 through Week  7 
was tolerated, i ncrease infusion rates again by up to 25 mL/hr/site  for patients 
≥40 kg or 10  mL/hr/site for patients <40  kg. This can be accomplished by 
revising the tubing , increasing needle gauge, or adjusting pump rates (where 
applicable).  Continue with the same infusion parameters at Weeks  9, 10, 
and 11. 
• Weeks  12, 16 and  20: If necessary  and if the infusion rate increase 
administered at Week  8 through Week  11 was tolerated,  the patient  should 
continue the rate increase process as described above.  
Note:  Clinical sites are encouraged to enroll patients that are either currently infusing 
with 24 -gauge needle sets or willing to switch to 24 -gauge needle sets. Patients using 
27-gauge needles will not be able to achieve adequate infus ion rates for this cohort as 
the needle gauge will not allow for this.

Page  42 of 87 If ADRs occur during an infusion, the patient  may go back to the previous regimen that 
was tolerated  if deemed necessary by the Investigator and/or patient ; this would 
include decreasin g the infusion flow by  decrease tubing size, increasing needle gauge, 
or adjusting pump rates. This tolerated infusion regimen will continue until the next 
study visit, at which the patient  would attempt to again increase the infusion rate. 
If ADRs occur again, the patient  may again go back to the previous stable regimen if 
deemed necessary until the next study visit. If multiple attempts to increase rate are 
unsuccessful, Investigators should continue attempting to increase rates, but by lower 
amoun ts than those previously attempted. Investigators should refer to the provided 
flow rate tubing calculators to identify optimal rate parameters.  Following unsuccessful 
attempts to increase infusion rate , the Investigator and patient can cease or hold 
addit ional attempts and the patient may remain in the study ; however , every effort to 
increase infusion rates should be attempted.  
Cohort 3  (every other week dosing - patients will receive CUTAQUIG  every other week 
at the equivalent of twice their weekly body -weight dependent [mg/kg] dose): Patients 
will return to the clinic for the Treatment Period Baseline Visit to receive their first 
double mg/kg weekly dose and begin an every other week dosing schedule. Infusion 
volume increases  when switching from weekly do sing to every other week dosing  must 
not exceed a maximum allowed volume increase per infusion site  of 25 mL/site for 
patients ≥40 kg or 10  mL/site for patients <40  kg at the Treatment Period Baseline 
Visit. If a patient’s doubling of their weekly dose requires dosing with a volume of more 
than the maximum allowed increase in volume per injection site (25  mL/site or 
10 mL/site, dependent on patient body weight ), then they will be required to increase 
the number of infusion sites to remain below the maximum body -weight dependent 
volume increase. If this occurs, after 2  infusions the patient may remove one of the 
newly introduced injection sites as long as the volume per injection site  increase limit 
is not  exceeded. Infusion flow rates will be determined by the patient and Investigator , 
but initially should not exceed the patient’s prior infusion rate , nor the maximum 
infusion rates listed in the protocol . If a patient initially does not tolerate the dosing  
regimen, the Investigator should decrease the infusion  rate to a tolerable rate ( revising 
the tubing , number of injection sites, needle gauge, etc.).  
Note:  Patients entering must already be established on weekly dosing for a minimum 
of 12  weeks prior to Screening . 
All Cohorts:  If, during the study, a patient's body weight changes by >5%  from the 
first infusion of IMP,  the dose will be adjusted to keep a constant  mg/kg body weight 
basis. Additional adjustments will be made if the patient’s body weight changes >5% 
from the previous adjust ed weight.  In addition, individual patient doses may be titrated 
up or down, per Investigator discretion.  
Dosing will take place on site at study visits, a nd otherwise at the patient's home by 
self-administration or with assistance (relative, caregiver, etc.).  The Termination Visit 
must occur  prior to the patient receiving any other IgG product.

4.2 Prior and Conco mitant Therapy  
Details on any relevant medication s taken within 8 weeks  prior to enrol lment must be 
recorded in the electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF). The following medications that 
are considered relevant for the previous 8  weeks include:  
• Antibiotics  
• Corticosteroids ,  
• Premedication (if used)  
• Immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs  
• blood or any blood product or derivative  
• IVIG, SCIG , or other IgG preparations  
All new and ongoing  concomitant medications taken during  the Screening  Period  and 
throughout the study will be captured  in the eCRF.  
4.2.1  Permitted Concomitant Therapy  
Local anesthetics  (EMLA® or lidocaine cream, plaster, or other similar products) to 
reduce pain associated with needle insertion are allowed. The use of such 
medication(s) must be recorded.  
Routine premedication  to alleviate potential tolerability problems is not allowed during 
the study. However, patients who experience 2  consecutive TEAEs during the study 
(that are likely to be prevented by premedication) are permitted to receive antipyretics, 
antihistamines, or antiemetic drugs. Non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs should be 
avoided.  
4.2.2  Forbidden Concomitant Therapy  
Treatment with any IMP (other than IgG products [including CUTAQUIG ] administered 
during Study  SCGAM -03) within 3  months before first infusion of CUTAQUIG , or 
during the study, is forbidden.  Patients receiving another investigational SCIG product 
within 3  months prior to the first CUTAQUIG infusion may be considered for enrollment 
after Sponsor approval.  
Administration of any blood - or plasma -derived product is forbidden during the study 
and s hould only be given for emergency reasons. Patients will be withdrawn from the 
study if IgG preparations other than CUTAQUIG  are administered during the study.  
Premedication for study CUTAQUIG  infusions shall not be given, with the exception of 
permitted t herapy as stated above (for patients with 2  consecutive TEAEs).

CUTAQUIG  must not be mixed with other medicinal products.  
4.3 Withdrawal and Replacement of Patients  
4.3.1  Premature Patient Withdrawal  
Patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason, without 
the need to justify their decision. The Investigator also has the right to withdraw 
patients in case of AEs, poor compliance, or other reasons. Because  an excessive rate 
of withdrawals can render the study noninterpretable, any unnecessary withdrawal of 
patients should be avoided.  
For any withdrawals after study entry, the Investigator will obtain all the required details 
and document the reason(s) for discontinuation. If the reason for withdrawal of a 
patient  is an AE, the main specific eve nt or laboratory test will be recorded, and the 
Investigator will make thorough efforts to clearly document the outcome.  
Reasons for premature patient withdrawal may include the following:  
• Patient decision:  Should a patient decide to withdraw from the stud y, the 
Investigator will make a reasonable effort to complete and report all information 
available at time of withdrawal. The Investigator will document the reason(s) for 
the patient's discontinuation.  
• Withdrawal for safety reason : If the reason a patient is removed from the study 
is an AE or an abnormal laboratory test result, this specific event or test will also 
be recorded; the Investigator will make a reasonable effort to clearly document 
the outcome.  
• Administration of other immunoglobulin preparation : If for any reason a patient's 
therapy is changed to another IVIG or SCIG preparation within this study, the 
patient will be withdrawn from the study.  
• Pregnancy:  Pregnant patients may not be included in this study. A pregnancy 
test is mandatory for all fem ales of child bearing potential at the Screening Visit, 
at the Treatment Period Weeks  12, 24 and at the Termination Visit. All female 
patients of childbearing potential are responsible for using effective 
contraception during their study participation. If a pregnancy occurs, treatment 
with CUTAQUIG  must be stopped immediately and Octapharma’s Central Drug 
Safety Unit must be informed.  
If a patient is withdrawn, the Investigator will schedule an (Early) Termination Visit. At 
this visit, all investigations in cluding laboratory tests should be performed to allow the 
patient to be included in both safety and efficacy evaluations. This Termination Visit is 
identical to the follow -up visit of the last CUTAQUIG  administration.  
4.3.2  Patient  Replacement Policy

Page  48 of 87 4.4 Assignment of Patients to Treatment Groups  
This is an open -label non -randomized study. Patients will be enrolled into Cohort  1, 2, 
or 3 according to Investigator and patient preference.  However, patients entering the 
study already established on an every other week infusion schedule of another SCIG 
product may only participate in Cohort  1 or Cohort  2. 
All study sites will be permitted  to enroll patients in open cohorts . The Sponsor will 
notify study sites when a cohort has filled and is no longer open to recruitment . 
Patients will not be allowed to switch cohorts during the study .  
Patients who enter and participate in one cohort may not enter another cohort  at a later 
time.  
4.5 Relevant Pro tocol Deviations  
In case of any major protocol deviation, the Investigator and Octapharma will decide 
on the further participation of the patient  in this study after having discussed all relevant 
aspects.  
A list of all included patients with all deviations from the intended study procedures and 
other criteria that may affect the validity of patient data for statistical analysis will be 
prepared after the clinical phase of the study is completed. The list will be discussed 
by a panel consisting of the clinical study manager, a medical expert of the Sponsor, 
the data manager and the study statistician. This panel will decide upon the inclusion 
of each patient in the analysis populations  prior to database lock . 
4.6 Subsequent Therapy  
After a patient compl etes the study, or i f a patient decides to withdraw from the study 
or is withdrawn by the Investigator, he/she may be switched back to the treatment that 
he/she received before participation in the study or to another commercially available 
IVIG or SCIG  product , per treating physician discretion.

5.1 Characterization of Investigational Product(s)  
Name of Medicinal Product:  CUTAQUIG  
Active ingredient of CUTAQUIG : Human normal immunoglobulin  
Table 5: Biochemical Characteristics of CUTAQUIG  
Name of Ingredient  Amount  
Total protein (of which ≥96% is human IgG)  150 – 180 mg per mL  
Maltose  70 – 90 mg per mL  
Octoxynol  ≤5 µg per mL  
TNBP  ≤1 µg per mL  
IgA ≤0.6 mg per mL  
Polysorbate 80  10 – 60 µg per mL  
pH 5.0 – 5.8 
Osmolality  310 – 380 mosmol/kg  
Polymers + Aggregates  ≤5% of the total chromatogram area  
Monomers + Dimers  ≥90% of the total chromatogram area  
Fragments  ≤5% of the total chromatogram area  
Sodium  ≤30 mmol/L  
Each batch (lot) of CUTAQUIG  is prepared from at least 3,500  donations of human 
fresh frozen plasma. Effective viral reduction is obtained via a combination of 
3 validated manufacturing steps: cold -ethanol fractionation, solvent/detergent 
treatment with TN BP and Octoxynol, and pH  4 treatment. The manufacture of 
CUTAQUIG  is based on the Octagam manufacturing process including an additional 
adsorption step onto commercially available and widely used chromatography column 
for the removal of coagulation factor  XI. The process is identical up to the step of 
diafiltration. After this step the product solution is concentrated to a target 
concentration of 200  g/L. Polysorbate  80 and maltose are added during final 
formulation to final concentrations of 10  µg/mL to 60  µg/mL and 70  mg/mL to 
90 mg/mL, respectively.  
5.2 Packaging and Labelling  
CUTAQUIG  is delivered in 12  mL or 48  mL single -use glass vials. Each CUTAQUIG  
vial will be labeled in accordance with national regulations . Sample labels will be 
provided and filed with  the Investigational Product File at each investigator site and in 
the Sponsor TMF.  
5.3 Conditions for Storage and Use  
CUTAQUIG  must be stored and transported light -protected at 36°F to 46°F (2°C to 
8°C).  
CUTAQUIG  must not be frozen.  
CUTAQUIG  vials must not be  shaken.

Page  50 of 87 CUTAQUIG  must not be used after its expiration date.  
CUTAQUIG  must not be mixed with other medicinal products.  
Authorized personnel at the individual study centers will ensure that the IMP is stored 
in appropriate conditions in a secure refrigerat or with restricted access and in 
compliance with national regulations.  
5.4 Dose and Dosing Schedule  
CUTAQUIG  will be administered by subcutaneous infusion either every week 
(±2 days) or every other  week (±2  days) at double the weekly dose. The dosing 
frequency will be determined by the cohort assignment ( Section  3.3.2 ). 
A minimum interval of 4  days must be observed between 2  single subcutaneous 
infusions . 
Patients will receive the same mg/kg body weight dose as their previous SCIG product 
prior to study en try that will be  calculated at Screening. The d ose (mg/kg)  will be 
calculated by taking a patient’s total dose in milligrams  (mg) of their prior SCIG and 
dividing by the patient’s weight (kg)  at the Screening Visit . This will provide the 
milligrams of CUTA QUIG  required. Study site personnel will use dose calculation 
worksheets provided by the Sponsor to determine each patient’s  required quantity  
(mg) of CUTAQUIG.  
If, during the study, body weight changes by >5%  from the first infusion of IMP , the 
dose will be adjusted to keep a constant mg/kg body weight basis.  Additional 
adjustments will be made  by the Investigator at study visits  if the patient’s body weight 
changes >5% from the previous adjusted weight. In addition, individual patient doses 
may be titrate d up or down, per Investigator discretion . 
CUTAQUIG  infusions will be administered at the clinic and will be self -administered at 
home in between scheduled site visits.  
Each study visit may deviate from the planned date; however, the deviations must not 
cumulate. Study visit weeks and time windows are presented in Table 7. 
An individual patient’s CUTAQUIG  dose may be adjusted, if considered necessary by 
the Investigator, by titrating upward or downward; this dose adjustment should be 
based on the difference be tween the patient’s measured serum total IgG trough levels 
while on CUTAQUIG  and each patient's target serum total IgG trough level.   
5.5 Preparation and Method of Administration  
CUTAQUIG  vials must be allowed to warm to room or body temperature before 
infusio n. 
After CUTAQUIG  vials have been brought to room or body temperature, they should 
be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. 
The solution should be clear or slightly opalescent. DO NOT USE IF TURBID and/or 
DISC OLORATION IS OBSERVED. Solutions that are cloudy or vials that have a 
deposit must not be used and must be returned to the clinical site by the patient .

Page  51 of 87 CUTAQUIG  will be delivered by subcutaneous infusion using syringe drivers in order 
to deliver the proto col-specified infusion rate.  
The correct amount of IgG will be transferred from the 12  mL or 48  mL vials into 
syringes that are suitable for use with the selected syringe driver . 
Used , partially used vials from home infusions must be returned to the study site; all 
used and partially used vials must be discarded according to local policies and 
procedures.   
Any vials returned to the site  by the patient , due to deficiency in  vial us e or complaint 
regarding the drug or vials, must be retained by the study site  and must not be 
destroyed. The  study site must notify Octapharma  and retain the vials  on-site until 
arrangement s are made for them to be returned to Octapharma .  
Aseptic techniques must be used throughout the infusion pro cedure.  
As appropriate based on cohort assignment , syringe drivers , syringes , and standard 
infusion materials will be provided by the site for in -home infusions. The patient, his/her 
relative, and/ or caregiver will be instructed in the use of the followin g: 
• syringe driver  
• infusion techniques  
• patient diary completion  
• measures to be taken in case of severe AEs  
At the Stabilization Period Week  0 Visit and the Treatment Period Baseline Visit , 
patients will perform the infusions  at the study site  and will be as sessed for proper 
infusion technique. Patients will be re-trained on proper technique , if necessary .  
5.5.1  Infusion Sites 
No more than 6  infusion sites should be used simultaneously . 
Infusion sites should be at least 2  inches (approximately 5  cm) apart.  
The ana tomical location of infusion sites may be changed with weekly or every other 
week  administration as necessary.  
5.5.2  Infusion Volume  
The maximum infusion volume is 100 mL per infusion site.  
5.5.3  Infusion Flow Rates 
• The maximum recommended flow rate is 100 mL/hr/infusion site.  
• The maximum infusion rate for all sites combined is 240  mL/hr.  
• Infusion volumes and flow rates may only be increased if the previous 
2 administrations were tolerated by the patient , and deemed a ppropriate by the 
Investigator .  
• Infusion volume and flow rate should be increased gradually as tolerated to 
prevent infusion site reactions. See the parameters listed in Table 6.

Note: To account for non -precision flow rates of pumps, actual flow rate increases will be dependent on tubing size, number of 
infusion sites , and needle gauge. Minor deviations in flow rates (<2  mL/site) would not be considered protocol deviations.  
Instructions for performing volume increases in Cohort  1 patients who are using 
2 infusions sites with a total volume of ≥50 mL are provided in Section 3.3.2 . 
If AEs occur during an infusion, the flow rate and volume may be reduced if deemed 
necessary by the Investigator and/or patient to the previous flow rate and volume at 
which no AE occurred. If appropriate, the infusion may be interrupted until symptoms 
subside. The infusion may then be resumed at a flow rate or volume tolerated by the 
patient.  
5.6 Blinding, Emergency Envelopes, and Bre aking the Study Blind  
Not applicable  for this open -label study . 
5.7 Treatment Compliance  
5.7.1  Drug Dispensing and Accountability  
Any IMP provided to the site will be accounted for. This in cludes IMP received at the 
site and  IMP dispensed to patients.  A Drug Inventory and Dispensing Log will be kept 
current by the Investigator, detailing the dates and quantities of IMP received and 
dispensed to each patient  and the remaining quantity.  
Sponsor or designee will deliver CUTAQUI G to the participating Investigator sites . 
Each Investigator will keep current drug inventory and dispensing log, detailing the 
dates, batch (lot) numbers, and quantities of IMP received and dispensed to each 
patient and the remaining quantity . A packet co ntaining IMP Release, Confirmation of 
receipt, transport temperature log , and signed packing slip should be made available 
for the study monitor to review.  
The inventory and drug dispensing log will be available to the monitor to verify drug 
accountability  during the study. The study monitor will review all empty and partially 
used vials of IMP and will cross -check versus the patient source documentation 
(records), eCRF, and drug dispensing log.  
After this check, and after the Sponsor has granted written ap proval of destruction, 
empty or partially used vials should be destroyed at the study site following local 
policies. The destruction must be documented.  
For home treatments, a sufficient number of CUTAQUIG  vials will be dispensed  to 
each  patient. The Inves tigator or his/her designee will document the date, vial 
quantities , and batch (lot) number(s) of IMP dispensed to a given patient (using the 
corresponding patient number ). Patients will be instructed  to return used  or expired

Page  53 of 87 vials to the study site at th eir on -site visits, and to return all used and unused vials at 
the (Early) Termination  Visit.  
Patient -returned IMP (used or unused) must not be re-dispensed and must be 
destroyed after completion of drug accountability.  
5.7.2  Assessment of Treatment Compliance  
Patients will receive infusions at the clinic and at home (administered by the patient , 
his/her relative , or caregiver). Infusion details will be documented together with the 
batch number(s) in the eCRF.  
Throughout the study, patients will be as ked to document on a diary the date, batch 
(lot) numbers, number of vials, speed of infusion, infusion  site(s), occurrence of 
infections, TEAEs and local tissue reactions at infusion sites, missed days from work

Table 2 Cohort 1 (Increased Flow Volume) – Flow Chart of Assessments  
Table 3 Cohort 2 ( Increased Infusion Rate) – Flow Chart of Assessments  
Table 4 Cohort 3 ( Every Other Week Dosing) – Flow Chart of Assessments  
Descriptions of the assessments and methods performed at study visits are provid ed 
in Section  7. 
Descriptions of visit windows are provided in  Table 7. 
6.1.1  Screening Visit  
Study -related procedures will begin only after written informed consent (and assent, if 
appropriate) has been obtained from the patient and/or their legal guardians.  
Note:  Patients who participated in Study SC GAM -03 must receive their final infusion 
of CUTAQUIG for Study SCGAM -03 prior to  being consented for Study SCGAM -06. 
At the Screening Visit the following activities will be performed:  
• Written (signed and dated) informed consent (and assent, if age appropri ate) 
• Check of inclusion and exclusion criteria  
• Record demographic data  
• Document medical history  
• Record previous drug and non -drug therapies  
• General physical examination, including body weight and vital signs  
• Draw blood samples for total IgG trough level 
• Draw blood samples for safety laboratory parameters  
• Collect urine sample including sample for urine pregnancy test (females of 
childbearing potential, only)  
• Infusion  by the patient of their personal, commercially available SCIG product 
at the same bo dy-weight dependent dose  (mg/kg)  and infusion flow rate 
(ml/hr/site) as their previous infusions; however , this flow rate should  not to 
exceed maximum infusion rates listed in protocol  (Section  5.5.3 ). Patients who 
participated in Study SCGAM -03 will have already received a CUTAQUIG 
infusion on the same day prior to providing written informed consent (and 
assent, if appropriate)  for Study S CGAM -06. 
• Receive written approval from the  Sponsor , which will include confirmation that 
the chosen cohort is open for enrollment, prior to entering the  patient into the 
Stabilization Period.  
It is anticipated that the patients will receive their first do se of CUTAQUIG  5 days to  
16 days after the Screening Visit , depending when their last infusion occurred .

Page  55 of 87 6.1.2  CUTAQUIG  Stabilization Period (Stabilization Period Week 0 through 
Stabilization Period Week  4) 
After completing the Screening Period and receiving written Sponsor Acknowledgment 
of the cohort assignment during the Treatment Period, patients will enter a 4 -week 
Stabilization Period  during which they will receive CUTAQUIG  infusions at the same 
body -weight dependent (mg/kg) dose and infusion flow rate (ml/hr/site) as their 
previous SCIG produc t; however , this flow rate should  not to exceed maximum infusion 
rates listed in protocol ( Section  5.5.3 ). 
Patients entering the study currently active and established on CUTAQUIG in Study 
SCGAM -03 will have already been stabilized on CUTAQUIG  and will skip the 
Stabilization Period to go directly into the Treatme nt Period.  Patients that completed 
the SCGAM -03 study and went on a commercial SCIG  product prior to entering 
SCGAM -06 are required to enter the Stabilization Period.   
Patients entering the study already established on every other week dosing for either 
Cohort  1 or Cohort  2 will be required to dose weekly beginning at the Stabilization 
Week 0.  
At Stabilization Period Week 0, the CUTAQUIG  administration will be performed on -
site. Otherwise, CUTAQUIG  will be administered at home (Section  3.3.2).  
The following activities will be performed before  the on -site CUTAQUIG  administration:  
• Record body weight  
• Collect vital  signs  
• Draw blood samples for  total IgG trough level  
• Draw blood samples for safety laboratory parameters  
• Draw blood for serum retention sample s 
• Update  medical history  
The following activities will be performed during or after  CUTAQUIG  administration  
• CUTAQUIG  infusion  by the patient at the same body -weight dependent (mg/kg) 
dose and infusion flow rate (ml/hr/site) as their previous SCIG produc t; however , 
this flow rate should  not to exceed maximum infusion rates listed in protocol  
(Section  5.5.3 ). 
• Assess patient infusion technique and , if necessary, re -train on proper 
administration   
• Assess for local infusion -site reactions  
The following activities will be performed  after CUTAQUIG  administration:  
• Assess for local infusion -site reactions  
• AE assessment and record any changes in concomitant medications use during 
the study visit  
• Dispense patient diary  
6.1.3  CUTAQUIG  Treatment Visits (Baseline [ Week  0] through Week  24) 
After completing the 4 -week Stabilization Period  (or Screening Visit for patients who 
are currently enrolled in Study SCGAM -03), patients will enter the Treatment Period

Cohort 2  Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 12 , and 24  
Cohort 3  Baseline, Weeks 4, 12, and 24  
For Cohort  1 and Cohort  2, if a patient has reached their maximum achievable volume  
or flow rate  per infusion site  at Week  12, they do not need to complete remaining 
interim (4 -week interval) on -site study visits  at Week  16 and Week  20. 
The following activities will be performed before  on-site CUTAQUIG  administration s: 
• General physical examination (See Table 2 [Cohort  1], Table 3 [Cohort  2], and 
Table 4 [Cohort  3] for assessment sch edules)  
• Record body weight (all visits)  
• Draw blood samples for total IgG trough level (See Table 9 for collection 
schedule)  
• Draw blood samples for safety laboratory parameters (See Table 9 for collection 
schedule)

enrolled in SCGAM -03 and did not participate in the Stabilization Period  
(Baseline Visit, only)  
• Collect urine sample including sample for urine pregnancy  test (females of 
childbearing potential, only) (See Table 9 for collection  schedule ) 
• Collect vital signs (all visits)  
• Complete QoL questionnaire (Bas eline Visit, only)  
The following activities will be performed during or after  CUTAQUIG  administration:  
• Collect patient diary. The Investigator will review diary entries and query  the 
patient about any AEs that may have occurred and any changes in concomita nt 
therapies (medication and non -drug therapy ). Any updates to concomitant 
medication  use and adverse events will be recorded. Relevant diary data will be 
transferred to the eCRF. Discrepancies between patient diary entries and eCRF 
entries must be explained by the Investigator.  
• Infusion of CUTAQUIG  by the patient , according to cohort assignme nt (every 
visit – see Section  3.3.2  for dosing information)  
• Assess patient infusion technique and, if necessary, re -train on proper 
administration  
The following activities will be performed  after CUTAQUIG  administration:  
• Assess for local infusion -site reactions (every visit, prior to discharging patient)  
• AE assessment and record any changes in concomitant medications use during 
the stu dy visit (every visit, prior to discharging the patient)

6.1.4  Termination Visit   
The Termination Visit must occur prior the patient receiving another IgG product. This 
visit will take place 1  week after the last infusion  for Cohort 1 and  Cohort 2, or 2 weeks 
after the last infusion for Cohort 3; however, these visits may occur  sooner if a patient 
withdraws early from the study or if the study is ended earlier by one of the events 
described in Section  6.2.3 . 
The Termination Visit will includ e the following assessments:  
• General physical examination  
• Collect vital signs  
• Draw blood samples for safety laboratory parameters  
• Draw blood for serum retention sample s  
• Draw blood samples for total IgG trough level  
• Collect u rine sample including sample for urine pregnancy test (females of 
childbearing potential, only)  
• Complete QoL questionnaire  
• Comp lete Subject Questionnaire  
• Collect and review patient diary as at the earlier visits (Section  6.1.2 ) and record 
any AEs and/or changes in concomita nt medication use  
• Assess for local infusion -site reactions  
After the Termination Visit, the clinical study is considered completed for the patient. 
No further study -related assessments will be performed, unless safety concerns 
(eg, ongoing AEs, newly -repor ted SAEs [Section  7.3.8.1 ]) require follow -up.

6.2 Duration of Study  
6.2.1  Planned Duration for an Individual Patient  
The duration for each patient  in the study will be approximately 30 to 32  weeks: 
approximately 1 to 2 week s in the Screening Period, 4  weeks in the Stabilization 
Period, 24  weeks in the Treatment Period, and 1  to 2 week s to Termination Visit . 
Patients ente ring the study established on weekly SCIG infusions will have a 1  week 
Screening Period. Patients entering the study established on every other week dosing 
will have a 2 week Screening Period.  
Patients entering the study currently active and  established on  SCGAM -03 CUTIQUIG 
will skip the 4  week Stabilization Period . 
6.2.2  Planned Duration for the Study as a Whole  
The study will be considered completed when all patients  have completed the 
Termination Visit. 
The estimated study  start (enrol lment of first patient) is the 3rd quarter  2019. 
Recruitment duration is expected to be approximately 18  months; therefore, the 
estimated study  completion  (last patient  last visit ) is anticipated in the 1st quarter  2021.  
6.2.3  Premature Termination of the Study  
Both the responsible Investigators and the Sponsor reserve the right to terminate the 
study at any time. Should this be necessary, study close -out procedures will be 
arranged on an individual site basis after review and consultation by both parties. In 
terminating the study, the Sponsor and the Investigator will ensure that adequate 
consideration is given to the protection of the patients' interests.  
Furthermore, the Investigator should promptly inform the IRB and provide a detailed 
written explanation. Pert inent regulatory authorities and IRBs will be informed in 
accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  
6.2.3.1  Early Termination of the Entire Clinical Study

7.1 Demographic and Baseline Information  
Demographic and baseline information  will be recorded during the Screening Visit . 
7.1.1  Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics  are sex, age, race and ethnic origin, height, 
weight , calculated BMI, and ABO Rhesus blood type . 
7.1.2  Medical History   
Medical history  (conditions and surgical treatment) will be obtained by patient 
interview.  Records of past diseases and treatments (e g, hospital discharge letters) will 
be obtained for the study files , if available.  Any untoward medical events that occur 
from the time/date of informed consent signature until the first Study SCGAM -06 
specified CUTAQUIG dose will be recorded as medical history.  
7.1.3  Prior and Concomitant Medication Use  
Prior and concomitant medications  and therapies  will be obtained by patient interview.  
See Section  4.2 for details  on prior and concomitant medication collections.  
7.1.4  Documentation of Previous SCIG Treatment and IgG Trough Levels  
Docume ntation of consistent or stable doses of SCIG treatment will be collected from 
patients’ medical records.  
Documentation of IgG trough levels will be collected from pre -study laboratory results  
obtained prior to enrollment ; 2 prior IgG trough levels are req uired within 1  year of 
Screening , with 1  trough level obtained within 3  months prior to  enrollment . If no prior 
IgG trough level is available within 3  months prior to Screening, the Screening IgG 
trough level may be used  as the 2nd reading . 
7.2 Efficacy Assessments  
To study the effectiveness of CUTAQUIG  to maintain total IgG trough levels when 
administered every other week , in the prevention of infections, and changes in patient 
QoL assessments , the following measurements wi ll be recorded and eff icacy 
parameters assessed, throughout the study:  
• Change in IgG trough levels when switched from every week to every other 
week administration (Cohort  3) (See Section 7.4.1 ) 
• Number of episodes of SBI, per person -year on treatment, along with type and 
severity of infection, and time to resolution  
• Number of episodes of any other infections (including acute sinusitis, 
exacerbation of chronic sinusitis, acute otitis media, a cute bronchitis, infectious 
diarrhea etc.), along with type and severity of infection, and time to resolution  
• Number of days of use and annual rate of antibiotics (oral, parenteral, oral plus 
parenteral, prophylactic and therapeutic), along with type and d osage of 
antibiotic

Page  61 of 87 • QoL assessments  (See Section 7.4.2 ) 
For data collection of bacterial infections , in addition to on -site AE assessment s, each 
patient will be provided with an individual diary to be completed by the patient during 
the home therapy time. The patient's diary will be checked for accuracy of the data by 
the Investigator and collected at each study visit. The data will be then t ransferred into 
the eCRF. A new diary will be handed out to the patient for the following period until 
the next infusion visit at the site.  
For the purpose of this study the following events will be considered as SBIs, to be 
included in the primary efficac y analysis:  
• Bacterial pneumonia  
• Bacteremia/sepsis

Notes t o Table 8: 
Items in bold are considered essential diagnostic features.  
a. Two of the following should be present to make the diagnosis of sepsis in adults: temperature >38°C 
oral/>39°C rectal or <36°C ora l or <37°C rectal; heart rate >90  beats/min; respiratory rate 
>20 breaths/min , or PaCO2 <32 mm Hg; WBC count >12,000/mm3, <4,000/mm3, or >10% immature 
(band) forms. For pediatric patients,  the definition  of sepsis  using  age-specific  criteria  as

Page  63 of 87 recommended  by the International  Consensus  Conference  on Pediatric  Sepsis  should  be 
employed .[26] 
b. Indwellin g catheter - or vascular access device -related blood -borne infections are not included 
because evidence is lacking that  these are preventable with IVIG replacement therapy. For patients 
without indwelling catheters or vascular access devices, a single blood culture positive for a 
pathogenic organism will meet the diagnostic criteria for bacteremia. Patients meeting criteri a for 
positive blood culture but without 2 or more of the sepsis criteria listed above will be classified as 
having bacteremia . 
c. A blood culture positive for growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitides, or 
Haemophilus influenzae, in combinati on with CSF leukocytosis and/or decrease in CSF glucose, 
can serve to confirm the diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis . 
d. For the diagnosis of pneumonia in adults, commonly at least 2  of the listed symptoms and/or signs 
should be present in conjunction with at least one laboratory and one imaging studies diagnostic 
element. However, for the purposes of counting serious bacterial infection episodes in a clinical trial 
of IVIG, the findin g of a new pulmonary infiltrate with consolidation on chest X -ray is considered 
sufficient. To establish the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia for pediatric patients, most of the same 
diagnostic criteria listed may be used, with the following exceptions: Be cause pediatric patients may 
not produce a sputum specimen for culture, blood cultures or serology may be substituted to identify 
the etiologic bacterial pathogen. In infants age 3  to 24  months, who tend to have a higher baseline 
temperature, fever is defi ned as a rectal temperature >38.3°C (101°F). In children >2 years, fever 
is more commonly defined as a rectal temperature >38°C (100.4°F). In pediatric patients, elevations 
of WBC counts >15,000/mm3 are frequent but could be variable in patients with bacte rial 
pneumonia, or leukopenia with WBC count <5000/mm3 may be observed, usually associated with 
severe infection . 
e. It is recommended to obtain a deep expectorated sputum gram stain to demonstrate the presence 
of microorganisms on examination of 10 -20 oil im mersion microscopic fields and <10  squamous 
epithelial cells and >25  polymorphonuclear leukocytes at 10X low power magnification to determine 
suitability of sputum culture.  
7.3 Safety Assessments  
The following safety assessments shall be collected:  
• Adverse eve nts (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) temporally 
associated with the administration of IMP (for definitions and reporting 
requirements, see Section  7.3.1  for AEs and Section  7.3.3  for SAEs)  
• Pregnancies (Section  7.3.8.2 ) 
7.3.1  Adverse Events  
7.3.1.1  Definitions  
Adverse event (AE):  An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study patient 
receiving an IMP and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory findin g), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use 
of an IMP, whether or not related to the IMP.  
An AE is defined as treatment -emergent (TEAE)  if the event began or worsened after 
the start of first infusion of trial medication. For patients in thi s study, “treatment -
emergent” will refer to events with onset date/time after the start of the first CUTAQUIG  
infusion at the Stabilization Period Week 0 Visit.  
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol No . SCGAM -06 Version 02 CONFIDENTIAL  28-Aug-2019  
 
Page  64 of 87 Adverse drug reaction (ADR):  An ADR is any noxious and unintended response to an 
IMP related to  any dose. The phrase “response to an IMP” means that a causal 
relationship  between the IMP and an AE carries at least a reasonable possibility (ie,  the 
relationship cannot be ruled out).  
Other Significant AEs:  Any non -serious AE or marked laboratory abnor mality that 
results in:  
• withdrawal of IMP treatment  
• and/or dose reduction  
• and/or initiation of significant additional concomitant therapy (ie,  medications 
given intravenously)  
Withdrawal due to AE/ADR:  AE/ADR leading to discontinuation of treatment with IM P. 
Any such events will be followed up by the Investigator until the event is resolved or 
until the medical condition of the patient is stable. All follow -up information collected 
will be made available to the Sponsor.  
7.3.1.2  Collection  
The condition of the patient will be monitored throughout the study. At each visit, 
whether scheduled or unscheduled, AEs will be elicited using a standard non -leading 
question such as “How have you been since the last visit/during the previous study 
period?” In addition, pati ent diaries (if applicable) will be checked by the Investigator 
for any documented event.  
Any AE which occurs during the study from the time/date of first dose of CUTAQUIG 
through the Termination Visit will be noted in detail on the appropriate pages of th e 
eCRF. Any untoward medical events that occur from the time/date of informed consent 
signature until the first CUTAQUIG dose will be recorded as medical history. If the 
patient reports several signs or symptoms representing one syndrome or diagnosis, 
the diagnosis should be recorded in the eCRF. The Investigator will grade the severity 
of all AEs (mild, moderate or severe), the seriousness (non -serious or serious), and 
causality, as defined below (Section  7.3.1.3 , Section  7.3.3 , and Section  7.3.1.4 , 
respectively). The Sponsor is also responsible to assess the expectedness of each 
ADR (expected or unexpected), as defined below (Section  7.3.1.5 ). 
In the event of clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings, the tests will be 
confirmed and followed -up until they have returned  to normal and/or an adequate 
explanation is available.  
Diseases, signs and symptoms and/or laboratory abnormalities already existing before 
the first administration of IMP are not considered as AEs when observed at a later 
stage unless they represent an e xacerbation in intensity or frequency (worsening).  
The Investigator should always provide detailed information concerning any 
abnormalities and the nature of, and reasons for, any necessary action(s), as well as 
any other observations or comments which are  useful for the interpretation and 
understanding of patients’ AEs.

Page  65 of 87 7.3.1.3  Severity  
The intensity/severity of AEs will be graded as follows:  
• Mild:  an AE, usually transient, which causes discomfort but does not interfere 
with the patient’s routine activities  
• Modera te: an AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with the 
patient’s routine activities  
• Severe:  an AE which is incapacitating and prevents the pursuit of the patient’s 
routine activities  
The severity grading of an AE is up to the medical judgement  of the Investigator and 
will be decided on a case -by-case basis.  
7.3.1.4  Causality  
The relationship of AEs to the administered IMP will be assessed by the Investigator : 
• Probable:  reports including good reasons and sufficient documentation to 
assume a causal relat ionship, in the sense of plausible, conceivable, likely, but 
not necessarily highly probable. A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the IMP; or that follows a known or expected 
response pattern to the suspected medic ine; or that is confirmed by stopping or 
reducing the dosage of the medicine and that could not reasonably be explained 
by known characteristics of the patient’s clinical state.  
• Possible:  reports containing sufficient information to accept the possibility of a 
causal relationship, in the sense of not impossible and not unlikely, although the 
connection is uncertain or doubtful, for example because of missing data or 
insufficient evidence. A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence 
from administr ation of the IMP; that follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the suspected medicine; but that could readily have been produced 
by a number of other factors  
• Unlikely:  reports not following a reasonable temporal sequence from IMP 
administration. An  event which may have been produced by the patient’s clinical 
state or by environmental factors or other therapies administered.  
• Not related (unrelated):  events for which sufficient information exists to 
conclude that the etiology is unrelated to the IMP.  
• Unclassified:  reports which for one reason or another are not yet assessable, 
eg, because of outstanding information (can only be a temporary assessment).  
Sites are encouraged not to use this category unless necessary, as it will be 
assumed there is a caus al relationship and may lead to premature fulfillment of 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S USAR ) criteria.  
7.3.1.5  Classification of ADRs by Expectedness  
ADRs will be classified by the Sponsor as either expected or unexpected : 
• Expected:  an ADR that i s listed in the current edition of the Investigator’s 
Brochure or other reference safety information.

Page  66 of 87 • Unexpected:  an ADR that is not listed in the current edition of the Investigator’s 
Brochure or other reference safety information, or that differs because  of greater 
severity or greater specificity.  
7.3.1.6  Outcome of AEs  
Outcome of all reported AEs will be documented as follows : 
• Recovered, resolved  
• Recovering, resolving  
• Not recovered, not resolved  
• Recovered, resolved with sequelae  
• Fatal  
• Unknown  
NOTE:  A patient’s death  per se is not an event, but an outcome. The event which 
resulted in the patient’s death must be fully documented and reported, even in case 
the death occurs within 4  weeks after IMP treatment end and regardless of whether or 
not it is co nsidered treatment -related.  
7.3.1.7  Action(s) taken  
AEs requiring action or therapy must be treated with recognized standards of medical 
care to protect the health and well -being of the patient. Appropriate resuscitation 
equipment and medicines must be available t o ensure the best possible treatment in 
an emergency situation.  
The action taken by the Investigator must be documented:  
a) General actions taken in the event of an AE  
– None  
– Medication (other than IMP) or other (eg, physical) therapy started  
– Test performed  
– Other (to be specified)  
b) IMP-related actions taken in the event of an AE  
– None  
– Product withdrawn  
– Dose reduced  
– Dose increased  
The Investigator will follow up on each AE until it has resolved or until the medical 
condition of the patient is stable, and all releva nt follow -up information will be reported 
to the Sponsor.  
7.3.2  Local Site Reactions  
Local infusion -site reactions will be assessed by both patients and investigators.  
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol No . SCGAM -06 Version 02 CONFIDENTIAL  28-Aug-2019  
 
Page  67 of 87 Patients will grade the overall perception of local reactions in their diaries after each 
infusion using a 4 -point rating scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe.  
Investigators will evaluate local reactions after infusion at every study visit, using a 
4-point rating scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe.  
The following observations mus t not be reported as local infusion site reactions as all 
of these can be expected in all patients:  
• Local mass (usually reported as "swelling") caused by the injected CUTAQUIG  
volume  
• Small blood drops at the infusion site caused by the needle sticks  
• Short and immediate pain at the infusion site caused by the puncture itself  
Any other local infusion site reactions such as redness, pain (other than the pain 
caused by the puncture itself), pruritus, rash or other skin reactions, bleedings (other 
than sma ll blood drops caused by the needle stick), local thrombosis, induration or 
swellings (caused by other grounds than the injected volume) must be reported on the 
adverse events page in the eCRF.  
7.3.3  Serious Adverse Events  
A serious AE (SAE)  is any untoward medi cal occurrence that at any dose : 
• results in death  
• is life -threatening (see below)  
• requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is anothe r important medical event  
NOTE:  The term ‘life -threatening’ refers to an event in which the patient was, in the 
view of the reporting Investigator, at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not refer to an event which may hypothetically have caused death had it been 
more severe . 
Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an AE/ADR is serious in 
other situations: Important AEs/ADRs that are not immediately life -threatening or do 
not result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definitions above, should 
also be considered serious.  
In addition, although not classified under the seriousness criteria, all suspected 
transmissions of an infectious agent should be reported as SAE. A suspected virus 
transmission means that virus antigen has been detected in the patient. A passive 
transmission of antibodies alone does not constitute a suspected virus transmission.

Page  68 of 87 7.3.3.1  SAE Reporting  
All SAEs, whether or not they are suspected to be related to study treatment, are to be 
reported immediately to the Octapharma Project Manager by email and 
to . 
In addition,  within  24 hours  after recognition  of the event,  an Octapharma  Serious 
Adverse  Event  Report  must  be completed  and submitted  to: 
Octapharma’s Corporate Drug Safety Unit  
OCTAPHARMA Pharmazeutika Produktionsges.m.b.H.  
Oberlaaer Strasse 235, 1100 Vienna, Austria  
 
 
 
SAE reporting procedures are outlined in the Site Safety Reporting Manual that will be 
provided to each site and will be communicated at the site initiation visit.  
Waivers from the SAE Reporting Requirement  
Waivers from the SAE reporting requirement include surgeries that are elective or were 
planned before study entry or prolongations of existing hospitalizations for economic 
or social, but not medical, reasons. Such surgeries or prolon gations of hospitalizations 
should not be considered SAEs.  In addition, any AE that meets the criteria of an SAE 
but begins prior to the start of the first infusion will be waived from the SAE reporting 
requirements .  
7.3.4  Laboratory Tests  
The following laborat ory tests will be performed during the course of the study to 
investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of CUTAQUIG  (Table 9). At each visit, 
laboratory tests will be performed before CUTAQUIG  infusions at the study site.   
The following laboratory parameters will be investigated during the study at the time 
points specified in the FLOW CHARTS OF ASSESSMENTS .

7.3.5  Serum Retention Samples  
Serum retention samples  will be collected at Stabilization Period Week  0 for 
CUTAQUIG -naïve patients  or SCGAM -03 patie nts that have gone on a commercial 
SCIG  product , at Treatment Period Baseline for patients who are enrolled in 
SCGAM -03 and directly entering SCGAM -06, and at the Termination Visit for all 
patients  (Table 9). These samples will be shipped to a central laboratory for retention  
and possible future testing of Hepatitis A, B, C , and HIV I/II.  Instructions for sample 
handling will be provided in the Study Laboratory Manual.   
7.3.6  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured at the time points specified in the FLOW CHARTS OF 
ASSESSMENTS  and include blood pressure, body temperature, pulse, and respiratory 
rate. 
7.3.7  Physical Examination including Height and Weight  
Physical examinations will be performed according to each study sit e’s routine 
procedures by study personnel who are qualified to perform such evaluations. These 
examinations will be as comprehensive as necessary to detect relevant somatic or 
neurological diseases. If any findings are abnormal, the Investigator will docum ent the 
start date and whether or not the abnormal finding is still present at the start of 
treatment.

Page  70 of 87 Both height and weight will be measured at Screening. In addition, weight will be 
measured at all visits prior to dosing in order to allow for dose calcu lations.  
7.3.8  Other Relevant Safety Information  
7.3.8.1  Post -study related safety reports  
Any SAE which occurs up to 4 weeks after the Termination Visit  should be reported by 
the Investigator to the Sponsor in case the Investigator becomes aware of it. Proactive 
monito ring for post -study SAEs is not required.  
If a post -study SAE is identified, the Investigator should complete an SAE form and 
also record the relationship of the SAE to the IMP in the SAE report.  
Any death occurring within 4 weeks after Termination Visit should also be reported, 
regardless of whether or not it is considered treatment -related.  
7.3.8.2  Pregnancies  
Every effort will be made to avoid a pregnancy during the use of an IMP. Pregnancies 
occurring  during the study (fetal exposure to the IMP) need to be reported.  
In case of a pregnancy during the study, the Investigator should complete the 
Pregnancy Notification Form and email  or fax it to the Sponsor’s representative 
(Section  7.3.3.1 ). 
7.3.8.3  Drug overdose, interaction, or medication error  
The following safety relevant information should be reported as AE or as an SAE if the 
reaction fulfils one of the criteria for seriousness ( Section  7.3.3 ). 
a) Drug overdose  
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose 
higher than specified in the protocol and higher than the known therapeutic dose that 
is of clinical relevance. The reaction must be clearly identified as an overdose.  
b) Drug interaction  
A drug interaction is a situation in which a substance or medicinal pro duct affects the 
activity of an IMP, ie, increases or decreases its effects, or produces an effect that 
none of the products would exhibit on its own. The reaction must be clearly identified 
as a drug interaction.  
c) Medication error  
A medication error involv es the inadvertent administration or unintended use of a 
medicinal product which may be caused by the naming, presentation of 
pharmaceutical form/packaging, or instructions for use/labelling.  The reaction must be 
clearly identified as a medication error.

Page  71 of 87 7.4 Other Assessments  
7.4.1  Drug Concentration Measurements (IgG Trough Levels ) 
Samples for total IgG trough levels measurements will be taken at the Screening Visit, 
before any infusion given at the study site ( Section  7.1.4 ), and at the (Early) 
Termination Visit ( Table 9). 
7.4.2  Quality of Life Assessment  
QoL as sessments will be made using the SF-10 from a parent or guardian of patients 
<14 years of age and the SF -36 Health Survey in patients  ≥14 years of age. The QoL 
assessments will take place at  the Treatment Period Baseline  Visit and at the ( Early) 
Termination Visit.   
7.4.3  Subject Questionnaire  
The Subject Questionnaire will be completed asking for their opinions related to their 
participation on the trial. This will be completed by all patients ( or with the assistance 
of a parent/guardian for children , when applicable) at the (Early) T ermination Visit. 
7.5 Appropriateness of Measurements  
Safety will be monitored by standard assessments including monitoring AEs, local 
infusion site reactions, vital signs, laboratory safety tests, and physical examinations.  
Therapeutic efficacy, defined as the prevention of SBI, is a very important clinical 
aspect of any IgG replacement therapy and best characterizes benefit to the patient.  
Determination of the pre -next-dose trough level of IgG is a standard method for 
determination of the correct dose for the individual patient.  
The QoL questionnaires  are standardized, validated instrument s that ha ve been widely 
used in clinical studies, including studies with PI patients.

Page  72 of 87 8 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
To ensure tha t data in the eCRFs are accurate and complete and in accordance with 
source records, source data verification will be performed in accordance with 
Octapharma standards. The extent of source data verification will be defined in detail 
in the monitoring manu al. 
8.1 Documentation of Data  
8.1.1  Source Data and Records  
Source data are defined as all information related to clinical findings, observations, or 
other activities in the study ; written down in original records or certified copies of 
original records; or electronic medical records; allowing reconstruction and evaluation 
of the clinical study.  
The Investigator will maintain adequate source records (e g, case histories or patient 
files) for each patient enrolled. Source records should be preserved for the maximum 
period of time required by local regulations.  
For each patient enrolled, the Investigator will indicate in the source record(s) that the 
patient participates in this study.  
All data entered in the  eCRF  must be supported by source data in the patient records, 
with exceptions listed in Section  8.1.2 . 
The Investigator wil l permit study -related monitoring, audit(s), IEC/IRB review(s), and 
regulatory inspection(s), by providing direct access to the source data/records.  
The Investigator may authorize site staff (e g, sub-Investigator s, research nurses) to 
enter study data into  the eCRF . This must be documented in the Delegation of 
Authority Log  and signed by the Investigator.  
The following data must be verifiable from the source records: patient number, sex, 
weight, date of birth, written informed consent  (and assent, if approp riate) , medical 
history, main inclusion and exclusion criteria, local laboratory test results, PID -relevant 
concomitant therapies (medication and non -drug therapy), any AE occurring in the 
course of the study, details of infusions (batch number, number of vials used, date, 
dose, rate , and infusion site(s)), date and reason for early termination  (if applicable). 
As part of the source records, laboratory data will be reviewed by the Investigator, 
assessed as to their clinical significance, signed , and dated . 
8.1.2  Electronic Case Report Forms  
For each patient enrolled, an eCRF will be completed within the EDC system and 
approved by the Investigator or an authorized sub -Investigator .  
Study site staff ( eg, research nurse) will be responsible for entering patient data into 
the validated EDC system. All site personnel will be trained on the EDC system and 
study specific eCRF before receiving access to the live database for data entry.  
The site will be  provide d with approved eCRF Completion Guidelines which will assist 
in data entry and data issues/questions. The site will be notified once the database is 
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol No . SCGAM -06 Version 02 CONFIDENTIAL  28-Aug-2019  
 
Page  73 of 87 active to begin data entry. Additional site training may be provided as refreshers 
throughout the study, if  needed. All persons allowed to enter or change eCRF data 
must be listed in the Delegation of Authority Log.  
If any errors in the eCRFs are found during the data review process, discrepancies will 
be generated programmatically within the EDC system and man ual queries will be 
generated by either a monitor or Data Management. The programmed edit checks fire 
automatically once an eCRF page is saved within the system. The outputs of the 
programmed checks are referred to as discrepancies. Discrepancies are gener ated by 
the input of illogical eCRF data with the purpose to clarify the context or insertion of 
illogical or missing data with the site or designee.  
All discrepancies (programmed and manual) will be submitted to the site personnel or 
monitor for the site within the EDC system. Once the site responds to a discrepancy, 
Data Management or the monitor will review the new or changed data to ensure an 
appropriate response and close the discrepancy within the system.  
8.1.3  Changes to Electronic Case Report Form Data  
Monitors will perform source data verification (SDV) as defined for the study.  
Errors occurring in the EDC system can only be corrected by the Investigator(s) or 
authorized site personnel. An audit trail documents all changes to the data over the 
entire stud y period. If data are changed as a result of a query, a comment must be 
entered stating the reason for the change before closing the query. In addition, any 
change to a previously saved eCRF page that has not had a query generated will need 
to have a reaso n specified for the data change.  
Once queries have been resolved by the site staff, the resolutions are assessed by 
Data Management. If the query response provided confirms the data as correct, the 
discrepancy will be closed. If the response does not adequ ately address the question 
raised, a new query will be issued for further clarification.  
Manual checks will be performed, and programs will be run throughout the study until 
the data are clean (all discrepancies resolved) and the database is ready for lock . 
Source data verification will be confirmed as complete by the monitor and all eCRFs 
will be approved by the Investigator before database lock.  
8.2 Information to Investigators  
An Investigator’s Brochure will be provided  to the Investigator before the start o f the 
study. This brochure contains all information in the Sponsor’s possession necessary 
for the Investigator to be fully and accurately informed about the safety of the IMP 
under evaluation and the respective benefit -risk ratio.  
The Investigator’s Brochure will be updated by the Sponsor at regular intervals and the 
event that relevant  new information concerning the IMP becomes available.  
All participating investigators will be informed about relevant study procedures, about 
the me thods for rating relevant study outcomes , and how to enter data into  the eCRF 
in order to reduce discrepancies. At the study  initiation visit, the eCRF will be explained 
to all study site staff entitled to document data in the eCRF.

Page  74 of 87 Investigator s will be k ept informed of important information related to the safe use of 
the IMP as the study proceeds.  
8.3 Responsibilities  
The Principal Investigator is accountable for the conduct of the clinical study at each 
study site.  Responsibilities may be delegated to approp riately qualified persons.  
A Delegation of Authority Log will be completed  and signed by the Principal 
Investigator. In accordance with this authority log, study site staff (e g, sub-
Investigator s, study coordinators, nurses) will be  authorized to perform s pecific tasks 
relating to study  conduct.  
At each study site, the Investigator is responsible for maintaining all records to enable 
the conduct of the study to be fully documented. Essential documents as required by 
Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) guidelines a nd regulations (e g, copies of the protocol, 
study approval letters, all original informed consent forms  and assent forms (as age 
appropriate) , site copies of all  eCRF s, drug dispensing and accountability logs, 
correspondence pertaining to the study) should  be filed accurately and retained  by the 
Investigator for the maximum period of time required by local regulations.  
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining a confidential patient  identification code 
list which provides the unique link between named source records and  eCRF  data for 
the Sponsor. The Investigator must arrange for the retention of this confidential list for 
the maximum period of time required by local regulations.  
No study document should be destroyed without prior written agreement between the 
Investigator and the Sponsor. Should the Investigator elect to assign the study 
documents to another party or move them to another location, the Sponsor must be 
notified in writ ing. 
8.4 Provision of Additional Information  
On request, the Investigator will supply the Sponsor with additional data relating to the 
study or copies of relevant source records ; the Investigator must  ensur e that patient 
confidentiality is maintained  on any so urce documents provided to the Sponsor . This 
is particularly important when source data are illegible or when errors in data 
transcription are encountered.  
In the event of  particular issues or governmental queries, it may also be necessary to 
have access t o the complete study records, provided that the patient’s confidentiality 
is protected in accordance with applicable regulations.  
8.5 Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
The Sponsor will establish an IDMC.  
The IDMC will be composed of recognized  experts in the field of immunology who  are 
not actively recruiting patients.  
During the study, the IDMC will periodically review relevant data and will give advice 
on the continuation, modification , or termination of the study (Section  6.2.3 ). A study -

Page  76 of 87 9 STATISTICAL METHODS AND SAMPLE SIZE  
Statistical analysis will  be delegated under an agreement of transfer of responsibilities 
to an external CRO. All Octapharma procedures and policies must be met by this CRO. 
Discrepancies or exceptions will be approved by the Sponsor's Manager of Biometrics.  
A formal statistical analysis plan describing all details of the analyses to be performed 
will be prepared by the study statistician and approved by the Sponsor prior to the start 
of the statistical analysis.  
9.1 Determination of Sample Size  
Approximately 65 patients w ho meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study : 
• At least  15 patients in Cohort 1  
• At least  15 patients in Cohort 2  
• At least  35 patients in Cohort 3  
The co -primary endpoints will be analyzed descriptively, and no formal sample size 
calculation wa s done for the overall number of patients enrolled.  
For Cohort 3 we plan for a confirmative analysis to evaluate whether the total IgG 
trough levels are maintained by an every other week dosing regimen; the following pair 
of hypotheses will be tested:  
Ha: Teow > Tw  – 1   vs.   H 0: Teow  ≤ T w - 1 
where T eow is the mean total IgG trough on steady -state dosing every other week, T w 
is the same for weekly dosing, and a maximum decrease of 1 g/L for the mean total 
IgG trough level is considered accep table.  
Tw will be determined after completion of the Stabilization Period, Teow at the final study 
visit. 
This one -sided hypothesis will be tested by a paired t -test at the alpha=2.5% level of 
significance. Assuming 3.0 for the standard deviation common to  both members of a 
pair, and 0.8 as the correlation between members of a pair, this results in a required 
minimum of 31  evaluable patient s to achieve a power of 80%.  
9.2 Statistical Analysis  
All data collected will be listed and presented descriptively in full detail, by cohort as 
well as in total, to facilitate comparison between the different dosing regimens . 
As detailed in Section  9.1, the change in total IgG trough levels when switching from 
weekly to bi -weekly infusions will be tested in Cohort  3 by means of a one -sided, paired 
t-test at the α=0.025 level of significance.  
Descriptive summaries will be presented for each of the primary and secondary 
variables according to their individual data types . The results of this study will be 
presented at the descriptive level only;  any additional p-value or confidence interval 
presented is to be understood in th e exploratory sense.

Page  77 of 87 9.2.1  Populations for Analysis  
The following populations will be considered for the statistical analysis:  
• Safety Analysis Set: all patients who received at least part of one infusion of 
CUTAQUIG . 
• Full Analysis Set (FAS): all patients in the Safety Analysis Set who satisfy all 
major eligibility criteria and for whom any post -baseline data is available (per 
intention -to-treat principle). This set of eligible patients will be used for 
measurement of treatment effects.  
• Per-Protocol (PP) Set: all patients in the FAS, excluding those with substantial  
protocol deviations which may have an impact on the analysis of the co -primary 
endpoint. This is the set of patients who participated in the study as intended 
and for whom the co -primary endpoint can be  evaluated as planned.  
Only substantial  protocol deviations with the potential to significantly affect the study 
results or to invalidate the interpretation of the data obtained will lead to exclusion of 
patients from the PP set; protocol deviations to be considered will include (but will not 
be limited to):  
• Violations of the study entry criteria  
• Administration of any other blood or plasma -derived product or of any other 
immunoglobulin preparations during Study SCGAM -06 
• Any prohibited concomitant medication  (including long term daily corticosteroid  
use of > 0.15 mg of prednisone or equivalent/kg/day [with the exception of short 
or intermittent courses as described in Section  4.2.2 ], immunosuppressive and 
immunomodulatory drugs)  
• Failure to attend two scheduled consecutive visits OR three or more scheduled 
visits during the study for reasons other than clinical reasons  
Efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the FAS. Safety endpoints will be analyzed 
using the Safety Analysis Set.  Selected analyses will be repeated for the PP population 
as detailed in the SAP and its appendices.  
In the event that a patient is not treate d according to the dosing regimen described for 
his assigned cohort, the original cohort assignment will still be used for safety and the 
ITT analyses (SAF and FAS populations). These patients will be removed from the PP 
population due to protocol violatio ns. 
The membership of each patient in the respective analysis populations will be 
determined before the statistical analysis in a data review meeting by a panel 
consisting of a medical expert from the Sponsor, the clinical study manager, the data 
manager a nd the study statistician.  
9.2.2  Efficacy Analysis Plan  
The rate of SBI per person -year (bacterial pneumonia, bacteremia/sepsis, 
osteomyelitis/septic arthritis, visceral abscess, bacterial meningitis) during the 
CUTAQUIG  treatment period will be presented as point estimates of the rate along 
with a 99% CI. Calc ulation of this confidence interval will account for intra -patient 
correlation in incidents following a compound Poisson process model. Furthermore, all 
observed SBIs will be listed individually and in full detail.

Page  78 of 87 The duration of infection will be summari zed by standard descriptive statistics by type 
of infection and by severity. The individual characteristics of each infection, including 
the time to resolution will be listed.  
The use of antibiotics will be reported as a detailed list of all such medicatio ns, and the 
number of patients treated with antibiotics, the number of treatment episodes and the 
number of treatment days will be tabulated.  
The US FDA Guidance for Industry on Safety, Efficacy, and Pharmacokinetic Studies 
to Support Marketing of Immune G lobulin Intravenous (Human) as Replacement 
Therapy for Primary Humoral Immunodeficiency  suggests that, based on historical 
data, a statistical demonstration of a serious  bacterial  infection rate per person -year 
less than  1.0 is adequate to provide substant ial evidence of efficacy. [25] Therefore, 
this background information will be used for a descriptive evaluation of the serious 
bacterial infection rate in this study  as described above . Exploratory statistical testing 
may be p erformed if considered appropriate.  
The QoL data will be presented descriptively by visit, along with the change from 
Baseline , defined as the Treatment Period Baseline  Visit.  
For Cohort  3, the change in total IgG trough levels when switching from weekly to every 
other week  infusions will be tested confirmatory by means of a one -sided, paired t -test 
at the α=0.025 level of significance. The following pair of hypotheses will be tested:  
Ha: Teow > T w – 1   vs.   H 0: Teow ≤ T w - 1 
where T eow is the mean total IgG trough on steady -state dosing every other week, T w 
is the same for weekly dosing, and a maximum decrease of 1 g/L for the mean total 
IgG trough level is considered acceptable.  
Tw will be determined after completion of the Stabilization Period, T eow at the final study 
visit. 
9.2.3  Safety Analysis Plan  
The safety analysis will comprise descriptive statistics, tabulations, and listings of all 
TEAEs, safety laboratory results, vital signs, and p hysical examination findings.  
9.2.3.1  Adverse Events  
All reported AEs will be coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities  (MedDRA ). 
An AE is defined as treatment -emergent if first onset or worsening is after start of the 
first infusion of CUTAQUIG . Only TEAEs are accounted for in the analysis.  
Any untoward medical events  that occur between informed consent and the start of 
the first infusion of CUTAQUIG  will be considered pre-treatment AEs.  These events  
will not be entered into the safety database as they are not TEAE.  
For each TEAE, the time relative to the start of the infusion will be calculated and the 
TEAE will be classified as temporally associated if the onset time is during the infusion 
or within 72  hours after the end of the  infusion.

Page  79 of 87 All reported AEs will be listed and tabulated in full detail, in particular the following data 
will be presented:  
• Total number of TEAEs reported  
• Number of TEAEs  
• Infusion rate at the onset of TEAEs  
• Narratives will be prepared describing each deat h, other SAEs, and other 
significant AEs that are judged to be of special interest because of clinical 
importance  
9.2.4  Handling of Missing Data  
In general, missing data will not be imputed: calculations pertaining to person -year 
computations will be based on ob served values only. Only in case of missing body 
weight will the last available weight measurement be used for calculating the dose per 
kg body weight (last observation carried forward [LOCF]).  
9.3 Randomization, Stratification, and Code Release  
There is no ra ndomization or stratification in this study.  Assignments to the 3  study 
cohorts will be based on patient  eligibility and Investigator and patient preference.

10.1 Ethical/Regulatory Framework  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their 
origins in the Declaration of Helsinki. Before submission of the study protocol to the 
IRB and Competent Authority, t he study will be registered in ClinicalTrials.gov. The 
study protocol and any subsequent substantial amendment(s), as well as a sample of 
the information sheet, informed consent form, assent form, any other materials 
provided to the patients, and further r equested information will be submitted to the IRB 
and the Competent Authority. The study will be conducted in compliance with the 
protocol, GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements.  
The study will be conducted under a US Investigational New Drug (IND ) application, 
and therefore must meet the applicable US FDA requirements including Statement of 
Investigator Form 1572 and financial disclosure statement.  
The regulatory application or submission for regulatory approval will be made by the 
Sponsor as requ ired by national law. Study approval must be available before any 
patient is exposed to a study -related procedure.  
The Competent Authorities and the IRBs will be notified of the end of the clinical study 
in accordance with local regulations.  
10.2 Approval of St udy Documents  
The study protocol, a sample of the patient information and informed consent form, 
assent form, and further requested information will be submitted to the appropriate IRB 
and the competent Authority. The study approval letter must be availabl e before any 
IMP may be shipped to the study sites and any patient is exposed to a study -related 
procedure.  
The Sponsor, the Investigator and any third party (eg, CRO) involved in obtaining 
approval, must inform each other in writing that all ethical and legal requirements have 
been met before the first patient is enrolled in the study.  
10.3 Patient Information and Informed Consent  
The Investigator will obtain freely given written consent from each patient after an 
appropriate explanation of the aim s, methods, anticipated benefits, potential hazards 
and any other aspect of the study which is relevant to the patient’s decision to 
participate. The informed consent form must be signed, with name, date, and time 
noted by the patient, before the patient i s exposed to any study -related procedure, 
including screening tests for eligibility.  
For patients not qualified to give legal consent, written consent must be obtained from 
the legal parent/guardian. If children are old enough to understand the risks and 
benefits of the study, they should also be informed and provide their written consent 
using an assent form.  
The Investigator will explain to each single patient that the patients are completely free 
to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw from it at any  time, without any

The Investigator will date and sign the informed consent form of each patient enrolled.  
Each patient (and legal guardian, as age appropriate) will give  written consent that 
his/her source records may be reviewed by study monitors, quality assurance auditors, 
and/or health authority inspectors, in accordance with applicable regulations. These 
persons are bound by confidentiality obligations.  
10.4 Protocol Amen dments  
Any prospective change to the protocol will be agreed between the Investigator 
(Coordinating Investigator in multicenter studies) and the Sponsor before its 
implementation. Any such amendments will be submitted to the IRB and/or Competent 
Authority responsible as required by applicable regulations. IRB approval will at a 
minimum be requested for any change to this protocol which could affect the safety of 
the patients, the objective/design of the study, any increase in dosage or duration of 
exposure to the IMP, an increase in the number of patients treated, the addition of a 
new test or procedure, or the dropping of a test intended to monitor safety.  
10.5 Confidentiality of Patient Data  
The Investigator will ensure that patient confidentiality is preserved . In eCRFs or any 
other documents submitted to the Sponsor, patients will not be identified by  name or 
initials  but by a unique patient identifier. Documents not intended for submission to the 
Sponsor, including but not limited to  the confidential patient  identification code list, 
original consent and assent forms, and source records , will be maintained by the 
Investigator in strict confidence.

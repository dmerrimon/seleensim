INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT:  
Natroba™ (spinosad) Topical Suspension, 0.9%  U.S. IND No.

PHASE:  
3 
INDICATION:  
Treatment of scabies  
OBJECTIVES:  
The primary objective is to assess  the safety and efficacy of topical Natroba™ (spinosad) versus 
Placebo for the complete  cure of scabies after  a single treatment.  
The s econdary objective will assess pharmacokinetics (PK) of spinosad and benzyl alcohol following a 
single dose of Natroba™ in pediatric subjects 4 -16 years of age .  These subjects will be a separate 
population of pediatric subjects . 
ENDPOINTS:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of “index” subjects completely  cured of scabies by Day 
28. The “index” subject is defined as the youngest infested household member (≥4 years). Complete 
cure is defined as demonstration of both clinical cure (all signs and symptoms have completely 
resolved, including burrows, inflammatory /non-inflammatory lesions and prurit us) and microscopic or 
dermatoscopic  cure demonstratin g the absence of mites, eggs, and/or scybala, and negative  
dermatoscopy  for burrows.  
The s econdary endpoint  include s assessing  the PK parameters (C max, Tmax and AUC 0-12h) of spinosad 
(Spinosy n A and Spinosyn D) and benzyl alcohol pre-dose and during 12 hours post -dose of Natroba™  
in pediatric  subjects (ages 4 -16 years) .  
Safety endpoint s include  the evaluation of adverse events , general skin and eye irritation,  clinical 
laboratory assessments , vital signs, and use of prior and concomitant medications . 
POPULATION:  
Approximately 384 subjects  will be enrolled in the study. The approximate 384 total is based on:  
120 households, each with an “index ” subject  and approximately 2 additional subjects per household 
(infested or not) for 360 total, and 24 additional pediatric subjects with confirmed scabies infestation 
from “non -index” households  for PK analysis . The 120 “index ” subjects with confirmed scabies 
infestati on will comprise the primary efficacy population in order to achieve , with attrition, 48 subjects 
completed  per trea tment group (Natroba™ versus P lacebo) . In this study, “index” subjects will be 
defined as the youngest infested household member (≥4 years).  All household members  of the “ index ” 
subject  will be  randomized to the same treatment.  The pediatric subjects  who comprise the PK 
population will be 12 male or female subjects 4 – 9 years of age (with a minimum of 6 male or female 
subjects 4 – 6 years of age) and 12 male or female subjects 10 – 16 years of age.  I

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION:  
The primary study is a double blind, two -arm, 28 -day, placebo -controlled study with approximately 
120 infested “index” subjects randomized 1:1 to Natroba™ or Placebo. All members of a household 
(no more than 6 individuals) with a suspected “index”  subject must be screened at the first visit. In this 
study, “index” subjects are defined as the youngest infested household member (≥4 years). If the 
members have an active sc abies infestation and meet all other criteria,  they must agree to participate in 
the study. Household members who do not present with scabies at the screening visit must also agree to 
apply the same blinded investigational product  (IP) as household members  who present with scabies 
(see Table 6-1 Schedule of Procedures for status assessment). All household members must agree to 
participate in the study or none will be enrolled. Screening procedures include informed consent, 
medication and medical history, urine pregnancy test for females of childbe aring potential, scabies 
assessment  (visual evidence of burrows , inflammatory/non -inflammatory lesions and pruritus),  
microscopic exam ination of skin scraping,  or dermatoscopy , to demonstrate the presence of mites, 
eggs, and/or scybala (dermatoscopy must c onfirm burrows), vital signs, general skin and eye 
assessment, randomization, CBC and serum chemistry, and IP dispensing and instruction.  
After screening on Day 1, all randomized subjects  in the primary population  will be dispensed IP  
(Natroba™  or Placebo)  to apply  at home  later the same day  as a single treatment over the entire body 
from the neck down to the toes (including  the soles of the feet ) and to the scalp (if balding) or hairline, 
temples and forehead on the same day. Subjects less than 12 years of  age should be assisted with 
administration by a parent, guardian or caregiver. Subjects will rub the treatment into the skin followed 
by a 10 -minute wait period before getting dressed. Showering or bathing must not occur earlier than 6 
hours after treatme nt and no later than at lea st 1 hour prior to Day 2 visit.  
A separate population  of 24 pediatric “non -index” subjects  that do not reside in the “index” subject’s 
household will be enrolled  to assess the PK o f spinosad and benzyl alcohol for 12 hours after open -
label topical application on a single in -clinic visit ( Day 1 , or Day 2 if screening only on Day 1 ). There 
will be 12 male or female subjects 4 – 9 years of age (with a minimum of 6 male or female subjects 4 – 
6 years of age) and 12 male or female subj ects 10 – 16 years of age.  With assistance from a caregiver, 
Natroba™  will be applied over entire body from the neck down  to the toes  (including the soles of the 
feet) and to the hairline, temples, and forehead . The open -label product will remain on the sk in for at 
least 6 hours before bathing or showering. The subjects will stay in the clinic until the 12 -hour 
procedures are completed. Blood draws will be taken at 0 hours just prior to treatment, and then at 0.5, 
1.0, 3.0, 6.0  hours post-treatment  and then at 12 hours  post-treatment . Bathing must occur after the 6 
hour blood draw but prior to the 12 hour blood draw.  A ±5 minute time window will be allowed for all 
post-treatment blood samples. Safety will be assessed  with adverse events (AEs), general skin and eye 
irritation assessments , pre-dose and pre -discharge laboratory evaluations, and vital signs during the 12 
hours in -clinic. Following the sample collections subjects will be released from the clinic  and directed 
to their primary care physician for fo llow-up. PK subjects will be provided 5% Permethrin upon 
discharge to dispense to household members.   
In the primary population  (all household members) , on Day 2  (Visit 2) , general skin and eye 
assessments will be made for possible irritation, and to confirm that all IP was left on for a minimum of 
6 hours before bathing or showering.  If a subject reports an  adverse event assessed as related by the PI 
on Day 2 (Visit 2) then a follow -up visit with the investigator must be scheduled within 7 days of vis it.  
Subjects will receive a well -being phone call o n Day 14  to continue to emphasize inst ructions to 
prevent re -infestation, determine if any concomitant medications have been used , and check for adverse 
events.   If a subject reports an adverse event assessed as related by the PI on the Day 14 well -being 
phone call, then a follow -up visit with the investigator must be scheduled within 7 days of phone call.

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  On Day 28  (Visit 3) , all household members  will return to the clinic for safety and efficacy 
assessments . The  primary endpoint of complete  cure will be assessed in the infested household 
members . If the infested subject is c ompletely  cured at Day 28, he or she will have completed the study 
and termination procedures will be conducted.  If the subje ct is not c ompletely  cured at Day 28 (with 
Natroba™ or P lacebo), the subject will receive 5% Permethrin  and will be directed to their primary 
care physician for follow -up. 
Safety assessments will be made for all household members and will include monitorin g of adverse 
events (A Es) throughout the study, vital signs recording (Days 1 and 28), clinical laboratory analyses 
(Days 1 and 28), and general skin and eye irritation assessments (Days 1, 2, and 28).  
The Day 28 procedures will also be completed for early  termination (ET) except subjects will not 
receive rescue Permethrin , but will be directed to follow -up with their primary care physician.  
The trial design is presented in the Study Flow Diagram ( Figure 3-1) and the visit assessments are 
described in the Schedule of Procedures ( Table 6-1).

DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
Natroba™ or P lacebo applied in a single topical application to the entire body from the neck down to 
the toes (including the  soles of the feet ) and to the scalp (if balding) and/or hairline, temples, and 
forehead.  
EFFICACY VARIABLES:  
The primary e fficacy assessment  is the  proportion of index subjects completely cured of scabies by 
Day 28.  Complete cure is defined as demonstration of clinical cure (all signs and symptoms have 
completely resolved, including burrows, inflammatory/non -inflammatory lesions and pruritu s) and 
microscopic or dermatoscopic  cure demonstratin g the absence of mites, eggs, and/or scybala, and 
negative  dermatoscopy  for burrows.  
 The s econdary efficacy assessment  include s assessing the PK parameters (C max, Tmax and AUC 0-12h) of 
spinosad (Spinosyn A and Spinosyn D) and benzyl alcohol pre -dose and during 12 hours post -dose of 
Natroba™ in pediatric subjects (ages 4 -16 years).  
 
PHA RMACOKINETIC VARIABLES:  
A blood draw will be taken from subjects in the PK population just before spinosad  application (t=0) 
and then at 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 6.0 and 12 hours . The following PK parameters  will be calculated for spinosad  
(Spinosyn A and Spinosyn D ) and benzyl alcohol  in each subject : Cmax, Tmax, and AUC 0-12h. 
SAFETY ASSESSMENTS:  
In the primary population, s afety assessments include monitoring of A Es on study  Days 1, 2, 14 (phone 
call) and 28 , general skin and eye irritation assessments  on Days 1, 2 and 28, vital signs  on Days 1 and 
28, laboratory assessments  on Days 1 and 28, prior medications on Day 1 and concomitant medications  
on Days 2 and Day 28. For early termination (ET), t he Day 28 procedures will also be completed . In 
the PK popula tion, the same safety assessment s will be made for the single in -clinic visit on Day 1. 
Smaller laboratory blood samples will be collected pre -dose and 12 -hours post -dose prior to discharge.   
STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of index subjects completely  cured of scabies by Day 
28. The primary analysis set will be the “index” intent -to-treat ( I-ITT) population  which is defined as 
all randomized index subjects regardless of whether  they have had any post -baseline assessments and 
the primary efficacy endpoint will be  the proportion of index subjects completely  cured  of scabies by 
Day 28 . The number and percentage of index subjects who exhibit complete cure (Yes or No) by Day 
28 will be presented by treatment group.  A Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel general association test stratified

Page 9 of 66 
ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  by study site (possibly pooled) will be used to compare the complete cure rates between the two 
treatment groups.   The primary analysis will be performed at a si gnificance level of 0.05.  
In the PK population, t he parameters Cmax, Tmax and AUC 0-12h will be used to assess  the absorption  over 
12 hours post -administration in 24 subjects (4 -16 years) . The PK  parameter estimates will be computed 
with noncompartmental methods for each subject. Individual elapsed sampling times (actual time) will 
be used in the PK analysis  and parameters will be computed for each subject.  Descriptive summaries of 
the plasma conc entration levels for both spinosad  (Spinosyn A and Spinosyn D)  and benzyl alcohol 
observed at each nominal time point will be provided. Descriptive summaries of the PK parameter 
estimates will also be completed. Summary statistics for continuous variables will include number of 
non-missing observations , mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (CV%), median, 
minimum, and maximum, geometric mean and standard error of the geometric mean.  
The safety endpoint s include  the evaluation of adverse events , general skin and eye irritation 
assessments , clinical laboratory assessments , vital signs, and use of prior and concomitant medications.  
Additionally, the  descriptive  changes from baseline  (pre-dose)  to final assessment (Day 28 in primary 
population and pre -discharge in PK population) will be calculated for applicable  parameter s. 
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION : 
For the primary efficacy analysis, approximately 120 “index” subjects will be enrolled (including 
possible 20% attrition) from 120 households and randomized 1:1 to each of Natroba™ (spinosad) and 
Placebo control. The index subject will be the youngest infested member of a household (≥4 years). 
Referencing to the Sponsor’s Proof of Concept (POC) study (S PN-401-12) and published literature,5-10 
out of 60 completed subjects, the cure rate is 70% for Natroba™ and 30% for Placebo control.  Based 
upon a reasonable assumption of 60% cure rate for Natroba™ and 30% for placebo, a sample size of 48 
study -completed “index” subjects per group will provi de 80% power to declare the non -equivalency 
using a delta of 30% and Type I error rat e of 0.05.   Fisher exact test was used to calculate the sample 
size and the specified power in the following Table 8 -1 (PASS 14; 2015, NCSS, LLC., Kaysville, Utah, 
USA. www.ncss.com ). 
 
For the pediatric PK analysis , a sample size of an additional 24 subjects will be enrolled and is based 
on the previous PK studies performed on children 6 months to 4 years of age with head lice infestations 
in which Natroba™ was administered as a single open -label topical treatment and PK sampling 
performed over a 12 -hour period.3 In the current study, 24 male and female subjects (4 -16 years of age) 
with scabies infestation will be enrolled: 12 male or female subjects 4 – 9 years of age (with a 
minimum of 6 male or female subjects 4 – 6 years of age) and 12 male  or female subjects 10 – 16 years 
of age.  No formal power calculations were performed for the PK sample size . 
SITES:  
This study will be conducted at approximately 5-10 sites in the United States.

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  3. Primary Endpoint – Complete cure is defined as demonstration of clinical cure (all signs and symptoms 
have completely resolved, including inflammatory /non-inflammatory lesions and  pruritus) and microscopic 
or dermatoscop ic cure with demonstration of the absence of mites, eggs, and/or scybala, and dermatoscopy 
negative for burrows.   
4. Vital signs – height (only Visit 1), weight, blood pressure, and heart rate.  
5. Assessment at Visit 1 for eligibility (skin) and eye for baseline  and Visit 2 skin and eye irritation and to 
confirm IP was washed off, and Visit 3/ET (if applicable) for skin and eye irritation. See Section 7.7 for 
rating eye irritation.  
6. Differential not required unless CBC abnormal.  Blood draws for clinical chemistry and hematology in the 
PK population will be pre -dose and pre -discharge.  
7. Pharmacoki netics  will be assessed in a pediatric population of 24 subjects aged 4 -16 years, s ubjects will 
have blood samples drawn at 0 hours just prior to treatment, and then at 0.5, 1 .0, 3.0, 6.0 and 12 hours. A 
±5 minute time window will be allowed for all post -treatment blood samples.  Showering should occur 
between the 6 -hour and 12 -hour blood draws.  Only Day 1 and Day 2 procedures will be completed by PK 
subjects, during their single clinic visit participation.   
8. IP Treatment – instruct to administer single top ical application of IP over entire body from the neck down  
to the toes (including soles of the feet) and on the scalp/hairline, temples and forehead,  by the subject at 
household. Subjects will not shower for at least 6 hours after application and no later than at least 1 hour 
before Day 2 visit. Subjects less than 12 years of age should be assisted with administration by a  parent, 
guardian or caregiver.  
9. Confirm that all IP was left on for a minimum of 6 hours before bathing or showering and washed off at 
least 1 hour before Day 2 visit.  Instruct/re -instruct subjects how to prevent re -infestation, to stay in one 
household, as well as to follow all stu dy procedures and expectations.  
10. Collect and weigh used bottle if not collected at Visit 2 . 
11. Assessed starting p ost-consent . Investigators will follow unrelated AEs until the final study visit (Day  28). 
All SAEs, and all AEs deemed by the Investigator to be related to IP or treatment, will be followed until the 
event has resolved.  
12. Subjects in the PK population will be assessed for safety or irritation captured as adverse events following 
administration of Natroba™ until discharge from the clinic, at which time they will be directed to their 
primary care physician for follow -up. 
13. PK subjects will be provided 5% Permeth rin upon discharge to dispense to household members.  Subjects 
who are not completely cured  at this visit (Day 28) will be provided with 5% Permethrin  as rescue 
medication. Subjects who terminated early will not receive rescue medication . All subjects  will be directed 
to their primary care physician for follow -up. 
14. If a subject reports an adverse event assessed as related by the PI on Day 2 (Visit 2) then a follow -up visit 
with the investigator must be scheduled within 7 days of visit.  If a subject reports an adverse event 
assessed as related by the PI on the Day 14 well -being phone call, then a follow -up visit with the 
investigator must be scheduled within 7 days of phone call .    
15. It is intended for the AE follow -up to occur within 7 days of the day 14 call.  The Day 14 call may occur 
between study day 12 and 16.  
 
**If PK subject only has screen procedures on Day 1,  then IP administration, PK blood draws and other procedures 
scheduled for Visit 1 will be conducted on Day 2

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  1 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
1.1 Background  
Human scabies is caused by an infestation of the skin by the human itch mite (Sarcoptes scabiei 
var. hominis). The microscopic scabies mite burrows into the upper layer of the skin where it 
lives and lays its eggs. The most common symptoms of scabies are intense itching an d a pimple -
like skin rash. The itching and rash each may affect much of the body or be limited to common 
sites such as the wrist, elbow, armpit, webbing between the fingers, nipple, penis, waist, belt -
line, and buttocks. The rash also can include tiny blis ters (vesicles) and scales. Scratching the 
rash can cause skin sores; sometimes these sores become infected by bacteria. Tiny burrows 
sometim es are seen on the skin  which  are caused by the female scabies mite tunneling just 
beneath the surface of the skin.  These burrows appear as tiny raised and crooked (serpiginous) 
grayish -white or skin - colored lines on the skin surface. Mites are often few in number s (only 10 -
15 mites per person)  and the burrows may be difficult to find. The  burrows  are found most often  
in the webbing between the fingers, in the skin folds on the wrist, elbow, or knee, and on the 
penis, breast, or shoulder blades. The head, face, neck, palms, and soles often are involved in 
infants and very young children, but usually not adults and olde r children.1,2 
The scabies mite is usual ly spread by direct, prolonged, skin -to-skin contact with a  person who 
has scabies. Scabies occurs worldwide and affects people of all races and social classes. 
Worldwide prevalence has been estimated at about 300 million cases yearly.2 Scabies can spread 
rapidly under crowded conditions where close body contact is frequent. Institutions such as 
nursing homes, extended -care facilities, and prisons are often sites of scabies outbreaks.  Current 
treatment recommended by Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is a single overnight topical 
application of 5% Permethrin .1 
Natroba™  (spinosad) Topical Suspension, 0.9% has been approved by the Foo d and Drug 
Administration for the treatment of head lice in patients 6 months of age and older .3 Spinosad is 
derived from the fermentation of a soil  actinimycete bacterium, and acts by causing neuronal 
excitation in insects. After periods of hyperexcitation, the lice become paralyzed and die. This 
same mode of action applies to the scabies mite. After topical application in infested pediatric 
subjects , spinosad levels in plasma were below the limits of quantitation. Preclinical testing for 
carcinogenesis, mutagenesis and impairment of fertility were negative. Clinical studies with 
subjects infested with head lice showed  Natroba™  (spinosad) Topical Susp ension, 0.9% to be 
more effective than Permethrin  14 days after treatment .3

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  1.2 Rationale  
ParaPRO conducted a proof -of-concept trial that was a double -blinded, two -arm 28 -day placebo 
controlled study of subjects randomly assigned 3:1 to NatrobaTM or Placebo .4 Subjects applied a 
single treat ment over the entire body from the neck down to the toes (including the  soles of the 
feet) in-clinic on Day 1, rubbing the investigational product ( IP) into the skin  and waiting 10 
minutes before getting dressed. Showering or bathing was to occur no earlie r than  6 hours after 
treatment. Efficacy assessments included visual skin assessment of scabies  infestation (visual 
assessment of burrows, lesion counts, and presence of new lesions), skin  scraping for 
microscopic examination (for evidence of mites) and a pruritus score by a  subjective scale. The 
scabies scores were changed by -1.4 with Natroba (p=0.0020), compared to -1.0 with Placebo  
(p=0.2500). The count of lesions was significantly decreased with Natroba ( -28.1, p=0.0020), 
however, not with Placebo  (-9.8, p=0.6250). Microscopy showed significant improvement, 13/15 
negative with Natroba (p=0.0074), compared to 3/5 with Placebo  (p=1.000).  
The design for th e current Phase 3  trial is similar to the phase 3 trials evaluating efficacy of 
Natroba™ Topical Suspe nsion for treatment of head lice , although subjects in this trial received 
only one application of the Natroba™ Topical Suspension .3 In the two phas e 3 studies of 
individuals with lice, all subjects who were treated on Day 0 returned for efficacy evaluation at 
Day 7. Subjects with live lice present at Day 7 received a second treatment. Subjects who were 
lice free on Day 7 were to return on Day 14 for evaluation. Subjects  with live lice and who 
received a second treatment on Day 7 were to return on Days 14 and 21 for evaluation. Efficacy 
was assessed as the proportion of primary subjects who were free of live lice 14 days after the 
initial/final treatment.  
Based on the safety and efficacy of Natroba™  (spinosad) Topical Suspension, 0.9% in the 
treatment of head lice,3 the present study is de signed to evaluate  pivotal phase 3 data on the 
safety and efficacy of the topical suspension against scabies, an infestation by Sarcoptes scabiei 
var. hominis . The effect of the Natroba™  (spinosad) Topical Suspension, 0.9% will be  compared 
to that of a Placebo  control.  In addition, pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of Natroba ™ over the first 12 
hours post -administra tion will be assessed in a pediatric population of 24 subjects aged 4 -16 
years.

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  All members of a household (no more than 6 individuals) with a suspected “index” subject must 
be screened at the first visit. In this study, “index” subjects are defined as the youngest infested 
household member (≥4 years). If the household has  at least on e member with  active scabies 
infestation and meet all other criteria, they must all agree to participate in the study. Household 
members who do not present with scabies at the screening visit  must also agree to apply the same 
blinded investigational produc t (IP) as household members who present with scabies (see Table 
6-1 Schedule of Procedures for status assessment). All household members must agree to 
participate in the study or none will be enrolled. Screening procedures include informed consent, 
medication and medical history, urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential, 
scabies assessment  (visual evidence of burrows, inflammatory/non -inflammatory les ions and 
pruritus) , microscopic exam ination of skin scraping  or derm atoscopy to demonstrate the presence 
of mites, eggs, and/or scybala  (dermatoscopy must confirm burrows ), vital  signs, general skin 
and eye assessment, randomization, CBC and serum chemistr y, and IP dispensing and 
instruction.  
After screening on Day 1, all randomized subjects in the primary population will be dispensed IP 
(Natroba™ or Placebo) to apply at home later the same day as a single treatment over the entire 
body from the neck down t o the toes (including the soles of the feet ) and to the scalp (if balding)  
or hairline, temples and forehead on the same day. Subjects less than 12 years of age should be 
assisted with administration by a parent, guardian or caregiver. Subjects will rub th e treatment 
into the skin followed by a 10 -minute wait period before getting dressed. Showering or bathing 
must not occur earlier than 6 hours after treatment and no later than at least 1 hour prior to Day 2 
visit.  
A separate population of 24 pediatric “no n-index” subjects that do not reside in the “index” 
subject’s household will be enrolled to assess the PK of spinosad and benzyl alcohol for 12 hours 
after open -label topical application on a single in -clinic visit (Day 1 , or Day 2 if screening only 
on Day  1). There will be 12 male or female subjects 4 – 9 years of age (with a minimum of 6 
male or female subjects 4 – 6 years of age) and 12 male or female subjects 10 – 16 years of age. 
With assistance from a caregiver, Natroba™ will be applied over entire bo dy from the neck 
down and to the toes (including the soles of the feet ) and to the hairline, temples and forehead.  
The open -label product will remain on the skin for at least 6 hours before bathing or showering.   
The subjects will stay in the clinic until the 12 -hour procedures are completed. Blood draws will 
be taken at 0 hour (just prior to treatment ), and then at 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 6.0 hours post-treatment  and 
then at 12 hours  post-treatment .   Bathing must occur after the 6 hour blood draw but prior to the 
12 hour blood draw.  A ±5 minute time window will be allowed for all post -treatment blood 
samples. Safety will be assessed  using  adverse events (AEs), general skin and eye irritation 
assessmen ts, pre-dose and pre -discharge  laboratory evaluations, and vital signs during the 12

directed to their primary care physician for follow -up. PK subjects will be  provided 5% 
Permethrin upon discharge to dispense to household members.   
In the primary population (all household members), on Day 2 (Visit 2), general skin and eye 
assessments will be made for possible irritation, and to confirm that all IP was left on for a 
minimum of 6 hours before bathing or showering. If a subject reports an adverse event assessed 
as related by the PI on Day 2 (Visit 2) then a follow -up visit with the investigator must be 
scheduled within 7 days of visit.  Subjects will receive a wel l-being phone call on Day 14 to 
continue to emphasize instructions to prevent re -infestation, determine if any concomitant 
medications have been used, and check for adverse events.  If a subject reports an adverse event 
assessed as related by the PI on the  Day 14 well -being phone call, then a follow -up visit with the 
investigator must be scheduled within 7 days of phone call. On Day 28 (Visit 3), primary 
population subjects  will return to the clinic for safety and efficacy assessments. The primary 
endpoint of complete cure will be assessed in the infested household members. If the infested 
subject is completely cured at Day 28, he or she will have completed the study and termination 
procedures will be conducted. If the subject is not completely cured at Day 28 (with Natroba™ 
or Placebo), the subject will receive 5% Permethrin and will be directed to their primary care 
physician for follow -up. 
Safety assessments will be made for all household members and will include monitoring of 
adverse events (AEs) througho ut the study, vital signs recording (Days 1 and 28), clinical 
laboratory analyses (Days 1 and 28), and general skin and eye irritation assessments (Days 1, 2, 
and 28).  
The Day 28 procedures will also be completed for early termination (ET) except subjects will not 
receive rescue Permethrin but will be directed to follow -up with their primary care physician.  
The trial design is presented in the Study Flow Diagram (Figure 3-1) and the visit assessments 
are described in the Schedule of Procedures  (Table 6-1). 
3.2 Discussion of Study Design  
The phase 3 study design is a generally accepted clinical approach  to provide sufficient pivotal 
results for the evaluation of safety and efficacy.  The design for this trial is similar to the phase 3 
trials evaluating efficacy of Natroba™  Topical Suspension for treatment of head lice  except that 
in this study the subjects will receive only one application of Natroba™  Topical Suspension .3 In 
the two phase 3 studies of individuals with lice, all subj ects who were treated on Day 0 returned 
for efficacy evaluation at Day 7. Subjects with live lice present at Day 7 received a second 
treatment. Subjects who were lice free on Day 7 were to return on Day 14 for evaluation.

Page 25 of 66 
ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  Subjects with live lice and who re ceived a second  treatment on Day 7 were to return on Days 14 
and 21 for evaluation. Efficacy was  assessed as the proportion of primary subjects who were free 
of live lice 14 days after the initial  and/or final treatment.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of index subjects c omplete ly cured of 
scabies by Day 28  after a single application of IP on Day 1 . In household s where efficacy results 
are likely to be correlated , selecting one subject  (index subject)  from each  unit provides for 
efficacy results that are more independent . These subjects are  selected according to a consistent 
criterion ; in this study “index” subjects will be defined as the youngest (≥4 years) infested 
member of the household. Thus the primary analysis  population  will be the “index” intent -to-
treat ( I-ITT) population  which is defined as all randomized index subjects regardless of whether  
they have had any post -baseline assessments and the primary efficacy endpoint will be  the 
proportion of index subject s complete ly cured of scabies by Day 28 . 
A large open -label, randomized, comparative, parallel clinical trial conducted in 315 patients 
with uncomplicated scabies assessed the efficacy and safety of topical Permethrin , oral 
ivermectin, and topical ivermect in.5 The first group received Permethrin  5% cream as single 
application, second group received tablet ivermectin 200 mcg/kg as single dose, and third group 
received ivermectin 1% lotion as single application. All the patients received anti -histaminic for 
pruritus. The patients were followed up a t intervals of 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks. Primary efficacy 
variable was clinical cure of lesions. Statistical analysis was done by chi square test and one -way 
ANOVA test. At the end of first week, cure rate was 74.8% in Permethrin  group, 30% in oral 
ivermectin group, and 69.3% in topical ivermectin group (P < 0.05). At the end of second week, 
cure rate was 99% in Permethrin  group, 63% in oral ivermectin group, and 100% in topical 
ivermectin group (P < 0.05). At the end of third week, 100% cure rate was observed in 
Permethrin  and topical ivermectin group while 99% in oral ivermectin group (P = 0.367). While 
oral ivermectin was found to be significantly less effective than the 2 topical treatments, there 
was no difference in effectiveness of topical Permethrin  and topical ivermectin , each achieving a 
faster cure rate than oral ivermectin  with one treatment.  
Based on the safety and efficacy of Natroba™  (spinosad) Topical Suspension  (0.9% ) in the 
treatment of head lice,3 and published trials of other scabicides,6,7,8 the present study is  designed 
to evaluate pivo tal phase 3 data on the safety and efficacy of a single topical application of 
NatrobaTM.  The effect iveness  of Natroba™  (spinosad) will be compa red to that of a Placebo  
control  at 28 days . If complete cure  is not attained at 28 days , 5% Permethrin  will be 
administered to those subjects and the subjects will be directed to their primary care physician 
for follow up .

5.3 Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
As “index” subjects and other infested  or non -infes ted household members become eligible for 
randomization at Visit 1 (Day 1), the site will locally assign a unique subject number to each of 
the qualified household members that combines a 3 -digit site number (xxx), a 2 -digit household 
number (yy), and a 2 -digit household member number (zz). For example, the first subject of the 
first household at site 101 would be randomized to subject number 101 -01-01, the second 
member to 101 -01-02, the third member to 101 -01-03, and so on. Since all household members 
receive the same treatment, each household is randomized to either Natroba™ (spinosad) or 
Placebo  control.  Non-infested household members will be assigned the same IP treatment as the 
infested members and will be assigned a subject number and randomization nu mber. The 
assigned subject numbers to each household will correspond to unique bottle numbers on a 
scheme that unblinded site personnel will assign and distribute to ensure approximately equal 
randomization of households to either treatment. Subject number s must not be re -used once 
assigned, even if the subject does not take the IP. 
For the pediatric PK population , assignment of a unique subject number will occur as the subject 
becomes eligible for enrollment. Randomization numbers will not be assigned as I P is open -
label.  
5.4 Administration of Investigational Product  
For both treatment groups, the blinded Natroba™  (spinosad ) or Placebo  control will be 
administered by the subject on Day 1 at the subject ’s home . All “index” and other infested and 
non-infested household members will be assigned the same IP treatment, either blinded 
Natroba™  (spinosad) or Placebo  control . The index subject s and all household members  will be

the feet) and to the scalp (if balding) or hairline, temples, and forehead.  Subjects should not 
shower for at least 6 hours after application.  Subjects less than 12 years of age  should be assisted 
with administration by a parent, guardian or caregiver.  
A separate population of 24 “non -index” pediatric subjects with confirmed scabies infestation 
who do not reside in the “index” subject’s household will be recruited for a PK analys is over 12 
hours after topical open -label Natroba™ application. There will be 12 male or female subjects 4 
– 9 years of age (with a minimum of 6 male or female subjects 4 – 6 years of age) and 12 male or 
female subjects 10 – 16 years of age. Subjects will be admitted into a clinical environment on the 
day of product application (Day 1). The open -label product will be applied over the entire body 
from the neck down and to the hairline , temples, and forehead and the product will remain on the 
skin for at leas t 6 hours before bathing or showering. Subjects will be instructed to bath or 
shower between the 6 -hour and 12 -hour post IP application blood draws.  The subjects will stay 
in the clinic until the 12 -hour procedures are completed. Blood draws will be taken  at 0 hours 
just prior to treatment, and then at 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 6.0 and 12 hours. Following the sample 
collections subjects will be provided with 5% Permethrin for all household members, and 
released from the clinic.    
If complete  cure is not achieved by Day 28 visit, 5% Permethrin  will be  dispensed to all uncured 
subjects  and they will be directed to their primary care physician for follow up . All uncured 
subjects  will be instructed to apply the  5% Permethrin  as per manufacturer’s instructions . 
Subjects who early terminate (ET) will not receive 5% Permethrin and will be directed to their 
primary care physician for follow  up. 
5.5 Treatment Accountability and Compliance  
At Visit 1 , each subject’s bottle of IP will be weighed and recorded (application instructio ns 
provided) as well as the height and weight of the subject before each subject takes the IP home. 
All household members will be provided with the same blinded study treatment . The IP  will be  
applied at the subject’s home.  
Each subject’s bottle will be  returned the next day at Visit 2.  An accounting of the amount of IP 
used by the subject (by weight) will be documented by the clinic staff. At Visit 2, subjects will 
be asked to confirm that IP was applied from neck down  and to the scalp (if balding)  or hairline, 
temples, and forehead  and was hed/rinsed off no earlier than 6 hours after application , and no 
later than at least 1 hour before Visit 2. The used IP bottle will be collected at Visit 3 if not

5.6 Blinding and Unblinding Method  
Eligible households  will be assigned to eith er Natroba™  (spinosad) or Placebo  control, by 
pre-specif ied un -blinded site personnel. The un -blinded site personnel will assign all eligible 
members from the same househol d to the same treatment group. While t he treatment bottles for 
each household will have unique numbers , the numbers for that household will correspond to a 
specific treatment , Natroba™  (spinosad) or Placebo  control. Un-blinded site staff will maintain 
the randomization sche me with treatment code  and associated bottle numbers , and will no t reveal 
the information to the subjects, blinded study personnel or ParaPRO LLC until after the database 
lock.  
In an emergency, the study blind may be broken only if:  
• in the opinion of the investigator and/or the Medical Monitor, it is in the subject's best 
interest to do so ; 
• knowledge of the treatment will alter the clinical management of the subject ; 
• approval has been granted by the Medical Monitor and/or ParaPRO LLC . 
Whenever possible, the Medical Monitor should be notified prior to unblinding a treat ment 
assignment. In the event that unblinding is necessary for the medical management of the subject, 
the pre-specified un -blinded site personnel  will access the randomization code by a treatment 
code list provided by Concentrics Research  to each site . If a treatment assignment is unblinded, 
the date and reason for the unblinding must be recorded on the subject’s source document, and 
the Medical Monitor notified within 24  hours.  The emergency contact telephone number for the 
Medical Monitor , Dr. William Mil ler, is (800) 210-5734 . If Dr. Miller ’s phone is not answered at 
the time of your call , PLEASE leave a message so Dr. Miller can return your call immediately.

6.7 Early Termination Procedures  
The term "Early  Termination"  refers  to a subject’s  non-completion  of a study  whether  by his  or 
her own choice  or the investigator’ s decisio n or due to discontinuatio n of the study  by ParaPR O 
LLC.  In the absence  of a medical contraindicatio n or significan t protocol violation,  every  effort  
will be made by the Investigator to keep  the subject in the study.  Should  the subject  decide  to 
withdraw,  an early  termination  visit should be conducted , which will include  all procedures  
normally done  at Visit 3. 
The primary reason  for a subject  withdrawing  prematurely  should  be selected  from  the 
following  categories: 
Adverse  Event  or Serio us Adverse  Event —events that are associated  with discontinuation.  
Noncompliance  with protocol —the subject  failed  to adhere  to the protocol  require ments.  The 
deviation  necessitated  premature termination  from  the study.  
Withdrawal  of Consent —subjec t desire s to withdra w from further  participation in the study  in 
the absence  of an adverse  event or a medical  need  to withdraw.  
Lost to Follow -up—the subject  did not return  for one or more follow -up visit(s)  followin g 
dispensin g of test drug. The reaso n was unknown  and appropriate due diligence was exerted 
by the investigator to contact the subject and encourage their return . 
Other —causes  of premature  termination  from  the study  other  than the above,  such as theft  or 
loss of IP, termination  of study  by ParaPRO  LLC,  etc. The details of the premature 
termination in this “other” category should be documented fully

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  7 DETAILED DESCRIPTION  OF ASSESSMENTS  
7.1 Informed Consent  and Assent  
Written informed consent will be obtained from subjects who are 12 years of age and older as 
well as the parent or legal gu ardian of subjects who are 4 -17 years of age before any study 
procedures are performed. In addition to the parent or legal guardian signing the informed 
consent, verbal and written assent will be obtained from subjects who are between the ages of 7 -
11 year s of age. Assent is not required for subjects 4 -6 years of age; however, the parent or legal 
guardian must sign consent . All potential subjects for the study (or their legal guardians) will be 
given a copy of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved i nformed consent form to read. 
The IRB is Schulman IRB (Cincinnati, OH 45242).  
The assent and/or consent forms will be discussed in detail with each potentially eligible subject 
and the parent or legal guardian of subjects 4 -17 years of age, if applicable. The PI or qualified 
designee will explain all aspects of the study in lay language and answer all the subject's 
questions regarding the study. The PI or designee will inform the subject as to the nature, aims, 
duration, potential hazards, and procedures to  be performed during the study and that his or her 
medical records may be reviewed. The PI or designee will also explain that the subject is 
completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time. Subjects who 
refuse to participate  or who withdraw from the study will be treated without prejudice.  
No study procedures will be performed nor IPs released to any subject who has not signed the 
assent or IC form or whose parent or legal guardian has not signed the IC form.  
7.2 Medical History  
A complete medical history  will be obtained at Screening (Visit 1).  
7.3 Prior Medications and Concomitant Medications  
Investigator’s need to be aware that patients often have severe prurit us and will be prescribed 
medication s as well as take OTC med ications to  treat this condition . The PI needs to  inform 
the subject of  prohibit ed topical medications used for itching or other indication , including 
over-the-counter (OTC) cortisone products , as these may interfere with efficacy evaluations . 
Non-medicated lotions a re allowed  after IP is washed off  (e.g., non -scented, hypoallergenic, 
etc.). Subjects  will be instructed  not to take any oral prescription  medications  without  prior  
consultation  with the Investigator unless their primary physician  otherwise instru cts. Oral 
Benadryl ® (diphenhydramine) and other oral OTC anti-pruritics are allowed  for itch relief . 
Subjects  will be instructed  to tell their primary physi cian of their participation  in this study  if 
they consult  their physicia n durin g the study . Any therapy  taken  by the subject  in the 4 week s 
before  rando mization  (Visit  1) will be reported  as prior  medication.  Any therapy  started  or

All prior  and conco mitant medications inclu ding topic al treatments (prescription  and over the 
counter,  vitamins, and mineral  supplements, and/or  herbs) will be documented  and must  inclu de 
the following  information:  
• Medication  name 
• Indication  
• Start  date 
• Stop date or “Ongoing”  
7.4 Prohibited Medications  
Subjects should not use any scabicide within 4 weeks before Visit 1, or use any scabicide, or 
rescue Permethrin , prescription or OTC medicated lotions, other than the IP during the study, 
through Day  28. There will be no washout of prohibited medications, subjects will be excluded 
or withdrawn from the study for use of prohibited medications.  
7.5 Pregnancy and Contraceptive Use  
Urine  pregnancy  tests will be cond ucted on women of childbearing  potential  at screening  (Visit  
1) and end of study  (Visit  3/ET). Such  subjects  should  be willing  and able to practice  an 
accepta ble method of contraception  during  the study.  Examples of acceptable  contraceptive  
methods  include  abstinence,  intrauterin e device (IUD),  double  barrier  method,  or oral or 
injectable  contrace ptives  (must have  been  using  syste mic contraceptives  for at least 3 months).  
If abstinence is their primary method of birth control they should be instructed to use a double 
barrier method if they become  sexually active  with another household member . 
7.6 Scabie s Assessment  
Skin will be examined at Visits 1  and 3/ET to establish positive or negative evidence of active 
scabies infestation.  
• Scabies diagnosis – active scabies infestation confirmed by clinical signs and symptoms 
(evidence of burrows or presence of scabies inflammatory/non -inflammatory lesions and 
pruritus) as well as by microscopic exam ination of skin scraping  or dermatoscopy to 
demonstrate the presence of mites, eggs, and/or scybala. If dermato scopy is used it should 
also confirm there are burrows on the skin.  
• Primary Efficacy Endpoint – complete cure is defined as demonstration of clinical cure 
(all signs and symptoms have completely resolved, including burrows,

cure with demonstration of the absence of mites, eggs, and/or scybala, and dermatoscopy 
negative for burrows.  
7.7 General Skin  and Eye  Assessment s 
At Visit 1, the skin will be assessed to determine eligibility – no evidence of crusted scabies, 
normal skin in non -infested areas. At Visit s 1, and 2 , the skin and eye assessment s will include 
documentation  of presence or absence of irritation, and verbal verification  that the treatment 
topical suspension remained on for at least 6 hours before being washed off.  At Visit 3 /ET, skin 
and eye assessment s will include evidence of irritation.  
Eye irritation will be rated:  
0 no irritation  
1 mild scleral, lid and/or conjuncti va injection  
2 moderate scleral and or lid injection with conjunctival erythema  
3 severe scleral and/or lid injection with conjunctival erythema and purulent drainage  
7.8 Application of IP  
The bottle will  be weighed before and after application. One bottle of IP (blinded Natroba™ 
[spinosad ] or Placebo  control ) contains 4 -oz. of treatment product. The subject should use as 
much of one bottle as needed. The subject should apply a thin layer of IP from the neck down to 
the toes (including soles of the feet)  and to the scalp (if balding)  or hairline, temples, and 
forehead at their home on the same day it is dispensed on Visit 1 . The IP should be allowed to 
soak into the skin or dry for 10 minutes before getting dressed. Subjects less than 12 years of age  
shoul d be assisted with administration by a parent, guardian or caregiver. Showering or bathing 
should occur no earlier than 6 hours after treatment and no later than at least 1 hour before Visit 
2. 
Application of IP will occur in clinic for subjects in the PK population as follows. These subjects 
will be examined for the presence of veins that can withstand the insertion of a n intravenous (IV)  
catheter  with saline (preferable) or heparin lock , or be able to tolerate the multiple blood draws 
required by the PK component of the study  if an IV catheter cannot be established . Subjects will 
be admitted into a clinical environment on the day of product application (Day 1). If PK subject 
only has screen procedures on Day 1, then IP administration, PK blood draws and o ther 
procedures will be conducted on Day 2.  The product will be applied and will remain on the skin 
for at least 6 hours before bathing or showering.  The subjects will stay in the clinic until the 12 -
hour procedures are completed. The investigational site will provide a shower, food and

provided with sufficient water (or other age -appropriate fluids) to drink after each blood sample 
is taken in order to rehydrate an d maintain the use of the veins. If there are special dietary needs 
for subjects, parents/guardians will be asked to inform investigational site personnel and to bring 
the appropriate foods/drinks. When meal times coincide with the blood sampling schedule,  blood 
samples will be drawn prior to meals.  
7.9 Vital Signs  
Height  (Visit 1 only) , weight,  resting  blood  pressure  and heart  rate will be measured at Visit s 1 
and 3/ET. 
7.10 Pharmacokinetics  
A blood draw will be taken from subjects in the PK population just before IP application (t=0) 
and then at 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 6.0 and 12 hours. A ±5  minute time window will be allowed for all post -
treatment blood samples.  Showering should occur between  the 6 -hour and 12 -hour blood draw s. 
Actual blood draw times will be documented on the electronic Case Report Forms ( eCRFs).  
7.11 Eligibility Review  
Eligibility criteria will be reviewed at Visit 1 prior to randomization, and the subject should 
qualify prior to randomi zation.  
Screen Failure: A screen failure is defined as a subject who consented but who has not been 
randomized. Screen failures may re-screen after review and approval by the sponsor. Re-
screening may also be necessary due to timing/scheduling  or washout o f other treatment s (except 
scabicides which exclude the subject)  that may have occurred within the prior 4 weeks . 
7.12 Randomization and Treatment Assignment  
Eligible subjects will be assigned to either treatment group , Natroba™ (spinosad) or Placebo  
control, by pre -specified un -blinded site personnel  that may perform no other study specific 
duties. The un -blinded site personnel will assign all members from the same household to the 
same treatment group.  The assigned s ubject  numbers in each household will co rrespond to 
unique bottle numbers on a scheme that unblinded site personnel will assign and distribute to 
ensure approximately equal randomization of households to either treatment.  Subjects, blinded 
site personnel and ParaPRO LLC will remain blinde d to the treatment until after database lock.  
Randomization will be stratified by study site.

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  7.13 Counseling to Prevent Re -Infestation   
Subjects should be informed about methods to minimize risk of re -infestation: including 
avoiding skin contact with others wh o are infested and avoiding bedding or linens of an  infested  
person, and simultaneous treatment of all household contacts. The following information from 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used as reference:  
“When a person is infested with scabies mites the first time, symptoms may not appear for up to 
two months after being infested. However, an infested person can transmit scabies, even if they 
do not have symptoms. Scabies usually is passed by direct, prolonged skin -to-skin contact w ith 
an infested person. However, a person with crusted (Norwegian) scabies can spread the 
infestation by brief skin -to-skin contact or by exposure to bedding, clothing, or even furniture 
that he/she has used.  
Scabies is prevented by avoiding direct skin -to-skin contact with an infested person or with items 
such as clothing or bedding used by an infested person. Bedding and clothing worn or used next 
to the skin anytime during the 3 days before treatment should be machine washed and dried 
using the hot water  and hot dryer cycles or be dry -cleaned. Items that cannot be dry -cleaned or 
laundered can be disinfested by storing in a closed plastic bag for several days to a week. Scabies 
mites generally do not survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin. Chil dren and adults 
usually can return to child care, school, or work the day after treatment.”  
7.14 Prophylactic and Rescue 5% Permethrin  
All household members  that are not infested at the screening visit will be given the same blinded 
study treatment as household  members that are infested . PK subjects will be provided 5% 
Permethrin upon discharge to dispense to household members. Subjects not cured at Day 28 will 
be provided with 5% Permethrin  as rescue medication , which is the recommended treatment per 
the curren t standard of care , and will be directed to their primary care physician for follow -up. 
Subjects with an ET visit will not receive rescue medication and will be directed to their primary 
care physician for follow -up. 
7.15 Study Compliance  
Study compliance will be confirmed at Visit 2 in the primary population and in -clinic at Visit 1 
for the PK population . 
7.16 Laboratory Assessments and Procedures  
For the primary population, safety  laboratory assessments will  be made at Day 1 and Day 28/ET.

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  8 STATISTICAL METHODS  
8.1 Sample Size Determination  
For the primary efficacy analysis, approximately 120 “index” subjects will be enrolled (includ ing 
possible 20% attrition) from 120 households and randomized 1:1 to each of Natroba™ 
(spinosad) and Placebo  control. The index subject will be the youngest infested member of a 
household  (≥4 years).  Referencing to  the Sponsor’s Proof of Concept (POC) study (SPN -401-12) 
and published literature,5-10 out of 60 completed subjects , the cure  rate is 70% for Natroba™ and 
30% for Placebo  control .  Based upon  a reasonable  assumption  of 60% cure rate  for Natroba™  
and 30% for  placebo , a sample size of 48 study -completed “index” subjects per group will 
provide 8 0% power to declare the non -equivalency using a delta of 30% and Type I error rate of 
0.05.   Fisher exact test was used to calculate the sample size  and the specified power  in the  
following Table 8 -1 (PASS 14; 2015, NCSS, LLC., Kaysville, Utah, USA.  www.ncss.com ).

65% 30% 35% 37 80.6% 
Assuming a drop -out rate could be at most 2 0%, 120 subjects should guarantee at least 48 
evaluable subjects for each treatment group  at Day 28 assessment . 
An additional 24 subjects will be enrolled , which  is based on the previous PK studies perform ed 
on children 6 months to 15 years of age with head lice infestations, in which Natroba™ was 
administered as a single open -label topical treatment and PK sampling was performed over a 12 -
hour period. In the current study, 24 male and female subjects (4 -16 years of age) with scabies 
infestation will be enrolled: 12 male or female subjects 4 – 9 years of age (with a minimum of 6 
male or female subjects 4 – 6 years of age) and 12 male or female subjects 10 – 16 years of age. 
No formal power calculations were performed for the PK sample size.

This study  will investigate 2 treatment  groups: Natroba™  (spinosad)  Topical  Suspen sion, 0.9%  
and Placebo  control.  A rando mization  scheme will be used locally at each site  (stratified by study 
site) to obtain  a balanced  allocation of treatments (approximately 1:1) to the households.  
8.3 Analysis Populations  
Safety Population  
The safety population will comprise all subjects who received the adminis tration  of IP.  Subjects 
will be analyzed as treated. The safety population includes the “index” subjects along with any 
household members enrolled in the study as well as all subjects in the pediatric PK analysis. All 
safety analyses will utilize the safety population. It is assumed that approximately 384 subjects 
will be enrolled and receive  one administration  of IP : 120 “index” subjects and 240 “non -index” 
subjects from the primary population, and 24 “non -index” subjects from the pediatric PK 
population .  
Intent -to-Treat Population  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will comprise all primary population subjects who were 
randomized . Subjects will be analyzed as randomized.  This population includes the index 
subjects along with any household members enrolled in the stud y. 
Index Intent -to-Treat Population  
The “index” intent -to-treat ( I-ITT) population will comprise all index subjects who were 
randomized . Subjects will be analyzed as randomized. T he index subject will be the youngest 
infested member of a household  (≥4 year s). This analysis population will be used for the efficacy 
analys es.   
Index Per Protocol Population  
The “index” Per Protocol (I -PP) population is a subset of the I -ITT population. Index subjects 
will be excluded from the I -PP population for the following reasons:  
1. Protocol deviations that would be in violation with the established Inclusion or 
Exclusion Criteria.  
2. Protocol deviations that could confound the evaluation of efficacy outcomes:  
o Scabies assessment not performed (i.e. burrows, lesions, pruritis, s kin 
scraping) .  
o Subject received the wrong treatment.  
o Discontinuation prior to acquisition of Visit 3 (Day 28) efficacy 
measurements.

o Missed Day 2 appointment.  
o Use of another scabicide during the study.  
o Use of prescription or OTC medicated lotions during the study.  
Prior to database lock, a memo will be generated identifying any subjects that were excluded 
from the I -PP population along with the reason why they were excluded.  
Pharmacokin etic population  
The PK population comprises all pediatric PK subjects who (or parent/guardian) give 
consent, are eligible and had blood drawn for PK assessment.  No other populations will be 
used for the PK analyses.  
8.4 Missing Values  
There will be no imputation for missing events and assessments in handling safety data.  
If a subject has observed data for complete cure at Day 28, the observed cases (OC) will be used 
at Day 28.  If a subject discontinues the study before Day 28, the imputation method for 
complete cure at Day 28 depends on the reasons of missing, i.e. informative or non -informative 
missing. Please refer to the SAP for more details.   
For other missing efficacy data at Day 28 (e.g., clinical cure, microscopic cure, new l esions and 
total lesions), Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) imputation will be used.  
Details of imputation rule s for efficacy analyses and other missing data handling conventions 
will be included in the SAP.  
8.5 Statistical Analyses  
A statistical analy sis plan (SAP), in addition to this section of the study protocol, will describe 
statistical methodology for analyses  and data reporting. A  version of the  SAP will be prepared  at 
the same time as the protocol  is finalized . However, the primary and secondar y efficacy 
endpoints and analyses on them will not be altered unless agreed upon with the FDA. SAP will 
be finalized before the database is unblinded.  
Data collected in this study will be presented using summary tables, figures, and subject data 
listings. Summary tables will present data by treatment group and, if applicable, by scheduled 
time of data collection. Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, 
presenting  the number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum , and maximum. 
Categorical variables will be summarized by frequencies and percentages. Figures may be used 
to support the presentation of certain data.

All statistical tests and confidence intervals will be 2 -sided at an alpha level of 0.05.  
8.5.1  Subject Disposition  
The tabulation of number of subjects in each treatment group and overall will be displayed for all 
subjects who  are screened, randomized, and in each analysis population.   
The number and percent of subjects who completed or discontinued the study will be displayed 
for each treatment group and overall together with reasons for early termination. Percentages will 
be based on the total number of randomized subjects in each treatment group and overall.  
8.5.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive  statistics  will be provided  for demographic  and baseline  characteristics  (gender,  age, 
race/ethnicity, baseline assess ments of scabies  infestatio n, previous infestations, and microscopic 
results ).  
8.5.3 Efficacy Analyses  
8.5.3.1 Primary Efficacy  Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of index subjects completely  cured of scabies by 
Day 28.  Complete cure is defined as demonstration of clinical cure (all signs and symptoms have 
completely resolved, including burrows, inflammatory/non -inflammatory lesions and pruritus) 
and microscopic or dermatoscopic cure with demonstration of the absence of mites, eggs, and/or 
scybala, and dermatoscopy negative for burrows.  
The primary analysis will be based  on the data by Day 28 from the I-ITT population . The 
number  and percentage of index subjects who exhibit complete cure (Yes or No)  at Day 28  will 
be summ arized  by treat ment group. A Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel general association test adjusted 
by study site  (small sites pooled) stratification will be performed to compare the complete cure 
rates between  the two treat ment groups.  
Sensitivity analyses will be performed on the primary efficacy endpoint to evaluate the 
robustness of the results using different methods of analysis.  
A logistic regression analysis will be used assessing the treatment group differences.  The model  
will include clinical site and treat ment group as factors, and possibly additional  baseline 
characteristics  or a covariate , if appropriate .

8.5.3.2   Secondary Analysis  
The se condary endpoint is the pharmacokinetics (PK) of spinosad and benzyl alcohol following a 
single dose of Natroba™ in pediatr ic subjects 4 -16 years of age.   Estimation of PK parameters, 
i.e. Cmax, Tmax, and AUC 0-12h  will be computed with noncompartmental methods for each 
subject.   Cmax and Tmax are direct measurements of the maximum observed concentration and the 
time to reach the C max respectively during the first dosing cycle . 
Descriptive summaries of the plasma concentration levels for both spinosad and  benzyl alcohol 
observed at each nominal time point will be provided. Descriptive summaries of the 
pharmacokinetic parameter estimates will also be completed. Summary statistics for continuous 
variables will include n umber of non -missing observations , mean , standard deviation, coefficient 
of variation (CV%), median, minimum, and maximum, geometric mean and standard error of the 
geometric mean . 
8.5.3.3 Exploratory Efficacy  
All exploratory efficacy endpoints will be summarized by the treatment group  at each s cheduled 
visit.   Desc riptive statistics for continuous variables consists of mean, standard deviation (SD), 
median, min imum, and maximum. For categorical variables, numbers and percentages will be 
summarized.  
Additional analysis may be performed as appropriate for the following exploratory efficacy 
endpoints.   
Clinical Cure  
Clinical cure is defined as having all signs and symptoms completely resolved, including 
inflammatory/non -inflammatory lesions and pruritu s. 
The number and percent of subjects who exhibit clinical cure (Yes or No) at Day 28 will be 
presented by treatment group.  A Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted by study site (small 
sites pooled) stratification will be performed to compare the complete  cure rates between the two 
treatment groups.   
This analysis will be performed on the I -ITT population .   
Microscopic Cure  
Microscopic cure is defined as microscopic or dermatoscopic demonstration of  the absence  of 
mites, eggs, and/ or scybala , and negativ e for burrows.

presented by treatment group.  
Additional analyses can be performed on the I -ITT population by applying a logistic regression 
model adjusted for baseline factors.  
Number of New  Lesions  
The number of new lesions at Day 28 will be analyzed using  a negative binomial regression 
model  to compare the treatment difference . The model will include treatment group and study 
site (small sites pooled) as fixed factors, and baseline total lesion count as a covariate.   
This analysis will be performed on the I -ITT population .  
Total Lesion  Counts  
Total lesion counts will be calcu lated as the sum of pre -existing lesions and new lesions. The 
baseline captures the  total lesions  on the day of first study drug administration .  
The change from baseline to Day 28 will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model with treatm ent and study site (small sites pooled) as factors and baseline total 
lesion counts as a covariate.  
This analysis will be performed on the I -ITT population .  
Complete Cure in ITT subjects who were infested at baseline  
A subset of subjects in ITT populatio n who were infested at baseline will be summarized to 
display the proportion of the completely cured subjects.  
More analysis can be performed to further examine the treatment differences for this subset of 
ITT subjects. Details will be provided in the SAP.    
8.5.3.4 Pooling of Study Sites  
This is a study conducted at multiple study sites.  Every e ffort will be made to have each site 
enroll at least 8 subjects per arm.  In case there are  “small” sites with few er-than-8 “index” 
subjects , these sites will be  pooled together as a single, combined site for efficacy analyses if the 
combined site has at least 8 “index” subject s per arm .  In the situation when the combined site 
still has less than 8 “index” subjects per arm, the smallest site with at least 8 “inde x” subjects per 
arm will be pooled to this combined site for efficacy analyses.  The complete cure rates at Day 
28 will be summarized descriptively by treatment groups and by sites before and after pooling 
the sites.  Assessment of site -to-site variability  will be conducted on the original sites prior to 
pooling.  In addition, the above demographics and baseline characteristics will be presented by 
site before and after pooling the sites.

9.1 Definition  
An AE is defined  as any untoward  medic al occurrence  in a subject  or clinical  investigation  (lab 
assay, physical change,  etc.) following  the subject’s  first dose of IP that does not necessarily  
have  a causal relationship  with this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable  or unintended  
sign (including  an abnor mal finding  on lab assays, vital signs , etc.), symptom,  or disease  
temporally  associated  with the use of an IP, whet her or not related  to the IP. 
This includes  any adverse occurrence  that is new in onset or aggravate d in severit y, duration  or 
frequency  from  the baseline  condition  (including  the physi cal examination),  or abnor mal results  
of diagnostic  procedures  (including  laboratory  test abnor malities).  
Examples of untoward medical events  that should  be considered  AEs are those that : 
• result ed in discontinuation  from  the study,  
• require d treatment or any other  thera peutic  intervention,  
• require d further  diagnostic  evaluation  (excludin g a repetitio n of the same 
procedure  to confirm  the abnor mality), 
• are associated  with clinical  signs  or symptoms judged  by the Investigator  to 
have  a significant  clinical impact.  
Examples of what an AE is not: 
• A surgica l procedure  
• A situation  where  an untoward  event  did not occur,  (e.g. a social  hospitalization)  
• The disease  being  studied,  unless  progress ion is more sever e than anticipated  
• Lack of efficacy 
• Baseline  conditions  that have  not worsene d in severit y or frequency  
• Abnormal laboratory  findings or test results (unless considered clinically significant 
in the opinion of the investigator  or specifically defined elsewhere in the protocol ) 
related to the disease  being  studied  (unless  more severe  than expecte d). 
9.2 Procedures  
Subjects will be que ried at every visit through  the last visit regarding the occurrence and nature 
of any AEs. All AEs will be reported, whether or not they are deemed to be related to IP.

ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  A description of the event or diagnosis including dates, severity, relationship to the IP, action 
taken and outcome, and whether or not the event was also serious, must be reported on the AE 
CRF for each adverse event recorded in the subject’s chart.  
9.3 Sever ity 
Adverse events are graded according to seriousness and severity.  The seriousness of an event is 
determined by the regulatory criteria in Section  9.7.  
The Investigator will evaluate the severity  of each AE. Adverse event  severity  will be graded as  
Mild:    Awareness of symptoms but easily tolerated  
Moderate:  Discomfort enough to interfere with but not prevent daily activity  
Severe:  Unable to perform usual activity  
9.4 Relationship  
The Investigator will judge the likelihood that the AE was related to th e IP according to the 
following criteria : 
• Not related: There is no temporal and/or causal relationship to the IP. 
• Related: There is a possible temporal and/or causal relationship to the IP. 
9.5 Action Taken  and Outcome  
The Action Taken with IP for every AE wil l be reported as Dose Not Changed or Dose 
Withdrawn. The Outcome of each AE will be entered as either: Recovered/Resolved, 
Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae, Not Recovered/Not Resolved, Fatal, or Unknown.  
9.6 Adverse Event Follow -up 
Investigators will follow unrelated AEs until the final study visit (Day 14 or Day 28).  All SAEs, 
and AEs deemed by the Investigator to be related to IP or treatment , will be followed until the 
event has resolved.  
9.7 Serious Adver se Events  
An AE that results in any of the following outcomes  is serious : 
• Death (note that death is the outcome of an SAE  and the cause of death should be listed as 
the AE)  
• Life-threatening event . An event, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, which 
places the patient or subject at immediate ri sk of death. (It does not include an adverse event

• Congenital  anomaly or birth  defect  
• Other  important  medical  event  that may not result  in death,  be life-threatening,  or require  
hospitalization  may be considered  serious  when,  based  upon  appropriate  medical  
judgment, it may jeopardize  the subject or may require  medical  or surgical  intervention  to 
preve nt one of the outco mes listed  in this definition.  
Hospitalization  for elective  surgery  for a prior condition  that did not worsen  or for soci al 
reasons will not be treated as serious . 
9.7.1  Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Any SAE  which  occurs after the first dose is administered  until the last visit must be reported  to 
Concentrics Research  whether  or not it is judged  related  to the IP. Concentrics Research  must be

Page 58 of 66 
ParaPRO, LLC  Confidential  For example, under this definition,  hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater 
severity) if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. 
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of 
greater  specificity) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. 
"Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a c lass of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned 
as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.”  
The study sponsor will expedite reporting all serious unexpected suspected adver se reactions 
(SUSARs): initial reporting by the sponsor for nonfatal or non -life-threatening SUSARs must be 
submitted as soon as possible but no later than within 15 calendar days following the sponsor’s 
initial receipt of the information, and for fatal or  life-threatening SUSARs, initial reports must be 
submitted no later than 7 calendar days following the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. 
Any relevant additional information obtained by the sponsor that pertains to a previously submitted 
IND sa fety report must be submitted as a Follow -up IND Safety Report without delay as soon as 
the information is available but no later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor receives the 
information.  
Such expedited reports will comply with the applicable regul atory requirements and with the 
FDA’s Guidance for Industry and Investigators Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and 
BA/BE Studies  (21 CFR 312.32 ). 
9.9 Pregnancy  
If a subject becomes pregnant during the study, the investigator must notify the Medical Monit or 
immediately upon learning of the pregnancy.  The outcome of any pregnancies occurring on the 
study must be followed up to term.  The investigator will be provided with a Pregnancy Outcome 
Form by the Medical Monitor.  This form must be completed fully a nd returned to the Medical 
Monitor. Any spontaneous miscarriage or congenital anomaly or birth defect must be recorded as 
a Serious Adverse Event and full details will be requested. Any complications during pregnancy

13.2 Electronic Case Report Forms  
Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) will be used in this study. The Investigator is responsible 
for the quality of the data recorded in the eCRF. The data recorded should be a complete and 
accurate account of the subject’s record collected during the study.  
The Investigator and other staff who have been delegated responsibility for entering data into t he 
eCRF at each visit will be trained in the use of the eCRFs before the first subject at that site is 
enrolled. The Investigator must review all entries for completeness and correctness. The 
electronic data capture system will keep an audit trail of all c hanges made after the eCRF pages 
are initially completed and submitted.  The study monitor will review the eCRFs for 
completeness and adherence to the protocol.

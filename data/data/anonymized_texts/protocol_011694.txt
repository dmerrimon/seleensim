 Approximately 56 children were planned to be 
randomized into the study, assuming a dropout rate 
of 10 -13%. After a blinded sample size  re-estimation 
(SSRE), the protocol was amended to allow 
enrollment of between 56 and 66 children 
randomized into the study, if feasible.   
 
 
 
The study will have 5 distinct phases:  
• Screening  Subjects will be 
screened to ensure adherence to eligibility 
criteria.  
• 
• Double -blind  dose run-in (  
 
 
Subjects randomized at  (Baseline) to the 
weight adjusted 1000 mg dose level will take 
tideglusib at a weight adjusted 400 mg dose level 
from weeks , then they will take tideglusib at 
a weight adjusted 600 mg dose level from weeks 
 and thereafter they will take tideglusib at a 
weight adjusted 1000 mg dose level from weeks 
. Subjects randomized at  (Baseline) to 
placebo will remain on that treatment for weeks 
 
• Double -blind  maintenance  (Weeks  . 
Subjects will continue on the fixed  dose  of  
1000 mg weight adjusted tideglusib or placebo, 
which they have been previously randomized to 
for  
• Follow -up Period (Weeks  for those 
subjects not participating in the extension study

Due to the global COVID -19 (Coronavirus Disease 
2019) pandemic and the potential for resurgences of 
COVID -19, for the purposes of this protocol, ‘in - 
clinic’ visits, when pertaining to Visits  Visi  
(Weeks , may be conducted via a combination 
of telehealth and home healthcare providers in the 
event COVID -19 related reasons, e.g. institutional 
restrictions, travel restrictions, quarantine or 
shielding,  prevent  subjects  from  being  seen in-person 
at the investigator site. Home healthcare visits will 
not be conducted if the subject or a member of the 
family present in the home has, or is suspected to 
have,  COVID -19. 
 
Data Safety Monitoring Committee  
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC) consisting of clinical and other experts will 
be established by the Sponsor to review safety 
findings  during  the study  and to help ensure  the well- 
being of  enrollees .

SAFETY  ASSESSMENTS  This study will compare the incidence of  adverse  
events (AE), including serious adverse events 
(SAE), between Screening and end of treatment with 
weight adjusted 1000 mg tideglusib versus  placebo,  
for . The incidence of abnormal findings in  
objective assessments (e.g. clinical laboratory 
values, urinalysis, physical examination findings,

 These associations may be statistically tested 
using correlation coefficients and general linear 
models, if appropriate.  
 
 
STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS  Details of all planned analyses will be specified in  a 
separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) which will be 
finalized prior to hard -lock of the study database.  
The SAP will contain details of all the analyses 
including specifications for all tables, listings and 
figures. All statistical programming will be 
performed using SAS software.  
Estimated Sample Size:  
No clinical trial data are available on the CDM1 -RS 
instrument. Twenty -five subjects per group will 
generate 70% power to detect the effect size of 0.6 
at the 0.1 two -sided significance level. This sample 
size will also be sufficient to generate 80% power to 
detect the effect size of 0.82 at the 0.05 two -sided 
significance level. Accounting for a 10% -13% drop- 
out rate, approximately 28 subjects per group will be 
enrolled. A blinded sample size re -estimation 
(SSRE), based on the observed variance in the 
primary outcome measure, was performed once 33% 
of subjects had been enrolled and had completed 
. The effect size assumptions were partially 
based on the Clinician VAS (  
 total score changes from baseline 
to end of study (6 points on drug vs. 1 point on 
placebo with the common standard deviation of 5.8). 
Based on these and other data, 29 and 22 subjects 
per group will be sufficient to generate 90% and 
80% power at the 0.05 two -sided significance level. 
Based on these calculations, a suggested sample size 
of approximately 56 patients total was deemed to  be

AMO Pharma Ltd.  
Protocol Number:

02 FEB 2023  Page 18 of 161   
 adequate to detect the treatment effect or at least a 
consistent trend.  
Based on the blinded SSRE, the planned sample size 
is sufficient to detect the treatment difference 
between active and control arms based on the 
primary endpoint with at least 80% power at the  
0.05 two sided significance level. However, the 
variability of the key secondary endpoint was 
slightly greater than that originally assumed. 
Respectively, it was recommended, if operationally 
feasible, to increase the total sample size to a 
maximum of 66 subjects.  
Statistical Methods for Safety : 
Analysis of safety will be performed based on the 
Safety Analysis Set (SAS). See section 11.2 for 
definition.  All AEs will be coded  using  the MedDRA 
dictionary and will be summarized by  treatment.  
Other safety data, including laboratory, vital signs 
and ECG values including change from baseline will 
be summarized.  
Statistical Methods for Efficacy:  
Primary and key secondary analyses of efficacy will 
be based on the Intent to Treat (ITT) population. 
Other efficacy analyses will be performed based on 
the Full Analysis Set (FAS). See section 11.2 for 
definitions.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be calculated at 
each time point as a total score based on 11 domain 
ratings. Changes from Baseline  to post - 
treatment visits will be summarized by treatment 
group at each study visit. For the CGI -I the observed 
values will be summarized.  
Change from baseline to end of treatment will be 
analysed using general linear model. Improvement 
during the run -in period may be included as 
a covariate. The statistical significance of changes

 from baseline over time may also be assessed using 
the linear mixed effects repeated measures model.  
Due to COVID -19 related restrictions some of the 
data at certain visits may be collected using a 
telehealth approach while other data may be 
collected during in -clinic visits. To evaluate the 
consistency of telehealth data and in -clinic data for 
the CDM1 -RS and CGI rating scales and to 
minimize the potential bias, Baseline ( , Week  
( ) and Week ) visits will be performed 
using both in -clinic and telehealth data collection 
approaches. Analysis to evaluate the consistency of 
these two methods of data collection will be 
performed.  
According to the recommendations in the FDA 
Guidance “Statistical Considerations for Clinical 
Trials During the COVID -19 Public Health 
Emergency”, sensitivity analyses will be performed 
in addition to the primary analysis (FDA, 2020). The 
sensitivity analyses will include combined use of 
telehealth and in -clinic data; the impact of using 
telehealth data on outcomes will be evaluated.  
The exploratory endpoint analysis will be outlined in 
the SAP. The details of the analysis methods will be 
determined after exploratory endpoint data review.

5. BACKGROUND  INFORMATION  
5.1 Myotonic  dystrophy  
Myotonic dystrophy is a monogenetic disorder caused by  non-coding expansion repeats in 
the DMPK  gene  (myotonic  dystrophy  type 1 or adult  onset  DM1  or Steinert  disease),  which 
is located on chromosome 19, or the CNBP gene (myotonic dystrophy type 2 or DM2), 
which is located on chromosome 3. There are no symptomatic or disease -modifying 
treatments approved for the treatment of individuals with myotonic  dystrophy.  
DM1 may be present at birth (Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy), appear during childhood 
(Childhood Myotonic Dystrophy) or during adulthood (Classic Adult onset Myotonic 
Dystrophy and Late onset Myotonic Dystrophy).  
Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy (Congenital DM1) is a life threatening disorder, with a 
mortality rate of 25 percent by age 1.5 years and 50 percent by age 30 years (Reardon et 
al., 1993). This study reported that 50 percent of subjects were unable to walk unaided 
with 4 percent of subjects requiring wheelchairs. Less than a quarter of Congenital DM1 
patients were able to attend mainstream schooling due to intellectual disability, 15  percent 
were still fecally incontinent at 5 years of age and in patients who lived  to 20 years of age, 
79 percent were unemployed. Complementary data were reported by Ekström et al., 
(2009), who noted learning disabilities in 95 and 89 percent of Congenital and Childhood 
DM1 patients, respectively. Ekström et al., (2008) also reported that 68 percent and 50 
percent, respectively, of individuals with Congenital and Childhood DM1 had an Autism 
Spectrum Disorder  (ASD).  
Current practice distinguishes between congenital, infantile, juvenile, adult, and late onset 
forms (Dogan et al., 2016) of DM1. The condition is a multi -system disorder that affects 
muscle, brain, the heart, and liver amongst other organs. When DM1 has an onset in early 
adulthood, presentation is primarily characterized by a progressive distal weakness of the 
hands  and arms,  myotonia  and excessive  daytime  sleepiness  (Heatwole  et al., 2012).  Adult 
onset  DM1  is associated  with increased  mortality,  with mean  survival  age reported  to be in 
the range of 55.4 years (Mathieu et al., 1999) to 60 years (de Die -Smulders et al.,  1998).  
Congenital DM1 is distinct from all other forms of DM1 in both time of onset, severity of 
disease, and genetic presentation.  
• The expansion repeat size in individuals with Congenital DM1 is typically 
significantly larger than individuals with juvenile - or adult onset forms of DM1 
(Ekström et al.,  2008).  
• The congenital onset form of DM1 is by definition diagnosable at birth due to the 
presence of characteristic clinical signs that are not present in DM1 with onset at 
other ages (Genevieve et al., 2015).

• In particular, the CNS features of Congenital DM1 are much more severe than 
juvenile or adult onset forms. Almost all individuals with Congenital DM1 have 
intellectual disability, which is not the case with juvenile DM1 (Ekström et al., 
2008).  
• Also, characteristic neuromuscular and skeletomuscular features, described below, 
are evident at birth in Congenital  DM1.  
• Congenital DM1 can be distinguished at the molecular and histological level. 
Congenital  DM1  is associated  with RNA  splicing  variants  that are not present  in the 
adult onset form (Thomas et al., 2017). The presentation of muscle cell types in 
Congenital DM1 is different to that in juvenile and adult onset DM1 (Nakamori et 
al., 2017).  
Congenital DM1 may be a disorder in which muscle fibers fail to develop at the 
microscopic level, being therefore a developmental disorder. Adult onset DM1 can be 
considered  a degenerative  disorder  of muscle,  whose  histopathological  features  may appear 
in adulthood  in Congenital  DM1.  The genomic  lesions  in Congenital  DM1  and Adult -onset 
DM1 may differ in respect somatic  instability.  
The hallmark clinical stigmata of neonates with Congenital DM1 include hypotonia, 
generalized weakness, respiratory insufficiency, feeding difficulties, and clubfoot or 
another musculoskeletal deformity. As infancy and young childhood progress, Congenital 
DM1 is associated with pronounced and unremitting oral facial weakness including 
diminished lip strength, respiratory difficulties, characteristic facies, often profound 
intellectual disability and behavioral disorders akin to ASD (Johnson et al., 2016).  These 
features are not central to Adult -onset DM1 which is associated with signs and symptoms 
that arise  later in life, and in which  fatigue,  daytime  sleepiness  and milder  cognitive  deficits 
are associated with distal and proximal muscle weakness as well as  myotonia.  
As described previously, Congenital DM1 is associated with significant morbidity and 
mortality; life expectancy is significantly shortened with 25 percent of affected patients 
deceased by 18 months and less than 50 percent surviving to 30 years of age. Life - 
expectancy may be decreased in Adult -onset DM1 but to a lesser degree.  
 
 
5.2 Tideglusib  
Tideglusib (4 -benzyl -2-naphtalen -1-yl-1,2,4 -thiadiazolidine -3,5-dione) is a new chemical 
entity (NCE) from the thiadiazolidindiones chemical family. It is an irreversible inhibitor 
of Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK -3 β). 
Tideglusib is a brain penetrant and can be orally administered. The IMP is ‘tideglusib for 
oral suspension’. It

GSK -3 is a serine/threonine  protein  kinase  enzyme  that recently  emerged  as a key target  in 
drug discovery. GSK -3 has two isoforms – GSK -3α and GSK -3β. GSK -3β is implicated 
in neuromuscular and neurodevelopmental disorders. GSK -3β is highly expressed in 
muscle cells as well as in brain cells (Woodgett, 1990), is important in central nervous 
system (CNS) ontology (Beurel et al. , 2012) and is a key signaling element in activity 
dependent synaptic plasticity (Rui et al.,  2013).  
Signaling downstream of the insulin receptor is disrupted in DM1, given the significant 
splicing mis -regulation of the insulin receptor itself. Prior therapeutic trials (Heatwole, et 
al., 2011) have focused on upregulating the insulin signal itself. The current approach 
targets the disrupted signaling downstream of the insulin receptor, at the GSK -3β site.  
Jones et al ., reported in 2012 that GSK -3β mediates muscle pathology in myotonic 
dystrophy  based  on increased  GSK -3β activity  in DM1  expressing  cell lines,  muscle  biopsy  
samples from DM1 expressing transgenic mice and DM1 patient tissue samples. 
Tideglusib has also been shown to interact directly with an RNA construct containing the 
DMPK gene CUG repeat formed as a hairpin. Administration of tideglusib is also 
associated  with fragmentation  of the mutant  DMPK  gene  RNA  in Congenital  DM1  patient 
tissue and reduction of DMPK gene RNA foci in muscle from the HSALR mouse (Wang  et 
al 2019). Further, tideglusib reverses deficits in myodifferentiation of Congenital DM1 
myoblasts in vitro . Tideglusib also significantly attenuates abnormalities in total levels 
and splice variants of key effectors such as BIN1 and SERCA1 in Congenital DM1 tissue 
in vitro  and the HSALR transgenic  mouse  model  of DM1  (

safety of tideglusib in children and adolescents ages 6 -16 years, affected by Congenital 
DM1.

5.5 Rationale for this  Study  
There are currently no approved pharmacological treatments for individuals with DM1. 
Moreover, Congenital DM1 is a rare disease with a high mortality rate and as such has a 
significant unmet need for the development of pharmacological treatments. As described 
in Section 5.3, there is both pre -clinical and in-vitro clinical evidence to suggest that 
inhibition of GSK -3 could have the potential to reverse myotonia and improve muscle 
weakness in patients with Congenital DM1. Similarly, there is affirming preclinical 
evidence from neurodevelopmental models that suggest that tideglusib may have the 
potential to improve the associated neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms 
associated with DM1. This will be the first randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
study of a GSK -3 inhibitor in children and adolescents with Congenital DM1. The 
following factors are taken into account:  
 
Dose:  
The dose of tideglusib that will be utilized in this study is within the dose range, and the 
weight -adjustment dosing strategy, that was implemented in the aforementioned  Canadian 
TIDE study in children and adolescents with ASD. The doses for the TIDE study and for 
this study were selected based upon preclinical efficacy pharmacology studies as well as 
the safety data from prior clinical  studies.

Clinical studies in adults have shown that chronic administration of an  oral  dose of  
1000 mg tideglusib for six months or greater is generally safe and well  tolerated.  
In the recently completed AMO -02-MD-2-001 study, the study drug was well tolerated 
with all 16 subjects enrolled completing the study, and no early discontinuations or dose 
adjustments required. There were no SAEs or suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs) reported during the study and no serious AEs related to drug. There 
were no systematic irregularities in objective assessments (e.g. vital signs, ECGs, 
laboratory assessments).

Duration:  
Based on data from a natural history study of this population and in consideration of the 
type of improvements anticipated to be measured, a duration of weeks of treatment  has 
been selected to investigate the effects of tideglusib on existing signs and symptoms. The 
effects  of tideglusib  and analogues  on transgenic  mouse  models  of myotonic  dystrophy  and 
on abnormal  differentiation  of Congenital  DM1  muscle  tissue  in vitro  revealed  rapid  onset 
following acute dosing. The time course over which tideglusib or any other 
pharmacological agent may demonstrate efficacy in ameliorating the symptoms of 
Congenital DM1 has not yet been  established.

6. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND  PURPOSE  
6.1 Primary  Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, from baseline to end of 
treatment, of weight adjusted 1000 mg tideglusib compared to placebo in children and 
adolescents with Congenital DM1 as measured by the Clinician -Completed Congenital 
DM1 Rating Scale (CDM1 -RS). 
6.2 Secondary  Objectives  
Secondary Objectives of this study are:  
• To evaluate  the safety  and tolerability  of weight  adjusted  1000  mg tideglusib  compared 
to placebo in children and adolescents with Congenital  DM1  
• To evaluate  the efficacy,  from  baseline  to end of treatment,  of weight  adjusted  1000 mg 
tideglusib compared to placebo in children and adolescents with Congenital DM1 as 
measured by clinician -completed, caregiver -completed rating scales, functional 
assessments, and biomarker/physiological  assessments  
• To evaluate the blood pharmacokinetics of tideglusib and its main metabolite 
(NP04113) after repeat dosing in children and adolescents with Congenital  DM1  
• To evaluate  the consistency  of telehealth  data and in-clinic  data for the CDM1 -RS and 
CGI rating  scales  
 
7. SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF  SUBJECTS  
7.1 Subject  Numbers  
Approximately 56 children were planned to be randomized into the study, assuming a 
dropout rate of 10 -13%. After a blinded sample size re -estimation (SSRE), the protocol 
was amended  to allow  enrollment  of between  56 and 66 children  randomized  into the study, 
if feasible.  
 
Randomization will occur in a 1:1 manner such that each treatment group will have 
approximately 28 subjects (assuming a 10 -13% drop -out rate) contributing data to the 
primary  efficacy  analysis.  Randomization  will be stratified  by age at the time of screening.

7.4 Withdrawal  Criteria  
A subject should be withdrawn from treatment if they meet the discontinuation criteria in 
section 9.5. If a subject is discontinued at any time after Run -in , the investigator will 
make  every  effort  to see the subject  and complete  the EOT  visit as soon  as possible  (ideally 
within 72 hours) after being discontinued from IMP treatment and then attend the follow - 
up visit,  after final dose.  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time without stating a reason and without 
prejudice to further treatment. The Investigator may withdraw a subject from the study 
and discontinue study treatment and assessments at any time.

Early  discontinuation  of any subject  who has given  informed  consent  to participate  will be 
recorded including the reason for discontinuation. The primary reason for a subject 
withdrawing prematurely will be selected from the following standard categories of early 
discontinuations:  
• Failed to meet enrollment  criteria.  
• Adverse Event : Clinical events occurred or laboratory results are reported that in the 
medical judgment of the investigator are grounds for discontinuation in the best 
interests of the  subject.  
• Withdrawal of Consent: The subject desired to withdraw from further participation 
in the study.  The subject  is not obliged  to provide  any reason  for withdrawal  of consent, 
but where a reason is given this will be recorded on the  CRF.  
• Protocol Violation: The subject failed to adhere to the protocol requirements, at the 
investigator’s discretion e.g. the subject requires initiating a medication from the 
prohibited  medications  list or is consistently  noncompliant  with the pre- and post-dose 
food restrictions  
• Pregnancy: The subject has either a positive urine or serum pregnancy test during  the 
study.  
• Lost to Follow -Up: The subject stopped coming for visits and study personnel were 
unable to contact the subject or caregiver. Every effort should be made to re -contact 
the subject prior to declaring a subject as lost to follow -up, which must be at least 3 
documented  attempts.  The 3rd must  be in writing  and confirmed  to have  been  received 
(e.g. registered  post).  
• Other: The subject was terminated for a reason other than those listed above, such as 
theft or loss of study drugs or termination of study by  Sponsor.

In the event a combined telehealth and home healthcare visit is required, or unscheduled 
visits as outlined in section 9.5, the following endpoints and procedures may be impacted, 
as follows:  
• Clinician completed assessments (i.e. CDM1 -RS, CGI -I, CGI -S, Vineland 
Adaptive Behavior Scale and ABI -C) will be completed via  telehealth  
• Caregiver -completed  assessments  (i.e. Top 3 Caregiver  Concerns  VAS,  CC-MDHI 
and CC -CDM1 -RS) will be completed remotely in the subject’s  home  
• 10-meter walk -run test: will not be collected as it is unable to be completed safely 
in a subject’s  home  
• Lip strength assessment will not be able to be completed as specialized 
physiotherapists are unavailable for home healthcare  visits  
• Grip strength assessment will not be able to be completed as specialized 
physiotherapists are unavailable for home healthcare  visits  
• NIH toolbox assessments (i.e. Dimensional Change Card Sort Test and Picture 
Sequence  Memory  Test)  and the Peabody  Picture  Vocabulary  Test (PPVT)  will not 
be completed as telehealth administration is non -standard administration for these 
tests. Sensitivity analyses on the primary, key secondary and one secondary 
endpoint to support telehealth administration are intended to be performed, and 
therefore additional sensitivity analyses for these exploratory tests will not be 
performed.  
• DXA scan: will need to be completed locally or may be unable to be  completed  
samples will be unable to be processed outside of a clinical 
laboratory, and therefore will not be collected  
• Physical  examinations  will not be able to be completed  outside  of the clinic  setting. 
If a subject  is unable  to complete  Week  in-clinic,  a physical  exam  will be 
completed  locally.  
• Vital signs, height and weight will be collected remotely in the subject’s home 
using an AMO approved home healthcare  vendor  
• Safety  laboratory  and urinalysis  samples  will be collected  remotely  in the subject’s 
home using an AMO approved home healthcare  vendor  
• Pregnancy testing will be completed via a serum sample collected by an AMO 
approved home healthcare  vendor  
• The standard 12 -lead ECG will be replaced with a 6 -lead ECG using equipment 
provided  by the central  ECG  vendor  and completed  in the subject’s  home  using  an 
AMO approved home healthcare  vendor

unused IMP returned via arranged shipment to the investigator  site 
 
Home  healthcare  visits  will not be conducted  if local  restrictions  prohibit  it or if the subject 
or a member of the family present in the home has, or is suspected to have, COVID -19, 
and those assessments will not be completed. The details of telehealth and in -clinic data 
assessment are outlined in the  SAP.  
 
 
8.4 DSMC  
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) consisting of clinical and 
other experts will be established by the Sponsor to review safety findings during the  study 
and to help ensure subject safety. The DSMC will form a Charter prior to their first data 
review; that Charter will include a description of the Committee, the Members and their 
responsibilities,  timing  of the reviews,  and considerations  for any statistical  items  (e.g. data 
displays) that may be required for the data  reviews.  
The DSMC will meet quarterly to review safety and tolerability data for the total study 
population. The DSMC review will be unblinded. The DSMC will make a 
recommendation to either proceed with the protocol with no modification or may suggest 
changes to the protocol. Based on the results of their data reviews, the DSMC will submit 
its recommendations in written form to the Sponsor who is responsible for responding to 
the recommendations of the DSMC and to take appropriate action.

 ideally  within   from  the subject,  and 
if these clinical labs are collected during an in -clinic visit should also conduct a brief 
physical examination, collect vital signs, collect  PK sample when possible, and 
check for any AEs or changes to concomitant medications. The investigator should also 
assess the need for continued follow -up before the next appointment, as  appropriate.

9.6 Treatment Accountability and Compliance  Checks  
In accordance with regulatory requirements, the Investigator or designated site staff must 
document the amount of IMP dispensed and/or administered to study subjects, the  amount 
returned by study subjects, and the amount received from and returned to the Sponsor (or 
representative) when applicable. Product accountability records must be maintained 
throughout the course of the  study.  
Every  effort  should  be made  to collect  cartons  and unused  packets  of IMP from  the subjects 
at each visit to allow for accountability and for compliance to be checked. It is essential 
that subjects  and caregivers  are given  information  not to use medication  from  the previous 
visit if they do not return all  medication.  
At each in -clinic visit, the subject diary will be reviewed and compared to the 
accountability  evidence  to further  ascertain  compliance  and ensure  dose times  are recorded 
for all dose administrations, including if dosing is done  in-clinic.  
Diary review may be completed remotely, if required due to a COVID -19 related reason. 
Unused packets of IMP will be returned to the investigator site at the next in -clinic visit, 
or if the situation requires, unused packets may be returned directly from the subject’s 
home to the investigator site via arranged shipment.  
At the end of the study, all unused IMP will be returned to the Sponsor’s designee or 
destroyed by the site according to the Sponsor’s instructions once it has been inventoried 
and the monitor has reviewed drug accountability records.

9.7 Treatment Blinding  Code  
An IRT will be employed in the study to manage the randomization of subjects, tracking 
and confirmation of shipments and returns, IMP supply management, inventory 
management and supply ordering, IMP expiration tracking, and emergency un -blinding  of 
the IMP.  
The IRT vendor will provide a user manual and training to each site with detailed 
instruction on the use of the IRT.  
 
 
9.8 Unblinding the Treatment  Assignment  
The treatment assignment must not be broken during the study except in emergency 
situations where the identification of the subject treatment code is required for further 
treatment of the subject. The investigator should contact the medical monitor as soon as 
possible  after the investigator  has been  unblinded  if the medical  monitor  was not contacted 
prior to unblinding of treatment  code.  
In the event that the treatment assignment is broken, the date, the signature of the person 
who broke the code, and the reason for breaking the code are recorded in the IRT and the 
source documents. Upon breaking the blind, the subject is withdrawn from the study, but 
should  be followed  up for safety  purposes.  Any code  breaks  that occur  must  be reported  to 
the CRO and  Sponsor.  
Code break IRT access is held by the investigator and pharmacist/designated person at  the 
site and by the medical monitor, or designee, for the  study.  
 
 
9.9 Permitted concomitant medication/ non - pharmacological  therapies  
All concomitant medications and non -pharmacological therapies (e.g. physiotherapy, 
occupational  therapy,  speech  therapy,  yoga)  taken  or implemented  during  the study  will be 
recorded in the CRF with indication, dose information, frequency and dates of 
administration as applicable. The Investigator should inquire at each clinic visit whether 
there have been changes in any permitted concomitant medications or non -medical 
therapies or interventions, including those in the school setting (e.g. speech  therapy).  
With regard to any permitted medication (e.g. concomitant mexiletine or stimulants) or 
therapy (e.g. occupational or physiotherapy) that the subject was taking on entry to the 
study, every effort should be made to continue at the same dose (as applicable) and 
frequency throughout the study.

posaconazole, nefazadone, indinavir, ritonavir are not permitted during this study.  
Drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 with a narrow therapeutic window e.g. warfarin and 
digitoxin, are not permitted during the study.  
Treatment with any other IMP is not permitted during this study or within 6 months prior 
to Screening.  
 
10. STUDY  SCHEDULE  
Refer  to Table  1 for a schedule  of events  where  the subject  is able to attend  the investigator 
site in  person.  
Refer to Table 2 for an adjusted schedule of events in the event that a subject is unable to 
attend the investigator site in person due to a COVID -19 related reason. If a subject is in 
quarantine due to COVID -19, home -health care visits/assessments will not be completed.  
 
 
10.1 Efficacy  Assessments  
All assessments will be performed by the investigator or appropriately delegated and 
trained personnel.  
The study will evaluate efficacy from four different perspectives (also referred to as 
efficacy domains): clinician -completed assessments, caregiver -completed assessments, 
functional  assessments  (i.e. assessments  that require  in-clinic  performance  by the enrollee), 
and biomarker/physiological  assessments.  The efficacy  domains  will include  the measures 
described  below:  
 
 
10.1.1  Clinician -Completed Assessments  
10.1.1.1  Clinician -Completed  Congenital  DM1  Rating  Scale  (CDM1 -RS) 
 
The Clinician -completed Congenital DM1 Rating Scale is an 11 -item rating scale 
completed  by the clinician  to score  the symptom  severity  of the following  domains  that are 
clinically relevant in Congenital  DM1:  If the subject is taking

• Limitations with mobility or  walking  
• Problems with hands or  arms  
• Signs of  Fatigue  
• Signs of  Pain 
• Gastrointestinal  issues  
• Communication  difficulties  
• Impaired sleep or daytime  sleepiness  
• Difficulty  thinking  
• Myotonia  
• Breathing  difficulties  
• Choking or swallowing  issues  
This list of domains is informed by the Congenital and Childhood Myotonic Dystrophy 
Health Index (CC -MDHI) (Johnson et al., 2016). The CC -MDHI is a rating scale 
developed from a Natural History Study of the symptoms and impact of Congenital DM1 
(Johnson et al., 2016). The CC -MDHI is a 168 -item Likert scale that covers multiple 
aspects of the specific phenotype of Congenital DM1, intended for completion by the 
caregiver of the subject. The CDM1 -RS is being developed in collaboration with the 
authors of the CC -MDHI. This new outcome measure utilizes domains informed by those 
reported for the CC -MDHI; the scale covers much of the breadth of the clinical  phenotype 
of Congenital  DM1.  
The severity of the clinician’s concern in each domain is scored by using a 5 point Likert 
Scale. Scores range from 0 = Not present to 4 = Very severe. The clinician is asked to  rate 
the severity  of each symptom,  using  a time frame  of the past week  including  the day of the 
assessment for  reference.  
A standard interview and examination form will be provided to the sites to assist the rater 
making  assessments  and in eliciting  commentary  from  the subject  or their caregiver  across 
each of the core domains of the affected individual’s Congenital DM1, and also on 
associated  symptoms.  Every  effort  will be made  to ensure  that the same  rater also observes 
the subject at each visit to the clinic or telehealth  visit.  
At Baseline ( ), Week ) and Week ) the CDM1 -RS will be rated twice for 
consistency evaluation purposes. One rating will be from an interview completed  in-clinic 
and an another  from  an interview  completed  via telehealth  within  the  period  before 
the in -clinic visit. Both the in -clinic and telehealth interviews will be video  recorded.

In addition to the investigator ratings of the CDM1 -RS, an independent central rater will 
also rate the CDM1 -RS for both the in-clinic  and telehealth  interviews  recorded  at Baseline 
), Week   and Week  
The CDM1 -RS will be completed  according  to the schedule  of events  and will be assessed 
via telehealth instead of an in -clinic interview if required due to a COVID -19 related 
reason.  
A copy is included in APPENDIX A: Clinician -Completed Congenital DM1 Rating Scale  
(CDM1 -RS). 
 
 
10.1.1.2  Clinical Global Impressions (Severity and  Improvement)  
The clinician administered Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI -S) and - 
Improvement  (CGI -I) scale  (Guy,  1976)  will be performed  in accordance  with the schedule 
of events. The CGI rating scale permits a global evaluation of the subject’s improvement 
over time and will be administered as detailed in the schedule of events.  
The CGI -S is a 7 -point Likert type scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of 
the subject’s illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience 
with subjects  who have  the same  diagnosis.  Considering  total clinical  experience,  a subject 
is assessed on severity of illness at the time of rating 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline 
ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely  ill. 
The CGI -I, sometimes referred to as the CGI -C, requires the clinician to rate how much 
the subject’s illness has changed (improved, worsened or stayed the same) relative to a 
baseline state (Amer Psychiatric Pub Inc, 2000). A seven point Likert type scale is used 
with ratings of 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4  
= no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, 7 = very much worse.  
The CGI-I at Baseline  ) should  be rated  against  the subject’s  clinical  presentation  at 
Run-in  ). For subsequent  CGI -I ratings  completed  from    onwards,  the 
assessment  should  be compared  against  the subject’s  clinical  presentation  at Baseline  ( .  
In this study, score levels for the CGI -S and CGI -I are calibrated to standard scoring 
anchors which are specific to the Congenital DM1 phenotype. A standard interview and 
examination form will be provided to the sites as a guide to the rater in evaluating the 
subject and in eliciting commentary from the subject or their caregiver across each of the 
core domains of the affected individual’s Congenital DM1 and also on associated 
symptoms. Every effort will be made to have the same rater also observe the subject at 
each visit to the clinic or telehealth visit.

overall quality of life in relation to the subject’s myotonic dystrophy symptoms. The CC - 
MDHI is a rating scale developed from a Natural History Study of the symptoms and 
impact of Congenital DM1 (Johnson et al., 2016). The CC -MDHI Parent Proxy is a 19 
question, 128 -item Likert scale that covers multiple aspects of the specific phenotype of 
Congenital  DM1,  intended  for completion  by the caregiver  of the subject.  Each  item offers 
6 levels of severity ranging from “he/she doesn’t experience this” to “it affects his/her life 
severely”.  
The CC -MDHI will be administered according the schedule events and will be completed 
remotely in the subject’s home if required due to a COVID -19 related reason.  
A copy of the CC -MDHI Parent Proxy can be found in APPENDIX D: Congenital and  
Childhood Myotonic Dystrophy Health Index (CC -MDHI) Parent Proxy Instrument .

10.1.2.2  Top 3 Caregiver Concerns Visual Analogue Scale  (VAS)  
The Top 3 concerns VAS allows caregivers to identify their main three causes of concern, 
related to the subject’s myotonic dystrophy, rather than these being pre -specified within a 
scale and then rating how these concerns have changed at specific time -points during the 
study.  
Caregivers will be asked to rate three causes for concern by drawing a vertical mark on a 
10 cm long VAS  with anchors  of “not at all severe”  at the left end and “very  severe”  at the 
right end. Ideally, the caregiver should choose one item that relates to muscle function 
(such as problems with walking, drinking from a straw, or grip), one item that relates to 
cognitive abilities (such as problems with thinking, planning or concentration), and one 
item that relates to performing activities of daily living (for example, problems or 
difficulties brushing teeth, getting dressed or helping with household chores). The 3 
concerns related to the subject’s myotonic dystrophy will be chosen and rated at baseline. 
These 3 signs and symptoms will be rated again according to the schedule of events using 
the same scales and will be completed remotely in the subject’s home if required due to a 
COVID -19 related  reason.  
A copy  of the Top 3 concerns  VAS  is included  in APPENDIX  E: Caregiver  Top 3 Concerns  
Visual Analog Scale  (VAS) . 
 
 
10.1.2.3  Caregiver -Completed Congenital DM1 Rating Scale (CC - CDM1 -
RS) 
This scale provides a caregiver assessment of the subject on symptoms that may occur in 
individuals with CDM1. There are a total of 11 symptoms that the caregiver is asked to 
rate: 
 
• Limitations with mobility or  walking  
• Problems with hands or  arms  
• Signs of  fatigue  
• Signs of  pain 
• Gastrointestinal  issues  
• Communication  difficulties  
• Impaired sleep or daytime  sleepiness  
• Difficulty  thinking  
• Myotonia

• Breathing  difficulties  
• Choking or swallowing  issues  
 
These  symptoms  are rated  on a score  from  0 to 4 based  on overall  severity  (e.g. severity  of 
symptoms, frequency of symptoms, context in which it occurs and functional impact), 
where  0 = Symptom  not present  or is no longer  present  during  the relevant  time frame,  and 
4 = Very severe, symptom causes pronounced and consistent impairment and is highly 
disruptive with regard to daily  life. 
When rating each symptom, the caregiver will be asked to consider how the symptom 
influences how the subject feels and how it impacts his/her ability to perform everyday 
functions. Caregivers ratings should also incorporate important observations that they 
make of the subject, with regard to his/her symptoms. For example, caregivers should 
consider the subject's behaviors and verbalizations (what he/she says), as well as the 
symptoms that the caregiver can actually see. When making their ratings, the caregiver is 
asked to consider a time frame of the past week including the day of the assessment for 
reference.  
The CC -CDM1 -RS will be administered according to the schedule of events and will be 
completed remotely in the subject’s home if required due to a COVID -19 related reason.  
A copy of the CC -CDM1 -RS is included in APPENDIX F: Caregiver Completed  
Congenital DM1 Rating Scale (CC -CDM1 -RS). 
 
10.1.2.4  Caregiver Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1  Status  
Study staff will ask the caregiver for some optional basic information about themselves 
which will be recorded in the CRF. The information includes:  
• Relationship of the caregiver to the subject (e.g. mother, father, sibling,  other)  
• If the caregiver has a diagnosis of  DM1  
• Which subtype of DM1 the caregiver has, if  applicable  
 
 
10.1.3  Functional  Assessments  
10.1.3.1  10-Meter walk -run test (preferred speed and fastest speed)  
The 10 -meter walk/run test is a performance measure used to assess walking speed in 
meters per second over a short distance. It can be used as an assessment of functional 
mobility. The test will be conducted according to the schedule of events and will be 
performed at the subject’s preferred walking speed and then at the fastest speed possible.

For each speed, the test should be repeated until 3 valid measures are obtained. No more 
than 6 trials per speed should be conducted, with 10 -15 seconds of rest between trials to 
avoid fatigue. If needed, the rest period can be longer, until the subject has recovered.  
The subject  walks  without  assistance  for 12 meters  while  the time taken  to walk  from  meter 
1 to meter 11 is recorded. The electronic timing system starts and stops when the subject 
crosses  the 1 and 11-meter  line, respectively.  Assistive  devices  such as orthotics/splints  are 
allowed, forearm crutches or walkers are not allowed. Use of assistive devices must be 
documented and kept consistent for that subject throughout the  study.  
For the fastest speed possible, the assessor will document whether the subject was able to 
run, walk fast or walk for each assessment. Whether the subject is running is defined as 
both feet being off the floor at the same time. If the subject is not able/willing to perform 
the fastest speed possible for all 3 valid assessments, this will also be recorded.  
The 10-meter  walk/run  will not be collected  remotely  (i.e. if an in-clinic  visit is not possible 
due to a COVID -19 related reason) as it is unable to be completed safely in a home 
environment.  
 
 
10.1.3.2  Quantitative myometric measure of hand grip  strength  
Handgrip myometry is used as a measure of myotonia and muscle strength and has been 
validated as a reliable measure in patients with DM1 (Moxley et al., 2007).  
The force of concentration will be measured using the Jamar Handgrip Dynamometer and 
will be measured in kilograms (Kg).  
Handgrip strength will be tested bilaterally, first on the right and then followed by the left 
hand. The subject will be asked to squeeze the Jamar Handgrip dynamometer for 3 -5 
seconds  to allow  for maximal  muscle  contraction,  after which  the subject  will release  their 
grip and relax their hand. This will be repeated until 3 valid measures are obtained. A 
maximal  6 trials  per hand  will be attempted,  with a 5 to 10 second  rest given  between  trials 
to avoid  fatigue.  
Handgrip  strength  will not be collected  remotely  (i.e. if an in-clinic  visit is not possible  due 
to a COVID -19 related reason) as specialized physiotherapists are unavailable for home 
healthcare  visits . 
 
 
10.1.3.3  Measurement of lip strength via lip force  meter  
Lip strength will be measured using a mouthguard adaptation for the digital force meter. 
Subject s will insert the mouthguard between their incisors and their lips and hold as  force 
is applied  for 10 seconds  with increasing  force  until the mouthguard  is dropped.

10.1.3.4  NIH  Toolbox Cognition Battery: Dimensional Change Card Sort 
Test 
The NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery: Dimensional Change Card Sort Test (DCCS) is a 
measure of cognitive flexibility and attention in individuals aged 3 years and older. Two 
target pictures are presented that vary along two dimensions (e.g., shape and color). 
Subjects are asked to match a series of bivalent test pictures (e.g., yellow balls and blue 
trucks) to the target pictures, first according to one dimension (e.g., color) and then, after 
a number of trials, according to the other dimension (e.g., shape). The relevant dimension 
for sorting is indicated by a cue word (e.g., “shape” or “color”) that appears on the screen 
for all subjects  and that, for young  children  ages 3-11 years,  is also spoken  by a prerecorded 
audio  file. 
The NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery: Dimensional Change Card Sort Test is unable to be 
collected remotely as telehealth administration is non -standard administration and may 
alter the integrity of the data collected. Sensitivity analyses on the primary, key secondary 
and one secondary endpoint to support telehealth administration are intended to be 
performed, therefore additional sensitivity analyses for this exploratory test will not be 
performed.  
 
 
10.1.3.5  NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery: Picture Sequence Memory  Test 
The NIH Toolbox  Cognition  Battery:  Picture  Sequence  Memory  Test (PSMT)  is a measure 
developed  for the assessment  of episodic  memory  for ages 3-85 years.  It involves  recalling 
increasingly lengthy series of illustrated objects and activities that are presented in a 
particular order on the iPad screen, with corresponding audio -recorded phrases. The 
sequence of pictures appears one at a time in the center of the computer screen in a fixed 
order. As each picture appears, a recording briefly describes its content. This continues 
until all pictures in a sequence have been displayed and placed in their proper positions. 
Once  all the pictures  in the sequence  are displayed,  the pictures  then are placed  in a random 
spatial array at the center of the screen. The subjects are asked to recall the sequence of 
pictures demonstrated over two learning trials; sequence length varies from 6 -18 pictures,

10.1.3.6  Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test  (PPVT)  
The PPVT –4 scale is a norm -referenced instrument for measuring the receptive (hearing) 
vocabulary of children and adults. It contains training items and 228 test items, each 
consisting of four full -color pictures as response options on a page. For each item, the 
examiner says a word, and the examinee responds by selecting the picture that best 
illustrates that word’s meaning.  
Each administration of the test produces a raw score as well as a standard score, derived 
from the number of responses attempted and the number of correct responses. The  percent 
of correct responses is also  reported.  
The PPVT will be performed according to the schedule of events.  
The PPVT is unable to be collected remotely as telehealth administration is non -standard 
administration and telehealth administration is not included in the normative group. 
Sensitivity analyses on the primary, key secondary and one secondary endpoint to support 
telehealth administration are intended to be performed, therefore additional sensitivity 
analyses for this exploratory test will not be performed.  
 
 
10.1.4  Biomarker/Physiological  Assessments  
10.1.4.1  Dual -energy X -ray absorptiometry (DXA) whole body scan of lean 
muscle mass  
DXA (previously DEXA) utilizes two low energy X -ray beams, with different energy 
levels, which are aimed at the subject’s bones. The DXA scan measures bone mineral 
density,  lean muscle  mass,  fat content,  and total body  composition.  The amount  of radiation 
used in a DXA scan is very  low. 
The primary assessment of interest in this study, from an efficacy perspective, is lean 
muscle  mass.  Subjects  will have  their lean muscle  mass  determined  by a whole  body  DXA 
scan and the following  parameters  recorded  in grams;  arms,  legs and total.  Bone  mineral

• Any surgical procedures that have occurred during 1 year before the Screening Visit 
( ) and any history of having an implanted cardiac  pacemaker  
• History of use of mechanical ventilation, gastronomy tube or cough assist  devices  
 
10.2.2  Physical  Examination  
A full physical examination will be conducted. This will be completed by a delegated 
physician.  
A full physical examination is composed of a review of the following body systems:  
• General  appearance  
• Skin 
• Head, eyes, ears, nose and  throat  
• Respiratory  
• Cardiovascular  
• Abdomen (including liver and  kidneys)  
• Musculoskeletal  
• Neurological  
Any abnormalities  that are identified  at the Screening  Visit  ( )  will be documented  in the 
subject’s source and on the medical/surgical history CRF page. Any changes occurring 
after the Screening Visit will be captured as AEs on the AE CRF page, as determined by 
the Investigator.  
If an improvement/resolution of a physical examination finding documented in the 
subject’s medical history occurs during the study, it should be recorded in the source 
document. If there is resolution of a physical examination finding previously noted as an 
AE, then the event resolution and stop date should be recorded on the AE CRF page.  
Physical examinations will not be completed if an in -clinic visit is not feasible due to a 
COVID -19 related reason. If a subject is unable to attend Week  as an in -clinic 
visit, a physical examination will be obtained locally by a physician.  
 
 
10.2.3  Height  
A calibrated stadiometer should be used to measure height. Height should be measured  in 
centimetres without shoes with the subject standing on a flat surface and with their chin 
parallel  to the floor.  The body  should  be straight  but not rigid.  The subject’s  height  should 
be recorded to the nearest  0.5cm.

Height will be collected remotely in the subject’s home using an AMO approved home 
healthcare vendor, if required due to a COVID -19 related reason.  
 
 
10.2.4  Weight  
The same  calibrated  scale  should  be used for all weight  measurements  for a subject.  Weight 
should be measured in kilograms without shoes and recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg. Bulky 
items  should  be removed  whenever  possible  to ensure  the most  accurate  weight  is recorded. 
All orthotics should be removed prior to weight  measurement.  
Weight will be collected remotely in the subject’s home using an AMO approved home 
healthcare vendor, if required due to a COVID -19 related reason.  
 
 
10.2.5  Adverse Event  collection  
Subjects will be questioned in a non -leading way to determine if AEs have occurred since 
the last visit e.g. “Have  you had any health  problems  since  your last visit?”  AEs and SAEs 
will be collected from the time of informed  consent.  
At Week   or Week  , a member  of the study  team  should  telephone  the subject 
and/or caregiver to assess if there have been any AEs and collect any new or changed 
medications. This should be assessed again at the next in -clinic appointment to ensure 
accurate collection of  information.  
Adverse events will be elicited at  hours ) and  hours ( ) post the end of 
treatment visit (  via telephone by a member of the study team.  
Standard (i.e. non -leading) questions should be used but the clinician should bear in mind 
that the purpose of AE questioning is to elicit events specifically related to study drug 
dependency,  abuse  or withdrawal.  However,  all reported  adverse  events  should  be reported 
in the  eCRF.  
Adverse  events  will be collected  by telehealth  or telephone  if required  due to a COVID -19 
related  reason.  
Refer to sec tion 10.5 for additional details of AE collection and reporting.  
 
 
10.2.6  Vital signs  
Vital signs will include the following measures: temperature, pulse, systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure and respiratory rate. Blood pressure and pulse will be determined after the 
subject has been in the sitting position for 5 minutes.

Blood pressure should be determined by cuff (using the same method, the same arm, and 
in the same position throughout the study). A BP cuff appropriate for the subject’s arm 
length  and girth  should  be used for all BP measurements.  The cuff should  be approximately 
two-thirds  the length/width  of the subject’s  arm (from  elbow  to shoulder).  The cuff should 
be calibrated and ideally the same cuff should be used on a subject throughout the study. 
All BP measurements should be performed by the same study site personnel (if possible) 
throughout the  study.  
Any vital signs which in the opinion of the investigator are deemed to be clinically 
significant are to be recorded as an AE. Any clinically significant abnormalities at the 
follow -up visit should be followed up and repeated until they have returned to baseline or 
are, in the opinion of the investigator, no longer clinically significant.  
Vital  signs  will be collected  remotely  in the subject’s  home  using  an AMO  approved  home 
healthcare vendor, if required due to a COVID -19 related  reason.  
 
 
10.2.7  Clinical Laboratory  Evaluations  
All clinical  laboratory  assays  will be performed  according  to the study  laboratory’s  normal 
procedures. Reference ranges will be supplied by the study laboratory and will be used to 
assess the laboratory data for clinical significance and out of range  changes.  
Safety laboratory and urinalysis samples will be collected remotely in the subject’s home 
using an AMO approved home healthcare vendor for unscheduled visits as required or if 
required due to a COVID -19 related reason.  
 
 
Biochemistry  
A biochemistry  sample  will be collected  as outlined  in the schedule  of events.  Biochemistry 
blood samples can be drawn with the subject in either a fasting or non -fasting state. 
However, if a sample needs to be repeated, the subsequent sample should be drawn from 
the subject in the same fasting/non -fasting  state.  
At the Screening   a virology  panel  (may  be collected  separately  from  the biochemistry 
sample in some regions) will analysed to determine if there is serological evidence of 
Hepatitis A at or in the past  or an active Hepatitis B or C infection 
(Anti -HAV IgM, anti -HBc IgM, Hep B surface antigen, HCV). If an initial positive  result

cannot  be estimated  using  the study  data only,  prior  information  on parameter  distributions 
from a previously reported pharmacokinetic model of tideglusib will be used. In order to 
determine whether there are associations between pharmacokinetic parameters and 
efficacy measures, change from baseline in efficacy measures over the course of the  study 
may be correlated with model -predicted PK parameters estimated for each subject. These 
associations may be statistically tested using correlation coefficients and general linear

10.5 Adverse  Events  
Adverse  events  may be volunteered  spontaneously  by the subject,  or discovered  as a result 
of general,  non-leading  questioning.  All adverse  events  should  be recorded  in the CRF and 
source  document.  
 
10.5.1  Definitions 
Adverse Event  (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject administered a 
medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.  
Abnormal laboratory findings should be reviewed by a delegated physician to determine 
whether they are clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratories should 
be reported as an AE. Where possible an underlying diagnosis should be reported as the 
AE. 
 
Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)  
All events considered to be untoward and unintended responses to a medicinal product 
related  to any dose should  be considered  adverse  drug reactions.  The definition  covers  also 
medication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, including misuse and 
abuse of the product. The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable 
possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled  out. 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An adverse event that at any  dose:

• Is life -threatening (i.e. the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does 
not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more 
severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  (see 
explanation  below)  
• Results in persistent or significant  disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
• Is considered to be an important medical event  
 
Based upon medical and scientific judgment, important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening, or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the 
subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above may be considered a serious adverse event.  
Hospitalizations are defined as initial or prolonged admissions that include an overnight 
stay. Hospitalization  or prolonged  hospitalization  for technical,  practical  or social  reasons, 
in the absence of an adverse event is not an  SAE.  
 
Pregnancy  
Pregnancy itself is not considered an AE. However, any pregnancy complication, 
spontaneous or elective abortion (for medical reasons), still birth, neonatal death, or 
congenital anomaly will be recorded in both the clinical and safety database.  
If the investigator  becomes  aware  of a pregnancy  in a female  subject,  or in a female  partner 
of a male subject in this study, every effort will be made to follow the pregnancy until 
termination or  delivery.  
In the event of pregnancy (either in a female subject or a female partner of a male subject 
in the study), it will be reported on a pregnancy form, and reported as per the information 
in section 10.5.8.  This report will be followed up to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, and the presence or absence of any 
birth defects or congenital abnormalities. The outcome will be documented in the CRF if 
feasible. In the case of a female subject, the subject must be withdrawn from the study.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with applicable 
product information (e.g., Investigators Brochure for an unapproved IMP).  
 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR)

Protocol Number: 
AMO -02-MD-2-003 Version 9.0 FINAL  
02 FEB 2023  Page 106 of 161   
  
A serious AE that is suspected to be related to the administered medicinal product and the 
nature or severity of which is not consistent with applicable product information.  
Reports which add significant information on the specificity, increase of occurrence, or 
severity of a known, already documented serious adverse reaction constitute unexpected 
events.  
 
 
10.5.2  Severity  Categorization  
The severity (intensity) of each AE will be classified as:  
• Mild  (Grade  1) Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated; no 
interference with activity  
• Moderate  (Grade  2) Sign or symptom causes discomfort, some interference with 
activity  
• Severe  (Grade 3)  Sign or symptom of sufficient intensity to prevent  activity  
• Potentially Life Threatening  (Grade  4) Requires  emergent  care or 
hospitalization  
Examples of gradation for AEs can be found in the FDA Guidance for Industry “Toxicity 
Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive 
Vaccine Clinical Trials” (FDA, 2005).  
A change in severity should be captured as a new AE.  
 
 
10.5.3  Assessment of  Causality  
 
A study physician must assess the relationship to the IMP for each AE. The likely 
relationship of each AE to the IMP will be assessed according to the definitions below:  
• Unrelated  
• Related  
 
10.5.4  Outcome  Categorization  
All AEs should have an outcome recorded, which should be updated if it changes during 
the reporting and follow -up period (defined in section 10.5.9 ). The possible outcomes 
should be:  
• Fatal  
• Recovered/Resolved

02 FEB 2023  Page 107 of 161   
  
• Recovering/Resolving  
• Recovered/Resolved with sequalae  
• Not recovered/not  resolved  
For fatal outcomes, every effort should be made to ensure source documentation (e.g. 
autopsy report, death certificate) to confirm the cause of death will be available to be 
reviewed by the independent DSMC.  
 
 
10.5.5  Symptoms of Disease Under  Study  
Symptoms of the disease under study (e.g. problems with ambulation, fine motor 
difficulties, fatigue, speech difficulties, and gastrointestinal issues) present before study 
entry should be recorded in the CRF. These symptoms should not be classed as AEs as 
long as changes are within the normal day to day fluctuation or expected progression of 
the disease; however, significant worsening of the symptoms, in the opinion of the 
investigator, should be recorded as an AE.  
 
 
10.5.6  Clinical Laboratory  Evaluations  
Abnormal  laboratory  findings  (e.g. ) or 
other abnormal assessments (e.g. ECGs, vital signs) that are judged by the Investigator as 
clinically  significant  will be recorded  as AEs or SAEs  if they meet  the definition  of an AE, 
as defined in Section 10.5.1 . 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that  are 
detected during the study and significantly worsen following the start of the study will be 
reported as AEs or SAEs.  
The Investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically 
significant.  
Subjects with any TEAE laboratory abnormality ( ) will be 
followed up until recovery or stabilization of the condition.  
 
 
10.5.7  Abuse, Misuse, Overdose or Medication  Error  
Subjects should not exceed the maximum daily doses or take any two doses within an 8 - 
hour interval. There is no specific antidote to tideglusib. In the event of an overdose, 
appropriate supportive measures should be employed as clinically indicated and the 
Medical Monitor must be informed immediately. The investigator should determine

appropriate  supportive  assessments  which  may include  a thorough  assessment  for potential 
hepatotoxicity,  including  assessment  of serum  chemistries,  with particular  attention  to ALT 
and bilirubin levels, after the cessation of drug. Repeat examinations should be conducted 
as clinically  indicated.  
 
 
10.5.8  Serious Adverse Event  Reporting  
Once  an Investigator  or delegate  becomes  aware  that an SAE  or pregnancy  has occurred  in 
a study  subject,  she/he  will report  the information  to the Sponsor’s  appointed  agent  within 
24 hours  of awareness  by completing  the SAE  or Pregnancy  form  and e-mailing  (or faxing 
if e-mail is not possible) this and any available supporting documentation to the details 
below:  
 
Pharmacovigilance 
(PV) Provider:  
 
SAE email contact:  
 
SAE Fax number:  
 
 
SAE Telephone 
contact:  
 
 
 
 
The SAE/Pregnancy form will always be completed as thoroughly as possible with all 
available details of the event, and signed by the Investigator (or authorized designee). If 
the Investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE or Pregnancy, he/she  will 
not wait to receive additional information before notifying the PV Provider / Medical 
Monitor of the event and completing the form. The form will be updated when additional 
information is  received.  
The Investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial 
report as described in Section 10.5.3  of this protocol.

The PV provider will contact the Investigator should it be necessary to clarify any of the 
event information. The Investigator should provide follow -up information for the event to 
the PV provider as soon as it becomes available.  
Any event  that in the opinion  of the Principal  Investigator  may be of immediate  or potential 
concern  for the subject’s  health  or well-being  will be reported  to the Medical  Monitor  with 
parallel notification to the PV  Provider.  
SAEs that are ongoing at the Week follow -up visit (  will be followed until 
resolution or stabilization of subject condition, whichever occurs first. In such cases, 
follow -up SAE forms will be completed at the Week  follow -up visit  and on 
resolution or stabilisation, whichever occurs first.  
SAEs  occurring  to a subject  after the subject  has completed  the clinical  trial and for which 
a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship is assessed by the investigator, should be 
reported by the investigator to the Sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them 
regardless of the time that has elapsed (post -trial events).  
All SAE and AE data will be reviewed by the independent DSMC at scheduled meetings.  
AMO Pharma Ltd is required to expedite to worldwide regulatory authorities, reports of 
Serious  Adverse  Events,  Serious  Adverse  Drug  reactions  or Suspected  Unexpected  Serious 
Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) in line with the relevant legislation of the applicable 
Regulatory  Authorities.  
All investigators will receive a safety letter notifying them of relevant SUSAR reports. In 
accordance with 21 CFR 312.32 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations, the 
European Commission Directive 2001/20/EC, and C.05.014 of the Canadian Food and 
Drug Regulations, AMO Pharma Ltd or delegate will notify the relevant Institutional 
Review Board, Ethics Committees, and Research Ethics Board in concerned Regulatory 
Authorities of applicable SUSARs as individual notifications or through a periodic line 
listing.  
AMO Pharma Ltd or delegate will submit to the Regulatory Authorities all safety updates 
and periodic reports, as required by applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
 
10.5.9  Time Period, Frequency, and Method of Detecting AEs and  SAEs  
Any pre-existing  conditions  or signs  and/or  symptoms  present  in a subject  prior  to the start 
of the study (i.e., before on -study informed consent is obtained) that do not result in the 
exclusion of the subject from participating in the study, should be recorded as 
Medical/Surgical  History.

All SAE’s and AEs occurring after informed consent and on or before the final visit must 
be reported. All AEs must be recorded irrespective of whether they are considered drug 
related.  
At each visit/assessment in the period defined above, AEs will be evaluated by the 
Investigator and recorded.  
Any AEs already documented at a previous assessment and designated as ongoing,  should 
be reviewed at subsequent visits. If these have resolved, this should be  documented.  
 
 
11. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
The details of all planned analyses will be specified in a separate statistical analysis plan 
(SAP) which will be finalized prior to hard -lock of the study database. The SAP will 
contain  details  of all the analyses  including  specifications  for all tables,  listings  and figures. 
All statistical programming will be performed using SAS  software.  
A blinded  sample  size re-estimation  (SSRE),  based  on the observed  variance  in the primary 
outcome measure, will occur when approximately 33% of subjects are enrolled and have 
completed   The variability  of key secondary  and secondary  endpoints  may 
be assessed as well, if feasible. This SSRE was executed as planned.  
Primary  and key secondary  analyses  of efficacy  will be based  on the Intent  To Treat  (ITT) 
population and the summary of safety based upon the Safety Analysis Set (see definitions 
below in sec tion 11.2 ). Other efficacy analyses will be based on the Full Analysis  Set. 
Statistical significance will be assessed at the 0.05 two -sided level, unless specified 
otherwise.  
In general, statistical analyses will be performed using methods which account for known 
potential confounding data (e.g. sites/geographic locations, baseline characteristics, 
 
Changes in efficacy variables from Baseline  to post -treatment visits (or observed 
values for some variables such as CGI -I) will be summarized and compared between the 
weight adjusted tideglusib 1000 mg dose and placebo at each study visit. The primary 
comparison will be performed for changes from baseline to end of treatment. The model 
details and data displays will be described in the SAP.  
Additionally, the changes from baseline over time will be compared using linear mixed 
effects repeated measures modelling.  
For all analyses,  the effects  of the weight  adjusted  tideglusib  1000  mg dose versus  placebo 
will be estimated at the end of treatment and presented along with associated 95% two - 
sided confidence intervals and p -values. The comparisons may also be performed at  other

time points; however the p -values should be reviewed with caution due to potential 
multiplicity issue (high probability of chance -alone outcomes).  
Subjects  and who discontinue 
the study will be classified as screening failures. Subjects  
 but who discontinue the study before taking a dose of tideglusib will be classified 
as run -in failures.  
 
 
11.1 Estimated Sample  Size 
 
One of the study goals is to identify consistent efficacy trends in the primary and key 
secondary endpoints. Twenty -five subjects per group will generate 70% power to detect 
the effect size of 0.6 at the 0.1 two -sided significance level. This sample size will also be 
sufficient to generate 80% power to detect the effect size of 0.82 at the 0.05 two -sided 
significance level. Accounting for a 10% -13% drop -out rate, approximately 28 subjects 
per group  were  initially  planned.  No data are available  on the CDM1 -RS instrument.  Based 
on the preliminary  data observed  in the AMO -02-MD-2-001 study,  the assumed  effect  sizes 
look reasonable.  The effect  size assumptions  are partially  based  on the Clinician  VAS  total 
score changes from baseline to end of study (6 points on drug vs. 1 point on placebo with 
the common standard deviation of 5.8). Based on these and other data, 29 and 22 subjects 
per group will be sufficient to generate 90% and 80% power at the 0.05 two -sided 
significance level. Based on these calculations, the suggested sample size of 56 patients 
total was considered adequate to detect the treatment effect or at least a consistent  trend.  
A blinded SSRE, based on the observed variance in the primary outcome measure, was 
performed during the conduct of the study. Based on the blinded SSRE, the planned 
sample size is sufficient to detect the treatment difference between active and control 
arms based on the primary endpoint with at least 80% power at the 0.05 two sided 
significance level. However, the variability of the key secondary endpoint was slightly 
greater than that originally assumed. Respectively, it was recommended, if operationally 
feasible, to increase the total sample size to a maximum of 66 subjects.  
However, based on the blinded SSRE, the pooled standard deviation of change from 
baseline for the primary endpoint was 2.64. Assuming this standard deviation and as long 
as the difference  in the primary  endpoint  mean  change  from  baseline  to EOT  between  drug 
and control is at least 2.2, the power to detect treatment differences will be 82% if 
n=25/group.  
 
 
The details of the SSRE and summary of scenarios and outcomes are outlined in the SAP.

11.2 Study  Populations  
 
Assignment of subjects to analysis populations will be agreed prior to database lock and 
unblinding.  
 
The Intent  to Treat  Set (ITT)  will include  all randomized  subjects.  Subjects  will be included 
in the analysis  set according  to their randomized  treatment  assignment  regardless  of actual 
treatment received. The ITT is the primary population for the analysis of efficacy  data.  
 
The Safety Analysis Set (SAF) will include all randomised subjects who took at least one 
dose of IMP. The SAF will be used for all summaries of safety data.  
 
The Full Analysis  Set (FAS)  will include  all randomised  subjects  in the SAF for whom  any 
efficacy data were collected post randomisation. Subjects will be included in the analysis 
set according to the treatment they actually  received.  
 
The Per Protocol  Set (PPS)  will include  all subjects  in the FAS who did not have  any major 
protocol violations. Definitions of major and minor protocol violations will be included  in 
the SAP prior to data lock and unblinding. Subjects excluded from the PPS will be 
determined  prior  to data unblinding.  If no subjects  are excluded  from  the PPS,  the PPS will 
not be required. The PPS will be used for secondary analyses of efficacy  data.  
 
The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PKAS) will consist of all subjects for whom PK 
samples that were taken were analyzable and for whom the corresponding dosing 
information prior to sample collection and sample collection information is available. 
Listings of study data will be based on all subjects who were randomised into the study.  
 
 
11.3 Demographic and Baseline  Characteristics  
Summaries of demographic and baseline characteristics (including medical history, 
Congenital  DM1  history,  prior  treatments)  will be provided  by treatment  group  and overall 
for the  SAF.  
 
 
11.4 Statistical Methods for  Safety  
All safety summaries and analyses will be performed using the SAF.  
All AEs will be coded  using  the MedDRA  dictionary  and will be summarized  by treatment 
using frequencies and percentages as  appropriate.

Other safety  data, including laboratory, vital signs and ECG values including change from 
baseline will be summarized. Changes in safety parameters from Baseline (  over time 
will be described by treatment dose, and shift tables at time points of interest will be 
generated. Changes from the start of the  run-in period ) to 
Baseline ) will also be produced as indicative of the effect of two weeks of  
 
 
 
11.5 Statistical Methods for  Efficacy  
Primary analysis of efficacy will be based on the ITT population. Additional analysis will 
be performed based on FAS.  
The primary efficacy endpoint (CDM1 -RS) will be calculated at each time point as a total 
score  based  on 11 domain  ratings.  Changes  in efficacy  variables  from  the start of the  
 run-in to Baseline for each subject will be summarized and will 
be considered as indicative of the effect of two weeks of . Changes  from 
Baseline  to post -treatment visits will be summarized by treatment group (weight 
adjusted  tideglusib  1000  mg versus  Placebo)  at each study  visit.  For the CGI-I the observed 
values will be  summarized.  
Change  from  baseline  to end of treatment  will be analysed  using  general  linear  model  with 
terms for treatment group, baseline and treatment group by baseline interaction (observed 
values  will be analysed  for the CGI-I).  
 
The statistical significance of changes from baseline over time may also be assessed  using 
the linear mixed effects repeated measures model with fixed effect terms for treatment 
group, follow -up visit and treatment group by follow -up visit interaction. Subject will be 
included as a random effect and baseline as a covariate.  
 If covariates/interactions in any model are 
not statistically significant at the 0.05/0.1 two -sided levels, respectively, they will be 
excluded from the model. The details will be specified in the  SAP.  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint for analysis is:  
• CGI-I at the end of  treatment  
 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for analysis are:  
• The change from baseline in the Top 3 Caregiver Concerns VAS total score to end of 
treatment  
• The change from baseline in the CC -CDM1 -RS total score to end of  treatment

• The change from baseline in CGI -S to end of  treatment  
• The change from baseline in the CDM1 -RS independent central rater total score  to end 
of treatment  
• The change from baseline in CGI -S independent central rater score to end of  treatment  
• CGI-I independent central rater score at the end of  treatment  
• The change  from  baseline  in 10 Meter  Walk/Run  (preferred  speed  and fastest  speed)  to 
end of  treatment  
 
Due to COVID -19 related restrictions some of the data at certain visits may be collected 
using a telehealth approach while other data may be collected during in -clinic visits. To 
evaluate the consistency of telehealth data and in -clinic data for the CDM1 -RS and CGI 
rating  scales  and to minimize  the potential  bias, Baseline  ), Week  ( )  and Week   
) visits will be performed using both in -clinic and telehealth data collection 
approaches. The following analysis will be performed to evaluate the consistency of these 
two methods of data collection. The details of these and some other consistency analyses 
will be specified in the  SAP.  
• Telehealth data will be plotted against corresponding in -clinic data for visual 
evaluation; the changes from baseline to various time points based on the 
corresponding telehealth and in -clinic data will also be  plotted.  
• The various descriptive statistics for the difference between corresponding telehealth 
and in -clinic data will be evaluated; the changes from baseline for the corresponding 
telehealth and in -clinic data will be evaluated using various descriptive statistics and 
correlation  analysis.  
According to the recommendations in the FDA Guidance “Statistical Considerations for 
Clinical Trials During the COVID -19 Public Health Emergency” the following sensitivity 
analyses will be performed in addition to the primary analysis performed (FDA,  2020).  
• If the data is missing due to a subject’s inability to attend clinic due to COVID -19 
related reasons, the corresponding telehealth data will be utilized, where applicable; 
the primary and key secondary analyses will then be  performed.  
• If the dataset includes both in -clinic and telehealth data, the analysis stratified by the 
data acquisition method will be performed. Alternatively, the indicator variable with 
the values corresponding to the data acquisition approaches may be utilized in the 
model to determine the significance of the data acquisition impact on  outcomes.  
• The missing data will be imputed using one of the imputation approaches described 
below and primary and key secondary analyses will be  performed.  
The details of the sensitivity analyses will be described in the SAP.

As a supporting analysis, should the primary endpoint be met, the primary, key secondary 
and secondary endpoints may be evaluated using the permutation test (Berry -Kravis et al., 
2020  (accepted);  Glaze  et al., 2017;  Jessup  et al., 2011)  based  on the additional  criteria  for 
“success” specified in the SAP (for example, 3 secondary endpoints, including the key 
secondary, demonstrate numerical superiority of drug to placebo with the remaining 
secondary endpoints demonstrating non -inferiority of drug to placebo based on the pre - 
specified threshold). Full details of the resampling procedure will be included in the 
Statistical Analysis  Plan.  
The exploratory endpoint analysis will be outlined in the SAP. The details of the analysis 
methods will be determined after exploratory endpoint data review.  
The following exploratory endpoints, the NIH toolbox assessments (i.e. Dimensional 
Change Card Sort Test and Picture Sequence Memory Test) and the Peabody Picture 
Vocabulary Test (PPVT) will not be completed by telehealth in the event that a subject 
cannot  attend  clinic  due to a COVID -19 related  reason,  as telehealth  administration  is non- 
standard administration for these tests. As described above, sensitivity analyses will be 
performed on the primary, the key secondary and one secondary endpoint to support 
telehealth administration, but additional sensitivity analyses for these exploratory 
endpoints are not  planned.  
A subject -level (scorecard) analysis will be performed based on the composite of primary 
and secondary endpoints (details will be provided in the SAP).  
11.6 Missing data  
In the analysis  of the primary,  key secondary,  and secondary  endpoints,  sensitivity  analyses 
will be performed to examine the potential influence of missing data. Depending on the 
actual data patterns, various imputation methodologies may be employed. Multiple 
imputation methodology may be used with missing data imputed by randomized arm 
according to the within arm distribution of the observed, non -missing data. Alternatively, 
the mean value within treatment group at a given time point may be imputed. Full details 
of the approach to examine the influence of missing data will be included in the  Statistical 
Analysis Plan. The missing data will not be imputed for mixed effects models. No 
imputations will be performed for per protocol  analysis.  
If in-clinic data are missing due to a subject’s inability to attend clinic due to COVID -19 
related reasons, the corresponding telehealth data can be utilized instead. If both in -clinic 
and telehealth data are missing, the imputations described above may be utilized.

Individual pharmacokinetic data will be tabulated and concentration vs. time curves 
presented by treatment dose. Derived parameters will be summarized by dose group. 
Detailed information will be outlined in the pharmacokinetic analysis plan.  
 
 
12. END OF THE  STUDY  
The end of the study is defined as the last subject’s last study assessment, which for this 
protocol is the final follow -up visit conducted post-treatment for those subjects 
not proceeding into the extension protocol AMO -02-MD-2-004, or the final study 
assessment for subjects who do proceed into the extension protocol.

Committee (EC)/Research Ethics Board (REB), the protocol cannot be amended without 
approval by AMO Pharma Ltd. Unless a substantial amendment needs to be  implemented 
urgently in the interests of safety, substantial amendments to the protocol must be 
authorized by the Regulatory Authority and IRB/EC prior to  implementation.  
 
 
14.2 Monitoring  
The investigator and institution will permit study -related monitoring, providing direct 
access to source data/documents.  
 
 
14.3 Quality  Assurance  
To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, the 
investigator and institution will permit study -related audits, IRB/IEC review, and 
regulatory inspections, providing direct access to source data/documents.  
 
 
14.4 Data  Recording  
14.4.1  Data to be Considered as Source Data  
Source  data is defined  as the first place  that data is documented.  Source  data must  meet  the 
following “ALCOAC”  principles:  
• Attributable  
• Legible  
• Contemporaneous  
• Original  
Investigational Medicinal

Protocol Number: 
AMO -02-MD-2-003 Version 9.0 FINAL  
02 FEB 2023  Page 118 of 161   
  
• Accurate  
• Complete  
For this study,  source  data can include,  but is not limited  to, medical  records,  study  specific 
source sheets (as applicable), laboratory reports, laboratory sample collection forms,  ECG 
traces, clinician correspondence, subject, caregiver and clinician completed tests, scales 
and questionnaires. Source data can be recorded electronically or on paper. Electronic 
records must be in a validated system that allows ALCOAC principles to  apply.  
 
 
14.5 CRF  
An electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) will be used to capture subject data. Access to 
enter data in the eCRF will be limited to delegated and trained investigator site staff only.  
Data in the eCRF will be verified by monitors according to a risk -appropriate monitoring 
strategy.  
 
 
14.6 Confidentiality  
The Investigator  must  assure  that the subject’s  anonymity  will be maintained.  On all study 
documentation, with the exception of the consent form and subject ID logs, subjects will 
only be identified by their unique identification code and will not be referred to by  name.  
The Sponsor may transfer some data collected during the study to a different company or 
regulatory authority within/outside Europe for the purpose of processing, review, analysis 
or storage. Whenever the subject’s personal data is transferred, it will be kept confidential 
and secure, and will be used only for the purpose for which it was collected.  
 
 
14.7 Retention of Study Data  
Following  closure  of the study,  the Investigator  must  maintain  all site study  records,  except 
for those required by local regulations to be maintained by someone else, in a safe and 
secure location. The records must be maintained to allow easy and timely retrieval, when 
needed (e.g., audit or inspection), and, whenever feasible, to allow any subsequent review 
of data in conjunction  with assessment  of the facility,  supporting  systems,  and staff.  Where 
permitted  by local  laws/  regulations  or institutional  policy,  some  or all of these  records  can 
be maintained in a format other than hard copy (e.g., microfiche, scanned, electronic); 
however, caution needs to be exercised before such action is taken. The Investigator must 
assure that all reproductions are legible and are a true and accurate copy of the originals, 
and meet  accessibility  and retrieval  standards,  including  re-generating  a hard copy,  if

required.  Furthermore,  the Investigator  must  ensure  there  is an acceptable  back -up of these 
reproductions and that an acceptable quality control process exists for making these 
reproductions.  
AMO Pharma Ltd. will inform the Investigator of the time period for retaining these 
records to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements. The minimum retention 
time will meet the strictest standard applicable to that site for the study, as dictated by  any 
institutional requirements or local laws or regulations, or AMO Pharma Ltd. or delegated 
CRO’s SOPs; otherwise, the retention period will default to 25 years.  
The Investigator must notify AMO Pharma Ltd. of any changes in the archival 
arrangements, including, but not limited to, archival at an off -site facility or transfer of 
ownership  of the records  in the event  the Investigator  leaves  the site. The Investigator  may 
not dispose of any records without prior approval from AMO Pharma  Ltd. 
 
 
14.8 Communication and Publication of  Results  
This study will be registered in Clinicaltrials.gov and the EudraCT database. Study  results 
will be submitted to EudraCT in accordance with timelines for pediatric studies according 
to The European Clinical Trials Directive  2001/20/EC.  
In accordance  with FDAAA  801 requirements  this study  will be registered  and have  results 
submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov according to the published  guidelines.  
The investigator has the right to publish study results from his/her specific site. However, 
any publication that includes AMO Pharma confidential information cannot be submitted 
for publication without AMO Pharma's prior written approval.  
Both authors and publishers have ethical obligations. In publication of the results of 
research, the investigators are obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results. Negative as 
well as positive results should be published or otherwise publicly available. Sources of 
funding, institutional affiliations and any possible conflicts of interest should be declared 
in the publication. Reports of experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid 
down in this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.  
 
 
14.9 Indemnification  
In the event of study -related damage or injuries, the public liability insurance of the 
Sponsor provides compensation for claims that arise in accordance with the regulatory 
requirements  of the countries  involved,  except  for claims  that arise  from  wilful  misconduct 
or gross negligence. A copy of the insurance certificates will be held in the Trial Master 
File and in the Investigator Site  File.

APPENDIX B: Clinical Global Impressions (Severity and Improvement)  
 
CGI -S and CGI -I 
The Clinical Global Impression – Severity of Illness (CGI -S) and Clinical Global 
Impression – Improvement of Illness (CGI -I) are brief, easy to administer, clinician -rated 
measures (Guy, 1976). The CGI -S asks the clinician to rate the patient’s current severity 
of illness based on the clinician’s total clinical experience with the relevant population. 
The CGI -S is rated on a 7 -point scale, with a range of responses from 1 (normal, not at all 
ill) through  7 (amongst  the most  extremely  ill patients).  The CGI-I asks the clinician  to rate 
the patients’ total improvement since baseline, whether or not the improvement is judged 
to be due entirely  to the experimental  treatment.  The CGI-I is rated  on a 7-point  scale,  with 
a range of responses from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). For both the 
CGI-S and the CGI -I, the clinician is allowed to use all available information at the time 
of the  rating.  
The CGI -I has emerged as a convention for bifurcating clinical trial subjects into 
“responders” and “non -responders”. In this application, the CGI -I can be a useful tool for 
gaining a general overview of the therapeutic potential of an experimental treatment. One 
of the relative  detriments  of both the CGI-S and  –I is the lack of the measures’  assessment 
of specific  sign or symptoms  associated  with the disorder  under  study  (Busner  et al., 2009). 
An approach  that has been  developed  to enhance  the precision  and clinical  meaningfulness 
of CGI ratings  is to utilize  anchor  points  that are specific  to the signs and  symptoms  of the 
disorder under  study.

Clinical Global Impression – Severity of Illness Scale (CGI -S): 
“Considering your total clinical experience with myotonic dystrophy patients, how 
severely ill is this patient at this time?”  
 
1- Normal, not at all ill : The patient is indistinguishable from other individuals that do not 
have myotonic dystrophy  (DM). The patient has no overt DM symptoms and no persistent 
dysfunction in the wake of having been diagnosed with  DM. 
2- Borderline ill : The patient has very occasional DM symptoms that seem modestly 
excessive in intensity, frequency or duration compared to individuals that have not been 
diagnosed  with DM. These  symptoms  have  only a transient  impact  on functioning,  with no 
need for any special  intervention.  
3- Mildly ill : The patient has occasional DM symptoms that seem modestly excessive in 
intensity or duration, or the patient experiences very occasional DM symptoms that are 
modestly  excessive  both in intensity  and duration  as compared  to individuals  without  a DM 
diagnosis. These symptoms have a limited impact on the patient’s functioning, generally 
only in one setting, and require that others make some adjustments or accommodations in 
interacting with this  patient.  
4- Moderately ill : This DM patient is clearly distinguishable from other individuals because 
of his/her  DM symptoms  and the impairment  that they cause.  The patient’s  DM symptoms 
are clearly excessive in frequency, intensity or duration compared to others that have not 
received a DM diagnosis, and have limited impact on the patient’s functioning in multiple 
settings or moderate impact in one setting. Caregivers, family members, teachers and co- 
workers make adjustments when interacting with this patient to avoid exacerbation of 
his/her symptoms and to deal with them when they  occur.  
5- Markedly  ill: This patient’s  DM symptoms  occur  frequently  and are noticeable  in intensity 
or duration to even casual observers or occur infrequently but are quite intense or long - 
lasting. There is moderate impact on the patient’s functioning in multiple settings or 
extreme  impact  in one setting.  Caregivers,  family  members,  teachers  and co-workers  utilize 
interventions that are necessary in order to deal with this patient’s symptoms. Special 
accommodations  related  specifically  to the patient’s  DM symptoms  are likely  necessary  at 
home, at school or in the workplace.  
6- Severely ill : The patient’s DM symptoms occur very frequently and are noticeable in 
intensity  or duration  to even  casual  observers  or occur  infrequently  but are severely  intense 
or extremely long -lasting. Often there is marked impairment of normal day –to–day 
capabilities or skills necessary to function at school or in the workplace. Multiple 
interventions are required to address the patient’s DM symptoms to minimize 
consequences.  
7- Among the most extremely ill patients : The patient’s DM symptoms occur the majority of 
the time and are very disruptive  to functioning  in multiple  areas.  There  are very few times,

if any, of normal functioning. There are often serious concerns about the patient’s ability 
to provide adequate care for him/herself as a consequence of the DM symptoms. The 
patient requires almost constant monitoring by caregivers or others.

CGI —Improvement – A User’s Guide  
1. Very Much Improved  designates marked improvement, across settings and/or across 
multiple problem areas. Although a CGI -I of 1 does not strictly require that the patient 
qualify  for a CGI-S rating  better  than baseline,  usually  the CGI-S does also improve.  Such 
improvement must be very substantial and is usually accompanied by considerable  patient 
and/or  caregiver  enthusiasm.  Such  patients  are usually  noticeably  improved  in the clinic  as 
well.  
2. Much  Improved  may denote  moderate  improvement  in a single  symptom  area,  especially 
if seen across  settings.  Likewise,  moderate  improvements  in several  areas,  even if confined 
to one setting, may warrant a rating of “Much improved.” Durability of the change should 
be taken into account. For example, a change reported for the last few hours probably 
would not warrant such a rating. On the other hand, a change that was clearly in evidence 
for the last several days or longer probably would warrant a rating of 2.  It is not necessary 
that the patient qualify for a CGI -S rating better than baseline to receive a CGI —I rating 
of 2, but often (not always) the CGI -S also  improves.  
3. Minimal Improvement  indicates modest improvements, especially if confined to one 
setting. Trivial changes or changes that are possibly present or require guesswork usually 
would be scored as 4 (the level below this  one).  
4. No Change  indicates, by definition, the absence of change in behavior or clinical 
presentation from baseline to subsequent assessments. Chance fluctuations and equivocal 
improvements or declines should be included  here.  
5. Minimally Worse  indicates some worsening in symptoms that are mild to moderate or 
may be confined to one  setting.  
6. Much Worse  designates moderate to moderately serve worsening. This may include 
moderate levels of worsening in a single symptom area when observed across settings. 
Moderately  severe  changes  that are confined  to one setting  may warrant  a rating  of “Much 
Worse.”  
7. Very Much Worse  designates significant worsening, across settings and/or across 
multiple  symptoms.  
N.B. The CGI -I is a rating of change ; normalization is not necessary for a rating of 1, 
although if the clinical presentation is unequivocally improved and is evident across 
settings, it suggests an Improvement score of 1. A CGI -I of 2 is appropriate for definite, 
unequivocal improvement of a magnitude that makes the clinician confident that the 
treatment  is helping.  An improvement  score  of 3 (or 5) is appropriate  if variations  in ratings 
and other criteria appear to represent more than random chance or rating error, but are  not

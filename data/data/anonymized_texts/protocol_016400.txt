STATEMENT	OF	THE	PROBLEM		1.1 OBJECTIVE	This	study’s	goals	are	to:	1)	use	free-breathing	magnetic	resonance	imaging	(FB-MRI)	to	measure	fetal	body	composition	in	the	third	trimester	and	2)	determine	how	the	FB-MRI	quantitative	measurements	compare	to	growth	parameters	at	birth.		1.2 HYPOTHESES	AND	SPECIFIC	AIMS		To	accomplish	our	objectives,	our	aims	and	hypotheses	are	as	follows:		Specific	Aim	1:		In	a	prospective	study	in	women	with	healthy	pregnancies	and	women	with	fetuses	that	have	intrauterine	growth	restriction	(IUGR)	and	gestational	diabetes,	we	will	quantify	fetal	subcutaneous,	visceral,	and	brown	adipose	tissue	volumes	and	proton-density	fat	fraction	(PDFF)	using	FB-MRI	in	the	third	trimester.	Hypothesis	1:	Using	a	FB-MRI	technique	we	will	find	the	following,	1) The	growth	restricted	fetus	will	have	less	visceral,	subcutaneous,	and	brown	adipose	tissue	volume	and	PDFF	when	compared	to	healthy	fetuses	and	fetuses	whose	mothers	have	gestational	diabetes.	2) Fetuses	whose	mothers	have	gestational	diabetes	will	have	a	greater	subcutaneous	and	visceral	adipose	tissue	volume	and	PDFF	compared	to	healthy	fetuses.		Specific	Aim	2:		In	a	prospective	study	in	pregnant	women	and	their	fetuses,	we	will	compare	volume	and	PDFF	measurements	of	fetal	visceral,	subcutaneous,	and	brown	adipose	tissue	obtained	with	FB-MRI	to	birth	growth	parameters	of	these	infants.			Hypothesis	2:	The	volume	and	PDFF	of	fetal	visceral	and	subcutaneous	adipose	tissue	will	correlate	positively	with	birth	weight	and	length	z-score.																	
	4			1.3a.	BACKGROUND:	Pediatric	obesity	is	a	public	health	crisis	with	increasing	prevalence	worldwide.	19%	of	children	and	adolescents	in	the	United	States	are	obese1.		Pediatric	obesity	is	associated	with	an	increased	risk	for	adult	onset	metabolic	syndrome,	which	refers	to	the	co-occurrence	of	obesity,	insulin	resistance,	dyslipidemia,	hypertension,	and	non-alcoholic	fatty	liver	disease2.		There	is	also	a	tremendous	amount	of	evidence	suggesting	that	obesity	and	the	metabolic	syndrome	have	fetal	origins	due	to	abnormal	fetal	growth	and	maternal	conditions3-6.				Impaired	fetal	growth	is	a	major	cause	of	perinatal	morbidity	and	mortality.		Infants	with	intrauterine	growth	restriction	(IUGR)	and	infants	who	are	born	small	for	gestational	age	(SGA)	and	large	for	gestational	age	(LGA)	have	an	increased	risk	for	future	obesity,	insulin	resistance,	cardiovascular	disease,	and	associated	metabolic	complications.		IUGR	infants	have	been	found	to	have	insulin	resistance	due	to	epigenetic	changes	in	the	liver	and	reduced	pancreatic	beta	cell	mass3.		IUGR	infants	also	exhibit	satiety	dysregulation	secondary	to	impaired	leptin	and	ghrelin4.				Maternal	conditions	such	as	obesity	and	hyperglycemia	in	pregnancy	may	also	play	a	role	in	the	infant’s	risk	factors	for	obesity.	Meta-analyses	demonstrated	that	a	maternal	body	mass	index	(BMI)	in	the	obese	range,	glycemia,	and	birthweight	are	related	to	childhood	obesity	and	insulin	resistance5,6.		In	short,	a	person’s	fetal	experience	and	birth	weight	appear	to	be	surrogates	for	future	metabolic	health.			Body	composition	parameters	can	also	be	important	biomarkers	for	future	metabolic	health.		Body	composition	is	the	measurement	of	the	different	tissues	of	the	body	including	adipose	tissue	muscle,	and	bone.		Fat	can	be	categorized	by	location	(visceral	vs.	subcutaneous)	and	type	(white	vs.	beige	vs.	brown).		Visceral	fat	is	located	beneath	the	abdominal	muscles	while	subcutaneous	fat	sits	directly	beneath	the	skin.	Visceral	fat	is	composed	of	mainly	white	fat	and	is	metabolically	active.		Visceral	fat	releases	free	fatty	acids	into	the	circulation	which	can	lead	to	insulin	resistance7,	dyslipidemia7,	hypertension8,9,	and	fatty	liver8,9.		Studies	demonstrated	a	significant	correlation	between	the	proportion	of	visceral	adiposity	in	children	and	adults	with	obesity	and	the	metabolic	syndrome7.		In	infants,	increased	fat	mass	gains	and	rapid	weight	gain	(weight	z-score	>0.67	in	the	first	two	years	of	life)	have	been	associated	with	later	onset	obesity,	insulin	resistance,	hypertension,	and	non-alcoholic	fatty	liver	disease8,9.				In	contrast	to	white	adipose	tissue,	brown	adipose	tissue	is	responsible	for	thermogenesis	and	energy	expenditure,	and	is	generally	located	near	the	spine,	and	supraclavicular,	axillary,	and	supraclavicular	regions.	Traditionally,	brown	adipose	tissue	was	thought	to	be	only	present	in	the	newborn.		However,	research	now	demonstrates	that	brown	adipose	tissue	is	present	in	children	and	adults10.When	compared	to	white	adipose	tissue,	brown	adipose	tissue	has	a	higher	water:adipose	tissue	ratio,	is	mitochondria-rich,	and	has	a	dense	supply	of	capillaries	for	oxygen	consumption.	Research	demonstrates	that	brown	adipocytes	may	protect	against	insulin	resistance	and	obesity.		There	is	now	research	being	conducted	on	how	to	convert	visceral	white	adipose	tissue	to	brown	adipose	tissue11.		It	is	important	to	be	mindful	that	body	composition	can	be	measured	using	different	technologies:	dual-energy	X-ray	absorptiometry	(DXA),	computed	tomography	(CT),	ultrasound,	air	displacement	plethysmography	(ADP,	commercially	known	as	the	PeaPod),	and	magnetic	resonance	imaging	(MRI).		DXA	and	ADP	cannot	be	used	in	a	fetal	model	due	to	poor	image	quality.	DXA	is	able	to	estimate	the	amount	of	subcutaneous	and	visceral	adipose	tissue	within	the	android	region,	and	correlates	well	with	
	5	CT12.		However,	DXA	and	CT	both	require	radiation,	which	is	undesirable	for	the	fetus	and	child.	While	ultrasound	does	not	involve	radiation,	is	an	inexpensive	imaging	tool,	and	can	be	used	in	the	utero	and	extra-utero	environment,	ultrasound	is	dependent	on	the	skill	of	the	sonographer	and	results	can	be	variable.	In	contrast,	MRI	is	a	noninvasive	imaging	tool	that	does	not	involve	ionizing	radiation	and	can	be	used	to	accurately	and	longitudinally	quantify	the	volume	of	adipose	tissue.		MRI	can	also	measure	the	proton-density	fat	fraction	(PDFF)	in	percent,	which	is	used	as	a	biomarker	for	tissue	fat	content.		Fetal	MRI	is	becoming	increasingly	utilized	as	an	adjunct	to	ultrasound	for	maternal	or	fetal	conditions	related	to	pregnancy.		The	American	College	of	Obstetricians	and	Gynecologists	released	a	statement	in	2017	stating	that	MRI	is	not	dangerous	and	should	be	used	prudently	to	answer	a	clinical	question.		Today,	MRI	is	commonly	utilized	in	cases	of	placenta	accreta13	and	fetal	anomalies	such	as	congenital	diaphragmatic	hernia,	congenital	heart	disease,	and	neurological	anomalies.		There	are	difficulties	with	fetal	MRI	due	to	lack	of	control	of	fetal	movement.		Our	group	has	developed	a	free-breathing	(FB)	MRI	technique	and	has	utilized	this	technology	in	adults,	pregnant	women,	adolescents,	and	infants14-18.		To	date,	there	has	been	little	research	pertaining	to	fetal	body	composition	using	MRI.		Previously,	using	T1-weighted	MR	images,	it	has	been	difficult	to	detect	adipose	tissue	in	the	second	trimester19,20.		Blondiaux	et	al	(2018)	looked	at	subcutaneous	adipose	tissue	in	T1-weighted	images	starting	in	the	second	trimester	and	found	the	signal	was	isointense	at	26	weeks	and	all	areas	were	hyperintense	by	33	weeks	in	a	progressive	fashion	from	the	nuchal	region,	buttocks,	thigh	and	back21.	However,	now	using	3T	MRI	for	fetal	imaging,	subcutaneous	adipose	tissue	is	more	easily	identified	in	the	mid	and	late	second	trimester22.		1.3b.	PRELIMINARY	DATA:	Our	research	group’s	goal	is	to	use	FB-MRI	to	better	understand	the	early	origins	of	obesity	so	that	we	can	develop	strategies	to	prevent	and	treat	this	disease.		In	adolescents,	we	have	performed	FB-MRI	scans	to	quantify	hepatic	fat	and	compared	these	results	to	reference	breath-held	(BH)	MRI	scans16.			BH-MRI	exhibited	artifacts	and	on	average	covered	only	74%	of	the	liver16.	In	contrast,	FB-MRI	demonstrated	significantly	higher	image	quality	and	covered	100%	of	the	liver16.	Moreover,	when	image	artifacts	in	BH-MRI	were	avoided,	hepatic	PDFF	from	FB-MRI	significantly	correlated	with	BH-MRI	with	a	concordance	correlation	coefficient	of	>0.9916.		In	infants,	we	have	used	FB-MRI	to	quantify	subcutaneous	adipose	tissue,	visceral	adipose	tissue,	brown	adipose	tissue,	and	hepatic	fat	(Figure	1)18.	Of	note,	elevated	hepatic	PDFF	was	measured	in	an	infant	born	large	for	gestational	age	to	a	mother	with	insulin	resistance	and	was	noted	to	be	greater	compared	to	control	infants18.	In	summary,	these	data	show	that	FB-MRI	can	measure	body	composition	and	suggest	that	the	capabilities	of	FB-MRI	can	be	extended	to	the	fetus.			1.4 	JUSTIFICATION	FOR	THE	STUDY:	Significance	and	Innovation	Pediatric	obesity	is	a	significant	public	health	problem	in	the	United	States.	Pediatric	obesity	is	easy	to	diagnose,	but	difficult	to	treat.		If	there	were	early	predictors	in	utero	of	risk	for	developing	obesity,	then	early	intervention	programs	could	be	applied	and	close	nutritional	monitoring	by	the	general	

	6	pediatrician	could	be	performed.		To	solve	this	problem,	we	propose	a	novel	imaging	technology,	FB-MRI,	to	quantify	body	composition.		Based	on	our	preliminary	evidence,	we	believe	FB-MRI	will	allow:	• Early	prediction	of	preliminary	growth	• Close	nutritional	monitoring	given	known	amount	of	adipose	tissue	While	we	know	this	is	an	expensive	tool	that	cannot	be	practically	used	in	the	clinical	setting,	this	can	be	a	tool	to	help	further	research	on	pediatric	obesity.		This	may	also	lead	to	development	of	further	cost	effective	tools	for	the	clinical	setting.			Investigators	Katie	Strobel	is	well	positioned	to	lead	this	study	under	the	close	guidance	of	her	mentors	Dr.	Calkins	and	Dr.	Wu.		This	study	team	is	multi-disciplinary	in	nature	and	emphasizes	team	science.		Dr.	Strobel	is	a	fellow	physician	who	has	worked	with	Dr.	Calkins	for	the	last	three	years	on	research	on	neonatal	growth	in	the	congenital	gastrointestinal	anomaly	population.		Her	work	in	the	gastroschisis	population	is	funded	by	NIH	T32	Gastroenterology	grant.		She	will	also	be	obtaining	a	Masters	in	Clinical	Research	during	her	fellowship.				Dr.	Calkins	has	a	Masters	in	Clinical	Research	and	has	been	conducting	clinical/translational	research	with	a	focus	on	biomarker	science,	predictive	modeling,	and	pediatric	liver	diseases	for	over	seven	years.		The	Neonatology	division	has	provided	Dr.	Calkins	with	start-up	funds	to	conduct	her	clinical/translational	research,	 and	 she	 has	 secured	 a	 career	 development	 award	 along	 with	 private	 foundation	 funding.		Moreover,	the	Neonatology	division	provides	full	support	for	Dr.	Calkins’	research	assistants.			Dr.	 Wu	 has	 worked	on	 the	 development	 of	 new	 MRI	 technologies	 and	 their	 translation	 to	 clinical	applications	 for	 over	 ten	 years.	 Dr.	 Wu’s	 research	 focuses	 on	 new	 quantitative	 MRI	 methods	 and	biomarkers,	robust	free-breathing	3D	MRI,	and	MRI-guided	interventions	for	body	cancers	and	diseases.	He	is	especially	committed	to	the	research	of	new	MRI	techniques	to	improve	the	characterization	of	NAFLD.	The	research	in	Dr.	Wu’s	lab	is	supported	by	intramural	Radiology	and	University	grants,	industry	projects,	and	federal	agencies.			Dr.	Calkins	and	Dr.	Wu	have	applied	for	an	NIH/NIDDK	R01	grant	for	their	free-breathing	MRI	research	in	children	and	infants,	and	have	received	a	very	promising	score	(11th	percentile),	and	anticipate	funding	in	the	near	future.																	
	7				SECTION	2.				2.1	STUDY	DESIGN	This	is	a	prospective	pilot	study	that	will	be	used	to	generate	data	to	provide	a	power	analysis	for	a	larger,	longitudinal	study	that	will	follow	fetuses	at	risk	for	obesity.		2.2	PRIMARY	OUTCOMES:	The	primary	outcome	will	be	visceral	adipose	tissue	volume	and	PDFF	for	the	three	patient	populations:	mothers	with	growth	restricted	fetuses,	mothers	with	gestational	diabetes,	and	mothers	with	healthy	pregnancies.		2.3	SECONDARY	OUTCOMES:	The	secondary	outcomes	will	be	subcutaneous	and	brown	adipose	tissue	volume	and	PDFF,	as	well	as	hepatic	PDFF,	for	the	three	patient	populations	listed	above.		Another	secondary	outcome	will	be	growth	parameters	of	the	neonates.		2.4	POTENTIAL	RISKS	AND	BENEFITS:	Subjects	may	receive	no	benefit	from	participating	in	this	study.	However,	information	from	this	study	may	improve	the	understanding	of	childhood	obesity,	inform	management	strategies,	and	may	help	prognosticate	which	infants	are	at	higher	risk	for	obesity.		The	research	MRI	scans	required	for	this	study	do	not	require	sedation,	involve	ionizing	radiation,	or	require	 any	 contrast	 administration.	 MRI	scans	 are	 a	 painless	 test.	 	 In	 other	 words,	 the	 FB-MRI	performed	for	research	purposes	will	NOT	require	contrast	or	sedation.	However,	patients/subjects	can	experience	claustrophobia	inside	the	MRI	scanner.	Patients	with	a	history	of	claustrophobia	will	be	excluded	from	this	study.	Noise	from	the	scanner	during	an	MRI	scan	will	be	mitigated	by	providing	earplugs	 and	headsets	 to	 the	 patients/subjects.	 Lastly,	 because	 MRI	scans	 use	 magnetic	 fields,	subjects	with	any	metal	(e.g.,	internal	metal	clips	or	implants)	will	be	excluded	from	the	study.		All	subjects	will	be	asked	to	remove	any	metal	(i.e.	earrings,	metal	belts,	etc).			Because	information	will	be	collected	from	each	subjects’	medical	record,	there	is	the	possibility	of	a	breach	of	 confidentiality.	 However,	 all	 precautionary	 measures	 will	 be	 taken	 to	 ensure	 that	confidentiality	 and	 privacy	 is	 maintained,	 and	 that	data	 is	 stored	 securely.	 All	 conversations	 with	subjects	and	their	families	will	occur	in	a	private	setting.				All	data	will	be	coded.		A	code	will	be	kept,	but	it	will	be	kept	on	a	password	protected	computer	and	in	a	password	protected	file	separate	from	the	data.		All	clinical	data	will	be	entered	in	RedCap,	a	secure	web-based	data	management	system	provided	by	the	Clinical	Translational	Science	Institute	at	UCLA	that	only	the	research	team	will	have	access	to.		Continuous	data	generated	from	the	radiological	studies	will	be	entered	into	a	password	protected	Excel	Sheet,	on	a	password	protected	computer,	that	only	the	study	team	has	access	to.	Research	MRI	data	and	analyzed	information	will	be	stored	on	a	password	protected	computer	with	encrypted	storage	media.			All	informed	consents/assents	will	be	stored	in	Dr.	Calkins’	office,	which	is	only	accessible	with	a	key	by	the	study	team,	in	a	locked	cabinet	in	accordance	to	local	IRB	guidelines.		
	8				SECTION	3.		METHODS		3.1	STUDY	POPULATION	In	this	study,	anticipating	a	10-15%	dropout	rate,	we	plan	to	recruit	18	mothers:	6	healthy	pregnant	women,	6	women	with	IUGR	fetuses,	and	5	mothers	with	gestational	diabetes.		3.1.1	INCLUSION	AND	EXCLUSION	CRITERIA	INCLUSION	CRITERIA:	• Pregnant	women	with	singleton	pregnancies	(healthy	cohort)	• Pregnant	women	with	fetuses	with	weights	<	10th	percentile	weight	for	gestational	age	(IUGR	cohort)	• Pregnant	women	with	gestational	diabetes	(diabetes	cohort)		EXCLUSION	CRITERIA:	• Pregnant	minors	• Major	congenital	anomalies	or	disease	processes	in	the	fetus	• Fetus	with	known	chromosomal	anomalies	• Mothers	who	do	not	plan	to	deliver	at	UCLA	• Multiple	pregnancy	(i.e.	twins,	triplets,	etc)	• History	of	claustrophobia	• Contraindications	to	MRI	such	as	metallic	devices	in	the	body	that	are	not	MRI	compatible		3.2.1.	SCREENING		Screening	will	occur	by	a	variety	of	methods	by	all	primary	investigators,	collaborators	and	their	colleagues.		Medical	charts	for	the	potentially	eligible	subjects	at	UCLA	Obstetrics	and	Gynecology	clinics	will	be	screened	to	determine	eligibility	by	PI	Strobel	and	collaborators.		A	HIPAA	waiver	will	be	obtained	and	the	information	will	only	be	collected	if	consent	is	provided.		The	number	of	subjects	screened,	eligible,	and	consented	will	be	recorded	to	track	recruitment.		3.2.2.	CONSENT/ASSENT	PROCEDURES		Consent/assent	will	be	obtained	before	enrollment	for	all	subjects	and	per	local	institutional	review	board	guidelines.	Consent	will	be	diligently	sought	in	an	ethical	manner	and	obtained	using	a	multidisciplinary	approach	(research	coordinator,	principal	investigators	and	co-investigators).		Consents/assents	will	be	provided	to	both	English	and	Spanish;	the	process	of	consenting/assenting	will	occur	in	the	subject’s	primary	language.		Subjects	will	be	provided	with	written	material,	including	a	study	flier/brochure,	and	will	be	given	ample	time	to	review	the	material	and	to	ask	questions.		Consent	will	also	be	obtained	again	prior	to	MRI	procedure.		The	research	team	will	work	with	the	primary	medical	team	to	coordinate	the	introduction	of	the	study	either	before	or	after	their	medical	visit	in	order	minimize	disturbing	the	family	and	work-flow	of	the	clinic.			3.2.3.	MRI	IMAGING	AND	CLINICAL	INFORMATION	OBTAINED	
	9	A.		MRI	Exams	All	MRI	scans	will	be	performed	on	3	T	scanners	(e.g.,	Skyra	or	Prisma,	Siemens)	in	the	outpatient	Magnetic	Resonance	Research	Center	(MRRC)	at	300	UCLA	Medical	Plaza	without	sedation.		Our	newly	developed	FB-MRI	quantification	technique	leverages	a	multi-echo	3D	stack-of-radial	sampling	trajectory	with	golden-angle	acquisition	ordering	to	suppress	motion	artifacts	and	enable	free-breathing	imaging	of	the	abdomen	in	around	 5	minutes.	 In	 addition,	 our	FB-MRI	 technique	is	 compatible	 with	 data	 under	 sampling	 to	accelerate	the	free-breathing	scan	to	1-2	min.	In	this	study,	we	will	optimize	the	parameters	of	our	FB-MRI	technique	(spatial	resolution,	spatial	coverage,	acceleration	factor)	to	balance	trade-offs	between	scan	time,	 image	 quality,	 fat	 quantification	 accuracy,	 and	 patient	 comfort/compliance.	 	Subjects	will	 be	provided	ear	plugs	to	limit	amount	of	noise	from	MRI	machines.		Time	to	complete	scan	and	study	will	be	recorded.		B.		Clinical	Information	Obtained:	Data	will	be	collected	and	include:	maternal	age,	gravida	and	para	status,	gestational	age	at	time	of	image,	gestational	 age	 at	 birth,	maternal	demographic	data,	 maternal	 anthropometrics,	 and	 pregnancy	information.		Neonatal	data	will	also	be	collected	such	as	delivery,	demographics	and	anthropometrics.	This	information	will	be	collected	and	entered		into	a	web-based	database	(RedCap)	using	coded	name.				C.	MRI	Data	Analysis:	MRI	scans	 will	 be	reviewed	by	 co-investigator	Dr.	Masamed	and	 any	 clinically	 concerning	incidental	findings	will	be	reported	to	the	primary	care	clinician.	No	formal	interpretation	is	rendered,	and	copies	of	images	cannot	be	provided.	MRI	data	will	be	reconstructed	by	Siemens	scanner	software	to	produce	3D	fat-water	separated	images	and	PDFF	maps.		The	FB-MRI	radial	data	will	be	transferred	to	a	separate	workstation	for	custom	reconstruction	of	3D	fat-water-separated	images	and	PDFF	maps	and	analysis.	PDFF	values	will	be	directly	measured	from	regions	of	interest	in	the	3D	PDFF	maps	to	characterize	fat	content.	 	 The	 distribution/extent	 of	 subcutaneous	 fat,	 visceral	 fat,	 and	 brown	 fat	 will	 be	 manually	delineated/drawn	on	the	3D	MRI	images	and	PDFF	maps	and	used	to	calculate	volume	of	different	types	of	adipose	tissue.		This	work	will	be	performed	by	PI	Strobel	with	validation	from	PI	Wu.					D.		Satisfaction	Survey:	A	satisfaction	survey	will	be	obtained	from	participant	regarding	consent	process,	coordination	of	scan,	MRI	scan	time	and	how	we	can	improve	our	study.																	
	10				SECTION	4.		ANALYTICAL	PLAN		4.1	SAMPLE	SIZES	AND	POWER	ESTIMATES		This	study	will	not	be	powered	considered	that	this	is	a	pilot	study.		Previous	studies	by	our	group	in	infants/children	have	used	a	sample	size	of	10	to	20	subjects,	and	these	sample	sizes	were	feasible	and	adequate	to	develop	a	new	protocol			4.2	AVAILABLE	POPULATION	Recruitment	will	occur	in	the	UCLA	Santa	Obstetrics	and	Gynecology	clinic	(2001	Santa	Monica	Blvd.	Santa	Monica,	CA),	UCLA	Westwood	Obstetrics	and	Gynecology	clinic	(200	Medical	Plaza	St.	Los	Angeles,	CA),	and	UCLA	Maternal	Fetal	Medicine	clinic	(200	Medical	Plaza.	Los	Angeles,	CA).		We	anticipate	based	on	available	data,	that	there	are	approximately	10	mothers	with	growth	restricted	fetuses	per	month	seen	in	the	UCLA	maternal	fetal	medicine	clinic.		There	are	approximately	12	mothers	with	gestational	diabetes	seen	 per	 month	per	Obstetrics	 and	 Gynecology	 clinic	(Westwood	 and	 Santa	 Monica).	 	 There	 are	approximately	40	healthy	mothers	seen	per	month	per	clinic.				4.3	PROJECTED	RECRUITMENT	TIME	Based	on	the	available	population	and	expected	consent	rate,	we	anticipate	it	will	take	approximately	six	months	to	recruit	mothers	for	each	cohort.		Patients	will	have	MRIs	performed	in	the	third	trimester	(28	weeks	to	40	months),	and	infant	data	will	be	collected	after	completion	of	pregnancy.	Table.

No	adjustments	for	multiple	comparisons	will	be	made	considering	the	exploratory	nature	of	this	study.	The	effect	sizes	measured	in	this	exploratory	grant	will	be	used	as	the	basis	for	power	calculations	for	future	grant	applications.		Data	will	be	reported	in	terms	of	medians	and	interquartile	ranges	and	frequencies.		Ultrasound	growth	parameters	and	birth	growth	parameter	z-scores	will	be	calculated	per	fetal	growth,	WHO,	and	Fenton	growth	charts,	respectively.	Generalized	linear	models	for	repeated	measures	will	be	used	to	compare	weight	and	length	z-scores	to	each	type	of	adipose	volume	and	PDFF	measurement.		Generalized	linear	models	for	repeated	measures	will	be	used	to	compare	maternal	BMI	prior	to	pregnancy	to	adipose	tissue	volumes	and	PDFFs.	Generalized	linear	models	for	repeated	measures	will	be	used	to	compare	ultrasound	growth	 parameters	 to	 adipose	 tissue	 volumes	 and	 PDFFs.	 	 ANOVA	 analyses	 will	 compare	 visceral,	subcutaneous,	and	brown	adipose	tissue	volumes,	and	hepatic	PDFF	across	different	groups	(gestational	diabetes,	IUGR	and	healthy	infants).

	12				SECTION	5.	ADVERSE	EVENTS	5.1	Report	adverse	events					Any	adverse	events	will	be	reported	to	the	OHRPP.		5.2	Potential	Adverse	Events		There	is	some	risk	with	MRI	that	are	similar	to	risks	associated	with	a	clinical	MRI..	While	the	time	required	is	 limited,	 there	 is	 risk	 for	 claustrophobia..	 in	 order	 to	minimize	 this	 risk,	 mothers	 with	 a	 history	 or	suspicion	of	claustrophobia	will	be	excluded	from	participation.		Morever,	should	the	subject	experience	any	 sensation	 of	 claustrophobia,	 the	 research	 related	 procedure	 will	 be	 terminated.	 	 Should	claustrophobia	occur,	terminating	the	FB-MRI	will	result	in	the	alleviation	of	symptoms.		Noise	from	the	scanner	during	MRI	exam	will	be	mitigated	by	providing	earplugs	and	headsets	to	the	patients/subjects.		Lastly,	because	of	MRIs	using	a	magnetic	fields,	subjects	with	any	metal	will	be	excluded	from	the	study.		All	subjects	will	be	asked	to	remove	any	metal	objects	prior	to	study	(e.g.	earrings,	belts).		Because	there	is	a	component	of	chart	review	required,	there	is	a	possibility	of	breech	of	confidentiality.		However,	all	precautionary	measurements	will	be	taken	to	ensure	that	confidentiality	and	privacy	are	maintained,	and	data	will	be	stored	securely.		All	conversations	with	subjects	will	occur	in	a	private	setting.		All	personal	information,	research	data	and	records	will	be	de-identified,	coded	and	securely	stored	to	prevent	access	by	unauthorized	personnel.				5.3	Interim	Monitoring	Plan	and	Stopping	Rules					We	will	not	conduct	a	preliminary	analysis.

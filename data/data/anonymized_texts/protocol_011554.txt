  Page 2 of 7 WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THIS STUDY?  
 
You will arrive at Dr. Casey ’s laboratory after fasting overnight (not eating  or drinking  fluids other than 
water).  Prior to arrival at the laboratory for each study day, you will be emailed an SF -36 Questionnaire 
and asked to have this filled out before arriving.   
 
 You will have 8 small adhesive patches placed on your chest and abdominal areas to measure your heart 
rate using an electrocardiogram  throughout the study.  Your blood pressure will also be monitored 
throughout the study by a temporary  device attached on the end of your  finger (Nexfin).  Your oxygen 
saturation levels will be monitored throughout a portion of the study by a temporary device clipped on the end of your finger.  You will then be asked to lie down on your back on an exam table and rest.  During this study, you will take part in the experimental procedures outlined below.   
 
• Venous blood draw in a vein at the elbow :  About 15- 20 cc (3 -4 teaspoons ) of blood will be 
drawn at the start of the study through a vein at the elbow.  T he skin will be cleaned before th e 
needle is inserted.   
 
• Arterial stiffness measurement: A small, pen -like device that measures blood vessel pressure will 
be placed on the skin over  an artery in your wrist , neck, and groin.  
 
• Breathing through a special face mask :  You will breathe normal air through a mask while 
measurements of heart rate, respiratory rate, and tidal volume are taken.   
 
• Breathing air with a low oxygen content :  For two separate periods  of up to 6 minutes  each , you 
will be asked to breathe air that has a low oxygen content (roughly half that of normal air) through a special face mask.  This will increase your rate of breathing and heart rate and is similar to what happens when you travel to higher altitude (15,000 feet elevation).   
 
• Isometric  forearm muscle contra ction:  You will be asked to squeeze a handgrip device for 2 
minutes.  With 3 seconds remaining you will feel an occlusion cuff (placed on the upper arm) inflate to a high pressure (240 mmHg) and remain inflated for 2 minutes and 15 s econds during 
which time you will lie relaxed face up .   
 
• Rhythmic f orearm muscle contractions :  You will be asked to repeatedly squeeze a handgrip 
device at  a mild and moderate weight (approximately 9 and 18 pounds ).  Each exercise trial will 
last 4 min utes.  
 
• Cold pressor test :  Heart rate and blood pressure will be measured during a 2- minute period of 
cold exposure by placing your  hand in ice water.  
 
• Doppler ultrasound: Will be used to measure blood flow in the elbow artery.  
 
Nitrate consumption :  You will be asked to consume a nitrate rich supplement (BeetElite, Neogenis) 
or placebo for 4 weeks . Both drinks will taste the same. You will have the opportunity to have both

  Page 3 of 7 drinks during the study, and the order that you receive the drink will be ran domized. That means that  
whichever study drink  you receive will be determined purely by chance, like flipping a coin.  You 
will have a 50/50 chance of receiving the nitrate rich supplement first. You will be asked to consume 
one packet (10g) of beetroot powder mixed with 4 ounces of water once a day.  Consumption of each beetroot juice will last for 4 weeks with a 4 week washout period (no juice) in between.  All subjects will consume both beetroot juice with nitrate and placebo during the course of the study. You will not know which juice you are receiving in each 4 week period.  The following is a timeline of the study protocol.  
 
Visit  Time  
Experimental Day #1  3.5 hours  
      Consumption of juice (either nitrate rich or placebo; once a day)  4 weeks  
Experimental Day #2  3.5 hours  
      Washout period  4 weeks  
Experimental Day #3  3.5 hours  
      Consumption of juice (either nitrate rich or placebo; once a day)  4 weeks  
Experimental Day #4  3.5 hours  
 
Visits 2, 3, and 4 will consist of the same testing performed on visit 1 and last up to 3.5 hours each.  
The procedures outlined above are commonly used in the lab.   We plan to keep your initial screening form to possibly contact you for future studies. Ag reeing to be in 
the current study does not obligate you to participate in one of your future studies. A separate Consent Document would be signed for any future studies.  
 At the end of each study day, you will be provided the option to receive a snack, jui ce/water, or a meal 
voucher at the UIHC cafeteria.   
 
Blood/Data Storage for Future Use  
As part of this study, we are obtaining blood samples from you. We would like to study your blood samples in the future, after this study is over.  
 The tests we might want to use to study your blood samples may not even exist at this time. Therefore, we are asking for your permission to store your blood samples so that we can study them in the future.  
These future studies may provide additional inform ation that will be helpful in understanding blood 
vessel function, but it is unlikely that what we learn from these studies will have a direct benefit to you. It is possible that your blood samples might be used to develop products or tests that could be patented and licensed. There are no plans to provide financial compensation to you should this occur.  If you agree now to future use of your blood samples, but decide in the future that you would like to have it removed from future research, you should contact Darren P. Casey at (319) 384- 1009.  
However, if some research with your blood samples has already been completed, the information from that research may still be used.

  Page 4 of 7 WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THIS STUDY?  
You may experience one or more of the risks indi cated below from being in this study. In addition to 
these, there may be other unknown risks, or risks that we did not anticipate, associated with being in this 
study.  
 
1. Insertion of a small needle into the ante -cubital vein at the elbow : The most commo n complications of 
inserting a small needle in the arm is a small bruise and pain at the site of needle insertion  which may 
last several days.  
 
2. Blood withdrawal : Risks associated with withdrawal of 3- 4 teaspoons  of blood from healthy people 
may include feeling light headed or nauseous and/or fainting.  
 
3. Forearm muscle contractions : Handgrip exercise is a commonly used experimental test. There are no 
major risks associated with this procedure. However, isometric and rhythmic handgrip exercise can lead 
to minor fatigue in the forearm and soreness for a day or two.  
 
4. Breathing air with a  low oxygen content : During breathing of air with a low oxygen content, it is 
possible you will feel distress, anxiety, hyperventilate (breathe very quickly), or feel lightheaded.  
These symptoms resolve rapidly when you return to breathing room air.  
 
5. Doppler Ultrasound: There are no risks or harmful effects from Doppler Ultrasound. 
 
6. Applanation tonometry and blood pressure measure ments . There are no risks or harmful effects from 
applanation tonometry or blood pressure measurements. However, inflation of the cuff might cause discomfort for longer time than what is experienced when a doctor or nurse takes  your blood pressure. 
 
7. Col d pressor testing :  The cold pressor test may cause some discomfort in your hand, but you can 
discontinue the trial if you feel  unusual or extreme discomfort.  This discomfort lasts only as long as 
your hand remains immersed in the ice water.  
 
8. ECG (Electrocardiogram) : There is the possibility of an allergic reaction to the ECG electrodes.  
 
9. Consumption of beetroot juice :  There is no risk associated with consumption of beetroot juice.  
However, red urine or stools for 1- 2 days following consum ption have been reported.   
 10. A loss of confidentiality of data is also a risk associated with the study.  
 
 
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF THIS STUDY?  
 
You will not benefit from being in this study.  
 However, we hope that, in the future, other people might be nefit from this study because of the potential 
information gained related to how blood pressure responsiveness is controlled after dietary nitrate supplementation.

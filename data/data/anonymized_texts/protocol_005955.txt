Title of Study  A Partially -Blind, Randomized, Controlled , Parallel -Group Dose Ranging Study to 
Determine the Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of AeroFactTM (SF-RI 1 surfactant 
for inhalation combined with a dedicated drug delivery system ) in Preterm Infants 
at Risk of Worsening Respiratory Distress Syndrome  
Study Centers  Multicenter  
Phase of Development  Phase 2b  
Objectives 
 Part I  
Primary Objective  
To determine an optimal dose of AeroFact ™ administered  to preterm infants on nCPAP or 
nIMV vs. nCPAP or nIMV alone in reducing the incidence of intubation/cannulation and 
bolus surfactant instillation in the first 7 days after birth.  
Secondary Objectives  
• To compare the time to the first intubation/cannulation across groups for infants 
requiring intubation due to surfactant deficiency  
• To compare need for repeat surfactant dosing between groups  within 7 days   
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of AeroFact  administered by inhalation  
 
Part II  
Additional  Objectives 
• To evaluate pulmonary outcomes and respiratory resource utilization at 3, 6, 9, 
and 12 months corrected age  
• To evaluate respiratory morbidity per quarter and compare pulmonary morbidity 
across groups  
• To evaluate early neurologic Gross Motor Function Score ( modified GMFS) 
outcomes at 12 months corrected age  
 
Study Design  
 This partially -blind, randomized, controlled, parallel -group, dose -ranging study is divided 
into 2 Parts.  Part I includes birth through  40 weeks PMA or  hospital discharge (treatment)  
and Part II discharge through 12 months corrected age  (Follow Up).   
Part I  
Part I is to determine the optimal dose of AeroFact  administered to preterm infants on 
nCPAP or nIMV  (Active) vs. nCPAP or nIMV  alone  (Control) in reducing the incidence  
of intubation/cannulation and bolus surfactant instillation in the first 7 days after birth.   261 
preterm infants who are at risk of worsening Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS)  will be 
enrolled .  The AeroFact  dose and dosing strategy determined in this study will be used in 
Aerogen Pharma   Protocol Number   APC -AF-CLN-002 
 
Confidential: APC-AF-CLN -002 Amendment 8- 09 Mar2022 5 a Phase 3 definitive trial.  Preterm infants who require nCPAP (either by bubble CPAP or 
machine CPAP) or nIMV, and meet the inclusion and no exclusion criteria, will be enrolled 
into the study.  
In the delivery room, infants will be stabilized on nCPAP/nIMV  per site clinical  guidelines . 
Once the infant has been stabilized, determined  as eligible, and parental consent obtained, 
the infant will be block randomized in a 1:1:1 partially -blind fashion to receive one of two 
doses of AeroFact or Control. The randomization will be stratifi ed by site and two 
gestational age groups  (26 0/7 to 28 6/7 and 29 0/7 to 31 6/7 weeks) . Patients who meet all 
inclusion and no exclusion criteria and are randomized to receive an Active dose, will have 
the initial assigned treatment administered within the first twe nty-four hours after birth.   
Patients who are assigned to the Control group will continue to receive nCPAP/nIMV .  If 
twins or triplets are enrolled, only the first sibling will be randomized and subsequent 
siblings will receive the same treatment assignment. 
Active treatment dose allocation will be unblinded to pharmacy and  respiratory dosing staff 
or designee s.  All other hospital personnel will be blinded.  Randomization will be a two -
step process.  Step 1: a designated member of the study staff will obtain  a randomization 
envelope for the appropriate gestational age group , which will randomize the infant to 
either the Active or Control  group.   Step 2 : active envelopes will be forwarded to the 
unblinded pharmacist or designee , where the active envelope will  be opened and allocation 
to the Low or High dose group (108 mg/kg or 216 mg/kg)  will be determined.  Active drug 
dose will be calculated and dispensed  according to the pharmacy manual instructions.   
Active  drug will be administered according to study protocol.    
For AeroFact dosing, o xygenation, ventilation parameters, and nasal congestion/aspiration 
will be monitored every 15 minutes for duration of dosing or a minimum of two hours by 
a blinded study/ staff member.   Dosing tolerance will be evaluated at 4 and 24 hours after 
the start of each AeroFact dose.  Oxygenation, ventilation parameters , nasal 
congestion/aspiration  and dosing tolerance will also be collected after each bolus surfactant 
instillation  at similar timepoints .  AeroFact tubing/ nebulizer and vial will remain in place 
for a minimum of 2 hours. The AeroFact delivery system will be removed from the patient’s 
bedside after dosing has been completed  or a minimum of 2 hours.   The patient may be 
transitioned back to their standard nCPAP interface.   A new AeroFact drug delivery circuit 
must be used for each dose administered.  
Infants receiving active drug will continue on nCPAP/nIMV after dose completion.  If 
oxygenation and ventilation requirements increase within 96 hours  of birth, AeroFact 
administration may be repeated up to three times for a total of 4 doses over the first 96 
hours after birth.  Re -dosing of AeroFact  (same randomized group) will be allowed  if the 
RSS is 1.5 to 2.39 and at least two hours have elapsed since the start  of the previous dose :  
• If FiO2 > 0.23, re-dosing will occur.  
• If FiO2 ≤  0.23, re -dosing is at the discretion of the investigator.   
 SpO2 between 90 -95% must  be used to meet study eligibility through 96 hours for all study 
groups (Active/Control).   Site-specific SpO2 clinical guideline s may be used after 96 
hours.  Each site must use th ese guideline s uniformly across treatment groups.   Infants 
randomized to the Control group  will be clinically managed unt il the criteria for treatment 
escalation have been met.  If at any time the criteria for treatment escalation are met in any 
of the three treatment arms, intubation and/or bolus instillation of surfactant may be 
administered at the discretion of the clinical team.    
 
Criteria for treatment escalation for  AeroFact or Control groups include any  of the

Study 
Treatment(s) Infants will be block randomized in a 1:1:1  fashion to Active or Control .  Stratification 
across all groups will be by site and gestational age (26 0/7 to 28 6/7 and 29 0/7 to 31 6/7 
weeks) .  Patients randomized to Active drug will receive 1  of 2 nominal dose  levels  of 
AeroFact (108 mg/kg  or 216 mg/kg ).   
Up to three additional doses of AeroFact  within 96 hours  of birth will be allowed  if RSS 
is 1.5 to 2.39 and at least two hours have elapsed since the start of the previous dose :  
• If FiO2 > 0.23, re-dosing will occur .  
• If FiO2 ≤  0.23, re-dosing is at the discretion of the investigator.   
SpO2 between 90-95% must  be used to  meet study eligibility through 96 hours for all study 
groups (Active/Control).   Site-specific SpO2 clinical guidelines may be used after 96 
hours.  Each site must use th ese guidelines uniformly across treatment groups.  
All infants randomize d will be clinically managed unt il the criteria for treatment escalation 
have been met.   
Concomitant Therapy  
 The use of Vitamin A or corticosteroids for BPD  prophylaxis  must be consistent, 
and appropriate for age, for  all enrolled infants within each study site.  
The routine use of corticosteroids for blood pressure (BP) or adrenal support should be 
avoided during the first 96 hours after birth.  
HFNC  and RA M Cannula are not permitted in the first 96 hours of life.  
Duration of Treatment The duration of study participation for each infant is as follows:  
Part I:  
• Treatment Period:  96 hours

(If an infant is discharged from the NICU prior to 36 and/or 40 weeks, a study 
member will call the family to verify the respiratory support status.)  
 
 
Safety and Tolerability Assessments  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed through the monitoring of oxygenation , 
bradycardia, nasal congestion/ aspiration, and  other adver se events of interest (AEs) to 40 
weeks PMA or discharge. I ncidence of comorbidities of prematurity/AE’s will be assessed. 
Tolerance of the AeroFact dosing administration and all doses of bolus surfactant will be 
assessed during and up to 24 hours following dosing.   
Part II:  
Additional Efficacy  Endpoints 
• Assessment of pulmonary outcomes at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months corrected age   
• Length of NICU Stay (LOS)  
• Proportion of subjects with any respiratory resource utilization at 3, 6, 9 and 12 
months corrected age  
• Respiratory morbidity per quarter till 12 months  of corrected age  
• Assessment  of modified GMFS (early neurologic ) at 12 months of corrected age  
 
Criteria for 
Individual 
Patient Discontinuation  Aerogen Pharma , the Investigator or parent  (s) may discontinue pre -term infants from the 
study at any time for the following reasons:  
• Safety  
• Withdrawal of parental consent  
• At the discretion of the Investigator  
Statistical Considerations 
 Randomization, Stratification and Sample Size:  
Two hundred and sixty-one (261) subjects (87 in each arm) will be randomized in a 1:1:1 
ratio in order to assure that 246 subjects (82 in each arm) complete the study. The 
randomiz ation will  be stratified by site and  gestational age.  
Infants requiring treatment escalation in the AeroFact dose groups is estimated to be 20% 
and in the control group is estimated to be 40% , with an odds ratio of 0.375.  
Under the above assumptions, 82 subjects in each treatment group will be required, to meet 
the Type I error rate of 0.05 and 80% statistical power. To accommo date the potential 
dropouts, a 5% dropout rate is included in this sample size calculation.  
Analyses Populations:  
Aerogen Pharma   Protocol Number   APC -AF-CLN-002 
 
Confidential: APC-AF-CLN -002 Amendment 8- 09 Mar2022 9 Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population:  The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population is defined as all 
randomized subjects. The ITT population will be the primary population for the primary, 
secondary and additional efficacy analysis.  
Per Protocol (PP) population : The Per Protocol (PP) population is defined as all 
randomized subjects who were not associated with a major protocol violation. The PP 
analysis of primary, secondary and additional endpoints will be considered supportive.  
Safety population:  The Safety population is defined as all randomized subjects . This 
population will be used for the analysis of safety parameters.  
 
 Interim 
Analysis  
 
   A blinded interim analysis is planned and will be conducted when approximately 60% of 
subjects have been randomized and completed first 7 days of life or early terminated, 
whichever occurs first.  
The main purpose of this interim analysis will be:  
• sample size re -assessment to evaluate the final sample size needed to proceed with 
the study based on the control responder rate at interim analysis, and; to evaluate 
the safety of AeroFact on the frequency of adverse events , nasal 
congestion/aspiration, dosing tolerance events , and serious adverse events  
Efficacy 
Analyses  The primary analyses of the primary, secondary, and additional efficacy endpoints will be 
conducted on the ITT population. The PP population analyses of primary, secondary, and 
additional endpoints will be considered supportive.  
For the efficacy endpoints the data will be summarized and compared according to the 
variable type:  
• Continuous data summaries will include:  
o Descriptive summary of number of observations, mean, standard 
deviation, median, and minimum and maximum values.   
o Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) or Mixed Model Repeated 
Measures (MMRM) adjusted for stratification factors for inferential 
statistics.  
• Categorical data summaries will include:  
o Frequency counts and percentages  
o Logit model or Generalized  Estimating Equation (GEE)  method  adjusted 
for stratification factors  and clustering of multiple births within a mother 
for inferential statistics  
• Time-dependen t data: Cox proportional hazards model will be used to analyze 
time dependent data and to depict the time to event data.  
Safety Analyses  
 Safety will be  evaluated on the Safety Population .   
The number and percent of infants experiencing TEAEs, serious adverse events, and 
TEAEs leading to study discontinuation will be summarized for each treatment group by 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA) system organ class and/or preferred 
term. Additional summaries will include TEAE severity a nd relationship to study drug.

2.1 Introductio n 
Aerogen Pharma is developing AeroFact , an investigational drug/device combination product 
consisting of lyophilized bovine -origin surfactant SF -RI 1 (sold in Europe since 1989 under the 
proprietary name Alveo Fact®) administered following reconstitution to a 45 mg/ml suspension with 
semi -isotonic saline buffer using a proprietary breath -actuated vibrating mesh nebulizer with a nasal 
cannula interface. 
Current surfactants used for prevention or treatment of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in 
preterm infants are approved for delivery only as a liquid bolus instillation via an endotracheal tube 
(ETT) while intubated/cannulated.  Intubation and cannulation with a tube into the trachea for 
surfactant administration are associated with adverse even ts (AEs) [1,2,3] .  Access to surfactant 
therapy without invasive procedures that further exacerbate the condition is therefore a major unmet medical need in this vulnerable population.  Reports suggest that AEs caused by intubation or 
cannulation can be av oided if there is a means of non- invasive delivery, i.e. aerosolized surfactant 
delivered through nasal continuous positive airway pressure (n CPAP ) [5].  
Current the rapies for RDS in preterm infants are associated with the following challenges: 
• Endotracheal  intubation of preterm infants is an invasive procedure associated with airway 
tissue trauma, vagal stimulation, hypoxia, and bradycardia  [1,2,3] .  Additionally, insertion 
of small catheters into the infant trachea and positioning above the bifurcation can be 
traumatic.  Both techniques require specialized skills, medical support, and training that 
must be kept current via frequent practice.  
• Liquid bolus surfactant instillation via ETT is associated with airway obstruction (due to the 
large v olume of liquid relative to preterm infant lung volumes) and transient physiological 
events such as hypoventilation, hyperventilation, changes in systemic blood pressure, 
alterations of cerebral blood flow, and other pulmonary and neurological effects.  
• Respiratory support with nCPAP alone, albeit less traumatic compared to 
intubation/mechanical ventilation, results in delayed delivery of surfactant or absence of exogenous surfactant administration.  This can lead to:  
o Atelectasis  
o Stress within the lungs associated with pneumothoraxes and bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia (BPD)  
o Increased fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO
2) requirements, which are associated 
with lung toxicity and ophthalmic vascular changes leading to R etinopathy of 
Prematu rity (ROP)  
o Ventilation/perfusion mismatching resulting in intra -pulmonary and intra -cardiac 
shunts 
In summary, as practice has evolved, many clinicians avoid subjecting preterm infants to risk of 
intubation/cannulation and instillation of liquid bolus surfactant until RDS has progressed to moderate or severe levels.

2.2.1 Nonclinical Experience 
SF-RI 1 (the drug component of Aerofact)  delivered as a bolus instillation  has been assessed in a 
series of nonclinical studies in order to gain regulatory approval in several European countries and 
territories around the world.   (Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure on non- clinical trials 
conducted with Alveofact ). These nonclinical studies have been deemed acceptable to support the 
safety of SF -RI 1 for intratracheal bolus instillation in preterm neonates.    
Several studies comparing IT instillation of surfactant to nebulized surfactant indicate potential 
advantages to inhaled aerosol therapy.  Efficacy  has been demonstrated by the Sponsor, using 
aerosolized SF -RI 1.  In these studies, using a breath synchronized vibrating mesh nebulizer , similar 
to the clinical delivery platform, rabbits with surfactant depleted lungs from repeated saline washes, 
showed improvement in the oxygenation index and ventilation efficiency index after intratracheal 
delivery of aerosolized SF -RI 1. T hese data support the safe use of aerosolized SF-RI 1 in  
preventing progression of infant respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) when delivered either as a 
bolus instillation or as an aerosol.   
Because SF -RI 1 administration  with Aerofact  is by a new route (nebulized aerosol passing through  
the neonate’s  nose to be delivered  to the lungs), the potential toxicity of SF -RI 1 to the nasal cavity, 
and general lung tolerability, were evaluated by the Sponsor in support of the proposed clinical development program.  Specifically, the toxicity and local tolerability of SF -RI 1 were assessed in 
two 14-day GLP studies, one in post -weanling Sprague Dawley rats and one in post -weanling New 
Zealand White rabbits.   For these studies, nose only inhalation was  used as this is the intended 
clinical route. Additionally, the drug was administered daily for 14 consecutive days, which exceeds the frequency of dosing in the clinical situation.   The high dose in the 14- day animal studies was 
determined by using the maximum feasible concentration for SF -RI 1 in an attempt to obtain an 
acceptable margin over the anticipated clinical dose. In both studies standard parameters were 
assessed including, body weight, food consumption, clinical observations, clinical pathology 
(hematology, coagulation and clinical chemistry) and ophthalmology, as well as a complete 
necropsy and histopathology of over 50 tissues.    No adverse effects were observed in any standard 
assessment of toxicity, including the electrocardiogram.  Technical issues with the rabbit study 
resulted in low er-than-targeted  aerosol exposure .  Inflammation and increased alveolar 
macrophages were present in all treatment groups including the control .  Therefore,  a No-Observed -
Adverse- Effect -Level (NOAEL ) was not determined. In rats, based on the absence of any adverse 
findings in any of the measured parameters, the NOAEL  from 14 days of nose -only inhalation of 
SF-RI 1 was considered to be the maximal feasible dose of 1,223 mg/kg/day.  
2.2.2 Clinical Experience  
More detailed summaries of AeroFact clinical experience can be found in the Investigator Brochure.  
APC-AF-CLN -001, a  Phase 2a study of AeroFact , was performed in three clinical centers  in 
Australia .  Only two of the centers enrolled subjects .  The third site withdrew from the study prior 
to enrolling any subjects.   The enrollment period was 21 Novem ber 2017 to 1 August 2018.  The 
study was An Open -Label Study of the Safety and Tolerability of AeroFact
TM (Aerosolized 
Alveofact®) in Preterm Infants on nCPAP at Risk of Worsening Respiratory Distress Syndrome.  
Aerogen Pharma   Protocol Number APC -AF-CLN -002 
 
Confidential: APC-AF-CLN -002 Amendment 8- 09 Mar2022 20 The study was conducted in 2 parts, Part I , single dose and Part II , multiple dose. Each part was 
conducted in a separate group of preterm infants.    
Infants who were 26 0/7 to 30 6/7 weeks gestational age at birth, required CPAP or nIMV after the 
delivery room, and satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled within two hours into 
this study.  For each enrolled infant, retrospective data was collected on 3 comparative infants of 
the same gestational age who were born within the two previous years . 
AeroFact treatment failure criteria for intubation and bolus instillation of surfactant were one or more of the following:  
1.  R SS ≥ 2.4  
2. PCO 2 > 65 mmHg and/or pH < 7.20  
3. nCPAP > 8 cm  
4. Three severe apneas with bradycardia within six hours requiring escalation of support  
Infants were followed for their need for AeroFact and/or bolus dosing of surfactant . Tolerance of 
Aerofact dosing  had the following data collected: changes in respiratory support over the first  28 
days of life, BPD  status at 36 weeks PMA and co -morbidities of prematurity/AEs monitored until 
the time of discharge.  
2.2.2.1  APC- AF-CLN -001 Part I  
Part I of the study was designed to determine the safety and tolerability of administering a single 
nominal dose of 216 mg/kg of aerosolized AeroFact (SF -RI 1) by nCPAP.  Ten preterm infants 
who required nCPAP (machine CPAP) and satisfied the inclusion and e xclusion criteria were 
enrolled into this part of the study. 
After successful completion of Part I and a proceed recommendation by an Independent Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB), sites were permitted to begin enrollment into Part II of the study. 
2.2.2.2  APC- AF-CLN -001 Part II  
Part II of the study was designed to determine the safety and tolerability of administering up to four 
doses of aerosolized AeroFact (SF -RI 1) by nCPAP. Twenty (21) preterm infants were enrolled 
into this part of the study.  
An initial nominal dose of 216 mg/kg of aerosolized SF -RI 1 was administered. Oxygenation and 
ventilation parameters were monitored as outlined in the protocol .  Infants continue d on nCPAP. 
Re-dosing of AeroFact (nominal dose of 216 mg/kg) occurred if the RSS to maintain SpO 2 between 
90% and 95% (as measured by pulse oximetry) ≥  2.0 and at least (1) 2  hours elapsed since the end 
of the first dose and (2) 4 hours elapsed since the end of either the second or third dose. Up to 3 
additional doses of AeroFact within 96 hours were allowed.

2.2.3.1  APC- AF-CLN -001- Safety Analysis Conclusions :  
• The overall incidence of TEAEs was low among AeroFact pati ents; 3 patients (30%) had 1 
or more TEAE(s) in Part I, and 5 patients (23.8%) had 1 or more TEAE(s) in Part II.  
• There were no TEAEs which were assessed by the Investigator as related to the study drug, 
device, or procedure, and none led to premature discontinuation from the study drug or 
premature discontinuation from the study.  
• The most common TEAEs reported were patent ductus arteriosus occurring for 1 patient 
(10%) in Part 1 and for 3 patients (9.5%) in Part II, and pneumothorax occurring for 1 patient 
(10%) in Part 1 and 1 patient (4.8%) in Part II.  
• All TEAEs in Part I were mild and the majority of TEAEs in Part II were mild with a severe TEAE occurring in 1 patient (4.8%)  (pulmonary hemorrhage identified after intubation) . 
• During Day 1 to study Day 4, following AeroFact dosing, there was 1 occurrence (10%) of 
moderate nasal congestion in Part I, and 5 occurrences (23.8%) of moderate nasal 
congestion and 1 occurrence (4.8%) of severe nasal congestion in Part II of the study. Nasal 
aspiration occurred in 2 patients (9.5%) in Part II on Day 1 in the study.  Neither nasal 
congestion or nasal aspiration data were available from the historical control patients for comparison. 
• One patient in Part I and 1 patient in Part II of the study had an SAE. Both patients  had the 
SAE of culture -proven sepsis, which was not related to the study drug, the device, or the 
procedure, did not emerge during the treatment period, and resulted in death.  
• Generally, the incidence of AEs associated with dosing tolerance in the first 2 4 hours was 
low; the incidence of AEs for AeroFact only vs. AeroFact plus bolus surfactant demonstrated comparability.  
• The incidence of post -dose comorbidities of prematurity and AEs was low and consistent 
between the patients treated with AeroFact vs. his torical controls.  
2.2.3.2   APC- AF-CLN -001- Efficacy Analysis Conclusions:  
• At 36 Weeks PMA, a larger proportion of patients receiving AeroFact in Part I and Part II 
of the study survived without BPD (88.9% and 78.9%, respectively) compared with Part I 
and Part II h istorical control patients (73.3% and 66.7%, respectively).    
• The median (range) length of stay in the NICU for AeroFact patients in Part I and Part II was comparable to historical control patients.  
• For AeroFact patients in Part I and Part II, the median time -to-failure using AeroFact criteria 
was consistently numerically greater than for historical control patients.  
• For AeroFact patients in Part II, the median time -to-instilled surfactant was consistently 
numerically greater than for Part II historical c ontrol patients.  
• No patients in the AeroFact group or in the historical control group required instilled surfactant after 72 hours of life.

Confidential: APC-AF-CLN -002 Amendment 8- 09 Mar2022 22 • For patients receiving AeroFact treatment in Part II, the proportion of patients requiring 
rescue with instilled sur factant was lower than for the matched historical controls (25% vs 
45%); this corresponded to a relative risk of 0.56, in favor of AeroFact treatment.  
 Study APC -AF-CLN -001 overall conclusions : 
• Administration of AeroFact, up to 4 doses within 96 hours of life, was shown to be safe and well tolerated in patients ranging from 26 2/7 weeks to 30 4/7 weeks of gestational age and 
with weights between 640 to 1,664 grams.  
• No AeroFact -treated patients i n Part I or Part II of the study, or among the matched historical 
controls, received instilled surfactant beyond 72 hours of life.  
• The need for rescue therapy by instilled bolus surfactant was lower in Part II of the study 
compared with matching historica l controls; 5 AeroFact patients (25%) in Part II required 
rescue with surfactant bolus instillations vs. 27 patients (45%) who required instillations in the matching historical control group; this corresponded to a relative risk of 0.56, in favor 
of AeroFa ct treatment.  
2.2.4 Summary of Pharmacokinetic Results  
Pharmacokinetic studies are not applicable.  
2.2.5  Summary of Known and Potential Risks  of Aerosolized Surfactant  Administration  
Experimental use  of  inhaled surfactant is reported in the clinical literature and  this use is expanding 
(Pillow and Minocchieri 2012, Minocchieri, Knoch et al. 2013, Minocchieri, Berry et al. 2018). 
Current publications indicate feasibility and safety of inhaled surfactant for managing preterm 
infants at risk for worsening RDS. SF- RI 1 was shown to have a significant effect on oxygenation, 
and none reported treatment -related AEs  (Jorch, et al, 1997) .  As suggested, aerosolized surfactant 
is expected to augment current nCPAP therapy (Pillow and Minocchieri  2012, Soll, Edwards et al. 
2013, Carlo 2014, Polin, Carlo et al. 2014) by delivering an effective surfactant dose, while minimizing the negative impacts of the current treatments for  RDS.  
 The completed Phase 2a AeroFact
TM study of inhaled SF- RI 1surfactant with nCPAP also showed 
no treatment -related AEs and appears safe and well tolerated.  
 
2.2.6 Dosing Rationale for AeroFact  
Marketed single doses of instilled Alveofact are 54 to 108 mg/kg.  AeroFact  dose selection 
was based on 50% delivery device efficiency from a nominal dose of 108 mg/kg and 216 
mg/kg and additional approximetly 50% of the inhaled dose  being deliver ed to lungs vs. the 
nasal passages .  The maximal feasible dose determined in toxicology studies was 1,223 
mg/kg/day .   
This supports clinical dosing of up to a nominal dose of 864 mg/kg/day or 432 mg/kg/day 
(i.e. up to 4 doses in 96 hours after birth).

2.2.7.1  Risks to Subjects  
The Sponsor has conducted risk analysis and the following clinical harms with overall high 
unmitigated risk have been identified:  
• Hypoventilation, bradypnea,  hypoxemia 
• Progression of  RDS  (in the event of under -dosing) 
• Skin irritation  
• Pneumothorax, volutrauma 
These clinical risks will be properly controlled and/or mitigated relative to the device design e.g. 
implementation of alarms, verification testing or labeling (instructions, warnings and cautions) prior to clinical trials on infants.  
Furthermore, the drug delivery system will be tested for its safety following ISO and IEC 
standards for materials, biological and electrical safety, and electromagnetic compatibility.  
The toxicology program in two species of newborn animals did not identify any risks with 
the dose or the route of administration.  
 
The most common side effects reported when premature infants are given surfactant through the 
ETT or cannula  are:  
• decreases in oxygen saturation (SpO
2) 
• plugging of breathing tube  
• decreases in heart rate, reflux of surfactant into the breathing tube  
• the need for extra mechanical breaths to be g iven from the breathing machine   
These events are generally brief and not associated with serious complications or death.  
Risks of aerosolized surfactant are unknown.  However , due to the small aerosol size and gra dual 
nature of the liquid aerosol administration, they  are expected to be less than those associated with 
administration through an ETT/or cannula .  The surfactant will be given by skilled caregivers  in the 
NICU who can respond to all of these potential si de effects  should they occur .Risks of using the 
AeroFact  drug delivery system are detailed in the   Investigator’s Brochure . 
2.2.7.2  Benefits to Subjects  
There is no guarantee that the infant will receive direct benefit from his/her participation in this 
study.  Infants will ha ve a 66% chance of receiving study drug.  The benefits of being in this study 
may be the possibi lity that administering AeroFact  may improve lung function and decrease the 
need for increases in respiratory support.    Participation may provide information that may benefit 
other premature babies by helping to determ ine the safety and efficacy of  aerosolized surfactant.

4 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN  
The partially -blind, randomized, parallel -group, dose -ranging study is di vided into 2 Parts.  Part I 
includes birth through hospital discharge  or 40 weeks  PMA and Part II discharge through 12 months 
corrected age  (Follow Up).   
4.1 Part I  
Part I is to determine the optimal dose of AeroFact  compared to nCPAP or nIMV  alone in reducing 
the incidence of intubation/cannulation and bolus  surfactant instillation in the first 7 days after birth .  
261 preterm infants who are at risk of worsening Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) , will be 
enrolled .  The AeroFact  dose and dosing strategy determined in this study will be used in a Phase 
3 definitive trial.  Preterm infants who require nCPAP (either by bubble CPAP or machine CPAP) 
or nIMV, and meet  all inclusion and no exclusion criteria, will be enrolled into the study.  
In the delivery room, infants will be stabilized on nCPAP/nIMV  per site clinical guidelines. Once 
the infant has been stabilized, eligibility determined, and parental consent obtained, the infant will 
be block randomized in a 1:1:1 partially- blind fashion to receive one of two doses of AeroFact 
(Active) or Control. The randomization will be stratified by site and two gestational age groups (26  
0/7 to 28  6/7 and 29  0/7 to 31 6/ 7 weeks). Patients who meet all inclusion , no exclusion criteria and 
are randomized to receive Active dose, will have the assigned treatment administered within first twenty-four hours after birth.  Patients who are assigned to the Control group will continue to 
receive nCPAP/nIMV .  If twins or triplets are enrolled, only the first sibling will be randomized 
Aerogen Pharma   Protocol Number APC -AF-CLN -002 
 
Confidential: APC-AF-CLN -002 Amendment 8- 09 Mar2022 25 and subsequent siblings will receive the same treatment assignment .  The Neonatal Intensive Care 
Unit (NICU) staff, the Principal Investigator (PI), the infant’s family , and the sponsor  will be 
blinded to AeroFact  treatment allocation.   
The study treatment allocation will be designated as either Active or Control.  The Neonatal 
Intensive Care Unit (NICU) staff, the Principal Investig ator (PI), the infant’s family, and sponsor 
will be blinded to Active treatment dose allocation.  Randomization will be a two -step process.  
Step 1: a designated member of the study staff will obtain a randomization envelope for the 
appropriate gestational  age group, which will randomize the infant to either the Active or Control 
group.  Step 2: active envelopes will be forwarded to the unblinded pharmacist or designee, where the active envelope will be opened and the Low or High dose group (108 mg/kg or 216 mg/kg)  will 
be determined.  Active drug dose will be calculated and dispensed according to the pharmacy 
manual instructions.   
Active drug will be reconstituted according to the AeroFact package insert  instructions or the  
pharmacy/respiratory therapy ma nual.  Active study drug doses distributed by the pharmacy or 
designee will be labelled with patient ID .  Parameters required to set up the AeroFact  delivery 
system to administer the proper study treatment regimen (patient weight and mg/kg) will be 
program med into the controller by the unblinded member of the study staff.  For active drug doses, 
an unblinded study member will set up the AeroFact  delivery system. The AeroFact  system will be 
primed and set to deliver the appropriate dose.  If the infant is randomized to Control, the infant 
will continue to receive nCPAP /nIMV .  
While preparing the set -up for the AeroFact system,  a privacy screen will be placed around the 
delivery system to ensure the blind is maintained.  Once the system is set up, the privacy screen will be moved aside to allow access to the infant and controller.   Prior to aerosol administration, 
infant will be  transitioned from their standard CPAP/nIMV to the AeroFact  interface.   
Administration of AeroFact  will be managed by the unblinded staff member .  When adjustment of 
the AeroFact  system is required (drug vial change, alarms, etc.), a privacy screen should be utilized 
to mask the treatment allocation.  
Oxygenation, ventilation parameters, and nasal congestion/aspiration will be monitored every 15 minutes for the duration of dosing or a minimum of two hours after the start of dosing by a blinded 
study or staff  member. Dosing tolerance will be evaluated at 4 and  24 hours after the start of each 
AeroFact dose.  AeroFact aerosol delivery will be stopped at the time of dose completion, but AeroFact tubing/nebulizer and vial will remain in place for a minimum of 2 h ours. The AeroFact 
delivery system will be removed from the patient’s bedside after dosing is completed or 2 hours  
have elapsed (whichever is longer) and patient may be transitioned back to their standard nCPAP 
circuit.  A new drug delivery circuit must be  used for each subsequent dose administered.  
Infants receiving active drug will continue on nCPAP/nIMV after dose completion.  If 
oxygenation and ventilation requirements increase within 96 hours  after birth, AeroFact 
administration may be repeated up to three times for a total of 4 doses over the first 96 hours  after 
birth.  Re -dosing of AeroFact (same randomized group) will  be allowed  if the RSS to maintain 
SpO
2 between 90 and 95%  is 1.5 to 2.39 and at least two hours have elapsed since t he start of the  
previous dose :   
• If FiO2 > 0.23, re -dosing will occur.  
• If FiO2 ≤  0.23, re -dosing is at the discretion of the investigator.   
Aerogen Pharma   Protocol Number APC -AF-CLN -002 
 
Confidential: APC-AF-CLN -002 Amendment 8- 09 Mar2022 26 SpO2 between 90- 95% must be used to meet study eligibility through 96 hours for all study groups 
(Active/Control).   Site-specific SpO2 clinical guidelines may be used after 96 hours.  Each site 
must use these guidelines uniformly across treatment groups.  All infants random ized will be 
clinically managed until the criteria for treatment escalation have been met.  If at any time the 
criteria for treatment escalation are met in any of the three treatment arms, intubation and/or bolus 
instillation of surfactant may be administered per site’s standard of care.  Oxygenation, ventilation 
parameters , nasal congestion/aspiration and dosing tolerance will be collected for each bolus 
instillation of surfactant . 
Criteria for treatment escalation for  AeroFact or nCPAP/nIMV only therapy includes any of the 
following: 
1. Respiratory Symptom Severity (RSS) ≥ 2.4 
2. Partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide ( PCO 2) > 65 mg Hg and/or pH < 7.20  
3. Base deficit > 10 mEq/L, on two blood gases 4 hours apart  
4. nCPAP > 8 cm  
5. Three severe apneas with bradycardia within six hours requiring escalation of support  
6. Infant’s work of breathing has increased warranting escalating therapy, but infant does not meet 
RSS or other criteria above.   
Data on all enrolled i nfants will be assessed through 40 weeks PMA or discharge from the NICU.  
Information to include: m aternal /infant delivery , resuscitation history, oxygenation/ventilation 
parameters, concomitant medications of interest, and safety .  O xygenation and ventilation 
mode/ parameters routinely monitored q 8 hours through Day 7, daily days 8 through 28, and  daily 
at weeks 35  to 37  and 39 to 40 PMA/discharge. If an infant is discharged from the NICU prior to 
36 and/or 40 weeks , a study member will call the family to verify the respiratory support  status.  
 Co-morbidities of prematurity ( e.g.: pneumothorax, IVH, PDA, NEC, sepsis , etc.) and adverse 
events (treatment -related or otherwise) will be collected to 40 weeks PMA/Discharge.

the name Alveofact  in Germany and 25 other European and non- European countries.  It is 
manufactured by Lyomark Pharma GmbH  and has been analyzed and released according to the  
approved specifications.  The AeroFact  drug delivery system consists of reusable and single- patient 
components and is  manufactured by Aerogen Limited in Ireland.  
Aerogen Pharma   Protocol Number APC -AF-CLN -002 
 
Confidential: APC-AF-CLN -002 Amendment 8- 09 Mar2022 30 The clinical label will identify both the study medication and drug delivery system components  by 
protocol number, name, lot number, Sponsor, storage conditions, and indicate that it is limited to 
investigational use only . 
6.2  Storage Condition s 
Both the vials of lyophilized SF -RI 1 a nd pre -filled sterile syringe containing 0.45% saline should 
not be stored above 30oC (86oF) and should not be allowed to freeze.  If unavoidable, transient 
excursions up to 40oC are permissible as long as reconstitution has not occurred.  Once the drug 
product has been reconstituted with the 0.45% saline, the resulting suspension can be stored up to 
4 hours at 2- 8°C or room temperature.   In such cases, the vial should be inverted gently 5 times  
before use.  Study medication will be stored in a secure, controlled- access location at the study sites .    
The storage conditions of the re -usable controller and the single -patient , single use disposable, drug 
delivery circuit and respiration  sensor are :  Temperature -20 to +60°C .  In addition, the reusable 
controller and stand with basket should be stored in an area so that they may be charged when not in use.  
6.3  Treatment s Administered  
6.3.1 Part I  
Enrolled infants randomized to one of the two active drug treatments will receive nominal doses of 
108 mg/kg or 216 mg/kg aerosolized SF -RI 1 by a dedicated drug delivery system while on 
nCPAP/nIMV.  A maxi mum of four doses over 96 hours  will be permitted.  Re -dosing will be 
allowed  if the RSS to maintain SpO
2 between 90% and 95%  is 1.5 to 2.39 and at least 2  hours have 
elapsed since the start  of the previous dose : 
• If FiO2 > 0.23, re -dosing will occur.  
• If FiO2 ≤  0.23, re -dosing is at the discretion of the investigator.   
Infants enrolled into the control arm will receive either nCPAP  or nIMV alone.   SpO2 between 90-
95% must be used to meet study eligibility through 96 hours for all study groups (Active/Control).   
Site-specific SpO2 clinical guidelines may be used after 96 hours.  Each site must use these 
guidelines uniformly across treatment groups.  
6.3.2 Part II – Follow- Up 
There is no active treatment in Part II of this study. Parents will be asked to complete a telephone 
questionnaire at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months corrected age.   This questionnaire will asses s the home 
environment, respiratory support, medical history, modified  GMFS  and respiratory resource 
utilization at each time period.

chlorobutyl rubber (4432/50) gray plunger stopper and a synthetic gray polyisoprene tip cap 
(7028/55). The second, manufactured by S.C. Rompharm Company S.R.L, Ilfov County, 
Romania, is a luer -lock format with a gray bromobutyl rubber (FM 257/2) plunger stopper, and a 
synthetic gray isoprene -bromobutyl blend tip cap (7025/65).  
6.4.2 Study Medication Preparation  
There are two ways to prepare the SF- RI 1 suspension, either with a vial -adapter or with a cannula.  
Please refer to the package insert, or the AeroFact  Pharmacy /Respiratory Therapy  Manual for 
reconstitution of the drug product.  
6.4.3 Study Medication Administration  
The study drug in the AeroFact , SF-RI 1, will be administered by a dedicated drug delivery system 
while infants are on nCPAP /nIMV .  Please refer to the Directions for Use (DFU) or the AeroFact  
Pharmacy /Respiratory Therapy Manual s for details on aerosol administration.  
6.5 Drug Delivery System  
6.5.1 Identity of Device 
AeroFact™ is a drug /device combination product consisting of three basic components: (i) drug 
(SF-RI 1 bovine -origin surfactant); (ii) reusable device controller; and (iii) disposable single -
patient , single- use drug delivery circuit and breath  sensor.  This is a stand -alone drug delivery 
system that integrates with a variety  of nCPAP and nI MV devices and  is not designed to be 
connected to the hospital network or the Internet.  The AeroFact™ drug delivery system is designed to administer aerosolized surfactant to the lungs of spontaneously breathing premature infants receiving  nCPAP  or nIMV . 
6.5.2 Aerosol Delivery  System Components  
The AeroFact  drug delivery system  (Figure 1) consists of reusable and single- patient elements:  
6.5.2.1  Reusable  Components  
The controller is a multi- patient, reusable component with flat panel touch- screen display, 
electronics, and software. The controller has three core functions:  
 
• To detect inspiration via a single -patient -use respiration  sensor  
 
• To advance suspension to the nebulizer via an integrated feed mechanism  
 
• To generate aerosol during inspiration at the nCPAP  interface  
 
These functions occur in synchrony with the infant’s inspiratory cycle. The flat panel touch- screen 
utilizes a graphical user interface (GUI) to allow the user to set and monitor delivery parameters, 
alarms, and system diagnostics. Visual and audible alarms are integrated into the controller. The 
Aerogen Pharma   Protocol Number APC -AF-CLN -002 
 
Confidential: APC-AF-CLN -002 Amendment 8- 09 Mar2022 32 Pod communicates the signal from the disposable  single patient use respiration  sensor  to the 
controller and breath synchronizes aerosol generation. 
 
6.5.2.2  Single -patient disposable items : 
Drug Reservoir  (drug vial)  is the reservoir, from which the drug product  (lyophili zed 
SF-RI 1)  is reconstituted into a suspension and dispensed. 
Drug delivery circuit is a disposable, single -patient circuit consisting of:  
• Drug Feed Tubing which includes drug contacting components as follows: (i) luer connector 
(to VVAD) and (ii) tubing conveying drug suspension from the luer to the AF nebulizer.  
• Vented Vial Access Device (VVAD) facilitates access to the drug reservoir and is provided 
to the user in an individual package.  
• AF Nebulizer/nCPAP Interface uses a custom photo defined aperture plate (PDAP) vibrating 
mesh, which is unique in its ability to provide small d roplet sizes and higher output rates. 
This is due to its innovative architecture, which provides up to 20- fold more apertures  with 
smaller  diameters  than  the conventional mesh.   This meets the stringent requirements for 
efficient surfactant delivery to  infants and represents enabling technology for the AeroFact 
platform.   The AF nebulizer/nCPAP interface is designed to dispense aerosol proximal to 
the infant’s airway and connect to conventional nCPAP systems.  
Respiration Sensor is a separate sensor that is placed on the infant’s abdomen w hich s ynchronizes 
drug delivery with the infant’s breathing. 
 
Ancillary non- investigational clinical supplies in clude the following:  
• Nasal Prongs  connect to the end of the drug delivery circuit and are provided in a variety of 
sizes to accommodate different size infants  
• Knit cap/bonnet ( F&P™ not shown) to secure the nasal prongs and nebulizer to the infant  
• Cavilon™ no sting barrier film  to protect the integrity of the skin prior to applying the breath 
sensor  
• Kind ™ Removal silicone tape  to be placed over the breath sensor  which secures it to the 
abdomen without comprising the integrity  of the skin 
• Study Medication Lock box 
• Bedsheet clip

6.5.3 Device Supply  
Prior to AeroFact  dosing, the drug delivery system will be brought to the bedside .  The serial 
numbers for the controller/Pod and disposable drug delivery circuit  will be recorded in the study 
records .  A controller  and P od will be used by more than one patient and will be cleaned between 
each patient  (see DFU) .  A new drug delivery circuit is required for each dose of AeroFact  given 
and will never be re -used. 
Used and unused disposable devices will be inventoried and returned to the Sponsor or Sponsor’s 
designee.   Drug Delivery Systems and their components  will be returned to the Sponsor or 
Sponsor’s designee  at the conclusion of Part I .  
6.5.4 Device Replacement  
One device (controller, drug delivery circuit and associated components) is expected to perform 
throughout the duration of dose.  If the controller or the drug delivery circuit are not functioning 
optimally for any reason, instructions for trouble -shooting provided in the device instruction 
manual should be followed by the trained unblinded staff.  If one o r more devices need to be 
 
Aerogen Pharma   Protocol Number APC -AF-CLN -002 
 
Confidential: APC-AF-CLN -002 Amendment 8- 09 Mar2022 34 replaced, the reason should be documented in the patient’s medical record and appropriate study 
records .  Additional devices are provided for this purpose.  The unique serial numbers of the new 
controller and drug delivery circuit will be recorded in the patient’s medical record and study 
records . 
Controllers and drug delivery circuits should be replaced  at any time if th ere is a confirmed or 
suspected malfunction . 
• Device substitution , whether controller or circuit, should be recorded on the appropriate 
page of the study records . 
• Notation must be made if the investigator suspects the device is not performing optimally for any reason.  
If the Device fails, there is no way to restart a partial dose.  
• For any partial dose delivered , note the amount of dose remaining on the controller drug 
delivery screen  (if available)  and record on Unblinded dosing record.   Otherwise estimate 
the amount delivered and record on Unblinded dosing record.   This will count as a one of 
the 4 delivered dose s.   Patient will be eligible for repeat dosing 2 hours after the start of the 
previous dose.  
• Only a maximum of four doses of AeroFact will be delivered.  
For device performance problems  or comp laints, the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s designee should be 
contacted within 48 hours.  Complaints should be submitted to: Complaints@aerogenpharma.com

8.2.1.2   Adverse events  
Adverse events (AE) for this study include the co -morbidities of prematurity listed above or any  
untoward medical occurrence deemed significant by the Principal Investigator.  An AE does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.   An AE may also occur which 
may be related to the medical device that is being tested. The Investigator will be ask ed to determine 
the causal relationship of each AE to the investigational device.  This includes any event that is the 
result of incomplete user manual infor mation or of incorrect use of the medical device.  
8.2.1.3   Pre-existing Co-morbidities  of Prematurity  
A pre -existing condition or symptom /co-morbidity of prematurity prior to dosing is one that is 
present at the start of the study and is reported as part of the patient ’s medical history.  A pre -
existing condition or symptom should be reported as an AE  only if its frequency, intensity or 
character worsens during study treatment.  
Aerogen Pharma   Protocol Number APC -AF-CLN -002 
 
Confidential: APC-AF-CLN -002 Amendment 8- 09 Mar2022 39 All co-morbidities/AEs  that occur from randomization through the discharge or 40 weeks  PMA   
must be appropriately documented in the patient ’s medical chart and on the CRFs.  When known, 
investigators should report syndromes rather than list symptoms  associated with the syndrome .  
AEs occurring in Part I should be followed until:  
• resolution/ stable sequelae; or  
• the Investigator determines that it is no longer clinically signi ficant; or   
• the study patient  is discharged .  
If no follow -up is provided, the Investigator must provide a written justification.  
8.2.2 Grading of Adverse Events  
The severity of each AE  will be categorized using the following criteria:  
• Grade 1 (Mild) :  usually transient; requires no special treatment  
• Grade 2 (Moderate):  usually ameliorated by simple therapeutic measures 
• Grade 3 (Severe) :  may require  systemic drug the rapy or other medical treatment  
8.2.3 Relationship to Study Medication /Study Device /Study Procedure  
The Investigator must assess the relationship of each reported AE .  The Investigator must assess  
the relationship of the AE  to the study medication  using the following scale:  
• Unrelated: The A E is de finitely not or unlikely to be associated with study 
medication/study device/study procedure and is judged due to causes other than the study 
medication/study device/study procedure.  
• Related:   The AE is possibly or probably related with study medication/study device/study 
procedure.  
8.2.4 AE/Co -Morbidi ties of Prematurity Action Taken  
Any action taken in response to AE/co -morbidities of prematurity will be recorded as follows:  
• Study Medication 
o Dose not changed 
o Drug interrupted  
o Dosing stopped 
• Study Device /Procedure 
o None 
o Remove /Replace Controller 
o Remove/Replace Circuit

Confidential: APC-AF-CLN -002 Amendment 8- 09 Mar2022 40 8.2.5 AE/Co -Morbidities of Prematurity Outcomes  
The following terms and definitions are used in assessing the final outcome of an AE/Co-
Morbidities of Prematurity:  
• Recovered/Resolved  - The participant has fully recovered, or by medical or surgical 
treatment , the condition has returned to the level obse rved at the first trial- related activity 
after the participant signed the informed consent.  
• Recovering /Resolving  - The condition is improving, and the participant is expected to 
recover from the event.  
• Recovered/Resolved  with sequelae - The participant has  recovered from the condition, but 
with lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequelae meets an 
SAE criterion, the AE must be reported as an SAE.  
• Not recovered/Not resolved  - The condition of the participant has not improved, and the 
symptoms are unchanged, or the outcome is not known at the time of reporting.  
• Fatal - This term is only applicable if the participant died from a condition related to the 
reported AE. An AE with fatal outcome must be reported as an SAE.  
8.2.6 Serious Adverse Events  (SAEs) , Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), and 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR s) 
8.2.6.1  SAEs  
The Investigator is required to determine if each AE  is a Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ).  A SAE is 
any AE occurring after randomization through discharge from NICU or 40 weeks PMA  and results 
in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death, or  
• Is life -threatening, or  
• Requires in patient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or  
• Results in a persi stent or significant  incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
The Investigator is required to determine the causal relationship of each SAE to the investigational 
device based on the outcomes listed above in the definition of a SAE.   
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require prolongation 
of hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient  and may requ ire medical or surgical intervention to prevent  one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
In the event of death, the cause of death should be recorded as the SAE (death is an outcome, not the AE itself).    
Aerogen Pharma   Protocol Number APC -AF-CLN -002 
 
Confidential: APC-AF-CLN -002 Amendment 8- 09 Mar2022 41 8.2.6.2  TEAEs  
Treatment -emergent adverse event s (TEAE s) will be summar ized up to 7 days after birth and are 
defined as  one of the following occurring from the first dose of AeroFact for the active group or 
from the first bolus instillation of surfactant in the control group:  
• AEs that emerge during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (Baseline), or  
• Reemerge during treatment, having been present at Baseline but stopped prior to treatment, 
or  
• Worsen in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous. 
8.2.6.3  SUSARs  
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction is an AE or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered "unexpected" if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or 
available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.  
8.2.7 Reporting for SAEs    
Part I  
Regardless of causality, an SAE must be followed clinically until resolution or stabilization.   
All SAEs after randomization through discharge from the NICU or 40 weeks PMA must be reported 
to the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s representative within 24  hours of the investigational site’s 
knowledge of the occurrence.  The investigational site will either telephone the report to the Sponsor  
or the Sponsor ’s representative or transmit by email a Serious Adverse Event Report (SAER) to the 
Sponsor or  the Sponsor’s represe ntative.  If the initial report is made via telephone, a completed 
SAER  must be emailed within 24  hours of the site’s knowledge of the event.  Investigational sites 
will be provided with SAER forms.  
The SAER  should be emailed within 24 hours with as much i nformation as available at the time.   
At a minimum the initial report should include: patient number, event, treatment group ( active or 
control) , investigator assessment of causality, and event proxi mity to study drug dosing should be 
reported, if known.  Supplemental information may be transmitted using a follow -up report and 
should not delay the initial report.  
Part II 
Only SAE’s resulting in death will be recorded.  Information on death will be collected and reported 
to Sponsor  within 1 week of  site notification.

Active -High Dose  AeroFact 216 mg/kg (Aerosolized SF -RI 1)  
Control  nCPAP  or nIMV alone  
 
12.2 Description of Study Endpoints  
12.2.1  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  – Part I  
• Proportion of infants requiring intubation/cannulation and bolus  surfactant instillation in the 
first 7 days after birth  
12.2.2  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  – Part I  
• Time to first intubation/cannulation and bolus  surfactant instillation between study 
treatments for first 7 days of life  
• Compare the p roportion of infants across  groups receiving multiple doses of surfactant  
• Number of days on mechanical ventilation from the day of birth  to 40 weeks PMA or 
discharge.   
• Number of days on supplemental oxygen administration from the day of b irth  to 40 weeks 
PMA or discharge  
• Survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 and 40 weeks PMA

Confidential: APC-AF-CLN -002 Amendment 8- 09 Mar2022 48 12.3 Sample Size Determination and Rationale  
Two hundred and sixty- one (261) subjects  (87 in each arm)  will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio in 
order to assure that 246 subjects (82 in each arm) complete the st udy. The randomization will be 
stratified by site, gestational age and dosing group.  
Infants requiring treatment escalation in the AeroFact dose groups is estimated to be 20% and in 
the control group is estimated to be 40%, with an odds ratio of 0.375.  
Under the above assumptions, 82 subjects in each treatment group will be required, to meet the 
Type I error rate of 0.05 and 80% statistical power. To accommodate the potential dropouts, a 5% dropout rate is included in this sample size calculation.  
The sample size is depicted in Figure 12.1 . 
Figure 12-1: Sample Size  
 
 
12.4 Randomization 
Infants will be block randomized in a 1:1:1 partially- blind fashion to receive one of two doses of 
AeroFact (Active) or Control. The randomization will be stratified by site and gestational age.  There 
will be two sets of randomization envelopes, one for each gest ational age group and they will be 
color- coded.  If twins or triplets are enrolled, only the first sibling will be randomized and 
subsequent siblings will receive the same treatment assignment.  
Treatment group will be randomly assigned using a predetermine d randomization schedule created 
by an independent individual who is not on the study team. The randomization schedule will be 
generated using an appropriate block size to help maintain treatment groups of equal size  within 
each age strata. Subjects who do  not complete the study will not be replaced.

Confidential: APC-AF-CLN -002 Amendment 8- 09 Mar2022 49 12.5 Stratification 
The randomization will be stratified by site and gestational age ( 26 0/7 to 28 6/7; and 29 0/ 7 to 3 1 
6/7 weeks . 
 
12.6 Blinding and prevention of Bias  
For the active dose groups, c linical and research staff will remain blinded to dose level being 
administered.  A eroFact drug delivery c ircuit will remain in line  for the duration of dosing or a 
minimum of 2 hours, regardless of dose volume being administered.    
 
Treatment unblinding for investigator site personnel  will occur after the completion of Part II and 
all clinical data have been received, data inconsistencies have been resolved, and the database is locked, except for emergency unblinding  due to safety reasons .  For all o ther study personnel 
(sponsor, vendors, stats, data management, etc.) ,  active dose unblinding will occur after the 
completion of Part I and all clinical data for Part I have been received, data inconsistencies have 
been resolved, and the database of Part I is locked, except for emergency unblinding due to safety 
reasons.  
 The control group for this study  are infants treated with nCPAP or nIMV alone.  
 
12.7 Interim Analysis (IA)  
A blinded interim analysis is planned and will be conducted when approximately 60% of subjects 
have been randomized and completed first 7 days of life or early terminat ion, whichever occurs 
first.  
The main purpose of this interim analysis will be:  
• sample size re-a ssessment to evaluate the final sample size needed to proceed with the study  
based on the control responder rate at interim analysis, and;  
• to evaluate the safety of AeroFact primarily on the frequency of adverse events, nasal 
congestion/aspiration, dosing tolerance events , and serious adverse events  
The results of the interim analysis are to be reviewed by an independent D SMB  who would assess 
the data for both safety and efficacy. The D SMB  responsibilities are further elaborated in the D SMB 
charter. The DSM B will make recommendations to the sponsor  on the sample size adjustment and 
any safety concerns . The details of the interim analysis will be included in the statistical analysis 
plan. 
There will be no statistical penalty or statistical adjustment due to this interim analysis as this is a 
blinded interim analysis with no interim unblinding.  
 
12.8 General Statistical Considerations  
All collected study data will be presented in subject data listings. Statistical analyses will be 
performed using SAS
® for Windows, version 9.4 or later. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum and maximum) will be calculated by treatment group for continuous variables. Frequencies and percentages will be presented by treatment group for categ orical 
variables.

Confidential: APC-AF-CLN -002 Amendment 8- 09 Mar2022 50 12.9 Analysis Populations  
The details of the analysis population to be used for the study are described in the below sections.  
12.9.1  Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population is defined as all randomized subjects. The ITT population will 
be the primary population for the primary, secondary and additional efficacy analysis.  
12.9.2  Per Protocol (PP) Population  
The Per Protocol (PP) population is de fined as all randomized subjects who  were not associated 
with a major protocol violation  that affects patient safety or the integrity of the data . The PP analysis 
of primary, secondary and additional endpoints will be considered supportive.  
12.9.3  Safety Populat ion 
The Safety population is defined as all randomized subjects. This population will be used for the 
analysis of safety parameters.  
12.10 Covariates  
The covariates planned for this study  will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan . 
 
12.11 Adjustment due to Mul tiple Comparisons  
There are two comparisons for the primary endpoint because of the two active dose groups 
compared with a control. Hence, a closed test procedure will be used to protect the type I error rate, 
the order of testing will be:  
1) AeroFact 216  mg/kg (Aerosolized SF -RI 1) vs. Control ( nCPAP  or nIMV alone )  
2) AeroFact 108 mg/kg (Aerosolized SF -RI 1) vs. Control ( nCPAP  or nIMV alone ) 
 Similarly, since there are multiple secondary endpoints a closed test procedure will be used to 
project the Type I error rate. The order of the secondary endpoints will be specified in the statistical 
analysis plan.   
12.12 Statistical Methods  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be developed and approved before the database is locked. 
The SAP will present the detailed statistical methodology to be used in analyzing the efficacy and 
safety data from this trial. All inferential statistical analysis will be based on a two -sided test with 
a Type I error rate of 0.05.  
 
All the efficacy analyses presented here w ill be conducted using both ITT and PP populations. All 
safety analyses will be conducted using the Safety population. All data collected will be summarized according to the variable type.  
12.12.1   Subject Disposition  
The disposition of all subjects who sign an ICF will be provided. The numbers of subjects screened, 
randomized, completed, and discontinued during the study, as well as the reasons for all post -
randomization discontinuations will be summarized by treatment  group. Disposition and reason for 
study discontinuation will also be provided as a by -subject listing.

Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group using 
appropriate descriptive statistics.  
12.12.3   Concomitant Medications/Therapies  of Interest  
Concomitant medications  of interest/therapies will be summarized separately for the Safety 
population. All prior and concomitant medications of interest recorded in the case report form will 
be coded to all matching Anatomic Therapeutic Classification codes using the most recent version 
of WHO Drug. De scriptive summaries by treatment group  will be prepared using the coded term. 
All concomitant medications  of interest/therapies recorded in the case report form will be listed.   
12.13 Efficacy Analyses  
The primary analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be conducted on the ITT population. The PP population analyses of primary and secondary endpoints will be considered 
supportive. 
For the efficacy endpoints the data will be summarized and compared according to the variable type:  
• Continuous data summaries will include:  
o Descriptive summary of number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, and minimum and maximum values.   
o Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) or Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) adjusted for stratification  factors for inferential statistics.  
• Categorical data summaries will include:  
o Frequency counts and percentages  
o Logit model or Generalized  Estimating Equation (GEE) method adjusted for 
stratification factors and clustering of multiple births within a mothe r for inferential 
statistics  
• Time -dependent data: Cox proportional hazards model will be used to analyze time 
dependent data and to depict the time to event data.  
 
12.14   Safety Analyses  
12.14.1   Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using MedDRA. TEAEs will be summarized for subjects who 
received at least one dose of AeroFact for the active group or received bolus instillation for the 
control group. AEs and TEAEs will also be summarized for up to 7 days after birth.  
TEAEs will be summarized by treatment group, System Organ Class, and preferred term. The 
following TEAE summaries will be provided:

be presented by preferred term nested within System Organ Class.  Verbatim description and all 
MedDRA level terms, including the lower level terms, for all AEs will be contained in the data listings of the CSR.  
AEs will be summarized by presenting, for each treatment group, the incidence of AEs.  Although 
a MedDRA term may be repo rted more than once for a patient , that patient  will be counted onl y 
one time in the incidence count for that MedDRA term.  
12.16 The Procedure for Revising the Analysis Plan  
Any changes to the  statistical analysis plan will be formalized and dated in an amen dment and 
documented in the CSR.

In some cases , a potential parent (s) will be approached and given information about the study prior 
to birth of the infant , and  prenatal consent will be obtained.  In others, consent will be obtained 
postnatally. 
As part of administering the informed consent document, the Investigator must explain to the 
parent (s) the nature of the study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, the 
potential risks and benefits involved, and any potential discomfort.  The parent (s) must be informed 
that participation in the study is voluntary and that they  may withdraw their infant from the study 
at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect their infant’s  subsequent medical 
treatment or relationship with the treating p hysician. 
This informed consent should be given by means of a standard written statement, written in non-technical language.  The parent (s) should understand the statement before signing and dating it and 
will be given a copy of the signed document.  The parent (s) will be asked to sign an informed 
consent prior to any study- specific procedures being performed.  No infant  can enter the study 
before informed consent has been obtained.  
Due to the COVID- 19 pandemic, informed consent may be conducted by phone or  video-
conference, rather than in -person. Discussion of study and consent may  be done remotely. Consents 
may be given to parent to sign or sent via email for electronic signature.  If remote process of 
consent and signatures are used, they must be witnessed using process approved by site IRB.  
An unsigned copy of an IRB/IEC and Sponsor -approved written informed consent must be prepared 
in accordance with ICH E 6, Section 4, and all applicable local regulations, i.e., Federal Regulations, Title 21, CFR Part 50, and provided to the Sponsor.  The parent (s) must sign an 
approved informed consent prior to study participation.  The form must be signed and dated by the appropriate parties.  The ori ginal signed ICF for each infant will be verified by the Sponsor and 
kept in the study center’s investigational site files.  
The parent (s) should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available  that 
may be relevant to the ir willingness to continue participation of their child in the trial.  The 
communica tion of this information should be documented.  
13.2  Administrative Procedures  
13.2.1  Changes to the Protocol  
There are to be no changes to the protocol without written approval from the Sponsor.  Protocols 
will be followed as written.  
Any change to the protocol requires a written protocol amendment or administrative change that 
must be approved by the Sponsor before implementation.  Amendments specificall y affecting the 
safety of patients , the scope of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the study require 
additional approval by the applicable IRBs/IECs of all investigational sites and, by the FDA.  These 
requirements should in no way prevent any immediate action from being taken by the Investigator , 
or by the Sponsor, in the interest of pre serving the safety of all patients  included in the study.  If an 
immediate change to the protocol is felt to be necessary  by the Investigator for safety reasons, the 
Aerogen Pharma   Protocol Number APC -AF-CLN -002 
 
Confidential: APC-AF-CLN -002 Amendment 8- 09 Mar2022 55 Sponsor’s Medical Monitor must be notified promptly and the IRB/IEC for the site must be 
informed as soon as possible.  
Changes affecting only administrative aspects of the study do not require formal protocol 
amendments or IRB/IEC approval, but the IRB/IEC must be kept informed of such changes.  In 
these cases, the Sponsor will send a letter to th e site for forwarding on to the IRB/IEC detailing 
such changes.  
13.2.2  Adherence to the Protocol  
The Investigator will conduct the study in strict accordance with the protocol (refer to ICH E6, 
Section 4.5).   Any requests for a planned deviation from the protocol  must be discussed with

13.2.3  Monitoring Procedures  
The Sponsor  or Sponsor ’s representative will maintain contact with the Investigator and designated 
staff by telephone, letter, and/or email between study visits.  Monitoring visits (blinded and 
unblinded) may be done either remotely or by visits to each investigational site and  conducted by a 
Sponsor representative or CRA .  The Investigator will allow the CRA to inspect the clinical and 
pharmacy facilities to assure compliance with GCPs and local regulatory requirements.  The CRF s 
and patient ’s corresponding original medical records (source documents) are to be fully available 
for review by the Sponsor’s representatives at regular intervals.  These review s verify adherence to 
study protocol and data accuracy in accordance with federal regulations and local regulations.  All 
records at the investigational site are subject  to inspection by the FDA.  
In accordance with ICH E6, Section 6.10, source documents include, but are not limited to the following: 
• Clinic, office, hospital charts . 
• Copies or transcribed health care provider notes which have been certified for accuracy after production.

their own source . 
13.2.4  Recording of Data  
In order to provide the Sponsor with accurate, complete, and legible case reports, the following 
criteria are to be maintained.  The Investigator will enter the  information required by the protocol 
onto the CRFs in accordance with the CRF Completion Guidelines provided by the Sponsor, report 
the CRFs to the Sponsor, and preserve the copy of the CRFs after the Investigator signs to the CRFs.  
13.2.5  Quality Assurance and Quality Control  
To ensure compliance with ICH GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, the sponsor (or a designated third party), may conduct a quality assurance audit of the study site. Regulatory agencies 
may also conduct a regulatory inspection of this study. Such audits/inspections can occur at any 
time during or after completion of the study. If an audit or inspection occurs, the Investigator and 
institution agree to notify the sponsor as soon as possible following awareness of an impending 
regulatory inspection. The Investigator and Institution agree to allow the auditor/inspector direct 
access to all relevant documents and allocate his/her time and the time of his/her staff to the 
auditor/inspector to discuss findings and any relevant issues.  
The sponsor (or its designee) will perform the quality assurance and quality control activities of this 
study; however, responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of the study data 
presented to the sponsor lies with the Investigator (and delegate(s)) generating the data.   
Prior to the study initiation, the sponsor (or its designee) will explain the protocol, Investigator’s 
Brochure, and CRF to the Investigator and clinical facility staff involved in this study. In addition, 
the assigned study monitor will be available to explain applicable regulations and to answer any questions regarding the conduct of the study.

The circumstances of completion or termination of the study notwithstanding, the Investigator has 
the res ponsibility to retain all study documents, including but not limited to the protocol, copies of 
CRFs, Investigator's Brochure, regulatory agency registration documents, e.g. , FDA 1572 form, 
ICFs, and IRB/IEC correspondence.  In addition, the Sponsor will send a list of  treatment codes by 
study patient  to the Investigator after the clinical database for this study has been secured  after the 
completion of Part II .  The investigational site should retain the records and reports required by this 
part for 2 years after a marketing application is approved for the drug; or, if an application is not approved for the drug, until 2 years after shipment and delivery of the drug for investigational use is discontinued and FDA has been so notified, or as required by their site IRB.  
It is requested that at the completion of the required retention period, or should the Investigator 
retire or relocate, the Investigator contact s the Sponsor, allowing the Sponsor the option of 
permanently retaining the study records.

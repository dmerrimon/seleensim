4.0   OBJECTIVE  
This enrollment protocol is an effort to evaluate the correlation between serum and 
urine values  of the bone marker of interest to  help establish accuracy of serum 
values  compared to urine.  
 
Data collected in this clinical study may also be used for scientific publication 
purposes, autho red by the study investigators o r by scientists coll aborating with 
the study investigator(s), for the advancement of scientific knowledge on bone 
diseases.   
5.0   OVERVIEW    
 Background  
Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic disorder in the United States and it 
is estimated that approximately 19% of women and 4% of men over the age 50 
years have underlying disease. This number is expected to continue to rise. A 
silent illness  at first , once presenting with fractures, it can lead to increased 
morbidity, mortality, and decrease d quality of life. It carr ies large financial and 
societal burdens. Direct annual medical costs are estimated to be approximately 
17 to 20 billion dollars in the United States alone [1]. Therefore, i t is important to 
accurately identify those at high risk.   
 
The present gold standa rd to diagnose osteoporosis is the Dual -energy X -ray 
absorptiometry (DEXA scan) [2] with a diagnosis based on a T -score of -2.5 SD or 
below in those without history of fragility fracture. However, many individuals 
fracture despite having normal or only mil dly reduced scores. There are also 
several barriers within the DEXA technology including accessibility, cost, accurate 
reference ranges for age and demographic groups that result in missing large 
groups of people at risk for osteoporosis. The Fracture Risk  Assessment Tool 
(FRAX score) is one tool that identifies those at higher risk of fracture that may 
benefit from therapy [3]. It was designed and released in 2008 and has been a 
great asset in clinical practice in stratifying risk and guiding management of  
osteopenic  patients. However, FRAX may miss many individuals that may benefit 
from therapy due to its limited inclusion criteria [4].  
   
Bone markers have been shown to predict fracture risk in postmenopausal women 
independent of bone mineral density  and may help identify high risk 
individuals . Amino -terminal cross -linking telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX) 
reflects osteoclastic bone resorption. NTX can be measured in both the serum and 
in urine.  
 
The accuracy of the serum NTX is unclear. It may be les s sensitive than urine NTX 
in detecting bone density changes [5]. The urine NTX overcomes circadian rhythm 
changes to bone density and is less sensitive to dietary collagen intake [6,7]. At 
present, urine markers need to be checked as a second void of the day which may 
be cumbersome for patients.  Serum levels drawn with other bone labs would be 
Title: A comparison of Serum and Urine Bone Marker     
IRB #    Revision:  01 Page 7 of 13 
easier to obtain than second void urine collections. We would like to evaluate the 
correlation between serum and urine NTX in patients with osteopenia with no prior 
history of osteoporotic treatment. If the urine and serum markers are equivalent 
methods, serum levels would be preferred to identify high risk patients at risk of 
disease due to ease of collection.    
 Study Site 
This is a prospective blood and urine collec tion study under the supe rvision of 
clinical researchers. Subjects will be enrolled at the CCF  
 Overall Study Design  
This is a prospective specimen collection cohort study to evaluate the correlation 
between serum and urine values of the bone marker of interest, and their 
association with baseline DEXA scan measures and fracture risk within 6 months.   
 
Study samples will be obtained longitudinally . One collection of both serum and 
urine collection will be obtained. The urine will be collected as second v oid of day 
and at the same time the blood collection is drawn. Study will continue for a period 
or 1 year, with plan to enroll around 40 subjects.   
 Subject Enrollment  
Subjects will be enrolled prospectively, under Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
approval and patient informed consent. Enrollment will include patients diagnosed 
with osteopenia on DEXA scan who have not been on any medical therapy in the 
past. Recruitment  will occur via phone, mail, virtual or in-office visit. Subjects will 
be consented in an office visit. Subjects will be identified either during an in -office 
visit, referral by colleague or via ICD code EPIC inquiry.

 Sample Handling  
Will be handled per CCF laboratory standards  
 
5.8.1  Stability  
The urine and serum sample can be kept at ambient temperature for 1 day, 
if refrigerated for 7 days and if frozen for 14 days  
 
 Standard of Car e Assessments  
The study will collect the results of any procedures perf ormed as per standard of 
care.  
 
 Statistical Analyses  
Pearson or Spearman correlations will be used to measure the association 
between serum and urine markers. Similar correlation measures will be used to 
measure associations with DEXA scan results, and Comparisons of the 
correlations were performed using the cocor package in R software (version 4.0; 
Title: A comparison of Serum and Urine Bone Marker     
IRB #    Revision:  01 Page 10 of 13 
Vienna, Austria) using the methods by Meng, Rosenthal, and Rubin (1992)  to 
compare the correlations and calculate 95% confidence intervals for their 
difference.   As an exploratory analysis, associations between serum and urine 
levels with fracture risk will be evaluated using two -sample t -tests and, if feasible, 
ROC analyses will be used to compare the predictive ability of each marker.   If the 
number of fractures is small, this analysis will not be performed.   If the follow -up 
through 6 months cannot be measured consistently across patients, alternate 
methods including time t o event analysis may be used to account for differential 
follow -up. 
 
 Sample Size Justification  
The primary sample size calculation was based on the ability to detect a moderate 
correlation (r=0.5) between serum and urine levels.   With 40 patients, there will be 
90% power to detect moderate correlations based on a two -sided test of the 
Fisher’s Z test of the Pearson correlation  (Image 1) .  Power calculations were 
performed using SAS software (version 9.4; Cary, NC). (8)   
 
6.0   DATA MANAGEMENT  
The Principal Investigator (PI) is responsible for ensuring that all data are 
submitted in a timely fashion.  

Title: A comparison of Serum and Urine Bone Marker     
IRB #    Revision:  01 Page 11 of 13 
 Data Management  
We will use RedCap database, only CCF MRN as identifier, assign serial number 
to each unique patient and store data on a Clevelan d Clinic Shared Drive which 
will be accessed on workstations requiring login credentials. Once data are 
collected, we will de -identify the rows and use only serial numbers.  
 Data Clarification  
During the conduct of the study, if a question regarding the da ta arises, the 
Monitor and/or Delegate will work with the site to resolve the issue. All 
communications will be documented in a query via the electronic database.  
7.0   ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Unanticipated Non -Serious Adverse Event Reporting:  
Unanticipated n on-serious adverse events assessed by the PI as being either 
caused by, or related to, the study procedures, will also be reported using the 
Adverse Event Report form.   
 
The following adverse events are anticipated as a result of the blood collection 
required per the study procedures:  pain, bruising, bleeding or infection at the site 
where the blood was collected from the subject.  Fainting may also occur as a 
result of blood collection. Because these events are anticipated, they do NOT need 
to be reported  using the Adverse Event Report form as long as they are not 
assessed as serious . If assessed as serious, then they need to be reported.  
 Date of Awareness  
A test site becomes aware of an MDR reportable event when medical personnel 
who are employed by or otherwise formally affiliated with the facility acquire 
information that reasonably suggests that a reportable event has occurred.  
Medical personnel include persons who are licensed, registered, or certified to 
administer healthcare, who have received a d iploma or a degree in a professional 
or scientific discipline, or who are responsible for receiving medical complaints or 
adverse event reports or who supervise such persons.  
 
8.0 ADMINISTRATION

with written documentation demonstrating that this study has been approved by 
the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC).  A copy

OVERALL RATIONALE FOR PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 03:
 
 
   
 
 
 On 07-Apr-2022, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) informed sites 
and the steering committee of the d ecision to stop new enrollment to the CA2097FL study. The 
study committee was supportive of the decision. Participants who had signed study consent prior to this decision and were undergoing screen ing were permitted to be randomized to study 
treatment. The decision to stop new enrollment wa s not based on any safety signal or review of 
any efficacy data. There has been no change in the understanding of the safety profile of nivolumab 
in combination with paclitaxel,  cyclophosphamide, epirubicin/doxorubicin, and endocrine therapy.
Key changes in Protocol Amendment 03 include the following:
•Details of study enrollment closure with p rovision for e nrolled participants on treatment to
continue in the study.
•The primary endpoint of the trial was updated to focus solely on pathological complete
response (pCR) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Event-free survival (EFS) was moved
from primary to exploratory endpoint and w ill be evalu ated up to long-term follow-up at 12
months (± 2 months) post-Surgery visit. pCR in the programmed d eath-ligand 1-positive
(PD-L1+) population will be evaluated as a secondary endpoint. The study will remain blinded
through the neoadjuvant treatment and surgery phases and w ill transition to open label when
participants enter into adjuvant treatment.
•Removal of nivolumab placebo infusion at Adjuvant phase for participants in Arm B.
•Removal of pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity samples collection at Ad juvant phase for
participants in Arm B.
•The study will follow participants until completion of safety follow-up visits 1 and 2 and a
single long-term follow-up visit at approximately 12 months (± 2 months) post-surgery.
Subsequent long-term follow-up visits have been removed.
•The study objectives, endpoints, and statistical analysis have been updated and clarified.
Additional revisions, including to the Protocol Synopsis, have been mad e to align the protocol 
amendment with respect to these changes.
Other clarifications and editorial updates  were made throughout the protocol to im prove clarity 
and readability and to keep consistency throughout the document.
Changes instituted in Protocol Amendment 03 should override any existing protocol requirements
in the event of any apparent discrepancies.

SUMMARY OF KEY CHANGES FOR PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 03
Section Number & Title Description of Change Brief Rationale
Table 2-1 : Screening Procedural 
Outline ( CA2097FL)The screening procedures are not 
applicable as of Protocol 
Amendment 03 as the study has been closed to enrollment. This is clarified in footnote “a” as well.Because the study is unlikely to 
complete enrollment in a reasonable 
timeframe and may no longer be able to achieve the scientific objectives of the trial, BMS decided to stop new enrollment to the CA2097FL study.

participants with remaining breast 
tissue post-surgery” row was removed.Mammogram or breast MRI
assessment will not be performed 
before 1 year post-surgery.
Table 2-5: Follow-up Procedural 
Outline ( CA2097FL)In the row for Mammogram or breast MRI, the notes were updated 
to add that for participants that already performed a mammogram or breast MRI at 1-year post-surgery, a second examination is not required.Further clarify mammogram or breast 
MRI at 1 year post-surgery.

1 SYNOPSIS
Protocol Title: A Randomized, Multicenter, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Phase 3 Study of 
Nivolumab Versus Placebo in Combination Wit h Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Adjuvant 
Endocrine Therapy in Patients With High-risk, Estrogen Receptor-Positive (ER+), Human 
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2- Negative (HER2-) Primary Breast Cancer
Short Title:
Nivolumab or Placebo with Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy in ER+, 
HER2- Breast Cancer
Study Phase: 3
Rationale:Neoadjuvant therapy is used increasingly in patients with primary breast cancer (BC) to improve 
the likelihood of local tumor control, assess the treatment sensitivity of the disease in vivo, and increase the potential for curable disease by targeting the micrometastatic disease burden. Robust 
individual patient-level data meta-analyses from well-c onducted clinical trials  suggest that 
achieving a pathological complete response (pCR) i s positively associated with improvement in 
event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival ( OS); these associations are more robust within 
populations with high-risk BC subtypes. Further, use of the neoadjuvant setting as a research platform permits rapid assessment of drug efficacy and may expedite clinical development of new 
agents in this setting. Agents that positively and substantially impact pCR rates may have a 
reasonable expectation of meaningful improvement in EFS.
Current neoadjuvant standard of care (SOC), consisting of anthracycline-taxane-based 
chemotherapy, is effective and tolerable among most patients with pr imary BC. Chemotherapy is 
effective in high-risk, primary estrogen receptor-pos itive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2-negative (HER2-) disease and pCR rates  range from 7-16%, which are lower than those 
achieved in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HE R2+) and triple-negative breast 
cancer (TNBC) subtypes through chemotherapy with or without human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2) blockade, respectively (30-50%). In addition, SOC clinical management of 
patients with ER+ BC also includes endocrine therapy (ET) for up to a 10-year period. In the 
setting of a high-risk disease population receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, ET is administered in the adjuvant setting, with the 2 treatment modalities not being administered concomitantly.
Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) pathway inhibition has demonstrated clinical activity across 
multiple tumor types, including BC. An accu mulating body of preclinical and clinical data supports 
the combination of anti-PD-1 agents and chemotherapy to improve clinical outcomes in early and advanced settings across BC subtypes; such data  culminated recently in the first approval of a 
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor, atezolizumab, coupled with single-agent chemotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed, programmed death-ligand 1-positive (PD-L1+; 
assessed in the immune-cell component of the disease) metastatic TNBC. Preliminary clinical data 
from a Phase 2 adaptive-design neoadjuvant trial ( I-SPY2) in participants with HER2- BC (ER+, 
HER2-, and TNBC cohorts) assessed an anti-PD-1 agent added to standard paclitaxel

chemotherapy and demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in pCR relative to historical 
controls. These and other early clinical  trials support  currently ongoing Phase 3 
neoadjuvant-adjuvant trials that are evaluating anti-PD-1 agents in the HER2- population.
 
 
  
 
 
 
On 07-Apr-2022, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) 
informed sites and the steeri ng committee to stop new enrollment into the CA2097FL study. The 
study steering committee was suppor tive of the decision. The decision to stop new enrollment was
not based on any safety signal or review of any efficacy data. There has been no change in our 
understanding of the safety profile of nivolumab in combination with paclitaxel, 
cyclophosphamide, epirubicin/doxorubicin, and endocrine therapy.
The trial will continue with the participants currently enrolled and the primary endpoint w ill be 
amended to focus solely on pCR.

Overall Design:
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-cont rolled, multicenter, global Phase 3 study. The 
study is designed to evaluate nivolumab vs nivolumab placebo in combination with neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy and adjuvant ET in newly diagnosed, treatment-naive participants with high-risk (defined as Grade 3 disease or Grade 2 disease with low ER expression of 1-10%) BC that is ER+ and HER2-. Participants must have histologically confirmed invasive ductal breast carcinoma 
meeting the characteristics of the Inclusion Criteria.
The study is divided into 3 periods: Screeni ng Period, Treatment Period (Neoadjuvant, Surgery, 
and Adjuvant Phases), and Follow-up Period. Following the confirmation of eligibility, 
participants will be randomized to either Arm A or Arm B in a 1:1 ratio.
The Treatment Period will consist of the following phases:
•Neoadjuvant (Pre-surgery) Phase: maximum of 8 cycles
−Paclitaxel (PTX) Cycles 1-4 (1 cycle = every 3 weeks [Q3W]): nivolumab or nivolumab 
placebo + weekly paclitaxel
Followed by
−Anthracycline-Cyclophosphamide (AC) Cycles 1-4 (1 cy cle = every 2 weeks [Q2W] or 
Q3W [dosing frequency to be determined by the Investigator]): nivolumab or nivolumab 
placebo + AC
•Surgery
•Adjuvant (Post-surgery) Phase: maximum of 7 cycles
−Adjuvant Cycles 1-7 (1 cycle = every 4 weeks [Q4W]): nivolumab + ET or ET alone (per 
Protocol Amendment 03)
Treatment w ill start with the Neoadjuvant (Pre-s urgery) Phase, in which participants will be 
randomized to r eceive an intended 4 cycles of nivolumab  or nivolumab placebo in combination 
with weekly paclitaxel, followed by an intended 4 cycles of nivolumab or nivolumab placebo in 
combination with anthr acycline (doxorubicin or ep irubicin) + cyclophosphamide. Following

completion of the Neoadjuvant (Pre-surgery) Phase of treatment, pa rticipants who remain 
operative candidates w ill undergo breast surgery (per local standards) within 4 weeks. In cases 
when surgery does not occur within 4 weeks, surgery is permitted at a later date. The investigator 
must document the reason for delay of surgery in the CRF and the medical record.
Participants will return to the site within 7-14 days following surgery to begin their Adjuvant 
(Post-surgery) Phase of treatment, consisting of a maximum of 7 cycles of nivolumab +ET or with 
Investigator’s choice of ET alone (per Protocol Amendment 03). The post-surgery visit and the 
first cycle of adjuvant treatment may be combined if adjuvant treatment starts within 7-14 days 
after the breast cancer surgery.
As of Protocol Amendment 03, the Adjuvant phase of the study will be converted to open label, 
and participants will be unblinded when they reach the Adjuvant phase of the study. Participants 
already on adjuvant treatment or in follow-up when Protocol Amendment 03 is approved will also 
be unblinded. No crossover to adjuvant nivolumab will be allowed for participants enrolled in Arm B. Adjuvant systemic therapy should be started no later than 6 weeks following S urgery in
participants not receiving radiotherapy (RT). In participants receiving RT, adjuvant systemic
therapy may start at the same time as RT or no later than 1 to 2 weeks after completion of RT per
local standards. Starting adjuvant systemic ther apy for a few adjuvant cycles then stopping or
pausing therapy to administer RT then restarting adjuvant systemic therapy for remaining adjuvantcycles will not be permitted.
Randomized participants in the study will be stratified by the following factors:
1) PD-L1 on immune cells ( ≥1% or < 1%);
2) Tumor grade (2 or 3);
3) Axillary nodal status (pathol ogical review positive versus radiographic and/or pathologic
review negative); and
4) AC dose-frequency chemotherapy regimen (Q2W or Q3W).
PD-L1 status, used for stratification, is d etermined by qualitative immunohistochemical assay 
using rabbit monoclonal anti-PD-L1 clone SP142 on the proportion of tumor area occupied by 
PD-L1-expressing tumor-infiltrating immune cells (% IC) of any intensity.
Clinical outcomes assessments (C OAs) will be assesse d throughout the study at the timepoints 
defined in the Schedule of Activities.Participants who discontinue study treatment must continue to be followed in this study for 
collection of outcome and/or survival follow-up data , as required, until death or the conclusion of 
the study.
Safety Follow-up Visits will occur after the last Adjuvant (Post-surgery) Phase treatment. As of 
Protocol Amendment 03, the Long-term Follow-up visit will occur 12 months ( ±2 months)
following surgery. The Long-term Follow-up visit w ill be the final visit of the study. For 
participants in follow-up at the time of Protocol Amendment 03, the final study visit will happen 
at the time of the next previously scheduled study visit.

Informed Consent XMust be obtained prior to any study-related procedures.
Register in IRT system to obtain participant number.
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria X Must be confirmed prior to randomization. See  Section 6 (Study Population).
Medical History XAll medical history relevant to the disease under study, including tobacco history and TNM 
staging.
Disease Biomarkers XDocument hormonal receptors (ER, PgR) and HER2 status from local testing.
Document results for mutation status (eg, BRCA1/2, PALB2, PIK3CA ), if known.
Document results, if known, of genomic test(s) for prognostic (eg, Oncotype, MammaPrint, 
Prosigna).
Documentation of Menopausal Status(Women only)X Document menopausal status. See Section 5.1.1 (Screening Period) for definitions.
Pretreatment Tumor Sample Submission XA recent archival primary breast tumor biopsy is required in the format of 1 FFPE tissue 
block (strongly preferred) containing 20 mm3of tissue, collected ≤90 days prior to
enrollment or unstained tumor tissue sections (22 slides) prepared ≤ 60 days prior to 
enrollment from a tissue sample collected ≤ 90 days prior to enrollment.
If a recent breast tumor specimen is not available, a fresh breast tumor biopsy collection is 
required. If < 22 slides are available, a minimum of 15 unstained slides must be submitted for a participant to be eligible. If < 15 unstained slides are available, the participant is not 
eligible.
For participant with planned BCS, surgical clip(s) should be placed preferably prior to starting 
neoadjuvant treatment but no later than PTX C2D1. For participant with planned mastectomy, 
placement of surgical clip(s) is strongly recommended. Placement of surgical clip(s) marks the tumor bed to ensure its a ppropriate localization at the time of the surgery and to enable accurate 
sampling of the specimen by the pathologist. (Refer to pathology manual for additional details).
Central laboratory results for PD-L1 status, ER status, and ER expression level must be 
available prior to randomization.

Documentation of Actual Breast 
SurgeryXRecord the actual type of BC surgery (ie, 
BCS, mastectomy) on day of or within 7 days after surgery.
Surgery (SOC) XSurgery per local SOC should be performed 
within 4 weeks after the completion of the 
neoadjuvant treatment phase (ie, 6-7 weeks after last neoadjuvant dose depending on AC treatment schedule).
In cases, when surgery does not occur within 4 
weeks surgery is permitted at a later date. The 
investigator must document reason for delay of surgery in the eCRF and the medical record.
Surgery may be either BCS or mastectomy as 
determined by the participant and surgeon as per local SOC. 
Appropriate PE, pathologic TNM staging,(after 
resection) and laboratory assessments should 
be performed as per local SOC prior to 
surgery.

3 INTRODUCTION
CA2097FL is a Phase 3, randomized, global study assessing the efficacy and safety of nivolumab 
or nivolumab placebo combined with standa rd neoadjuvant anthracycline-taxane-based 
chemotherapy, followed by nivolumab combined with endocrine therapy (ET) or ET alone (per 
Protocol Amendment 03) as adjuvant treatment, in participants with high-risk, estrogenreceptor-positive (ER+), human epidermal grow th factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) primary 
breast cancer (BC).
The study originally aimed to dem onstrate that treatment with nivolumab combined with standard 
neoadjuvant anthracycline-taxane-based chemotherapy, followed by nivolumab combined with 
ET as adjuvant treatmen t, improves clinical eff icacy in terms of pathological complete response 
rate (pCR) and/or event-free survival (EFS), when compared to standard-of-care (SOC) treatment alone. On 07-Apr-2022, new enrollment to the study was stopped. As of Protocol Amendment 03, pCR is the only primary endpoint and EFS has been changed to an exploratory endpoint.
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of the study treatments 
is provided in the respective Investigator’s Brochures (IBs) and package inserts.
3.1 Study Rationale
Neoadjuvant therapy is used increasingly in patients with primary BC to improve the likelihood 
of local tumor control, assess the treatment sens itivity of the disease in vivo, and increase the 
potential for curable disease by ta rgeting the micrometastatic disease burden.
1Robust individual 
patient-level data meta-analyses from well-conducted clinical trials suggest that achieving a pCR 
is positively associated with improvement in EFS and overall survival (OS); these associations are 
more robust within populations with high-risk BC subtypes.2,3,4Further, use of the neoadjuvant 
setting as a research platform permits rapid assessment of drug efficacy and may expedite clinical 
development of new agents in this setting. Agents that positively and substantially impact pCR rates may have a reasonable expectation of meaningful improvement in EFS.
5,6
Current neoadjuvant SOC, consisting of anthracycline-taxane-based chemotherapy, is effective and tolerable among most patients with primary BC.
7,8,9Chemotherapy is effective in high-risk, 
primary ER+, HER2- disease and pCR rates range from 7-16%, which are lower than those 
achieved in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) and triple-negative breast 
cancer (TNBC) subtypes through chemotherapy with or without human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2) blockade, respectively (30-50%).2In addition, SOC clinical management of 
patients with ER+ BC also includes ET for up to  a 10-year period. In the setting of a high-risk 
disease population receiving neoadjuvant chemother apy, ET is administered in the adjuvant 
setting, with the 2 t reatment modalities not being administered concomitantly.8,9
Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) pathway inhibition has demonstrated clinical activity across multiple tumor types, including BC.

metastatic TNBC.11Preliminary clinical d ata from a Phase 2 adaptive-design neoadjuvant trial 
(I-SPY2) in participants with HER2- BC (ER+, HER2-, and TNBC cohorts) assessed an anti-PD-1 
agent added to standard paclitaxel chemotherapy and demonstrated clinically meaningful 
improvements in pCR relative to historical controls.12These and other early clinical trials support 
currently ongoing Phase 3 neoadjuvant-adjuvant trials that are evaluating anti-PD-1 agents in the

3.1.1 Research Hypothesis
The original research hypothesis was that the combination of nivolumab with anthracycline-
taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by nivolumab with Investigator’s choice 
adjuvant ET will increase pCR r ate and/or prol ong EFS in participants with newly dia gnosed, high-
risk, treatment-naive ER+, HER2- BC. As of Protoc ol Amendment 03, the new research hypothesis 
is that the addition of nivolumab to anthr acycline-taxane-based neoadj uvant chemotherapy will 
increase the pCR rate.

3.2 Background
3.2.1 ER+, HER2- Breast Cancer
ER+, HER2- disease is the most common BC subtype, occurring in ~70% of cases. BC ranks 
second as a cause of cancer-death in women after lung cancer.21,22,23,24An estimated 42,170 BC 
deaths (41,760 women) are expected in 2020 in the United States (US).
In clinical practice, BC tumors are classified by the expression s tatus of estrogen receptor (ER), 
progesterone receptor (PgR), and HER2. The BC subtypes, identified on the basis of these 
receptors, have been reported to b ear distinct gene expression profiles,25,26as well as different 
clinical behaviors, prognoses, and treatment vulne rabilities. Seventy percent of invasive BCs in 
women > 45 years of age express ER and/or PgR, but not HER2, and are termed hormone 
receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-.22Seminal studies performed with gene expression profiling
(GEP) analysis of primary BC samples indicated that the tumors in the HR+, HER2- group are 
significantly enriched with cases showing high expression of genes related to the luminal 
phenotype (ER-responsive genes, luminal cytoker atins, and other luminal-associated markers). 
Consequently, HR+, HER2- BC was found to be significantly enriched with the so-called luminal 
BC intrinsic subtypes. Luminal A comprises 50-60% of all BC, showing higher dependence on 
ER signaling, slower proliferation rate, and an overall more indolent clinical course. Luminal B 
comprises 15-20% of all BC, showing lower de pendence on ER signaling, higher proliferation 
rate, and overall, a more aggressive clinical course and worse prognosis compared with their
Luminal A counterparts.23Patients with Luminal B disease are more likely to benefit from 
chemotherapy compared with the Luminal A subtype.7

ER+, HER2- BC is emerging as a continuing ch allenge to balance outco mes with treatment 
options. This BC subtype is generally associated with lower recurrence rates than other BC 
subtypes within the first 5 years after diagnosis and is associated with a g ood prognosis when 
diagnosed early and appropriately treated. However, despite the availability of both chemotherapy and ET options, the risk of recurrence persists over time in participants with ER+, HER2- BC, 
arguing for additional tr eatment strategies for an unmet need in this population.
24
3.2.2 Nivolumab Mechanism of Action
Cancer immunotherapy rest s on the premise that tumors can be r ecognized as foreign rather than 
as self and can be effectively attacked by an activated immune system. An effective immune 
response in this setting is thought to rely on immunosurveillance of tumor antigens expressed on 
cancer cells that ultimately results in an  adaptive immune response and cancer cell death. 
Meanwhile, tumor progression may depend upon acquisition of traits that allow cancer cells to 
evade immunosurveillance and escape effective innate and adaptive immune responses.27,28,29
Current immunotherapy efforts attempt to br eak the apparent tolerance of the immune system to 
tumor cells and antigens by eith er introducing cancer antigens by therapeutic vaccination or by 
modulating regulatory checkpoints of the immune sy stem. T-cell stimulation is a complex process 
involving the integration of numerous positive as well as negative co-stimulatory signals in 
addition to antigen recognition by the T- cell r eceptor (TCR).30Collectively, these signals govern 
the balance between T-cell activation and tolerance.
PD-1 is a member of the cluster of differentiation 28 (CD28) family of T-cell co-s timulatory 
receptors that also includes CD28, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), 
inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS), and B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA).31PD-1 
signaling has been shown to i nhibit CD28- mediated upregulation of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, 
IL-13, interferon- γ (IFN-γ), and B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL). PD-1 expression has also 
been noted to inhibit T-cell activation and expansion of previously activated cells. Evidence for a 
negative regulatory role of PD-1 comes from studies of PD-1-deficient mice, which develop a variety of autoimmune phenotypes.
32These results suggest that PD-1 blockade has the potential 
to activate anti-self T- cell responses, but these responses ar e variable and dependent upon various 
host genetic factors. Thus, PD-1 deficiency or inhibition is not accompanied by a universal loss of 
tolerance to self-antigens.
In vitro, nivolumab (BMS-936558) binds to PD-1 with high affinity (EC50 0.39-2.62 nM), and 
inhibits the binding of PD-1 to its ligands PD-L1 and programmed death-ligand 2 (PD-L2; 
IC50 ±1 nM). Nivolumab binds specifically to PD-1 and not to related members of the CD28 
family, such as CD28, ICOS, CTLA-4, and BTLA. Blockade of the PD-1 pathway by nivolumab 
results in a reproducible enhancement of both proliferation and IFN- γ release in the mixed 
lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Using a cytomegal ovirus (CMV) re-stimulation assay with human 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the effect of nivolumab on antigen-specific recall response indicated that nivolumab augmented IFN- γ secretion from CMV specific memory T cells 
in a dose-dependent manner vs isotype-matched control. In vivo blockade of PD-1 by a murine

analog of nivolumab enhanced the anti-tumor immune  response and resulted in tumor rejection in 
several immunocompetent mouse tumor models (MC38, SA1/N, and PAN02).33
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmaco logy, efficacy, and safety of nivolumab is 
provided in the current IB.34
3.2.3 Clinical Experience with Nivolumab
The overall clinical safety experience with nivolumab, as either monotherapy or in combination 
with other therapeutics, including cytotoxic chemotherapy, is based on experience in 
approximately 17,700 participants with different tumor types.34Nivolumab monotherapy is 
approved in multiple regions, including the US and Europe (EU), for unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma, pre viously treated m etastatic non-small c ell lung cancer (NSCLC), previously treated 
advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), previously treated relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin 
lymphoma (cHL), previously tr eated advanced or metastatic urot helial carcinoma, and for the 
treatment of previously treated recurrent or metas tatic squamous cell car cinoma of the head and 
neck (SCCHN); it is also approved for previously treated colorectal cancer (CRC), previously 
treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the ad juvant treatment of melanoma in the US. In 
addition, nivolumab has been approved for use in combination with ipilimumab for RCC in the 
US and unresectable melanoma in multiple countries, including the US and EU.34
In 39 participants with heavily pretreated, metastatic TNBC, nivolumab alone or in combination with ipilimumab were tolerable without addition al safety signals detected in the CheckMate 32 
study (unpublished data). In 66 participants with newly diagnosed or pretreated metastatic TNBC, nivolumab with or without various induction therapies, including different classes of low-dose 
cytotoxic chemotherapy (radiation therap y, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, or doxorubicin) 
demonstrated objective response rates (ORRs) ranging from 17% without i nduction therapy to 
35% with doxorubicin induction therapy (TONIC trial).
35A number of clinical trials of nivolumab 
alone or in combination with other treatment modalities focused on participants with BC are 
currently ongoing.36,37,38
Details on the clinical safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of nivolumab, including results from other clinical studies, are summarized in the nivolumab IB.
34
3.2.4 Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
Neoadjuvant (ie, preoperative) therapy is used increasingly in patients with primary BC to improve 
the likelihood of local tumor control, assess the treatment sensitivity of the disease in vivo, and 
increase the potential for curable disease by targeting earlier the micrometastatic disease burden.1
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy also enables anatomic down staging of the tumor and involved lymph 
nodes and may allow more conservative surgery of the breast and axilla. Furthermore, neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy facilitates research in identifyi ng radiological, histological, and molecular 
predictors for response. Lastly, the neoadjuvant approach expedites the evaluation of new 
treatment strategies by using early surrogate endpoints, such as pCR.

Clinical Protocol CA2097FL
BMS-936558 nivolumab
The use of neoadjuvant therapy for BC has been studied in several large randomized trials that 
have compared neoadjuvant chemotherapy with standard adjuvant treatment.39,40,41,42The 
randomized studies evaluating neoadj uvant therapy, as  well as meta-analyses of these studies, have 
shown that neoadjuvant therapy can improve breast conservation rates, decreasing the number of 
women needing to undergo mastectomy.43,44A meta-analysis of 9 randomized studies comparing 
adjuvant with neoadjuvant systemic therapy for BC showed no difference in rates of death, disease 
progression, or distant disease recurrence based upon the timing of the systemic therapy.45The 
aforementioned studies culminated in the neoadjuvant therapy being recommended in international 
guidelines for patients with high-risk/high-grade ER+, HER2- primary BC.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to be effective in primary BC. Robust meta-analyses 
of individual patient-level data from well-conducted clinical trials suggest that achieving a pCR is positively associated with improvement in EFS and OS; in particular, the Collaborative Trials in 
Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer (CTNeoBC) meta-analy sis evaluated 11,955 individuals with primary 
BC treated with neoadjuvant chemother apy as part of clinical trials.
2The results of this 
meta-analysis confirmed an association of pCR with favorable long-term outcomes in high-risk 
populations (ie, HER2+, high- grade HR+, and TNBC subtypes), although the magnitude of pCR 
improvement predictive of the long-term survival benefits could not be determined.2,3,4Further, 
use of the neoadjuvant platform permits rapi d assessment of drug e fficacy and ma y expedite 
clinical development of new agents in this setting. Agents that positively and substantially impact 
pCR r ate may have a reasonable expectat ion of meaningful improvement in EFS.5,6This was
exemplified in Sep-2013, when Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated 
approval of pertuzumab, an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, as part of a complete treatment 
regimen for patients with HE R2+, locally advanced, inf lammatory, or early-stage BC in the 
neoadjuvant setting.
A number of established chemotherapy regimens have activity in the neoadjuvant setting, 
including the following:
•Dose-dense (Q2W) Adriamycin ®(doxorubicin) or ep irubicin + cyclophosphamide (ddAC), 
followed by paclitaxel weekly
•AC every 3 weeks (Q3W) followed by paclitaxel weekly (QW)
•AC followed by docetaxel Q3W
•AC Q3W
•Docetaxel + AC
•ddAC
•Cyclophosphamide + methotrexate + fluorouracil
•Epirubicin + cyclophosphamide
•Docetaxel + cyclophosphamide
According to the National Cancer Care Network (NCCN) Guidelines for BC,8regimens 
recommended in the adjuvant setting may also be used in the neoadjuvant setting. In both settings,

the underlying aim remains the same: eradication or control of undiscovered distant 
micrometastases. Preferred regimens include anthracycline- and taxane-based regimens in patients with high-risk, ER+, HER2- BC.
3.2.5 Background for Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy
The prognosis of patients with primary BC has vastly improved since the first adjuvant 
chemo-endocrine therapy trials in the 1970s. This treatment mod ality was designed origin ally to 
address the problem of distant disease relapse due to micro metastases, which, once clinically 
established, are the ultimate cause of death for the majority of p atients with relapsed BC. 
Incremental improvements in outcomes were achiev ed through systematic ther apeutic escalation, 
including the use of treatment regimens of longer duration, the integration of novel agents, or the 
inclusion of a higher number of agents, albeit at the cost of greater toxicity.
46
Adjuvant ET, corresponding to systemic treatment blocking of ER signaling, is the cornerstone of systemic treatment of individuals  with primary ER+, HER2- BC.
47To date, numerous trials have 
established the survival benefit of adjuvant ET.44,46, 47Extended treatment of 5-10 years with 
tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor (AI) with or without ovarian suppression is now recommended 
for most patients, based on results from several landmark trials;48,49,50,51these trials demonstrated
a 15-20% r elative re duction in the risk of recurrence, which translates to a 2-4% absolute 
improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) for average-risk participants included in these trials.52
Further, among premenopausal women with early BC, the addition of ovarian suppression to 
tamoxifen resulted in significantly higher 8-ye ar rates of DFS and OS than tamoxifen alone 
(83.2% vs 78.9%). The use of exemestane plus ovarian suppression resulted in even higher rates 
of DFS (85.9%).52,53, 54
Since the adoption of adjuvant ET with tam oxifen and AIs (anastrozole, letrozole, and 
exemestane), current efforts now focus on how best  to identify patients at risk for recurrence 
despite optimal adjuvant ET and how best to man age them. Current recommendations suggest that 
patients with ER+, HER2- primary BC who are at a higher risk of relapse occurrence (ie, higher 
grade, low levels of ER expression) receive treatment with chemotherapy followed by ET.
Recent data from the MonarchE study demonstrated benefit in terms of invasive disease ̽free 
survival (iDFS) with the addition of adjuvant abemaciclib (an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent 
kinases 4 and 6 [CDK4/6i]) to endocrine tr eatment for high-risk HR-positive breast cancer 
patients. Abemaciclib plus ET demonstrated superior iDFS versus  ET alone (p = 0.01; hazard ratio, 
0.75; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.93), with 2-year iDFS rates of 92.2% versus 88.7%, respectively. This led 
to the US FDA a pproval on 12-Oct-2021, of  abemaciclib in combinatio n with ET (tamoxifen or 
an aromatase inhibitor) for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with HR-positive, HER2-
negative, node-positive, early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence and a Ki-67 score Ӌ20% as
determined by an FDA-approved test.55

3.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
Based on preclinical a nd clinical d ata, treatment of nivo lumab in combin ation with
anthracycline-taxane-based chemotherapy or in combination with ET is expected to be tolerable,
and toxicities of the treatment are expected to  be manageable and reversible upon dose reduction, 
treatment interruption, or discontinu ation (see Section 5.4 [Scientific Rationale for Study Design]).
Participants in this study will be carefully monitored for key toxicities. Risks will be further 
minimized by adherence to inclusion and exclusion selection criteria (see Section 6 [Study 
Population]), avoidance of prohibited medication (see Section 7.7 [Concomitant Ther apy]), close 
safety monitoring (see Section 9.2 [Adverse Events], Section 9.2.1 [Immune-mediated Adverse 
Events], and Section 9.4 [Safety]), and dose adjustment guidelines (see Section 7.4 [Dosage 
Modification]). These will also be clearly discussed and highlighted during site visits.
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC; see Section 5.1.4.1 [Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee]) will be constituted and will monitor safety and efficacy as outlined in the 
protocol. A St udy Steering Committee (SSC; see Section 5.1.4.2 [Study Steering Committee]) will 
be established, comprising of Investigators and Sponsor personnel participating in the trial, to ensure transparent management of the trial according to the protocol. A BMS Safety Management Team w ill review and evalua te all emerging data across the program for poten tial safety signal 
assessment in a timely manner.
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
anticipated adverse events (AEs) of study trea tments may be found in the respective IBs, Patient

or Summaries of Product Characteristics (SmPCs).65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73
Due to the need to develop improved therapies to improve pCR rates and/or prolong EFS or OS in 
ER+, HER2- BC, and on the basis of the clinical a nd nonclinical data in support of the current 
study, the benefit-risk profile of nivolumab in combination with anthracycline-taxane-based chemotherapy or in combination with ET in newly diagnosed, treatment-naive, high-risk ER+, 
HER2- primary BC is favorable for proceeding with the proposed randomized Phase 3 clinical 
trial.
Starting in Oct-2021, abemaciclib has been approved as an adjuvant treatment in several countries 
and it is expected that some participants may wa nt to receive adjuvant abemaciclib if/when it is 
available. As of Protocol Amendment 03, participants will be unblinded to tr eatment assignment 
in the Adjuvant phase to enable treatment decision making. The primary e ndpoint has been 
amended to focus solely on pCR after neoadjuvant treatment, and EFS has been changed to an exploratory endpoint.
3.3.1 Nivolumab Safety Profile
Overall, the safety profile of nivolumab monothe rapy is manageable and generally consistent 
across completed and ongoing clinical trials, with no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) reached at 
any dose tested up to 10 mg/kg. Most AEs were low-grade (Grade 1 to 2) with relatively few

related high-grade (Grade 3 to 4) AEs. There was no pattern in the incidence, severity, or causality 
of AEs with respect to nivolumab dose level.
A pattern of immune-related AEs has been defined, for which management al gorithms have been 
developed; these are provided in Appendix 6 . Most high-grade events were manageable with the 
use of corticosteroids or hormone replacement ther apy (endocrinopathies) as instructed in these 
algorithms.See Sections 6.2 , 6.4.1, and 7.4.1 for specific severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2

3.3.4 Nivolumab and Anthracycline-Taxane-Based Chemotherapy 
Combination Safety Profile
The safety profile of nivolumab is well characterized and manageable when administered alone or 
in combination with chemotherapy, targeted agents, as well as additional immuno-oncology (IO)
products across many tumor types. In particular, sev eral clinical trials have assessed neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy plus checkpoint inhibition combination approaches for participants with primary 
BC. Relevant safety data from such studies are given below.
In a Phase 2 adaptive-design neoadjuvant tri al (I-SPY2), 69 participants with primary HER2- (ER+ 
and TNBC) BC were randomized to pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, given as 200 mg Q3W plus 
weekly paclitaxel, followed by anthracycline + cyclophosphamide (AC; every 2 weeks [Q2W] or 
Q3W) without pembrolizumab. A total of 46 participants underwent surgery as of Nov-2016. 
In the TNBC cohort (n = 29), pembrolizumab incr eased the raw and estimated pCR rates  by > 50% 
and 40%, respectivel y. In the ER+, HER2- cohort (n = 40), the raw and estimated pCR r ates
increased by 13% and 21%, respectively. Five participants had immune -related Grade 3 AEs,
including hypophysitis (n = 1) and adrenal insufficien cy (n = 4). Of these, 4 participants presented

with the AE after completing the AC treatment (149-179 days after pembrolizumab was initiated); 
1 participant presented prior to the AC treatment (37 days after pembro lizumab was initiated). 
Seven participants had Grade 1 to 2 thyroid abnormalities reported. Overall, the safety profile of 
pembrolizumab was consistent with  that observed in previously reported studies across tumors. 
However, adrenal insufficiency was observed at a higher rate than previously reported in advanced 
cancer. Resolution of symptoms of adrenal insufficiency with use of replacement therapy was 
reported.12
In the Phase 1b KEYNOTE-173 study, pembrolizumab was combined with neoadjuvant treatment 
consisting of weekly nab-paclitaxel   (with or without carboplatin area under the curve [AUC]6 
Q3W), followed by 4 cycles of AC Q3W in 20 participants with TNBC. In the nab-paclitaxel cohort, the pCR rate in breast and nodes (ypT0/Tis  ypN0) was 60% (n = 10) and 90% (n = 10) in 
participants receiving ca rboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel. Dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) of 
myelosuppression occurred in 7 participants and were unrelated to pembrolizumab. Grade 3/4 
treatment-r elated AEs occurred in 8 participants in the nab-paclitaxel cohort and in 10 participants 
in the nab-paclitaxel-carboplatin cohort, of whic h, none were fatal. Three participants discontinued 
for a treatment-related AE (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] elevations with pembrolizumab, n = 2; deep vein thrombosis with chemoth erapy, n = 1). No DLT was attributed to 
pembrolizumab.
10In a recent update in 60 participants evaluating 6 treatment cohorts assessing 
either nab-paclitaxel or paclitaxel with or without carboplatin,7722 (36.7%) participants had a 
DLT. Most DLTs were Grade 3 or 4, with neutropenia the most commonly reported (n = 9). One 
DLT was Grade 5 (septic shock), occurring in  a nab-paclitaxel-carboplatin arm. Grade ≥ 3 
treatment-related AEs were reported in 54 (90%) participants. Grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs 
were neutropenia (73%), febr ile neut ropenia (22%), an emia (20 %), and thrombocytopenia (8%). 
Eighteen participants (30%) had immune-mediate d AEs (IMAEs; Grade 2 hypothyroidism, n = 4; 
Grade 1 hyperthyroidism, n = 3; Grade 3 colitis, n = 2; and Grade 3 rash, n = 2). Eleven 
participants discontinued pembrolizumab due to treatment-related AEs. As expected, toxicity was 
higher in the carboplatin groups.
The combination of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with PD-L1 inhibition has been assessed in 
GeparNuevo, a rando mized, Phase 2 neoadjuvant st udy; a total of 174 participants with primary 
TNBC were randomized to receive neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel, followed by epirubicin/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy with or without durv alumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor. 
A numerically hi gher, but statist ically non-signi ficant increase in pCR (44.2% vs  53.4%, odds r atio 
[OR] 1.53; p = 0.182) was reported. The addition of  durvalumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
was well toler ated. All received growth factor s upport during epirubicin/cyclophosphamide
treatment. Grade 3/4 hematologic AEs were similar in the 2 groups and included anemia (2.2% vs 2.4%), neutropenia (37.1% vs 41.5%), thrombocytopenia (1.1% vs 2.4%), and febrile neutropenia (4.3% vs 2.4%) in the durvalumab and control arms, respectively. Imm une-related AEs were 
higher in the durvalumab arm and included hypothyroidism (6.5% vs 2.4%) and hyperthyroidism 
(7.6% vs 0%), in the durvalumab and control arms, respectively.

In the Phase 3, randomized (2:1), placebo-co ntrolled, KEYNOTE 522 st udy, pembrolizumab 
(200 mg Q3W) was combined with paclitaxel (80 mg/m2QW) and carboplatin (AUC 5 Q3W or 
AUC 1.5 QW) followed by anthracycline (doxorubicin 60 mg/m2or epirubicin 
90 mg/m2)-cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) neoadjuvant chemotherapy (8 cycles) and adjuvant 
pembrolizumab (200 mg Q3W for 9 cycles) in patients with untreated, pr imary TNBC.78The 
addition of pembrolizumab to platinum-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy resulted in a 
statist ically signif icant and clinically meaningful absolute increase in pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) of 
13.6 percentage points (64.8% vs 51.2%, p = 0.00055). A consistent benefit also was observed 
with pCR defined as ypT0 ypN0 and ypT0/Tis. The benefit of pembrolizumab was independent of PD-L1 status using the combined positive score (CPS) method of assessment. Pr eliminary, early 
data suggest there was a favorable trend for EFS in the pembrolizumab arm (HR = 0.63 [95% CI, 0.43-0.93]). Safety was consistent with the known profiles of each regimen albeit with only 9% of the total number of targeted EFS events. Dose -intensity, char acterized by the mean number of 
doses administered and mean treatment duration, was similar across the treatment groups. Across 
neoadjuvant and adjuvant phases, Grade 3 or higher treatment-related AE rates were 78.0% in the 
pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 73.0% in the chemotherapy alone group, and the 
incidence of death was 0.4% vs 0.3%, respectively.

The above studies suggest that the combinat ion of anti-PD-(L)1 and SOC neoadjuvant 
multi-regimen chemotherapy is feasible in patients with primary BC. Thus, the potential benefit 
of combination therapy appears to outweigh th e known risks of these agents and warrants 
clinical investigation.

3.3.5 Nivolumab and Endocrine Therapy Combination Safety Profile
The safety profile of nivolumab is well character ized and manageable when administered alone or 
in combination with chemotherapy, targeted agents, as w ell as additional IO products. Similarly, 
extensive clinical trials have established the efficacy and safety of ET in participants with BC. The 
agents used for standard ET have extensive, established safety databases in this setting. No data 
are available evaluating the combination of nivolumab and ET (eg, tamoxifen, AIs).
One of the initial BC studies assessing checkpoint inhibitors was a Phase 1 study of tr emelimumab, 
an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, combined with exemes tane, in 26 women with heavily pretreated ER+ 
metastatic BC.79Most treatment-related AEs were mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2) in nature. 
The most common events included dia rrhea (46%), pruritus (42%), constipation (23%), and 
fatigue (23%). DLTs were transient serum tran saminase elevations (n = 1) and diarrhea (n = 4). 
The MTD of tremelimumab with exemestane was 6 mg/kg every 90 days, which was lower than 
in other tremelimumab trials. Among 13 participants treated at the MTD, none developed Grade 3 
or Grade 4 treatment-related diarrhea. No PK in teraction was observed between tremelimumab 
and exemestane. At the time of the trial, al gorithm-based manag ement of immune-related

diarrhea/colitis was not yet available nor implemented in the trial; however, it cannot be ruled out 
that diarrhea may have been exacerbated by the combination. With regard to anti-tumor activity, no objective responses were noted; however 11 of the 26 participants experienced stable disease, 
including 4 participants who previously progressed on exemestane. Evidence of T- cell activation 
was reported in the periphery, as measured by ICOS expression. Treatment was associated with 
T-cell activation, as revealed by an in crease in ICOS-expressing T cells in bl ood and a marked
increase in the ratio of ICOS-positive T cells to FoxP3-positive regulatory T cells (Tregs).
79,80
Several ongoing studies are evaluating different e ndocrine agents in combination with checkpoint
inhibitors.81,82
Recent data from the MonarchE study demonstrated benefit in terms of iDFS with the addition of 
adjuvant abemaciclib to ET for high-risk HR-posit ive breast cancer. However, the combination of 
pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) with abemaciclib (CDK4/6  inhibitor) was demonstrated to be not 
feasible because of dose- limiting toxicities. Concurrent administration of abemaciclib to 
pembrolizumab caused an increased incidence of pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease and 
increased rates of Grade 3-4 liver enzyme elevations.83,84,85The incidence was above that which 
would be expected with either ag ent alone. Three treatment-related d eaths associated with 
pneumonitis occurred.84,85Increased toxicity rates were also observed in CheckMate-7A8 testing 
the combination of nivolumab plus palbo ciclib, the same class of drug (CDK4/6i) as 
abemaciclib.86Based on the findings, it does not appear that anti-PD-1 and CDK4/6 inhibitors can 
be safely combined due to increased risk of hepatic and lung toxicities.

5 STUDY DESIGN
5.1 Overall Design
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-cont rolled, multicenter, global Phase 3 study. The 
study is designed to evaluate nivolumab vs nivolu mab placebo in combination with neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy and adjuvant ET in newly diagnose d, treatment-naive participants with high-risk 
ER+, HER2- BC. High-ris k disease is defined as a participant having either Grade 3 disease or 
having Grade 2 disease with low ER expression of 1-10%. Participants must have histologically
confirmed invasive ductal breast carcinoma meeting the char acteristics described in Section 6.1
(Inclusion Criteria).

The study is divided into 3 periods: Screening Period, Treatment Period (Neoadjuvant 
[Pre-surgery] Phase, Surgery, and Adjuvant [Post-surgery] Phase ), and Follow-up Period. 
Following the confirmation of eligibility, participants will be randomized to either Arm A or 
Arm B in a 1:1 ratio.
The Treatment Period w ill consist of the following phases:
•Neoadjuvant (Pre-surgery) Phase: maximum of 8 cycles
−Paclitaxel (PTX) Cycles 1-4 (1 cycle = Q3W): nivolumab or nivolumab placebo + weekly
paclitaxel
Followed by
−Anthracycline-Cyclophosphamide (AC) Cycles 1-4 (1 cy cle = every 2 weeks [Q2W] or
1 cycle = Q3W [dosing frequency to be determined by the Investigator]): nivolumab or
nivolumab placebo + AC cycles 1-4 (1 cycle = Q2W or 1 cycle = Q3W).
•Surgery
•Adjuvant (Post-surgery) Phase: maximum of 7 cycles
−Adjuvant Cycles 1-7 (1 cycle = every 4 weeks [Q4W]): nivolumab + ET or ET alone (per
Protocol Amendment 03)
Treatment w ill start with the Neoadjuvant (Pre-s urgery) Phase, in which participants will be 
randomized to receive an in tended 4 cycles of nivolumab or nivolumab placebo in combination 
with weekly paclitaxel, followed by an intended 4 cycles of nivolumab or nivolumab placebo in 
combination with anthracy cline (doxorubicin or epi rubicin) + cyclophosphamide. Following 
completion of the Neoadjuvant (Pre-surgery) Phase of treatment, pa rticipants who remain 
operative candidates will undergo surgery of the breast and axilla (per local standards) within 
4 weeks. In cases when surgery does not occur within 4 weeks, surgery is permitted at a later date. The investigator must document the reason for d elay of surgery in the CRF and the medical record.
Participants will return to the site within 7-14 days following surgery to begin their Adjuvant 
(Post-surgery) Phase of treatment, consisting of a maximum of 7 cycles of nivolumab with 
Investigator’s choice of ET or ET alone (per Protoc ol Amendment 03). The post-surgery visit and 
the first cycle of adjuvant treatment may be combined if adjuvant treatment starts within 7-14 daysafter the breast cancer surgery.
As of Protocol Amendment 03, the Adjuvant phase will be converted to open label, and 
participants will be unblinded when they r each the Adjuvant phase of the study. Participants 
already on adjuvant treatment or in follow-up when Protocol Amendment 03 is approved will also 
be unblinded. No crossover to adjuvant nivolumab  will be allowed for partic ipants enrolled in Arm 
B. Adjuvant systemic therapy should be started no later than 6 weeks following Surgery in
participants not receiving radiotherapy (RT). In participants receiving RT, adjuvant systemic
therapy may start at the same time as RT or no late r than 1 to 2 weeks after completion of RT per
local standards. Starting adjuvant systemic ther apy for a few adjuvant cycles then stopping or
pausing therapy to administer RT then restarting adjuvant systemic therapy for remaining adjuvant
cycles will not be permitted.

Randomized participants in the study will be stratified by the following factors:
1) PD-L1 on immune cells ( ≥1% or < 1%);
2) Tumor grade (2 or 3);
3) Axillary nodal status (pathological review positive versus radiographic and/or pathologic
review negative) and
4) AC dose-frequency chemotherapy regimen (Q2W or Q3W).
PD-L1 status, used for stratification, is d etermined by qualitative immunohistochemical assay 
using rabbit monoclonal anti-PD-L1 clone SP142 on the proportion of tumor area occupied by 
PD-L1-expressing tumor-infiltrating immune cells (% IC) of any intensity.
Clinical outcomes assessments (C OAs) will be a ssessed throughout the study at the timepoints 
defined in the Schedule of Activities ( Section 2 ).
Safety Follow-up Visits will occur per Table 2-5 , after the last Adjuvant (Post-surgery) Phase 
treatment. As of Protocol Amendment 03, the Long-term Follow-up visit will occur 12 months ( ±
2 months) following surgery per Table 2-5 . The Long-term Follow-up visit w ill be the final visit 
of the study. For participants in follow-up at the time of Protocol Amendment 03, the final study 
visit will happen at the time of the next previously scheduled study visit under Protocol 
Amendment 02 (see Table 2-5 ).
The total duration of the study is  approximately 4 years  from randomization of th e first participant. 
The study may be terminated at any time by the Sponsor. See Section 5.1.3 (Follow-up Period)
and Section 8.1 (Discontinuation from Study Treatment) for additional details.

5.1.1 Screening Period
As of 07-Apr-2022, new participant enrollment to this study is closed. 
Participants will provide written i nformed consent to participate in the study, before completing 
any protocol-specified procedures or evaluations not considered to be part of the participants’ 
standard care. After signing the informed c onsent form (ICF), participants will be e nrolled into 
Interactive Response Technology (IRT) and then be  evaluated for eligib ility. The screening 
assessments are shown in Table 2-1 .
Documentation of the participant’s menopausal s tatus at scr eening/baseline is required for women 
only, following the definitions provided below:
•Premenopausal status is defined as < 12 months since last menstrual period and no prior
bilateral ovariectomy and not receiving es trogen replacement, or biochemical evidence of
premenopausal status, according to local standards.
•Post-menopausal status is defined as ≥ 12 consecutive months since last menstrual period in a
woman over age 45 years (with no identif ied cause other than menopause), prior bilateral
oophorectomy, age < 55 years and amenorrheic for 12 or more consecutive months in theabsence of chemotherapy, tamoxifen, toremifene, or ovarian suppression and
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) > 40 mIU/mL an d estradiol in the post-menopausal range.

Participants must provide a pretreatment (baseline) primary tumor tissue sample meeting eligibility 
requirements as described in Section 6.1 (Inclusion Criteria). The tumor biopsy will be submitted 
to the central laboratory with a pathology report for d etermining PD-L1 and ER s tatus as well as 
ER expression level.  
. Participants should not have received any local or
systemic anticancer therapy before or after the date that the submitted tumor tissue was obtained.
Prior to randomization, PD-L1, ER status and ER expression level percentage, disease grade, 
axillary nodal status, and AC frequency must be available in IRT. Participants with a PD-L1, ER, 
or HER2 status of unknown/not evaluable are not eligible (see Section 6.1 [Inclusion Criteria]). 
Treatment s hould begin within 3 calendar days following rando mization.
The Screening Period for each participant ends with the confirmation of full eligibility of the 
participant or with the confirmation that the parti cipant is a screen failure. This study permits the 
re-enrollment of a participant that has discontinued the study as a pretreatment failure 
(ie, participant has not been randomized). If re-enrolled, the participant must be re-consented.
5.1.2 Treatment Period
Schedules of on-treatment visits and assessmen ts for the Neoadjuvant (Pre-surgery) Phase and 
Adjuvant (Post-surgery) Phase are provided in Table 2-2 ,Table 2-3 , and Table 2-4.
5.1.2.1 Neoadjuvant (Pre-surgery) PhaseFollowing confirmation of eligibility, par ticipants w ill be rando mized to receive nivolumab or

or nivolumab placebo in combination with  anthracycline (doxorubicin or ep irubicin) + 
cyclophosphamide chemotherapy for a maximum of 4 additional cycles (AC Cycles 1-4; 
1 cycle = 2 weeks or 3 weeks); the dose frequency will be selected by the treating physician prior 
to randomization and entered in IRT. Participants will be informed of their scheduled surgery prior
to the completion of the Neoadjuvant (Pre-surgery) Phase.
Dose reduction will not be allowed for nivolumab. Some participants may not receive all 8 cycles 
of planned neoadjuvant therapy (eg, toxicity, refusal to receive furthe r therapy). However, 
participants should receive as much of the planne d neoadjuvant therapy as possible. Such treatment 
decisions will be at the discretion of the Investigator and participant.Additional guidance is given below regarding potential study conduct scenarios that may occur for 
some participants during the course of the Neoadjuvant Phase:
•If a participant discontinues nivolumab or nivolumab placebo st udy tr eatment during the 
Neoadjuvant Phase and continues with chemotherapy study treatment, the participant may 
continue on-study, to receive s urgery, and transition to the Adjuvant phase to receive e ndocrine 
therapy and nivolumab or ET study treatment alone (per P rotocol Amendment 03), unless 
consent is withdrawn and/or medical conditions necessitate the participant to discontinue study 
treatment. See Section 7 (Treatment) for additional details.
•If a participant discontinues paclitaxel during the Neoadjuvant Phase, the participant may 
continue on-study to receive neoadjuvant AC and nivolumab or nivolumab placebo study treatment or may transition to the Adjuvant Phas e, after Surgery, to receive endocrine therapy 
and nivolumab or ET study tr eatment alone (per Protocol Amendment 03) at an ear lier 
timepoint, unless consent is withdrawn and/or medical conditions necessitate the participant to 
discontinue the study treatment. See Section 7 (Treatment) for additional details.
•If a participant discontinues th e AC treatment during the Neoadjuvant Phase, nivolumab or 
nivolumab placebo must also be discontinued and the participant may continue on study to receive S urgery and transition to the Adjuvant Phase to r eceive endocrine therapy and 
nivolumab or ET study tr eatment alone (per Protocol Amendment 03), unless consent is 
withdrawn and/or med ical c onditions necessitate the participant to discontinue st udy tr eatment.
•If chemotherapy is delayed, nivolumab or nivolumab placebo is also delayed. Nivolumab or 
nivolumab placebo can resume within 3 days of the scheduled chemotherapy dose if 
chemotherapy re-treatment criteria are met.
If participant has worsening of disease or disease progression during the Neoadjuvant Phase that 
precludes definitive surgery or results in metastatic disease the event is recorded as an EFS event, and the participant continues in the follow-up period. See Section 5.1.3 (Follow-up Period).
Participants who discontinue study treatment must continue to be followed in this study for collection of outcome and/or survival follow-up data, as required and in line with  Section 5 (Study 
Design), until death, withdrawal of consent, or the conclusion of the study.
5.1.2.2 Surgery
Following the completion of the neoadjuvant treatment phase (completion of p aclitaxel cycles 1-4, 
1 cycle = 3 weeks and AC cycles 1-4, 1 cycle = Q2W or Q3W), all participants who remain

operative candidates will undergo surgery of the breast and axilla (per local standards) within 
4 weeks of the completion of the neoadjuvant treatmen t phase (ie, 6-7 weeks after last neoadjuvant 
dose depending on AC treatment schedule).
In cases when surgery does not occur within 4 weeks of the completion of the neoadjuvant 
treatment phase, surgery is permitted at a later date. The investigator must document the reason for the delay of surgery in the eCRF and the medical record.
For participants who undergo BCS, the margins of the resected surgical specimen must be 
histologically free of invasive tumor as well as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as determined by 
the local pathologist. If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed at the discretion of the treating physician to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after potential subsequent 
re-excision(s), the participant must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible for the Adjuvant (Post-surgery) Phase. Participants with margins positive for lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are 
eligible for the Adjuvant Phase without additional resection.
For participants who undergo mastectomy (and/or nipple- or skin-sparing mastectomy), margins 
must be free of gross residual tumor. It is reco mmended that participants should have a negative 
microscopic margin in accordance with local pathology protocol. Participants with a microscopic 
positive deep margin are eligible for the Adjuvant Phase. Information on the type of surgery performed and reason why different from the planne d surgery at baseline will be collected and 
recorded in the eCRF and in the patient medical record.
Surgery specimens will be collected for histologi cal examination of pCR, as well as other 
pathology parameters and endpoint analyses, as outlined in Section 4 (Objectives and Endpoints).
For additional details, please re fer to the Pathology Manual.
5.1.2.3 Radiotherapy
Post-operative RT is required if breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is performed, per international 
guidelines and/or local standards. In the even t of mastectomy, administration of adjuvant RT
should follow local clinical pract ice.
In participants receiving RT, adjuvant systemic therapy (nivolumab + endocrine therapy [ET] or ET alone [per Protocol Amendment 03]) may start:
1) Any time from the post-surgery visit or
2) At the same time as RT or3) During RT or4) Within 1 to 2 weeks of completion of RT per local standards.
Note: Starting adjuvant sy stemic therapy, then stopping or pausing to administer RT, and then 
restarting adjuvant systemic therapy for remaining adjuvant cycles will not be permitted.
In participants not receiving RT, adjuvant systemic therapy should be started no later than 6 weeks 
following surgery.

In cases of BCS, breast RT after complete lo cal excision is mandatory. Breast RT may be 
contraindicated in participants with significant comorbidity (for example, scleroderma and 
systemic lupus erythematosus). Reasons for not delivering breast RT after complete local excision 
of the primary breast cancer should be discussed with the Medical Monitor (or designee) and 
documented in the eCRF.
Recommendations for post-surgical RT are described in Appendix 7 (Radiotherapy Guidelines).
5.1.2.4 Adjuvant (Post-surgery) Phase
Participants will ret urn to the clinic within 7-14 days following Surgery for a post-s urgical visit.
The post-surgery visit and th e first cycle of adjuvant tr eatment may be combined if adjuvant 
treatment starts within 7-14 days after the breast cancer surgery.
Documentation of the participant’s me nopausal status at the post-surgical visit for participants who 
were premenopausal at baseline is required, following the definition provided below:
•Premenopausal status is defined as < 12 months since last menstrual period and no prior
bilateral ovariectomy and not receiving es trogen replacement, or biochemical evidence of
premenopausal status, according to local standards.8
As of Protocol Amendment 03, treatment in the Adj uvant phase will be open label; participants 
will be treated acc ording to their unblinded randomized tr eatment assignment. No crossover is 
allowed per protocol.
Adjuvant (Post-surgery) Phase of treatment w ill begin with the administr ation of nivolumab in 
combination with Investigator’s choice ET (Arm A) or Investigator’s choice ET only (Arm B) for 
a maximum of 7 cycles (Cycles 1 to 7; 1 cycle = 4 weeks), except in the event of disease recurrence 
or progression, withdrawal of consent, death, unacceptable toxicity, or symptomatic deterioration. 
Participants who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than death or withdrawal of consent will proceed to the Follow-Up Period of the study.
Besides the ET (Arm B) and ET in combination with nivolumab (Arm A), no further adjuvant 
treatment (chemotherapy, iCDK4/6 inhibitor, or a ny drug administered with the intent of treating
the cancer) is allowed in the Adjuvant Phase,  irrespective of the pCR outcome of the surgery.
The selected ET may be rotated, changed, or switched to another ET (ie, from tamoxifen to an AI, 
from an AI to tamoxifen, from AI to another AI) during the study at the discretion of the 
Investigator. Ovarian function suppression (chemical or s urgical) is allowed to be used with ET. 
The respective change should be clearly recorded in the source documents.
5.1.3 Follow-up Period
5.1.3.1 Safety Follow-up Visits
There will be 2 in-person safety follow-up visits. Follow-up visit 1 (FU1) will occur 
30 days ( ±7 days) from the last dose of the study treatment. Follow-up visit 2 (FU2) w ill occur 
approximately 100 days ( ±7 days) from the last dose of study tr eatment. Study treatments are 
defined in Table 7-1 .

documented in the source documents and signed by the Investigator. If the participant withdraws 
from study, the study staff may use a public information source (eg, county records) to obtain information about survival status only.
5.1.4 External Committees
5.1.4.1 Independent Data Monitoring Committee
An IDMC will provide oversight of safety and e fficacy considerations in protocol CA2097FL and 
provide adv ice to the Sponsor regarding actions the committee deems necessary for the continued 
protection of participants enrolled in the study. The IDMC will be charged with assessing such 
actions in light of an acceptable benefit-risk profile.
The IDMC will act in an advisory capacity to th e Sponsor, monitor participant safety, and evaluate 
the available efficacy data for the study. The oncol ogy therapeutic area of the Sponsor has pr imary 
responsibility and decision-making authority for the design and c onduct of the study , as well as 
any protocol-related aspects.The IDMC will hold regular meetings to evaluate the ongoing benefit-risk of the trial, including 
data internal and external to the trial. The IDMC will meet to review all available data (safety and 
efficacy) at each meeting, to be held approximately every 6 months, o r more frequently, as needed. 
At the conclusion of each IDMC meeting, the committee will provide the Sponsor with a 
recommendation to continue, modify, or terminate the study protocol based upon their review. 
Ultimately, decisions regarding the study prot ocol will be made by the Sponsor in conjunction 
with feedback from the Investigators and IDMC.
When required, adjudicated events will be sub mitted to the IDMC and Health Authorities for 
review on a specified timeframe, in accordance with the adjudication documen tation.
Additional details concerning IDMC oversight are provided in the IDMC charter.
5.1.4.2 Study Steering Committee

5.4 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
5.4.1 Rationale for Choice of Patient Population
Participants with newly diagnosed, treatment-naiv e, high-risk, histologically proven ER+, HER2-
primary BC, who are eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, w ill be included in this st udy 
population. De spite the av ailability of cytotoxic chemotherapy, as w ell as ET in  this s etting, 
relapses occur for a not insignificant proportion of patients with high-risk ER+, HER2- BC. 
Furthermore, due to the lower pCR typically achieved compared with other BC subtypes, there 
remains an unmet medical need in this patient population.
ER+, HER2- disease is the most common BC subtype occurring in ~70% of BC cases and most 
BC deaths occur in ER+ patients.22,23,24ER+ cancer is emerging as a continuing challenge to 
balance outcomes with treatment options. This BC s ubtype is generally associated with lower 
recurrence rates than other BC subtypes within the first 5 years after diagnosis and is associated 
with a good prognosis when diagnosed early and appropriately treated. However, despite the availability of both chemotherapy and ET options, the risk of recurrence persists over time within 
this patient population, a rguing for addition al treatment strategies for an unmet need in this 
population.
24
The ER+, HER2- population is a hete rogeneous BC subtype. There is a subgroup of patients with 
high-risk clinicopathologic features and a poorer prognosis that is characteristic of the so-called
Luminal B molecular subtype, which was identified by GEP analysis studies.87,88ER+, HER2-
tumors that are high-grade have higher measures of proliferation and lower levels of ER and PgR 
expression tend to be less sensitive to ET and mo re likely to benefit from chemotherapy, compared 
to their counterparts falling under the so-called Luminal A subtype,7but patients still recur despite 
treatment. The current study w ill assess the combin ation of nivolumab and 
anthracycline-taxane-based chemotherapy and nivolumab combined with SOC ET in this patient population.
Patients with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic,  high-risk ER+, HER2- BC represent an important 
unmet need. Their risk of disease relapse is high, especially in those who do not obtain a pCR after 
their neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In contrast, those who do achieve pCR have a better prognosis 
concerning disease relapse. There are preclini cal as well as emerging clinical data available to 
suggest the potential of PD-1 inhibition to improve clinical outcomes in early BC.
5.4.2 Rationale for Choice of Endpoints
Neoadjuvant therapy is increasi ngly used in patients with earl y BC to improve the likeli hood of 
local tumor control, assess the treatment sensitivity of the disease in vi vo, and increase the potential 
for curable disease by targeting the micrometas tatic disease burden.

patient-level data meta-analyses from well-conducted clinical trials suggest that achieving a pCR 
is positively associated with improvement in EFS and OS; these associations are more robust
within populations with high-risk BC subtypes.2,3,4Further, use of the neoadjuvant platform 
permits rapid assessment of d rug efficacy and may expedite clinical development of new agents 
in this setting. Agents that positively and substantially impact pCR r ate may have a reasonable 
expectation of meaningful improvement in EFS.5,6
5.4.3 Rationale for Chemotherapy Plus PD-1 Inhibition
Immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy has been shown to improve response and OS, 
when compared to these agents used individually , in BC and other tumor types in the metastatic 
setting. It is hypothesized that chemotherapy may modify the immune response to tumors by influencing multiple mechanisms, including inducing immunogenic cell death, stimulating release of tumor antigens and/or depleting immuno-suppressive Tregs.
Current SOC, consisting of anthracycline-taxane-based chemotherapy administered in the 
neoadjuvant setting, is effective and tolerable among most patients with early BC.
7,8,9
Chemotherapy is effective in high-risk, primary ER+, HER2- disease and pCR rates ra nge from 
7-16%, which are lower than those achieved in other BC subtypes (30-50%).2
PD-1 pathway inhibition has demonstrated clinical activity across multiple tumor types, including BC.
10,11,12,13,14,15,16There is strong rationale for combining checkpoint blockade with 
chemotherapy in patients with newly d iagnosed ER+, HER2- BC. An  accumulati ng body of 
preclinical17and clinical data10,11,12,16supports the combination of anti-PD-1 agents and 
chemotherapy to improve clinical outcomes in early  and advanced settings across BC subtypes; 
such data culminated recently in the first approval of a PD-L1 inhibitor coupled with single-agent 
chemotherapy for patients with newly di agnosed, PD-L1+ (assessed in the immune- cell 
component of the disease) metastatic TNBC.11
Increasing understanding of the imm unobiology of BC indicates that PD-1 inhibition could exert 
potent antitumor activity across all BC subtypes, including cases with ER+, HER2- disease. 
A recently reported st udy employed single- cell proteomics-based analysis, based on a panel of 
73 antibodies, tailored to interrogate the different (immune-)phenotypes of BC.89A total number 
of 144 tumor samples were analyzed, exceedi ng a total of 26 million single cells phenotyp ically 
characterized. High frequencies of PD-L1+ tumo r-associated macrophages and exhausted T cells 
were found in high-grade ER+ and ER- tumors, thus indicating that PD-1 inhibition may be a 
viable therapeutic strategy to reactivate the exhausted immune system. Furthermore, lymphocytic infiltration of ER+, HER2- BC tumors has been reported frequently, with a positive correlation 
with lower ER expression and/or high grade.
90,91
Preliminary clinical data from a Phase 2 adaptive desi gn neoadjuvant trial (I-SP) in participants 
with HER2- BC (ER+, HER2-, and TNBC cohorts) assessed an anti-PD-1 agent added to standard 
paclitaxel chemot herapy, and demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in pCR r ates
relative to historical controls.12An absolute increase in the estimated pCR of 21% was observed 
Protocol Amendment No.: 03

BMS-936558 nivolumab
(34% with pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W plus standard therapy compared to 13% with standard 
therapy alone) in participants with HR+, HER2- BC. The safety profile of pembrolizumab was 
consistent with that observed in previously reported studies across tumors.12Similar results in the 
TNBC subtype from Phas e 2 trials, indicating increased pCR rates (~60-80%) with either 
pembrolizumab or durvalumab plus taxane and an thracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
with or without carboplatin in participants with TNBC, suggest potential clinical activity with 
tolerable safety, while maintaining a full dose of chemotherapy.10,16
Data are available for nivolumab in participants with BC. Nivolumab was evaluated after a short 
induction with 1 of 3 low-dose chemoth erapy treatments, irradiation, or no i nduction, in 
50 participants with m etastatic TNBC in a Phase 2 trial. After a 2-week i nduction period,
participants received nivolumab 3 mg/ kg Q2W until progression. With a median 4-month 
follow-up, the ORR was 22%, with 2 complete responses (4%) and 9 par tial res ponses (18%). 
Median duration of response was 10.9 months. These findings suggest that administering 
nivolumab after priming the tumor microenvironment (TME) with either low-dose chemotherapy 
or irradiation is feasible and may render the TME more sensitive to anti-PD-1 agents, which may 
help to improve clinical response rates.35
Nivolumab was evaluated in 39 participants with metastatic TNBC in the CheckMate 32 
(CA209032) study, which demonstrated a favorable safety profile for nivolumab monotherapy and 
nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab. The sa fety profile of nivolumab  is well characterized 
from a large safety database at different doses and schedules, as monotherapy or in combination. 
Consistent with the mechanism of action of nivolumab, the most frequently reported drug-related AEs observed in clinical trials are those associated with activation of the immune system. The most common types of IMAEs include endocrinopath ies, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, 
nephritis, and rash.
A number of ongoing studies are evaluating different  chemotherapeutic agents in combination with 
checkpoint inhibitors in patients with BC.
5.4.4 Rationale for Endocrine Therapy Plus PD-1 Inhibition
The safety profile of nivolumab is well characterized and manageable when administered alone or 
in combination with chemotherapy, targeted agents, as well as additional IO products. No data are 
available evaluating the combination of nivolumab and ET (eg, tamoxifen, AIs).
However, checkpoint inhibition via a different immune pathway (CTLA-4) has been reported in 
combination with endocrine therapy in patients with breast cancer.
79In cancer patients, CTLA-4 
appears to regulate immune responses early in T- cell activat ion, whereas PD-1 inhibits the effector 
phase of T-cell activity in the tumor mic roenvironment. Based on current understanding, 
checkpoint inhibitors all act to attenuate T- cell activity, and it is th ought that anti-CTLA-4 
(eg, ipilimumab and tremelimumab) and anti-PD-1 (eg, nivolumab) primar ily act at di fferent 
stages of the cancer immunity cycle.92,93
One of the initial BC studies assessing checkpoint inhibitors was a Phase 1 study of tremelimumab, 
an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, combined with exemes tane in 26 women with heavily pretreated ER+

metastatic BC.79No objective responses were noted; howev er 11 of 26 participants experienced 
stable disease, including 4 participants who previously progressed on exemestane. Evidence of 
T-cell activation was re ported in the periphery, as measured by ICOS expression. Treatment was
associated with T-cell activation, as revealed by an increase in ICOS-e xpressing T cells in blood
and a marked increase in the ratio of ICOS-positive T cells to FoxP3-positive Tregs.79,80Most
treatment-related AEs were  mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2) in  nature. The most common events
included diarrhea (46%), pruritus (42%), constipation (23%), and fatigue (23%).
Rationale for combining immunotherapy with ET comes from several sources. In a pooled 
assessment of stromal TIL concentrations in participants with BC treated in 6 randomized trials of 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, pCR had a strong positive correlation with TIL concentrations in all 
BC subtypes. Of note, there was a negative survival eff ect with higher TIL concentration in 
participants with ER+, HER2- BC, unlike the posit ive survival effect observed with TNBC and 
HER2+ BC subtypes. In the ER+, HER2- BC cohort, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were not prognostic for DFS and low TIL c oncentrations were associated with improved survival. 
Therefore, the effect of TILs on OS had the opposite effect for ER+, HER2- BC tumors, as compared with TNBC and HER2+ BC subtypes. The negative effect of higher TILs on survival in participants with ER+, HER2- tumors was most  pronounced in the large group of participants not 
achieving a pCR and was stronger for OS than for DFS.
90,94
The negative impact of higher TILs may be explained by increasing resistance to ET in ER+, HER2- BC. Poor response to AI tr eatment has been associated  with increased immune 
activity, TILs, and immune-related genes.
95,96Pretreatment expression of an inflammatory 
signature correlated with antiproliferative response to anastrozole in 112 postmenopausal women 
receiving 2-week treatment. Higher e xpression of immune-related genes, such as signaling 
lymphocytic activation mo lecule family member 8 (SLAMF8) and tumor necrosis f actor (TNF),
as well as lymphocytic infiltration were a ssociated with p oorer res ponse (p < 0.001) to neoadjuvant 
anastrozole.95Similar findings s uggest that the presence of i mmune-related genes were highly 
predictive of poor antiproliferative response to AIs.96These data suggest that patients with 
evidence of high immune-related gene expressi on and/or lymphocytic infiltration may be 
candidates for immune-modulators in combination with ET.
These findings suggest a rationale for further ev aluation of checkpoint inhibitors, such as 
nivolumab, in combination with ET.See Section 3.3.5 (Nivolumab and Endocrine Therapy Combination Safety Profile) for additional 
details.Several ongoing studies are evaluating different ET agents in combination with checkpoint 
inhibitors.
81,82
5.4.5 Rationale for Stratification Factors
Randomized participants in the study will be stratified by the following factors:
1) PD-L1 on immune cells ( ≥1% or < 1%);
Protocol Amendment No.: 03
Date: 27-Jun-2022 78
4.0 Approved 930139564 4.0v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA2097FL
BMS-936558 nivolumab
2) Tumor grade (2 or 3, with maximum number of participants with tumor grade 2 BC not
exceeding 20% of the ITT population);
3) Axillary nodal status (patholog ic review positive versus radiographic and/or pathologic review
negative, with maximum number of participan ts with node-negative BC not exceeding 20% of
the ITT population); and
4) AC dose-frequency chemotherapy regimen (Q3W or Q2W).
PD-L1 status, used for stratification, is d etermined by qualitative immunohistochemical assay 
using rabbit monoclonal anti-PD-L1 clone SP142 on the proportion of tumor area occupied by 
PD-L1-expressing tumor-infiltrating immune cells (% IC) of any intensity.
5.4.5.1 PD-L1 Status
PD-L1 expression has previously been evaluated as a potential predictive marker for tr eatment 
outcome in patients receiving anti-PD-L1 therapy for advanced TNBC. In a Phase 1 study 
evaluating 116 participants with metastatic TNBC who were treated with atezolizumab, those with 
PD-L1 expression in ≥  1% of tumor-infiltrating immune cells had higher ORRs and longer OS 
(12% [11 of 91] and 10.1 [95% CI, 7.0 -13.8] months, respectively) than those with PD-L1 
expression in < 1% of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (0% [0 of 21] and 6.0 [95% CI, 2.6-12.6] 
months, respectively), while no major differences in ORR were seen between participants with 
PD-L1 expression on ≥1% of tumor cells  (12% [95% CI, 2.5%-31.2%]) and those with PD-L1 
expression on < 1% of tumor cells (9.2% [95%CI, 4.1%-17.3%]).13Similar findings in a Phase 1b 
study of avelumab in heavily pretreated participants with metastatic BC (TNBC and ER+, HER2-
cohorts) demonstrated a trend toward a highe r ORR in participants with PD-L1+ vs 
PD-L1-negative (PD-L1-) tumors asso ciated immune cells in the overall populatio n (16.7% vs
1.6%) and in the TNBC c ohort (22.2 % vs 2.6%).15In participants with untreated metastatic TNBC, 
atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel combination therapy reduced the risk of disease worsening or death by 20% in all participants and 38% in  the subgroup expressing PD-L1, as reported from the 
IMpassion 130 study.
11In the IMpassion 130 study, PD-L1 positivity was defined as expression 
on tumor-infiltrating immune cells in ≥ 1% of the tumor area.
Similar findings suggesting PD-L1 positivity on immune cells is associated with response was reported in the Phase 2 KATE2 study in 200 partic ipants with previously treated advanced HE R2+ 
BC. This placebo-controlled study evaluated tr astuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) plus atezolizumab 
vs T-DM1. The primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) in the ITT population was not 
met; however, in participants expressing PD-L1 ≥1% on immune cells, PFS was 8.5 months with 
T-DM1 plus atezolizumab vs 4.1 months with T-DM1 alone. Response rates were 54% vs 33%,
respectively. Similarly, in participants with high levels of TILs, the median PFS was higher with
atezolizumab (8.5 vs 5.3 months, respectively). In the PD-L1- group, atezolizumab added nobenefit, nor did it add benefit for participants with higher HER2 expression
(immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ vs 1+ or 2+).
97
In a Phase 1b study, pembrolizumab and abemaciclib demonstrated a confirmed ORR of 28.6% in 
heavily pretreated par ticipants with metastatic HR+, HER2- BC, without association to PD-L1

BMS-936558 nivolumab
positivity.98In this case, PD-L1 positivity was defined as the CPS of PD-L1 expression on both 
tumor and immune cells, relative to the total tumor cells, of ≥ 1%.
More recent data in the neoadjuvant breast cancer  setting have suggested that PD-L1 expression 
may be prognostic and not predictive of treatment benefit from anti-PD-L1.99,100,101
To evaluate PD-L1 status on efficacy analyses, PD-L1 expression on tumor-infiltrating immune 
cells of≥ 1% based on PD-L1 SP142 was selected as a str atification factor for this study and used 
for secondary endpoint analysis. In addition, for exploratory  analysis PD-L1 expression 
determined by PD-L1 IHC 28-8 CPS w ill also be explored to assess its potential imp act on 
efficacy.
5.4.5.2 Tumor Grade
Pathologic characteristics of the tumor are recognized as having prognostic significance.102Tumor 
grade is a known prognostic factor in patients with early BC.103
Multiple grading systems are available, with the most widely accepted being the 
Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) classification.102Mitotic index, differentiation, and 
pleomorphism are scored from 1 to 3 and the sc ores from each category are totaled. Tumors with 
scores from 3 to 5 are well differen tiated (Grade 1), wh ile scores from 6 to 7 are moder ately 
differentiated (Grade 2), and scores from 8 to 9 are poorly differentiated (Grade 3).
Robust studies and meta-analyses have reported a correlation between histologic grade and EFS 
and/or DFS, such that higher grade or low ER  expression portends a poorer long-term s urvival.2,104
In a large meta-analysis in early BC, the pCR rate was positively associ ated with EFS (HR, 0.49
[95% CI, 0.33-0.71]) and OS (HR,  0·43 [95% CI, 0.23-0.71]) in the ER+/HER2- population. The 
association between pCR and long-term outcome was stronger in patients with higher-grade 
tumors than in those with lower-grade tumors.2Similarly, pCR rates appear higher in patients 
having lower ER expression compared with thos e having higher ER expression after neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy.105Patients with low ER expression appear to behave similarly to ER-negative 
(ER-) disease, and this may translate to improved longer-term outcome106,107in those having a 
pCR. Thus, tumor grade was selected as a stratification factor for this study.
5.4.5.3 Axillary Nodal Status
A significant prognostic factor for patients with primary BC is the presence or absence of axillary 
lymph node involvement. There is a direct relationship between th e number of involved axillary 
nodes and the risk for distant recurrence. Noda l groups were characterized based on the National 
Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) data: negative nodes (0 nodes), 1-3 positive nodes, 4-9 positive nodes, and 10 or more positive nodes. The 5-year survival for patients with 
node-negative disease is 82.8% compared with 73% for 1-3 positive nodes, 45.7% for 4-12 positive 
nodes, and 28.4% for ≥13 positive nodes.
108
A recent retrospective review with long-term fo llow-up demonstrated an increased risk of 
recurrence and BC-related death in women who had occult or micrometastatic tumor deposits in 
Protocol Amendment No.: 03

their axillary lymph nodes.109Similar results were observed in the International Breast Cancer 
Study Group Trial V of 1,275 node -negative women randomly assigned to a single cycle of 
perioperative cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-flourouracil (CMF) vs no chemotherapy.110
These micrometastases, detected by either met hod, were associated with a higher risk of 
recurrence.
Axillary nodal status (confirmed pathologically) is the most consistent prognostic factor used in 
therapy decision making and was selected as a stratification factor for enrollment in this study.
5.4.5.4 Anthracycline-Cyclophosphamide Dose Frequency
Increasing the dose intensity of adjuvant chemotherapy by shortening the interval between 
treatment cycles, or by giving i ndividual drugs sequentially rath er than giving the same drugs 
concurrently, moderately reduces the 10-year risk of recurre nce and death from BC without 
increasing mortality from other causes.111
An individual patient-level meta-analysis of trials comparing 2-weekly vs standard 3-weekly 
schedules, and of trials comparing sequential vs concurrent administration of anthracycline and 
taxane chemotherapy was conducted by the Ox ford group. Individual patient data were provided 
for 26 of 33 relevant trials identified, comprising 37,298 (93%) of 40,070 women randomized. Most women were aged younger than 70 years and had node-positive disease.
Combined data showed fewer BC recurrences with dose-intense than with standard-schedule chemotherapy (10-year recurrence risk, 28.0% vs 31.4%; relative risk 0.86 [95% CI, 0.82-0.89]; 
p < 0.0001). Ten-year BC mortality wa s similarly reduced (18.9% vs 21.3%; relative risk, 0.87
[95% CI, 0.83-0.92]; p < 0.0001), as was all -cause mortality (22.1% vs 24.8%; r elative risk, 0.87
[95% CI, 0.83-0.91]; p < 0.0001). Death wit hout recurrence was, if  anything, lower with 
dose-intense than with standard-schedule chemotherapy (10-year risk, 4.1% vs 4.6%; relative risk,
0.88 [95% CI, 0.78-0.99]; p = 0.034). Rec urrence reductions were similar in the 7 trials 
(n = 10,004) that compared 2-weekly chemotherapy with the same chemotherapy given 3-weekly (10-year risk, 24.0% vs 28.3%; relative risk, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.76-0.91]; p < 0·0001), in the 6 trials (n = 11,028) of sequential vs concurrent anthracy cline plus taxane chemotherapy (28.1% vs 31.3%; 
relative risk, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.80-0.94]; p = 0.0006), and in the 6 trials (n = 6532) testing both 
shorter intervals and sequential administration (30.4% vs 35.0%; relative risk, 0.82[95% CI, 0.74-0.90]; p < 0.0001). The proportional reductions in recurrence with dose-intense 
chemotherapy were similar and highly significant (p < 0.0001) in ER+ and ER- disease and did 
not differ significantly by other patient or tumor characteristics.
111
To evaluate AC dose intensity on efficacy analyses, AC frequency was selected as a stratification 
factor for this study.

5.5 Justification for Dose
5.5.1 Justification for Dose of Nivolumab5.5.1.1 Nivolumab 240-mg Every-2-Week Dosing Regimen
Nivolumab 240 mg Q2W infused over 30 minutes is approved by FDA and European Medicines
Agency (EMA) for all nivolumab a pproved indications as monotherapy.
56,65Nivolumab 240 mg 
Q2W infused over approximately 30 minutes will be examined in combination with neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy in this study.
5.5.1.2 Nivolumab 360-mg Every-3-Week Dosing Regimen
Nivolumab monotherapy has been extensively studied in multiple tumor types, including 
melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, cHL, SCCHN, and urothelial carcinoma, using body 
weight-normalized dosing (mg/kg), and has been safely administered at doses up to 10 mg/kg Q2W. Nivolumab is currently approved for the treatment of various tumors, including melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, cHL, SCCHN, and urothelial carcinoma, using a regimen of either nivolumab 
240 mg Q2W, nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W, or nivolumab 480 mg Q4W.
Nivolumab has been shown to be safe and w ell tolerated up to a dose level of nivolumab 10 mg/kg 
Q2W. Population PK (PPK) analyses have shown that the PK of nivolumab is linear, with 
proportional exposures over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg; no differences in PK across 
ethnicities and tumor types were observed. Using the PPK model, the exposures following 
administration of several dosing regimens of nivolumab administered as a flat dose were 
simulated, including nivolumab 360 mg Q3W. The simulated steady-state average concentration (Cavgss) following administration of nivolumab 360 mg Q3W are expected to be similar to those 
following administration of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W and nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W administered 
to participants weighi ng 80 kg, the approximate median weight of participants with NSCLC, 
melanoma, and RCC used in the PPK analyses. Given that the Cavgss estimates for nivolumab 360 mg Q3W are predicted to be similar to those for nivolumab 240 mg Q2W and 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W, the efficacy is predicted to be similar for these regimens. It should be 
noted that the maximum-observed concentrations at steady state following nivolumab 360 mg Q3W are predicted to be less than those following the administration of nivolumab 10 mg/kg Q2W, providing sufficient safety margins. Further details on 
nivolumab 360 mg Q3W dosing can be found in the IB.
34
Finally, nivolumab 360 mg Q3W is currently bei ng investigated in combination with a number of 
other agents, including platinum-doublet chemotherapy dosing, with no new or increased safety 
events observed to date. By usi ng nivolumab 360 mg Q3W in this study, it allows for aligning 
doses of nivolumab at the same dosing frequency of the experimental agent.
Nivolumab 360 mg Q3W infused over approximately 30 minutes will be examined in 
combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in this study.

5.5.1.3 Nivolumab 480-mg Every-4-Week Dosing Regimen
Nivolumab 480 mg Q4W infused over 30 minutes was approved by FDA in Mar-2018 for the
majority of indications approved for nivolumab. The EMA has also approved inclusion of this
dosing schedule in the label for nivolumab for the treatment of patients with advanced melanomaand previously treated RCC.
Nivolumab 480 mg Q4W infused over approximately 30 minutes will be examined in 
combination with Investigator’s choice of ET in this study.
5.5.2 Justification for Dose of Chemotherapy Agents
Chemotherapy regimens used in the neoadjuvant setting are the same as those used in the adjuvant 
setting. An anthracycline-cyclophosphamide-taxane-containing regimen is the most widely 
recommended chemotherapy regimen in the ne oadjuvant setting for patien ts with ER+, HER2- BC
in national and international guidelines.
7,8,9The doses of the individual chemotherapy agents in 
this study are consistent with th e national and international guidelines.
The choice among various anthracycline-taxane-ba sed regimens is often a matter of toxicity and 
duration. Within sequential regimens, weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) was shown to have improved 
DFS and OS compared with 3-weekly paclitaxel.112,113In addition, more frequent administration 
of the AC component (ie, dose-dense approach) was shown to be more effective in minimizing 
residual tumor burden than dose-escalation.114In a meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled 
trials, dose-dense chemotherapy improved OS by 16% [hazard ratio (HR), 0.84[95% CI, 0.72-0.98]; p = 0.03] and DFS by 17% (HR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.73-0.94]; p = 0.005).
115
The superiority of dose-dense chemotherapy, in terms of improved long-ter m clinical outcome for 
patients with primary BC, has been recently demonstrated by an individual patient-level data 
meta-analysis, pooling data from more than 37,000 individual patients. Importantly, the 
proportional reductions in recurrence with dose-intense chemotherapy were similar and highly 
significant (p < 0.0001) in both ER+ and ER- disease and did not differ significantly by other 
patient or tumor characteristics.47
Nivolumab 360 mg Q3W infused over approximately 30 minutes will be examined in combination with paclitaxel 80 mg/m
2QW for a maximum 4 cycles (1 cycle = 3 weeks), followed 
by either:
•Nivolumab 360 mg Q3W infused over approximately 30 minutes in combination with either
doxorubicin 60 mg/m2or epirubicin 90 mg/m2and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2Q3W for a
maximum of 4 cycles (1 cycle = 3 weeks); or
•Nivolumab 240 mg Q2W infused over approximately 30 minutes in combination with either
doxorubicin 60 mg/m2or epirubicin 90 mg/m2and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2Q2W for a
maximum of 4 cycles (1 cycle = 2 weeks).

5.5.3 Justification for Dose of Endocrine Therapy
Adjuvant ET is the cornerstone of tr eatment for patients with primary ER+, HER2- BC. Use of 
tamoxifen and/or an AI (anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane) are recommended agents for 
patients with ER+, HER2- BC in national and international guidelines.7,8,9,52The doses of the 
individual ET agents in this study are consistent with the national and international guidelines. 
Investigator’s choice of ET is permitted from the following options:
•Tamoxifen 20 mg per os (by mouth; PO) quaque die (once daily; QD)
•Anastrozole 1 mg PO QD
•Letrozole 2.5 mg PO QD
•Exemestane 25 mg PO QD
Investigator’s choice of the a bove ET options will be examined in combination with nivolumab 
480 mg Q4W in this study.

6.4 Screen Failures
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but who 
are not subsequently randomized in the study /included in the analy sis population. A min imal set 
of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure 
participants, to meet the Consolidated Standards of Re porting Trials (CONSORT) publishing 
requirements, as applicable, and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal 
information includes date of consent, demogra phy, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and

6.4.1 Retesting During Screening
Participant Re-enrollment: This study permits the re-enrollment of a participant that has 
discontinued the study as a pretr eatment failure (i e, participant has not been randomized/has not 
been treated). If re-enrolled, the participant must be re-consented.
Retesting of laboratory parameters and/or othe r assessments within any single Screening w ill be 
permitted (in addition to any parameters that require a confirmatory value).The most current result prior to randomization is the value by which study inclusion will be 
assessed, as it represents the participant’s most current, clinical state.
Laboratory parameters and/or assessments that are included in Table 2-1 (Screening Procedural 
Outline) may be repeated in an effort to find all possible well-qualified participants. Consultation 
with the Medical Monitor (or designee) may be needed to identify whether repeat testing of any 
particular parameter is clinically relevant.
Testing for asymptomatic COVID-19 (eg, by revers e transcription polymerase chain reaction 
[RT-PCR] or viral antigen) is not required. However, some participants may develop suspected or 
confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 or be discovered to have asymptomatic COVID-19 during the screening period. In such cases, participants may be considered eligible for the study after meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria r elated to active infection and after meeting the following criteria:
•At least 10 days (20 days for severe/critical illness)  have passed since symptoms first appeared
or positive RT-PCR or viral antigen test result.
•At least 24 hours have passed since last fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.
•Acute symptoms (eg, cough, shortness of breath) have resolved.
•In the opinion of the Investigator and in consultation with the Medical Monitor or Study
Director, ther e are no COVID-19-related sequ elae (eg, cardiovascular) that may place the
participant at a higher risk of receiving investigational treatment.
•Negative follow-up SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR or viral antigen test based on institutional, local,or regional guidelines.

An IP, also known as an IMP in some regions, is defined as a pharmaceut ical form of an active 
substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical study, including products 
already with a marketing authorization but used or assembled (formulated or packaged) differently 
than the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further 
information about the authorized form.
Consider, if possible, avoiding overlap of administration of vaccine and protocol therapy (eg, at 
least 2 days, preferably 7 days, apart).
Other medications used as support or escape medication for preventative, dia gnostic, or therapeutic 
reasons, as components of the SOC for a given diagnosis, may be considered as non-IPs.Premedications or medications used to  treat infusion-related reactions s hould be sourced by the 
investigative sites, if available a nd permitted by local regulations.
Solutions used as diluent or placebo (ie, 0.9% sodium chloride in jection, 5% de xtrose injecti on) 
should also be sourced by investigative sites, i f available and permitted by local regulations.

7.1.1 Nivolumab/Nivolumab Placebo Dosing
The study design requires a total of 8 cycles of neoadjuvant tr eatment with nivolumab or 
nivolumab placebo in combination with anthracycline-taxane-based chemotherapy, followed by 
7 cycles of adjuvant treatment with nivolumab + Investigator’s choice of ET or Investigator’s 
choice of ET alone (per Protocol Amendment 03).
There will be no dose escalations or reductions of nivolumab or nivolumab placebo allowed. If at 
a particular cycle, nivolumab or nivolumab placebo cannot be administered within a ±3-day 
window from the scheduled chemotherapy dose, nivolumab or nivolumab placebo administration 
must be omitted for that cycle.
•Participants may be dosed no less than 12 da ys from the previous dose during Q2W cycles.
•Participants may be dosed no less than 18 days from the previous dose during Q3W cycles.
•Participants may be dosed no less than 25 days from the previous dose during Q4W cycles.
Premedications are not recommended for the first dose of nivolumab or nivolumab placebo. 
Premedication with corticosteroi ds should be avoide d. However, if considered clinically 
necessary, premedication with corticosteroids can be  used in accordance wi th the local treatment 
guidelines.
Participants should be carefully monitored f or infusion reactions  during nivolumab or nivolumab 
placebo administration. If an  acute infusion reaction is noted, participants s hould be managed 
according to Section 7.4.1.3 (Treatment of Nivolumab Infusion Reaction).

Doses of nivolumab or nivolumab placebo may be interrupted, delayed, omitted, or discontinued,
depending on how well the participant toler ates the treatment. For additional information, please 
see Sections 7.4.1 (Dose Modifications for Nivolumab), Section 7.4.1.2 (Criteria to Resume 
Treatment with Nivolumab) and Section 8.1.1 (Nivolumab Dose Discontinuation). Instructions for 
dilution and infusion of nivolumab or nivolumab  placebo injection may be provided in the clinical 
protocol, pharmacy manual, or pharmacy reference sheet.  Care must be taken to assure sterility of 
the prepared solution, as the product does not contain any an timicrobial preservative or 
bacteriostatic agent.
7.1.2 Neoadjuvant (Pre-surgery) Phase
During the Neoadjuvant (Pre-surgery) Phase, when given in combination with chemotherapy,
nivolumab or nivolumab placebo is to be given first. Nivolumab or nivolumab placebo must be 
given on the same day as the assigned chemotherapy. Nivolumab or nivolumab placebo infusion must be promptly followed by a saline flush to clear the line per local standards. Separate infusion bags and filters should be used when administering nivolumab or nivolumab placebo and assigned
chemotherapy as per local standards. Do not  co-administer othe r drugs through the same 
intravenous line. Chemotherapy starts after the infusion line has been flushed, filters changed, and 
the participant has been observed for approximately 30 minutes, to ensure no infusion reaction has 
occurred.
Participants should receive neoadjuvant nivolumab or nivolumab placebo at a dose of 360 mg 
infusion given over approximately 30 minutes on Day 1 of each tr eatment cycle (Q3W), for a 
maximum of 8 cycles, until disease worsening or disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, neoadjuvant treatment is completed, death, the study ends, or Q4W dosing 
begins, whichever occurs first. If needed, flush the intravenous line with an appropriate amount of 
diluent (eg, 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose in w ater to ensure that the complete dose is 
administered over approximately 30 minutes).
In cases where a dose-dense regimen of AC is administered Q2W, nivolumab or nivolumab 
placebo will also be administered on a Q2W schedule. Participants s hould receive nivolumab or 
nivolumab placebo at a dose of  240 mg i nfusion give n over approx imately 30 minutes on Day 1 
of each tr eatment cycle, until disease worsening or disease progression, un acceptable toxicity, 
withdrawal of consent, neoadjuvant treatment is completed, death, the study ends, or Q4W dosing begins, whichever occurs first.
7.1.3 Adjuvant (Post-surgery) Phase
As of Protocol Amendment 03, treatment in the Adjuvant phase will be open label. Participants 
who are randomized to Arm B will no t receive adjuvant nivolumab pl acebo infusions, only 
Investigator’s choice of ET (per Protocol Amendment 03). 
Participants will follow pre vious randomization and will r eceive nivolumab with Investigator’s 
choice of ET or Investigat or’s choice of ET alone (per Prot ocol Amendment 03) as adjuvant 
treatment.

Participants will r eceive paclitaxel at a dose of 80 mg/m
2over a minimum of 60 minutes as an
intravenous (IV) i nfusion or per institutional po licy on Day 1, Day 8, and Day 15 of each 3-week 
treatment cy cle. Paclitaxel will be administered for PTX Cycles 1-4 until disease worsening or 
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, PTX Cycles 1-4 are completed, 
death, or the study ends, whichever occurs first.
Dosing calculations should be based on the body surface area calculation. The dose should remain 
the same if the participant’s weight is within 10% of the weight used to calculate the previous dose. All doses should be rounded to the nearest milligram or per institutional standards. All participants should be carefully monitored for i nfusion reactions during the p aclitaxel 
administration.
Participants should be treated in a facility with the nece ssary medical-resusci tation equipment and 
medications on hand to manage se rious acute infusion reactions.
Paclitaxel premedication with corticosteroids should be avoided, if clinically justifiable. However, 
if considered clinically necessary or in acc ordance with the local  treatment guidelines, 
premedication with corticosteroids can be used. Corticosteroids can be administered after the 
observation period of approximately 30 minutes following nivolumab.
Doses of paclitaxel may be interrupted, delayed, reduced, or discontinued, depending on how well 
the participant tolerates the treatment. For additional information, please see Section 7.4.2.1 (Dose 
Delay for Paclitaxel Therapy), Section 7.4.2.2 (Dose Reductions for Paclitaxel Chemotherapy), 
Section 7.4.2.3 (Criteria to Resume Treatment with Paclitaxel Chemotherapy), and Section 8.1.2
(Chemotherapy Dose Discontinuation). Participants may be dosed no less than 6 days from the previous dose of paclitaxel.
Every effort should be made to administer a total of 4 cycles of paclitaxel chemotherapy in 
combination with nivolumab or nivolumab placebo.
7.1.4.2 Anthracycline and Cyclophosphamide

7.2 Method of Treatment Assignment
Before the study is init iated, each user will receive log-in information and directions on how to 
access the IRT. Each participant will be assigned a unique participant number after signing the 
ICF. Participant numbers will be used on all participants’ study information. Participant numbers will not be reassigned. An IRT will be employe d to manage participant randomization. The 
Investigator or designee will register the par ticipant for enrollment by following the enrollment 
procedures established by the Sponsor.
The following information is required for enrollment:
•Date that informed consent was obtained
•Year of birth
•Gender at birth
Once enrolled in IRT, enrolled participants who have met all eligibility criteria will be ready to be 
randomized through the IRT. The following infor mation is required for participant randomization:
•Participant number
•Year of birth
•Gender at birth (female or male)
•ER status/expression levels tumor type
•PD-L1 on immune cells ( ≥ 1% or < 1%)
•Tumor grade (2 or 3)
•Axillary nodal status (patholog ical review positive versus radiographic and/or pathologic 
review negative)
•AC dose-frequency regimen (Q3W or Q2W)
The exact procedures for using the IRT will be detailed in the IRT manual.

7.3 Blinding
This is a randomized, double-blinded study. Access to treatment codes will be restricted from all 
participants and site and Sponsor personnel prior to each interim and final database lock, with 
exceptions as specified below.
Each investigative site must assign an unblinde d pharmacist or designee, and an unblinded site 
monitor will be assigned by the Sponsor to provide oversight of drug supply and other unblinded 
study documentation.
Blinding of treatment assignment is critical to the integrity of this clinical study. However, in the 
event of a medical emergency or pregnancy in an  individual participant, in which knowledge of 
the IP is critical to th e participant's management, the blind for that participant may be broken by 
the Investigator. The participant’s safety takes priority over any other considerations in determining if a treatment assignment should be unblinded.
Before breaking the blind of an indi vidual participant's treatment, the Investigator should 
determine that the unblinded information is necessary (ie, that it w ill alter the par ticipant's 
immediate management). In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not related to 
the IP, the problem may be properly managed by assuming that the participant is receiving active product. It is highly desirable that the decision to unblind treatment assignment be discussed with the Medical Monitor (or designee), but the Investig ator always has the ultimate authority for the 
decision to unblind. The Principal Investigator or appoi nted designee s hould only c all in for 
emergency unblinding AFTER the decision to unblind the participant has been documented.
For this study, the method of unblinding for emergency purposes is through the IRT. Refer to the IRT manual for details.
In the case of an emergency, the Investigat or(s) has unrestricted access to randomization 
information via the IRT and is capable of breaki ng the blind through the IRT system without prior 
approval from the Spons or. Following the unblinding, the Investigator sh all notify the Med ical 
Monitor and/or Study Director (or designee). A fter emergency unblinding through the IRT, 
participant will be discontinued from study treatment and move to safety follow-up phase.
In cases of accidental unblinding, contact the Medical Monitor (or designee) and ensure that every 
attempt is made to preserve the blind.
Any request to unblind a participant for non-eme rgency purposes should be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor (or designee). Non-emergency unb linding will be requested by the Principal 
Investigator or appointed designee upon approval by the Medical Monitor. The latter w ill start 
internal process (outside of IRT system) to unblind the participants’ treatment. The unblinded 
participant continues to receive the ra ndomized study tr eatment.
With Protocol Amendment 03, treatment assi gnment remains blinded through the Neoadjuvant
and Surgical phases. When participants enter the Adjuvant phase, treatment assignment w ill be 
open label to both the Sponsor and the study sites. For participants entering the Adjuvant phase or 
already in the Adjuvant or Follow-up phases at the time Protocol Amendment 03 is approved,

treatment assignment w ill be provided. Treatment assignment w ill only be provided after the 
pathological response information is entered in the CRF.
Designated staff of BMS Research & Development (R&D) may be unblinded (obtain the 
randomization codes) prior to d atabase lock to facilitate the bioanalytical analysis of PK samples 
and immunogenicity. A bioanalytical scientist in the Bioanalytical Sciences department of 
BMS R&D (or a designee in the external central bioanalyti cal laboratory) will be unblinded to 
(may obtain) the randomized tr eatment assignments in order to min imize unnece ssary 
bioanalytical analysis of samples from control group participants.
The pharmacist at the site and/or designee will be unblinded to the randomized tr eatment 
assignments in order to prepare blinded study treatment from bulk supplies, as needed. This (these) 
individual(s) will be unblinded to study drug identification but will not be involved in any other 
aspect of study conduct.
7.4 Dosage Modification
When assessing AEs, the Investigator must assign drug causality to each study drug for each AE. 
If a reasonable determination cannot be made, then the AE should be considered related to each of 
the study drugs. IO agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severity and duration from 
AEs caused by other therapeutic classes.
Recommendations for dose reducti on, delay, interruption, or discontinuation of individual study 
drugs in the management of study drug-related adverse reactions are summarized below. For 
additional information, please refer to indivi dual drug labels. Clinical judgment of the treating 
physician should guide the management plan of each participant based on individual benefit-risk 
assessment. However, for events requiring a discontinuation, treatment must be discontinued. Any 
changes to the dose must be recorded on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF).
7.4.1 Dose Modifications for Nivolumab
Participants who require a dose delay for ni volumab or nivolumab placebo should be re-evaluated 
and resume treatment at the next cycle or within ±3 days from scheduled chemotherapy dose when 
retreatment criteria are met. AE criteria for delaying, resuming, and discontinuing of study treatment 
is provided in Table 7.4.1-1.

7.4.1.1 Dose Delay Criteria for Nivolumab
Nivolumab administration should be delayed for the following:
•For participants receiving nivolumab, dose d elay criteria apply for all drug-related AEs
(regardless of) whether the event is attributed to nivolumab. Delay administration of nivolumab
if any of the delay criteria in Table 7.4.1-1 are met. Delay nivolumab dosing for any AE,
laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the investigator,
warrants delaying the dose of study medication.
•Study treatment must also be delayed for SARS-CoV-2 infections, either confirmed or
suspected.
•For participants who require delay of nivolumab reevaluate weekly, or more frequently if
clinically indicated, and resume nivolumab dosi ng when the retreatment criteria are met (see
Table 7.4.1-1 ). Continue tumor assessment per protocol, even if dosing is delayed.
The other study treatments may still be administered.
7.4.1.2 Criteria to Resume Treatment with Nivolumab
•Participants may resume treatment with study treatment following Table 7.4.1-1 .
•Participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection (either confirmed or suspected) may resume
treatment after all of the following:
•At least 10 days (20 days for severe/critical illness) have passed since symptoms first appeared
or positive test result (eg, RT-PCR or viral antigen); and
•Resolution of acute symptoms (including at leas t 24 hours has passed since last fever without
fever reducing medications); and
•Evaluation by the Investigator with confirmation that there are no sequelae that would placethe participant at a higher risk of receiving investigational treatment; and
•Consultation with the Medical Monitor. For susp ected cases, treatment may also resume if
SARS-CoV-2 infection is ruled out and other criteria to resume treatment are met.
Participants with drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic 
hormone repl acement may resume treatment after consu ltation with the Medical Monitor 
(or designee). Adrenal insufficiency requires disc ontinuation, regardless of control with hormone 
replacement.
7.4.1.3 Treatment of Nivolumab Infusion Reaction
Since nivolumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequences, it is unlikely to be 
immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitivity reactions. However, if such a reaction were 
to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritus, arthralgia, hypotension, hypertension, bronchospasm, or other allergic-like reactions. All Grade 3 or 4 
infusion r eactions s hould be reported within 24 hours to the study Med ical Monitor (or designee)
and reported as an SAE, if it meets the criteria. Infusion reactions should be graded according to

guidelines.
Treatment recommendations are provided below based on CTCAE v5.0 and may be modified 
based on local treatment standards and guidelines, as appropriate:For Grade 1 symptoms (mild reaction; i nfusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated):
•Remain at bedside and monitor participant until recovery from symptoms. The following
prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions : diphenhydramine 50 mg
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg, at least 30 minutes beforesubsequent nivolumab/nivolumab placebo administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms (moderate reaction required therapy or infusion interruption but responds 
promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihis tamines, non-steroidal anti-inf lammatory drugs, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic medications indicated for 
≤24 hours):
•Stop the study drug i nfusion, begin an IV infusio n of normal saline, and tr eat the participant
with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol
325 to 1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor participant un til resolution of symptoms.
Corticosteroid and/or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered, as appropriate. If the
infusion is interrupted, then restart the i nfusion at 50% of the original infusion r ate when
symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after approximately 30 minutes, the ratemay be increased to 100% of the original infus ion rate. Monitor the participant closely. If
symptoms recur, then no further study medication will be administered at that visit.
•For future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications are recommended:
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) a nd/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg
should be administered at least 30 minutes before nivolumab/nivolumab placebo i nfusions.
If necessary, corticosteroids (up to 25 mg of hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used.
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms (severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapidly responsive to 
symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of  infusion]; recurrence of symptoms following 
initial improv ement; hospi talization ind icated for other clinical sequelae [eg, renal impairment, 
pulmonary infiltrates]; Grade 4: Life threaten ing; pressor or ventilatory support indicated):
•Immediately discontinue infusion of study d rug. Begin an IV i nfusion of normal saline and
treat the participant as follows: Recommend bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a
1:1000 solution for subcutaneous administr ation or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution
injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV withmethylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Participant should be monitored
until the Investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Study drug w ill be
permanently discontinued. Investigators should fol low their institutional guidelines for the
treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at be dside and monitor the participant un til recovery of the
symptoms.

7.4.2 Dose Modifications for Chemotherapy
Recommendations for dose reducti on, delay, interruption, or discontinuation of individual study 
drugs in the management of study drug-related adverse reactions are summarized below.
Participants who require a dose delay for chemotherapy s hould be re-evaluated and resume 
treatment at the next cycle, when retreatment criteria are met. For participants who meet criteria to  delay chemot herapy (paclitaxel, doxorubicin or epirubicin, 
or cyclophosphamide), the corresponding drug will be delayed and nivolumab or nivolumab 
placebo will also be delayed in an effort to maintain synchronization of the combination regimen.
Efforts to maintain dose intensity and the intended treatment schedule are recommended.
7.4.2.1 Dose Delay for Paclitaxel Therapy
It is permissible, in cases of a dose held due to AEs, to omit the dose in the cycle in order to 
re-synchronize the participant with the next cycle visit.
Chemotherapy delay should not ex ceed 6 weeks. In the event that tr eatment with chemotherapy 
needs to be delayed beyond 6 weeks due to toxicity, a participant may continue on study to receive 
neoadjuvant AC study treatment at an earlier timepoint, or may transition to the Adjuvant (Post-surgery) Phase at an earlier timepoint. Such treatment decisions will be at the discretion of the Investigator and participant, and upon consultation with the Medical Monitor (or designee).
Paclitaxel should be delayed for the following:
•Presence of febrile neutropenia or neutropenia < 1000 cells/mm3for > 1 week, despite the use
of growth factors.
•Platelets < 100,000/mm3.
•Any Grade ≥2 neuropathy (sensory or motor).
•Any Grade ≥2 non-skin, chemotherapy-related AE, except for alopecia, fatigue, or laboratory
abnormalities.
•Any Grade 3 skin chemotherapy-related AE.
•Any Grade 3 chemotherapy-related laboratory abnorm ality, with the following exceptions:
−Grade 3 lymphopenia does not require a dose delay.
−Delay if total bilirubin > 1 ×ULN or if AST and/or ALT > 1.5 ×ULN occurs concomitant
with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) > 2.5 ×ULN.
•Any AE, laboratory abnorm ality, or inter-c urrent illness which, in the judgment of the
Investigator, warrants omitting the dose of study medication.

Subsequent dose reductions may be required, per Section 7.4.2.2 (Dose Reductions for Paclitaxel 
Chemotherapy). Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; ie, filgrastim or pegfilgrastim) or 
human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) treatment is permitted for 
participants receiving chemotherapy and is required during the AC portion of chemotherapy if 
given as Q2W dose-dense regimen.9,118Such primary prophylaxis should be administered per the 
ASCO, European Organisation for the Research  and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) or European 
Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines, or per local standard pr actice for all 
participants receiving ddAC chemotherapy. Participants may receive growth factors (including 
G[M]-CSF and erythropoietin) at the discretion of the Investigator, in accordance with institutional 
and/or current ASCO guidelines for secondary prophylaxis.
A dose given more than 3 days after the intended dose date will be considered a dose delay. Longer 
delays may be allowed following discussion with the Medical Monitor (or designee).
7.4.2.2 Dose Reductions for Paclitaxel Chemotherapy
The full dose of paclitaxel is 80 mg/m2. This dose may be reduced by 1 dose level to 65 mg/m2
and subsequently by 1 more dose level to 52 mg/m2. In the case of any toxicity requiring more 
than 2 dose reductions, paclitaxel must be discontinued, unless the participant is benefitting from 
therapy.
Any participant experiencing the following toxicities described below (see Table 7.4.2.2-1 ) may 
have the paclitaxel dose reduced by 1 dose level for all subsequent cycles.

within the paclitaxel prescribing information.
•Participants with combined Grade 2 AST/ALT AND total bilirubin values meeting discontinuation parameters ( Section 8.1.2 [Chemotherapy Dose Discontinuation]) should have 
treatment permanently discontinued.
Participants that meet retreatment criteria for th e chemotherapy, but have not yet met retreatment 
criteria for nivolumab or nivolumab placebo, are to receive the chemotherapy alone and delay 
nivolumab or nivolumab placebo ( Secti on 7.4.1.1 Dose Delay Criteria for Nivolumab).
7.4.2.4 Dose Delay for Anthracycline and Cyclophosphamide Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy delay should not ex ceed 6 weeks. In the event that tr eatment with chemotherapy

The full dose of doxorubicin is 60 mg/m2and that of cyclophosphamide is 600 mg/m2. Doses of 
anthracycline and cyclophosphamide may be reduced  jointly or stopped, depending on the toxicity 
(Table 7.4.2.5-1 ). Growth factors, such as G-CSF or GM-CSF, may be used at the discretion of 
the Investigators, in accordance with institutional and/or current ASCO guidelines; per such 
guidelines, G-CSF or GM-CSF support is cons idered SOC for patients undergoing ddAC 
chemotherapy, as primary prophylaxis. However, recurrence of neutrope nia despite adequate 
growth factor support would allow dose reduction in addition to growth factor support.
A maximum of 2 AC dose reductions are permitted; if additional reductions are required, that 
particular study drug must be discontinued. Once a dose has been decreased, it should remain reduced for all subsequent dosing, unless the dose is further reduced. No dose escalations w ill be

indicated.
•Participants may resume treatment with cyclophosphamide when the ANC returns to 
≥1500/mm3, the platelet count returns to ≥50,000/mm3, severe infections have improved to 
≤Grade 1, and all other drug-related tox icities have returned to baseline or Grade ≤1 
(or Grade ≤2 for alopecia and fatigue).
−If a participant fails to meet criteria for reinit iating treatment, then th e treatment should be 
delayed and the participant should be re-evaluated weekly or more frequently, as clinically 
indicated.
−Participants that meet retreatment criteria for the chemotherapy, but have not yet met 
retreatment criteria for nivolumab or nivolumab placebo, are to receive the chemotherapy alone and delay nivolumab or nivolumab placebo until the subsequent chemotherapy 
treatment.

baseline and throughout st udy Treatment Period and Follow-up Period in the a ppropriate section 
of the eCRF at each visit.
All medications (prescription and over-th e-counter [OTC]), vi tamin and mineral s upplements, 
and/or herbs taken by the participant, from th e Screening Period through the Follow-up Period,
will be documented and rec orded, including start and stop date, dose and route of administration, 
frequency, and indication. Medications taken for a procedure (eg, biopsy) should also be included.ET therapy taken after completion of the Adjuvant (Post-surgery) Phase, will be collected as 
concomitant medication.
Prior anti-cancer treatments will be recorde d during the Screening Period and documented on the 
appropriate eCRF. Any subsequent anti- cancer therapy will be recorded un til end of study or death, 
in the appropriate section of the eCRF.
7.7.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments
7.7.1.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments for NivolumabThe following medications are prohibited during study treatment (unless utilized to tr eat a drug-

7.7.1.2 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments for Chemotherapy and 
Endocrine Therapy
The following medications not already specified in the protocol are prohibited  and/or restricted 
during the study tr eatment. Medications taken within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration 
must be recorded on the eCRF.
•Anticancer agents: No additional investigational or commercial anticancer agents 
(ie, chemotherapy, CDK4/6 inhibitors, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, extensive, non-
palliative radiation therapy, radiation therapy in the neoadjuvant setting, or standard or 
investigational agents for treatment of BC) ot her than those specified in the protocol will be 
permitted during the stud y treatment. In gener al, any drugs containing “for the treatment of 
breast cancer” on th e product insert are not permitted during the study tr eatment. Use of 
megestrol acetate as an appetite stimulant is not permitted.
•Investigational agents: Exposure to any investigational drug or placebo within 4 weeks of 
prior study drug administration or during the study treatment.
•Hormonal agents: Concurrent use of an oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal 
contraceptive agent.
•OTC Agents: No concomitant  medications (prescription, OTC, or herbal) are to be 
administered during the study tr eatment, unless they are prescribed for treatment of specific 
clinical events. Any concomitant therapies must be recorded on the eCRF.
•Other prohibited and/or restricted treatments:
−Co-administration of letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane with other anti-est rogens or 
estrogens should be avoided.
−Co-administration of tamoxifen with potent cytochrome p-450 (CYP)2D6 inhibitors 
(eg, paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine, cinacalcet, bupropion) should be avoided.
−Co-administration of paclitaxel with known inducers of either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (eg, rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, efavirenz, nevirapine) is not recommended.
−Stop cimetidine during tr eatment with epirubicin.
−Neither doxorubicin n or epirubicin s hould be administered with other cardiotoxic agents 
or other cardioactive co mpounds (eg, calcium channel bloc kers), unless the participant’s
cardiac function is closely monitored.
−Cyclophosphamide is inactive, but is metabolised in the liver, mainly by CYP2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A4, into tw o active metabolites. Planne d co-administration or sequential 
administration of other substances or treatments with cyclophosphamide that could increase the likelihood or severity of toxi c effects (by means of pharmacodynamic or 
pharmacokinetic interactions) requires careful individual assessment of the expected benefit and the risks (eg, CYP2B6 inducers such as rifampicin, efavirenz and nevirapine; 
CYP2C9 inducers such as carbamazepine, and rifampicin, and CYP3A4 inhibitors such as 
ketoconazole, clarithromycin, itraconazole, r itonavir, nelfinavir, and saquinavir).
−Vaccination with a live vaccine should be av oided in participants receiving doxorubicin or 
epirubicin.

7.7.2.1 Imaging Restriction and Precautions
It is the local imaging fa cility’s respons ibility to determine, based on par ticipant attributes 
(eg, allergy history, diabetic history, and renal status), the appropriate imaging modality and 
contrast regimen per imaging study. Imaging contr aindications and contrast risks are to be 
considered in this assessment. Participants with renal insufficiency are to be assessed as to whether or not they should receive contrast and, if so, which contrast agent and dose is appropriate. Specific 
to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), participants with severe renal insufficiency (ie, estimated 
glomerular filtration r ate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m
2) are at increased risk of nephrogenic 
systemic fibrosis; therefore, MRI contrast is cont raindicated. In addition, participants may be 
excluded from MRI if they have tattoos, metallic implants, pacemakers, etc. This will be outlined 
in the Imaging Manual.
Gentle hydration before and after IV contrast should follow local SOC. The ultimate decision to 
perform MRI in an individual participant in this study rests with the site radiologist, the Investigator, and standards set by the local IEC.
7.7.3 Permitted Therapy
Participants are permitted the use of topical, oc ular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorpti on). Adrenal rep lacement steroid doses > 10 mg 
daily prednisone are permitted. A brief (less-th an-3-weeks) course of corticosteroids for 
prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions 
(eg, delayed-type hypersensitivity r eaction caused by a contact allergen) is permitted.
Participants receiving the dose-dense administration of AC must receive G-CSF or GM-CSF
prophylaxis per international guidelines. In addition, men and premenopausal women may receive 
concurrent luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist using an approved dose or as 
per local standard for these agents. Participan ts may receive a bisphosphonate using an approved 
dose or as per local standard for these agents.

7.8 Treatment After the End of the Study
At the end of the study, BMS will not continue to p rovide BMS-supplied study treatment to 
participants/Investigators, unle ss BMS chooses to exte nd the study. The Investigator should ensure 
that the participant receives appropriate SOC to treat the condition under study.
BMS reserves the right to terminate access to BMS-supplied study treatment if any of the following 
occur:
•The study is terminated due to safety concerns.
•The development of nivolumab is terminated fo r other reasons, includi ng, but not limited to,
lack of efficacy and/or not meeting the study objectives.
•The participant can obtain medication from a government-s ponsored or private h ealth program.
In all cases, BMS will follow local regulations.
8 DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA
Reasons for discontinuation of treatment or from the study are given below. Participants are 
expected to complete 8 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy, undergo definitive surgery, and comp lete 
7 cycles of adjuvant therapy, except in the event of disease progression that precludes definitive 
surgery, local or distant recurrence, sec ond primary malignancy, death, unacceptable toxicity,
symptomatic deterioration, Investigator’s decision to discontinue treatment, start of subsequent 
cancer treatment, the participant’s decision to discontinue treatment or withdraw consent, the 
participant being lost to follow-up, or if the Sponsor terminates the study.
8.1 Discontinuation from Study Treatment
Participants MUST discontinue IP (and non-IP at the discretion of the Investigator) for any of the 
following reasons:
•Participant’s request to stop study tr eatment. Par ticipants who request to discontinue study
treatment will remain in the study and must continue to be followed for protocol-specified
follow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a participant specifically withdraws
consent for any further contact with h im/her or persons previously  authorized by the par ticipant
to provide this information (see Section 8.2 [Discontinuation from the Study]).
•Any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the opinion of theInvestigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best interest of the
participant.
•Termination of the study by BMS.
•Loss of ability to fr eely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily incarceration
for treatment of eith er a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious di sease) illness.  (Note: Under
specific circumstances, and only in countries where local regulations permit, a participant who
has been imprisoned may be permitted to continue  as a participant. Strict conditions apply and
BMS approval is required.)
•In the case of pregnancy, the Investigator must immediately, within 24 hours of awareness of
the pregnancy, notify the Medical Monitor (or design ee) of this event. In most cases, the study
treatment w ill be permanently discontinued in an a ppropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if

necessary for participant safety). See Section 9.2.6 (Pregnancy). For additional details on 
country specific requirements, refer to Appendix 9. 
•Occurrence of an EFS event. See Section 9.1.2 (Definition of Event-free Survival) for details.
•Disease progression. See Section 9.1.2 (Definition of Event-free Survival) for details.
•See Section 8.1.1 for Nivolumab Discontinuation criteria.
•Start of subsequent cancer treatment, including abemaciclib, during the Adjuvant phase.
•Emergency unblinding prior to the Adjuvant phase.
All participants who discontinue study treatment shoul d comply with protocol-specified
procedures, as outlined in Section 2 (Schedule of Activities) and Section 7 (Treatment). The only 
exception to this requirement is when a parti cipant withdraws consent for all study procedures (see 
Section 8.2 [Discontinuation from the Study]), including post-treatment study follow-up, or loses 
the ability to consent freely (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the tr eatment of 
either a psychiatric or physical illness).
If study treatment is discontinued prior to the participant’s completion of the study, the reason for 
the discontinuation must be documented in th e participant’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate eCRF page.
8.1.1 Nivolumab Dose Discontinuation
Nivolumab treatment s hould be permanently discontinued if meets criteria for discontinuation in 
Table 7.4.1-1 .
•Any event that leads to delay in dosing lasting > 8 weeks with the Q3W schedule or > 6 weeks 
with the Q2W schedule in the Neoadjuvant (Pre-surgery) Phase, or > 10 weeks with the Q4W 
schedule in the Adjuvant (Post-surgery) Phase, from the previous dose requires 
discontinuation, with the following exceptions:
−Dosing delays to allow for prolonged steroid tap ers to manage drug-related AEs are 
allowed.
−Dosing delays lasting > 8 weeks with the Q3W schedule, > 6 weeks with the Q2W 
schedule, or > 10 weeks with the Q4W schedule from the previous dose that occur for 
non-drug-related reasons may be allowed if approved by the Medical Monitor 
(or designee).
♦Prior to re-initiating treatment in a participant with a dosing delay lasting > 8 weeks
with the Q3W schedule, > 6 weeks with the Q2W schedule, or > 10 weeks with the Q4W schedule, the Medical Monitor (or designee) must be consulted.
♦Tumor assessments should continue per protocol, even if dosing is delayed. Periodic study visits to assess safety and laboratory studies should also continue every 6 weeks,
or more frequently if clinically indicated during such dosing delays.
•Any AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness that, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the participant with continued nivolumab 
dosing.

•The underlying reason(s) for any instance of study treatment discontinuation should be
documented in the eCRF.
8.1.2 Chemotherapy Dose Discontinuation
If unacceptable toxicities related to paclitaxel occur, as determined by Investigator judgment and 
in accordance with the prescribing informatio n, paclitaxel may be discontinued, but other study 
treatments may be continued. For example, a pa rticipant may continue on study to receive 
neoadjuvant AC study treatment at an earlier t imepoint, or may transition to the Adjuvant 
(Post-surgery) Phase at an earlier time point. Such treatment decisions w ill be at the discretion of 
the Investigator and participant, and upon consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor 
(or designee).
If unacceptable toxicities related to doxorubicin or epirubicin and/or cyclophosphamide occur, as 
determined by Investigator judgment and in accordance with the prescribing information, doxorubicin or ep irubicin and/or cyclophosphamide may be discontinued, but other st udy 
treatments may be continued. For example, a pa rticipant may transition to the Adjuvant 
(Post-surgery) Phase at an earlier time point. Such treatment decisions w ill be at the discretion of 
the Investigator and participant, and upon consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor (or designee).
The underlying reason(s) for any instance of study treatment discontinuation should be 
documented in the eCRF.8.1.3 Endocrine Therapy Dose Discontinuation
If unacceptable toxicities related to the Inves tigator’s choice of ET occur, as determined by 
Investigator judgment and in accordance with the prescribing information, the Investigator’s 
choice of ET may be discontinued, but the other study treatments may be continued.
The underlying reason(s) for any instance of study treatment discontinuation should be 
documented in the eCRF.
8.1.4 Post-study Treatment Study Follow-up
In this study, pCR is a key endpoint of the study. Post-study follow-up is of critical importance 
and is essential to preserving participant safety and the integrity of the study. Participants who 
discontinue study treatment must continue to be followed (in this study or a rollover study) for collection of outcome and/or survival follow-up data, as required and in line with Section 5 (Study 
Design) and Section 8.1 (Discontinuation from Study Treatment), until death or the conclusion of 
the study.
8.2 Discontinuation from the Study
Participants who request to discontinue study treatment will remain in the study and must continue 
to be followed for protocol-specified follow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a 
participant specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with  him/her or persons 
previously authorized by participant to provide this information.

•Participants should notify the Investigato r of the decision to withdraw consent from future
follow-up in writing, whenever possible.
•The withdrawal of consent should be explained in  detail in the medical rec ords by the
Investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is from further treatment with study tr eatment only
or also from study proce dures and/or post treatment study follow-up, and entered on the
appropriate eCRF page.
•In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured,
publicly available information s hould be used to determine vital status only as appropriately
directed in accordance with local law.
•If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future i nformation, the Sponsor may
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.
8.3 Lost to Follow-up
•All reasonable efforts must be made to  locate participants to determine and re port their ongoing
status. This includes follow-up with persons authorized by the participant.
•Lost to follow-up is defined by the inability  to reach the participant after a minimum of three
documented phone calls, faxes, or emails, as well as lack of response by the participant to one
registered mail letter. All attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical records.
•If it is determined that the participant has died, the site w ill use permissible local met hods to
obtain the date and cause of death.
•If the Investigator’s use of third-party representative to assist in the follow-up portion of the
study has been included in the participant’s informed consent, then the Investigator may use a
Sponsor-retained third-party represe ntative to assist site staff wi th obtaining the participant’s
contact information or other public vital s tatus data n ecessary to complete the follow-up
portion of the study.
•The site staff and representative will consul t publicly available sources, such as public h ealth
registries and databases, in orde r to obtain updated contact information.
•If after all attempts, the participant remains lost to follow-up, then the last known alive date as
determined by the Investigator should be reported and documented in the participant’s medical
records.
9 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
•Study procedures and timing are summarized in the Schedule of Activities ( Section 2 ).
•Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed.
•All immediate safety concerns must be discussed with the Spons or immediately upon
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue
treatment.
•Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of
Activities ( Section 2 ), is essential and required for study conduct.
•All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potentialparticipants meet all eligibility cri teria before randomization. The Investigator w ill maintain a

screening log to record details of all participants sc reened and to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
•Procedures conducted as part of a participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood count)
and obtained before signing of  informed consent may be u tilized for screening or baseline
purposes, provided the procedure meets the protocol-defined criteria and has been performedwithin the timeframe defined in the Schedule of Activities ( Section 2 ).
Additional measures, including non-study-required laboratory tests, should be performed as 
clinically indicated or to comply with local regul ations. Laboratory toxicities (eg, suspected 
drug-induced liver enzyme evaluations) w ill be monitored during the Follow-up Period via 
on-site/local labor atories, until all study drug-related toxicities resolve, ret urn to baseline, or are 
deemed irreversible.
If a participant shows cardiac or pulmonary-rel ated signs (hypoxia, abnormal heart rate or changes 
from baseline) or symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough, chest pain, fatigue, palpitations), the participant 
should be immediately evaluated to rule out cardiac or pulmonary toxicity.
Some of the assessments referred to in this section may not be captured as data on the eCRF. They 
are intended to be used as safety monitoring by the treating physician. Additional testing or 
assessments may be performed as clinically necessary or where required by institutional or local 
regulations.
9.1 Efficacy Assessments
9.1.1 Pathological Assessment of Effect
9.1.1.1 Pathological Complete Response DeterminationThe determination of pCR will be performed by the local pathologist following examination of 
tissue (breast and nodes) removed at the time of surgery.
Criteria for evaluation of pCR includes the following:
•pCR in breast and axillary lymph nodes as well as non-axillary sentinel node (pCR breast and
nodes).
•No histologic evidence of invasive tumor cells in the surgical breast specimen or axillary nodes
after neoadjuvant treatment.
•pCR in the breast (pCR breast).
Tumor and lymph node collection from definitive s urgical resection is mandatory on the day of 
surgery. Tumor sample acquisition guidelines and submission process will be outlined in the study 
Laboratory Manual. Additional details are provided in the Pathology Manual.
9.1.1.2 Residual Cancer Burden Determination
Residual cancer burden (RCB) is estimated from routine pathologic sections of the primary breast 
tumor site and the regional lymph nodes after the completion of neoadjuvant therapy.121
Six variables are included in a calculation formula.

Clinical Protocol CA2097FL
BMS-936558 nivolumab
Local RCB will be assessed from routine pat hologic sections of the pr imary breast tumor site and 
the regional lymph nodes right after surgery . Five variables are included in a 
calculation formula, which include the following:
•The primary tumor bed area in its 2 dimensions. Fo r multifocal tumors (defined as the presence
of 2 or more foci of cancer within the same breast quadrant), the largest lesion must be ≥ 2 cm
and designated as the “target” lesion for the RCB determination.
•The overall cancer cellularity (percentage of area).
•The proportion of in situ di sease (percentage of area).
•The number of positive lymph nodes.
•The diameter of the largest lymph node metastasis.
The calculated RCB index value can also be  categorized as 1 of 4 RCB classes. The calculation 
formula and detailed description can be found at a dedicated website: http://www.mdanderson.org/breastcancer_RCB. The 4 RCB classes are the following:
1) RCB-0: no residual disease
2) RCB-I: min imal residual disease
3) RCB-II: mode rate residual disease
4) RCB-III: extensive residual disease
Detailed procedures are provided in the Pathology Manual.
9.1.2 Definition of Event-free Survival
EFS is defined as the time from ra ndomization to disease progression that precludes definitive 
surgery, results in a local or distant recurrence, results in a second primary malignancy, or results 
in death due to any cause.
The diagnosis of a BC recurrence or second primary tumor s hould be confirmed histologi cally 
whenever clinically feasible. In cases wher e confirmation is not feasible, efforts s hould be made 
to obtain an autopsy report.With respect to timing of an EFS event, the earliest d ate of diagnosis of r ecurrent disease should 
be used and recorded. This date should be ba sed on objective clinical, radiological, histological, 
or cytological evidence. The recurrence of disease should correspond to the date of the first 
diagnosis of lesion (ie, an objective finding), and not to the date of occurrence of the first symptom(eg, a participant presenting with shortness of breath is found to have possible lesions in the lungs on thorax CT scan of uncertain significance). If a subsequent CT scan confirms disease 
progression, the date of the first diagnostic CT scan should be taken as the date of recurrence, and 
not the date of presentation with shortness of breath. The date of disease relapse is the time of first appearance of a suspicious lesion (in a radiologi cal procedure in this example), later proven to be 
a definitive recurrence or metastasis.
Details on EFS events are provided below:

•Worsening of disease that precludes surgery (as determined by the Investigator).
•If surgery is possible but not performed for ot her reasons (eg, participant refuses, worsening
of medical condition), then the particip ant may continue on study treatment and w ill be
considered to have an EFS event if and when there is defined progression or biopsy confirmed
local recurrence.
•If surgery is attempted but gross resection is abandoned, due to unresectable tumor or
worsening of disease, then that will be considered an EFS event.
•If surgery is completed with no or only microscopic residual disease (positive margins, notvisible on imaging), then the participant will continue on study and will be considered to have
an EFS event if and when radiographically visible recurrence occurs.
•If surgery is completed after the development of distant disease (visible on imaging) or
in-transit disease, it will be considered as an EFS event.
•Local recurrence
−Local relapse: Defined as the area bound by the midline of the sternum, extending
superiorly to the clavicle and inferiorly to the costal margin. Soft tissue recurrences in this
area extending into the bony chest wall or extending across the midline will be considered
as evidence of local recurrence. Provide hi stologic or cytological confirmation if clinically
feasible.
−Regional relapse: Defined as evidence of tumor in the axillary scar, ipsilateral nodal areas
(axillary, internal mammary, supraclavicular), extra- nodal soft tissue of the ipsilateral
axilla, as well as skin or soft tissues within the regional area. Provide histologic,cytological, or radiologic confirmation if clinically feasible.
−Contralateral BC: Defined as invasive tumor in the contralateral breast.

submitted to the central imaging vendor as soon as possible. X-rays that clearly demonstr ate 
interval progression of disease (eg, most commonly as unequivocal lesions that are unmistakably new) should be submitted to the central imaging vendor; otherwise, radiographs do not need to be 
submitted centrally. Any additional imaging that may demonstrate tumor response or disease 
recurrence or disease progression (including scans performed at unscheduled timepoints and/or at 
an outside institution) should be submitted to the central imaging vendor.
Every attempt should be made to image each participant using an ident ical acquisition protocol on 
the same scanner for all imaging timepoints. Tumor assessments fo r all participants s hould 
continue per protocol, even if dosing is delayed or discontinued. Tumor measurements should be 
made by the same Investigator or radiologist for each assessment, whenever possible. Change in 
tumor measurements and tumor response to guide ongoing study treatment decisions will be 
assessed by the Investigator using the modified RECIST v1.1 criteria (refer to Appendix 8).
9.1.5.1 Objective Response Rate
ORR will be assessed by imaging at the end of the neoadjuvant treatment prior to Surgery.
For the purposes of this study, tumor response assessments will be performed by bilateral 
ultrasound or mammogram of breast and axilla or breast MRI. Changes in tumor measurements and tumor responses will be assessed by the same Investigator or designee. The timepoint of tumor assessments will be reported on the eCRF based on the Investigator’s assessment.
Assessments of partial response and comp lete res ponse do not require confirmation. A best 
objective response of stable disease requires a minimum of 42 days on study from ra ndom ization 
to the date of the follow-up imaging assessment.9.1.6 Clinical Response by Physical Examination
Clinical response by physical examination (PE; palpation) will be assessed throughout study visits
as outlined in Section 2 (Schedule of Activities).
Target lesions should be followed clinically and their clinical size recorded at baseline. 
Measurements are required at the completion of the PTX neoadjuvant cycles and at the completion of the Neoadjuvant Phase prior to Surgery. In situ carcinoma does not represent a non-target lesion and should not be recorded or followed.
9.1.7 Breast-conserving Surgery Rate
BCS rate is defined as the number of participants who undergo BCS after completing the study 
treatments divided by the number of randomized participants for each treatment group.
For this study, planned surgery (mastectomy or BCS) at the time of diagnosis or baseline and the 
actual surgery the participants undergo after completion of the study treatment will be captured on

the eCRF, to assess BCS rate with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without nivolumab in 
participants with untreated high-risk ER+, HER2- primary BC.
9.1.8 Clinical Outcomes Assessments
The evaluation of COAs is an increasingly important aspect of clinical efficacy in oncology trials. 
Such data provide an understanding of the impact of treatment from the participant’s perspective 
and offer insights into patient experience that may not be capture d through physician reporting. 
Additionally, generic h ealth-related quality of lif e (HRQOL) measures provide d ata needed for 
calculating utility values to i nform health economic models.
Participants will be asked to comp lete the EORTC Qu ality of Life Questionnaire– Core 30 
(QLQ-C30), EORTC Quality of Life Questio nnaire-Breast Cancer-specific Module (QLQ- BR23), 
5-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaires a nd selected items Functi onal Assessmen t of Chronic
Illness Therapy General Physical Item 5 (FACIT GP5) as indicated in Section 2 (Schedule of
Activities). The questionnaires will be provided in the participant’s preferred language, if
available, and may be administered using electronic devices or a web-based platform. At sites,
where the electronic device is not available at study start or where the language is not yet available
in the device, paper administration of questionnaires will be permitted. When the electronic deviceand/or language becomes available at those sites, paper administration of the questionnaires willno longer be allowed. If exceptional circumstances preclude the continued administration of
measures using planned modalities, then alternative administration methods may be required after
consultation with Sponsor or the Sponsor’s representative.
The questionnaires should be administered during the Neoadjuvant (Pre-surgery) Phase, at the pre-
surgery visit, at the post-surgery visit, during th e Adjuvant (Post-surgery) Phase, and at the end of 
adjuvant therapy at the start of any visit before the participant sees the physician and before any study-related procedures are performed (with the exception of procedures completed 72 hours 
prior to a visit). Section 2 (Schedule of Activities) provides information regarding the timing of 
COAs.
9.1.8.1 EORTC QLQ-C30
The EORTC QLQ-C30 will be used to assess the effects of disease symptoms on functioning and 
well-being. The EORTC QLQ-C30
122is the most commonly used QOL instrument in oncology 
trials. The instrument’s 30 items are divided among 5 functional s cales (physical, role, cognitive, 
emotional, and social), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, dyspnea, insomnia, 
appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties), and a global health/QOL scale. 
With the exception of 2 items included in the global health/QOL scale, for which responses range from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent), item res ponses range from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). 
Raw scores for the EORTC QLQ-C30 are transformed to a 0-100 metric, such that higher values 
indicate better functioning or QOL or a higher level of symptoms. A score difference of 10 will be 
used as an estimate of a clinically meaningful difference for the subscales of the 
EORTC QLQ-C30.

9.1.8.2 EORTC QLQ-BR23
The EORTC QLQ-BR23124will be used to assess symptoms and QOL domains sp ecific to a BC
patient population. It is a valid and reliable measure of concerns and symptoms specific to BC and 
its treatment. The questi onnaire’s 23 items are divided among multi-item scales measuring 
systemic therapy side effects (7 items), bodily  image (4 items), breast symptoms (4 items), arm 
symptoms (3 items), and sexual functioning (2 items), as well as single-item measures of sexual 
enjoyment, future perspective, and bother due to hair loss. The questionnaire’s items use a 4-point response scale ra nging from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very muc h). Similar to the EORTC QLQ-C30, 
raw scores for the EORTC QLQ-BR23 are transformed to a 0-100 metric, such that higher values 
indicate better functioning or QOL or a higher level of symptoms. A score difference of 10 will be used as an estimate of a clinically meaningful difference f or the subscales of the 
EORTC QLQ-BR23.
9.1.8.3 FACIT GP5
A single item drawn from the FACIT measurement system, item GP5, will be administered to 
assess the overall extent of perceived bother due  to symptomatic AEs. Evidence exists for the 
validity of this item and its usefulness as  an overall summary measure of burden due to 
symptomatic treatment toxicities.
125
9.1.8.4 EQ-5D-5L
Participants’ reports of general health status w ill be assessed using the 5-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-
5L) questionnaire. The EQ-5D-5L has 2 component s: a descriptive system and a visual analogue 
scale (VAS). The instrument’s descri ptive system consists of 5 d imensions: mobility, self-care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension describes 5 levels of 
problems, including “ no,” “slight,” “moderate,” “severe, ” and “extreme” or “unable to.” A 
dimension for which there are no problems is said to be at level 1, while a dimension for which 
there are extreme problems is said to be at level 5. Thus, the numbers 11111 and 55555 represent 
the best health state and the worst health state, respectively, described by the EQ-5D-5L. 
Altogether, the instrument describes 55= 3,125 health states. Empirically derived weights can be 
applied to an individual’s responses to the EQ-5D-5L to generate a ut ility index measuring the 
value to society of his or her current health. In addition, the EQ-5D-5L a VAS allows respondents to rate their own curre nt health on a 101-point s cale ranging from 0 = ”w orst imaginable” to 
100 = “best imaginable.” In oncology applications, post-baseline score changes 7 for the VAS are considered to be clinically meaningful.
9.2 Adverse Events
The definitions of an AE  or SAE can be found in Appendix 3 .
AEs will be reported by the pa rticipant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legally au thorized repre sentative).
The Investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and re porting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that

are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study, or that caused the participant to 
discontinue before completing the study.
Contacts for SAE reporting specified in Appendix 3.
9.2.1 Immune-mediated Adverse Events
IMAEs are AEs consistent with an immune- mediated mechanism or immune-mediated component 
for which non-inflammatory etiologies (eg, i nfection, tum or progression) have been ruled out. 
IMAEs can include events with an alter nate etiology that were exacerbated by the i nduction of 
autoimmunity. Information supporting the assessment will be collected on the participant’s eCRF.
9.2.2 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
All non-serious AEs (not only those deemed to be treatment-related) s hould be collected 
continuously during the tr eatment period and for a minimum of 100 days fo llowing discontinuation 
of study treatment.
Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the IB represent the Reference Safety Information to determine 
expectedness of SAEs for expedited reporting.
All SAEs must be collected from the time of signing the consent, including those th ought to be 
associated with protocol-specif ied procedures and for a minimum of 100 days of discontinuation 
of dosing. For participants randomized/assigned to tr eatment and never tr eated with study drug, 
SAEs should be collected for 30 days from the date of random ization.
All AEs of special interest (SAE or nonserious AE) as described in Section 9.2.1
(Immune-mediated Adverse Events) must be collected throughout the Long-term Follow-up (until
the end of the study).
All AEs (SAE or non-serious AE) related to the prot ocol-specified definitive breast cancer surgery 
should be collected continuously during the treatment period and for a minimum of 100 days 
following discontinuation of study treatment.
The Investigator must report any SAE that occurs af ter these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure (eg, a follow-up skin biopsy).
•Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the CRF module.
•All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
in Appendix 3.
•The Investigator will submit any updated SAE d ata to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours
of the updated information being available.
All SAEs, and all AEs (SAEs and non-serious AEs) asso ciated with confirmed or suspected SARS-
CoV-2 infection must be collected from the date of the participant’s written consent until 100 days 
following discontinuation of dosing.
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. 
However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE,  including a death, at any time after a participant

BMS-936558 nivolumab
has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study 
treatment or study particip ation, the Investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.
The method of evaluating and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3.
9.2.3 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
AEs can be spontaneously reported or elicited duri ng open-ended questioning, examination, or 
evaluation of a participant. Care should be taken not to introduce bias when collecting AEs and/or 
SAEs. Inquiry about specific AEs should be guided by clinical judgement in the context of known AEs, when appropri ate for th e program or protocol.
Every AE must be assessed by the Investigator w ith regard to whether it is considered 
immune-mediated. For events that are potentially  immune-mediated, additional information will 
be collected on the participant’s eCRF.
9.2.4 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
•Nonserious AEs should be followed to resoluti on or stabilization, or re ported as SAEs if they
become serious (see Appendix 3).
•Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of
study treatment and for those present at the e nd of study tr eatment, as a ppropriate.
•All identified nonserious AEs must be recorde d and described on the nonserious AE page of
the case report form (CRF; paper or electronic). Completion of supplemental CRFs may berequested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that are re ported/identified during the course
of the study.
After the initial AE/SAE re port, the Investigator is re quired to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and nonser ious AEs of special interest (as defined in 
Section 9.2.1 [Immune-mediated Adverse Events])
and AEs (SAEs and non-serious AEs) associated 
with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection will be followed until resolution, the condition 
stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, the event is deemed irreversible, or the participant is 
lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 8.3 [Lost to Follow-up]) or for suspected cases, until SARS-
CoV-2 infection is ruled out.
Further information on follow-up procedures is given in Appendix 3.
9.2.5 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
•Prompt notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor of SAEs is essential so that legal
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a
product under clinical investigation are met.
•An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing SAEs or other specificsafety information (eg, su mmary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor w ill file it along with
the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.

BMS-936558 nivolumab
The Sponsor or designee will be reporting AEs to regulatory authorities and IECs, according to 
local applicable laws including European Di rective 2001/20/EC and FDA Code of Federal 
Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320. A suspected, unexpected serious adverse reaction
(SUSAR) is a subset of SAEs and will be reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities and 
Investigators, following local and global guidelines and requirements.
9.2.6 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the study treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a participant is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposure, including during at least 
5 half-lives after product administration, the Investigator must immediately notify the BMS Medical Monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form 
to the BMS designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE 
reporting procedures described in Appendix 3 .
If the Investigator d etermines a possible favorable benefit-risk ratio that warrants continuation of 
study treatment or re-init iation of study tr eatment, a discussion between the Investigator and the 
BMS Medical Monitor/designee must occur. If, for whatever reason, the pregnancy has ended, 
confirmed by negative serum pregnancy test, treatmen t may be resumed (at least 3 weeks and not 
greater than 6 weeks after the pregnancy has ended), following approvals of participant/Sponsor/IRB/IEC, as applicable.
Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be re ported to 
the Sponsor or designee. In or der for the Sponsor or designee to collect any pregnancy surveillance
information from the female part ner, the female partner must sign an ICF for disclosure of this 
information. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.
In cases where a study drug can be present in seminal fluid, at exposures sufficient to potentially 
cause fetal toxicity, and if any sexual activity (eg, vaginal, anal, oral) has occurred between a male 
participant and a pregnant WOCBP partner(s), the information should be reported to the Sponsor or designee, even if the male participant ha s undergone a successful vasectomy. In order for the 
Sponsor or designee to  collect any pregnancy surveillance information from the female pa rtner, 
the female partne r(s) must sign an ICF for disclosure of this information. Information on the 
pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form. For additional details on country specific requirements, refer to Appendix 9. 
9.2.7 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE eCRF 
page or SAE Report Form electronic, as appropriate. Paper forms are only intended as a back-up 
option when the electronic system is not functioning.
•Any laboratory test result that is clinically si gnificant or meets the definition of an SAE.

BMS-936558 nivolumab
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to have study tr eatment
discontinued or interrupted.
•Any laboratory test result  abnormality that required the participant to receive specific 
corrective therapy.
It is expected that wherever possible, the clini cal, rather than laboratory, term would be used by 
the reporting Investigator (eg, anemia vs low hemoglobin value).
9.2.8 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver-rel ated laboratory abnormalities s hould 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI (p -DILI) event. All occurrences of p-DILIs meeting 
the defined criteria must be reported as SAEs (see Section 9.2.5 and Appendix 3  for reporting 
details).
p-DILI is defined as:
1) Aminotransaminase (AT; ALT or AST) elevation > 3× ULN
AND2) Total bilirubin > 2 ×ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum ALP)
AND
3) No other immediately a pparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
9.2.9 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final PEs, ECG, X-ray filming, radiation, and 
any other potential safety assessment required or not required by protocol should also be recorded 
as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.
9.2.10 Management Algorithms for Nivolumab
IO agents are associated with IMAEs that can diffe r in severity and duration from AEs caused by 
other therapeutic classes. Nivolumab is considered an IO agent in this protocol. Early recognition 
and management of IMAEs associated with IO agen ts may mitigate severe toxicity. Management 
algorithms have been developed from extensive experience with nivolumab to assist Investigators 
in assessing and managing the following groups of IMAEs:
•GI
•Renal
•Pulmonary
•Hepatic
•Endocrinopathies
•Skin

9.3 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. Overdoses that meet the regulatory 
definition of an SAE will be reported as an SAE (refer to Appendix 3).
All instances of accidental overdose and/or dosing errors should be reported on the Record of 
Study Medication eCRF.
There is no available information concerning overdose with nivolumab. Depending on the 
symptoms and/or signs leading to the suspicio n of overdose, supportive medical management 
should be provided. There is no specific antidote.

Any incidental findings of potent ial clinical relevance that are not directly associated with the 
objectives of the protocol should be evaluated and handled by the Investigator per standard 
medical/clinical judgment.
9.5 Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity
Samples for PK and immunogenicity assessments will be co llected for study participants in both 
the Neoadjuvant (Pre-surgery) Phase and the Adjuvant (Post-surgery) Phase at prespecified 
timepoints, as described in Table 9.5-1 . All timepoints are relative to the start of nivolumab or 
nivolumab placebo administration. All timepoints during the Treatment Period are intended to

align with days on which nivolumab or nivolumab placebo is administered. If it is known that a 
nivolumab dose is going to be delayed/omi tted, then the predose sample should be collected just 
prior to the next scheduled dose. However, if a predose sample is collected but the dose is 
subsequently delayed/omi tted, an additional predose sample s hould not be collected. During the 
Adjuvant phase, when the treatment assignment is unblinded, PK and immunogenicity samples 
should no longer be collected in the placebo cohort for participants randomized to Arm B. Further 
details of sample co llection, processing, and shipment will be provided in the Laboratory 
Procedures Manual. In addition, bioanalytics staff will be unblinded to the randomized treatment assignment in order to permit PK/IMG assays on samples from investigational arm only.
Serum PK samples will be analyzed for nivolumab concentrations by a validated ligand binding 
immunoassay method, and immunogenicity serum samples will be analyzed for anti-nivolumab 
antibodies by a validated immunoassay method. Immunogenicity serum samples may also be 
analyzed for nivolumab-neutra lizing antibodies by a validated cell-based method. In additi on, 
selected serum samples may be analyzed by an exploratory method that measures nivolumab, or detects anti-nivolumab antibodies for technology exploration purposes; exploratory results w ill 
not be reported. The corresponding serum samp les designated for either PK, immunogenicity, or 
biomarker assessments may also be used for any of those analyses, if required (eg, insufficient sample volume to complete testing or to follow up on a suspected immunogenicity-related AE).

bSince the EOI-PK sample is drawn with the intent of  accurately estimating the maximum  concentration of the drug,
draw the EOI-PK when all the study drug has been infused. If the site infuses drug without a flush, then collect the 
EOI-PK sample within approximately 5 minutes after the EOI. If a flush is administered to clear the IV lines of the drug and to ensure the delivery of the entire drug dose , then draw the EOI-PK sample within approximately 5 
minutes after end of the flush. Do not draw EOI samples from the same IV access that the drug was administered.
cWhen the treatment assign ment is unblinded, and the participant is assigned to Arm B, PK and IMG samples should
no longer be collected.

9.8.2 Tumor-based Biomarkers
9.8.2.1 PD-L1 ExpressionThe PD-L1 status in the study is primarily deter mined by an analytically  validated qualitative IHC 
assay, PD-L1 SP142, using rabbit monoclonal anti-PD-L1 clone SP142 on the proportion of tumor 
area occupied by PD-L1-expressing tumor-infiltr ating immune cells (% IC) of any intensity. The 
PD-L1 status must be confirmed from a designated central laboratory prior to randomization. 
Participants with PD-L1 expression (% IC) higher than the defined cutoff (eg, 1%) w ill be 
considered as the PD-L1+ population. Several s econdary and exploratory endpoints of the study 
will be c onducted in the PD-L1+ population. Par ticipants with a PD-L1 status of unknown/not 
evaluable are not eligible.
In addition, PD-L1 e xpression determined by another quanti tative IHC assay, PD-L1 28-8, using 
Combined Positive Score (CPS) will also be explored, in which the PD-L1 s tatus in all PD -L1 
staining cells including tumor cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages would be reported.

9.8.4 Additional Research Collection
This protocol will include residual samp le storage for additional research (AR). 1TAny remaining 
tissue collected for this study will be used for AR. Residual blood (or blood derivatives, such as 
serum, plasma, plasma ctDNA, PBMCs, and extracted RNA/DNA), tumor tissue (archival or fresh 
biopsy and extr acted R NA/DNA) from tumor biopsy, and stool collections ( Table 9.8.4-1 ) will 
also be retained for AR purposes.
For All US sites:
AR is required for all study participants, except where prohibited by IRBs/IECs , or 
academic/institutional requirements. Where 1 or more of these exceptions occurs, participation in 
the AR should be enc ouraged but will not be a condition of overall study participation.
•If the IRB/IEC and site agree to the mandatory  AR retention and/or collection, then the study 
participant must agree to the mandatory AR as a requirement for inclusion in the study.

•If optional participation is permitted and approved, then the study participants may opt out of
the additional AR and/or collection.
For non-US Sites
AR is optional for all study participants, excep t where retention and/or collection is prohibited by 
local laws or regulations, IECs, or institutional requirements.
This collection for AR is intended to expand the translational R&D capability at BMS, and will 
support as-yet-undefined research aims that will advance our understanding of disease and options 
for treatment. It may also be used to support h ealth aut hority requests for analysis, and 
advancement of pharmacodiagnostic development to better target drugs to the right patients. This may also include genetic/genomic expl oration aimed at exploring disease pathways, 
progression, response to treatment, etc.
Sample Collection and Storage
All requests for access to samples or data for AR will be vetted through a diverse committee of the 
study Sponsor’s senior leaders in R&D (or design ee) to ensure that the research supports 
appropriate and well-defined scientific research activities.
Samples kept for future research will be stored at the BMS Biorepository  or 
an independent, BMS-approved storage vendor.The manager of these samples will ensure that they are properly used throughout their usable life 
and will destroy the samples at the end of the scheduled storage period, no longer than fifteen (15) 
years after the end of the study or the maximum allowed by applicable law.
Transfers of samples by the research Sponsor to third parties will be s ubject to the recipient’s 
agreement to establish similar storage procedures.
Samples will be stored in a coded fashion, and no researcher will have access to the key. The key 
is securely held by the Investigator at the clinical site,  so there is no direct ability for a researcher 
to connect a sample to a specific individual.
Further details of sample collection and processing w ill be provided to the site in the procedure 
manual .

9.9 Health Economics OR Medical Resource Utilization and Health 
Economics
Healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) d ata w ill be collected for all randomized participants using 
an internal measure developed for use in previ ous trials. The questionnaire records information 
about medical care encounters, including hospital admissions and their duration, outpatient visits, 
diagnostic tests and procedures, concomitant medications, and reasons for encounters.
HCRU data associated with medical encounters will be collected on the eCRF by the Investigator
and study-site personnel for all participants throughout the study. Protocol-mandated procedures, 
tests, and encounters are excluded.
The data collected may be used to conduct exploratory economic analyses and will include:
•Number and duration of medical care encoun ters, including surgeries, and other selected 
procedures (inpatient and outpatient).
•Duration of hospitalization (total days length of stay, including duration by wards [eg, intensive 
care unit]).
•Number and character of diagnostic and therapeutic tests and procedures.
•Outpatient medical encounters and treatments (including physician or emergency room visits, 
tests and procedures, and medications).
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Sample Size Determination 
The primary objective of this study is to comp are the pCR rates betw een treatment groups in all 
randomized participants. The pCR rates w ill be compared at the 0.05 alpha level. 
As of 16-May-2022, a total of 521 participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Arm A and Arm 
B. See Table 10.1-1 for a summary of the power assumptions.
Given a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, 521 participants will provide approximately 87% power to detect a 10% pCR difference between Arm A and Arm B, assuming a pCR of 22% and 12% for all 
randomized participants in Arm A and Arm B, respectively.

10.3.5 Interim Analyses
The SAP will further describe the planned interim analysis.
10.3.5.1 Futility Analysis Based on pCR
An interim futility analysis of pCR w ill be conducted when approximately 260 ITT participants 
are randomized and have the opportunity to be evaluated for pCR (approximately 29 months from 
the first participant randomization date). At the time of the analysis, IDMC will evaluate whetherthe following futility st opping criterion is met and notify the Sponsor. The fut ility analysis is 
non-binding and the decision of whether to continue the trial will be made by the study team based on the analysis results. The study will remain blinded at the fut ility analysis.
Consider stopping the trial when both Δ pCR in PD-L1+ participants ≤ 4% and Δ pCR in ITT 
participants ≤ 2%, where ΔpCR = estimated pCR in Arm A - estimated pCR in Arm B.

APPENDIX 2 STUDY GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONS
The terms “participant” and “subject” refer to a person who has consented to participate in the 
clinical research study. Ty pically, the term “participant” is used in the protocol and the term 
“subject” is used in the Case Report Form (CRF).
REGULATORY AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE
This study will be conducted in accordance with:
•Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines, including the Declaration
of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS)
International Ethical Guidelines
•Applicable International Council for Har monisation (ICH) Good Clin ical Pract ice (GCP)
Guidelines
•Applicable laws, regulations, and requirements
The study will be c onducted in compliance with the protocol. The protocol, any 
revisions/amendments, and the participant informed consent form (ICF) will r eceive 
approval/favorable opinion by Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC), and regulatory authoritie s according to applicable regulations prior to 
initiation of the study.
All potential serious breaches must be re ported to the Sponsor or designee immediately. A 
potential serious breach is defined as a Quality Issue (eg, protocol deviation) that is likely to affect, 
to a significant degree, one or more of the fo llowing: (1) the rights, physical safety or mental 
integrity of one or more participants; (2) the scientific value of the clinical trial (eg, reliability and 
robustness of generated data). Items (1) or (2) can be  associated with either GCP regulation(s) or 
trial protocol(s).
Personnel involved in conducting this st udy will be qu alified by education, traini ng, and 
experience to perform their respective tasks.
This study will not use the services of study pe rsonnel where sanctions have been invoked or where 
there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (eg, loss of medical licensure, debarment). 
INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD/INDEPENDENT ETHICS COMMITTEE
Before study initiation, the investigator must ha ve written and dated approval/favorable opinion 
from the IRB/IEC for the protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, product labeling information, ICF, 
participant recruitment materials (eg, a dvertisements), and any other written i nformation to be 
provided to  participants.

INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS
Investigators must ensure that participants ar e clearly and fu lly informed about the purpose, 
potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they volunteer to 
participate. 
The Sponsor or designee will provide the investigat or with an appropriate sample ICF, which will 
include all elements required by the ICH  GCP, and applicable regulatory requir ements. The sample 
ICF will adhere to the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.The investigator or his/her representative must:
•Obtain IRB/IEC written approval/favorable opinion of the written ICF and any other 
information to be provided to the participant prior to the beginning of the study and after any revisions are completed for new information.
•Provide a copy of the ICF and written i nformation a bout the study in the language in which 
the participant is proficient pr ior to clinical study participation. The language must be 
nontechnical and easily understood. 
•Explain the nature of the study to the pa rticipant or his/her legally  acceptable representative
and answer all questions regarding the study.
•Inform participant that his/her p articipation is voluntary. Participant or his/her legally 
acceptable representative w ill be required to si gn a statement of informed  consent that meets 
the requirements of 21 CFR 50, local regulations, ICH guidelines, Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements, where applicable, a nd the IRB/IEC or study 
center.
•Allow time necessary for participant or his/he r legally acceptable representative to inquire 
about the details of the study.
•Obtain an ICF signed and personally date d by participant or his/ her legally acceptable 
representative and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion. 
•Include a statement in participan t’s medical rec ord that written informed consent was obtained 
before participant was enrolled in the study and the date the written consent was obtained. The 
authorized person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the ICF.
•Re-consent participant to the most current version of the ICF(s) during his/her participation in 
the study, as applicable.
Revise the ICF whenever important new information becomes available that is relevant to the 
participant’s consent. The investigator, or a person designated by the inve stigator, should fully 
inform the participant or his/he r legally acceptable representative of all pertinent aspects of the 
study and of any new information relevant to the participant’s willingness to continue participation 
in the study. This communication should be documented.
The confidentiality of records that could identify participants must be protected, respecting the 
privacy and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements, the participant’s signed 
ICF, and, in the US, the participant’s signed HIPAA Authorization.

4.0 Approved 930139564 4.0v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA2097FL
BMS-936558 nivolumab
The ICF must also include a statement that BMS and local and foreign regulatory authorities have 
direct access to participant records.
In situations where consent cannot be given by participants, their legally acceptable represen tatives 
(as per country regulation) are clearly and fully informed a bout the purpose, po tential risks, and 
other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the participant volunteers to participate. 
If informed consent is initially given by a par ticipant’s legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardian and the participant subsequently becomes capable of making and communicating his or 
her informed consent during the study, consent must additionally be obtained from the participant.
The rights, safety, and well-being of the study pa rticipants are the most important considerations 
and should prevail over interests of science and society.SOURCE DOCUMENTS
Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate the 
integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator’s site.
Data reported on the CRF or entered in the elect ronic CRF (eCRF) that are transcribed from source 
documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. 
•The investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending 
on the study. Also, current medical records must be available.
•Definitions of what constitutes source data can be found in the Source document location map (or equivalent) and Site Process Source Document.
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the source data are accurate, legible, 
contemporaneous, original, and attributable, whether the data are handwritten on paper or entered 
electronically. If source data  are created (first entered), modified, maintained, archived, retrieved, 
or transmitted electronically via computer ized systems (and/or any other kind of electronic 
devices) as part of regulated clinical trial activities, such systems must be compliant with all 
applicable laws and regulations governing use of electronic records and/ or electronic signatures. 
Such systems may include, but are not limited to, electronic med ical rec ords/electronic h ealth 
records, adverse event (AE) tracking/reporting, protocol-required assessments, and/or drug accountability records.
When paper records from such systems are used in p lace of an electronic format to perform 
regulated activities, such paper records s hould be certified copies. A certified copy consists of a 
copy of original information that has been verified, as indicated by a d ated signature, as an exact 
copy having all of the same attributes and information as the original. STUDY TREATMENT RECORDS
Records for study intervention (whether supplied by BMS, its vendors, or the site) must 
substantiate study intervention integrity and traceability from receipt, preparation, administration, 
and through destruction or return. Records must be  made available for review at the request of 
BMS/designee or a Health Authority.

under law and the standard operating procedures/standards of the sourcing pharmacy
BMS or its designee will provide forms to fac ilitate invent ory control if the investigational site 
does not have an established system that meets these requirements.
CASE REPORT FORMS
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed 
to record all observations and other d ata pertinent to the investig ation on each i ndividual treated 
or entered as a control in the investigation. Data that are derived from source documents and reported on the CRF must be consistent with  the source documents, or the discrepan cies must be 
explained. Additional clinical information may be coll ected and analyzed in an effort to enhance 
understanding of product safety. CRFs may be reque sted for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities 
that are reported or identified during the course of the study.
For sites using the Sponsor or de signee electronic data capture (EDC) tool, eCRFs will be prepared 
for all data collection fields except for fields sp ecific to SAEs and pregnancy, which will be

reported on the electronic SAE form and Pregnancy Surveillance Form, respectively. If the 
electronic SAE form is not av ailable, a paper SAE form can be used. Spaces may be left blank 
only in those circumstances permitted by study -specific CRF completion  guidelines  provided by
the Sponsor or designee.
The confidentiality of records that could identify participants must be protected, respecting the 
privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s).
The investigator will maintain a signature sheet to  document signatures and initials of all persons 
authorized to make entries and/or corrections on CRFs. The completed CRF and SAE/pregnancy CRFs must  be promptly reviewed, signed, and dated by 
the investigator or qualified physician who is a sub-investigator and who is delegated this task on 
the Delegation of Authority Form. Sub-investigators in Japan may not be delegated the CRF 
approval task. For eCRFs, review and approval/signature is completed electronically through the 
BMS EDC tool. The investigator must retain a copy of the CRFs, including records of the changes 
and corrections.
Each individual electronically signing eCRFs must meet Sponsor or designee training 
requirements and must only access the BMS EDC t ool using the unique user account provided by 
the Sponsor or designee. User accounts are not to be shared or reassigned to other individuals.MONITORING
Sponsor or designee representatives will review data centrally to identify potential issues to 
determine a schedule of on-site visits fo r targeted review of study records.
Representatives of BMS must be allowed to visit all study site locations periodically to assess the 
data quality and study integrity. On site, they will review study records and directly compare them 
with source documents, discuss the conduct of the study with the investigator, and verify that the 
facilities r emain acceptable.
Certain CRF pages and/or electronic files may serve as the source documents.
In addition, the study may be evaluated by the Sponsor or designee internal auditors and 
government inspectors who must be allowed access to CRFs, source documents, other study files, 
and study facilities. BMS audit reports will be kept confidential.
The investigator must notify BMS promptly of any inspections scheduled by regu latory authorities 
and promptly forward copies of inspection reports to the Sponsor or designee.
RECORDS RETENTION
The investigator (or head of the study site in Japan) must retain all study records and source 
documents for the maximum period required by applicable regulations and guidelines, or 
institution procedures, or for the period specified  by BMS or its designee, whichever is longer. 
The investigator (or head of the study site in  Japan) must contact BMS prior to destroying any 
records associated with the study.

BMS or its designee will notify the investigator (or head of the study site in Japan) when the study 
records are no longer needed.
If the investigator withdraws from the study (eg, relocation, retirement), the records sh all be 
transferred to a mutually agreed-upon designee (e g, another investigator, study site, IRB). Notice 
of such transfer will be given in writing to BMS or its designee. RETURN OF STUDY TREATMENT
For this study, study treatments (t hose supplied by BMS or a vendor or s ourced by the 
investigator), such as partially used study treatment containers, vials, and syringes, may be 
destroyed on site. 
If Then
Study treatments supplied by BMS (including its vendors)Any unused study interventions supplied by BMS can only be destroyed after being inspected and reconciled by the responsible 
Study Monitor, unless study treatments 
containers must be immediately destroyed as required for safety, or to meet local regulations (eg, cytotoxics or biologics).
Partially used study interventions and/or 
empty containers may be destroyed after proper reconciliation a nd documentation. But 
unused IMP must be reconciled by site 
monitor/Clinical Research Associate prior to 
destruction.
If study treatments will be returned, the return 
will be arranged by the res ponsible Study 
Monitor.

•Records are maintained th at allow for traceability of each container, including the d ate 
disposed of, quantity disposed, and identification of the person disposing the containers. The 
method of disposal (eg, incinerator, licensed sanitary landfill, or licensed waste-disposal vendor) must be documented.
•Accountability and disposal records are complete, up-to-date, and available for the Study Monitor to review throughout the clinical trial period.
It is the investigator’s or designee’s responsibility to arrange for disposal of all empty containers.
If conditions for destruction cannot be met, the re sponsible Study Monitor will make a rrangements 
for return of study tr eatments provided by BMS (or its vendors). Destruction of non-st udy 
treatments s ourced by the site, not supplied by BMS, is solely the responsibility of the investigator 
or designee.
STUDY AND SITE START AND CLOSURE
The Sponsor/designee reserves  the right to close the study site or to terminate the st udy at any time 
for any reason at the sole discretion of th e Sponsor. Study sites w ill be clos ed upon study 
completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have 
been collected and a study-site closure visit has been performed.
The investigator may initiate study-site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and 
sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the Sponsor or investigator may include, but are 
not limited to:
•Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC or 
local Health Authorities, the Sponsor’s procedures, or GCP guidelines
•Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator
•Discontinuation of further study intervention development
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Sponsor sh all promptly inform the 
investigators, the IECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any contract research organization(s) 
used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as sp ecified by the applicable 
regulatory requirements. The investigator shall prompt ly inform the participant and should assure 
appropriate participant therapy and/or follow-up.
DISSEMINATION OF CLINICAL STUDY DATA

APPENDIX 3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS: 
DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW UP AND REPORTING
ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse Event Definition:
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurre nce or worsening of a 
pre-existing medical c ondition in a clin ical investigation participant administered study 
treatment that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or 
not considered related to the study treatment.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
•Any abnormal laboratory test results (hemato logy, clinical ch emistry, or uri nalysis) or
results from other safety assessments (eg, electrocardiograms, radiological scans, vital signs
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant
in the medical and scientific judgmen t of the investigator. Note that a bnormal lab tests or
other safety assessments should only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is notavailable. Once the final diagnosis is known, the reported term should be updated to be the
diagnosis.
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition, including either an increase
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
•New conditions d etected or diagnosed after study inte rvention administration, even though
it may have been present before the start of the study.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention
or a concomitant medication. Overdose, as a verbatim term (as reported by the investigator),
should not be reported as an AE/serious adverse event (SAE) unless it is an intentional
overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be
reported regardless of sequelae and should sp ecify “intentional overdose” as the verbatim
term.
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
•Medical or surgical procedure  (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads to
the procedure is the AE.
•Situations in which an untoward medical occ urrence did not occur (so cial and/or
convenience admission to a hospital).

BMS-936558 nivolumab
DEFINITION OF SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE, even if serious conditions 
are met.
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:
Results in death.
Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which  the participant was at risk of death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe).
Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization (see NOTE 
below).
NOTE: The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) clinical 
studies: 
•A visit to the emergency room or other hosp ital department < 24 hours that does not result
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event).
•Elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent.
•Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure.
•Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health
status (eg, routine colonoscopy).
•Medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases.
•Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status
and requires no medical/surgical inte rvention (eg, lack of housi ng, economic inadequacy,
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason).
•Admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other
SAEs (applies to oncology protocols).
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.

4.0 Approved 930139564 4.0v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA2097FL
BMS-936558 nivolumab
Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event[s] that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention [eg, medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outco mes listed in the definition above). Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive tr eatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm and blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization. Potential drug-i nduced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 9.2.7 for the definition of potential DILI.) 
Pregnancy and DILI must follow the same transmission timing and processes to BMS as used for SAEs. (See Section 9.2.5 for reporting pregnancies.)
Any component of a study endpoint that is consider ed related to study therapy should be reported 
as an SAE (eg, death is an endpoint; if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be 
reported).
EVALUATING AES AND SAES
Assessment of Causality
•The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.
•A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rath er than a relationship cannot be ruled out.
•The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
•Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of  the event to study intervention administration, 
will be considered and investigated.
•The investigator will also consult the Invest igator’s Brochure and/or product information for 
marketed products in his/her assessment.
•For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
•There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is very important that 
the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor.
•The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information 
and send an SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.
•The causality assessment is one of the criter ia used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.

4.0 Approved 930139564 4.0v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA2097FL
BMS-936558 nivolumab
•Assessment of Intensity
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study and assign it to 1 of the following categories: 
•Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by th e participant, causing minimal discomfort and
not interfering with everyday activities.
•Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday
activities.
•Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe
should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity ofan event, and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described 
in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.
Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
If only limited information is initially available, follow-up re ports are required. (Note: Follow-
up SAE reports must include the same i nvestigator term(s) initially reported.)
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study tr eatment or if new 
information becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours 
to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.

REPORTING OF SAES TO SPONSOR OR DESIGNEE
•SAEs, whether related or not related to study  treatment, and pregnancies must be reported
to BMS (or designee) immediately within 24 hours of awareness of the event.
•SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form.
−The required method for SAE data reporting is through the electronic case report
form (eCRF).
−The paper SAE Report Form is intended only as a back-up option when the electronic
data capture system is unavailable/not functioning for transmission of the eCRF to BMS
(or designee).
♦In this case, the paper form is transmitted via email or confirmed facs imile
transmission.
♦When paper forms are used, the original paper forms are to remain on site.
•Pregnancies must be recorded on paper Pregnancy Surveillance Forms and transmitted via
email or confirmed facsimile transmission.

APPENDIX 4 WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL DEFINITIONS AND 
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
Appendix 4 provides general information and definitions related to Woman of Childbearing 
Potential and methods of contraception that can be applied to most clinical trials. For information specific to this study regarding acceptable contraception requirements for female and male 
participants, refer to Section 6.1  of the protocol. Only the contraception methods as described in 
Section 6.1 are acceptable for this study.
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following mena rche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:•Premenarchal
•Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
−Documented hysterectomy
−Documented bilateral salpingectomy
−Documented bilateral oophorectomy
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
•Postmenopausal female
−A postmenopausal state is defined as 12 months of ame norrhea in a woman over age
45 years in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, females
under the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level
> 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Note: Females treated with hormone replacement ther apy (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may re quire a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the ty pe of HRT used. S uggested 
guidelines for the duration of the washout periods for HRT types are presented below. Investigators 
should use their judgement in checking serum FSH levels. 
•1-week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
•4-week minimum for transdermal products
•8-week minimum for oral products

4.0 Approved 930139564 4.0v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA2097FL
BMS-936558 nivolumab
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 months. If the serum FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/mL at any time during the washout period, the woman can be considered 
postmenopausal.
End of Relevant Systemic Exposure
End of relevant systemic exposure is the timep oint where the Investigational Medicinal Product 
(IMP) or any active major metabolites have decreased to a concentration that is no longer 
considered to be relevant for human teratogenicity or fetotoxicity. This should be evaluated in 
context of safety margins from the no-observed- adverse-effect level or the time required for 5 half-
lives of the IMP to pass.
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR FEMALE PARTICIPANTS OF CHILD BEARING 
POTENTIAL
One of the highly effective methods of contracep tion listed below is required during study duration 
and until the end of relevant systemic exposure, defined as 12 months after the end of study 
treatment, for participants who receive cyclophosphamide, or for 6 months for participants who 
do not receive cycl ophosphamide, after the last dose of study treatment with nivolumab or 
nivolumab placebo, whichever is longer.
Local laws and regulations may require use of alte rnative and/or additional contraception methods.
In the CA209-7FL study, use of hormonal methods of contraception is prohibited in 
WOCBP.
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent 
Failure rate of < 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.a
•Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containi ng) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation and/or implantation (The se methods of contraception cannot be used 
by WOCBP participants in studies where hormonal contraception is prohibited)b
−oral (birth control pills)
−intravaginal (vaginal birth control  suppositories, rings, creams, gels)
−transdermal
•Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (These 
methods of contraception cannot be used by WO CBP participants in studies where hormonal 
contraception is prohibited)b
−oral
−injectable
Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent
•Implantable progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation and/or imp lantation (This method of contraception cannot be used by WOCBP

•Intrauterine device (IUD)c
•Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS) (This method of contraception cannot be used
by WOCBP participants in studies where hormonal contraception is prohibited)b,c
•Bilateral tubal occlusion
•Vasectomized partner
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner
is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed.
If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.
•Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment.The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the
study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
•It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is
elected.
•WOCBP participants who choose complete abstin ence must continue to have pregnancy
tests, as specified in Section 2 .
•Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abstinence.
NOTES:
aTypical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical studies.
bHormonal contraception may be suscep tible to interaction w ith the study tre atment, which may reduce the
efficacy of the contraceptive method. Hormonal contracepti on is permissible only when there is sufficient 
evidence that the IMP and ot her study medications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception 
would be ineffective or result in increased exposures that could be potentially hazardous. In this case, alternative 
methods of contraception should be utilized.
cIntrauterine devices and intrauterine hormone releasing systems are acceptable methods of contraception in the
absence of definitive drug interaction studies when ho rmone exposures from intrauterine devices do not alter 
contraception effectiveness.
Less Than Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent 
Failure rate of >1% per year when used consistently and correctly.
•Male or female condom with or wit hout spermicide. Male a nd female condoms cannot be
used simultaneously
•Diaphragm with spermicide
•Cervical cap with spermicide
•Vaginal Sponge with spermicide
•Progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the
primary mechanism of action (This method of  contraception cannot be used by WOCBP
participants in studies where hormonal contraception is prohibited)

agree to the following during the treatment and until the end of relevant systemic exposure.
Inform any and all partner(s) of their participation in a clinical drug study and the need to comply 
with contraception instructions as directed by the investigator.
•Male who are sexually active with WOCBP must  agree to follow instructions for method(s) of
contraception and fetal pro tection for the duration of neoadjuvant (pre-surgery) treatment
phase, and 12 months after the last dose of cyclophosphamide OR 6 months after last dose of
paclitaxel, whichever is the last dose.

APPENDIX 6 MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS
These general guidelines constitute guidance to the Investigator and may be supplemented by 
discussions with the Medical Monitor represe nting the Sponsor. The guidance applies to all 
immuno-oncology agents and regimens.
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be diligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice. No n-inflammatory etiologies s hould be consider ed and appropriately 
treated.
Corticosteroids are a primary th erapy for immuno-oncology drug-related adverse events. The oral 
equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered for ambulatory patients with low 
grade toxicity. The lower bioavailability of oral corticosteroids should be taken into account when 
switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.
Consultation with a medical or surgical specialist, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
procedure, is recommended.The frequency and severity of the related adverse events covered by these algorithms will depend 
on the immuno-oncology agent or regimen being used.

APPENDIX 8 RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID TUMORS 
GUIDELINES (VERSION 1.1) WITH BMS MODIFICATIONS FOR 
NEOADJUVANT BREAST CANCER
HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY OF THE MODIFICATIONS
•Up to two lesions in the breast may be identified as target lesions.
•Lymph nodes are not to be designated as target or non-target lesions.
•Target and Non-Target lesions can be selected from mammography, ultrasound, or MRI.
•Removal of fluid  (ascites, pleural and pericardial effusions) from response  assessment as non-
target or new lesion due to potential unconfirmed etiology and volume changes resulting from
interventional procedures unrelated to treatment response (thoracentesis).
•Best Overall Response of CR or PR does not require confirmation. SD must meet minimumtime on study requirement as defined in protocol.
1 EVALUATION OF LESIONS
Solid tumors will be evalu ated using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 
(RECIST v1.1) guideline1with BMS modifications for neoadjuvant breast cancer.
At baseline, breast tumor lesions will be cate gorized as measurable or non-measurable as follows:
1.1 Measurable
Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (l ongest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded).
•Measurable lesions may be meas ured by mammography, ultrasound, or MRI.
1.2 Non-measurable
All other breast lesions are considered non-measurable, including small lesions.
1.3 Baseline Documentation Of ‘Target’ And ‘Non-target’ Lesions
Up to two lesions in the breast may be identified as target lesions. Per this protocol, first target 
lesion must be at least 20 mm and, if selected, second target lesion must be at least 10 mm. 
Lymph nodes are not to be designated as target or non-target lesions at baseline.
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of thei r size (lesions with the longest diameter) but 
in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. A sum of 
the longest diameters for all target lesions w ill be calcu lated and reported as the baseline sum 
diameters. The baseline sum diameters w ill be used as reference to further characterize any 
objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.
All other breast lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at 
baseline. Measurements are not required and thes e lesions should be fo llowed as ‘present’, 
‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progre ssion’ (more details to follow). In additi on, it is

possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case 
record form.
2 RESPONSE CRITERIA
2.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions
•Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.
•Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
•Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference th e smallest sum on study (t his includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative in crease of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression.
•Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
•Not Evaluable (NE): If one or more target lesions cannot be measured or adequately assessed 
as either fully resolved or too small to m easure (due to missing or poor quality i mages), and 
the sum of diameters of the remaining measured target lesions (if any) has not increased sufficiently to meet Progressive Disease as defined above. 
2.1.1 Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions
2.1.1.1 Target Lesions That Become ‘ Too Small to M easure’
While on study, all lesions recorded at baseline s hould have their actual measurements recorded 
at each subsequent evaluation, even when ve ry small (eg, 2 mm). However, sometimes lesions or 
lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so f aint on imaging that the 
radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may re port them as being 
‘too small to measure’. When this occurs it is important that a value be recorded on the case report 
form. If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be rec orded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small 
to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned as the reference diameter. The 
measurement of these lesions is potentially non-reproducible, therefore providing this default 
value will prevent false responses or progressions  based upon measurement error. To reiterate, 
however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
2.1.1.2 Lesions That Split or Coalesce on Treatment
When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented  portions should be 
added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between 
them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the 
vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the 
‘coalesced lesion’.

2.2 Evaluation of Non-target Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for the 
group of non-target lesions. While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need 
not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in 
the protocol.
•Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions.
•Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s).
•Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.
2.2.1 Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-target Disease
The concept of progression of non-target disease re quires additional explanation as follows:
2.2.1.1 When the Patient also has Measurable Disease
In this setti ng, to achieve ‘unequivo cal progression’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there 
must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. Pleural effusions, pericardial 
effusions and ascites will not be followed as targe t or non-target lesions and will not contribute to 
response or progression. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.
2.2.1.2 When the Patient has Only Non-measurable Disease
This circumstance arises in some trials when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable 
disease. The same general concepts apply here as noted above, however, in this instance there is 
no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non-measurable 
disease burden. Because worsening in non-ta rget disease cannot be easily quantified (by definition: 
if all lesions are truly non-measur able) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for 
unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the change 
in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to 
declare PD for measurable disease: ie, an increase in tumor burden representing an additional 73% 
increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to  a 20% increase di ameter in a meas urable lesion). 
Examples include, an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’. If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the 
patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that point. While it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non-measurable diseas e, the very nature of that disease makes it 
impossible to do so; therefore the increase must be substantial.
2.2.2 New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some comments 
on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not

4.0 Approved 930139564 4.0v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA2097FL
BMS-936558 nivolumab
attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging mod ality or findings t hought 
to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply 
healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline 
lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not.
NOTE: Fluid collections (pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, and ascites) will not be 
considered new lesions and will not contribute to response or progression. In the event a new fluid 
collection is seen on a post-baseline imaging exam , a comment may be made, but the appearance 
of a new fluid collection alone should not result in an assessment of Progressive Disease (PD). A 
lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is the patient 
who has visceral disease at baseline a nd while on st udy has a CT or MRI brain ordered which 
reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if 
he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. A lesion identified on Chest X-Ray that was not 
present in prior CT can be considered a new lesion and will result in Progressive Disease (PD).
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued follow-up evaluation 
will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is definitely a new 
lesion, then progression shoul d be declared using the date of the init ial scan. While FDG-PET 
response assessments need additional study , it is sometimes reasonable to inc orporate the use of 
FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in  assessment of progression (particularly 
possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according 
to the following algorithm:
1) Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based
on a new lesion.
2) No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: If the positive FDG-PET at
follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD. If the positive
FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up
CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the
date of PD will be the d ate of the init ial abnormal FDG-PET sca n). If the positive FDG-PET
at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site  of disease on CT that is not progressing on the
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
2.3 Response Assessment
2.3.1 Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment in the 
Neoadjuvant (Pre-surgery) Phase.
The patient’s best overall response assignment will depend on the findings of both target and non-
target disease and will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions. Assessments of partial response and complete response do not require confirmation.

2.3.2 Time Point Response
At each protocol specified time poi nt, a response assessment occurs. Table 2.3.2-1 provides a 
summary of the overall response status calculation at each time point for patients who have 
measurable disease at baseline. When patients have non-measurable (therefore non-target) disease 
only, Table 2.3.2-2 is to be used.

aNon-CR/non-PD is preferred over SD for non-target disease since SD is increasingly used as en dpoint for
assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised.
2.3.3 Best Overall Response
Best response determination of complete or part ial response does not require confirmation. When 
SD is believed to be best response, it must meet the protocol specified minimum time from the 
date of first treatment or randomization date.

For example, if the first scheduled follow-up imaging visit is Week 6 ( ±7 days) for a particular 
protocol, a Best Response of SD can only be made after the subject is on-study for a minimum of 
6 weeks (42 days) minus 7 days, for an absolute minimum time on-study of 35 days from the 
reference start date (reference date is considered Day 1 on study). If the subject is not on-study for at least this amount of time, any tumor assessment indicating stable disease before this time period will have a Best Response of NE unless PD is identified.
2.3.4 Confirmation Scans
Verification of Progression : Progressi on of disease should be verified in cases where progression 
is equivocal. If repeat scans confirm PD, then progression should be declared using the date of the 
initial scan. If repeat scans do not confirm PD, th en the subject is considered to not have 
progressive disease.

APPENDIX 10 NYHA FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION
Heart failure is usually classified according to the severity of the patient’s symptoms. The table 
below describes the most commonly used classification system, the New York Heart Association 
(NYHA) functional classification. It places patients  in 1 of 4 categories based on how much they 
are limited during physical activity.
Class Patient Symptoms
INo limitation of physical activity. Ordinary phys ical activity does 
not cause undue fatigue, palpi tation, or dyspnea (shortness of 
breath).
IISlight limitation of physical activit y. Comfortable at rest. Ordinary 
physical activity results in fatigue, palpi tation, or dyspnea 
(shortness of breath).
IIIMarked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Less 
than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea.
IVUnable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. 
Symptoms of heart failure at rest. If any physical activity is 
undertaken, discomfort increases.
Class Objective Assessment
ANo objective evidence of cardiovascular disease. No symptoms 
and no limitation in ordinary physical activity.
BObjective evidence of minimal cardiovascular disease. Mild 
symptoms and sli ght limitation duri ng ordinary activity. 
Comfortable at rest.
CObjective evidence of moderately severe cardiovascular disease. 
Marked limitation in activity due to symptoms, even during 
less-than-ordinary activity. Comfortable only at rest.
DObjective evidence of severe cardiovascular disease. Severe 
limitations. Experiences symptoms even while at rest.

Overall Rationale for the Revised Protocol 01, 24-Mar-2020
The primary reasons for these changes are to align with current clinical practice, align with recent 
updated international guidelines for assessing hormone receptor status in breast cancer, enhance 
exploratory objectives, enhance capture of relevan t biomarkers at baseline, provide clarifications 
for study conduct, reduce participant burden, and ensure that the protocol is consistent with internal 
BMS policies and operating procedures. Addition al amendments, including to sections of the 
Synopsis, have been made to align the protocol with respect to these changes.
The key updates include the following:
•Updated tumor assessment criteria to reflect modified RECIST v1.1 criteria relevant for
the neoadjuvant setting.
•Updated the histologic Grade 2 low ER expression subgroup to be defined as Grade 2 with
an ER expression level 1-10% to align wi th recently updated ASCO-CAP guidance on
hormone r eceptor testing in breast cancer.
•Allow flexibility for use of breast MRI as an alternate method of tumor assessment duringstudy conduct if it is the local sta ndard instead of breast ultrasound and mammogram.
•Updated window for pr imary breast lesion tumor sample to be ≤90 days prior to enrollment
for FFPE blocks or ≤ 60 days for cut unstained slides submitted at baseline.

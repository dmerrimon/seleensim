 4 Study Schema  
 
A phase II, single -arm trial to examine the efficacy of  prophylactic  low-level laser therapy  
(LLLT)  to reduce the incidence of oral mucositis and adverse events  in patients receiving 
combined modality therapy consisting of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for head and neck 
cancer.  
 
Patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be enrolled to receive prophylactic LLLT in addition 
to standard of care measures fo r oral mucositis or other toxicity of therapy. The radiation and 
chemotherapy dose, schedule, modality, technique, and any required adjustments will not be 
influenced by this protocol and will follow standard existing institutional practices.  
 
Patients wi ll receive LLLT three times per week concurrently with chemoradiotherapy. LLLT 
may be delivered either immediately prior to or after the patient’s daily fraction of radiotherapy. 
Patients will be treated extra -orally with a THOR® LED  cluster for one minute  along the buccal 
mucosa on each side and intraorally for one minute to the tongue and soft palate. During each 
LLLT treatment session a thorough oral exam will be performed to identify any areas of 
mucositis. If the patient should develop intraoral lesion s they will be targeted directly with the 
intraoral probe for one minute to each site of mucositis. The laser settings to be used are as 
follows: frequency 2.5 Hz; wavelength 660 nm; and power 75 mW, for an energy  of 4.5 J.  
 
Patients will be evaluated pri or to therapy, weekly during therapy, two weeks after the 
completion of therapy, and three months after the completion of therapy. During each 
assessment, the following toxicities will be assessed: pain, mucositis, dysphagia, xerostomia, 
dysgeusia, dermati tis, trismus, and quality of life.   
 
Previous studies indicate that approximately 40% of patients will experience severe mucositis 
with radiation and concurrent chemotherapy. The hypothesis in this trial is that the addition of 
LLLT to this treatment regi men will decrease the rate of severe acute  OM to 20%. We plan to 
enroll 50 patients at our institution in 12 months after the trial opens.   
 
 
 
 
 
  
 5 1.0 Objectives:  
 
1.1 Primary Objective  
 
Our primary objective is t o determine  the ability of low -level laser therap y (LLLT) to 
reduce the rates of severe oral mucositis  in patients receiving radiation  with concurrent  
chemotherapy  for head and neck cancer  (HNC) .  
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
1. To establish the time to onset of severe oral mucositis following the initiation of 
radiotherapy  with LLLT .  
2. To determine t he incidence of pain, dysphagia, xerostomia, dysgeusia, trismus, 
radiodermatitis, and OM -related QOL (via FACT -H&N score)  with LLLT .   
3. To evaluate the m ean cumulative radiation do se at time of onset of severe oral 
mucositis  with LLLT . 
4. Determine the d uration of oral mucositis.  
5. Record the a mount of narcotic analgesia use during treatment.  
6. Evaluate the number of  breaks in chemoradiotherapy  with LLLT use.  
7. Determine the p roportion of patients who require feeding tube placement during 
treatment .  
2.0 Introduction  
 
2.1 Disease Overview  
 
Combined modality therapy with chemotherapy and radiation is a commonly employed 
treatment approach for patients with various types of HNC  [1]. Despite the overall safety 
and efficac y of this treatment modality, side effects  exist, including acute 
chemo radiation -induced  pain, dermatitis, xerostomia, dysgeusia,  dysphagia,  
odynophagia, and oral mucositis . In fact, a majority  of patients treated with this modality 
will experience some degree of oral mucositis (OM) [2]. OM can affect many oral 
functions including mastication and swallowing which may lead to dehydration, renal 
failure a nd necessitate the placement and use of a feeding tube and negatively impact and 
patient’s quality of life (QOL).  Severe OM can also predispose a patient to increased risk 
of infections requiring hospitalization and increased cost of treatment  [3]. The severity of 
these reactions can be so severe that p atients who experience treatment -related mucositis 
are less likely to complete the planned course of therapy wi thout unplanned interruptions  
in therapy. Previous studies provide evidence  that unplanned breaks in radiotherapy  for 
HNC result in worse tumor control [4]. Furthermore, adverse events can increase the cost 
of healthcare by resulting in preventable hospital admissions for i ntravenous hyd ration 
and nutritional support and procedures i ncluding feeding tube placement. In fact, OM has 
 6 been shown to be associated with an incremental cost of $1,700 - $6,000 per patient, 
depending on the grade [5].  
 
Despite multiple clinical trials, no single treatment has been proven to be effective in 
substantially reducing incidence or severity of chemoradiation induced oral mucositis.  
The current standard practice for the management of OM is  symptom manag ement and 
supportive care  with narcotic pain medications and anesthetic mouth rinses and 
nutritional support with supplementation either by mouth or feeding tube .  
 
2.2 Product Background  
 
Photomedicine utilizing low level laser (or “light” a s light emitting diode sources are 
increasingly being used in place of lasers) therapy (LLLT) has been investigated as a 
novel therapeutic approach since the 1960s. LLLT is a safe, low -intensity form of light 
therapy. LLLT employs visible (generally red) o r near -infrared light generated from a 
laser or light emitting diode (LED) [6]. Therapy  with LLLT  has been shown to relieve 
pain, reduce inflammation , and improve tissue repair.  LLLT does not function through 
ablative or thermal mechanisms, but rather a photochemical effect comparable to 
photosynthesis in plants whereby the light is absorbed and exerts a chemical change [6].  
 
LLLT was first completely limited to treatment with laser sources, such as the helium 
neon (HeNe) or indium phosphide, gallium and aluminum diode  (InGaAIP) lasers. The 
non-coherent light produced by light emitting diode (LED) devices has the same 
biological properties and clinical effectiveness as coherent light produced by lasers, with 
the advantages of LED  technology being that it is significantly less expensive and can be 
arranged in arrays permitting greater surface area exposure and subsequent shorter 
overall treatment times. Furthermore, LED -based LLLT applied extraorally has good 
penetration through sk in and soft tissue to the oral mucosa [7] 
 
2.3 Product Mechanism of Action  
 
The mechanism of action no LLLT is rooted in photochemistrisy. Light photons must be 
absorbed by molecular photoacceptors or chromophores for photochemistry to occur [8]. 
The cellular mechanism of LLLT has been attributed to the absorption of monochromatic 
visible and near infrared (NIR) radiation by the ce llular respiratory chain [9]. 
Phototherapy is characterized by its ability to induce ph otobiological processes in cells. 
Mitochondria play a crucial role in cellular metabolism and the generation of energy in 
the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) through oxidative phosphorylation. 
Mitochondr ia have been studied as the  main target of photo therapy. Cytochrome c 
oxidase is the proposed photoacceptor for the red -NIR light range in mammalian cells, as 
absorption spectra for light were found to be similar to the absorption spectra of 
cytochrome c oxidase [10]. LLLT to isolated mitochondria increased ATP synthesis, 
RNA and protein synthesis, and enhanced synthesis of NADH and ATP  [6]. In stressed 
tissues, mitochondria make nitric oxide that  competes with oxygen in the oxidative 
phosphorylation chain. This in turn decreases ATP synthesis and can increase production 
 7 of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are small molecules that are highly reactive 
with proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. ROS are potentially harmful to intracellular 
elements and their formation triggers cellular sensors that  can engage signaling pathways 
involved in gene transcription (such as nuclear factor κB (NF -κB). While the exact 
mechanism of action is unknown, LLLT has been shown  to interact with cytochrome c 
oxidase in mitochondria to release nitric oxide, facilitating oxidative phosphorylation. 
This increases  ATP production and stimulates  downstream signals to pr oduce 
antioxidants and growth factors for cell ular repair and prolifer ation. As a result, LLLT 
has been shown to decrease pain and inflammation and promote wound healing and 
tissue repair.  
 
2.4 Product Efficacy  
 
LLLT is a non -invasive technique which has been examined for the prevention and 
treatment of radiotherapy -induced OM. Multiple randomized trials have shown a 
reduct ion in  the rates of  OM and pain  with the use of LLLT [11-20]. A list of trials 
examining the impact of LLLT for OM prevention in patients with HNC is given in table 
1.  
 
Furthermore, a systematic review and meta -analysis of eleven randomized placebo -
controlled trials of LLLT use during chemotherapy or radiation therapy in HNC patients 
was performed [21]. This found a relative risk for developing OM was significantly 
(p=0.02) reduced after LLLT compared with placebo. T he number of days wi th OM 
grade 2 or worse was  also significantly reduced after LLLT to 4.38 days less than 
placebo.  Likewise, OM severity was reduced after LLLT compared with  placebo. All 
studies  in this meta -analysis  recorded  possible adverse effects  of LLLT therapy , but there 
were no  differences  from treatment with placebo . Evidence from these small, randomized 
control led trials show s a significant reduction in incidence and severity of OM for HNC 
patients.   
 
Additionally , the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and 
International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO) Clinical Practice Guidelines for 
Mucositis recommends in favor of LLLT for the prevention of OM in patients receiving 
high-dose chemotherap y for hematopoietic stem cell transplants with or without total 
body irradiation and a suggestion for LLLT in the prevention of OM in patients receiving 
RT for HNC [22]. No guideline was issued for patients receiving concurrent 
chemotherapy and radiation t herapy for HNC due to lack of high -level  evidence. The 
European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) clinical practice guidelines for the 
management of oral  and gastrointestinal mucositis also advises  the use of LLLT  to reduce 
the incidence of oral mucositi s and its associated pain, in patients receiving high -dose 
chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy  before hematopoietic stem cell transplant  [23].

 9 2.5 Product Safety  
 
Lasers used for LLLT are categorized  as Class 3b. Class 3b lasers emit 5mW to 500mW lasers, with 
some emitting infrared light below 5mW. A class 3b laser may be hazardous under direct and specular 
viewing conditions, but is not a fire hazard. The patient and LLLT operator require use of protect ive 
eyewear . The LLLT  system  is equipped with a key switch and a safety interlock.  The THOR ® Laser 
system  (THOR Photomedicine Ltd, Chesham, UK)  that will be used to deliver LLLT in this protocol 
is an FDA -approved medical device  (510(K) number K030226).   
 
There has been no reported toxicity in any of the studies of LLLT for the prevention and/ or 
management of oral mucositis. In the limited number of studies evaluating extraoral LLLT, there has 
similarly been no reported cutaneous or oral toxicity.  
 
2.6 Rationale for the Study  
 
Previous phase III trials conducted in other countries , primarily Brazil [11], France [14], and India  
[16], have  shown  a significant  improvement in OM with LLLT. However, no U.S. trials have been 
reported. The rationale for this phase II trial is to validate the results from international trials in a U.S. 
cohort of patients. Therefore, o ur goal is to evaluate  the efficacy of LLLT in reducing  treatment 
related toxicities including OM, pain, xerostomia, dysgeusia , and dysphagia  and improving OM -
related QOL  in patients undergoing radiation with chemotherapy for HNC .  To accomplish our goal, 
we propose a prospective , single -arm, phase II trial with the aim of improving health -care quality and 
reducing the incidence  of treatment -related toxicity as compared to historical controls  and a matched 
pair of control patients  from our own institution . 
3.0    Selection and Withdrawal of Subjects  
 
3.1 Study Design  
 
This is a p hase II p rospective , single -arm, open label trial testing the efficacy of LLLT in prevention 
of oral mucositis for HNC patients treated with chemoradiotherapy . Primary endpoints are the 
incidence of severe ( assessed separately as CTCAE v. 4.0 grade 3 -5 or WHO grade 3 -4) OM in 
patients receiving  a cumulative radiation dose of at least 5000 cGy. Secondary endpoints include the 
time onset to severe OM, mean cumulative radiation dose at the time of OM, duration of OM, the 
incidence of pain, dysphagia, xerostomia, dysgeusia, trismus, radiodermatitis, and QOL.  
 
All toxicities will be graded by NCI CTCAE v. 4.0. In addition, oral mucositis will also be graded by 
WHO mucositis grading scale. Dysphagia will also be graded by a dietary asses sment. Trismus will 
be assessed by measurments of the interincisal distance . QOL will be measured by the FACT -H&N 
assessment.  
 
Previous studies (detailed in Section 2.2 , Table 1) indicate  that approximately 40% of patients will 
experience severe OM with radiation and concurrent chemotherapy. The hypothesis in this trial is that 
the addition of LLLT to this treatment regimen will decrease the rate of severe acute OM to 20%. We 
plan to enrol l 50 patients at our institution in 12 months after the trial opens.

4.1 Radiation Treatment  
 
Prior to treatment, all patients will provide informed written for radiation therapy as per existing 
institutional policy.  All patients will undergo a computed tomography (CT) simulation for treatment 
planning. Radiation therapy will be delivered with an intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) 
technique  and/or image -guided radiation therapy (IGRT) . The prescribed course of radiotherapy will 
not be a ltered based on this study.  Radiotherapy will  be delivered 5 days per week, Monday – Friday  
with one radiation treatment given per day . The planned cumulative dose of radiation will be 
determined by the treating  physician and will range from 5 000 – 7000 cGy in 180 - 200 cGy daily 
fraction s over the course of 5 -7 weeks. This treatment is not part of the research protocol.  
 
4.1.1  Definition of Target Volumes:  
 
Target volumes will be outlined  per institutional practice and not modified based on this protoco l. 
Target volumes are defined as the following:  
Gross Tumor Volume (GTV)  represents the region judged to contain gross primary tumor or involved 
node(s) based on clinical a nd endoscopic examinations, CT scan, and, when applicable, other imaging 
techniques.  
Clinical Target Volume (CTV)  is defined as the GTV  plus areas considered at risk for containing 
microscopic disease delineated by the treating physician.  The CTV margins can be narrower when 
GTV is in the proximity of the spinal  cord or critical normal tissues.  
Planning Target Volume (PTV) represents an additional margin around the CTV to compensate for 
the vari ability of treatment set up and  internal organ motion.    
 
4.1.2  Definition of Organs at Risk:  
 
CT-based planning will be used to identify the target volumes and organs at risk (OARs). OARs will 
be contoured according to the DAHANCA , EORTC, GORTEC, HKNPCSG, NCIC CTG, NCRI, 
NRG Oncology, and TROG consensus guidelines [24] which are included in table 2 which is 
provided in appendix  11.3.  The d ose parameters  given to OAR s will be recorded (table 3). Dose 
limits to OARs will be determined by institutional practice and specific dose -constraints will no t be 
required on this protocol. The following radiation d oses will be recorded.

4.2 Chemotherapy  
 
Prior to treatment, all patients will provide informed written for chemotherapy as per existing 
institutional policy. The prescribed course of chemotherapy will be determined by the managing 
medical oncologist per institutional practices and will not be altered based on this study. The 
frequency  and dose of chemotherapy will be recorded for each patient on the trial. This treatment is 
not part of the research protocol.  
 
4.3 Low -Level Laser Therapy  
 
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. While there are no expected toxicities, 
potential adverse events will be monitored per Section 7 (Adverse Events and Safety Monitoring). No 
investigational agents or therapies for the prevention of ora l mucositis other than those described in 
this protocol may be administered.  
 
LLLT will be delivered with  the THOR® Laser system  (THOR Photomedicine Ltd, Chesham, UK) . 
LLLT will begin on the first or second day  of radiotherapy and be delivered three times  per week 
(Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) until the completion of radiotherapy. A trained radiation oncology 
nurse or physician will deliver treatment. LLLT may be delivered either immediately prior to or after 
the patient ’s daily fraction of radiotherapy. Patients will be treated extra -orally with a THOR® LED 
 13 cluster  for one minute  along the  cheek to treat the  buccal  mucosa  on each side  and intraorally f or one 
minute to the tongue and soft palate.  During each LLLT treatment session a thorough oral exam will 
be performed to identify any areas of mucositis. If the patient should develop intraoral lesions they 
will be targeted directly with the intraoral pro be for one minute to each site of mucositis.   
 
The laser settings to be used are  as follows: frequency 2.5 Hz; wavelength 660 nm; and power 75 
mW. The dose per anatomic site treated will be 4.5 J /cm2.  
 
The extra -oral probe will be cleaned before and after  each use . Prior to  each use, the intraoral probe 
will be covered with a protective dental sleeve. Patients and laser operator will wear THOR® laser 
safety glasses for the duration of laser therapy.  
 
Treatment dates and sites will be  recorded for each patient on the LLLT Treatment Record F orm 
given in the appendix  (appendix 11 .4). Compliance with therapy will be documented.  For each 
treatment session, the dose will be set (timer on control unit) and the patient will be positioned 
comf ortably a chair. The LLLT device will be for a minimum of 3 exposures:  
  
1. Right cheek   
2. Left cheek   
3. Tongue/Soft palate  
 
The treatment per site will take 60 seconds, for a minimum treatment time of three minutes. If any 
areas of mucositis are eviden t on examination at the time of LLLT treatment, each area will be 
targeted with an intraoral probe for an additional 60 seconds.  
  
There will be no pre - or post -treatment measures/precautions.  
 
4.4 Other treatments  
 
Subjects that develop symptomatic mucositis will be managed as necessary according to standard 
standard of care hospital protocol for oral mucositis in addition to LLLT. This may include topical 
creams, pain medications, anesthetic mouth rinses, mouth coat ings, and nutritional support with 
supplementation either by mouth or feeding tube , without the use of specific investigational, restricted 
agents. No standard treatment will be denied to a patient on this protocol.  
5.0 Follow -up and Assessments  
 
5.1 Follow up Schedule  
 
A general history & physical by a r adiat ion oncologist and/or medical  oncologist must be done within 
8 weeks prior to registration.  Patients will be evaluated for protocol eligibility at the time of initial 
consultation. At the time of initial evaluation, baseline assessments  will be performed. During the 
course of treatment, each patient will be seen by the supervising physician in cl inic for an on -
treatment evaluation at least once per week (or at an interval of once per five radiation treatments).  
Follow -up appointments will be scheduled for two weeks and three months after the completion of 
therapy.

Quality of Life  
QOL will be a ssessed at the time of enrollment prior to initiation of treatment, on the last day of 
treatment, and on the last day of study participation, 3 months after completion of radiation. This will 
be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: G eneral ( FACT -G) version 4  
(Appendix 11.7).  
 
QOL as related to head and neck cancer will be assessed at each follow -up ap pointment using the

6.0 Statistical Considerations  
6.1 Primary E ndpoint s: 
 
• The incidence of severe ( WHO grade 3 -4) oral mucositis in patients treated to a cumulati ve 
radiation dose of at least 50 00 cGy.  
• The incidence of severe ( CTCAE v. 4.0 grade 3 -5) oral mucositis in patients treated to a 
cumulative radiation dose of at least 5000 cGy.  
 
6.2 Secondary Endpoints:  
 
• Time to onset of severe (CTCAE v. 4.0 grade 3 -4) oral mucositis following the initiation of 
radiotherapy.  
 17 • Mean cumulative radiation dose at time of onset of severe (CTCAE v. 4.0 grade 3 -4) oral 
mucositis.  
• Duration of oral mucositis.  
• The incidence of pain .   
• The incidence of dysphagia (CTCAE v. 4.0 and via diet assessment) . 
• The incidence of xerostomia (CTCAE v. 4.0) . 
• The incidence of dysgeusia  (CTCAE v. 4.0).  
• The incidence of trismus (Measurement of interincisal distance).  
• The inciden ce of radiodermatitis  (CTCAE v. 4.0).   
• Evaluation of OM -related QOL (via FACT -H&N score).   
• Incidence of any grade oral mucositis in patients treated to a cumulati ve radiation dose of at 
least 50 00 cGy.  
 
6. 3 Exploratory Endpoints:  
 
• Proportion of patients with severe (CTCAE v. 4. 0 grade 3 -4) oral mucositis by 5 000 and 7000 
cGy.  
• Proportion of patients with severe (CTCAE v. 4.0 grade 3 -4) oral mucositis by schedule of 
chemotherapy given  (weekly versus Q 3 weeks ). 
• Time to reach planned dose of radiation thera py.  
• Amount of narcotic analgesia use during treatment.  
• Assessments of breaks in treatment defined as one of the following:  
o Missing at least 1 chemotherapy treatment;  
o Dose reduction in planned cisplatin administration; OR  
o 3 consecutive days of no RT secondary to mucositis.    
• Prop ortion of patients who require  feeding tube  placement during treatment (excluding 
patients who received a prophylactic feeding tube prior to the initiation of therapy).  
• Percent change in body weight during the course of treatment.  
 
6.4 Sample Size  
 
Previous studies (detailed in Section 2.2, Table 1) indicate  that approximately 40% of patients will 
experience severe OM with radiation and concurrent chemotherapy. The hypothesis in this trial is that 
the addition of LLLT to this treatment regimen will decrease the rate of severe acute OM to 20%. A 
sample size of 45 yields 90% power to detect a difference of 0.20 using an exact one -sided binomial 
test with a Type I error of 0.05. A total of  50 patients  are required  to ensure t hat there are at least 45 
compliant with the treatment schedule. All patients should be enrolled in 12 months after the trial 
opens.  We plan to enroll 50 patients at our institution.  
 
6.5 Analysis  
 
Primary endpoint  
If 12 or fewer out of the 45 evaluable se vere OM events occur, we will reject the null hypothesis that 
the occurrence of severe OM is 0.4 with the addition of LLLT therapy. Point and 90% confidence 
intervals (using Wilson’s method) will also be estimated to describe the primary endpoint.  
 
Seconda ry endpoints  
 18 Descriptive statistics (point and exact 90% confidence interval estimates from the resultant Kaplan -
Meier curve) will be generated for the time -to-severe OM and duration of severe OM endpoints. Point 
and 90% confidence intervals (using Wilson’ s method) will also be estimated to describe the binary 
endpoints. Continuous endpoints will be described by 90% confidence intervals using the t -
distribution.  
 
Exploratory endpoints  
Similar descriptive analyses as described in the above paragraph will be used for the binary, time -to-
event and continuous endpoints.  
 
6.6 Evaluation of T oxicity  
 
All registered patients will be evaluated for toxicity probably related to the treatment. There have 
been no reported toxicities directly attributed to intraoral or extraoral LLLT. No systemic toxicities 
(e.g fever, nausea, fatigue) are anticipated or have been reported in association with oral LLLT. No 
specific toxicity is expected attributable to LLLT due to the addition of LLLT in patients receiving 
radiation with concurrent chemotherapy. Toxicity data will be collected at least weekly during the 
course of treatment to ensure the validity of this claim.  
 
6.7 Specific Toxic O utcomes  
 
No toxicities or dose -limiting toxicities  have been reported in association with LL LT in  the 
biomedical literature.  Specifically with respect to LLLT for the prevention and/or management of oral 
mucositis, no toxicities or DLTs have been reported. Any toxicities arising would be anticipated to be 
localized to the exposed tissues. These w ould include undesignated  skin/mucosal changes, such as 
localized skin erythema, mucosal swelling (not typically associated with mucositis) or unanticipated 
sensory changes. Of note, oral mucositis may develop despite LLLT and will not be considered a 
treatment -related toxicity.  
 
We will closely monitor the following outcomes: grade 3 oral dysesthesia (burning/tingling sensation 
in the distribution exposed to LLLT), g rade 3 or 4 oral mucosal swelling not attributable to mucositis 
(GI Disorders, other,  speci fy), Grade 3 erythema and/or pain of the skin (in the distribution exposed 
to LLLT) ,visual loss, blurred vision, retinal tear or detachment, uveitis, or other eye disorders . If 2 or 
more patients out of the first 10 (or fewer) treated in the phase II porti on of the study develop a grade 
III (using the CTCAE guidelines) or higher toxicity in any of these categories that are probably or 
definitely related to the LLLT treatment received within the first 2 weeks after the completion of 
treatment, we would recom mend revisiting the study for safety reasons. Adjudication is necessary to 
ensure that we judge this study based on adverse events that are specific to LLLT therapy and not any 
other therapy that the patient happens to receive. We will continue to monitor these specific toxic 
outcomes throughout the course of the trial, in a sliding window fashion.  
 
6.8 Other toxic outcomes  
 
Data on other toxic side effects (excluding those detailed in the previous paragraph) that patients may 
experience will also be colle cted. We have chosen a safety threshold of 0.25 to monitor other toxic 
side effects. We would recommend reconsidering the phase II portion of the study for safety reasons 
if there were X many occurrences of grade 3 or higher toxicity (using the CTCAE guide lines) among 
the first N (or fewer) patients treated, as it would result in an upper confidence limit greater than 0.25:  
 19  
N X p UCL  
8 1 0.125  0.255  
13 2 0.154  0.256  
18 3 0.167  0.253  
22 4 0.181  0.261  
27 5 0.185  0.256  
32 6 0.188  0.252  
36 7 0.194  0.256 
41 8 0.185  0.252  
 
In the above table, N = the number of patients treated; X = the cumulative number of patients with a 
grade 3 or higher toxicity currently observed; p = the observed toxicity rate; and UCL = the exact 1 -
sided upper 80% confidence limit for p, u sing Wilson's method without a continuity correction. After 
treating 41 patients, the potential toxicity risk of this regimen should be well defined, and thereafter 
the possible need for termination of the study based on toxicity should be minimal.  
6.9 Expected accrual rate, accrual duration, and study duration  
 
Our anticip ated accrual rate at our center is 50 patients per year .  Thus, it should take approximately 1 
year to accrue the maximum 50 patients needed for the data analysis . Allowing for 2 weeks of  follow -
up to obtain the primary endpoint on the last patient enrolled and 4 months to assemble, analyze and 
interpret the data the total study duration is projected to be at most 1.5 years.  
 
7.0 Adverse Events and Safety Monitoring  
 
There have been no reported toxicities directly attributed to oral LLLT for the prevention/ 
management of mucositis. Any toxicity would be expected to be localized to the region exposed (e.g. 
erythema of the skin, hyperalgesia). We do not anticipate treatm ent-related toxicit y. LLLT has never 
been demonstrated to exacerbate or potentiate mucositis. Regardless, subjects will be followed 
carefully for any possible toxicity.  Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of 
every clinical trial. These will be follo wed per Univ. of Pitt sburgh  requirements.  
 
7.1 Reporting of Serious Treatment Emergent Adverse Events  
 
An adverse event for the purposes of this protocol is the appearance of (or worsening of any pre -
existing) undesirable sign(s), symptom(s), or medical c ondition(s) occurring after signing the 
informed consent even if the event is not considered to be related to the study drug(s). Please refer to 
the adverse event section of the protocol for the protocol -specific definitions of study drug and study 
treatme nt. 
 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI CTCAE version 4.0 will be utilized for 
AE reporting.  All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 
4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded fro m the CTEP web site 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
If CTCAE grading does not exist for an adverse event, the severity of  mild, moderate, severe, and 
life-threatening, or grades 1 - 4, will be used. Adverse event monitoring should be continued for at 
least 3 months following the last LLLT treatment.  
 
• ‘Expectedness’ : AEs can be ‘Unexpected’ or ‘Expected’ for expedited repor ting purposes only.  
 20   
• Attribution  of the AE:  
- Definite – The AE  is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE  is likely related  to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE  may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE  is doubtfully related  to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE  is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 
Adverse events (but not serious adverse events) occurring before starting study treatment but after 
signing the informed consent form will be  recorded as part of the medical history or current medical 
condition. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce 
clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant or require therapy (e.g., any 
hematologic abnormality that requires transfusion or cytokine treatment); and should be recorded on 
the Adverse Events C ase Report Form (CRF)  under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associated with 
them. In addition, isolated abnormal laboratory values that ar e considered clinically significant (e.g., 
cause study discontinuation or constitutes in and of itself a Serious Adverse Event) should be 
recorded on the Adverse Events CRF . SAEs occurring after signing the Informed Consent are 
recorded on the Adverse Even t CRF.  
 
7.2 Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by non -directive questioning of the patient at each 
visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by the patient 
during or  between visits or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments. As far 
as possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine:  
 
1. The severity grade (CTCAE grade 1 -4) 
2. Its relationship to each study treatment  (suspected/not suspected)  
3. Its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam)  
4. Action taken  (no action taken /temporarily interrupted; study treatment  permanently 
discontinued due to this adverse event; concomitant medication taken; non -drug therapy 
given; hospitalization/prolonged hospitalization)  
5. Whether it is serious, where a serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as one which:  
• Is fatal or life -threatening  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless 
hospitalization is for:  
• Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in conditi on (specify what this includes)  
• Elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent  
• Treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an eve nt not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission  
• Social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the patient’s 
general condition  
• Is medically significant, i.e., defined as an e vent that jeopardizes the patient or may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting 
requirements; see protocol section on Serious Adverse Event reporting.  
 21 All adverse events should be treated appropriately. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be 
followed until its resolution, an assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if 
necessary) of any chan ges in its severity, its suspected relationship to the study treatment, any of the 
interventions required to treat it, and its outcome.  
Information about all serious adverse events will be collected and recorded. A serious adverse event is 
an undesirable s ign, symptom or medical condition which:  
• is fatal or life -threatening  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, u nless hospitalization 
is for:  
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration 
in condition (specify what this includes)  
• elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the  indication 
under study and has not worsened since the start of study drug  
• treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of 
a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission  
• social reasons and respite  care in the absence of any deterioration in the patient’s general 
condition  
• is medically significant, i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
 
Event s not considered to be serious adverse events are hospitalizations for the routine treatment 
or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition.  
• Sores in the mouth and throat that are likely to interfere with swallo wing  
• Temporary hair loss (of the face/chin/neck)  
• Tanning, redness, or blistering or peeling of skin in treatment area  
• Loss of teeth, or cavities in teeth, if strict dental care is not followed  
• Hardness and tightness of the skin and muscles of the head and neck  
• Dryness of the mouth or altered taste that may be permanent   
• Loss of appetite  
• Weight loss which may necessitate the placement of a temporary feeding tube  
• Nausea and/or vomiting  
• Weakness  
• Hearing loss, ringing of the ears  
• Numbness of the fingers and toes 
• Lower  blood counts with risk of infection or bleeding  
• Anemia  
• Loss of taste  
• Muscle cramps  
• Loss of coordination  
• Involuntary movement  
• Restlessness  
 
• Treatment, which was elective or pre -planned, for a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen  
 22 • Treatment o n an emergency, outpatient basis for an event  not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of serious given above and  not resulting in hospital admission.  
 
7.3 HRPO  Adverse Event reporting  
 
Invest igators must report the following to the Univ. of Pittsburgh Human Research Protection Office:  
 
• Internal Adverse Events that are (i) Unexpected, (ii) Related or Possibly Related to the 
Research Intervention, and (iii)  serious or otherwise suggests that the research places the 
subject or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic or 
social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
• External Adverse Events that are (i) Unexpected; (ii) Related to the Research Intervention 
and (iii) Serious or otherwise suggests that the research place s subjects or others at greater 
risk than was previously recognized.  
 
Adverse Events that meet the University HRPO ’s reporting requirem ents must be reported to the HRPO  
office as follows:  
• Internal Adverse Events which are unexpected, fatal or life-threatening, and related or 
possibly Related to the Research Interven tion must be reported to the HRPO  within 24 hours 
of learning of the event. (Note: It is recognized that the information available during this 24 
hour period may not be sufficient to  permit accurate completion of the required adverse 
event reporting forms. However, the HRPO  should, at a minimum, be notified of the fatal 
or life -threatening internal adverse event during this time frame, with subsequent followup 
submission of a more det ailed written report.)  
• All other internal Adverse Ev ents will be reported to the HRPO  within 10 working days of 
the investigator learning of the event.  
• External Adverse Events which are Unexpected, Serious AND suggest that the research 
places subjects or o thers at greater risk than was previously recognized, and Related to the 
Research Interven tion will be reported to the HRPO  within 30 working days of their receipt 
by the University/UPMC investigator.  
  
7.4 Data Safety Monitoring  
 
A data safety monitoring  board will meet monthly to ev aluate toxicity for this trial.  
  
During these meetings the investigators will discuss:  
• Safety of protocol participants (adverse events and reporting)  
• Validity and integrity of the data (data completeness on case report forms  and complete source 
documentation)  
• Enrollment rate relative to expectation of target accrual, (eligible and ineligible participants)  
• Retention of participants, adherence to the protocol and protocol violations  
• Protocol amendments  
 
Patients/adverse events will be discussed at these m onthly disease center meetings . Unexpected 
serious adverse events will be reported to the HRPO  and radiation oncology data s afety monitoring 
board  (DSMB ), and minutes of the monthly disease center meeti ngs will be reviewed at th e DSMB  
meetings  
  
 23 Any clinically significant or unexpected disease or condition that is found during the course of this 
study, will be immediately evaluated by the Principal Investigator and appropriate medical staff and 
then it will be determined how to p roceed with the study/ study treatment.  
 
7.5 Ethics  
 
The study will be performed in accordance with ethical pr inciples that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH/Good  Clinical Practice, applicable regulatory 
requirements.

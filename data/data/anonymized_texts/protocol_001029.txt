Name of Active Ingredient: niraparib 
Title of Study: An Open-Label, Non -Randomized, Multicenter Study to Determine the Pharmacokinetics and 
Safety of Niraparib Following a Single Oral Dose in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors and Either Normal 
Hepatic Function  or Moderate Hepatic Impairment  
Study Center(s): Multi-Center 
Principal Investigator:  , MD 
Studied Period (years):  
Estimated date first patient enrolled: January 2018  
Estimated date last patient completed: November 2018  Phase of Development: 1 
 
Objectives:  
Primary: 
• To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of niraparib and its major metabolite (M1) when 
administered as a single dose in cancer patients with normal hepatic function compared to patients with moderate hepatic impairment.  
Secondary:  
• To evaluate the safety of niraparib when administered as a single dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. 
• To obtain additional safety data through the exte nsion phase, in which patients have the option to 
continue receiving niraparib.  
Rationale for Study:  
Niraparib  (ZEJULA ®) is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily by hepatic and renal pathways. The 
purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacokinetics and safety of niraparib in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, for the purpose of providing recommendations  to guide the initial dose and dose titration in this 
patient population.  
Methodology:  
This is a Phase 1, open -label, parallel -group, single -dose study in patients with advanced solid tumors and with 
either normal hepatic function  or moderate hepatic imp airment. 
Patients with solid tumors will be recruited and enrolled within the following groups:  
• Group 1: normal hepatic function (total bilirubin [BILI] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] ≤ upper limit of normal [ULN])  
• Group 2: moderate hepatic impairmen t (BILI >1.5 × to 3 × ULN) and any degree of AST elevation  
PK Phase

Clinical Stud y Protocol 3000-01-003 Amendment 2 
 
Confidential  Page 5 of 71 All patients will receive a single dose of 300 mg niraparib administered as 3 × 100 mg capsules on Day 1. 
Patients will undergo PK sampling up to 168 hours (7 days) following niraparib administration. Pharmacokinetic parameters to be calculated include area under the concentration × time curve calculated to last 
measured concentration  (AUC
0-t), area under the concentration × time curve calculated to infinity  (AUC0-∞), 
maximum concentration  (Cmax), time to maximum concentration ( tmax), terminal half -life (t½), and apparent total 
clearance ( CL/F). Protein binding parameters to be calculated include fraction of unbound drug ( Fu) and 
clearance of free drug (CLfu/F ). The study will be considered  complete when the final PK evaluable patient 
completes all assessments in the PK phase of the study.  
Safety will be assessed through adverse event assessment, physical examination, vital sign measurements, 
clinical laboratory tests , and monitoring of concomitant medications.  
AEs are required to be captured through 30 days after cessation of study treatment; SAEs are required to be captured through 90 days after cessation of study treatment (or to a minimum of 30 days post -treatment if the 
patient starts a lternative anticancer therapy); and any pregnancies that occur within 180 days post -treatment are 
to be captured. Study drug- related SAEs and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) will be collected via 
telephone every 90 ± 14 days after the last dose of study drug until study closeout, or as otherwise indicated in 
AESI, Section 12.2.7. AESIs must be reported as soon as the investigator becomes aware of them. All AEs and 
SAEs experienced by a patient, regardless of the suspected causality, will be monitored until the AE or SAE has 
resolved, until any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline or normalized, until there is a 
satisfactory  explanation for the change(s) observed, until the patient is lost to follow -up or withdraws consent, 
or until the patient has died.  
Extension Phase  
On the same day that patients complete the final study assessments for the PK phase, patients may be eligible to 
continue receiving niraparib in the extension phase of the study, if the investigator believes it is in the best clinical interest of the patient. Patients will receive their first therapeutic dose of niraparib on Cycle 1/Day 1 of 
the extension phase. Patients will return to the study center during Cycle 1 on Days 8, 15, and 21 to undergo 
safety assessments (including complete blood counts [ CBCs]). Thereafter, patients will return on the first day of 
every treatment cycle (28 ±3 days) to receive study  drug and for safety assessments (including CBCs). Dose 
modification (dose interruption and/or reduction) may be implemented for any grade toxicity considered intolerable by the patient, and must be implemented for any Common Terminology Criteria for Adver se Events 
(CTCAE) Grade 3 or 4 non -hematologic adverse event considered by the Investigator related to study treatment 
or for hematologic toxicity as outlined in the protocol. Patients may continue in the extension phase until disease progression (assessed  by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors  [RECIST] v1.1 and clinical 
signs and symptoms ), unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation from the study treatment for any other 
reason. Patien ts in the extension phase will be monitored for AEs, SAEs, and AESIs  according to the same 
schedule as the PK phase. At end of study (EOS), safety assessments will be completed. No new capsules will 
be dispensed at EOS. 
Number of Patients (planned):  16 patients (PK -evaluable)  
Normal hepatic function (Group 1): 8 patients (PK -evaluable)  
Moderate hepatic impairment (Group 2): 8 patients (PK -evaluable)  
Patients may be replaced until there are 8 PK evaluable patients i n each group  of the study.

Additional plasma samples will be drawn for the assessment of unbound concentrations of niraparib and M1 (if 
appropriate) . The following will be calculated for protein binding:  
• Fu: Fraction of unbound niraparib  
• CLfu/F: Clearance of free niraparib  
Blood Sample Collection:  
Blood (approximately 5 mL per sample) will be collected during the study for PK assessments at the follo wing 
time points relative to niraparib dosing: predose (within 30 minutes prior to dosing) and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 
24, 48, 72, 120, and 168 hours  post dose . The following excursions are permitted relative to the protocol-
specified PK sampling times. D eviations outside of these time windows must be documented:  
• Predose: ≤ 30 minutes  
• 1, 2, 3, and  4 hours: ±5 minutes  
• 6, 8, and 12  hours: ±1 5 minutes 
• 24 hours: ±30 minutes  
• 48 and 72 hours: ±60 minutes  
• 120 and 168 hours: ± 120 minutes  
The volume of blood collected for PK assessments for each patient during the study will be approximately 65 
mL. Blood sample collection, processing, and shipping details will be outlined in a separate laboratory manual. 
In brief, blood will be collected in to potassium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (K 3EDTA) tubes, processed 
and plasma analyzed by a validated method of liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC/MS/MS) for determination of the concentrations of niraparib and M1 . The pharmacokinetic 
parameters will be calculated from the plasma concentration -time profiles. The non -compartmental analysis will 
be performed using WinNonlin, version 5.1 or higher.  
Blood (approximately 5 mL per sample) will be collected during the study for plasma protein binding 
evaluations at predose (within 30 minutes prior to dosing) and at 3 hours and 168 hours.  
Safety: 
Safety will be assessed based on adverse events (AEs), phy sical examinations, vital signs, clinical laboratory 
results, and monitoring of concomitant medications.  
Statistical Methods: 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be issued as a separate document, providing detailed methods for the 
safety analyses outli ned in this section. Any deviations from the planned analyses will be described and justified 
in the final integrated clinical study report (CSR).  
Study completion status will be summarized for all patients. Categories summarized will include those patients who were screened, enrolled, completed the study, or discontinued early (including reason for discontinuation).  
Demographic characteristics of all patients enrolled will be summarized descriptively by group and will include age, sex, race, height, and weight.  
Protocol deviations will be listed by patient.  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses:

Confidential  Page 11 of 71 The pharmacokinetic population for the evaluation of the PK of niraparib and M1 in patients with normal 
hepatic function and in patients with hepatic impairment will consist of all patients who receive niraparib and 
have sufficient evaluable samples for the determination of C max, AUC 0-t, and AUC 0-∞.  
Plasma concentrations over time and PK parameters of niraparib will be evaluated after single dose administration. Individual and mean plasma concentrations over time will be plotted by hepatic function group.  
Individual patient PK parameter values will be derived by non -compartmental methods using WinNonlin, 
version 5.1 or higher . Nominal or actual time will be used in the data analysis. Plasma concentrations and PK 
parameters will be summarized in terms of the number of patients, arithmetic mean, standard deviation  (StDev), 
coefficient of variation, median, minimum and maximum by group.  
To assess the effects of hepatic impairmen t on niraparib PK, linear models will be applied to the log -
transformed C
max, and AUC 0-t, AUC 0- ∞. The independent variable in the analyses will be liver function (normal 
hepatic function [control]  or moderate hepatic impairment ). Point estimates and 90% C Is for differences 
between means on the log scale will be exponentiated to express the results as ratios of geometric means on the original scale. Patients with normal hepatic function (Group 2) will be used as reference group to which Group 1 will be compared. No adjustments will be made for multiplicity.  
Box plots of PK parameters (C
max, AUC 0-t, AUC 0- ∞, CL/F, and CLfu/F) by hepatic function group will be 
provided.  
Similar analyses will be performed on M1 if appropriate.  
The effect of hepatic dysfunction  on unbound concentrations of niraparib and M1 may be assessed applying a 
general linear model with a factor for hepatic impairment status.  
Safety Analyses:  
The safety population will consist of all patients who receive drug.  
All data will be summarized by  group. Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
(number of patients, mean, StDev, minimum, median, and maximum). Categorical variables will be summarized 
using counts of patients and percentages.  
All AEs will be listed. The num ber and percent of patients who experienced an AE will be summarized by 
timing/treatment for each system organ class (SOC) and preferred term. AEs will also be tabulated accordingly 
by intensity and causality. Descriptive comparisons of event rates for each group will be presented.  
Serious AEs  (SAEs) will be listed separately.  
All AEs will be coded using the  current version of the  Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
The adverse events of special interest (AESIs) for this study are myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), pneumonitis, embryo -fetal toxicity, and secondary cancer (new malignancies other 
than MDS/AML). AESIs must be reported to the Sponsor as soon as  the Investigator becomes aware of them.  
Individua l data listings of laboratory test results will be presented. Flags will be attached to values outside of the 
laboratory's reference limits along with the Investigator's assessment. Clinically significant laboratory test abnormalities that were considered AEs by the Investigator will be presented in the AE listing.  
Clinical laboratory tests (observed values and changes from baseline) will be summarized descriptively in tabular format. Shift tables will be presented for select laboratory parameters (chemistr y and hematology).

5.1. Background of Niraparib  
Niraparib (ZEJULA ®) is a poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]- ribose polymerase)  (PARP) 
inhibitor indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial 
ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to 
platinum-based chemotherapy. Niraparib received FDA approval in March 2017. For more 
details, refer to ZEJULA® label.1 
In vitro studies have shown that niraparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP 
enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP -deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA) complexes 
resulting in DNA damage, apoptosis and cell death. Increased niraparib-induced cytotoxicity was 
observed in tumor cell lines with or without deficiencies in BRCA1/2. Niraparib decreased tumor 
growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer cell lines with deficiencies in BRCA1/2 and 
in human patient-derived xenograft tumor models with homologous recombination deficiency 
that had either mutated or wild type BRCA1/2. 
Niraparib co-crystallized with the human PARP-1 catalytic domain and w as shown to inhibi t 
PARP-1 and PARP -2 activity in  vitro with an inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 3.8 and 2.1 nM, 
respectively. In cultured cells, niraparib inhibi ted PARP-dependent PARy lation stimulated by 
DNA dam age with an IC50 of 4 nM and an IC 90 of 40 nM. 
The crystalline tosylate monohydrate salt of niraparib is being developed as a monotherapy agent 
for tumors with defects in the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway, as a sensitizing 
agent in combination with cytotoxic agents and radiotherapy, and in combination with immune-oncology biologics.  
Nonclinical data, including cell-derived and patient- derived xenograph studies demonstrating 
response to niraparib in both BRCA mutated (gBRCAmut) and BRCA wild -type (gBRCAwt) 
tumors, are discussed in detail in the Investigator ’s Brochure (IB).  
There are 3 ongoing Phase 3 niraparib studies, Study PR-30-5010- C (BRAVO), 
Study PR -30-5017-C (PRIMA), and Study PR- 30-5011-C (NOVA). There is A also 1 ongoing 
Phase 1/2 study, Study 3000-PN162-01-001 (TOPACIO) and 1 ongoing Phase 2 study, Study 
PR-30-5020- C (QUADRA).  
The ENGOT -OV16/NOV A study
4 is a double-blind, 2:1 (ni raparib:placebo) randomized, 
placebo-controlled study of maintenance t reatment with ni raparib compared with placebo in 
patients with platinum- se nsitive ovarian cancer who have r eceived at least 2 platinum-based 
regimens, had a response to th eir last regimen, and have no m easurable disease >2 cm and 
normal cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) (or >90% d ecrease) following their last treatment. There 
were 2 independent pa tient cohor ts comprising patients who have deleterious g BRCAmut v ersus 
those who have a tumor with high-grade serous histology but without g BRCAmut (non-
gBRCAmut). Patients in the non- g BRCAmut cohort are further characterized by tumor HRD  
status (positive or negative). 
A total of 553 patients were randomized into this Phase 3 study at 107 centers worldwide. The 
st
udy population comprises 203 patients randomized into the g BRCAmut cohort and 350 patients 
randomized into the non-g BRCAmut cohort. Among the 350 patients in the non-g BRCAmut 
Niraparib

Confidential  Page 22 of 71 cohort, 162 had tumors that were defined as HRDpos and 134 had tumors that were HRD 
negative (HRDneg). HRD status was not determined (HRDnd) for 54 patients.  
Demographic and baseline characteristics were well -balanced.  
Table 3 shows the results for the PFS primary endpoint for each of the 3 primary efficacy 
populations (ie, g BRCAmut cohort, HRDpos cohort, and overall non-gBRCAmut cohort). In 
addition, median PFS in patients with HRD negative (HRDneg) tumors was 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.6, 9.6) in the niraparib arm compared to 3.8 months (95% CI: 3.7, 5.6) in the placebo arm with an HR of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.361, 0.922) (p=0.0226).

Progression -free survival is defined as the time in months from the date of randomization to progression or 
death. 
The primary data to support the safety of treatment with niraparib in this proposed indication are 
derived from the ENGOT-OV16/NOVA main study in which a total of 546 patients received 
study treatment. Safety presentations for the NOVA study are derived from the analyses included in the clinical study report and include comparisons of the safety profile of niraparib 
maintenance treatment versus placebo in women with platinum- sensitive recurrent ovarian 
cancer. 
All patients who received niraparib and 171 (96%) of 179 patients who received placebo 
experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). The high rate of TEAEs in the 
placebo group indicates the burden of prior chemotherapy and the patient’s underlying ovarian 
cancer. Review of the data across study cohorts for TEAE incidence showed that, in general,  the 
results were similar in the g BRCAmut and non-g BRCAmut cohorts. In the overall safety 
population, for the niraparib versus placebo treatment arms, the incidences of Grade 3/4 TEAEs (74% vs 23%), serious adverse events (SAEs) (30% vs 15%), TEAEs leading to treatment 
interruption (69% vs 5%), TEAEs leading to dose reduction (67% vs 15%), and TEAEs leading 
to treatment discontinuation (15% vs 2%) were higher for niraparib. There were no on- treatment 
deaths reported. The incidence of myelodysplastic syndrom e (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) in patients who received niraparib (5 of 367; 1.4%) was similar to the incidence in patients who received placebo (2 of 179; 1.1%). MDS/AML and secondary cancers (new malignancies other than MDS or AML) are potential risks of PARP inhibitors.  
Niraparib    
Clinical Stud y Protocol 3000-01-003 Amendment 2 
 
Confidential  Page 23 of 71 The selection of the 300 mg starting dose of niraparib for the phase 3 r andomized double-blind 
trial of maintenance with niraparib versus placebo in the ENGOT -OV16/NOVA study was based 
on data from the Phase 1 MAD study PN001  conducted by Merck & Co. There were no formal 
Phase 2 dose-ranging studies conducted. The Phase 1 study included both a dose escalation 
phase to determine the maximal tolerated dose and an expansion arm to further evaluate the 
selected dose. A total of 104 patients with advanced solid tumors were evaluated in this study, including 60 during dose escalation from 30 mg to 400 mg and 54 during expansion at the 300 mg dose level. The dose escalation stage determined that 400 mg exceeded the maximal tolerated 
dose (by traditional dose-limiting toxicity evaluations and by using the pooled adjacent violators algorithm). No dose- limiting toxicities were observed at 290 or 300 mg dose l evels. In the Phase 
3 study, daily niraparib improved progression-free survival (PFS) in a cohort of patients with 
gBRCA mutation as well as in a cohort of patients without g BRCA mutation. Within the 
gBRCAmut cohort, the median PFS was 21.0 months in patients on niraparib versus 5.5 months 
on placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.27; p < 0.0001). In recurrent ovarian cancer patients, efficacy was assessed in patients with HRD -positive tumors as identified by the Myriad’s myChoice 
HRD test as well in the overall no n-gBRCA mutation cohort regardless of HRD status. As 
observed in the g BRCAmut cohort, PFS was significantly longer with niraparib in the 
homologous recombination deficient-positive group of the non-g BRCAmut (without germline 
BRCA mutation) cohort (median, 12.9 months vs 3.8 months; HR, 0.38; p < 0.0001). Lastly, PFS 
was significantly improved in the overall non-g BRCAmut cohort (median, 9.3 months vs 
3.9 months; HR, 0.45; p < 0.0001). Secondary endpoints, including chemotherapy- free interval, 
time to first s ubsequent therapy (TFST), and progression-free survival 2 (PFS2), confirmed the 
PFS benefit of niraparib treatment in both cohorts. This provides compelling evidence that 
niraparib does not diminish responsiveness to subsequent therapy and that the nirapar ib treatment 
effect persists. Subsequently in 2017, a recommendation to consider niraparib maintenance 
therapy in this setting in cases of CR and PR was added to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN) guidelines.
5  
The most commonly observed non- hematologic treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of 
any National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-
CTCAE) grade were nausea, fatigue, constipation, and vomiting; the majority of the non-
hematologic TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. The most commonly observed 
hematologic TEAEs (any grade) were anemia (48.5%), thrombocytopenia 66.2%), and neutropenia (31.4 %).  
TEAEs leading to treatment interruption, reduction or discontinuation were 68.9%, 66.5% and 14.7% respectively. Approximately 50% of patients required dose interruption during the first 
month of niraparib therapy, and 47% required dose reduction during the second month of 
therapy. Most patients achieved their individual maximal tolerated dose  by the third month. The 
average dose of niraparib during the study was 206 mg. After Month 3 or 4, new incident s of 
thrombocytopenia w ere reported in < 1% of patients. Although Grade 3 or 4 hematologic 
laboratory events were common at the initiation of treatment, no severe clinical sequelae were observed, and relatively few patients discontinued due to these AEs (discontinuation rate was 
3.3% for thrombocytopenia, 1.4% for anemia and 1.9% for neutropenia). Dose adjustment based 
on individual tolerability during the first 3 cycles substantially reduced the incidence of these events beyond Cycle 3. Furthermore, PFS  in patients who were dose reduced to either 200 mg or 
Niraparib    
Clinical Stud y Protocol 3000-01-003 Amendment 2 
 
Confidential  Page 24 of 71 100 mg was consistent with PFS for the patients who remained at 300 mg indicating that patients 
who required dose reduction do not appear to have decreased efficacy relative to those who remain at the 300  mg starting dose.  
These data support that each patient has an optimal benefit /risk at their individualized dose. As 
lower doses are associated with substantial improvements in the incidence of TEAEs while not 
appearing to compromise efficacy, approaches to quickly transition patients to their 
individualized optimal dose , particularly patients at the highest risk of grade 3 or 4 
thrombocytopenia in cycle 1were further evaluated . In addition, an exploratory analysis was 
conducted to determine if risk factors could be identified for a subgroup of pati ents which were 
associated with higher rates of hematologic toxicity.  In the updated analysis, two factors were 
identified as being associated  with thrombocytopenia, baseline platelet count and baseline body 
weight. 
For a complete discussion on the activity and safety of niraparib, refer to the Investigator’s Brochure.  
5.2. Niraparib Metabolism  
In a dose escalation study in cancer patients (PN001), niraparib exhibited linear PK, and dose- 
proportional exposure (AUC and C max). Moreover, the consistent t max and t½ across the range of 
doses evaluated (30-400 mg) suggest overall dose-independent absorption and clearance. 
Following repeat administrations of the daily recommended dose of 300 mg, niraparib 
accumulation on Day 21 was consistent for both AUC and C max (~2-3 folds). Niraparib was 
shown to be highly orally bioavailable (F ~73%) (PR-30-3015-C). A high- fat meal exhibited a 
negligible effect on the extent and rate of absorption niraparib (PR-30-5011- C2-FE); therefore, 
niraparib can be administered with or without food.  
Niraparib was moderately protein bound to human plasma (83.0%) (PK002). The apparent 
volume of distribution (Vd/F) was 1220 L (PR- 30-5015-C), indicating an extensive tissue 
distribution of niraparib. In the population pharmacokinetic analysis of niraparib, the Vd/F was 1074 L in cancer patients. In nonclinical species (PK001), niraparib exhibited a high volume of distribution, i.e. Vd/F ~ 6.9 and 12.3 L/kg in rats and dogs, respectively. It is readily distributed 
to the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of rats and monkeys, respectively (KB-0039- DA-RI 
and PK004). 
A multiple enzyme -mediated metabolism was established in vitro (PK002) and in vivo 
(absorption, metabolism, and excretion [AME] study PR -30- 5015- C). The carboxylesterases -
catalyzed amid e hydrolysis was delineated to be the major primary pathway, followed by the 
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) -mediated glucuronidation and the other minor secondary 
pathway ( i.e. methylation). The major circulating metabolites in humans are the carboxylic acid 
(M1) and the glucuronides of M1. The metabolic profile seen in humans is consistent with what 
was detected in the experimental species (rats and dogs) (PK003).  
In the AME study in cancer patients using 
14C-radioactive niraparib (N = 6, PR-30-5015- C), a 
mean measured total of 86.2% (ranged from 71.1% to 91.0%) of the radioactive dose was recovered in urine and fecal samples collected daily from 0 to 504 hours (21 days) postdose after 
single oral administration of 
14C-niraparib. Total radioactivity recovered in the urine accounted 
for 47.5% (ranged from 33.4% to 60.2%) and in the feces for 38.8% (ranged from 28.3% to 
Niraparib    
Clinical Stud y Protocol 3000-01-003 Amendment 2 
 
Confidential  Page 25 of 71 47.0%) of the dose. Therefore, the overall recovery in the excreta following the continuous 
collection up to 21 days was virtually compl ete, suggestive of minimal long -term retention of 
niraparib or its metabolites. Moreover, hepatobiliary clearance and renal excretion are the major routes of elimination in humans. 
5.3. Rationale for Current Study  
Niraparib is extensively metabolized and elimin ated primarily by hepatic and renal pathways. 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacokinetics and safety of niraparib in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment, for the purpose of providing recommendations to guide the initial 
dose and dose titration in this patient population.

when administered as a single dose in cancer patients with normal hepatic function compared to patients with moderate hepatic impairment.  
6.2. Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate the safety of niraparib when administered as a single dose in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment.  
• To obtain additional safety data through the extension phase, in which patients have 
the option to continue receiving niraparib.

7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 1, open- label, parallel -group, single-dose study in patients with advanced solid 
tumors and with either norm al hepatic function  or moderate hepatic impairment.  
Patients with solid tumors will be recruited and enrolled within the follow ing groups: 
• Group 1: normal hepatic function (total bilirubin [BILI] and aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST] ≤ upper limit of norma l [ULN]) 
• Group 2: moderate hepatic impairment (BILI >1.5 × to 3 × ULN) and any degree of AST elevation  
7.1.1. PK Phase  
All patients will receive a single dose of 300 mg niraparib administered as 3 × 100 mg capsules 
on Day 1. Patients will undergo PK sampling up to 168 hours (7 days) following niraparib 
administration. Pharmacokinetic parameters to be calculated include area under the concentration 
× time curve calculated to last measured concentration (AUC
0-t), area under the concentration × 
time curve calculated  to infinity (AUC 0-∞), maximum concentration (C max), time to maximum 
concentration (t max), terminal half -life (t½), and apparent total clearance (CL/F). Protein binding 
parameters to be calculated include fraction of unbound drug (Fu) and clearance of free drug (CLfu/F). The study will be considered complete when the final PK evaluable patient completes all assessments in the PK phase of the study.  
Safety will be assessed through adverse event assessment, physical examination, vital sign 
measurements, clin ical laboratory tests , and monitoring of concomitant medications (Section  12). 
7.1.1.1. Fasting and Study Drug Administration for the PK Phase  
During the PK Phase of the study, patients should come to the clinic on the morning of Day 1 of the PK period following a 12-hour overnight fast. During the overnight fast, patients are permitted to consume water (but no other beverages) until up to 2 hours prior to dosing of the study drug. Patients may take their routine medications with sips of water.  
Patients will receive a single dose (300  mg) of the formulation with approximately 250 ml of 
water on Day  1 of the PK period. Patients may resume their regular diet 4  hours after taking the 
study drug. 
7.1.2. Extension Phase 
On the same day that patients complete the final study assessments for the PK phase, patients 
may be eligible to continue receiving niraparib in the extension phase of the study, if the 
investigator believes it is in the best clinical interest of the patient. Patients will receive their first 
therapeutic dose of niraparib on Cycle 1/Day 1 of the extension phase.  For patients with normal 
hepatic function, the starting dose of niraparib will be based on the patient’s screening  actual 
body weight or current platelet count . Patients with a screening actual body weight of ≥ 77 
kg and current platelet count of ≥150,000/µL at C1D1 (or at screening if done 72 hours prior to 
C1D1) will take three capsules of 100 mg strength (300 mg/day) at each dose

count of <150,000/µL at C1D1 (or at screening if done 72 hours prior to C1D1 will take two 
capsules of 100 mg strength (200 mg) at each dose administration. Additional dose modifications 
will not be based upon changes in the patient’s actual body weight during study participation. 
Patients with moderately impaired hepatic function will receive an oral daily dose of niraparib 
200 mg (2 × 100- mg capsules).   
Patients will return to the study center during Cycle 1 on Days 8, 15, and 21 to undergo safety 
assessments (including complete blood counts [CBCs]). Thereafter, patients will return on the 
first day of every treatment cycle (28 ±3 days) to receive study drug and for safety assessments 
(including CBCs). Dose modification (dose interruption and/or reduction) may be implemented for any grade toxicity considered intolerable by the patient, and must be implemented for any 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 or 4 non- hematologic 
adverse event considered by the Investigator related to study treatment or for hematologic 
toxicity as outlined in the protocol. Patients may continue in the extension phase until disease 
progression (assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] v1.1 and 
clinical signs and symptoms), unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason. At end of study (EOS), safet y assessments will be completed. No 
new capsules will be dispensed at EOS.  
Table 4 and Table 5 presents the schedule of assessments. Section  7.5 details the procedures to 
be performed on each study day/visit. 
7.2. Number of Patients  
Approximately 16 patients will be enrolled.

Confidential  Page 46 of 71 Additional dose modifications will not be based upon changes in the patient’s actual body weight 
during study participation.  
Extension phase:  Patients with moderately impaired hepatic function will receive an oral daily 
dose of niraparib 200 mg (2 × 100- mg capsules).   
Patients will be instructed to take their niraparib dose at the same time each day. Bedtime 
administration may be a potential method for managing nausea. Patients must swallow and not chew all capsules. The consumption of water and food is permissible. 
Niraparib will be dispensed to patients on Day 1 of every cycle (every 28 days) thereafter until 
the patient discontinues study treatment. The Pharmacy Manual contains descriptions of the packaging of niraparib and instructions for the preparation and administration of niraparib. 
9.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria   
During the extension phase, study treatment dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of adverse events, medical/surgical events or logistical reasons not related to study therapy ( e.g. 
surgery, unrelated medical events, patient vacation, or holidays). Patients should resume study 
therapy within 28 days of the scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the Sponsor. 
All treatment interruptions and dose reductions (including any missed doses) and the reasons for 
the reductions/interruptions are to be recorded in the electronic case report form ( eCRF). 
Dose interruption of niraparib may be implemented at any time per the Investigator’s judgment. See the following sections for permitted duration of interruption prior to required discontinuation from treatment.  
Niraparib dose reduction will be allowed based on treatment side effects. Dose reductions to 1 capsule daily (100 mg) will be allow ed (Table 8). No further dose reductions will be allowed. 
The timing of efficacy or safety evaluations should not be affected by dose interruptions or reductions. 
9.4.1. Niraparib Dose Modifications for Adverse Events  
During the extension phase, dose modification may be implemented by the treating physician at 
any time for any grade of toxicity, when deemed in the best interest of the patient. In the case of 
severe adverse reactions, treatment should be withheld and then resumed per Table 8 and  
Table 9. 
The recommended dose modifications for hematologic adverse reactions are listed i n Table 10.

9.4.2. Niraparib Dose Modifications for Nonhematologic Toxicity 
During the extension phase, treatment with niraparib must be interrupted for any treatment-
related nonhematologic Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 or 4 event. If toxicity is appropriately resolved to Grade 1 or less within 28 days of interruption, the 
patient may restart treatment with niraparib with a dose level reduction ac cording to Table 9 
unless prophylaxis is considered feasible. If the event recurs at a similar or worse grade, 
treatment should be interrupted. 
If the toxicity requ iring dose interruption has not resolved to CTCAE Grade 1 or less during a 
maximum 4 -week (28-day) dose interruption period, or the patient has already undergone a dose 
reduction (to a minimum dose of 100 mg QD), or both, the patient must permanently discontinue 
treatment with niraparib. Once the dose of niraparib has been reduced, any re- escalation must be 
discussed with the Sponsor.

The dose interruption/modification criteria for niraparib for any hematologic toxicities noted 
during the extension phase will be based on blood counts and are outlined in Table 10 (Normal  
Hepatic Function) and Table 11  (Impaired Hepatic Function) . 
If clinically indicated, use of G -CSF is allowed according to current American Society of 
Clinical Oncology ( ASCO) guidelines.5 If clinically indicated, red blood cell transfusions are 
allowed according to institutional guidelines.  
If the hematologic toxicity does not recover to the specified level within 4 weeks (28 days) of dose interruption and/or the patient has already undergone 1 dose reduction (to a minimum dose 
of 100 mg QD), then niraparib should be discontinued.  
Patients with normal hepatic function requiring transfusion of platelets or red blood cells (1 or 
more units) or hematopoietic growth factor support may undergo a niraparib dose reduction upon 
recovery if study treatment is resumed.  
Once the dose of study treatment has been reduced, any re-escalation must be discussed with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor. 
It is strongly recommended that the patient b e referred to a hematologist for further evaluation 
(1) if transfusions are required on more than 1 occasion or (2) if the treatment- related 
hematologic toxicities have not recovered to CTCAE ≤ Grade 1 within 4 weeks. If a diagnosis of 
MDS/AML is confirmed by a hematologist, the patient must permanently discontinue niraparib.  
The reason for interruption, reduction, or discontinuation of niraparib should be recorded in the 
eCRF.

cytokines should not be administered in the first cycle but may be administered in 
subsequent cycles according to current ASCO guidelines.5 
If there is a clinical indication for any  medication specifically prohibited during the study, 
discontinuation from study therapy may be required. The Investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the Sponsor. The final decision on any supportive therapy or 
vaccination rests with the Investigator and/or the patient’s primary physician. The decision to 
continue the patient on study therapy, however, requires the mutual agreement of the 
Investigator, the Sponsor, and the patient. 
The niraparib safety profile includes thrombocytopenia; therefore, use caution with 
anticoagulation and antiplatelet drugs.  
9.5.2. Study Restrictions

Niraparib 100-mg capsules may be packed in high-density polyethylene bottles with 
child-resistant closures or in blister cards. The sponsor is exploring a change in packaging 
configuration to blister cards, which may be implemented at some point during the study.  
The label text of the study treatments will comply with Good Manufacturing Prac tice and 
national legislation to meet the requirements of the participating countries. The study treatment 
will be open-label and non- patient specific. 
All study treatment supplies must be stored in accordance with the Pharmacy Manual instructions and package labeling. Until dispensed or administered to the patients, the study treatment will be stored in a securely locked area, accessible to authorized personnel only. 
10.2. Study Drug Accountability  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for maintaining accurate dispensing records of the study treatments throughout the clinical study. Study drug accountability should be maintained 
by each site based on capsules dispensed vs. returned to the clinic at each visit and the number days since last visit.  
Details of  maintaining drug accountability, including information on the accountability log, will 
be provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
All dispensation and accountability records will be available for Sponsor review. The Study 
Monitor will assume the responsibility to reconcile the study treatment accountability log. The 
pharmacist will dispense study treatment for each patient according to the protocol and 
Pharmacy Manual, if applicable.  
10.3. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
At the end of study ( EOS), when all patients have stopped protocol treatment, complete drug 
reconciliation per batch should be available at the site for verification in order to allow drug 
destruction or return procedure. After receiving the Sponsor’s approval in writing, the 
investigational site is re sponsible for destruction of study drug according to local regulations. If a 
site does not have the capability for on-site destruction, the Sponsor will provide a return for destruction service to a third party. Both the unused and expired study medication must be 
destroyed, upon authorization of the Sponsor, according to local regulations and procedures, and a copy of the destruction form must be filed in the study binder. 
The drug provided for this study is to be used only as indicated in this protocol and only for the

11.1. Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
Pharmacokinetic parameters to be assessed include  the following: 
• AUC0-t: Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to the time of 
the last quantifiable concentration  
• AUC0-∞: Area under the plasma concentration- time curve from time 0 extrapolated to 
infinity 
• Cmax: Observed maximum plasma concentration  
• tmax: Time to Cmax 
• t½: Terminal half-life 
• CL/F: Apparent total body clearance  
Additional plasma samples will be drawn for the assessment of unbound concentrations of 
niraparib and M1. The following will be calculated for protein binding:  
• Fu: Fraction of unbound niraparib 
• CLfu/F: Clearance of free niraparib  
11.2. Blood Sample Collection  
Blood will be collected during the study for PK assessments and protein binding at the 
timepoints relative to niraparib dosing as described in  Table 6. In total, approximately 80 mL of 
blood will be collected from each patient. 
11.2.1. Pharmacokinetic Assessment  
The volume of blood collected for PK assessments from each patient  (approximately 5 mL per 
sample) during the study will be approximately 65 mL. Blood sample collection, processing, and 
shipping details will be outlined in a separate laboratory manual. In brief, blood will be collected 
into potassium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (K 3EDTA) tubes, processed and plasma 
analyzed by a validated method of liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry 
detection (LC/MS/MS) for determination of the concentrations of niraparib and M1. The 
pharmacokinetic parameters (Section  11.1) will be calculated from the plasma concentration -
time profiles. The non-compartmental analysis will be performed using WinNonlin, version 5.1 or higher. 
11.2.2. Plasma Protein Binding  
The total volume of blood collected during the study for plasma protein binding from each patient (approximately 5 mL per sample) will be approximately 15 mL. Blood sample collection, 
processing, and shipping details will be outlined in a separate laboratory manual. In brief, plasma 
protein binding will be performed by equilibrium dialysis (MWCO 10kD). At the end of dialysis, aliquots from both compartments will be analyzed to determine the concentration of the unchanged drug using a modified LC/MS/MS method.

Performance status will be assessed using the ECOG scale ( Appendix 2)  in accordance with the 
schedule of assessments ( Table 4 and Table 5). The same observer should assess performance 
status each time.  
12.2. Adverse Events  
12.2.1. Definitions  
Adverse event (AE):  An AE is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the product. 
AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre- existing medical 
conditions. An AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including 
baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. A TEAE will be 
defined as any new AE that begins, or any preexisting condition that worsens in severity during 
the Treatment Period.  
Serious adverse event (SAE):  A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at 
any dose as follows: 
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening  
− Note: This means that the patient is at immediate risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitali zation 
• Any AE that prolongs hospitalization will be considered an SAE. 
− Exception: Preplanned hospitalization ( e.g. for observation, protocol compliance, 
elective procedures, social reasons) will not be considered an SAE; however, the 
reason for the planned hospitalization should be captured in medical history section of the eCRF . Complications experienced during these hospitalizations 
must be reported as AEs (or SAEs, if hospitalization is prolonged due to the AE). 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol 3 000-01-003 Amendment 2 
Confidential  Page 57 of 71 • Is an important medical event(s)  
− Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in determining whether 
situations or events should be considered serious adverse events; An important 
medical event may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or require intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. (See section 12.2.5 for information about SAE 
reporting)  
Treatment -Emergent  Adverse Events (TEAEs) : Any event that was not present prior to the 
initiation of study treatment or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to study treatment. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI):  Any AE (serious or non- serious) that is of 
scientific and medical co ncern specific to the study treatment, for which ongoing monitoring and 
rapid communication by the investigator to the Sponsor is appropriate. Special Situations: Abuse, Misuse, Medication Errors, Overdose, and Accidental or 
Occupational Exposure: 
• Abuse: the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of the study treatment 
which is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects.  
• Misuse: medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance 
with the authorized/approved product information. 
• Medication error:  any preventable incident that may cause or lead to inappropriate 
study treatment use or patient harm while the study treatment is in the control of the 
health care professionals or patients. Such incident may be due to health care 
professional practice, product labeling, packaging and preparation, procedures for administration, and systems, including the following: prescribing, order 
communication, nomenclature, compounding, dispensing, distribution, 
administration,  education, monitoring, and use. 
• Overdose:  a deliberate or accidental administration of study treatment to a study 
patient, at a dose greater than that which was assigned to that patient per the study 
protocol and under the direction of the Investigator.  If an overdose occurs, the 
Investigator and the Sponsor should be notified immediately, and the patient should be observed closely for AEs. Associated AEs should be treated and monitored by the 
Investigator. The dosage of study drug administered, any associated AEs, and/or 
treatment provided to the patient because of the overdose, should be documented on the applicable sections within the eCRF. An overdose (including an AE or SAE resulting from the overdose, if any) will be reported as described in Section  
• Accidental /Occupational exposure:  the unintentional exposure to a study treatment 
as a result of one's professional or non-professional occupation, or accidental exposure to a non-professional to whom exposure was not intended (i.e. study product given to wrong patient).  
Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol 3 000-01-003 Amendment 2 
Confidential  Page 58 of 71 Reporting Special Situations:  All occurrences of abuse, misuse, medication error, overdose, and 
accidental or occupational exposure with any study treatment must be reported on an SAE 
Report Form [or designated Special Form] to the Sponsor regardless of whether or not an AE or SAE has occurred. If the abuse, misuse, medication error, overdose, or accidental / occupational 
exposure is associated with an SAE, an SAE report form must be submitted to the Sponsor 
within 24 hours of awareness. If there is no AE or SAE, the occurrence must be submitted on the designated Special Form (indicate ‘no AE has occurred’) as soon as possible.
 
12.2.2. Assessment of Adverse Events  
12.2.2.1. Severity Assessment  
All AEs will be assessed by the Investigator for severity according to Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03: 14 June 2010; National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI). The CTCAE severity grades 1 through 5 provide unique clinical 
descriptions of severity of each ad verse event. The CTCAE v4.03 is available on the NCI/NIH 
website. 
Please note that there is a distinction between serious and severe AEs: Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section  12.2.1. For example, a mild 
degree of gastrointestinal bleeding requiring an overnight hospitalization for monitoring 
purposes may be considered an SAE but is not necessarily severe. 
12.2.2.2. Expectedness  
The Sponsor will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event is ‘expected’ or 
‘unexpected’. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the 
event is not consistent with the risk information provided in the Reference Safety Information of the effective niraparib Investigator Brochure (IB).    
12.2.2.3. Causality 
The Investigator will assess the causality/relationship between the study drug and the AE. One of the following categories should be selected based on medical judgment, considering the definitions and all contributing factors: 
• Definitely related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs in a 
plausible time relationship to treatment administration, and which concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals cannot explain. The response to withdrawal of the treatment should be clinically plausible.  
• Possibly related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the treatment, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
• Unlikely related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
temporal relationship to treatment administration which makes a causal relationship 
improbable, or in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide likely 
explanations. 
Niraparib  
Clinical Study Protocol 3 000-01-003 Amendment 2 
Confidential Page 59 of 71 •Unrelated : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no
temporal relationship with treatment administration. Typically explained by
extraneous factors (e.g . concomitant disease, environmental factors, or other drugs or
chemicals).
12.2.3. Collecting and Recording  Adverse Events  
AEs may be volunteered spontaneously by the study patient, or discovered by the study staff 
during physical examinations or by asking an open, non-leading question such as: “How have 
you been feeling since you were last asked?” The Investigator will document the nature of AE, date of onset of the AE (and time, if known), date of outcome of the AE (and time, if known), 
severity of the AE, actio n taken with study drug as a result of the AE, assessment of the 
seriousness of the AE, and assessment of the causal relationship of the AE to study drug and/or 
study procedure. 
AEs, including laboratory abnormalities that are assessed as clinically signif icant or require 
intervention, should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual 
underlying signs and symptoms. When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be recorded as a separate AE.  
All SAEs will be monitored through 90 days after cessation of study treatment (or to a minimum 
of 30 days post- treatment if the patient starts alternative anticancer therapy)  and recorded in the 
eCRF. SAEs will also be reported on an SAE form as described in section 12.2.5 of this protocol. SAEs considered by the Investigator to be related to study medication are reported until the patient is lost to follow -up or until the patient has died. 
All AEs, regardless of the source of identification ( e.g. physical examination, laboratory 
assessment, reported by patient), must be documented in the eCRF for each patient from the signing of the ICF for this study up to 30 days  after the last dose of study treatment.  
Concomitant illnesses that existed before entry into the study will not be considered an AE unless the illness worsens during the treatment period. Pre-existing conditions will be recorded in the eCRF as well as  on the SAE Report Form medical history section. 
Disease progression is an efficacy criterion and is therefore not considered an AE or SAE (even if fatal). Disease progression should be reported within the eCRF. If AEs/SAEs occur in relation to disease pro gression that are not consistent with the natural progression of the patient’s disease, 
these AEs/SAEs must be reported per AE/SAE reporting requirements described in Section 12.2.5 
12.2.4. Follow-Up of Adverse Events  
All AEs experienced by a patient, regardless of the suspected causality, will be monitored until 
the AE or SAE has resolved, until any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline or 
normal levels, until stabilized with a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed, until the patient is lost to follow -up, or until the patient has died. 
If an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE after the specified follow up period and considers the SAE related to the study drug, the Investigator should report the SAE to the Sponsor 
according to timelines for reporting SAEs described in Section 12.2.5. 
Niraparib  
Clinical Study Protocol 3 000-01-003 Amendment 2 
Confidential Page 60 of 71 12.2.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator must report all SAEs within 24 hours of becoming aware of the initial SAE or 
any follow -up information regarding the SAE using the SAE reporting contact information as 
printed on the SAE forms and in the SAE Completion guidelines. SAEs can be reported after 
study completion, if the SAE is assessed study- drug related.  
For all SAEs, an SAE report form must be completed by the Investigator for all initial and follow-up SAEs. A follow-up SAE report must be completed each time the Investigator becomes 
aware of any additional information regarding the SAE. For the follow-up SAE Report Form, the 
following fields must be completed on each form: follow-up number, site number, patient 
number, protocol number, and the SAE term(s) and date of awareness. Additionally, only the appropriate field(s) on the SAE Report Form where the Investigator received additional or 
updated information should be completed. Previously provided information does not have to be 
entered on the follow-up SAE Report Form. 
Initial and follow -up SAE reports and any additional supporting documentation, as requested 
(e.g. hospital reports, consultant reports, death certificates, autopsy reports) included with the 
SAE report should be sent to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of the Investigator/site awareness or receipt. If supporting documentation is provided, the Investigator should highlight 
all relevant and pertinent information. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to revie w source 
documentation and describe pertinent information on the SAE form. Also, any additional SAE 
documentation must be a clear photocopy with the patient’s personal identifiers removed. The Investigator must sign and date all SAE forms.  
After receipt of  the initial report, the Sponsor (or designee) will review the information and, if 
necessary, contact the Investigator to obtain further information. The Investigator must promptly respond to queries from the Sponsor. 
The minimum information required for a n initial SAE report are the following:  
•Name of person sending the report ( i.e. name, address of the Investigator)
•Investigator signature
•Patient identification (screening/randomization number, initials [if permitted by local
data privacy regulations], NOT patient name)
− Protocol number
•Description of SAE with diagnosis if possible
− Causality assessment
− Seriousness assessment
The Sponsor (or designee) will confirm receipt of all email reports (as long as the email is not 
coming from “no reply” domain) within 1 business day.  
After receipt of the initial report, the Sponsor (or designee) will review the information and, if 
necessary, contact the Investigator to obtain further information. The Investigator should 
promptly respond to queries from the Sponsor.

12.2.6. Submission and Distribution of Serious Adverse Events  
Per regulatory requirements, if an event is assessed by the Sponsor as a Serious Unexpected 
Adverse Reaction (SUSAR), it is the responsibility of the Sponsor to submit the SUSAR Regulatory Authorities according to applicable regulations. 
In addition, the SUSAR will be distributed to the Investigators/sites, utilizing a Council for 
International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) report form, or the MedWatch 3500A form). The Investigator/site will submit a copy of the report to their respective Institutional 
Review Board  (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) per the governing institutional 
requirements and in compliance with local laws and guidelines. 
12.2.7. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) for niraparib are the following: 
 
• Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)  and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)  
• Secondary cancers  (new malignancies [other than MDS or AML])  
• Pneumonitis 
• Embryo-fetal toxicity  
Reporting AESIs:  All occurrences AESIs must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
awareness.  If the AESI is serious, it should be reported on an SAE Report Form [ and designated 
Special Form]. If the AESI is not serious, it should be reported on the relevant designated Special Form. 
AESIs should also be collected and reported as follows: 
• MDS and AML along with other secondary cancers should be reported to the Sponsor until 
death or loss to follow-up.  • Pneumonitis should be reported to the Sponsor through 90 days after the last dose of study drug (or until the start of alternate anticancer thera py, whichever occurs first).  
 • Embryo-fetal toxicity should be reported as outlined in Section 12.2.9. 
12.2.8. Special Situations  
 All occurrences of abuse , misuse, medication error, overdose, and accidental occupational 
exposure with any study treatment  must be reported on a Special Situation Form to the Sponsor 
regardless of whether an AE or SAE has occurred. The form should be submitted as soon as 
possible, and if there is no AE or SAE, it should be indicated that  ‘no AE has occurred’ . If the

awareness.  
12.2.9. Pregnancy Reporting and Follow- up 
The Investigator should complete the Initial Pregnancy Notification report form and forward it to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the pregnancy. If there is an 
associated s erious outcome, then both the Initial Pregnancy Notification report form and SAE 
report form should be completed. 
The site will follow -up with the patient at least monthly and document the patient’s status until 
the pregnancy has been completed or terminated. The Investigator will make every effort to 
obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor. The Pregnancy Outcome report form should be completed and 
submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours after the Investigator becomes aware of the pregnancy 
outcome. If an SAE occurred, then the SAE form must be completed and submitted as well. 
In the event the pregnancy outcome occurs following the end of the study and database lock, the 
Investigator will report the pregnancy outcome to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours after 
the outcome of the pregnancy is known to the Investigator in accordance with the procedure for 
reporting SAEs (Section  12.2.5). 
Pregnancy alone is not regarded as an AE unless there is a possibility that the study drug may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Elective abortions w ithout 
complications should not be considered AEs unless they were therapeutic abortions, but should 
be reported to the Sponsor. Hospitalization for normal delivery of a healthy newborn should not 
be considered an SAE. Pregnancy is not considered an SAE unless there is an associated serious outcome. Spontaneous abortions should always be reported as SAEs. 
Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy must be recorded on the Pregnancy Outcome  Report 
Form (e.g. maternal serious complications, therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, 
neonatal death, congenital anomaly, birth defect) and reported within 24 hours in accordance 
with the procedure for reporting SAEs.

A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be issued as a separate document, providing detailed 
methods for the safety analyses outlined in this section. Any deviations from the planned 
analyses will be described and justified in the final integrated clinical study report (CSR).  
13.1. Determination of Sample Size  
16 PK-evaluable patients will be enr olled in the study (8 with normal hepatic function and 8 with 
moderate hepatic impairment). This is a descriptive study and no formal sample size calculations 
were performed. The proposed sample size is consistent with the recommendations in the FDA 
document (at least 6 subjects), Guidance for Industry for Hepatic Function studies (Guidance for Industry 2003). 
13.2. Study Population  
13.2.1. Patient Disposition  
Study completion status will be summarized for all patients. Categories summarized will include those patients who were screened, enrolled, completed the study, or discontinued early (including reason for discontinuation). 
13.2.2. Demographic Information and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic characteristics of all patients enrolled will be summarized descriptively by gro up 
and will include age, sex, race, height, and weight. 13.2.3. Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations will be listed by patient.  
13.2.4. Analysis Populations 
The pharmacokinetic population for the evaluation of the PK of niraparib and M1 in patients 
with normal hepatic function and in patients with hepatic impairment will consist of all patients who receive niraparib and have sufficient evaluable samples for the determination of C
max, 
AUC0-t, and AUC 0-∞.  
The safety population will consist of all patients who receive dru g. 
13.3. General Considerations  
All data will be summarized by group. Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of patients, mean, standard deviation [StD ev], minimum, median, 
and maximum). Categorical variables will be summarized using counts of patients and percentages.  
Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol 3 000-01-003 Amendment 2 
Confidential  Page 64 of 71 13.4. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Plasma concentrations over time and PK parameters of niraparib will be evaluated after single 
dose administration. Individual and mean plasma concentrations over time will be plotted by 
hepatic function group. 
Individual patient PK parameter values will be derived by non- compartmental methods using 
WinNonlin, version 5.1 or higher . Nominal or actual time will be used in the data analysis. 
Plasma concentrations and PK parameters will be s ummarized in terms of the number of 
patients, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, minimum and 
maximum by group. 
To assess the effects of hepatic impairment on niraparib PK, linear models will be applied to the 
log-transformed C max, and AUC 0-t, AUC 0- ∞. The independent variable in the analyses will be 
liver function (normal hepatic function [control] or moderate hepatic impairment). Point estimates and 90% CIs for differences between means on the log scale will be exponenti ated to 
express the results as ratios of geometric means on the original scale. Patients with normal 
hepatic function (Group 2) will be used as reference group to which Group 1 will be compared. 
No adjustments will be made for multiplicity.  
Box plots of PK parameters (C
max, AUC 0-t, AUC 0-∞, CL/F, and CLfu/F) by hepatic function 
group will be provided.  
Similar analyses will be performed on M1 if appropriate. 
The effect of hepatic dysfunction on unbound concentrations of niraparib and M1 may be 
assessed apply ing a general linear model with a factor for hepatic impairment status.  
13.5. Safety Analyses  
13.5.1. Adverse Events  
All AEs will be listed. The number and percent of patients who experienced an AE will be 
summarized by timing/treatment for each system organ class and p referred term. AEs will also

14.1. Data Quality Assurance  
The Sponsor or its designee will conduct a study initiation visit to verify the qualifications of the 
Investigator, inspect the facilities, and inform the Investigator of responsibilities and procedures for ensuring adequate and correct documentation. 
The Investigator must prepare and maintain adequate and accurate records of all observations and 
other data pertinent to the clinica l study for each study participant. Frequent communication 
between the clinical site and the Sponsor is essential to ensure that the safety of the study is monitored adequately. The Investigator will make all appropriate safety assessments on an ongoing basis. The Sponsor’s Medical Monitor may review safety information as it becomes available 
throughout the study. 
All aspects of the study will be carefully monitored with respect to Good Clinical Practices (GCP) 
and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for compliance with applicable government regulations. 
The Study Monitor will be an authorized individual designated by the Sponsor. The Study Monitor 
will have access to all records necessary to ensure integrity of the data and will periodically review the progress of the study with the Investigator or designee. 
14.2. Access to Source Data/Documents  
An electronic data capture system to manage data collection will be utilized during this trial. The electronic data capture system is a software tool designed to ensure quality assurance and facilitate data capture during clinical trials. The system is fully Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 21 part 11 compliant. 
The Investigator will ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported to the 
Sponsor. Data collection processes and procedures will be reviewed and validated to ensure 
completeness, accuracy, reliability, and consistency. A complete audit trail will be maintained of 
all data changes. The Investigator or designee will cooperate with the Sponsor’s representative(s) for the periodic review of study documents to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data capture system at each scheduled monitoring visit. 
Electronic consistency checks and manual review will be used to identify any errors or 
inconsistencies in the data. This information will be provided to the respective study sites by means 
of electronic or manual queries.  
The Investigator or designee will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate study documents (e.g. medical records, AE rep orting, and concomitant medication reporting, raw data collection 
forms) designed to record all observations and other pertinent data for each patient receiving study treatment.  
The Investigator will allow Sponsor representatives, contract designees, authorized regulatory 
authority inspectors, and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) to have direct access to all 
documents pertaining to the study.

Confidential  Page 67 of 71 14.3. Archiving Study Documents  
Essential clinical documents will be maintained to demonstrate the validity of the study and the 
integrity of the data collected. Master files should be established at the beginning of the study, 
maintained for the duration of the study, and retained according to the appropriate regulations. According to International Council on Harmoniz ation (ICH) guidelines, essential documents 
should be retained for a minimum of 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in 
an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the study treatment.  
14.4. Good Clinical Practice  
This study will be conducted in accordance with ICH GCP and the Declaration of Helsinki (Version 2008). The clinical study will also b e carried out in keeping with national and local 
regulatory requirement(s). 
14.5. Informed Consent  
Before each patient is enrolled in the clinical study, written informed consent will be obtained from the patient according to the regulatory and legal requirements of the participating country. As part of this procedure, the Investigator must explain orally and in writing the nature, duration, and 
purpose of the study, and the action of the study treatment in such a manner that the patient is 
aware of the potential  risks, inconveniences, or AEs that may occur. The patient should be 
informed that he/she is free to withdraw from the study at any time. The patient will receive all 
information that is required by regulatory authorities and ICH guidelines. The Investigat or or 
designee will provide the Sponsor with a copy of the IRB/IEC -approved ICF prior to the start of 
the study. 
The ICF must be signed and dated; 1 copy will be given to the patient and the Investigator will 
retain 1 copy as part of the clinical study rec ords. The Investigator will not undertake any 
investigation specifically required for the clinical study until written consent has been obtained. The terms of the consent and when it was obtained must also be documented. 
If a protocol amendment is required, then the ICF may need to be revised to reflect the changes to 
the protocol. If the ICF is revised, it must be reviewed and approved by the responsible IRB/IEC, 
and signed by all patients subsequently enrolled in the clinical study as well as those currently 
enrolled in the clinical study.  
14.6. Protocol Approval and Amendment  
Before the start of the study, the study protocol and/or other relevant documents will be approved by the responsible IRB/IEC/Competent Authorities, in accordance with local legal requirem ents. 
The Sponsor must ensure that all ethical and legal requirements have been met before the first patient is enrolled in the study.  
This protocol is to be followed exactly. To alter the protocol, amendments must be written, receive 
approval from the appropriate personnel, and receive IRB/IEC/Competent Authority approval 
prior to implementation (if appropriate). In the US: Following approval, the protocol 
amendment(s) will be submitted to the IND under which the study is being conducted. 
Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol 3 000-01-003 Amendment 2

for a formal amendment. All amendments will be distributed to all protocol recipients with 
appropriate instructions. 
14.7. Study Monitoring  
Monitoring and auditing procedures approved by the Sponsor will be followed, in order to comply 
with GCP guidelines. On- site checking of the CRFs for completeness and clarity, cross -checking 
with source documents, and clarification of administrative matters will be performed.  
The study will be monitored by the Sponsor or its designee. Monitoring will be done by personal visits from a representative of the Sponsor (site monitor) who will review the CRFs and source 
documents. The site monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to protocol design and regulatory requirements by frequent site visits and by communications (letter, telephone, and fax). 
All unused study treatment and other study materials will be returned to the Sponsor after the 
clinical phase of the study has been  completed.  
14.8. Audits and Inspections  
Responsible IRB/IEC/Competent Authorities and/or the Sponsor's clinical quality assurance 
group, or its designee, may request access to all source documents, CRFs, and other study 
documentation for on- site audit or inspection. Direct access to these documents must be guaranteed 
by the Investigator, who must provide support at all times for these activities.  
14.9. Ethical Considerations  
The study will be conducted in accordance with ethical principles founded in the Declaration of Helsinki (Version 2008). The IRB/IEC will review all appropriate study documentation in order to safeguard the rights, safety and well -being of the patients. The study will only be conducted at 
sites where IRB/IEC approval has been obtained. The protocol, IB, ICF, advertisements (if 
applicable), written information given to the patients, safety updates, annual progress reports, and any revisions to these documents will be provided to the IRB/IEC by the Investigator.

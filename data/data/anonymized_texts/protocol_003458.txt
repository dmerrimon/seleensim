Study Design
This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study to assess efficacy and safety of:
onab-paclitaxel in combination with epigenetic modifying therapy of CC-486,
onab-paclitaxel in combination with immunotherapy of durvalumab, 
oandnab-paclitaxel monotherapy 
as second/third-line treatment in subjects with  advanced NSCLC who have received no more 
than one prior chemotherapy regimen. Approximately 240 subjects with advanced NSCLC will 
be assigned 1:1:1 into one of the following treatment arms: nab-paclitaxel /CC-486 combination 
therapy, nab-paclitaxel /durvalumab combination therapy or nab-paclitaxel monotherapy prior to 
receiving the first dose of investigational product (IP). Rando mization/tr eatment assignment 
strategy of subjects to the three treatment arms  is described in the Overview of Statist ical 
Methods below and in Section 10.1. 
The study will consist of up to a 28-day Screening Period, a Treatment Period and a Follow-up 
Period.
The Screening Period for eligibility determination begins upon subject written informed consent.  
All screening assessments must be completed within 28 days prior to first dose of IP.
The Treatment Period begins with the first dose of IP as described in Section 8.  Subjects will 
receive one of the following treatments based on the randomization/tr eatment assignment:
!nab-Paclitaxel 100 mg/m
2IV infusion over 30 minutes on Days 8 and 15 and CC-486 
200 mg orally QD on Days 1 to 14 of each 21-day treatment cycle, or  
!nab-Paclitaxel 100 mg/m2IV infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 and 
durvalumab 1125 mg IV infusion ove r approximately 1 hour on Day 15 of each 21-
day treatment cycle, or  
!nab-Paclitaxel 100 mg/m2IV infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-
day treatment cycle
No additional anticancer agents are allowed during study treatment.  All supportive care
(including but not limited to growth factors, antiemetics, analgesics, zoledronic acid, 
denosumab) is permitted as per the Investigato r’s discretion and should be administered 
according to local institutional pract ice. Sub jects will continue treatment un til disease 
progression, development of an unacceptable tox icity, death, lost to follow-up, withdrawal of 
consent, or termination of the study by the Sponsor. Subjects in the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab 
arm may continue treatment beyond disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines, Version 1.1 as described in Section 4.1.2.1 .
Tumor evaluations will be assessed by the investigative sites and response will be determined 
according to RECIST guidelines, Version 1.1 ( Eisenhauer, 2009 ), and immune-related RECIST 
criteria (irRECIST) when applicable.&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21o more  more

Protocol ABI-007-NSCL-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 8 ABI-007-NSCL-006 Amendment 5.0 Final: 09 Dec 2016All scheduled laboratory samples will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis. Local 
hematology and chemistry tests may be perfor med as required for s ubject management/treatment 
decisions. Local laboratory values that are considered abnormal and clinically significant will be 
recorded as an adverse event (AE)/serious adverse event (SAE) and also recorded on the laboratory electronic Case Report  Form (eCRF) (see Section 11.3).
All subjects who discontinue from treatment for an y reason other than withdrawal of consent, 
lost to follow-up, death, or termination of th e study by the sponsor will enter the Follow-up 
Period. It will consist of a visit 28 days after the last dose of IP or End of Treatment Visit, 
whichever is later. Thereafter, subjects in the nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 combination and nab-
paclitaxel monotherapy arms will be follow ed for survival by phone call contact approximately 
every 90 days (+/- 14 days) for at least 12 mont hs after the last sub ject is ra ndomized/assigned in 
either arm or 120 progression-free survival (PFS) events have been observed between these two 
arms, whichever comes later. Subjects  in the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab arm will be followed for 
survival in a similar manner for at least 12 months after the last subject is assigned to this arm.
During the study, subjects will have computed tomography (CT) scans every 42 days (-3/+7 
days) until documented progression of disease
, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, death, 
or termination of the study by the Sponsor. Subjects in the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab arm who 
continue beyond disease progression per RECIST 1.1 will continue to have CT scans every 42 
days (-3/+7) until progression per immune-related RECIST criteria (irRECIST 1.1) ( Nishino, 
2013 ). Those subjects entering the Follow-up Period without documented progression will 
continue to have CT scans in accordance with local standard of care (or approximately every 90 
days) until documented progression of disease , withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, death, 
or termination of the study by the Sponsor. All post-treatment anticancer therapies will be 
recorded during the Follow-up Peri od.  
Study Population
Male and female subjects with advanced NSCLC who have received no more than one prior
chemotherapy regimen for their advanced diseas e will be eligible for this study (immunotherapy 
in prior line of treatment is allowed, including platinum doublet combination). Subjects will receive study therapy as second or third line of treatment for advanced disease.
Length of Study
The enrollment of 240 subjects on this study w ill take approximately 28 months. The total length 
of this Phase 2 study with follow-up for survival is estimated to be approximately 40 months.
The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the 
post-treatment follow-up, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is required for primary, secondary and/or exploratory analysis, as prespecified in the protocol, 
whichever is the later date.
Study Treatments
Subjects will receive nab-paclitaxel in combination with CC-486 or durvalumab, or nab-
paclitaxel monotherapy during the study. The CC-486, nab-paclitaxel, and durvalumab are
designated as IP and w ill be pack aged and supplied by the Study S ponsor. &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21matelymately

Protocol ABI-007-NSCL-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 9 ABI-007-NSCL-006 Amendment 5.0 Final: 09 Dec 2016Overview of Statistical Methods
The primary objective of this study is to  estimate the efficacy of the CC-486 and nab-paclitaxel 
combination therapy, that of the durvalumab and nab-paclitaxel combination therapy, and that of 
the nab-paclitaxel monothe rapy. The secondary efficacy ob jective is to estimate the relative 
efficacy of each of the combination regimens to the monotherapy regimen and the tolerability of 
each of the 3 treatment regimens.  
Approximately 240 subjects will be assigned to one of the three treatment arms (approximately 
80 subjects per group).  A permuted-block randomization method will be employed to assign the 
subjects among the treatment arms that are enrolling simultaneously, stratified by the following 
baseline factors: ECOG performance status (0 versus 1), gender (males versus females), and smoker (yes versus no). Randomization/treatment assignment of subjects will be carried out 
centrally using an Interactive Response Technolo gy (IRT) system. Prior to Protocol Amendment 
4.0, all subjects were randomized 1:1 to the nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 combination therapy and 
nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arms . As Protocol Amendment 4.0 implementation was in effect 
after enrollment in the nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 combination therapy and nab-paclitaxel 
monotherapy arms completed with each reaching approximately 80 subjects, all subjects enrolled while Protocol Amendment 4.0 is in effect and at the time of Protocol Amendment 5.0 
implementation will be assigned to the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab combination therapy arm until 
approximately 80 subjects have been enrolled in that arm. Hence, treatment assignment of 
subjects to the nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 combination therapy and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy 
arms was in effect conducted completely in  a randomized fashion and randomization between
thenab-paclitaxel/durvalumab combination and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arms will not apply.  
Evaluations of the study endpoints will be based primarily on the point estimates and the 
associated 95% confidence intervals of the w ithin- and between -treatment differences (each 
combination therapy vs. monotherapy).
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established to review the interim 
safety and efficacy data.  
Efficacy Analyses
The intent-to-treat population, which includes all rando mized (or assigne d) subjects regardless of 
whether the subject receives any IP or has any e fficacy assessments performed, will be used for 
all eff icacy analyses. The primary efficacy endpoint is PFS, which is defined as the time from the 
date of rando mization/tr eatment assignment to the date of disease progression or death ( from any 
cause) on or prior to the data cutoff date for analyses, whichever occurs first, based on the 
Investigator’s assessment of the data from CT scans using RECIST 1.1 guidelines. Baseline tumor measurements will be determined from the radiologic evaluation performed within 28 
days before the start of study therapy. 
Progression-free survival will be summarized us ing Kaplan-Meier methods with median PFS 
time (including two-sided 95% confidence interval [CI]) for each treatment arm.  The relative 
treatment effect between each of the combination the rapy and monotherapy arms with respect to 
PFS will be estimated by the hazard ratio (HR) a nd the associated two-sided 95% CIs using the 
stratified Cox proportional hazard model with ECOG performance status (0 versus 1), gender
(males versus females), and smoker (yes versus no) as the stratification factors. No statistical 
inferential tests will be performed. To expl ore the effect of treatment post initial progression, the he

Confidential and Propri etary 10 ABI-007-NSCL-006 Amendment 5.0 Final: 09 Dec 2016PFS defined by irRECIST criteria may be estimated for those subjects in the nab-
paclitaxel/durvalumab combination arm.
The secondary endpoints include disease control rate (DCR), overall response rate (ORR), and 
overall survival (OS). Disease control rate and ORR will be summarized within each treatment arm by the observed rates and the associated 95% CIs. The relative treatment effect of each of 
the combination therapy arms to the monotherapy arm will be summarized by the ratio of the 
observed rates. Overall survival w ill be analyzed us ing similar statist ical methods as that for the 
PFS endpoint.
Safety Analyses
The treated population, which incl udes all subjects who receive at least one dose of IP, will be 
the analysis population for all safety analyses. 
Adverse events will be analyzed in terms of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), 
defined as any AE or SAE occurring or worsening on or after the day of the first dose of the IPthrough 28 days after the last dose of the last IP administration.  
In addition, any SAE with an onset date more than 28 days after the last dose of IP that is 
assessed by the Investigator as related to IP w ill be considered a TEAE. For the nab-
paclitaxel/durvalumab arm, AEs with an onset from 29 days up to 90 days after the last dose of 
any IP will be summarized separately.
Treatment-emergent adverse events, Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, SAEs, TEAEs leading to dose 
reduction, and dose interruption, TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation, and TEAEs with 
an outcome of death will be summarized by treatment arms using MedDRA system organ class 
and preferred terms.
Sample Size
This study is designed primarily to estimate the treatment effect within each of the combination 
and monotherapy arms and secondarily the relat ive effect between each of the combination 
therapy and the monotherapy arms with respect to the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. 
The sample size was chosen to support the estimation of the within - and between-treatment 
effects with reasonable precision. Table 1 below summarizes the precisions that can be achieved 
given different scenarios of hypothetical observed hazard ratios between the two treatment arms 
for PFS events, assuming a total of approximately 120 events are observed between two
treatment arms, and the time to PFS has an exponential distribution.

Protocol ABI-007-NSCL-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 11 ABI-007-NSCL-006 Amendment 5.0 Final: 09 Dec 2016Assuming the median times of PFS are 4.17, 4.25 and 2.5 months, respectively, for the nab-
paclitaxel/CC-486 combination therapy, the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab combination therapy and 
nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arms, and an approximate 28 months accrual period for a total of 
approximately 240 subjects, it is estimated that an approximate total of 170 PFS events among the 
three arms will be observed by approximately 3 months after the last subject is assigned to the 
nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab arm, assuming an exponential distribution for PFS. 
One nonbinding interim analysis for PFS with early stopping rule for fut ility will be c onducted 
when approximately 60 events have been observed between the nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 
combination and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arms. An additional non-binding interim analysis 
for futility with early st opping rule with the PFS endpoint between the nab-
paclitaxel/durvalumab combination and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy ar ms will be conducted 
when approximately 30 PFS events have been observed in the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab arm 
(60 or more events are expected to have o ccurred in the monotherapy arm at that point).
At the interim analysis data review on , based on the recommendation of the DMC, 
treatment with CC-486 will be discontinued in the nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 combination arm; 
subjects in this arm may be allowed to continue on nab-paclitaxel single agent, at the 
Investigator’s discretion.  
Similarly, following the outcome of the interim analysis between nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab 
combination and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arms, and taking into account the DMC 
recommendations, subjects may be allowed to remain on either nab-paclitaxel or durvalumab as 
a single agent or both agents, at the Investigator’s discretion.
Data Monitoring Committee
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established with the responsibilities 
for safeguarding the interests of study participants and monitoring the overall conduct of the 
study. Final recommendations of the DMC will reflect the judgment of the DMC members and will be considered advisory in nature to the Sponsor. The decision to implement the 
recommendations of the DMC will be made by the Sponsor, following consultation with the trial

1.1. Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and women worldwide, 
with 1.2 million new cases diagnosed each year. Non-small cell l ung cancer (NSCLC) is the 
most common type of lung cancer, accounting for 80% of all new cases. There are an estimated 
1.1 million lives lost per year (approx imately 500,000 in the United States [US] a nd European 
Union [EU] alone) due to NSCLC. Smoking is the causative factor for up to 85% of cases 
(http://www.lungcancercoalition.org/en/pages/about/awareness).
The majority of patients are not diagnosed  until the tumor has progressed beyond the primary 
site. Despite step-wise advances in patient selection, targeted agents, and optimizing
chemotherapy regimens, patients with advanced NSCLC continue to have an unmet medical 
need ( Schiller, 2013 ).
Platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens remain (eg, platinum-based agents with taxanes) 
the standard first-line treatment in the US and Japan. In the EU, a third-generation 
chemotherapeutic agent (docetaxel, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, or vinorelbine), most commonly gemcitabine or vinorelbine, plus a platinum drug is used for advanced NSCLC ( NICE, 2011 ). 
For first-line therapy in patients with Stage IV NSCLC and good performance status, the 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) clinical practice guideline recommends treatment with a platinum-based two-drug combination of cytotoxic drugs ( Azzoli, 2009 ). For 
patients without disease progression, the option of maintenance monotherapy with pemetrexed or 
erlotinib could also be considered ( Gerber, 2013; Schiller, 2013 ). A trend that is becoming more 
prevalent is personalized NSCLC treatment base d on tumor histology (squamous versus
nonsquamous), on molecular characteristics of the tumor, and on the patient’s clinical status 
using agents targeting specific receptors, kinases and pathways (ie, epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 [EML4] and anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase [ALK] fusion protein).
Single agent chemotherapy (pemetrexed, EGFR-inhibitors and taxanes) are standards of care for 
second-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or m etastatic NSCLC after f ailure of 
prior platinum-based chemotherapy. Docetaxel has be en widely evaluated in this setting, and is 
currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as a single agent for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC after failure of prior chemotherapy  (the US label specifies prior platinum-
based chemotherapy). For patients with  a good performance status at the time of disease 
progression following first-line chemotherapy, docetaxel, despite a low response rate, was
associated with a 10% to  20% prolongation of 1-year survival and an improved quality of life 
when compared with ifosfamide, vinorelb ine, or best supportive care (BSC) alone ( Hanna, 
2004 ). Erlotinib is indicated in the US and EU for the treatment of patients with locally advanced 
or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen, although no 
survival benefit has been demonstrated in patients with EGFR-IHC negative tumors.  Pemetrexed is indicated in the US and EU as a single agent for the treatment of patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC after prior chemotherapy. However, the 
approval and subsequent increased use of pemetrexed  and erlotinib in the first-line setting poses 
an unmet need in the second-line setting, wh ereby new therapeutic options are needed.rimaryrimary

Confidential and Propri etary 20 ABI-007-NSCL-006 Amendment 5.0 Final: 09 Dec 2016Recently, nintedanib, a triple angiokinase inhibitor, was approved in the European Union (EU) in
combination with docetaxel as second-lin e therapy for NSCLC. The results showed that 
compared to docetaxel alone, nintedanib plus docetaxel significantly extended the median OS 
from 10.3 to 12.6 months for patients with a dvanced adenocarcinoma, after first-line 
chemotherapy (p = 0.0359; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.83) ( Reck, 2014a ). In addition, ramucirumab 
was approved in the US in combin ation with docetaxel as second-line therapy. The Phase 3 
REVEL trial compared ramucirumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR)-2 antagonist, plus docetaxel with placebo plus docetaxel in NSCLC patients who experienced 
disease progression after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy for locally advanced or 
metastatic disease. Median OS was better in  the ramucirumab group than in the placebo group 
(10.5 vs 9.1 months; HR, 0.857; p = .0235), as wa s median progression-fr ee survival (PFS) (4.5 
vs 3.0 months; HR, 0.762; p < .0001) ( Garon, 2014 ).
More recently, advances in immunotherapy have seen approvals of nivolumab (US and EU) and 
pembrolizumab (US) in the advanced NSCLC setting after prior chemotherapy. In this setting,
nivolumab has shown benefit in overall su rvival with 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.3 to 13.3) versus 
6.0 months (95% CI, 5.1 to 7.3) with docetaxel in advanced squamous NSCLC (Checkmate 017 study) ( Brahmer, 2015 ), and 12.2 months (95% CI, 9.7 to 15.0) versus 9.4 months (95% CI, 8.1 
to 10.7) with docetaxel (HR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.89; p = 0.002) in nonsquamous disease
(Checkmate 057 study) ( Borghaei, 2015 ). However, PFS benefit was modest (3.5 months with 
nivolumab versus 2.8 months with docetaxel (HR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.81; p <0.001) or did 
not favor nivolumab in these populations. Regar ding its safety profile, nivolumab is most 
commonly associated with immune-related adverse reactions. Most of these including severe 
reactions resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy, or withdrawal of 
nivolumab. In the pooled dataset of two studies in squamous NSCLC, the most frequent adverse 
reactions were fatigue (33%), decreased appetite (15%), and nausea (12%). The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate (Grades 1 or 2) ( Opdivo
®Prescribing Information ). In
comparison, the efficacy of pembrolizumab was investigated in a sub-group of a cohort of 280 
patients enrolled in a multicenter, open-label multi-cohort, activity-estimating study which showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 41% (95% CI, 29 to 54) in both squamous and 
nonsquamous subjects. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients receiving 
pembrolizumab and the most frequent reported in at least 2% of patients were pleural effusion, pneumonia, dyspnea, pulmonary embolism, and pneumonitis ( Keytruda
®Prescribing 
Information ).
Similarly and as will be described below, the PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab has demonstrated 
encouraging clinical activity both as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents 
including standard chemotherapies in metastatic melanoma, NSCLC and other advanced solid 
tumors, with acceptable and manageable reported toxicities.
1.2. nab-Paclitaxel in NSCLC
nab-Paclitaxel is approved in the first-line setting in  combination with carboplatin for patients 
with NSCLC in the US, EU, Japan, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and other countries.  The 
approval was based on the evaluation of Phase I and II data ( Belani, 2008 ; Rizvi, 2008 ; Socinski, 
2010 ), as well as the pivotal Phase 3 study (CA031), ( Socinski, 2012 ). The pivotal Phase 3 study

Protocol ABI-007-NSCL-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 21 ABI-007-NSCL-006 Amendment 5.0 Final: 09 Dec 2016Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC to compare nab-paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin to paclitaxel 
injection in combination with carboplatin as first-line treatment in patients with advanced 
NSCLC. nab-Paclitaxel was administered as an IV infusion ove r 30 minutes at a dose of 
100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle. Paclitaxel injection was administered as 
an IV infusion over 3 hours at a dose of 200 mg/m2, following premedication. In both treatment 
arms carboplatin at a dose of area under the cu rve (AUC) = 6 mg*min/mL was administered IV
on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle after completion of nab-paclitaxel/paclitaxel infusion. Treatment 
was administered until disease progression, development of an unacceptable tox icity or patient 
withdrawal. The primary efficacy outcome  measure was overall response rate (ORR) as
determined by a central independent review  committee using RECIST guidelines (Version 1.0).
In the intent-to-treat (all-ra ndomized) population, the median age was 60 years, 75% were men, 
81% were white, 49% had carcinoma/adenocarcinoma, 43% had squamous cell lung cancer, 76% 
were ECOG performance status (PS) 1, 15% were ≥70 years of age and 73% were current or 
former smokers. Patients received a median of 6 cycles of treatment in both study arms. Patients 
in the nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin arm ha d a statistically significantly higher overall response rate 
compared to patients in the paclitaxel inject ion/carboplatin arm [(33% versus 25%; response rate 
ratio, 1.313; 95% CI, 1.082 to 1.593; p = 0.005), see Table 2 ].
Non-inferiority analysis of overall survival (OS) demonstrated that nab-paclitaxel /carboplatin
(nab-p/C) treatment is not inferior to paclitaxe l/carboplatin (P/C) treatmen t. Overall survival in 
the nab-paclitaxel arm was 12.1 months versus 11.2 months in the control arm (p = 0.271; HR = 
0.922). There was an approximately 10% increase in PFS in the nab-p/C versus P/C arm and PFS 
in the nab-p/C arm was noninferior to PFS in the P/C arm (HR nab-p/C/P/C 95% CI upper bound, 
1.086).

Confidential and Propri etary 22 ABI-007-NSCL-006 Amendment 5.0 Final: 09 Dec 2016were observed at a similar incidence in nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin and paclitaxel/carboplatin
arms: alopecia 56%, nausea 27%, fatigue 25%, decreased appetite 17%, asth enia 16%, 
constipation 16%, diarrhea 15%, vomiting 12%, dyspnea 12%, and rash 10% (incidence rates are 
for the nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin treatment group). Toxiciti es, particularly neuropathy and 
Grade 3/4 neutropenia were less pronounced using nab-paclitaxel in the dose and schedule 
employed. Laboratory-detected abnormalities which occurred with a difference ≥5% for nab-
paclitaxel plus carboplatin versus paclitaxel injection plus carboplatin (Grades 1 to 4 [and Grade 3/4]) were: anemia (98% vs 91% [28% vs 7%]), neutropenia (85% vs 83% [47% vs 58%]) and 
thrombocytopenia (68% vs 55% [18% vs 9%]).  
1.3. Rationale for nab-Paclitaxel as Second/Third-line Treatment in
Subjects with Advanced NSCLC
Patients who fail first-line chemotherapy are elig ible for second-line treatment with single agent 
docetaxel, pemetrexed or erlotinib. In patients with good performance (eg, ECOG PS 0 or 1) and 
general health status, further treatment with chemo therapy is an important consideration that has 
been shown to extend overall survival. Despite the availability of second-line therapy, the trend of increased use of pemetrexed, as well as erlotinib (in selected patients) in the first-line and 
maintenance settings, potenti ally limits  the number of available second-line treatment options for 
many patients. Furthermore, the tolerability i ssues associated with the administration of 
docetaxel once every 3 weeks (q3w) h as prompted active research in the past decade to evaluate 
whether weekly regimens of taxanes could be  optimized to improve the toxicity profile. The 
availability of an effective second-line cytotoxic chemotherapy with an improved efficacy/safetyprofile over current available options would be a valu able addition for both the patient and the 
treating physician. Paclitaxel has also demonstrated potential activity in second-line NSCLC in a 
few studies ( Socinski, 1999 ; Juan, 2002 ; Socinski, 2002 ; Sculier, 2002 ; Buccheri, 2004 ; Ceresoli, 
2004 ; Yasuda, 2004 ). More recently, advances in immunotherapy have seen increased use of 
immune checkpoint inhibitors (eg, nivolumab, pembrolizumab) in the first and/or second-line 
setting for advanced NSCLC disease. 
nab-Paclitaxel exhibits 10-fold higher mean C
maxof free paclitaxel, delivers 33% higher drug 
concentration to tumors in preclinical xenograft models, and demonstrates enhanced transport 
across endothelial cell monolayers, wh en compared with paclitaxel ( Desai, 2006; Gardner, 
2008 ). Distribution of nab-paclitaxel to peripheral tissues as demonstrated in a recent study was 
4-fold faster and 10-fold more extensive than of Cremophor EL-paclitaxel micelles, which 
results in a unique and distinct profile of paclitaxel in tissues ( Li, 2015 ). The Cremophor EL-free 
medium enables nab-paclitaxel to be given over a shorter duration without the need for 
premedication to prevent solvent-related hypersensi tivity reactions, thus also avoiding negative 
impact of steroids on paclitaxel induced apoptosis and decreased antitumoral activity of chemotherapeutic agents as reported in pre-clinical models glucocorticoids ( Abraxane
®
Prescribing Information ;Zavodovskaya, 2015; Herr, 2003; Sui, 2006; Khan, 2013; Pang, 2006).
When administered with carboplatin in the first-line setting, weekly nab-paclitaxel has 
demonstrated a more favorable efficacy:safety profile compared to the every 3 weeks schedule.  
This weekly schedule of nab-paclitaxel allows the opportunity for closer (ie, shorter interval)
monitoring of side effects and optimizing dos e-intensity through timely adjustments.  &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21in

Protocol ABI-007-NSCL-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 23 ABI-007-NSCL-006 Amendment 5.0 Final: 09 Dec 2016Finally, recently published data has demonstrated efficacy of nab-paclitaxel as monotherapy in 
the second line setting in advanced NSCLC with ORR ranging from 16.1% to 33% and a median 
PFS of up to 5 months ( Chen, 2012; Saxena, 2012; Yuan, 2012 ).  
Rationale for dose and schedule
As previously noted, nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2weekly (Days 1, 8 and 15) in combination with 
carboplatin (21 day cycle) is a pproved in the US, EU, Japan, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand 
and other countries for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in the first-line setting.  However, there is limited data of monotherapy nab-paclitaxel in the second or third-line 
setting; hence, this study will assess the efficacy and tolerability of weekly nab-paclitaxel, when 
administered on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle.  The allowance of a one week rest period in this study (ie, no treatment on Day 15), takes into  account research findings from other taxanes, 
whereby patients in the second-line setting are unlikely to tolerate the same dose-intensity 
compared to chemo-naïve patients (eg, sharpe r dose reduction in the second-line setting). 
Therefore, the proposed nab-paclitaxel schedule (2 weeks treatment, 1 week rest) could offer the 
option of maintaining consistent dose-intensity for NSCLC patients in this setting.
1.4. Rationale for nab-Paclitaxel in Combination With Epigenetic 
Modifying Therapy of CC-486 as Second/Third-line Treatment in Subjects with Advanced NSCLC
CC-486 is an orally bioa vailable formulation of the nucleoside analog 5- azacitidine (AZA).  
After its incorporation into a cell’s DNA during the S-phase of the cell cycle, CC- 486 forms 
covalent adducts with DNA Methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and depletes this enzyme required for the maintenance of DNA methylation patterns, thereby altering the epigenetic status of the cell. 
Epigenetic changes are covalent modifications of chromatin (DNA and histone proteins) that 
mediate the stable transmission of a gene’s transcriptional status through cell division.  One of the first recognized epigenetic alterations in cancer was DNA methylation. The addition of a 
methyl group to cytosine in the dinucleotide CpG is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases 
(DNMTs) and is associated with transcriptional repression of genes with high density of CpGs (CpG islands) in the vicinity of their promoters ( Jones, 2007 ).  Genomic methylation patterns are 
precisely regulated during normal embryonic devel opment and differentiation and have been 
found to be altered in specific ways in cancer. Specifically, cancer cell genomes are typified by 
reduced methylation globally with focal areas of aberrant hypermethylation in the CpG islands of 
genes encoding known tumor suppressors such as PTEN and BRCA1 as well as genes encoding 
proteins required for apoptosis, including caspase 8, DAPK and Apaf-1.  DNA methylation-based silencing can thus contribute to the establishment and maintenance of the transformed state 
and limit the effectiveness of anti-cancer therapies .  The recognition of the role of aberrant 
methylation in carcinogenesis and its reversibility has led to the development of DNMT inhibitors for cancer. Subcutaneous (SC) AZA wa s the first DNMT inhibitor to be approved in 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in 2004 ( Kaminskas, 2005 ).
The notion that sequential treatment with an epigenetic modifying agent followed by a cytotoxic
agent can result in improved response to the latter is supported by numerous preclinical 
experiments and now by early clinical results.  In breast cancer cell lines, restoring expression of 
the aberrantly methylated pro-apoptotic gene TMS1 with azacitidine can restore taxane &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21ine ne

Confidential and Propri etary 24 ABI-007-NSCL-006 Amendment 5.0 Final: 09 Dec 2016sensitivity ( Gordian, 2009 ).  In a model of platinum resistant ovarian cancer, azacitidine reversed 
resistance to carboplatin ( Li, 2009 ).  This effect required pretreatment of the cells with 
noncytotoxic levels of azacitidine for 24 hours before the addition of carboplatin and was not 
observed with concurrent exposure to both agents.  More recently, Juergens and colleagues observed an unusually high ORR of approximately 20% in multiple-relapsed NSCLC patients 
treated with a variety of regimens after being treated with a combination of SC AZA and another 
epigenetic agent, entinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor ( Juergens, 2011 ).  In one case, a 
patient who had previously progressed on a regimen of paclitaxel, carboplatin and bevacizumab 
responded to the same triplet after treatment with SC AZA and entinostat, suggesting that the 
epigenetic modifying agents had reversed acquired resistance to the cytotoxic/anti-angiogenic regimen.  In a Phase 1/2 study of SC AZA with nab-paclitaxel in subjects with advanced 
metastatic solid tumors and breast cancer ( Dumlao, 2011 ), escalating doses of SC AZA (75 to
100 mg/m
2) were administered on Days 1 through 5, followed by nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2) 
intravenous (IV) on Days 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle.  Of 16 subjects treated at the time of 
publication, clinical activity has included 3 co mplete responses (CR, 1 Diffuse Large  B-cell 
Lymphoma [DLBCL], 2 ovarian), 4 partial responses (PR) in ovarian and endometrial cancer and 4 stable diseases (SD, 2 lung, 1 pancreatic, and 1 sarcoma).  
CC-486 entered clinical testing in 2006 in subjects with MDS, chronic myelomonocytic 
leukemia [CMML], and acute myeloid leukemia [AML], with daily extended dosing schedules of 14 and 21 out of 28 days in a non-crossover fashion.  Daily doses of 300 mg CC-486 have 
proven to be tolerated on both the 14 and 21 out of 28-day schedules with myelosuppression, 
gastrointestinal symptoms, and fatigue being the most common toxicities ( Garcia-Manero, 
2011 ).  Subjects treated with CC-486 for 14 or 21 days had DNA hypomethylation that persisted 
through the end of cycle.  This contrasts with the lack of persistent hypomethylation at the end of 
cycle when subjects were treated with SC AZA for 7 out of 28 days.

This Phase 2 study will test the hypothesis that epigenetic modifying therapy with CC-486 can 
improve the anti-tumor activity of nab-paclitaxel in second/third-line NSCLC patients (see 
Section 4.2for study rationale). Although docetaxel has been assessed in other randomized 
studies as a chemotherapy backbone, the considerable neutropenia-related toxicity could 
potentially pose safety concerns if combined with CC-486, and the steroid premedication could 
confound the epigenetic impact of CC-486.  In addition, the q3w dosing schedule of docetaxel 
restricts dose adjustment options, thus potentially yielding lower chemotherapy dose-intensity.
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochures (IBs) of CC-486 and nab-paclitaxel (ABI-007) for 
detailed information concerning the available pharmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism, 
clinical studies, and adverse event profile of the IPs.

of Durvalumab as Second/Third-line Treatment in Subjects with Advanced NSCLC
Durvalumab 
Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 kappa 
subclass that inhibits binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 and CD80 and is being developed by AstraZeneca/MedImmune for use in the treatment of cancer.  (MedImmune is a wholly owned 
subsidiary of AstraZeneca; AstraZeneca/MedImmune will be referred to as AstraZeneca 
throughout this document.)  As durvalumab is an engineered mAb, it does not induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or complement-dependent cytotoxicity.  The proposed 
mechanism of action for durvalumab is interferen ce of the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and 
CD80.
To date durvalumab has been given to more than  1900 patients as part of ongoing studies either 
as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-cancer agents.  Refer to the current 
durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure for a complete summary of non-clinical and clinical information including safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics.  
A Phase 2 trial of durvalumab is currently ongoing to assess efficacy and safety of the immune 
checkpoint inhibitor (dose of 10 mg/kg once every two weeks [q2w]) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in the third-line setting ( Rizvi, 2014 ) (ATLANTIC trial, 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
Preliminary data of an open-label Phase 1b study of durvalumab 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks plus 
tremelimumab 1 mg/kg in immunonaive patients wi th advanced or metastatic squamous or non-
squamous NSCLC showed a manageable tolerability profile, with antitumor activity i rrespective 
of PD-L1 status (ORR 22%, 95% CI 9-44) ( Antonia, 2016 ).

nab- Paclitaxel in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors
Tumor lysis as a consequence of chemotherap y treatment leads to release of tumor antigens, 
which in turn are recognized by the immune system, thus priming the immune system for 
checkpoint inhibitor activity ( Bracci, 2014; Chen, 2013; Mellman, 2011 ). Accumulating 
evidence suggests that immune activation plays an important role in chemotherapy efficacy
(Zitvogel, 2013 ). In addition to increasing tumor antigenicity, chemotherapy also reduces tumor 
burden and acts directly on immune cell populations, activating dendritic cells, depleting immunosuppressive regulatory T cells at low doses , depleting myeloid-derived suppressor cells, 
and increasing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( Tanaka, 2009; Banissi, 2009; Kodumudi, 2010; 
Dieci, 2014 ). Taxanes have been shown to facilitate dendritic cell maturation and cytokine 
secretion ( Chen, 2013a ). In patients with lung cancer, paclitaxel was associated with generation
of pro -inflammatory markers, including interleukin 2 and interferon gamma, and the expression 
of T cell activation markers ( Zhang, 2008 ). Taxanes have been demonstrated to modulate the 
immune system by impairing regulatory T cells, which are drivers of peripheral tolerance, but 
not effector T cells, which are drivers of tumor -cell killing ( Tanaka, 2009 ). Taxanes are also 
known to act on myeloid cells such as myeloid -derived suppressor cells and alternatively &(/*(1(352with with iimmmm5 nce of chemce of chem

2010 ).
The data above suggest a potential f or synergistic activity of cytotox ic therapy, such as taxanes, 
with checkpoint inhibitors, including those that target PD -1 or PD -L1.  nab -Paclitaxel has 
demonstrated cytotoxic activity in non -small cell lung cancer (overall response rate = 33% vs 
25% with paclitaxel in a Phase III trial) (Socinsk i, 2012) and, as stated above, does not require 
steroid pretreatment, which may make it a logical choice for combination with immune 
checkpoint inhibitor.
Therefore, this Phase 2 study will furthe r assess the potential synergistic activity of nab-
paclitaxel, a cytotoxic agent, in combination with the anti-PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor 
durvalumab in second/third-line treatment for advanced  NSCLC, from an efficacy and safety 
standpoint.  The current study will allow patients who progress on prior checkpoint inhibitor 
therapy (eg, as their first-line or second-line therapy) as it is hypothesized that the companion 
chemotherapy of nab-paclitaxel may re-sensitize the disease to allow patient to respond to checkpoint inhibitors.
!nab- Paclitaxel in combination with anti-PD-L1
More recently, preliminary results of an ongoing Ph ase 1b trial in first line metastatic NSCLC of
another immune checkpoint anti-PD-L1 inhibitor, atezolizumab, showed high response rates in combination with the following platinum-based doublets: 60 % (95% CI: 15-95) in the 
carboplatin/paclitaxel cohort (Arm C; n = 5), 75% (95% CI: 43-95) in the 
carboplatin/pemetrexed arm (Arm D; n=14), a nd 62 % (95% CI: 32-86) with four patients 
experiencing complete response when atezolizumab was combined with carboplatin/ nab-
paclitaxel regimen (Arm E; n=13) ( Liu, 2015 ). The most frequent AEs included nausea (Arms C 
and D, 50%; Arm E, 73%), fatigue (Arm C, 38%; Arm D, 36%; Arm E, 73%) and constipation (Arm C, 25%; Arm D, 71%; Arm E, 27%). The most common MPDL3280A-related Grades 3 to 
4 AEs included anemia (Arms D and E, 7%), neutropenia (Arm C, 13%; Arm D, 7%) and 
thrombocytopenia (Arms D and E, 7%). No pneumonitis was seen. One MPDL3280A-related Grade 5 AE due to candidemia after prolonged neutropenia was seen in Arm D. Thirty patients
were efficacy evaluable (Arm C, 5; Arm D, 12; Arm E, 13). Over all, tr eatment with 
atezolizumab plus chemotherapy (including mainten ance therapy) was well tolerated, without
apparent exacerbation of chemotherapy-associated adverse events.

!nab- Paclitaxel in combination with anti-PD-1
An ongoing Celgene-sponsored Phase 1 trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in solid tumo rs is assessing the 
safety and efficacy of the anti-PD-1 agent nivolumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel and
carboplatin in a cohort of subjects  with advanced NSCLC patients in the first-line setting ( nab-
paclitaxel 100 mg/m2on Days 1, 8 and 15 and carboplatin AUC 6 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle 
(Cycles 1 to 4 only); nivolumab 5 mg/kg on Day 15 of each 21-day cycle starting in Cycle 1). 
Preliminary results show that amongst the 9 sub jects having received study treatment including 
nivolumab, 6 had partial responses and 3 stab le disease. No dose limiting toxicities were 
observed. Most common AEs were low grade vomiting, diarrhea, alopecia, peripheral 
neuropathy and neutropenia (data on file). These results are consistent with another Phase 1 trial 
comparing anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab (10 mg/ kg IV q3w) combined with three different 
platinum-doublet regimens in 52 patients with chemotherapy-naïve advanced NSCLC, with a
reported ORR of 33% with gemcitabine/cisplatin, 47% with pemetrexed/cisplatin, as well as with 
paclitaxel/carboplatin, while stable disease was reported in 58%, 47%, and 27% of subjects, respectively (Checkmate 012; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]); ( Antonia, 2014 ). Grades 3 to 4 treatment-related 
adverse events were reported in 45% of patients (25% to 73% across arms), including 
pneumonitis (4 patients, 7%; managed by protocol al gorithm), and fatigue and acute renal f ailure 
(3 patients, 5% each).

to 15 mg/kg q4w or once every 90 days (Q90D); metastatic melanoma) ( Wang, 2014 ). A 
population PK mod el indicated minor impact of body WT on the PK of tremelimumab 
(coefficient of ≤ 0.5). The WT-based (1 mg/kg q4w) and fixed dosing (75 mg/kg q4w; based on 
median body WT of ~75 kg) regimens were compared using predicted PK concentrations (5th, 
median and 95th percentiles) using a popul ation PK model in a simulated population of 1000 
patients with body WT distribution of 40 to 120 kg. Similar to durvalumab, simulations indicated 
that both body WT-based and fixed dosing regimens of tremelimumab yield similar median 
steady state PK concentrati ons with slightly less between-subject variability with fixed dosing 
regimen.
Similar findings have been reported by others ( Ng, 2006; Wang, 2009; Zhang, 2012; Narwal,
2013 ). Wang and colleagues investigated 12 monoclonal antibodies and found that fixed and 
body size-based dosing perform similarly, with fixed dosing being better for 7 of 12 antibodies 
(Wang, 2009 ). In addition, they investigated 18 therapeutic proteins and peptides and showed 
that fixed dosing performed better for 12 of 18 in terms of reducing the between-subject 
variability in PK/PD parameters ( Zhang, 2012 ). 
A fixed dosing approach is preferred by the prescribing community due to ease of use and 
reduced dosing errors. Given the expectation of  similar PK exposure and variability, it is 
considered feasible to switch to fixed dosing regimens.
Sequential administration of chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor will allow for limitation of 
potential interactions and better management of toxicities.

4.1. Study Design
This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study to assess safety and efficacy of:
!nab-paclitaxel in combination with epigenetic modifying therapy of CC-486,
!nab-paclitaxel in combination with immunotherapy of durvalumab, 
!andnab-paclitaxel monotherapy 
as second/third-line treatment in subjects with  advanced NSCLC who have received no more 
than one prior chemotherapy regimen. Approximately 240 subjects with advanced NSCLC will be assigned 1:1:1 into one of the following treatment arms: nab-paclitaxel/CC-486, nab-
paclitaxel/durvalumab combination therapy or nab-paclitaxel monotherapy prior to receiving the 
first dose of investigational product (IP). Randomization (details in Section 10.1), when 
conducted, will be centralized and stratified by ECOG performance status (0 versus 1, see 
Appendix A ), gender (males versus females), and smoker (yes versus no).
The study will consist of up to a 28-day Sc reening Period, a Treatment Period and a Follow-up 
Period.  
4.1.1. Screening Period 
The Screening Period for eligibility determination begins upon subject written informed consent.  
All screening assessments must be completed within 28 days prior to first dose of IP.
4.1.2. Treatment Period 
The Treatment Period begins with the firs t dose of IP as described in Section 8.  Subjects will 
receive one of the following treatments based on the randomization/tr eatment assignment:
!nab-Paclitaxel 100 mg/m
2IV infusion over 30 minutes on Days 8 and 15 and CC-486 
200 mg orally QD on Days 1 to 14 of each 21-day treatment cycle, or  
!nab-Paclitaxel 100 mg/m2IV infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 and 
durvalumab 1125 mg IV infusion over approximately 1 hour on Day 15 of each 21-
day treatment cycle, or  
!nab-Paclitaxel 100 mg/m2IV infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-
day treatment cycle.
No additional anticancer agents are allowed during study treatment.  All supportive care
(including but not limited to growth factors, antiemetics, analgesics, zoledronic acid, denosumab) is permitted as per the Investigato r’s discretion and should be administered 
according to local institutional pract ice. Sub jects will continue treatment until disease 
progression, development of an unacceptable toxicity, death, lost to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or termination of the study by the Sponsor.
During the study, subjects will have computed tomography (CT) scans every 42 days (-3/+7 
days) until documented progression of disease
, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, death, 
or termination of the study by the Sponsor. Tumor evaluations will be assessed by the &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21more ore

immune-related RECIST criteria (irRECIST) when applicable. All scheduled laboratory samples 
will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis. Local hematology and chemistry tests may be 
performed as required for sub ject management/treatment decisions. Local laboratory values that 
are considered abnormal and c linically significant will be recorded as an AE/SAE and also 
recorded on the laboratory eCRF (see Section 11.3).
4.1.2.1. Treatment Beyond Progression for Subjects in the nab-Paclitaxel/Durvalumab 
Arm
Subjects in the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab arm may be permitted to continue treatment beyond 
initial RECIST 1.1 defined progressive disease as long as they meet the following criteria:
!Continue to meet all other study protocol eligibility criteria
!Investigator assessed clinical benefit and absence of rapid disease progression or 
clinical deterioration
!Stable performance status
!Tolerance to IP
!Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent
serious complications of disease progression (eg, brain metastases)
Subjects will be re-consented with an informed  consent document describing any reasonably 
foreseeable risks or discomforts and other alternative treatment options.
Response assessment should continue every 42 days (-3/+7 days) as per Table of Events
(Table 4 ). The assessment of clinical benefit should be balanced by clinical judgment as to 
whether the subject is clinically deteriorating and unlikely to receive any benefit from continued treatment with nab-paclitaxel/ durvalumab. If the Investigator feels that the subject continues to 
achieve clinical benefit by continuing treatment and the subject consents, the subject may remain 
on the trial and will continue to receive moni toring according to the schedule in the Table of 
Events. The decision to continue treatment should be discussed with the Sponsor’s Medical 
Monitor and documented in the study source documents.
Study therapy should be disc ontinued if further progression is documented by irRECIST. 
4.1.3. End-of-Treatment Visit
The End-of-Treatment Visit is defined as the vi sit when decision for treatment discontinuation is 
made. 
4.1.4. Follow-up Period
All subjects who discontinue from treatment for reas ons other than withdrawal of consent, lost to 
follow-up, death, or termination of the study by the Sponsor w ill enter the Follow-up Period. It 
will consist of a visit 28 days after last dose of IP or  End-of-Treatment Visit, whichever is later,
followed by phone follow-up for survival approximately  every 90 days (+/- 14 days) for at least
12 months after the last subject is randomized or 120 PFS events have been observed, whichever 
comes later, between the nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 co mbination and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21eyyonoyyyd d

after the last dose of IP, and will be followed for survival in a similar manner for at least 12 
months after the last subject is assigned to this arm. Those subjects entering the Follow-up 
Period without documented progression will continue to have CT scans in accordance with local standard of care (or approximately every 90 days) until documented progression of disease
, 
withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, d eath, or termination of the study by the Sponsor. All 
post-treatment anticancer therapies will be recorded during th e Follow-up Period.  
4.2. Study Design Rationale
This is an open-label study designed to es timate the effects of addi ng CC-486 or durvalumab to 
nab-paclitaxel and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy in second/third-line NSCLC. A placebo-
controlled study would not be feasible for this population as blinding would be difficult and would need a double dummy design.  
A key objective in this study is to determine the chemo-pr iming effect of CC-486  and to estimate 
the effect of the combination of nab-paclitaxel with PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor. Second/third-
line NSCLC enables a unique setting to evaluate epigenetics: 
a) It is currently unknown whether patients in second or later lines of treatment have 
optimal immune function/reserve which is cr itical for sa fety and activation of immune 
cells that target cancer cells,
b) Due to the overlapping (and dose-limiti ng) toxicities of doublet/tr iplet chemotherapy 
regimens in the first-line setting, it would be very challenging to combine epigenetic therapy at a dose level to elicit clinically meaningful benefit.
Although docetaxel has been assessed in other randomized studies as a chemotherapy backbone
as shown in Table 3 , the considerable neutropenia-related toxicity could potentially pose safety 
concerns if combined with CC-486, and the steroid premedication could confound the epigenetic 
impact of CC-486.  In addition, the q3w dosing schedu le of docetaxel restricts dose adjustment 
options, thus potentially yielding lower chem otherapy dose-intensity. As mentioned above, nab-
paclitaxel has shown benefit for both squamous and nonsquamous histologies. Furthermore, 
recent data with immune checkpoint inhibitors (eg, nivolumab) have shown greater efficacy in 
subjects with squamous histology versus nonsqua mous histology with manageable toxicities. 
Hence it will be important in the current study to assess the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel 
either as monotherapy or in combination tr eatment in subjects with squamous and nonsquamous 
NSCLC histologies.
For patients with NSCLC whose disease progressed after initial chemotherapy, the goal of 
therapy is to delay further progression for as long as possible; hence, the use of PFS as the 
primary endpoint for efficacy evaluation.

Furthermore, maintaining quality of life during this period, especially in reducing/managing

Recruitment is expected to take approximately 28 months, and the final analysis of PFS between 
the nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 combination and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arms  will be performed 
when approximately 120 PFS events have occurred, estimated as approximately 25 months from 
first subject randomized. The final analysis for the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab arm will be 
conducted when approximately 50 events have occurred in this arm. The total length of this 
Phase 2 study with follow-up is estimated to last approximately 40 months.
4.4. End of Trial
The End of Trial is defined as either the:
!date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the post-treatment follow-up, or 
!date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is required for primary, 
secondary and/or exploratory analysis, as prespecified in the protocol, whichever is 
the later date.

Visit for all subjects, and at the Follow-up Visits for subjects in the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab arm.
cAll subjects must have a radiographically documented measurable tu mor(s) by RECIST 1.1 criteria: Complete chest CT scan (including base of neck and adrenal gland) will be 
performed at Screening, every 42 days (-3/+7 days) (starting from  Cycle 1 Day 1) until disease progression, withdrawal of consent,  lost to follow-up, d eath, or termination of the 
study by the Sponsor. The results  of a complete chest CT scan (including base of neck and adrenal gland) performed per standard of care may be accepted and not repeated 
during Screening provided it was performed within 28 days of the first dose of IP (Cycle 1 Day 1). The methods of assessment chose n at baseline to follow tumors are to remain 
consistent throughout study duration. Those subjects entering the Follow-up Period without documented progression will continue to have CT scans in accordance with local 
standard of care (or approximately every 90 days) until documented progression of disease, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow -up, d eath, or termination of the study by the 
Sponsor.  If the CT scan was performed within 2 weeks of the En d-of-Treatment Visit, this End-of-Treatment Visit CT scan will no t need to be repeated. Subjects in the nab-
paclitaxel/durvalumab arm who continue beyond disease progression per RECIST 1.1 will continue to have CT scans every 42 days ( -3/+7) until progression per immune-related 
RECIST criteria (irRECIST) version 1.1 (Nishino, 2013).
dHeight will only be obtained at Screening Visit. Weight will be obtained at Screening and every visit during the Treatment Peri od before administration of IP.
eThe occurrence of peripheral neuropathy will be reported by the Investigator per protocol as an AE or SAE.
fAll scheduled laboratory samples will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis. Local hematology and chemistry tests may be  performed as required for subject 
management/treatment decisions. Local laboratory values that are considered abnormal and clinically significant will be recorde d as an AE/SAE and also recorded on the 
laboratory eCRF (see Section 11.3).

Subjects will be provided with a written Informed Consent Form (ICF), given the opportunity to 
ask any questions concerning the study and will sign an ICF prior to participating in any study 
procedures. After giving written informed consent, subjects will undergo a Screening Period to 
be assessed for eligibility. All subjects who sign an ICF must be entered into the Integrated Response Technology (IRT) immediately upon signature on the document. Subjects who do not 
meet the eligibility criteria will be considered sc reening failures and will not be eligible for the 
study. Subjects who fail initial screening may undergo re-screening up to 2 times at any time 
and an ICF will need to be resigned, as well as all screening procedures repeated (some 
procedures may not need to be done if previously done within 28 days prior to screening again).
Subjects that have met all eligibility cr iteria after the Screening Period w ill be eligible for
randomization /tr eatment assignment. 
6.1. Medical History
A complete medical history including, but not limited to, evaluation for past (up to 5 years) or
present cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, neurological, endocrine,lymphatic, hematological, immunologic, dermatol ogical, psychiatric, gen itourinary, obstetrical, 
surgical history or any other diseases or disorde rs will be performed at Screening. All NSCLC-
related medical history s hould be recorded regardless of time. Smoking status/tobacco exposure 
history will be captured on the eCRF.
6.2. Prior and Concomitant Medications and Procedures
Prior medications are defined as any me dications started before randomization/treatment
assignment. All NSCLC-related prior medications/procedures shoul d be recorded regardless of 
time.
Concomitant medications are defined as any medication that was either initiated before 
randomization/tr eatment assignment and continued during the study treatment, or initiated 
on/after the date of randomization/treatment assignment and within 28 days after the last dose of 
IP for the monotherapy arm and the nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 combination arms, or 90 days after 
last dose of IP in the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab combination arm. 
All subjects will have concomitant medications and procedures (including radiation therapy) 
recorded at each visit from the time of signature on the ICF until the 28-day Follow-up Visit for 
the monotherapy arm and the nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 combination arms or 90 days after last dose 
of IP in the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab combination arm, for conditions that are clinically 
significant or ongoing. During the Follow-up Period only NSCLC-associated concomitant 
medications/procedures (including radiation thera py) will be recorded, ie, subsequent-line(s) of 
anti-cancer therapy. Additionally, for laboratory procedures performed per standard of care 
during follow-up, laboratory values that are cons idered abnormal and clinically significant will 
be recorded as an AE/SAE and also recorded on the laboratory eCRF.&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21e

All males and all women of child-bearing potential must be reminded to avoid pregnancy prior to 
administration of IP before beginning each new cy cle, at the End-of-Treatment Visit and at the 
Follow-up Visits. A pregnancy test is require d for women of child-bearing potential only. For 
women of child-bearing potential a serum β-hCG pregnancy test with sensitivity of at least 25
mIU/mL must be performed to assess eligibility at Screening/Baseline. Note: the screening 
serum pregnancy test can be used as the Cycle 1 Day 1 test prior to study therapy if it is 
performed within the 72-hour timeframe.  A urine pregnancy test must be performed prior to administration of IP before beginning each new cy cle and at the End-of-Treatment Visit for all 
subjects, and at the Follow-up Visits for subjects in the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab arm. The 
subject may not receive treatment until the Investigator has verified that the result of the pregnancy test is negative. See inclusion cr iteria for pregnancy testing requirements. Any 
pregnancies that occur in women who have r eceived IP must be immediately reported to Celgene 
Drug Safety (See Section 11.4).
6.4. Complete Chest Computed Tomography (CT) Scan
A complete chest CT scan (including base of neck and adrenal gland) and any other studies 
required for tumor imaging will be done at Screening, every 42 days (-3/+7 days) (starting from 
Day 1 Cycle 1), and End-of-Treatment, until documented progression of disease , withdrawal of 
consent, lost to follow-up, death, or terminatio n of the study by the Sponsor. The results of a 
complete chest CT scan (including base of neck and adrenal gland) performed per standard of 
care may be accepted and not repeated during Screening provided it was performed within 28 days of the first dose of IP (Cycle 1 Day 1). Those subjects entering the Follow-up Period 
without documented progression will continue to have CT scans in accordance with local 
standard of care (or approximately every 90 days) until documented progression of disease
, 
withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, death,  or termination of the study by the Sponsor. If the 
CT scan was performed within 2 weeks of End-of-Treatment Visit, this End-of-Treatment CT 
scan will not need to be repeated. Additional CT scans may be done at any time during the study if clinically indicated. All CT scans and reports should be archived at the site according to site 
regulations and copies provided to the Sponsor if requested. All post-treatment anticancer 
therapies will be recorded during the Follow-up Period.  
6.5. Weight and Height
Weight will be obtained at Screening and at every visit during the Treatment Period before administration of IP. Additional measurements of we ight may be collected per local standards at 
any time during the study as needed. Height will only be collected at Screening. All weight and 
height data will be collected on eCRFs.
6.6. ECOG Performance Score
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group perfor mance status score will be collected at Screening, 
Day 1 of every treatment cycle, at the End-of-Treatment Visit and at the Follow-up Visits. 
Additional ECOG assessments may be performed at any time during the study as clinically 
indicated.&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21allall

Peripheral neuropathy (sensory or motor) assessmen t will be done at Screening, Day 1 of every 
treatment cycle, at the End-of-Treatment Visit and at the 28-day Follow-up Visit. Changes in 
neuropathy grade from baseline will be reported as an AE as per Section 11. Additional 
peripheral neuropathy assessments may be done at any time during the study as clinically 
indicated.
6.8. Adverse Event Reporting
Adverse events will be recorded from time of signature on the ICF until 28 days after the last 
dose of IP for the monotherapy and the nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 combination arms and until 90 
days after the last dose of IP for the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab combination arm during the 
Follow-up Visits, including any unscheduled visits. See Section 11for details. 
6.9. Quality of Life Questionnaires
The LCSS, EORTC QLQ C30 and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires will be used to measure quality of 
life (QoL) for subjects in the study. The LCSS is comprised of 9 questions to be completed by

All scheduled laboratory samples will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis. Local 
hematology and chemistry tests may be perfor med as required for su bject management/treatment 
decisions. Local laboratory values that are considered abnormal and clinically significant will be 
recorded as an AE/SAE and also recorded on the laboratory eCRF (see Section 11.3).
Abnormal and clinically significant laboratory a ssessments at Screening will be recorded as 
medical history, and after Screening, as AE  or SAE (clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities at Screening may result in a s ubject being ineligible for the study and should not 
be captured as an AE). 
Any abnormal values that persist should be follo wed at the discretion of the Investigator. The 
Investigator should file all copies of the reports, including faxes with the subject’s medical chart.
6.12. Tumor Tissue Sample Collection and Peripheral Blood Collection
(Exploratory Assessments) 
Histologically or cytologically confirmed advan ced NSCLC is a required inclusion criteria for 
entry into this study.  If a subject’s previously collected tumor tissue (also known as archival 
tumor) is av ailable, these samples will be collected for biomarker testing as detailed below at 
Cycle 1 Day 1.  If such samples do not exist, have been depleted, or do not contain sufficient tumor material to be an alyzed, this will not preclude participation in the study and a new biopsy 
or other procedure to collect tumor tissue will not be required. Table 5 delineates the specific 
requirements for commonly encountered archival tumor types.

provided to each subject at the start of each treatment cycle. All tablets should be swallowed 
whole, and should not be broken or chewed. CC-486 may be taken on an empty stomach or with 
food. Subjects should drink 8 ounces (240 mL) of room temperature water with each dose. It is strongly recommended that all subjects receive a dose of a prophylactic antiemetic, preferably a 
5-HT3 antagonist, approximately 30 minutes prior to each dose of CC-486.
The IP must be stored as directed on package label at controlled temperature and a temperature 
log must be maintained in the source documents. The storage area should be secure and have 
access limited to study personnel. 
8.1.3. Durvalumab (MEDI4736)
Durvalumab will be supplied by the Sponsor in single use vials in single count cartons. Each 10R 
(10 mL) vial will be supplied as a liquid solution containing 500 mg (nominal) of IP at a concentration of 50 mg/mL. Durvalumab should be stored in accordance with the product label. 
The study site is to supply the following:
!IV infusion bags of normal saline (0.9% [w /v] sodium chloride injection, 250 mL 
size). Saline bags must be latex-free and can be made of polypropylene, polyethylene, polyolefin copolymers, or polyvinyl chloride. Infusion lines should contain a 0.2- μm 
in-line filter.  &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21rtons. Eachrtons. Eac

Protocol ABI-007-NSCL-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 55 ABI-007-NSCL-006 Amendment 5.0 Final: 09 Dec 2016!Since the compatib ility of durv alumab with other IV medications and solutions, other 
than normal saline, is not known, the durvalumab solution should not be infused through an IV line in which other solutions or medications are being administered.
Durvalumab will be administered using an IV bag containing 0.9% (w/v) saline or 5% (w/v) 
dextrose, with a final durvalumab concentration ranging from 1 to 20 mg/mL, and delivered through an IV administration set with a 0.2- or 0.22- μm in-line filter.
The dose of durvalumab for administration must be prepared by the Investigator’s or site’s 
designated IP manager using aseptic technique. Total time from needle puncture of the MEDI4736 vial to the start of administration should not exceed:
!24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F)
!4 hours at room temperature
Standard infusion time is 1 hour. However, if there are interruptions during infusion, the total 
allowed time should not exceed 8 hours at room temperature. In the event that either preparation 
time or infusion time exceeds the time limits outlin ed above, a new dose must be prepared from 
new vials. Durvalumab does not contain preservatives, and any unused portion must be discarded.
For additional information on preparation and st orage please refer to the pharmacy manual.
8.1.4. Monitoring During/After Durvalumab Infusion 
First durvalumab  infusion
On the first infusion day, subjects in the nab-paclitaxel/ durvalumab combination arm will be 
monitored, and assessments collected/recorded in the eCRF prior to, during and after infusion of IP as presented in the bulleted list below.
Blood pressure (BP) and pulse will be collected from subjects before, during, and after each 
infusion at the following times (b ased on a 60-minute infusion):
!Prior to the beginning of the infusion (measured once from approximately 30 minutes 
before up to 0 minutes [ie, the beginning of the infusion])
!Approximately 30 minutes during the i nfusion (halfway through infusion) 
!At the end of the infusion (approximately 60 minutes ±5 minutes)
!If the infusion takes longer than 60 minutes, then BP and pulse measurements should 
follow the principles as described above or be taken more frequently if clinically indicated.  A 1-hour observation period is recommended after the first infusion of 
durvalumab.
Subsequent durvalumab infusions
BP, pulse and other vital signs should be meas ured, collected/recorded in eCRF prior to the start 
of the infusion. Subjects should be carefully monitored and BP and other vital signs should be 
measured during and post infusion as per institution standard and as clinically indicated. Any clinically significant changes in vital signs should be entered onto an unscheduled vital signs 
CRF page.&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21fusiofusi n, the n, the

In the event of a ≤ Grade 2 infusion-related reaction, the infusion rate of IP may be decreased by 
50% or interrupted until resolution of the event (up to 4 hours) and re-initiated at 50% of the 
initial rate until completion of the infusion. For subjects with a ≤ Grade 2 i nfusion-related 
reaction, subsequent infusions may be administered at 50% of the initial rate. 
Acetaminophen/paracetamol and/or an antihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine) or equivalent 
medications per institutional standard may be admin istered at the discretion of the investigator. If 
the infusion-related reaction is ≥ Grade 3 or higher in severity, IP will be discontinued. 
As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dos e administration are possible. Appropriate drugs 
and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available, andstudy personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis. The study site must have 
immediate access to emergency resuscitation teams and equipment in addition to the ability to 
admit subjects to an intensive care unit if necessary.
8.2. Treatment Administration and Schedule
Following administration of nab-paclitaxel, the intravenous line should be flushed with sodium
chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure administration of the complete dose, 
according to local practice.
Once randomized (or assigned), subjects will be treated with nab-paclitaxel / CC-486, nab-
paclitaxel / durvalumab or nab-paclitaxel monotherapy until disease progression, development of 
an unacceptable toxicity, death, lo st to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or termination of the 
study by the Sponsor:
!nab-Paclitaxel 100 mg/m2IV infusion over 30 minutes on Days 8 and 15 and CC-486 
200 mg orally QD on Days 1 to 14 of each 21-day treatment cycle, or
!nab-Paclitaxel 100 mg/m2IV infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 and 
durvalumab 1125 mg IV infusion over approximately 1 hour on Day 15 of each 21-

Following the first dose of IP, subsequent administration of durvalumab can be modified based 
on toxicities observed as described in the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management 
Guidelines.  These guidelines have been prepared by the Sponsor to assist the Investigator in the 
exercise of his/her clinical judgment in treating these types of toxicities.  These guidelines apply 
to AEs considered causally related to the durvalumab containing regimen by the reporting 
Investigator.
Treatment modifications referring to ‘study regimen or treatment’ would apply to both nab-
paclitaxel and durvalumab unless AEs are not considered causally related to nab-paclitaxel by 
the reporting Investigator. In that case nab-paclitaxel or durvalu mab treatment may be continued 
alone if deemed beneficial to the patient per Investigator’s assessment.

The Treatment Period of the study is open-label. Randomization/treatment assignment has been 
and will be carried out centrally using an IRT system.
8.5. Packaging and Labeling
The label(s) for all IP will include Sponsor name, address and telephone number, the protocol number, IP name, dosage form and strength (where applicable), amount of IP per container, lot number, expiry date (where applicable), medication identification/kit number, dosing 
instructions, storage conditions, and required caution statements and/or re gulatory statements as 
applicable. Additional information may be included on the label as applicable per local regulations.
8.6. Investigational Product Accountability and Disposal
The Sponsor (or its designee) will review with the Investigator and relevant site personnel the 
process for IP return, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilities for the site versus the 
responsibilities of the Sponsor (or designee).
The Sponsor w ill instruct th e Investigator on the ret urn, disposal and/or destruction of IP. Only 
completely unused IP vials should be retained by the site until a representative from the Sponsor
or other Sponsor-designated personnel have completed an inventory. Partially used and
completely used vials should be destroyed accordi ng to local guidelines, and disposition should 
be recorded on the Investigational Drug Accountability Record Form.
The Investigator(s) or designee(s) is responsible for accounting for all IP that is issued to and
returned by the subject during the course of the study according to applicable regulatory
requirements. Any unused CC-486 must be returned by a study subject and retained by the
investigative site for accountability to be conducted  by a Sponsor representative (or its designee). 
If any IP is lost or damaged, its disposition should be documented. At the periodic monitoring
visits, a Sponsor representative (or its designee)  will conduct IP accoun tability and address any
discrepancies. Upon satisfactory reconciliation of all IP, ret urned IP may be destroyed. At the
conclusion of the study, all remaining IP will be  counted, reconciled with dispensing records, 
documented, and destroyed at the clinic site or allocated drug destruction location after
completion of drug accountability by a Sponsor representative (or its designee). The Sponsor
representative (or its designee) will ensure that  a final report of drug accountability to the unit 
dose level (ie, tablet) is prepared and placed in both the Investigator study file and the central 
clinical study file.
Investigational product will not be loaned or dispensed by the Investigator to another 
Investigator or site. Under certain circumstances , and with Sponsor permission, cooperative 
groups may manage IP between locations within their network as clinical trial agreement and 
local guidelines permit.&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21ot

All IP will be administered only by study site personnel and accurate recording of all IP 
administration will be made in the appropriate section of the subject’s eCRF and source 
documents.
8.8. Overdose
Overdose, as defined for this protocol, refers to nab-paclitaxel, CC-486, or durvalumab dosing.
On a per dose basis, an overdose is defined as 10% over the protocol-specified dose of nab-
paclitaxel, durvalumab or CC-486 to a given subject, regardless of any associated adverse events 
or sequelae. 
On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as anything more frequent than the 
protocol required schedule or frequency.
On an infusion rate basis, an overdose is defined as any rate faster than the protocol-specified 
rate. For nab-paclitaxel, an infusion completed in less than 25 minutes may increase C maxby 
approximately 20%, therefore a nab-paclitaxel infusion completed in less than 25 minutes will 
meet the infusion rate criterion for an overdose.
Complete data about drug administration, including any overdose, regardless of whether the 
overdose was accidental or intentional, should be reported in the AE case report form. See 
Section 11.1 for the reporting of adverse events associated with overdose.

9.1. Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures
Over the course of this study, additional medications may be required to manage aspects of the 
disease state of the subjects, including side effects from study treatments or disease recurrence. 
All supportive care (including but not limited to growth factors, antiemetics, analgesics, 
zoledronic acid, denosumab) is permitted as per t he Investigator’s disc retion and should be 
administered according to local institutional practice. All concomitant treatments, including 
blood and blood products, must be reported on the eCRF.
!Antiemetics are not required during the study; however, it is strongly recommended 
that all subjects receive a dose of a prophylactic antiemetic, preferably a 5-HT3 
antagonist, approximately 30 minutes prior to each dose of CC-486.
!Stable, therapeutic doses of anticoagulants are permitted; however, subjects on 
warfarin should have prothrombin t ime (PT) or international norm alized ratio (INR)
and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) monitored as clinically indicated.
!Subjects on eryth ropoietin or darbepo etin alfa for at least 4 weeks prior to starting the 
IP may continue their pretreatment doses throughout the study.
#Note: If the subject is not on a stable dose of an erythropoiesis-stimulating agents 
(ESA) prior to study entry, the subject may not start an ESA during Cycle 1. However, medications such as ESAs, granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-
CSFs), etc., may be administered according to standard of care after Cycle 1.
!Use of white blood cell growth f actors (eg, filgrastim, G-CSF for the treatment of 
subjects with neutropenic fever is permitted at the Investigator ’s discretion. Use of 
filgrastim rather than pegylated-filgrastim is indicated, because of the 14 day delay of 
the next cycle following treatm ent with peg-filgrastim.
!Use of white blood cell growth factors (e g, filgrastim, G-CSF) for secondary
prophylaxis in subjects who experienced  a neutropenic complication from a prior
cycle of chemoth erapy (for which primary prophylaxis was not received) is permitted.
!Flu vaccination with inactivated virus is permitted.
!Routine infectious disease prophylaxis is not recommended, however, antibiotic,
antiviral, antipneumocystis, antifungal, or other prophylaxis may be implementedduring the study at the discretion of the Investigator.
!Treatments with bisphosphonates (eg, p amidronate, zoledronate), or other agents (eg, 
denosumab) to prevent or delay progression of bone metastases are permitted.
Maintenance of a stable dosing regimen throughout the study is recommended.

and intranasal corticosteroids is permitted.
!Treatment with antidiarrheal medications is recommended at the first sign of diarrhea
as per the guidelines in Appendix B . Pre-medication with an tidiarrheal medication for 
subsequent doses of CC-486 may be appropriate.
!The potential drug-drug interactions precautions contained in the nab-paclitaxel 
prescribing information will be applied to this study, unless otherwise specified in the 
protocol. Specifically, the metabolism of paclitaxel is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. Caution is recommended when administering nab-
paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to inhibit (eg, ketoconazole and other 
imidazole antifungals, erythromycin, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, cimetidine, ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir) or induce (eg, rifampicin, carbamazepine, 
phenytoin, efavirenz, nevirapine) either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4. For information 
regarding other drugs that may interact with either nab-paclitaxel or durvalumab and 
affect their metabolism, pharmacokinetics, or excretion, please see the respective IP 
product information (refer to Prescribing Information and/or IB).
!Antiepileptic treatment is permitted, in the context of prophylaxis for seizures, for 
subjects with prior evidence of brain metastasis (asymptomatic and clinically stable for at least 8 weeks following complet ion of therapy for brain metastasis).
9.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medications and Procedures
Other investigational therapies must not be used while the subject is enrolled in the study.
Anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, biologic or i nvestigational therapy, and surgery) other than
the study treatments must not be given to sub jects during the study. If such treatment is required,
the subject must be discontinued from the study . Focal palliative radiotherapy for treatment of
cancer-related symptoms is allowed during study treatment at the discretion of the Investigator.
The administration of either α-interferon and/or ribavirin, or drugs with known renal toxicity is
prohibited during study tr eatment. Monoclon al antibodies against CTLA-4, PD-1 or PD-L1 
should not be given concomitantly.
Immunosuppressive medications including, but not limited to, systemic corticosteroids at doses 
exceeding 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent, methotrexate, azathioprine, and tumor 
necrosis factor- α blockers should not be given during the study unless required for management 
of immune-related toxicities ( Appendix C ).
Live attenuated vaccines should not be given through 30 days after the last dose of IP.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) EGFR TKIs should 
not be given concomitantly with durvalumab, and should be used with caution in the 90 days 
post last dose of durvalumab. Increased incidences of pneumonitis (with third generation EGFR 
TKIs) and increased incidence of transaminase incr eases (with first generation EGFR TKIs) has 
been reported when durvalumab has been given concomitantly.t ll(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21e e

Confidential and Propri etary 66 ABI-007-NSCL-006 Amendment 5.0 Final: 09 Dec 20169.3. Required Concomitant Medications and Procedures for Subjects 
Receiving CC-486
Data regarding G-CSF administration should be  recorded on the e CRF provided for G-CSF 
administration.
9.3.1. Description of G-CSF
This medication stimulates the blood system (bone marrow) to make white blood cells, helping
fight infections. This medication is given to those whose ability to make white blood cells has
been reduced. Filgrastim (also known as G-CSF, or granulocyte colony stimulating factor) is a
man-made version of a certain natural substance found in the body. It is produced using a certain
bacteria. It will be obtained commercially and relabeled as clinical supplies. It should be stored,
and administered according to the manufacturer ’s recommendation.
9.3.2. Administration of G-CSF
For subjects who experience Grade ≥3 neutropenia, G-CSF 5 ∀g/kg daily will be administered
subcutaneously. During any cycle when Grade ≥3 neutropenia occurs, CC-486 and other 
cytotoxic agents will be held, and G-CSF will begin immediately (a minimum of 24 hours after the last dose of CC-486 and chemotherapy). In subsequent cycles, G-CSF will begin on Day 16. 
G-CSF will continue daily until the ANC ≥2000/mm
3. In subjects receiving G-CSF, the next 
cycle should begin no sooner than 48 hours after discontinuation of G-CSF. 
For complete details on drug administration, storage , clinical pharmacology, and the human PK 
of G-CSF (filgrastim), please see the G-CSF (filgrastim) package insert.

Confidential and Propri etary 67 ABI-007-NSCL-006 Amendment 5.0 Final: 09 Dec 201610. STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Statistical analyses for the primary and key s econdary endpoints of the study are described 
below.  Additional analyses of these endpoin ts as well as exploratory endpoints or subgroup 
analyses will be described in detail in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  The SAP supersedes 
the analyses described in the protocol should there be differences between the two.
Evaluations of the study endpoints will be based primarily on the point estimates and the 
associated 95% confidence intervals of the within- and between-treatment differences. 
10.1. Overview
Approximately 240 subjects will be assigned 1:1:1 to one of the three treatment arms 
(approximately 80 subjects per group). The combination arms will receive nab-paclitaxel with 
epigenetic modifying therapy of CC-486 or nab-paclitaxel with immunotherapy of durvalumab,
and the monotherapy arm will receive nab-paclitaxel alone.  All regimens will be administered 
in 21-day cycles. All subjects will receive the assigned study treatment until disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, death, lost to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or termination of the 
study by the Sponsor, in accordance with lo cal standard of care. Treatment beyond progression 
defined by RECIST 1.1 will be permitted per irRECIST criteria for those subjects in the nab-
paclitaxel/durvalumab arm (see Section 4.1.2.1 ).
Prior to Protocol Amendment 4.0, all subjects were randomized 1:1 to the nab-paclitaxel/CC-
486 combination therapy and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arms using a permuted-block 
randomization met hod with the following baseline stratification factors: 
!ECOG performance status (0 versus 1)
!Gender (males versus females)
!Smoker (yes versus no)
Randomization was carried out centrally using an  IRT system. As Protocol Amendment 4.0 
implementation was in effect after enrollment completed in the nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 
combination therapy and nab-paclitaxel monothera py arms (with each arm reaching a total of 
approximately 80 subjects), all subjects enrolled wh ile Protocol Amendment 4.0 is in effect and 
at the time of Protocol Amendment 5.0 implementation will be assigned to the nab-
paclitaxel/durvalumab combination therapy arm until approximately 80 subjects have been enrolled in that arm. Hence, treatment assignment of subjects to the nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 
combination therapy and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arms was in effect conducted completely 
in a randomized fashion and randomization between the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab combination 
and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arms will not apply.
A data monitoring committee (DMC) will be used to review the safety a nd efficacy data during 
the study.&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21

10.2.1. Intent-to-treat Population
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which 
includes all randomized (assigned) subjects regardle ss of whether the subject receives any IP or 
has any efficacy assessments performed. 
10.2.2. Per-protocol (PP) Population
The PP population is defined as all eligible subjects randomized/assigned who receive at least 
one dose of the IP, have been treated in the arm they were assigned and meet the major eligibility
criteria of the protocol.  Additional analyses utilizing the PP population will be described in the 
SAP.
10.2.3. Treated Population
The treated population will consist of all randomized/assigned subjects who receive at least one 
dose of IP. The safety analyses will be based on the treatment as received if different from the 
assigned treatment by rando mization/tr eatment assignment.
10.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations
The primary objective of this study is to estimate the efficacy of the nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 
combination therapy, that of the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab combination therapy, and that of the 
nab-paclitaxel monotherapy.
A secondary efficacy objective is to estimate th e relative efficacy of each of the combination 
regimens to the nab-paclitaxel monotherapy regimen. 
The effect of the treatment regimens with respect to  the efficacy endpoints will be based on the 
point estimates and the associated 95% confidence intervals. The sample size was chosen to support the estimation of the within- treatmen t effects with reasonable precision. In the 
durvalumab arm, a sample size of 80 subjects will further allow the estimation of the treatment 
effect with reasonable precision when stratification by prior checkpoint inhibitor exposure (checkpoint naïve and prior exposure to checkpoint inhibitors) is performed. 
No inferential statistical tests will be performed and no multip licity adjustments are planned for 
the statistical analyses.
Table 7 below summarizes the two-sided 95% confidence intervals for a range of hypothetical 
observed disease control rates given a sample size of 80 subjects in a treatment arm. If the 
observed disease control rate is 0.30, then the actual width of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval is 0.21 (95% CI is [0.20, 0.41]).

The between-treatment effect with respect to PFS can be estimated based on the point estimate of

precision that can be achieved given different scenarios of hypothetical observed hazard ratios 
between the treatment arms for PFS events, assuming a total of 120 events are observed.

a Assuming a standard error of 0 .18 [es timated based on (4/120)1/2] for the log hazard ratio.
Assuming the median times of PFS are 4.17 and 2.5 months, respectively, for the nab-
paclitaxel/CC-486 combination therapy and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arms, and an 
approximate 23 months accrual period for a total of 160 subjects, it is estimated that a total of 
120 PFS events will have been observed approx imately 2 months after the last subject is 
randomized to these 2 arms, assuming an e xponential distribution for PFS. The final analysis of 
the nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 combination and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arms  will be performed 
when a total of approximately 120 PFS events have been observed between these two arms.
While there is published data demonstrating efficacy of nab-paclitaxel as monotherapy in a 
second line setting in advanced NSCLC with ORR ranging from 16.1 to 33% and a median PFS 
of up to 5 months, it is difficult to place an assumed treatment effect on nab-paclitaxel as a 
monotherapy ( Chen, 2012; Saxena, 2012; Yuan, 2012 ).  The assumption of 2.5 months PFS in 
the monotherapy arm is in line with this d ata and other efficacy data previously observed 0.600.5,(7$5<,1)250$7,21777$7$7$7$76))0$$$

Confidential and Propri etary 70 ABI-007-NSCL-006 Amendment 5.0 Final: 09 Dec 2016following monotherapy treatment of advanced disease with other agents ( Shepherd, 2000; 
Hanna, 2004; Reck, 2014; Garon, 2014 ).
[Of note, with 120 PFS events, this study has an 80% power (1-sided, Type-1 error of 2.5%) to 
detect a HR of 0.60 for PFS between two treatment arms.]
Assuming the median time of PFS is 4.25 months for the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab 
combination therapy, and an approximate 13 months accrual period for a total of approximately
80 subjects, it is estimated that a total of approximate 50 PFS events will have been observed at approximately 3 months after the last subject is assigned to this arm, assuming an exponential
distribution for PFS. The final analysis for PFS for the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab arm will be 
performed when approximately 50 PFS events have been observed in this arm.
One nonbinding interim analysis for PFS with an early st opping rule for futility between the nab-
paclitaxel/CC-486 combination and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arms will be conducted when 
approximately 60 events have been observed. The nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 combination arm may 
be stopped early for fu tility if the observed HR is > 1.10, and/or if recommended by the DMC 
based on the safety profile of this combination regimen. A HR> 1.10 when half of the target 
events of 120 have occurred signals a low probability for observing a meaningful difference in favor of the nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 combination therapy s hould the study cont inue to the end. 
With the assumptions stated above, it will take approximately 15 months from the first subject 
randomized to observe approximately 60 PFS events for the interim analysis.
An additional interim analysis for fut ility with the PFS endpoint between the nab-
paclitaxel/durvalumab combination therapy and nab-paclitaxel monothe rapy arms will be 
conducted when approximately 30 PFS events have been observed in the nab-paclitaxel/
durvalumab combination arm. It is projected that 60 or more PFS events will have been observed 
in the nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arm at that point. The nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab combination 
arm may be stopped early for fut ility if the observed HR is ≥ 1.10, and/or if recommended by the 
DMC based on the safety profile of this combination regimen. With the assumptions stated 
above, it will take approximately 13 months from the first subject randomized to the nab-
paclitaxel/durvalumab arm to observe the events needed for this interim analysis. As the enrollment in the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab combination arm started after the enrollment in the 
nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arms ended, randomization between the 
nab-paclitaxel monotherapy and nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab arms does not apply.  Nevertheless, 
the futility boundary for the interim analysis between the two arms will st ill be ut ilized as a 
guidance to the DMC for their recommendations.
At the interim analysis data review on , based on the recommendation of the DMC, 
treatment with CC-486 was discontinued in the nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 combination arm; 
subjects in this arm may be allowed to continue on nab-paclitaxel single agent, at the 
Investigator’s discretion.  
Similarly, following the outcome of the interim analysis between nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab 
combination and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arms, and taking into account the DMC 
recommendations, subjects may be allowed to remain on either nab-paclitaxel or durvalumab as 
a single agent or both agents, at the Investigator’s discretion.
Disease control rate, OS, and ORR within and the difference between the 
nab-paclitaxel/CC-486

tumor measurements will be determined from the radiologic evaluation performed within 28 days before the start of study therapy. 
Subjects who do not have disease progression and are alive as of the data cutoff date for the 
statist ical analysis w ill be censored at the date of the last ra diologic assessment prior to the data 
cutoff date.  Similarly, subjects who discontinue from the study prior to disease progression or 
death will be censored at the date of the last radiologic assessment prior to the data cutoff date.  
In the event that a new anticancer treatment occurs prior to documented progression, the subject will be censored at the date of the last radiologic assessment where the subject was documented 
to be progression-free prior to the new anticancer treatment. Subjects with a single missing 
radiologic assessment prior to a visit with documented disease progression (or death) will be analyzed as a PFS event at the date of the radiologic assessment that shows progression or death 
(whichever is earlier). Subjects with two or more missing radiologic assessments prior to a visit 
with documented disease progression (or death) will be censored at the date of the last radiologic assessment where the subject was documented to be progression-free prior to the first of the two 
missing visits.  Subjects who are alive and drop out  early without any post baseline radiologic 
tumor assessment will be censored on the date of rando mization/tr eatment assignment. 
Progression-free survival will be summarized us ing Kaplan-Meier methods with median PFS 
time (including two-sided 95% CI) for each treatment arm. The Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS will 
be presented graphically for each treatment ar m. The relative treatment effect between the 
combination and monotherapy arms on PFS will be estimated by the hazard ratio (HR) and the 
associated two-sided 95% CIs using the stratified Cox proportional hazard model with ECOG 
performance status (0 versus 1), gender (males versus females), and smoker (yes versus no) as the stratification factors, given the number of events in each cell is adequate. No statist ical 
inferential tests will be performed.
To assess the impact on PFS of radiologic assessments not occurring at the regularly scheduled 
assessment times, the frequency of these unscheduled/off-scheduled assessments will be 
presented for each treatment arm. In addition, confirmatory and sensitivity analyses may be &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21the time frthe time

of PFS, where death or new treatment will be considered as an event, will be conducted to 
address the impact of next line therapy. 
To explore the effect of treatment post initial progression, PFS defined by irRECIST criteria may
be estimated for the subjects in the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab arm.  
10.6.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
10.6.2.1. Disease Control Rate
Disease control rate is defined as the per cent of subjects who have a radiologic complete 
response, partial response, or stable diseas e according to RECIST 1.1 guidelines, as determined 
by the Investigator.
Disease control rate for each treatment arm will be  summarized by the observed DCR rate and 
the associated two-sided 95% CI. The relativ e treatment effect will be summarized by the 
absolute difference and ratio of the res ponse rates and the associated two-sided 95% CI.
10.6.2.2. Overall Survival
Overall survival is defined as the time betw een randomizatio n/treatment assignment and death. 
All deaths, regardless of the cause of death, will be included. All subjects who are lost to follow-
up prior to the end of the study or who are with drawn from the study will be censored at the time 
of last contact. Subjects who are still receiving treatment as of the data cutoff date will be censored at the cutoff date. Overall survival will be analyzed in a similar manner as that for PFS.
10.6.2.3. Overall Response Rate 
Overall response rate is defined as the percen t of subjects who have a radiologic complete or 
partial response according to RECIST 1.1 guidelines determined by the Investigator.  
Overall response rate will be assessed using the same statist ical methods as those for the DCR 
endpoint.
10.6.3. Exploratory Endpoints
10.6.3.1. HealthCare Utilization 
Healthcare utilization will be summarized by treatment. Additional analyses w ill be described in

10.6.3.2. Quality of Life Questionnaires
The score or VAS value and the corresponding change from baseline at each timepoint will be 
summarized by treatment for the EQ-5D-5L, EORTC QLQ C30 and LCSS questionnaires. 
Additional analyses will be described in detail in the SAP.

An exploratory analysis of PFS and DCR using investigator’s assessments based according to 
irRECIST criteria, and their association with PD-L1 expression will be performed for subjects in 
the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab arm.  
10.7. Safety Analysis
The treated population, which includes all subjects who receive at least one dose of IP, will be 
the analysis population for all safety analyses.
The safety/tolerability of the treatment arms will be monitored through continuous reporting and 
evaluated by adverse events and serious adverse events, and incidence of subjects experiencing 
dose modifications, dose interruptions, and/or premature discontinuation of IP.
10.7.1. Adverse Events
TEAEs will be defined as any AE or SAE occurring or worsening on or after the day of the first 
dose of the IP through 28 days after the last dose of IP for the monotherapy arm and the nab-
paclitaxel/CC-486 combination arms, or 90 days after last dose of IP in the nab-
paclitaxel/durvalumab combination arm.  In addition, any serious AE with an onset date more 
than 28 days after the last dose of IP that is assessed by the Investigator as related to IP w ill be 
considered a TEAE. TEAEs occurring up to 28 days after the last dose of IP will be summarized. 
In addition, for the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab arm, AEs with an onset from 29 days up to 90 
days after the last dose of IP will be summarized separately.
Adverse events will be coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). The severity of AEs will be graded based on NCI CTCAE, Version 4.0; 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40.
Treatment-emergent adverse events, Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, serious AEs, TEAEs leading to 
dose reduction, and dose interruption, TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation, and TEAEs 
with an outcome of death will be summarized per treatment arms by MedDRA system organ class and preferred terms. 
Adverse events of special interest relevant to the nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 combination, nab-
paclitaxel/durvalumab combination, and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy regimens observed in 
previous studies in a similar population may be identified and summarized by worst NCI 
CTCAE grade, and MedDRA preferred terms.
By-subject listings will be provided for all relevant safety data. Graphical displays and figures 
will be provided where useful to assist in the interpretation of results.
10.7.2. Laboratory Assessments
Treatment group differences in each laboratory parameter with respect to the NCI CTCAE 
grades will be summarized by the frequency distribution of subjects with the AE grades.  
All laboratory parameters will be summarized by de scriptive statistics within each treatment arm, 
as appropriate. &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21ing and ng and

Confidential and Propri etary 75 ABI-007-NSCL-006 Amendment 5.0 Final: 09 Dec 201610.7.3. IP Exposure
The extent of exposure to the IPs will be asse ssed based on the descriptive statistics on the 
number of cycles and IP doses administered, cumulative dose, average dose intensity, and 
percentage of protocol dose administered.  The incidences of CC-486, nab-paclitaxel, and 
durvalumab dose reductions (although not expected for durvalumab) and dose interruptions will 
be summarized by treatment arm.  
10.8. Study Therapy Termination
Reasons for stopping study therapy will be prese nted in listings and summarized by frequency of 
occurrence and corresponding percentage of occurrence.
10.9. Deaths
Deaths reported during treatment (defined as deaths from the first administration of the IP
through 28 days post last dose of the IP w ill be su mmarized by frequency of occurrence and 
corresponding percentage by cause of death per period (during treatment or follow-up). In 
addition, deaths that occur from 29 to 90 days post last dose will be summarized in a similar manner for the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab combination therapy arm.
10.10. Interim Analysis
One nonbinding interim analysis for PFS with an early st opping rule for futility will be 
conducted when approximately 60 events have been observed between the nab-paclitaxel/CC-
486 combination and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arms. The nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 combination 
arm may be stopped early for fut ility if the observed HR is ≥1.10 given the assumed number of 
PFS events above, and/or if recommended by the DMC based on the safety profile of this combination regimen.   
An additional interim analysis for fut ility with the PFS endpoint between the nab-
paclitaxel/durvalumab combination therapy and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arms will be 
conducted when approximately 30 PFS have been observed in the nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab 
combination arm. This is similar to approximately half of the number of events that are planned 
for the interim analysis between the nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 combination and nab-paclitaxel 
monotherapy arms mentioned above. At this time point, it is projected that approximately ≥ 60 
PFS events will have been observed in the nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arm. The nab-
paclitaxel/durvalumab combination therapy arm may be stopped early for fut ility if the observed 
HR is ≥ 1.10, and/or if recommended by the DMC based on the safety profile of this 
combination regimen. Should th is occur, enrollment in the study may discontinue. The fut ility 
boundary for the interim analysis between the two arms is provided as a guidance to the DMC for their recommendations.
At the interim analysis data review on , based on the recommendation of the DMC, 
treatment with CC-486 was discontinued in the nab-paclitaxel/CC-486 combination arm; 
subjects in this arm may be allowed to continue on nab-paclitaxel single agent, at the 
Investigator’s discretion.  
Similarly, following the outcome of the interim analysis between nab-paclitaxel/durvalumab 
combination and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy arms, and taking into account the DMC &(AtAt&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21ncy oncy o f f

10.11. Data Monitoring Committee
An independent DMC will be established with the responsibilities for safeguarding the interests of study subjects and monitoring the overall conduct of the study. Final reco mmendations of the 
DMC will reflect the judgment of the DMC members and will be considered advisory in nature 
to the Sponsor. The decision to implement the recommendations of the DMC will be made by
the Sponsor, following consultation with the coordinating Investigator and Steering Co mmit tee.
Operational details for the DMC will be detailed in the DMC charter.

Confidential and Propri etary 77 ABI-007-NSCL-006 Amendment 5.0 Final: 09 Dec 201611. ADVERSE EVENTS
11.1. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may 
appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a 
worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject’s health, 
including laboratory test values (as specified by the criteria in Section 11.3), regardless of 
etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or 
intensity of a pre-existing condition) should be  considered an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome 
should be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome. 
For the purposes of this study, progressive disease (PD) of NSCLC will not require reporting as 
an adverse event. However, signs and symptoms (events) related to disease progression may be reported as adverse events. If reported, events of disease progression for NSCLC (including 
deaths due to disease progression for indications that are considered to be fatal) will be assessed 
as expected adverse events and will not be reported as expedited safety reports to regulatory authorities.
Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to an investigational product should be reported as an 
AE. Overdose, accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be reported as an AE. (See Section 8.8for the definition of overdose.) Any sequela of an accidental 
or intentional overdose of an investigational product should be reported as an AE on the AE 
CRF. If the sequela of an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported on an SAE report form and on the AE CRF. The overdose resulting in the SAE should be identified as the 
cause of the event on the SAE report form and CRF but should not be reported as an SAE itself.
In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive 
supportive measures as necessary. There is no known specific antidote for nab-paclitaxel,
CC-486 or durvalumab overdose. Actual treatment should depend on the severity of the clinical 
situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician.
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study. Assessments may include monitoring of 
any or all of the following parameters: the subject’s  clinical symptoms, laboratory, pathological, 
radiological or surgical findings, physical examination findings, or findings from other appropriate tests and procedures.
All AEs will be recorded by the Investigator from the time the subject signs informed consent to
28 days after the last dose of IP for the monothera py and CC-486 combination arms or to 90 days 
for the durvalumab combination arm, and thos e SAEs made known to the Investigator at any 
time thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP. AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) 
will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF and in the subject’s source documents. All SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the 
event by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved 
equivalent form.

Protocol ABI-007-NSCL-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 78 ABI-007-NSCL-006 Amendment 5.0 Final: 09 Dec 201611.2.1. Seriousness 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose that:
!Results in death;
!Is life-threatening (ie, in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE);
!Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of ex isting hospitalization 
(hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay);
!Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions);
!Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;
!Constitutes an important medical event.
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life 
threatening or result in death, hospitalization, or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or 
require medical or surgical intervention to pre vent one of the other outcomes listed above.
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizations for:
!A standard procedure for protocol therapy administration. However, hospita lization 
or prolonged hospitalization for a complication of therapy administration will be 
reported as an SAE. 
!Routine treatment or monitoring of the studi ed indication not associated with any 
deterioration in condition.
!The administration of blood or platelet transfusion as routine treatment of studied 
indication. However, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.
!A procedure for protocol/disease-related investigations (eg, surgery, scans, 
endoscopy, sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling). However, 
hospitalization or prolonged hosp italization for a complication of such procedures 
remains a reportable SAE.
!Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization for technical, practical, or social 
reasons, in absence of an AE.
!A procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to starting of treatment on study); must 
be documented in the source document and the eCRF. Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication remains a reportable SAE.
!An elective treatment of or an elective pr ocedure for a pre-existing condition 
unrelated to the studied indication. 
!Emergency outpatient tr eatment or observation that does not result in admission, 
unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21n of the n of the

Protocol ABI-007-NSCL-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 79 ABI-007-NSCL-006 Amendment 5.0 Final: 09 Dec 2016If an AE is considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the eCRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.
For each SAE, the Investigator will provide information on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to IP, action taken regarding IP, and outcome.
11.2.2. Severity / Intensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator must assess the severity/intensity of the event. The severity/intensity of AEs will be graded based upon the subject’s symptoms according to the 
current active minor version of NCI CTCAE, Version 4.0
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40.
Adverse events that are not defined in the NCI CTCAE should be evaluated for severity/intensity 
according to the following scale:
!Grade 1 = Mild – transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required
!Grade 2 = Moderate – mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required
!Grade 3 = Severe – marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; 
medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization is possible
!Grade 4 = Life threatening – extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance 
required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization or hospice care probable
!Grade 5 = Death – the event results in death
The term “severe” is often used to describe th e intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache). This criterion is notthe same as “serious” which is based 
on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s 
life or functioning.
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a gui de for defining regulatory obligations.
11.2.3. Causality 
The Investigator must determine the relationship between the administration of IP and the 
occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: Means a causal relationship of the adverse event to IP
administration is unlikely or remote , or other medications, 
therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a 
sufficient explanation for the observed event.
Suspected: Means there is a reasonable possibility that the administration 
of IP caused the adverse event.  ‘Reasonable possibility’ means &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21o the o the

Confidential and Propri etary 80 ABI-007-NSCL-006 Amendment 5.0 Final: 09 Dec 2016there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP
and the adverse event.
Causality s hould be a ssessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available 
information.  Causality is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes available.
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or additional IP
that has not been manufactured or provided by the Sponsor, please provide the name of the 
manufacturer when reporting the event.
11.2.4. Duration
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event.
11.2.5. Action Taken
The Investigator will report the action taken with IP as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable 
(eg, discontinuation or reduction of IP, as  appropriate) and report if concomitant and/or 
additional treatments were  given for the event. 
11.2.6. Outcome
The Investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs. All SAEs that have 
not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study must be followed until recovered, recovered with sequelae, not recovered or death (due to the SAE). 
11.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality:
!results in discontinuation from the study;
!requires treatment, modification/ interruption of IP dose, or any other therapeutic 
intervention; or
!is judged to be of significant clinical importance by the Investigator.
Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event.
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF. If the abnormality was not 
a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the labor atory abnormality should b e recorded as the AE.
If possible, the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply as an 
abnormal laboratory result (eg, record throm bocytopenia rather than decreased platelets).
11.4. Pregnancy
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in either a female subject or partner of a 
male subject are immediately reportable events.&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21dadates of thtes of tha

Protocol ABI-007-NSCL-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 81 ABI-007-NSCL-006 Amendment 5.0 Final: 09 Dec 201611.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or 
disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on IP, or within 3 months of the 
subject’s last dose of IP, are considered immediately reportable events. IP is to be discontinued immediately. The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported 
to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the 
Pregnancy Initial Report Form, or approved equiv alent form. The female subject should be 
referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist or another appropriate healthcare professional for further 
evaluation.
The Investigator will follow th e female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or 
abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow -up Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the Investigator
should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious 
criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety by facsimile, or other appropriate 
method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s know ledge of the event using the SAE Report 
Form, or approved equivalent form.
All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causality, as SAEs. In addition, any infant death  after 28 days that the Investigator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safety by 
facsimile, or other appropri ate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the 
event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
11.4.2. Male Subjects
If a female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant while the subject is receiving IP or within 
6 months of the last dose of IP, the male subject  taking IP should notify the Investigator, and the 
pregnant female partner should be advised to call her healthcare provider immediately. If the 
male subject is receiving IP, the IP may need to be discontinued in the male subject, but may be resumed later at the discretion of the Investigator and medical monitor.
11.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE page/scr een of the eCRF. All SAEs must be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by facsimile, 
or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form. This 
instruction pertains to initial SAE report s as well as any follow-up reports.
The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms are accurate and consistent.
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) that occur during the study 
(from the time the subject signs informed consent to at least 28 days after the last dose of IP for 
the monotherapy and CC-486 combination arms or 90 days after the last dose of IP for the 
durvalumab combination arm) and those made known to the Investigator at any time thereafter 
that are suspected of being related to IP. SAEs occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be captured.&(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21er er

of hospital records and other relevant documents. If a subject died and an autopsy has been 
performed, copies of the autopsy report and d eath certificate are to be sent to Celgene Drug 
Safety as soon as these become available. Any fo llow-up data will be detailed in a subsequent 
SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form, and sent to Celgene Drug Safety.
Where required by local legislation, the Investigator is responsible for informing the Independent 
Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) of the SA E and providing them with all relevant 
initial and follow-up information about the event. The Investigator must keep copies of all SAE 
information on file including correspondence with the Sponsor and the IRB/EC.
11.5.1. Safety Queries
Queries pertaining to SAEs w ill be commun icated from Celgene Drug Safety to the site via 
facsimile or electronic mail. The response t ime is exp ected to be no more than five (5) business 
days. Urgent queries (eg, missing causalit y assessment) may be handled by phone.
11.6. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events
For the purpose of regulatory reporting, Celgene Drug Safety will determine the expectedness of 
events suspected of being related to nab-paclitaxel, CC-486 or durvalumab based on the
Investigator Brochures of the respective IPs.
In the US, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be reported in an 
expedited manner in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32.
For countries within the European Economic Area (EEA), the Sponsor or its authorized 
representative will report in an expedited manner to Regulatory Authorities and Ethics 
Committees concerned, suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC and the Detailed Guidance on collection, verification and 
presentation of adverse reaction reports arising from clinical trials on investigational products for 
human use (ENTR/CT3) and also in accordance with country-specific requirements.
The Sponsor or its authorized representative shall notify the Investigator of the following
information: 
!Any AE suspected of being related to the use of IP in this study or in other studies
that is both serious and unexpected (ie, SUSAR);
!Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for 
human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.
Where required by local legislation, the Investigator shall notify his/her IRB/EC promptly of 
these new serious and unexpected AE(s) or significant risks to subjects.
The Investigator must keep copies of all pe rtinent safety information on file including 
correspondence with the Sponsor and the IRB/EC. (See Section 15.3 for record retention 
information).

An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is one of scientific and medical interest specific to 
the understanding of the IP and may require clos e monitoring and rapid communication by the 
Investigator to the Sponsor. An AESI may be serious or nonserious. The rapid reporting of 
AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand them in association with the use of this IP. Furthe r information on risks (eg, presenting symptoms) can
be found in the current version of the Investigator Brochure, including guidelines for their 
evaluation and treatment.

12.1. Study Treatment Discontinuation
The following events are considered sufficient reasons for discontinuing a subject from the IP:
!Adverse Event(s)
!Disease progression
!Withdrawal of consent
!Death
!Lost to follow-up
!Protocol violation
The reason for discontinuation should be recorded in the eCRF and in the source documents.The decision to discontinue a subject remains the responsibility of the treating physician, which
will not be delayed or refused by the Sponsor. However, prior to discontinuing a subject, the
Investigator may contact the Medical Monitor and forward appropriate supporting documents for 
review and discussion.
All subjects discontinued from IP for any reason will have a treatment discontinuation visit at the 
time of discontinuation and should undergo treatment discontinuation procedures.
All subjects discontinue d from IP will be followed for a period of 28 days after last dose of IP
for the monotherapy and CC-486 combination arms  or 90 days after the last dose of IP for the 
durvalumab combination arm for the collection of AEs.
Additionally subjects who withdraw from or discontinue treatment should be followed for 
progressive disease (if applicable), survival and any new anticancer therapy given.
12.2. Study Discontinuation
The following events are considered sufficient reasons for discontinuing a subject from the 
study:
!Withdrawal of consent
!Death
!Lost to follow-up
The following events may be considered sufficient reasons for discontinuing a subject from the 
study:
!Adverse events(s)
!Protocol violation
The reason for st udy discontinuation s hould be recorded in the eCRF and in the source 
documents. The Investigator must notify the Medical Monitor immediately when a subject has been discontinued/withdrawn due to an AE (any unacceptable toxicity). All subjects who are &(/*(1(35235,(7$5<,1)250$7,21urce documurce docu

termination at the time of withdrawal.
Since follow-up of subjects who discontinue prema turely is of particular importance, every 
attempt should be made to collect all survival i nformation and NSCLC treatment/therapy, unless 
the subject has specifically withdrawn consent from further follow-up. The Investigator must 
make every effort to obtain minimal information regarding the subject’s survival status before 
determining that the subject is lost to follow-up.

documentation of this study are designed to ensure that the Sponsor, its authorized 
representative, and Investigator abide by Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as described in 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guideline E6 and in accordance with the general ethical principles outlined in the Declarati on of Helsinki. The study will receive approval 
from an IRB/EC prior to commencement. The I nvestigator will conduct all aspects of this study 
in accordance with applicable national, state, and local laws of the pertinent regulatory authorities.
14.2. Investigator Responsibilities
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and in the local regulations. The Sponsor staff or its authorized representative will evaluate and approve 
all Investigators who in t urn will select their staff.
The Investigator should ensure that all persons assi sting with the study are adequately informed 
about the protocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study-related duties and functions. 
The Investigator should maintain a list of sub-Investigators and other appropriately qualified 
persons to whom he or she has d elegated significant study-related duties.
The Investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all subjects who sign an ICF and are 
screened for entry into the study. Subjects who fail screening must have the reason(s) recorded in 
the subject’s source documents.
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject records (eg, 
medical records, office charts, hospital charts, and study-related charts) for source data verification. The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of eCRFs and queries.
The information contained in the protocol and amendments (with the exception of the 
information provided by the Sponsor on public regist ry websites) is considered the Sponsor’s 
confidential information. Only information that is previously disclosed by the Sponsor on a 
public registry website may be freely disclosed by the Investigator or its institution, or as 
outlined in the Clinical Trial Agreement. The Sponsor’s protocol, amendment and IB 
information is not to be made publicly available (for example on the Investigator’s or their 
institution’s website) without express written approval from the Sponsor. Information proposed 
for posting on the Investigator’s or their institution’s website must be submitted to the Sponsor
for review and approval, providing at least 5 business days for review.

The Investigator must obtain informed consent of the subject and/or the subject’s legal 
representative prior to any study-related procedures.
Documentation that informed consent occurred prior to  the subject’s entry into the study and of 
the informed consent process should be recorded in the subject’s source documents including the date. The original ICF signed and dated by the subject and by the person consenting the subject
prior to the subject’s entry into the study, must be maintained in the Investigator’s study files and 
a copy given to the subject. In addition, if a protocol is amended and it impacts the content of the informed consent, the ICF must be revised. Sub jects participating in the study when the amended 
protocol is implemented must be re-consented with  the revised version of the ICF. The revised 
ICF signed and dated by the subject and by the person consenting the subject must be maintained 
in the Investigator’s study files and a c opy given to the subject. Subjects in the nab-
paclitaxel/durvalumab arm who continue treatment beyond disease progression per RECIST 1.1 
will be requested to sign a consent form at time of progression and prior to treatment continuation.
14.4. Confidentiality
The Sponsor affirms the subject's right to protection against invasion of privacy and to be in compliance with ICH and other local regulations (whichever is most stringent). The Sponsorrequires the Investigator to permit the Sponsor's representatives and, when necessary, 
representatives from regulatory au thorities, to review and/or copy any medical records relevant 
to the study in accordance with local laws.
Should direct access to medical records require  a waiver or authorization separate from the 
subject’s signed ICF, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain such permission in 
writing from the appropriate i ndividual.
14.5. Protocol Amendments
Any amendment to this protocol must be approved by the Sponsor’s Clinical Research 
Physician/Medical Monitor. Amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC for written approval.Written approval must be obtained before implementation of the amended version occurs. The 
written signed approval from the IRB/EC shoul d specifically referen ce the Investig ator name, 
protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is applicable. Amendments that are administrative in nature do not require IRB/IEC approval but will be submitted to the IRB/IEC 
for information purposes.
14.6. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Review 
and Approval
Before the start of the study, the study protoc ol, ICF, and any other appropriate documents will 
be submitted to the IRB/EC with a cover letter or a form listing the documents submitted, their

documentation on all ethical a nd legal requirements for starting the study has been received by 
the Sponsor or its authorized representative. This  documentation must also include a list of the 
members of the IRB/EC and their occupation and qualifications. If the IRB/EC will not disclose 
the names, occupations and qualifications of the committee members, it should be asked to issue 
a statement confirming that the composition of the committee is in accordance with GCP. For 
example, the IRB General Assurance Number may be accepted as a substitute for this list. 
Formal approval by the IRB/EC should mention the protocol title, number, amendment number 
(if applicable), study site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable), and any other 
documents reviewed. It must mention the date on which the decision was made and must be 
officially signed by a co mmittee memb er. Before the first subject is e nrolled in the study, all 
ethical and legal requirements must be met.
The IRB/EC and, if applicable, the authorities, must be informed of all subsequent protocol 
amendments in accordance with local legal requirements. Amendments must be evaluated to 
determine whether formal approval must be sought and whether the ICF should also be revised.
The Investigator must keep a record of all comm unication with the IRB/EC  and, if applicable, 
between a coordin ating Investigator and the IRB/EC. This statement also applies to any 
communication between the Investigator (or coordinating Investigator, if applicable) and 
regulatory authorities.
Any advertisements used to recruit subjects for the study must be reviewed by the Sponsor and 
the IRB/EC prior to use.
14.7. Ongoing Information for Institutional Review Board / Ethics 
Committee
If required by legislation or the IRB/EC, the Investigator must submit to the IRB/EC:

All aspects of the study will  be carefully monitored by the Sponsor or its authorized 
representative for compliance with applicable government regulations with respect to current 
GCP and standard operating procedures.
16.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification
The Sponsor ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and 
after the study. All aspects of the study are reviewed with the Investigator and the staff at a study 
initiation visit and/or at an Investigator meeting. Prior to enrolling subjects into the study, a 
Sponsor representative or designee will review the protocol, eCRFs, procedures for obtaining 
informed consent, record keeping, and reporting of AEs/SAEs with the Investigator. Monitoring 
will include on-site visits with the Investigator and his/her staff as well as any appropriate 
communications by mail, email, fax, or telephone. During monitoring visits, the facilities, IP storage area, eCRFs, subject’s source documen ts, and all other study  documentation will be
inspected/reviewed by the Sponsor representative in  accordance with the Study Monitoring Plan.
Accuracy will be checked by performing source data verification that is a direct comparison of 
the entries made onto the eCRFs against the appropriate source documentation. Any resulting 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the Inve stigator and/or his/her staff. Any necessary 
corrections will be made directly to the eCR Fs or via queries by the Investigator and/or his/her 
staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and documentation of SAEs and their  proper recording be verified. Additional 
monitoring activities may be outlined in a study-specific monitoring plan.
16.2. Audits and Inspections
In addition to the routine monitoring proce dures, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance 
unit exists within the Sponsor. Representatives of this unit will conduct audits of clinical research activities in accordance with the Sponsor’s SOPs to evaluate compliance with Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines and regulations.
The Investigator is required to permit direct acce ss to the facilities where the study took place, 
source documents, eCRFs and applicable supporting records of subject participation for audits 
and inspections by IRB/IECs, regulatory authori ties (eg, FDA, European Medicines Agency 
[EMA], Health Canada) and company authorized representatives. The Investigator should make every effort to be available for the audits and/or inspections. If the Investigator is contacted by 
any regulatory authority regarding an inspection, he/she should contact the Sponsor immediately.udy udy

Paclitaxel /Durvalumab arm
(based on updated guidelines for Durvalumab/MEDI4736 - 09 Aug 2016 version)
General guidelines regarding treatment modification for MEDI4736 and/or nab-paclitaxel are 
provided b elow for immune-related AEs ( Table C1 ), infusion-related reactions ( Table C2 ), and 
non-immune-mediated reactions ( Table C3 ). 
These guidelines apply to AEs considered causally related to the durvalumab containing regimen 
by the reporting Investigator. Treatment modifications referring to “study regimen” would apply 
to both nab-paclitaxel and durvalumab unless AEs are not considered causally related to nab-
paclitaxel by the reporting Investigator. In that case nab-paclitaxel treatment may be continued 
alone if deemed beneficial to the subject per Investigator’s assessment.

noted below)Drug administration modifications of IP/study 
regimen will be made to manage potential 
immune-related AEs based on severity of treatment-emergent tox icities graded per NCI 
CTCAE v4.03.
In addition to the criteria for permanent 
discontinuation of IP/regimen based on CTC 
Grade/severity (table below), permanently discontinue IP/study regimen for the following 
conditions:
• Inability to reduce corticosteroid to a dose of 
≤10 mg of prednisone per day (or equivalent) 
within 12 weeks after last dose of IP/regimen
• Recurrence of a previously experienced Grade 3 
treatment-related AE following resumption of dosingIt is recommended that management of irAEs follow the guidelines 
presented in this table
- Subjects should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any alternative 
etiology (e.g. disease progression, concomitant medications, 
infections, etc.)
- In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, all events should be 
considered potentially immune related
- Symptomatic and topical therapy should be considered for low-
grade (Grade 1 or 2, unless otherwise specified) events
- For persistent (greater than 3 to 5 days) low-grade (Grade 2) or 
severe (Grade ≥3) events promptly start prednisone 1-2mg/kg/day PO 
or IV equivalent
- If symptoms recur or worsen during corticosteroid tapering 28 days 
of taper), increase the corticosteroid dose (prednisone dose [e.g. up to 
2-4mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent]) until stabilization or improvement of symptoms, then resume corticosteroid tapering at a 
slower rate (> 28 days of taper)
- More potent immunosuppressives such as TNF inhibitors (eg, 
infliximab) – (also refer to the individual sections of the immune 
related adverse event for specific type of immunosuppressive) should be considered for events not responding to systemic steroids 
- Discontinuation of IP is not mandated for Grade 3 / 4 inflammatory 
reactions attributed to local tumor response (e.g. inflammatory 
reaction at sites of metastatic disease, lymph nodes etc.). 
Continuation of IP in this situation should be based upon a benefit/risk analysis for that subjectGrade 1 No dose modification
Grade 2 Hold IP/study regimen dose 
until Grade 2 resolution to ≤ 
Grade 1
• If toxicity worsens then treat 
as Grade 3 or Grade 4
• IP/study treatment can be 
resumed once event stabilizes 
to Grade ≤1 after completion 
of steroid taper
Subjects with endocrinopathies 
who may require prolonged or 
continued steroid replacement 
can be retreated with IP/study

Neurotoxicity
Depending on the 
type of 
neurotoxicity refer 
to NCI CTCAE version 4.03 for defining the CTC

(eg, disease progression, infections, metabolic syndromes and medications, etc.)
- Monitor subject for general symptoms (headache, nausea, vertigo, 
behavior change, or weakness)
- Consider appropriate diagnostic testing (e.g. electromyogram and 
nerve conduction investigations)
- Symptomatic treatment with neurological consult as appropriate
Grade 1 No dose modifications See “Any Grade” recommendations above.
Grade 2 • For acute motor 
neuropathies or
neurotoxicity, hold IP/studyregimen dose until resolution to ≤ Grade 1
• For sensory neuropathy/ 
neuropathic pain, consider 
holding IP/study regimen

Immune mediatedperipheral
neuromotor
syndromes, such
as Guillain-Barreand myastheniagravisGeneral guidance - The prompt diagnosis of immune-mediated peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes is important, since certain subjects may unpredictably 
experience acute decompensations which can result in substantial 
morbidity or in the worst case, death. Special care should be taken for 
certain sentinel symptoms which may predict a more severe outcome, such as prominent dysphagia, rapidly progressive weakness, and signs of respiratory insufficiency or autonomic instability
- Subjects should be evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology 
(e.g. disease progression, infections, metabolic syndromes and 
medications, etc.). It should be noted that the diagnosis of immune-mediated peripheral neuromotor syndromes can be particularly challenging in subjects with underlying cancer, due to the multiple 
potential confounding effects of cancer (and its treatments) 
throughout the neuraxis. Given the importance of prompt and accurate diagnosis, it is essential to have a low threshold to obtain a 
neurological consult

- Neurophysiologic diagnostic testing (e.g. electromyogram and 
nerve conduction investigations, and “repetitive stimulation” if 
myasthenia is suspected) are routinely indicated upon suspicion of 
such conditions and may be best facilitated by means of a neurology consultation
Important to consider that the use of steroids as the primary treatment 
of Guillain-Barre is not typically considered effective. Subjects 
requiring treatment should be started with IVIG and followed by 
plasmapheresis if not responsive to IVIG
Grade 1 No dose modification For Grade 1:

 CONFIDENTIAL  AMENDMENT HISTORY  
Amendment 6  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to extend contraception requirements based on 
proposed aflibercept HD labeling language updates.  
Description of Change  Brief Rationale  Section # and Name  
Update t he length of 
time contraception is 
required after study drug 
dosing . To align with the proposed HD labeling 
update , which  the time 
contraception is needed after the last study 
drug dose, based on t he following:  the 
recommended duration of contraception 
following the last intravitreal dose 
increased from  3 months for 2  mg 
aflibercept to  for HD aflibercept. 
The 3 -month duration of contraception for 
the 2 -mg dose was based on the time 
required for all patient s to reach the lower 
limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of free 
aflibercept in plasma   plus a 
conservative 1 -month buffer . For HD 
aflibercept, the population PK model -
predicted time for 99% of patient s to reach 
the LLOQ of free aflibercept in plasma is 
 Applying the same 1 -month 
buffer utilized for 2 -mg aflibercept, the 
recommended duration of contraception 
for HD aflibercept is  Section  7.2.2  Exclusion

Minor template updates, in 
addition to minor edits and 
formatting changes.  Throughout  Throughout  
 
Amendment 4  
The primary purpose for this amendment is to simplify and extend the confirmatory testing 
hierarchy:   
To remove the initial Bonferroni -based split of the overall significance level (which had been 
introduced originally to allow simultaneous testing of the 2 hypotheses (8 mg aflibercept every 
12 weeks [HDq12] vs 2 mg aflibercept every 8 weeks [ 2q8] and 8 mg  aflibercept every 16 weeks 
[HDq16] vs 2q8) of the primary endpoint at a significance level of 0.0125 [1 -sided] each) and to 
assign the full significance level of 0.025 (1 -sided) to the first hypothesis (HDq12 vs 2q8).  The 
reason for this change is to adju st the testing sequence to the perceived clinical probability of 
success, ie, since HDq12 is more likely to succeed than HDq16 (due to the higher dosing frequency 
after the loading phase).   
1. To remove the subsequent splitting of the remaining alpha levels b etween 2 hypotheses, 
and replace it by a simpler hierarchical testing procedure in both the global statistical 
analysis plan (G -SAP) and the statistical analysis plan for EMA and PMDA (EP -SAP). 
This change allows sequential testing of hypotheses at the ful l significance level after 
successful rejection of the hypotheses which are ranked higher in the hierarchy.  The reason 
for this change is to prioritize testing of hypotheses which are deemed to be clinically more 
relevant.  
2. To allow formal statistical testi ng for superiority of the change from baseline in best 
corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at week  48 (and week 60, in the EP -SAP only) that 
controls the overall family -wise type 1 error. The formal statistical testing for superiority 
is added at the end of the  revised testing hierarchy. Hence the testing hierarchy is extended.  
3. To remove the endpoint of “Proportion of patients without retinal fluid at the foveal center 
at week 12” as a key secondary endpoint in the testing hierarchy (it remains as a secondary 
endpoint assessed at week 48). Based on recent data from another, completed study, it was 
determined that week 12 is not a reasonable time point to assess this endpoint. Analysis of 
this endpoint will be more informative at week 48 after a year of treatment.  
Of note, the updated confirmatory testing hierarchy still controls the overall family -wise type 1 
error at 0.025 level (1 -sided). These changes will be implemented after the end of enrollment but 
before database lock and before any unmasking occurs.   
The following table outlines the changes made to the protocol and the affected sections:

 CONFIDENTIAL  CLINICAL STUDY PROTO COL SYNOPSIS  
Title  A Randomized, Double -Masked, Active -Controlled Phase 2/3 Study of the 
Efficacy and Safety of High -Dose Aflibercept in Patients with Diabetic 
Macular Edema   
Site Location(s)  
 Principal Investigator  Approximately 180 clinical study sites in North America, Europe, and Asia.  
(to be determined)  
Objective(s)  The primary objective of the study is to determine if treatment with high -
dose aflibercept (HD) at intervals of 12 or 16 weeks provides noninferior 
best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) compared to 2 mg aflibercept dosed 
every 8 weeks.   
The secondary object ives of the study are:  
• to determine the effect of HD vs. 2 mg aflibercept on anatomic and 
other visual measures of response  
• to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics (PK) 
of HD.  
Exploratory objectives of the study are:  
• to determine the e ffect of HD vs. 2  mg aflibercept on additional 
anatomic measures of response  
• to study molecular drivers of diabetic macular edema (DME) or 
related diseases, the mechanism of action of afIibercept, and the 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway.  
Study Design  Phase 2/3, multi -center, randomized, double -masked study in patients with 
DME involving the center of the macula to investigate the efficacy and 
safety of HD versus 2 mg aflibercept.  
Approximately 640 eligible patients randomized into 3 treat ment groups in 
a 1:2:1 ratio to the following 3  treatment groups: 1) 2q8: 2 mg aflibercept 
every 8 weeks, following 5  initial monthly doses (n=160), 2) HDq12: HD 
aflibercept every 12 weeks, following 3 initial monthly doses (n=320), 
3) HDq16: HD aflibercep t every 16 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses 
(n=160).  
Approximately 24 patients will be included in a dense PK substudy (n=8 per 
group, with half Japanese and half non -Japanese per group). In all patients, 
blood samples for measurement of drug conce ntrations (PK) and anti -drug 
antibody (ADA) will be obtained prior to the first treatment and at 
prespecified time points throughout the course of the study. In addition, a 
DNA sample will be collected from those who sign the informed consent 
form (ICF) fo r the optional genomic substudy.   
 
 
 
 
Study Duration  The study duration for a patient during the initial phase of the study is 
approximately 96 weeks;

End of Study Definition  The end of study (EOS) is defined as the last visit of the last patient.  
Population   
 Sample Size:  Sample size is approximately 640 patients.  
 Target Population:  Patients with DME involving the center of the macula  
Treatments   
 Study Drug  
 Dose/Route/Schedule:  High -dose aflibercept (8 mg) given by intravitreal injection in extended -
dose intervals (every 12 or 16 weeks) following 3 initial monthly injections 
according to study group.  Dosing regimen modifications (DRMs) are 
permitted based on clinical criteria defined in the protocol.  
 Reference Drug  
 Dose/Route/Schedule:  Aflibercept 2 mg given by intravitreal injection every 8 weeks following 
5 initial monthly doses.   
Endpoi nts  
 Primary:  Change from baseline in BCVA at week 48.  
 Secondary:  The key secondary efficacy endpoints are:  
• Proportion of patients with a ≥2  step improvement in the Diabetic 
Retinopathy Severity Scale (DRSS) at week 48  
• Change from baseline in BCVA at week 60  
Procedures and Assessments  Efficacy procedures:  ocular examination including BCVA (Early Treatment 
Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS]) and refraction, intraocular pressure 
(IOP), slit lamp examination, indirect op hthalmoscopy, fluorescein 
angiography (FA), fundus photography (FP), spectral domain optical 
coherence tomography (SD -OCT), OCT angiography (OCTA), National 
Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire -25 (NEI -VFQ -25). Safety 
procedures: ophthalmic exams, p hysical examination, vital signs, 
electrocardiogram (ECG), adverse events, laboratory and immunogenicity 
assessments. Pharmacokinetic and genomic substudies will be conducted.  
Statistical Plan  The sample size calculation is based on testing 2 primary hypotheses for 
non-inferiority (NI) of HDq12 vs. 2q8 (control) and HDq16 vs. 2q8 (control) 
with respect to the primary endpoint of change from baseline in BCVA at 
week 48.  The NI margin is set at 4  letters for each of the primary hypotheses.   
Under the original testing strategy (prior to Amendment 4), assuming a 
standard deviation of 9.07 letters for each treatment group, and dropout rate 
of 19%, a sample size of 160 per treatment group based on tw o-sample t -
test will provide ≥90% power for each pairwise comparison.  Sample size in 
the HDq12 group is doubled to meet regulatory requirements for the safety 
                                        VV-RIM-00179129-4.0 Approved - 27 Feb 2023 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  database.  Therefore, the study sample size is estimated for a total of 640 
patients (160, 320, and 160 for 2q8, HDq12, and HDq16, respectively).  
However, under the current hierarchical testing procedure, using the same 
assumptions as indicated above, a total sample size of 640 patients for 3 
groups provides 98% power for rejecting the null hypothes is H 10, and 
subsequently 92% power for rejecting the null hypothesis H 30, for the 
primary endpoint assessing non -inferiority, with a 1 -sided t -test at 
significance level of 0.025.  
The primary hypotheses (null vs. alternative) are stated as below.  
H10: μ1 ≤ μ 0 – 4 vs. H 11:  μ 1 > μ 0 – 4 (ie, HDq12 vs. 2q8)  
H30: μ2 ≤ μ 0 – 4 vs. H 31:  μ 2 > μ 0 – 4 (ie, HDq16 vs. 2q8)  
where μ 0, μ1, μ2, are the mean change from baseline in BCVA at week 48 
for 2q8, HDq12, and HDq16, respectively. The primary efficacy analysis 
will be based on a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) with 
baseline BCVA as a covariate, treatment, baseline CRT, prior DME 
treatment, geographical region and visit as fixed effects, and interaction 
terms for treatment by visit and baseline BCVA by visit; this model will use 
the full analysis set (FAS). Full analysis set is defined as all randomized 
patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
In addition, the HDq12 and HDq16 treatment groups will be tested for non -
inferiority against the con trol group of 2q8 with respect to the following key 
secondary endpoints: change from baseline in BCVA at week 60 (non -
inferiority with NI margin of 4 letters) (only for regulatory requirements for 
European Medicines Agency [EMA] and Pharmaceuticals and Med ical 
Devices Agency [PMDA] of Japan)  and proportion of patients with a ≥2 
step improvement in DRSS at week 48 (non -inferiority with NI margin of 
15%).  The key secondary endpoint of change from baseline in BCVA at 
week 60 (SAP for EMA, PMDA [EP -SAP] only) will be analyzed with a 
model matching the one for the primary endpoint.  The proportion of patients 
with a ≥2 step improvement in DRSS at week 48 will be analyzed using the 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) method, stratified by baseline CRT, prior 
DME treatm ent, and geographical region.  
The change from baseline in BCVA at week 48 and week 60 (for the EP -
SAP) will also be tested for superiority to compare the HDq12 and HDq16 
treatment groups against the control group of 2q8.  
The overall family -wise type 1 erro r will be controlled at 0.025 one -sided 
level for testing the primary and key secondary endpoints. Adjustment for 
multiple comparisons in the primary and key secondary endpoints will be 
made with a hierarchical testing procedure.  For safety analysis, all 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized for each 
treatment group by the primary system organ class (SOC) and preferred 
terms (PT) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
dictionary (MedDRA®).  Severity and relationship t o treatment will also be 
presented by SOC and PT.  Deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), and 
TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation will also be listed 
and summarized by treatment group.  In addition, vital signs and laboratory 
tests results  will be descriptively tabulated and/or graphically presented as 
well as patient listings provided.  Treatment exposure will be summarized 
in terms of total number of treatments, duration of treatment, and proportion 
of patients maintaining, shortening, or  extending the dosing interval.

 CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION   
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes.  Diabetic 
macular edema (DME), a manifestation of diabetic retinopathy, is the primary cause of vision loss 
and blindness in  patients with diabetes ( Klein, 1984 ) (Moss, 1994 ) (Moss, 1998 ) 
(Sivaprasad,  2012 ) and the most frequent cause of blindness in young and middle -aged adults 
(Klein,  1984 ) (Moss,  1998 ).  If left untreated, approximately half of patients with DME will lose 
2 or more lines of visual acuity (VA) within 2 years ( Bandello, 2012 ) (Ciulla, 2003 ).  Among 
patients with diabetes, the prevalence of clinically significant macular edema (CSME) ranges from 
2.77% to 7.6% (Giuffrè,  2004 ) (Gulliford, 2010 ) (Ling, 2002 ) (McKay, 2000 ) (Minassian,  2012 ). 
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported the number of people with diabetes at 422 million 
in 2014, and a global prevalence of diabetes among adults at 8.5% in 2014, increased from 4.7% 
in 1980, with a continued rise in these numbers expected in com ing years ( Danaei,  2011 ) 
(NCD  Risk Factor Collaboration, 2016 ). 
Treatment options for DME include laser photocoagulation and pharmacologic interventions, 
specifically vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors and steroids.  Surgery is also 
performed in some cases as a fall -back therapeutic option, particularly for those refractory to 
treatment or with vitreomacular traction.  
Howeve r, anti -VEGF compounds have become the standard of care for the treatment of DME.  
This approach is highly attractive as it directly targets VEGF, one of the main mediators of DR 
and DME.  Vascular endothelial growth factor is a protein growth factor that both stimulates 
angiogenesis and increases vascular permeability, playing a key role in the pathophysiology of 
DME ( Ferrara, 2000 ) (Nguyen, 2006 ) (Bhagat, 2009 ).  Hypoxia and other metabolic factors trigger 
VEGF release.  VEGF induces vascular leakage and neovascularization.  While neovascularization 
is the most severe manifestation of DR, vascular leakage leading to macular edema is an important 
cause of reduced visual acuity.  
EYLEA (also known as intravitreal aflibercept injection) is a VEGF antagonist currently approved 
in over 100 countries for the treatment of DME at a dosage level of 2 mg (administered at a 
concentration of  injected intravitreally [IVT]).  EYLEA is currently approved in at least 
100 countries for additional indications that include neovascular age -related macular degeneration 
(nAMD), macular edema following  central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and branch retinal vein 
occlusion (BRVO), and in 99 countries for the treatment of myopic choroidal neovascularization 
(mCNV). EYLEA is also approved in the United States for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. 
(See the Investigator’s Brochure for additional details).  
Ranibizumab (LUCENTIS®, Novartis AG), a VEGF inhibitor, has been approved in the US and 
in the European Union for the treatment of DME.  The results of the pivotal studies used to support 
the approval of LUCENTIS ( Massin, 2010 ) (Mitchell, 2011 ) (Nguyen, 2012 ) and aflibercept 
(Brown,  2015 ) (Korobelnik, 2014 ), as well as data from large, randomized trials sponsored by the 
Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research (DRCR) Netw ork ( Elman, 2010 ) (Wells, 2015 ) using 
ranibizumab, bevacizumab, and aflibercept, support the assertion that anti -VEGF therapy may be 
the treatment option of choice, leading to vision gains for a significant number of patients.  
Additionally, in the 1 -year data from DRCR Protocol T that compared aflibercept, bevacizumab, 
and ranibizumab, aflibercept demonstrated superior efficacy in the overall population with a more

 CONFIDENTIAL  pronounced benefit in patients with baseline best -corrected visual acuity (BCVA) worse than 
20/40 ( Wells, 2015 ). 
Despite available treatments, there remains an unmet medical need for the development of 
therapies with the potential to improve important clinical outcomes.  This unmet need includes 
decreasing the treatment  burden via a reduction in the required frequency of intravitreal injections, 
improving visual and anatomic outcomes over currently available standards of care, and slowing 
or even reversing the underlying pathophysiology of the disease itself, specificall y retinal 
ischemia.  
Increasing the drug product concentration of aflibercept allows a greater amount of drug to be 
delivered IVT and thus has the potential to increase aflibercept’s pharmacological duration of 
action, and thereby provide additional benefi t to patients with DME.  The resulting extension of 
treatment intervals to every 12 weeks or 16 weeks, early after the initiation of treatment, would 
reduce the number of injections in the first treatment year.  A potential decrease in injection -related 
treatment burden and safety events could be a significant contribution to patient care and healthcare 
services.  
This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of a high -dose aflibercept with the intent of 
extending the dosing interval, with at least sim ilar functional and potentially improved anatomic 
outcomes compared to 2 mg aflibercept.

The secondary objectives of the study are as follows:  
• To determine the effect of HD vs. 2 mg aflibercept on anatomic and other visual 
measures of response  
• To evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of aflibercept   
2.3. Exploratory Objectives  
The exploratory objectives of the study are as follows:  
• To determine the effect of HD vs. 2 mg aflibercept on additi onal anatomic measures of 
response

 CONFIDENTIAL  3. HYPOTHESIS AND RATIO NALE  
3.1. Hypotheses  
Treatment with high -dose aflibercept with longer treatment intervals of at least 12 weeks will result 
in noninferior changes from baseline in BCVA at week 48 compared to 2 mg aflibercept dosed 
every 8 weeks.  
3.2. Rationale  
3.2.1.  Rationale for Study Design  
There remains an unmet medical need in the treatment of DME.  Although many pat ients benefit 
from treatment with currently available anti -VEGF agents, a sizable proportion of patients still 
need frequent IVT injections.  Long -term data suggest that visual benefits may be lost if regular 
dosing is not maintained.  In addition, dosing at an insufficient frequency may result in fluctuations 
in visual and anatomic manifestations of the disease, leading ultimately to irreversible loss of 
vision below certain visual thresholds, eg driving vision.  Longer treatment intervals will lead to 
better treatment compliance and improved long -term clinical benefit.  
Increasing the drug product concentration of aflibercept allows a greater amount of drug to be 
delivered intravitreally, with the potential for both added efficacy and an increase in afliber cept’s 
pharmacological duration of action, thereby providing additional benefit to patients with DME 
while reducing burden on both patients and physicians.  In addition, higher intravitreal aflibercept 
concentrations sustained over a longer period of time may provide better control of the anatomic 
features of DME.  
Anatomic measures of retinal thickness and retinal fluid are well -known markers of disease 
activity.  These parameters are used by clinicians to determine treatment success and/or the timing 
of fu rther retreatment. These measures will be used as secondary and exploratory endpoints in this 
phase 2/3 study, as these endpoints will help determine the timing and degree to which HD can 
extend the dosing interval relative to 2 mg aflibercept.  
The study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of HD with the objectives of achieving 
noninferior BCVA with an extended dosing interval and potential improvements in anatomic 
outcomes vs. 2 mg aflibercept.  The study is designed to investigate HD dosed every 12 or 16 
weeks after 3 initial monthly injections vs. 2 mg aflibercept dosed every 8 weeks (2q8) after 
5 initial monthly injections in patients diagnosed with DME.   
3.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
Based on considerations of manufacturing capabilities, formu lation, stability, and the likelihood 
of achieving a meaningful extension of the duration of pharmacological effect, an 8 mg IVT dose 
was selected for evaluation in the present study.  
In a nonclinical rabbit model of chronic retinal neovascularization and  vascular leak, dose -
dependent duration of leak suppression was observed after single IVT doses equivalent of up to 8 
mg in humans.  Pharmacokinetic simulations of free aflibercept concentration -time profiles in 
human vitreous using a 1 -compartment ocular model predicted

Studies with intravenous (IV) aflibercept indicated that blood pressure (BP) increase was the 
earliest pharmacodynamic indicator of systemic effect.  Two studies (PDY6655 and PDY6656) 
evaluated the effects of IV and  subcutaneous aflibercept on BP via 24 -hour ambulatory 
BP monitoring in healthy subjects.  At the lowest IV dose tested in these studies (1 mg/kg; 
PDY6656), a maximal increase of ~5 mmHg in 24 -hour mean change from baseline in systolic  BP 
(SBP) occurred by  day 6 after a single dose, SBP returning to baseline by ~30 days post -dose.  
Assuming linear PK and extrapolating C max and AUC last values (for both mean and maximum 
individual patient values) from 2 mg IVT, estimated free aflibercept systemic C max and AUC last for 
an 8 mg IVT dose are approximately 60 -142x and 98 -221x lower, respectively, than the 
corresponding values associated with a 1 mg/kg IV dose.  Although systemic concentrations of 
free aflibercept at these IVT doses are appreciably lower than those requ ired to saturate the target -
mediated elimination pathway, linear extrapolation may overestimate the exposure margins for an 
8 mg IVT dose.  A threshold dose and/or concentration of free aflibercept associated with BP 
increase has not yet been determined.  
In phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, doses up to 4 mg per eye in monthly intervals, with injection 
volumes up to 100  µl, were generally well tolerated in patients with both DME and nAMD.  In a 
small number of patients with nAMD, isolated cases of unintentional  dosing with 8  mg per eye 
occurred and were also well tolerated.  It is expected that an 8 mg IVT dose will extend the dosing 
interval relative to 2 mg IVT, thereby reducing the number of injections needed for successful 
treatment.  Hence, with the expecta tion of both a longer dosing interval resulting in a lower 
annualized number of injections, and similar safety profile, the 8 mg dose was selected for 
evaluation in this study.  
3.3. Risk -Benefit  
Benefits of Treatment with HD:  
High -dose aflibercept for IVT inje ction may provide improved patient benefit through:  
• Longer treatment intervals of every 12 weeks or longer for all patients  
• Potential for improved functional and anatomic efficacy  
• Less injection -related risk over time  
• Increased compliance by reducing th e treatment burden on patients, caregivers, 
physicians, and healthcare systems  
Extrapolated safety margins for free aflibercept after an 8 mg IVT dose, derived from linear 
extrapolation of available PK data for 2 mg IVT aflibercept, suggest an acceptable systemic safety 
profile of HD aflibercept 8 mg.  Robust generation of safety data is further planned in the phase 2 
and phase 3 trials.

 CONFIDENTIAL   
 
Risks and Risk Management of Treatment with HD:  
The safety profile of aflibercept 2 mg has been thoroughly investigated in a comprehensive clinical 
trial program including 9 phase 3 studies in the indications nAMD , CRVO, BRVO, mCNV, DME, 
and DR.  Overall, more than 4900 patients were treated with aflibercept in clinical trials.  Patients 
were treated for up to 148 weeks with aflibercept during these phase 3  studies.  No new safety 
findings were observed with long -term treatment with aflibercept.  
The safety profile of HD is anticipated to be similar to that of 2 mg aflibercept, and includes 
identified risks such as intraocular inflammation/infection, retinal tear, retinal detachment, 
transient increase in intraocular  pressure (IOP), traumatic cataract, and hypersensitivity.  
Other safety topics that are known to be associated with the systemic administration of anti -VEGF 
medications for cancer treatment include arteriothromboembolic events (ATEs), embryo -
fetotoxicity, and an increase in BP.  However, pharmacokinetic and clinical safety data of IVT 
2 mg aflibercept have indicated that the known potential risks from systemic administration of 
anti-VEGF treatments in oncology indications were not identified with IVT dosing  of 2 mg.  
Studies performed with IV administration of aflibercept demonstrated that increases in BP were 
the earliest pharmacodynamic (PD) indicator of systemic effects.  Based on the estimated exposure 
margins for free aflibercept after an 8 mg IVT dose for a 5 mmHg mean increase in SBP as 
described above, a meaningful increase in BP is not anticipated for the 8  mg IVT dose.    
An objective of this study in DME patients is to assess patient safety.  Robust generation of safety 
data is planned in this phase  2/3 trial to evaluate potential systemic exposure -related adverse events 
(AEs) such as changes in BP and incidence of ocular safety events.  Safety will be assessed by 
collection of vital signs (including careful monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and 
temperature), ocular assessments, AEs, laboratory assessments, and sparse PK sampling.  
Additionally, the aflibercept PK profile (via dense sampling for drug concentration and PK 
evaluation) and PD effects (ie, BP changes) will be evaluated in a dense PK substudy.  
As risk minimization measures, patients and investigators will be informed about the anticipated 
safety profile of HD and exclusion criteria will be applied to account for safety topics such as 
hypersensitivity, pregnancy, ATEs, and uncontrol led hypertension.  
Overall Risk -Benefit Balance:  
Based on the available preclinical and clinical data, the benefit -risk assessment of HD  aflibercept  
is considered as positive and supports the participation of patients with DME in the clinical trial 
program.  
Recognizing that “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID -19) pandemic will have an impact on the 
conduct of clinical trials, the Sponsor does not intend to screen any patient in this study in a specific 
location or area until the COVID -19 pandemic is controlled  such that patients can safely participate 
in the study.  Until then, the Sponsor plans to continue to obtain approvals from Health 
Authorities/Ethics Committees (ECs) to enable initiation of study sites for this study, as allowed 
by local laws and regulat ions.  Site initiation visits will then be determined based on the sites’ 
ability to proceed.

 CONFIDENTIAL  6. STUDY DESIGN   
6.1. Study Description and Duration  
This phase 2/3, multi -center, randomized, double -masked study in patients with DME involving 
the center of the macula will investigate the efficacy and safety of HD aflibercept versus 
2 mg aflibercept (through week 96; year 2)  
 
The study consists of a screening/baseline period, a treatment period, and an EOS visit at week 96. 
 
A total of approximately 640 eligible patients will be ra ndomized into 3 treatment groups in a 1:2:1 
ratio as follows: 1) 2q8: 2 mg aflibercept every 8 weeks, following 5  initial monthly doses (n=160), 
2) HDq12: HD aflibercept every 12 weeks, following 3 initial monthly doses (n=320), 3) HDq16: 
HD aflibercept ev ery 16 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses (n=160) ( Figure  1). 
Patients will be stratified based on baseline CRT (<400µm, ≥400 µm), prior DME treatm ent (yes, 
no), and geographical region (Rest of world, Japan).  Sham injections will be given at all visits 
when an active injection is not planned.  All patients will be followed every 4 weeks through week 
96. 
The primary analysis will take place once all  patients have completed week 48 (or prematurely 
discontinued), with additional analyses after all patients have completed week 60, and after all 
patients have completed the study at week 96.   
Safety will be assessed by ophthalmic exams, collection of vit al signs (including heart rate, BP, 
and temperature), AEs, and laboratory assessments.  All AEs reported in this study will be coded 
using the currently available version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA®).  
Approximately 24 pati ents will be included in a dense PK substudy (n=8 per group, with half 
Japanese and half non -Japanese per group).  For details refer to Table  3. 
In all patients, blood samples for measurement of drug concentrations (PK) and ADA will be 
obtained prior to the first treatment and at prespecified time points throughout the course of the 
study (see Schedule of Events,  Table  2).  In addition, a DNA sample will be collected from those 
who sign the informed consent form (ICF) for the optional genomic substudy.   
Dosing schedules appear in Figure  2 and  are described below.

Dose Regimen Modifications/Rescue Regimen  
For masking purpose s, assessments for dose regimen modifications (DRMs) will be performed in 
all participants at all visits (through the IWRS) beginning at week 16.   Based on these assessments, 
patients in the HD groups may have their treatment intervals shortened (year 1 an d year 2) or 
extended (year 2).  The minimum interval between injections will be 8 weeks which is considered 
a rescue regimen for patients randomized to HD aflibercept and unable to tolerate a dosing interval 
greater than every 8  weeks.  Patients in the af libercept 2 mg group will remain on fixed q8 dosing 
throughout the study (ie, will not have modifications of their treatment intervals regardless of the 
outcomes of the DRM assessments).  
Year 1: Baseline to Week 52  
Beginning at week 16, patients in the HD  groups will have the dosing interval shortened  (at the 
visits described below) if BOTH of the following criteria are met:  
1. >10 letter loss in BCVA from week 12 in association with persistent or worsening DME 
AND  
2. >50 µm increase in CRT from week 12  
(It should be noted that the change in CRT for these criteria will be assessed at the site.)  
If a patient in the HDq12 group or the HDq16 group meets both criteria at week 16 or week 20, 
the patient will be dosed with 8 mg aflibercept at that visit and will co ntinue on a rescue regimen 
(aflibercept 8 mg, every 8 weeks).  If a patient in the HDq16 group who has not met the criteria at 
week 16 or 20 meets both criteria at week 24, the patient will be dosed with 8  mg aflibercept at 
that visit and will continue on q12 week dosing.  
For patients whose interval was not shortened to q8 dosing at or before week 24, the interval will 
be shortened if the DRM criteria are met at a subsequent dosing visit.  Patients in the HDq12 group 
who meet the criteria will receive the planned dose at that visit and will then continue on a rescue

 CONFIDENTIAL  regimen (aflibercept 8 mg, every 8 weeks).  Patients in the HDq16 group who meet these criteria 
will receive the planned dose at that visit and will then continue to be dosed every 12 weeks if t hey 
were on a 16 -week interval, or switch to the rescue regimen (aflibercept 8mg, every 8 weeks) if 
they were previously shortened to a 12 -week interval.  Therefore, a patient randomized to HDq16 
whose injection interval has been shortened to q12 will have  their injection interval further 
shortened to q8 if these criteria are met at any subsequent dosing visit.  
Year 2: Week 52 to Week 96 (End of Study)  
From week 52 through the end of study (year 2) , all patients in the HD groups will continue to 
have the interval shortened in 4 -week intervals if the DRM criteria for shortening are met at dosing 
visits using the DRM criteria described above for year 1.  As in year 1, the minimum dosing 
interval for p atients in all treatment groups is every 8 weeks.  
In addition to shortening of the interval , all patients in the HD groups (including patients whose 
interval was shortened during year 1) may be eligible for interval extension  (by 4 -week 
increments), if BOT H the  following criteria are met at dosing visits in year 2 : 
1. <5 letter loss in BCVA from week 12 AND  
2. CRT <300 µm on  SD-OCT  (or <320 µm on Spectralis SD -OCT)  
For patients who do not meet the criteria for shortening or extension of the interval, the dosing 
interval will be maintained.  
As in year 1, all patients in all treatment groups (including the 2q8 group) will be evaluated against 
both DRM criteria at all visits through the IWRS for masking purposes.  However, changes to 
dosing schedule will only be im plemented as described above for those patients randomized to 
HDq12 or HDq16 treatment groups. No changes to the dosing schedule will be made to the 2q8 
treatment group at any time.

No formal interim analysis is planned.  However, the primary analysis for this study will be 
performed once all patients reach week 48, with a subsequent analysis performed when all patients

efficacy.  All members of the SC are masked with regard to treatment assignments throughout the 
study.   
6.3.2.  Anti -Platelet Trialists Collaboration A djudication Committee  
Potential ATEs will be evaluated by a masked adjudication committee according to criteria 
formerly applied and published by the Anti -Platelet Trialists’ Collaboration (APTC) prior to 
database unmasking (Antithrombotic Trialists’ Colla boration 1994; Antithrombotic Trialists’ 
Collaboration 2002).  Arterial thromboembolic events as defined by the APTC criteria include 
nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal ischemic stroke, nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke, or death 
resulting from vascular or  unknown causes.  The committee will include at least 2  cardiologist -
equivalent adjudicators, and the activities of the committee will be governed by a charter.

 CONFIDENTIAL  6.3.3.  Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will meet  periodically to review the ongoing 
safety of patients in the study and provide recommendations to continue or terminate the study 
depending upon these reviews.  The operation of the IDMC is governed by a charter that describes 
the group’s frequency of mee ting, procedures (including but not limited to periodic safety 
monitoring), and requirements for reporting its observations to the sponsor.  The IDMC oversight 
will continue through the last patient’s completion of visit 26 EOS visit (week 96)  
  
During the course of the study, the SC and the IDMC keep each other informed in order to assess 
all relevant safety information in a timely and efficient manner.  Communications between SC and 
IDM C will only include masked data.

screening visits and at randomization  
7.3. Premature Withdrawal from the Study  
A patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, and without 
repercussion.  
The investigator and/or sponsor have t he right to withdraw a patient from the study if it is no longer 
in the interest of the patient to continue in the study, or if the patient’s continuation in the study 
places the scientific outcome of the study at risk (eg, if a patient does not or cannot follow study 
procedures).  An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the study uninterpretable; therefore, 
unnecessary withdrawal of patients should be avoided.  
Patients who are withdrawn prematurely from the study will be asked to complete the early 
termination visit (EOS visit, [visit 26]  as described in Section  9.1.4 .  
Rules for discontinuation of the study or study treatment  (permanent or temporary) are discussed 
in Section  8.3.2 .

 CONFIDENTIAL  8. STUDY TREATMENTS  
8.1. Investigational and Reference Treatments  
The HD drug product will be s upplied for this study as an aqueous solution in sterile, sealed, single -
use vials for IVT administration at a concentration of 114.3 mg/mL aflibercept which will be 
delivered in an injection volume of 70 µl (0.07 mL).  
Intravitreal aflibercept injection 2 mg will be supplied for this study as an aqueous solution in 
sterile, sealed, single -use vials for IVT administration at a concentration of 40 mg/mL delivered 
in an injection volume of 50 μL (0.05 mL).  
Empty vials will be supplied in sham injection kits.  
Instructions on dose preparation are provided in the pharmacy manual.  
Fellow eye treatment will be allowed with 2 mg aflibercept, throughout the main study phase  
, at the investigator’s discretion for indications approved by governing au thorities. 
The treated fellow eye will not be considered an additional study eye.  
8.2. Rescue Treatment  
There is no alternative rescue treatment defined for this study.  However, patients in the HDq12 
and HDq16 groups meeting the DRM criteria for shortening may  be shortened to intervals as short 
as every 8 weeks, which is considered a rescue regimen.  See Section  6.1.  
8.3. Dosing Modification and Study Treatment Discontinuation Rules  
8.3.1.  Dosing Modification  
Dosing modification for an individual patient is not allowed.  
8.3.2.  Study and Study Drug Discontinuation  
A patient may withdraw from study drug or the study at any time at his/her own request, or may 
be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, 
or administrative reasons. This is expected to be uncommon.  
Patients must be withdrawn if any of the following occurs:  
• Relevant laboratory abnormality or SAEs, if the sponsor or  investigator sees this as 
medical reason to warrant withdrawal.  
• AE (ocular or nonocular) that, from the patient’s or the investigator’s view, is severe 
enough to require withdrawal from the study. The investigator must notify the sponsor 
immediately if a patient is withdrawn because of an AE/SAE.  
• At the discretion of the treating investigator. The development of conditions, which 
would have prevented a patient’s entry into the study according to the selection criteria, 
is no reason per se for withdrawal. However, the withdrawal in such cases remains at 
the discretion of the treating investigator.

interest or administrative decision for a reason other than an AE/SAE.  
• A female patient becomes pregnant (see Section  10.1.3 ). 
• Lost to follow -up. 
• Decision by the sponsor to halt the entire study.  
Patients may be withd rawn if any of the following occurs:  
• If any treatment for DME other than study interventions is given in the study eye.  
• Systemic anti -angiogenic agents are taken by the patient during the study.  
• If, in the investigator's opinion, continuation in the stud y would be harmful to the 
patient’s well -being.  
• At the specific request of the sponsor and in liaison with the investigator (eg, obvious 
noncompliance or safety concerns).  
Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug should be encouraged to remain in the 
study.  Those who agree and do not withdraw from the study  will be asked to return to the clinic 
for all remaining study visits per the visit schedule.  
Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug and who opt to withdraw from the study 
will be asked to complete study assessments, per Section  9.1.3 . 
8.4. Method of Treatment Assignment  
Approximately 640 patients will be randomized into 3 treatm ent groups in a ratio of 1:2:1 to 
receive either 2 mg aflibercept every 8 weeks following 5 initial monthly doses (2q8), HD every 
12 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses (HDq12), or HD every 16 weeks following 3 initial 
monthly doses (HDq16), according to a central randomization scheme provided by an interactive 
web response system (IWRS) to the designated, unmasked investigator or study coordinator (or 
unmasked qualified designee).  Randomization will be stratified according to baseline CRT 
(<400  µm, ≥4 00 µm), prior treatment for DME (yes, no) and geographic region 
(Rest  of world,  Japan).  
8.5. Masking  
The study will be conducted in double -masked fashion.  Study patients and masked study site 
personnel will remain masked to all randomization assignments throu ghout the main study.  The 
Regeneron Medical/Study Director, study monitor, and any other Regeneron and contract research 
organization (CRO) personnel who are in regular contact with the study site will remain masked 
to all patient randomization assignment s.   
To preserve masking, sham injections will be performed for all patients at treatment visits in which 
patients do not receive an active injection through week 92.  
A masked physician will be assigned to do the following:  1) assess AEs, 2) perform all study 
procedures except those related to study drug injection, and 3) perform the masked assessment of 
                                        VV-RIM-00179129-4.0 Approved - 27 Feb 2023 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  efficacy.  A separate, unmasked physician will administer treatment in the study eye (ie, perform 
study drug injection or sham injection) ( Table  1). 
The unmasked physician or designee will not have any role in the study beyond the receipt, 
tracking, preparation, destruction, and administration of study drug, and assessing safety during 
the observation period following study drug administration.  The masked physician will provide 
assessments for the IWRS to determine whether the patient has met DRM criteria for shortening 
or extending the interval.     
Every effort must be made to ensure that all other study site personnel other than those designated 
as unmasked remain masked to treatment assignment.  
Masked and unmasked roles will be assumed for the entire study, and switching from an unmasked 
to a masked role after the first patient is randomized at a site is not permitted.  Any deviation to 
the roles above must first be approved by the sponsor.  This must be properly documented before 
any patients are treated, and the site signature and delegation log mus t be maintained as new 
personnel are added to the study team.

 CONFIDENTIAL  8.8.1.  Prohibited Medications and Procedures  
Study Eye:  
Patients are not allowed to receive any standard or investi gational treatment for DME in the study 
eye other than their assigned study treatment with HD or 2 mg aflibercept, as specified in the 
protocol.  This includes medications administered locally (eg, IVT, topical, juxtascleral, or 
periorbital routes) with th e intent of treating DME in the study eye.  
Fellow Eye:  
If the fellow eye has DME, or any other approved indication, 2 mg aflibercept will be allowed and 
supplied through the IWRS.  Once the fellow eye receives aflibercept 2  mg therapy during the 
study, AEs/SAEs will be assessed as related/not related to aflibercept 2  mg treatment in the fellow 
eye in addition to being assessed as related/not related to the study drug (delivered to the study 
eye), IVT injection -procedure, and other protocol -specified proc edures.  Patients are not allowed 
to receive any other anti -VEGF agent in the fellow eye.  
Patients enrolled in the dense PK substudy cannot receive 2 mg aflibercept in the fellow eye before 
providing a PK sample at visit 3, week 4.  
Non-Ocular (Systemic):  
Non-ocular (systemic) standard or investigational treatments for DME of the study or fellow eye 
are not permitted.

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.1.1.1.  Footnotes for the Schedule of Events Table  
1. An optional visit for all patients on days 60 to 64 (after the third injection) to collect a PK 
sample and assess heart rate and BP (no temperature measures require d) as well as 
concomitant medications and AEs.   
2. Signed only by patients participating in the dense PK substudy and in addition to the study 
ICF. 
3. The optional genomic substudy ICF should be presented to patients at the screening visit 
and may be signed at any subsequent visit at which the patient chooses to participate after 
screening.  The genomic DNA sample should be collected on day 1/baseline (pre -dose) or 
at any study visit from patients who have signed the substudy ICF.  
4. The optional future biomedical research substudy ICF should be presented to patients and 
signed at the screening visit.   
5. Refer to pharmacy manual for study drug injection guidelines.  Following study drug 
injection, patients will be observed for approximately 30  minutes.  
6. Assessments fo r DRM criteria will occur in all patients at all visits for masking purposes 
beginning at week 16.  Actual DRMs will be implemented as described in Section  6.1. 
7. Patients enrolled at sites participating in the optional visual function substudy may undergo 
additional visual function tests.  See study procedure manual for details.  
8. Intraocular pressure will be measured at all study visits (bilateral).  On d ays when study 
drug is administered, IOP should be measured pre -dose (bilaterally) by the masked 
investigator (or designee) and approximately 30 minutes after administration of study drug 
(study eye only) by the unmasked investigator (or designee). IOP wil l be measured using 
Goldmann applanation tonometry or Tono -pen™ and the same method of measurement 
must be used in each patient throughout the study.  
9. Indirect ophthalmoscopy will be performed bilaterally at all visits by the masked 
investigator.  On days w hen study drug is administered, it should also be performed 
immediately after administration of study drug (study eye only) by the unmasked 
investigator.  
10. The same SD -OCT/FA/FP imaging system used at screening and day 1 must be used at all 
follow -up visits in each patient.  Images will be taken in both eyes before dosing at each 
required visit.  For FA, the study eye will be the transit eye and images should be collected 
using the widest field available.  If available, sites should also submit an optional ul tra-
widefield color photograph.   
11. Details on an optional substudy evaluating OCTA are provided in study procedure manual.  
Images will be collected at the same time points as FA/FP.  
12. Vital signs (BP, heart rate, temperature) should be measured prior to inj ection and any 
blood sampling.  When possible, timing of all BP assessments should be within 2 hours of 
clock time of dosing on day 1.  Table  3 shows addi tional measurements for patients 
enrolled in the dense PK substudy.

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.2.2.6.  Best Corrected Visual Acuity  
Visual function of the study eye and the fellow eye will be assessed using the ETDRS protocol 
(Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Research Group, 1985 ) at 4 meters at each study 
visit specified in Table  2 and Table 4.  Visual acuity examiners must be certified to ensure 
consistent measurement of BCVA. They must remain masked per Section  8.5, but whenever 
possible, should also remain masked to prior BCVA measures and study eye.  Best corrected visual 
acuity should be assessed before any other ocular proce dures are performed.  A detailed protocol 
for conducting visual acuity testing and refraction can be found in the study procedure manual.  
Patients enrolled at sites participating in the optional visual function substudy may undergo 
additional visual funct ion tests.   
9.2.2.7.  Quality of Life Questionnaire  
Vision -related quality of life (QoL) will be assessed using the NEI VFQ -25 (see study procedure 
manual) in the interviewer -administered format at visits specified in Table  2 and Table 4.  The 
NEI VFQ -25 will be administered by masked certified personnel.   
9.2.3.  Safety Procedures (non -ocular)  
Safety procedures to assess AEs and SAEs include:  
9.2.3.1.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including BP, heart rate, and temperature, will be collected pre -dose at designated time 
points according to Table  2 and Table 4.  
 
When possible, BP assessments will be obtained using AOBP measurement with the Omron Model 
HEM 907XL (or comparable).  Measu res will be taken in triplicate and a mean measure as 
displayed by the device will be recorded in the EDC.  Detailed instructions can be found in the 
study procedure manual.  
9.2.3.2.  Physical Examination  
A physical examination, including height and weight, will be performed at the screening visit.  
9.2.3.3.  Electrocardiogram  
A standard 12 -lead ECG measurement will be measured at visits specified in Table  2.  Heart rate 
will be recorded from the ventricular rate and the PR, QRS, RR, and QT intervals will be recorded.  
The ECG strips or report will be retained with the source documentation.  Electrocardiograms will 
be forwarded to a central reader.  
9.2.3.4.  Laboratory Testing  
Hematol ogy, blood chemistry, HbA1c, urinalysis, and serum pregnancy testing samples will be 
analyzed by a central laboratory.  All samples collected for laboratory assessments will be obtained 
prior to administration of study drug.  At visits at which FA is perfo rmed, urinalysis samples must 
be collected before FA to avoid false elevations in urine protein values.  Detailed instructions for 
blood sample collection are in the laboratory manual provided to study sites.

Women of childbearing potential must have a documented negative serum pregnancy test before 
randomization.  Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at every treatment visit, and a negative 
result must be documented before study eye treatment (active or sham) or fellow eye treatment can 
be administered.   
Abnormal Laboratory Values and Laboratory Adverse Events  
All laboratory values must be reviewed by the masked investigator or authorized designee.  
Significantly abnormal test results that occur after start of treatment must be repeated to confirm 
the nature and degree of the abnormality.  When necessary, appropriate ancillary investigations 
should be initiated.  If the abnormality fails to resolve or cannot be explained by events or

be consulted.   
The clinical significance of an abnormal test value, within the context of the disease under stu dy, 
must be determined by the masked investigator.  
Criteria for reporting laboratory values as an AE are provided in  Section  10.1.1 . 
9.2.4.  Drug Concentrati on and Measurements  
Blood samples for concentrations of free, bound, adjusted bound, and total aflibercept in plasma 
will be collected at the visits and time points listed in Table  2 and Table  3.  Instructions for PK 
blood sample collection will be included in the laboratory manual provided to study site s.  
9.2.5.  Immunogenicity Measurements and Samples  
Serum samples for ADA and NAb assessment will be collected at time points listed in Table  2.   
9.2.6.  Future Biomedical Research (Optional)  
Additional analyses may be performed on leftover PK and ADA samples from patients who 
consent to participate in the optional future biomedical research substudy.  Samples will be banked 
in long -term storage.  The unused  PK/AD A samples will be stored for up to 15 years after the final 
date of the database lock.  The unused samples may be utilized for future biomedical research of 
DME, related diseases or pathways blocked by study treatment, and any adverse reactions that 
may em erge.  These samples may also be used for assay development and assay validation 
purposes.  After 15 years, any residual samples will be destroyed.  The results of these future 
biomedical research analyses will not be presented in the clinical study report .  
9.2.6.1.  Pharmacogenomic Analysis (Optional)  
Patients who agree to participate in the genomics substudy will be required to consent to this 
optional substudy before collection of the samples.  Whole blood samples for DNA extraction 
should be collected on day 1/b aseline (predose) but can be collected at a later study visit.  
DNA  samples will be collected for pharmacogenomics analyses to understand the genetic 
determinants of efficacy and safety associated with the treatments in this study and the molecular 
basis o f DME and related diseases.  These samples will be single -coded as defined by the 
International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) guideline E15.  Samples will be stored for up to 15 
years after the final date of the database lock.  If there are specific site or country requirements 
involving the pharmacogenomic analyses which the sponsor is unable to comply with, samples 
will not be collected at those sites.   
The purpose of the pharmacogenomic analyses is to identify genomic associations with clinical or 
biom arker response to aflibercept, other DME clinical outcome measures, and possible AEs.   In 
addition, associations between genomic variants and prognosis or progression of DME as well as 
related diseases may also be studied.  These data may be used or combin ed with data collected 
from other studies to identify and validate genomic markers related to the study drug, target 
pathway, or DME  and related  diseases.   
Analyses may include sequence determination or single nucleotide polymorphism studies of 
candidate genes and surrounding genomic regions.  Other methods including whole -exome

10. SAFETY EVALUATION AN D REPORTING  
10.1. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
10.1.1.  General Guidelines  
The investigator must promptly record all clinical events occurring during the study data collection 
period from the time of signing of the ICF to the end of the on -treatment period (defined as th e 
time from signing of the ICF to the last dose of study drug (active or sham) plus 30 days, or to the 
last study visit (week 96  (see Section  11.4.5.1 ).  
Medical conditions that existed or were diagnosed prior to the first dose of study drug will be 
recorded as part of medical history.  Abnormal laboratory values and vital signs observed at the 
time of inf ormed consent should also be recorded as medical history.  Any subsequent worsening 
(ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre -existing condition that 
is temporally associated with the use of the study drug should also b e recorded as an AE.  
At each visit, the investigator will determine whether any AEs have occurred by evaluating the 
patient.  Adverse events may be directly observed, reported spontaneously by the patient, or by 
questioning the patient at each study visit.   Patients should be questioned in a general way, without 
asking about the occurrence of any specific symptoms.  The masked investigator must assess all 
AEs to determine seriousness, severity, and causality, in accordance with the definitions in 
Section  10.2.  The masked investigator’s assessment must be clearly documented in the site’s 
source documentation with the masked investigator’s signature.  The investigator should follow 
up on SAEs until  they have resolved or are considered clinically stable; AEs should be followed 
until they are resolved or last study visit, whichever comes first.  
Always report the diagnosis as the AE or SAE term.  When a diagnosis is unavailable, report the 
primary sign  or symptom as the AE or SAE term with additional details included in the narrative 
until the diagnosis becomes available.  If the signs and symptoms are distinct and do not suggest 
a common diagnosis, report them as individual entries of AE or SAE.   
Labo ratory results, vital signs, and other diagnostic result s or findings  should be appraised by the 
masked investigator to determine their clinical significance.   Isolated abnormal laboratory results, 
vital sign findings, or other diagnostic findings (ie, not  part of a reported diagnosis) should be 
reported as AEs if they are symptomatic, lead to study drug discontinuation or  dose reduction,  
require corrective treatment, or constitute an AE in the investigator ’s clinical judgment . 
For events that are serious d ue to hospitalization, the reason for hospitalization must be reported 
as the SAE (diagnosis or symptom requiring hospitalization).  A procedure is not an AE or SAE, 
but the reason for the procedure may be an AE or SAE.  Pre -planned (prior to first dose of  study 
drug) procedure s, treatment s requiring hospitalization for pre -existing conditions that do not 
worsen in severity, and admission for palliative or social care should not be reported as SAEs (see 
Section  10.2 for Definitions).

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 66 
 CONFIDENTIAL  For deaths, the underlying or immediate cause of death should always be reported as an SAE.   
Any SAE that may occur subsequent to the reporting period (after the end of  the on -treatment 
period) that the masked investigator assesses as related to study drug should also be reported.  
All AEs, SAEs , and pregnancy reports are to be reported according to the procedures in 
Section  10.1.3 .   
10.1.2.  Reporting Procedure  
All events (serious and non -serious) must be reported with masked investigator’s assessment of 
the event’s seriousness, severity, and causality to the study drug, study conduct, and/or injection 
procedure.  For SAEs, a detailed narrative summarizing the co urse of the event, including its 
evaluation, treatment, and outcome should be provided on the AE case report form (CRF).  Specific 
or estimated dates of event onset, treatment, and resolution should be included, when available.  
Medical history, concomitan t medications, and laboratory data that are relevant to the event should 
also be summarized in the narrative.  For fatal events, the narrative should state whether an autopsy 
was or will be performed and include the results if available.  Information not a vailable at the time 
of the initial report must be documented in a follow -up report.  Source documents (including 
hospital or medical records, diagnostic reports, etc.) will be summarized in the narrative on the 
AE CRF, and retained at the study center and  available upon request.   
Urgent safety queries must be followed up and addressed promptly.  Follow -up information and 
response to non -urgent safety queries should be combined for reporting to provide the most 
complete data possible within each follow -up.  
10.1.3.  Events that Require Expedited Reporting to Sponsor  
The following events also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning 
of the event:  
• SAEs  
• Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to report to the sponsor (or designee), within 24  hours of identification, 
any pregnancy occurring in a female or female partner of a male , during the study or 
within  90 days of the last dose of study  drug.  Any complication of pregnancy affecting 
a female study patient or female partner of a male study patient, and/or fetus and/or 
newborn that meets the SAE criteria, must be reported as an SAE.  Outcome for all 
pregnancies should be reported to the sp onsor.  
10.2. Definitions  
10.2.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a study drug which may or 
may not have a causal relationship with the study drug.  Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnorm al laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which is temporally 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug (ICH 
E2A Guideline.  Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Repor ting, Oct 1994).

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 67 
 CONFIDENTIAL  10.2.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated 
to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient is a passenger ). 
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event.  This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization .  In-
patient hospitalization is defined as admission to a hospital (any duration) or an 
emergency room for longer than 24 hours.  Prolongation of existing hospitalization is 
defined as a hospital stay that is longer than was originally anticipated for the event, or 
is prolonged due to the development of a new AE as determined by the investigator or 
treating physician.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruptio n of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).   
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is an important medical event . Important medical events may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the pati ent or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above (eg, 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or developm ent of drug 
dependency or drug abuse).  
An ocular important medical event may include the following:  
• An AE that requires either surgical or medical intervention to prevent permanent loss 
of vision  
• Substantial, unexplained vision loss or an AE that causes su bstantial vision loss  
Criteria for reporting SAEs must be followed for these events.  
10.2.3.  Severity  
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale:  
Mild: Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient’s normal functioning level.  It 
may be an annoyance.  Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief of symptoms but may 
be given because of personality of the patient.  
Moderate:  Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to health.  It is 
uncomforta ble or an embarrassment.  Treatment for symptom may be needed.  
Severe:  Produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a definite hazard 
to the patient’s health.  Treatment for symptom may be given and/or patient hospitalized.

 CONFIDENTIAL  If a laboratory value is considered an AE, its severity should be based on the degree of 
physiological impairment the value indicates (see Section  9.2.3.4  and Section  10.1.1  for further 
information regarding the assessment of laboratory values as AEs).  
10.2.4.  Causality  
The masked investigator must provide cau sality assessment as to whether or not there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event, based on evidence or facts, his/her 
clinical judgment, and the following definitions.  The causality assessment must be made based on 
the avail able information and can be updated as new information becomes available.  
The following factors should be considered when assessing causality:  
• Temporal relationship: time to onset vs. time drug was administered  
• Nature of the reactions: immediate vs. long t erm 
• Clinical and pathological features of the events  
• Existing information about the drug and same class of drugs  
• Concomitant medications  
• Underlying and concurrent illnesses  
• Response to dechallenge (drug discontinuation) or dose reduction, when applicab le  
• Response to rechallenge (re -introduction of the drug) or dose increase, when 
applicable  
• Patient’s medical and social history  
Causality to the study drug:  
The relationship of AEs to study drug will be assessed by the masked investigator, and will be a  
clinical decision based on all available information.  The following question will be addressed:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the study drug?  
The possible answers are:  
• Related:  
− The AE follows a reasonable temporal  sequence from study drug administration, 
and cannot be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, patient’s clinical 
condition (eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, concomitant medications), 
or other external factors.  
or 
− The AE follows a  reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration, 
and is a known reaction to the drug under study or its class of drugs, or is predicted 
by known pharmacology.  
• Not Related:

 CONFIDENTIAL  − The AE does not follow a reasonable sequence from study drug administra tion, or 
can be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, patient’s clinical state 
(eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications) or 
other external factors.  
For patients receiving fellow eye injections, AEs will also be assessed as related/ not related to 
“aflibercept 2mg (fellow eye)”.  
Causality to the Injection Procedure  
The relationship of AEs to the injection procedure will be assessed by the masked investigator, 
and is a clinical decision based on all available in formation.  The following question will be 
addressed:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the injection procedure?  
The possible answers are:  
• Related:   There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused b y the 
injection procedure.  
• Not Related:   There is no reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused 
by the injection procedure.  
Causality to the other protocol -specified procedures (excluding injection procedure):  
• Related:  
− The AE follows a reas onable temporal sequence from a protocol -specified 
procedure, and cannot be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, 
patient’s clinical condition (eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, 
concomitant medications), or other external factors.  
• Not Related:  
− The AE does not follow a reasonable sequence from a protocol -specified procedure, 
or can be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, patient’s clinical state 
(eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medication s) or 
other external factors.  
10.3. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will monitor the safety of study patient at his/her site(s) as per the requirements 
of this protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  Any questions or 
concerns shoul d be discussed with the sponsor in a timely fashion.  The sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites.  The Medical/Study Director will have primary 
responsibility for the emerging safety profile of the compound, but will be supported by other 
departments (eg, Pharmacovigilance; Risk Management; Biostatistics and Data Management).  
Safety monitoring will be performed on an ongoing basis (eg, individual review of SAEs) and on 
a periodic, cumulative aggregate basis.  In addition, the IDMC  will review the ongoing safety of 
patients in the study and provide recommendations to continue or terminate the study depending 
upon these reviews (see Section  6.3.3 ).

 CONFIDENTIAL  10.4. Notifying Health Authorities, Institutional Review Board /Ethics 
Committee, and Investigators  
During the study, the sponsor and/or the CRO will inform health authorities, ECs/Institutional 
Review Boards (IRBs), and the participating investigators of any SUSARs (suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions) occurring in other study centers or other studies of the active study drug 
(HD), as appropriate per local reporting requirements.  In addition, the sponsor and/or CRO will 
comply with any additional local safety reporting requirements.  All notifications to investigators 
will contain only masked information.   
Upon receipt of the sponsor’s notification of a SUSAR that occurred with the study drug, the 
investigator will inform the EC s/IRBs unless delegated to the sponsor.  
Event expectedness for high -dose and for 2  mg aflibercept is assessed against the reference safety 
information section of the current Investigator’s Brochure that is effective for expedited safety 
reporting.   
At the  completion of the study, the sponsor will report all safety observations made during the 
conduct of the trial in the clinical study report to health authorities and ECs/IRBs as appropriate.

 CONFIDENTIAL  11. STATISTICAL PLAN  
Due to differing requirements for the submission  to various global regulatory authorities, 
2 different testing strategies will be described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP):  a global plan 
(G-SAP), and a plan that specifically addresses requirements from EMA and PMDA (EP -SAP).  
This section provid es the basis for these plans which will be used to govern the detailed analysis 
of the study.  The G -SAP will constitute the primary analysis for the study.  The EP -SAP will be 
used for submission to the EMA/PMDA regulatory authorities.  
11.1. Statistical Hypoth esis  
The 2 primary hypotheses to be tested are the non -inferiority (NI) of HDq12 vs. 2q8 (control) and 
HDq16 vs. 2q8 (control) with respect to the primary endpoint of change from baseline in BCVA 
at week 48.  The non -inferiority margin is set at 4 letters  for each of the primary hypotheses.   
Justification of Non -inferiority Margin : 
Based on the pooled data analysis of VIVID and VISTA studies in patients with DME treated with 
aflibercept 2q8, the mean change from baseline in BCVA at week  48 was 10.4 (95% C I: 9.41 to 
11.4) letters.  Using the lower limit of this confidence interval, a non -inferiority (NI) margin of 4 
letters would preserve greater than 50% (57.5%) of the treatment effect of aflibercept 2q8 when 
compared to a putative placebo. The assumption that mean change in vision for a placebo group 
would be 0 letters is considered conservative as studies that included sham/placebo treatment 
demonstrated larger proportions of patients losing vision compared to laser treated groups 
(Blankenship, 1979 ) (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Research Group, 1985 ).  This 
provides justification of the NI margin based on statistical considerations.  
Regarding clinical relevance of the NI margin for the BCVA endpoint, previous studies with anti -
VEGF therapies in other indications regarded a difference of 5 letters as clinically relevant.  For 
example, the CLARITY ( Sivaprasad, 2017 ) study in diabetic retinopathy (compar ing aflibercept 
to panretinal photocoagulation) and the CATT study ( CATT Research Group, 2011 ) in nAMD 
(comparing ranibizumab and bevacizumab), used a non -inferiority margin of 5 letters in BCVA. 
Recently, controlled phase 3  clinical trials studying nAMD (HARBOR study [ Ho, 2014 ] and 
HAWK and HARRIER study [ Dugel, 2019 ]) were based on a reduced margin of 4  letters.  
Null and Alternative Hypotheses : 
The primary family of hypotheses (null vs. alternative) are stated as below.  
H10: μ1 ≤ μ 0 – 4 vs. H 11:  μ 1 > μ 0 – 4 (ie, HDq12 vs. 2q8)  
H30: μ2 ≤ μ 0 – 4 vs. H 31:  μ 2 > μ 0 – 4 (ie, HDq16 vs. 2q8)  
where μ 0, μ1, μ2, are the mean change from baseline in BCVA at week 48 for 2q8, HDq 12, and 
HDq16, respectively.   
In addition, the HDq12 and HDq16 treatment groups will be tested for non -inferiority against the 
control group of 2q8 with respect to the following key secondary endpoints.  The hypotheses (null 
vs. alternative) are, respecti vely, stated as below.  
1. Change from baseline in BCVA at week 60 (non -inferiority) (included as part of the 
primary family of hypotheses only for the EP -SAP)

where μ 0, μ1, μ2, are the mean change from baseline in BCVA at week 60 for 2q8, HDq12, and 
HDq16, respectively.  The non -inferiority margin is set at 4 letters.  
2. Proportion of patients with a ≥2 step improvement in DRSS at week 48 ( non-inferiority)  
H50: p1 ≤ p 0 – 0.15 vs. H 51: p1 > p 0 – 0.15 (ie, HDq12 vs. 2q8)  
H60: p2 ≤ p 0 – 0.15 vs. H 61: p2 > p 0 – 0.15 (ie, HDq16 vs. 2q8)  
where p 0, p1, p2, are the proportion of patients with ≥2 step improvement in DRSS at week 48 
for 2q8, HDq12, and HDq16, respectively.  The non -inferiority margin is set at 15%.  
The change from baseline in BCVA at week 48 and week 60 (for the EP -SAP) will also be tested 
for superiority to compare the HDq12 and HDq16 treatment groups against the control group of 
2q8.  
3. Change from baseline in BCVA at week 48 (superiority)  
H70: μ1 ≤ μ 0 vs. H 71:  μ 1 > μ 0 (ie, HDq12 vs. 2q8)  
H90: μ2 ≤ μ 0 vs. H 91:  μ 2 > μ 0 (ie, HDq16 vs. 2q8)  
where μ 0, μ1, μ2, are the mean change from baseline in BCVA at week 48 for 2q8, HDq12, and 
HDq16, respectively.   
4.  Change from baseline in BCVA at week 60 (superiority) (included only for the EP -SAP)  
H80: μ1 ≤ μ 0 vs. H 81: μ1 > μ 0 (ie, HDq12 vs. 2q8)  
H100: μ2 ≤ μ 0 vs. H 10_1: μ2 > μ 0 (ie, HDq16 vs. 2q8)  
where μ 0, μ1, μ2, are the mean change from baseline in BCVA at week 60 for 2q8, HDq12, and 
HDq16, respectively.   
11.2. Justification of Sample Size  
The sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint, the change from base line in BCVA 
at week 48 in 2 pairwise comparisons: (1) HDq12 vs. 2q8; (2) HDq16 vs. 2q8. The non -inferiority 
margin is defined to be 4 letters.  
Under the original testing strategy (prior to Amendment 4), assuming a standard deviation of 9.07 
letters for e ach treatment group ( Brown, 2015 ), a sample size of 129 patients per group will provide 
90% power using a two -sample t -test to demonstrate non -inferiority with one -sided alpha=0.0125 
(=0.025/2) for each comparison. The overa ll family -wise type I error rate of 0.025 (one -sided) will 
be preserved. Allowing for a dropout rate of 19%, 160 patients per group will be required to 
provide 90% power for each pairwise comparison. However, the sample size in the HDq12 group 
has been dou bled to meet regulatory requirements for the safety database. This results in a total of 
640 patients for 3  groups (160, 160, and 320 patients for groups 2q8, HDq16, and HDq12, 
respectively). Therefore, with these sample sizes, the power for the pairwise c omparisons will be: 
90% for HDq16 vs. 2q8, and approximately 97% for HDq12 vs. 2q8. The power to reject each of

Sample size/power calculations were performed usin g East 6 software.  
However, under the current hierarchical testing procedure, using the same assumptions as 
indicated above, a total sample size of 640 patients for 3 groups provides 98%  power for rejecting 
the null hypothesis H 10, and subsequently 92% power for rejecting the null hypothesis H 30, for the 
primary endpoint assessing non -inferiority, with a 1 -sided t -test at significance level of 0.025.

The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized patients  who r eceived at least 1 dose of study 
drug.   Analysis of the FAS will be done according to the treatment assigned to the patient at 
baseline (as randomized).  All efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the FAS.  The FAS will 
be used for primary analysis (statistical evaluation of non -inferiority) and the analysis of key 
secondary hypotheses.  
The per protocol set (PPS) includes all patients in the FAS who had a baseline and at least 1 post -
baseline assessment of BCVA, and do not have any relevant important protocol violations that 
affect the primary efficacy endpoint.  Treatment assignment is based on the treatment received (as 
treated). The final determination on the exclusion of patients from the PPS will be made on the 
masked data prior to the f irst database lock. The PPS will be used for supplementary analyses of 
change from baseline in BCVA (non -inferiority only) at week 48 (primary endpoint) and week  60 
(key secondary endpoint, under the EP -SAP).  
11.3.2.  Safety Analysis Set  
The safety analysis set (SA F) includes all randomized patients who received any study treatment; 
it is based on the treatment received (as treated).  Treatment compliance/administration and all 
clinical safety variables will be analyzed using the SAF.  The safety analysis will be pe rformed on 
the observed safety data.  
11.3.3.  Pharmacokinetic Analysis Sets  
The PK analysis population includes all patients who received any study drug and who had at least 
1 non -missing result following the first dose of study drug.  Patients will be analyzed bas ed on 
actual treatment received.  
11.3.4.  Immunogenicity Analysis Sets  
The ADA analysis set includes all patients who received study drug and had at least 1 non -missing 
result in the ADA assay following the first study dose.  Samples positive in the ADA assay will be 
analyzed in the NAb assay.  
The NAb analysis set includes all patients who received any study drug and who are negative in 
the ADA assay or with at least 1 non -missing result in the NAb assay.  Patients who are ADA 
negative are set to negative in the NAb  analysis set.

of patients reflected in the calculation (n), mean, standard deviation, Q1, median, Q3, minimum, 
and maximum.  
For catego rical or ordinal data, frequencies and percentages will be displayed for each category.  
Subgroups will be defined by key baseline factors (ie, demographics, disease characteristics, and 
medical history).  Subgroup analyses will be performed on efficacy and  safety endpoints.  Details 
will be described in the SAPs.  
All statistical analyses will be performed using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS), version 9.4 or 
higher.

 CONFIDENTIAL  The est imand is specified through the following definitions of population, variable, treatment 
condition, intercurrent events, and population -level summary:  
• Population: Defined by the inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Variable: Change from baseline to week 48 in BCVA  
• Treatment condition:  HD aflibercept administered every 12 weeks (HDq12) after 
3 initial monthly injections or every 16 weeks (HDq16) after 3 initial monthly 
injections versus aflibercept 2 mg administered every 8 weeks (2q8) after 5 initial 
monthly injec tions; dose regimen may be modified as detailed in Section  6.1.  For 
primary analysis, data for patients will be analyzed according to their randomized  
treatment group regardless of dose regimen modifications.  
• Intercurrent events: Premature discontinuation from treatment;  
• shortening /extension of the interval (DRM / rescue regimen) will not be considered 
an intercurrent event but as part of the randomized treatment regimen.

to week 48 in BCVA between HDq12 and 2q8 (and HDq16 and 2q8) resulting from a 
mixed -model for repeated measurements (MMRM).  
11.4.3.1.  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
Primary Efficacy Analysis:  
The primary efficacy analysis will be a multiple -comparison between the following 2 comparative 
arms: 1) HDq12 vs. 2q8; and 2) HDq16 vs. 2q8.  The primary efficacy variable (change in BCVA 
from baseline to week 48) will be analyzed using FAS with an MMRM analysis model.  The model 
is specified below and includes baseline BCVA as a covariate, treatment group, baseline CRT 
category, prior DME treatment, geographical region and visit as fixed effects, and interaction terms 
for treatment by visit and baseline BCVA by visit.  A Kenward -Roger approximation will be used 
for the denominator degrees of freedom. More details (including the handling of missing data as 
well as the missing at random assumption) will be in the SAP .

for example, as (𝛽𝑡1+𝛽𝑡1 * 𝑊𝑒𝑒𝑘  48)−(𝛽𝑡2+𝛽𝑡2 * 𝑊𝑒𝑒𝑘  48). 
A supplementary analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted using the MMRM model 
using the PPS .   
Superiority testing for change from baseline in BCVA at week 48 will be performed as described 
in Section  11.1  and placed in hierarchy as described in Section  11.4.4 . Further details will be 
described in the SAP.  
11.4.3.2.  Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
Analysis for Key Secondary Endpoints:  
The key secondary endpoint of change from baseline in BCVA at week 60 (EP -SAP only) will be 
analyzed with a model matching th e one for the primary endpoint.  The other key secondary 
efficacy endpoint (proportion of patients with ≥2 step improvement in DRSS at week 48) will be 
analyzed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) method, stratified by baseline CRT, prior 
DME treatment , and geographical region as specified for the primary endpoint.  The key secondary 
hypotheses for non -inferiority (see Section  11.1) will be tested according to the multiplicity 
adjustment method specified in Section  11.4.4 .  In addition, two -sided 95% confidence intervals 
will be reported.  
Superiority testing for the change from baseline in BCVA at week 60 will be performed as 
described in Section  11.1 and placed in hierarchy as described in  Section  11.4.4 . Further details 
will be described in the SAP.  
Analysi s for Additional Secondary and Exploratory Endpoints:  
All additional efficacy variables (see Section  4.1.3  and Section  4.1.4 ) will be analyzed 
descriptively at each scheduled visit from baseline to week 48, week 60, week 96,  
  These descriptive analyses may include statistical tests (with nominal p -
values) for the efficacy variables and two -sided 95% confidence intervals, in the same way as 
described for the primary and secondary efficacy variable analyses (see Section  11.4.3.1  and 
Section  11.4.3.2 ).  Time -to-event variables wil l be analyzed using the Kaplan -Meier method.  No 
multiplicity adjustments will be made for the additional efficacy analyses.  Further details will be 
described in the SAP.  
11.4.4.  Control of Multiplicity  
The overall family -wise type 1 error will be controlled at 0 .025 one -sided level for testing the 
primary and key secondary endpoints. Adjustment for multiple comparisons in the primary and 
key secondary endpoints will be made with the hierarchical testing procedure. This approach 
allows the confirmatory testing of a hypothesis at the full alpha level of 0.025 after successful 
rejection of the hypotheses which are ranked higher in the hierarchy. The testing hypotheses will 
be tested in the order as specified in Table  5 for G -SAP and EP -SAP, respectively.

 CONFIDENTIAL  13. ETHICAL AND REGULATO RY CONSIDERATIONS   
13.1. Good Clinical Practice Statement  
It is the responsibility of both the sponsor and the investigator(s) to ensure  that this clinical study 
will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration 
of Helsinki, and that are consistent with the ICH guidelines for GCP and applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
13.2. Informed Consent  
The principles of informed consent are described in ICH guidelines for GCP.  
The ICF used by the investigator must be reviewed and approved by the sponsor prior to 
submission to the appropriate IRB/EC.  A copy of the IRB/EC -approved ICF and documentation 
of approval must be provided to the sponsor before study drug will be shipped to the study site.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee (if acceptable by local regulations) to obtain 
written informed consent from each patient prior to his/her  participation in the study and after the 
aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study have been explained to the patient in 
language that he/she can understand.  The ICF should be signed and dated by the patient and by 
the investigator or  authorized designee who reviewed the ICF with the patient.   
• Patients who can write but cannot read will have the ICF read to them before signing 
and dating the ICF.  
• Patients who can understand but who can neither write nor read will have the ICF 
read to them in the presence of an impartial witness, who will sign and date the ICF to 
confirm that informed consent was given.  
The original ICF must be retained by the investigator as part of the patient’s study record, and a 
copy of the signed ICF must be given  to the patient.  
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, or if there 
are significant changes to the study procedures, the ICF must be reviewed and updated 
appropriately.  All study patients must be informed of the new information and provide their 
written consent if they wish to continue in the study.  The original, signed revised ICF must be 
maintained in the patient’s study record and a copy must be given to the patient.  
13.2.1.   
 
 
13.3. Patients Confidentiality and Data Protection  
The investigator must take all appropriate measures to ensure that the anony mity of each study 
patient will be maintained.  Patients should be identified by a patient identification number only,

Version 8 17Novemberl2021  7 1. BACKGROUND 
1.1 Disease  Background 
Adult soft tissue sarcomas (STS) constitute a wide heterogeneous group of very rare tumors, both 
in terms of histology and biological and clinical behavior. In contrast to major advances in the 
biological understanding of these heterogeneous subtypes, forward progress in the systemic 
treatment of sarcoma has been painstakingly slow. The prognosis of patients with metastatic or recurrent disease is poor and most of them will die from tumor progression. Taking into account differences in histology subtype, anatomic location of disease and age at disease onset, the overall median survival for patients with metastatic STS is approximately one year and only about 10% of these patients are alive at five years
1.  
Control of localized disease is, therefore, of prime importance as evidenced by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network’s (NCCN) current treatment guidelines
2. Pisters et al 
demonstrated that histologic grade, depth of location, and positive surgical margins are key determinants of STS recurrence.
3 However, patients typically present late with local tumor 
extensions into critical adjacent structures, making complete surgical resection with uninvolved margin s difficult. Preoperative radiotherapy has been shown to significantly improve local disease 
control, functional outcomes and survival in patients with locally advanced STS.

1.2 Ascorba te as an anti- tumor  agent 
Ascorbate (ascorbic acid, vitamin C, AscH) is one of the early unorthodox therapies for cancer, based on two unsupported hypotheses. McCormick postulated that ascorbate protects against cancer by increasing collagen synthesis ,
7,8 while Cameron hypothesized that ascorbate could have 
anti-cancer action by inhibiting hyaluronidase and thereby prevent cancer spread.9 These 
hypotheses were subsequently promoted by Cameron and Pauling.10,11 Cameron and Campbell 
initially published case reports of 50 patients; some seemed to have benefited from high dose ascorbate.
12 Cameron and Pauling then published results of 100 patients with terminal cancer that 
were given intravenous ascorbate .13 The ascorbate- treated patients were compared to 1000 
retrospective controls with similar disease. Patients who received ascorbate survived on average 300 days longer than controls .
11,13 A prospective study was then conducted that randomized 
patients to ascorbate treatment or palliative therapy. Treated patients had a median sur vival of 343 
days vs. 180 days  for controls .14 Smaller studies have also reported benefits of ascorbate.15,16 
To test “definitively” whether ascorbate was effective, Moertel conducted two randomized placebo -controlled studies randomized to oral  ascorbate; neither study showed benefit .
17,18 
Subsequently, ascorbate therapy  was considered ineffective . However, it was not recognized until 
approximately 15 years later that oral and intravenous ascorbate have strikingly different pharmacokinetics .
19,20 This difference in the administr ation route is key. Cameron gave patients 
ascorbate intravenously as well as orally, while Moertel’s patients received only oral  ascorbate. 
Thus, the issue of asc orbate in cancer treatment needed  to be re- examined.   
The evidence for use of ascorbate in cancer treatment falls into two categories: clinical data on dose concentration relationships and laboratory data describing potential cell toxicity with high concentrations of ascorbate in vitro . Clinical data show that when ascorbate is given orally, fasting 
plasma concentrations are tightly controlled at < 100 µ M.
21 As doses exceed 200 mg, absorption 
decreases, urine excretion increases and ascorbate bioavailability is reduced .19,21 In contrast, when 
1.25 grams of ascorbate are administered intravenously, concentrations as high as 1 mM are 
Version 8 17Novemberl2021  8 achieved. Some clinicians have infused more than 10 grams of ascorbate in cancer patients and 
achieved plasma concentrations of 1 to 5 mM .22 Thus, it is clear that intravenous administration of 
ascorbate can yield very high plasma levels, while oral treatment does not.  
Pharmacologic ascorbate concentrations have been shown to selectively kill many  cancer cell 
types. Chen et al . measured cell death in 10 cancer and 4 normal cell types using 1 -hour exposures 
to pharmacological ascorbate.23 Normal cells were unaffected by 20 mM ascorbate whereas 5 
cancer cell lines had EC 50 values of < 4 mM, a concentration achievable by intravenous 
administration. In addition, cell death was independent of metal chelators, but  dependent on 
formation of H 2O2.24 H2O2 generation was dependent on ascorbate concentration, incubation 
time; [H 2O2] displayed a linear increase with [ AscH] and it increased as a quadratic function of 
ascorbate radical, ascorbate being an electron donor to O 2 to form  superoxide and, eventually, 
H2O2.  
When ascorbate is infused intravenously the resulting pharmacologic concentration will distribute 
rapidl y into the extracellular water space.25 In vivo , Chen and colleagues demonstrated that 
intravenous injection of ascorbate (0.25- 0.5 mg/g body weight) increased baseline concentrations 
of ascorbate in the blood and extracellular fluid to > 8 mM a s well as increased formation of 
H2O2.26 More recent studies have demonstrated that intraperitoneal doses of 4 g/kg ascorbate 
resulted in blood concentrations of 40 mM; tumor extracellular fluid increased to peaks of 20 mM 
for up to 3 hours .21 Our data demonstrate that pharmacologic doses of ascorbate are cytotoxic to 
sarcoma cell lines and that it enhances radiation therapy  sensitivity in vitro  (Figure 1) . 
Additionally, we also showed that intraperitoneal administration of high dose ascorbate in 
combination with radiation inhibits orthotopic sarcoma growth and decreases tumor size in mice 
without causing an associated toxicity i n vivo  (Figure 2) . Combined, these studies provide a 
foundation for pursuing pharmacologic ascorbate as a prooxidant agent in cancer therapy and 
specifically in sarcoma.27 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
Figure 1  Demonstrates  that sarcoma cell 
lines,  fibrosarcoma (HT1080) and synovial 
sarcoma (SW -872), are sensitive to 
increasing doses of pharmacological 
ascorbate. Cells were treated with increasing doses of ascorbate for 1 hour followed by clonogenic cell survival analysis.  
Version 8 17Novemberl2021  9  
Ascorbate -mediated cell death has been shown to be due to H 2O2 generation, via ascorbate radical 
formation, with ascorbate as the electron donor .23,24,26 When ascorbate is infused intravenously the 
resulting pharmacologic concentration distributes rapidly in the extracellular water space.26 Thus, 
pharmacologic ascorbate concentrations in media, as a surrogate for extracellular fluid, should 
generate ascorbate radical and H 2O2. In contrast, the same pharmacologic ascorbate 
concentrations in whole blood generate little detectable ascorbate radical and no detectable H
2O2.18 This can be accounted for by efficient and redundant H 2O2 catabolic pathways in whole 
blood relative to those in media or extracellular fluid. Thus, ascorbic acid administered intravenously in pharmacologic concentrations may serve as a pro -drug for H
2O2 delivery to the 
extracellular milieu, but without H 2O2 accumulation in blood.  
1.3 Clinical Trial Data  
In a Phase I trial of intravenous ascorbic acid in patients with advanced malignancy the high-dose intravenous ascorbic acid was well tolerated when administered to patients. A dverse events and 
toxicity were minimal at all dose levels.  Ascorbic acid concentrations reached up to 25 mmol/L in 
patients who received ascorbic acid of 1.5 g/kg. Of the 24 patients in the study, only 4 recorded minor adverse events including headache, dizziness and diarrhea.
28  In another phase I trial using 
pharmacological ascorbate concurrently with gemcitabine in patients with locally advanced and 
Figure 2  Pharmacological ascorbate 
selectively sensitizes fibrosarcoma tumors to radiation in an orthotopic murine xenograft model. An orthotopic fibrosarcoma model was utilized by injecting  1×106 HT-1080 cells into the 
dermis of the right rear flank of athymic nude female mice. Once tumors were established, therapy was initiated with daily ascorbate (4 g kg−1 or sodium chloride control; IP) in combination with 12 Gy IR in 2 fractions (days 2 and 4) (A) Tumor volume measurements (points +/- error) fitted with a logistical regression (line) for mice treated with daily ascorbate in combination with radiation (B) Overall survival in mice treated with ascorbate in combination with radiation.

Version 8 17Novemberl2021  10 metastatic pancreatic cancer conducted at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, 9 patients 
received treatment. Individ ual doses between 50 to 125 g per infusion were given for maintenance 
of 350 mg/dL  level in plasma. 75- g dose yielded peak plasma  levels ranging between 320 and 630 
mg/dL. No dose limiting toxicities or serious adverse events were reported.29  
A phase I study of adding ascorbate to standard therapy in glioblastomas and NSCLC was initiated in 2013.
30 Subjects were assigned to high -dose ascorbate dose cohorts for the concomitant portion 
of therapy. Dose cohorts ranged from 15g to 87.5g. During the adjuvant phase, subjects underwent interpatient dose escalation to achieve a targeted plasma ascorbate level o f 350 mg/dL. Subjects 
received high -dose ascorbate during the adjuvant phase for up to 6 cycles. To date, 5 subjects have 
been enrolled in the recommended phase 2 dose of 87.5g. Treatment was well -tolerated with minimal 
adverse events. No subject experienc ed a grade 3 or greater hematologic or non -hematologic 
toxicity. The only adverse events associated with ascorbate were grade 1 dry mouth, grade 1 chills, and grade 2 hypertension. Dry mouth is transient and ends shortly after infusion. Grade 1 chills are infusion related, most likely due to the volume of fluid infused. Grade 2 hypertension occurs in some subjects during infusion, again most likely due to the volume of fluid infused.

1.4 Radiation Therapy in Sarcoma 
The ben efits of combination therapy with radiation and surgery in significantly improving local 
control in STS patients are well documented. Preoperative radiotherapy has been shown to significantly improve local disease control, functional outcomes and survival in patients with locally advanced STS
4-6. Recent review of literature indicates that about 10% of patients will have 
≥ 95% tumor necrosis, and about 25% will achieve ≥ 80% tumor necros is following preoperative 
radiation therapy alone.31,32  Further review indicates that only those patients who achieve ≥ 95% 
tumor necrosis with preoperative radiation have improved local and distant control as well as overall survival.
32 Despite its reported benefits, radiotherapy is associated with a high rate of 
complications and significant functional morbidity. O’Sullivan et al compared preoperative versus postoperative external beam radiation (EBRT) for resectable extremity STS.  Long term follow up 
revealed no statistical difference in local control and cause specific survival, however, preoperative radiotherapy was associated with a significantly higher rate  of acute wound complications (35% 
vs. 17%, p = 0.01) and a lower rate of late Grade 2– 4 fibrosis (32% vs. 48%, p = 0.07).
33,34 Multiple 
retrospective reviews have similarly found high rates of acute wound complications in sarcoma patients ranging from 25% to 44%.
35-38 These reported high rates of acute and late toxicities 
support the need for additional research to improve the safety profile of neoadjuvant radiotherapy.  
In addition, there is need to improve efficacy of the radiation treatments to achieve higher rates of tumor necrosis, and, to ensure resection of the tumor with clear margins for successful organ preserving treatment of sarcoma.

5. TREATMENT PLAN AND STUDY SCHEMA 
5.1 Study Design  
This is a single -arm open -label phase Ib/II clinical study assessing the efficacy of concurrent high 
dose ascorbate in combination with radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced, resectable, high grade sarcomas, as measured by pathological response rates. Patients will be treated with three 
times weekly IV ascorbate concurrently with radiation therapy . Surgery will be performed 4 -6 
weeks from the end of radiation therapy to allow for resolution of acute toxicities per current standard of care.  
5.2 Phase I b 
The phase Ib portion of this study is to ensure the safety and tolerability of high dose ascorbate in 
combination with EBRT as assessed by incidence of dose -limiting toxicities (DLT). Although this 
combination has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in GBM, this combi nation has not been 
studied in sarcoma patients.  EBRT will be given at the standard dose for resectable soft tissue 
sarcomas according to the NCCN sarcoma guidelines.
2 Patients will receive 50 Gy over 25 fractions 
for extremity and trunk sarcomas or 45 – 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions for retroperitoneal sarcomas, during 
which time they will be receiving three times a week IV high dose ascorbate. IV ascorbate infusions will be continued until the end of radiation therapy. Surgery will be performed 4- 6 weeks from the 
end of radiation to allow for adequate tissue healing and resolution of acute toxicities . 
Ascorbate will be dosed at an initial dose of 75gm IV three times a week concurrently with radiation therapy provided patient tolerated the test dose of ascorbate  during screening without any 
reactions. Initially 3 patients will be entered at the Dose 0 for ascorbate and be monitored at this three times a week dose until surgery when safety issues will be addressed. Otherwise, ascorbate dose will be deescalated and  dose - 1 will be explored as outlined. For this protocol DLT will be 
defined as an attributed adverse event (definite, probable or possible) that meets the criteria (Section 6.3).

5.3 Phase 2  
The phase 2 part of the study will provide an estimate of the relative treatment effect of 
pharmacological ascorbate in combination with preoperative EBRT in subjects with locally advanced, resectable,  ext remity or retroperitoneal  high grade sarcomas, as measured by 
pathological response rates.    
As above, patients will receive the first dose of pharmacological ascorbate intravenously on day 1 
of week 1 provided no reactions are seen to the test dose. This  will be followed by 3 times a week 
dosing (= 15 doses total)  at Dose 0 until completion of EBRT. Standard doses of radiation for 
resectable soft tissue sarcomas according to the NCCN sarcoma guidelines will be administered.

Patients will receive preoperative radiation at a dose of 50 Gy over 25 fractions  for extremity and 
trunk sarcoma or 45 to 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions for retroperitoneal sarcomas starting on week 1 day 
1. Subjects should be followed either by clinic visit or phone contact every 12 weeks  (+/- 4 weeks)  
for approximately 24 months after the end of the treatment phase, at which time the initial survival data and disease recurrence will be assessed. Details as per study calendar  (Section 10).

5.5 Post-consent Screening Procedures  
If subjects fail the G6PD or test doses of ascorbate, they are considered a screen failure.  
• G6PD test (off- site test, so draw immediately). If subject has a prior G6PD test, this can 
be used as G6PD levels do not fluctuate (i.e., there is no window for this test). 
• One test dose of 15g of ascorbate.  A p hysician must review the patient's medication list 
against the list of medications prohibited on this trial prior to the test dose of ascorbate. 
5.6 Concomitant Ascorbate (High- dose Ascorbic Acid) Infusions  
5.6.1 Participant dose . All patients will receive a standard ascorbate dose of 75 gm given over 
120 minutes 
5.6.2 Administration . Based on subject tolerance; infusion rate should not exceed 500 mL/hour 
without consulting with physician. Recommended infusions times are as follows (Table 1) 
but may be adjusted for subject comfort. Changes in infusion rates should be rec orded.  
5.6.3 Initiation . Start the week prior to chemoradiation with one 15-g infusion. This is the test 
dose. 75 gm dosing begins week 1 of radiation therapy. If the participant fails the 15g test dose it is not considered dose limiting toxicity. 
5.6.4 Schedule . Scheduled three times weekly during chemoradiation;.  
5.6.5 Duration. Subjects will continue with therapy until the end of standard radiation therapy or if any criteria of removal are met (Section 5.7)

Version 8 17Novemberl2021  18 5.7 Radiation therapy  
External beam radiation therapy will be given at the standard dose for resectable soft tissue 
sarcomas according to the NCCN sarcoma guidelines.2 Patients with extremity and trunk STS will 
receive 50 Gy over 25 fractions  and those with retroperitoneal STS will receive 45 to 50.4 Gy in 
28 fractions, during which time they will be receiving three times weekly IV ascorbate until the end of radiation therapy. Surgery will be performed 4- 6 weeks from the end of radiation to allow 
for adequate tissue healing and resolution of acute toxicities. 
Radiation therapy for this protocol is as per currently used standard pre -operative radiation therapy at 
the University of Iowa even for non- protocol patients. Selected guidelines from previously  conducted 
Radiation Therapy Oncology Groups (RTOG) studies are briefly summarized for this protocol.  
5.7.1 Preoperative Radiation therapy (3D -CRT or IMRT ). Either 3D conformal 
radiotherapy or intensity modulated radiation therapy may be utilized for adequate tumor 
coverage and to meet the dose constraints for critical normal structures. 
5.7.2 Radiation treatment planning scans and immobilization. CT scans with patient in a 
stable and comfortable position will be used for planning. MRI scans are optional and may be use d for co -registration with CT for tumor localization as needed. VacLoc or other 
immobilization devices can be used for immobilization.  
5.7.3 Target volumes and treatment field  (Extremity Sarcoma): 
Gross Target Volume (GTV):  Outline of the tumor as seen on CT or CT/MRI fusion.  
Clinical Target Volume (CTV) : CTV = GTV plus 4 cm margins in the proximal and distal  
directions. However, the margin can be reduced if it extends beyond the compartment, the field can be shortened to include the end of a compartment. The radial margin from the 
lesion should be 1 cm. It can be reduced in areas confined by the fascial barrier or bone or skin surface as per standard of care and treating radiation oncologist’s discretion. 
Planning Target Volume (PTV) : Include CTV and error of setup and organ motion. 
Typically  PTV includes CTV plus 0.5 - 1 cm in all dimensions. Final PTV is usually GTV 
+ 5 cm longitudinal and 2 cm radial, except where restricted by the compartment end, 
fascia, bone or skin surface as per standard of care and treating radiation oncologist’s discretion. 
Use of bolus on the skin surfaces is optional as needed. Where applicable biopsy scars 
should be bolused with appropriate thickness specific to the energy of the photon beam. 
5.7.4 Target volumes and treatment field (Retroperitoneal/Trunk Sarcoma):  
Gross Target Volume (GTV):  Outline of the tumor as seen on CT or CT/MRI fusion. 
Clinical Target Volume (CTV):  4D-CT imaging should be performed for tumors above 
the iliac brim to assess for possible tumor motion associated with respiration.   The CTV is 
generated by expanding the different respiratory phases GTV (ITV) by 1.5 cm symmetrically.   The margin can be reduced if it extends beyond the retroperitoneal 
compartment into bone, kidney, or l iver.  If tumor extends through inguinal canal, an 
additional 3cm can be added distally as per standard of care and treating radiation oncologist’s discretion. 
  
Version 8 17Novemberl2021  19 Planning Target Volume (PTV):  Include CTV and error of setup and organ motion. PTV 
expansions are typically CTV plus 0.5 - 1 cm in all dimensions.   Final PTV is typically 
ITV + 2 cm symmetrically as confined to the retroperitoneal compartment as per standard 
of care and treating radiat ion oncologist’s discretion.   
5.7.5 Dose Specifications : 
A dose of 50 Gy in 25 daily fractions for extremity STS and 45 to 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions for retroperitoneal STS will be prescribed to the planning target volume (PTV) using linear accelerator and megavoltage photon beams with energies of 6MV or greater.  
For retroperitoneal/intra -abdominal sarcomas, a dose -painted simultaneous integrated 
boost (SIB) to total dose of 57.5 Gy in 25 fractions is allowed in select cases. A 
postoperative EBRT boost is discouraged. Prescribed dose should cover > 90% of the PTV. More than 95% of the PTV should receive 
> 95% of the prescribed dose. No more than 20% of the PTV will receive ≥ 110% prescription dose. 
5.7.6 Precautions and Dose Constraints for critical structures : 
Radiation dose to normal tissues should be kept within the accepted normal tissue 
tolerances. Every effort should be made to: 
a) Avoid treating the full circumference of an extremity;  
b) Avoid treating anus, urogenital tract, perineum and genitalia; if the tumor is close to 
these structures, typically less than 50% volume of the anus and vulva should receive 30 Gy; less than 50% volume of the testis should receive 3 Gy, if the patient prefers to reserve fertility;  
c) Avoid treating the lung, through use of appropriate shielding and treatment planning; less than 20% of the lungs should receive 20 Gy (V20); 
d) Avoid dose maximums in areas where surgical scars will be placed; this may require reviewing treatment plans with the surgeon; 
e) If possible, avoid treating skin over areas commonly traumatized to full dose (e.g., the elbow, knee, shin, femoral neck). 
f) If possible, less than 50% of any joints (including shoulder, elbow and knee) should receive 50 Gy.  
g) Less than 50% of kidney volumes should receive 18 Gy.  
h) No more than 50% of normal weight -bearing bone within the radiation field should 
receive 50 Gy except when the tumor invades the bone or when there is circumferential involvement of the tumor more than a quarter of the bone or when the bone will be resected in a subsequ ent surgical resection after radiation.  
For any other normal tissue structures, no radiation dose more than the established TD5/5 limit should be given.  
5.7.7 Image Guidance and Verification Devices  
Portal films or conebeam CT images should be used for target localization and alignment.  
Daily cone beam CT will be preferred and dose from daily cone beam should be included 
Version 8 17Novemberl2021  20 in the final dosimetry.  
  
Version 8 17Novemberl2021  21 5.7.8 Simultaneous Integrated Boost 
A simultaneous integrated boost to a total dose of 57.5 Gy in 25 fractions is allowed f or 
patients in whom the surgeon feels a margin negative resection will be difficult to 
achieve. The boost volume is defined as the high- risk retroperitoneal margin jointly 
identified by the surgeon and treating radiation oncologist. In this scenario, no further postoperative boost is allowed.  
5.7.9 Postoperative Radiotherapy Boost  
An External Beam or Brachytherapy boost can be given at the discretion of the radiation 
oncologist . If deemed necessary , the boost volume would include the positive tumor 
margin (residual tumor) plus a margin of 1 cm . Boost treatment should be delivered  within 
2 weeks following surgery or after adequate wound healing has occurred. 
The target volume for postoperative radiotherapy will be the residual tumor bed as defined 
by the surgical and pathological findings.  
5.7.10 External Beam Radiotherapy 
Postoperative external beam boost dose is 16 Gy in 8 fractions (once a day)  for microscopic 
disease and 20 Gy in 10 fractions for gross residual disease providing normal tissue is 
spared (likely requires a biologic or synthetic tissue spacer).  
5.7.11 Anticipated Radiation Therapy Adverse Events  
Acute: Wound complications of any grade are expected to develop in about one third of 
patients. Other common radiation adverse events include: fatigue, regional  alopecia, 
diarrhea, skin erythema and desquamation within the treatment fields, and reduction in blood counts. 
Long- term: Common long- term treatment adverse events include: lymphedema of the 
extremity receiving radiation and surgery, subcutaneous fibrosis, and joint stiffness. Much less common radiation adverse events include bowel injury, osteoradionecrosis, and bony fracture in the radiation field. There also is a risk of secondary malignancy occurring in the irradiated field.  
5.8 General Concomitant Medica tion and Supportive Care Guidelines  
Patients should receive full supportive care, including transfusions of blood and blood products, antibiotics, etc., when appropriate. The reason(s) for treatment, dosage, and the dates of treatment should be recorded.  
Throughout the study, investigators may prescribe any concomitant medications or treatments 
deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care. All prescription and nonprescription concomitant medication administered up to 28 days prior to enrollment, on an ongoing basis at enrollment, as well as changes in such concomitant medication, and any new concomitant medication taken while the subject is on study, should be recorded up to 30 days after the last dose of ascorbate.  
5.8.1 Antiemetics . Use  Zofran (ondansetron) with caution as this medication may be less 
effective when used with ascorbate. Prefer alternative agents such as prochlorperazine  
5.8.2 Fluid intake.  Subjects will be encouraged to maintain adequate hydration to decrease the 
risk of nephrolithiasis. Those unable to maintain oral hydration should be considered for 
Version 8 17Novemberl2021  22 supplemental IV hydration per institutional care guidelines.  
5.8.3 For diabetics , be aware high -dose ascorbate can provide false results for finger- stick 
glucose readings. This effect is dose dependent but can last up to 6h post-infusion. 
Serum/plasma tests are not affected.39 
  
Version 8 17Novemberl2021  23 5.9 Criteria for removal from study  
Treatment with pharmacological ascorbate may be discontinued if any one  of the following criteria  
is met: 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or 
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for 
further treatment in the judgment of the investigator 
• Progressive disease as determined by the investigator 
• A female subject becomes pregnant or fails to use 2 highly effective methods of 
contraception (for those subjects who are able to conceive).  
• A female subject breast feeds while on study treatment.  
• A male subject fails to use a highly effective method of contraception  
5.10 Duration of Follow Up 
Post- operatively subjects should be followed either by clinic visit or phone contact every 12  ± 4 
weeks  for approximately 2 years  from  the end of enrollment, to assess for survival, and disease 
recurrence. Surveillance imaging  and clinical assessment to assess for disease recurrence will be 
as per NCCN guidelines. 
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS / DOSE LIMITING TOXICITIES  
6.1 Radiation Therapy 
6.1.1 Dose modification  - Radiation therapy dose will not be modified. 
6.1.2 Treatment delay  - Will only occur for reasons of safety due to intercurrent illness or 
medical conditions that in the judgment of the radiation oncologist forbid delivery of 
radiation therapy. 
6.1.3 Interruptions  or delays of greater than three days should be discussed with the study’s 
principal investigator and documented 
6.2 Ascorbate Therapy  
6.2.1 Dose reductions  – As per Table 1 (below) if there is a DL T (Section 5.6)

 • Initial dose for all = Ascorbate 75gm IV  
6.2.2 Test/retest . If an unexpected adverse event is observed, the treating physicians may 
withhold ascorbic acid for up to 2 calendar weeks to determine if the effect diminishes or 
resolves entirely. Considering the nature and severity of the event, if reasonable ascorbic acid should then be continued to determine if the event again presents. This will function as a test for causality.  
6.2.3 Dose delays . Due to holidays or inclement weather, doses may be delayed by up to one 
week  with physician and PI approval. Reason for treatment delay should be noted in the 
study chart.  
6.3 Dose Limiting Toxicities  
Definitions of dose- limiting toxicity:  
Toxicity will be evaluated according to CTCAE version 5.0. DLT will be defined as any of the following ascorbate related toxicity  or related to the combination of pharmacologic ascorbate and 
radiation therapy during treatment and up to 28 days after the first pharmacologic ascorbate 
infusion:  
• Infection grade 4  
• SAE per 21CFR312.21 with an attribution of possible, probable, or definite  to ascorbate  
• Grade 3 diarrhea or nausea/ vomiting despite maximal support 
• Any grade 3/4 or greater hematologic or non- hematologic toxicity  not explainable by 
another cause in the opinion of the principal investigator, with the exceptions of:  
o Expected radi ation related skin toxicity of any grade. 
o Brief (< 1 week) grade 3 fatigue.  
If unexpected DLT occurs, ascorbate administration should be delayed until the DLT has resolved 
to at least CTCAE version 5.0 grade 1  or baseline and future dose be reduced to dose  level -1 as 
per table 1 . If dosing is delayed by more than 4 weeks due to the occurrence of unexpected  adverse 
event or if a patient already dose reduced to level - 1 (62.5 gm/dose) experiences another DLT that 
is considered related to ascorbate, then the subject should be taken off study. 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS: LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
This study will also be monitored by internal oversight specialists at the University of Iowa. The 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan of the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center  provides standard 
operating procedures to monitor all clinical cancer trials at the UIHC. All investigator -initiated 
trials are automatically monitored by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). A detailed data and safety monitoring plan for this  study is provided (Appendix). This study has been 
assigned as a risk level 4  as it utilizes an investigator sponsored IND.  
  
Version 8 17Novemberl2021  25 7.1 Determination of R eporting R equirements  
The clinical research team is responsible for collecting and recording the research data. As these 
results are collected, all toxicities and adverse events will be identified and reported to the principal investigator (PI). The principal investigator  (PI) will determine  final relatio nship of the event to 
the investigational product (ascorbate) : 
• Grade 1 and 2 events do not require attributions assigned. 
• Grade 3 and higher adverse events require attribution assigned to ascorbate.  
Toxicity will be graded according to NCI’s Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE v5 ). The principal 
investigator will have final responsibi lity for determining the attribution of toxicity as it is related 
to the investigational product.  
7.2 Institutional Review Board reporting requirements  
Adverse events that meet criteria of both serious and attributed  (possible, probable, or definite) to 
the study agent. Thus: 
• Serious adverse events only  
• Attributable to ascorbate (i.e., drug related) 
• Report to the IRB via HawkIRB within 10 business days of event 
7.3 FDA reporting requirements [M.Milhem, sponsor]  
Adverse events meeting the criteria of serious, unexpected, and attributed  (possible, probable, or 
definite) to ascorbate must be reported by the sponsor or the sponsor’s appointed designee to the 
FDA:  
• Serious adverse events only  [21 CFR 312.32] 
• Attributable to ascorbate with a causal relationship  (possible, probable, or definite)  
• Unexpected, as defined by the FDA: “…not listed in the investigator brochure or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator or, if an 
investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current 
application, as amended .” 
To help the sponsor meet these reporting requirements, all serious adverse  events  that are 
unexpected and attributed to study drug must be reported to the sponsor within 1 business day. 
This coincides with SAE reporting requirements for the DSMC. 
7.4 Routine A dverse E vent Reporting Requirements to DSMC  
An adverse event (AE) is defin ed in the CTEP, NCI Guidelines  [2005] as “any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure  (attribution of 
unrelated, unlikely, possible, probably or definite).” 
Routine adverse events are captured in OnCore, the clinical trials management system, for review 
and assessment by the P.I., sponsor, medical monitor, and DSMC.  
  
Version 8 17Novemberl2021  26 7.5 Serious Adverse Event Reporting to DSMC  
For any experience or condition meet ing the definition of a serious adverse event (SAE ; 
21CFR312.32), from the first day of study treatment and typically continue through the 30 day 
follow-up period after treatment is discontinued.  
Investigators must report to the DSMC any SAE , regardless of attribution to study drug. SAEs 
must be reported via  an OnCore SAE Report within 1 business day of learning of the event.  
An adverse event is considered serious  if it results in ANY of the following outcomes:   
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse event  
• An adverse event that results in inpatient hospitalization OR prolongation of 
existing hospitalization for ≥ 24 hours  
• A persistent or significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. ( 21 
CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6 ). 
8. PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION – ASCORBIC ACID INJECTION, ASCOR L 
500® 
8.1 Availability  
IND 137968 allows  ascorbate to be obtained through McGuff P harmaceuticals (Santa Ana, 
CA). Their product Ascor L 500® is now a commercially available injection available in 
sterile single -use 50 mL vials containing 25 g of ascorbic acid (500 mg/mL).  
8.2 Compatibility  
Ascorbate is considered a CYP4503A4 inhibitor.40 Therefore close monitoring of subjects 
who may be concomitantly receiving CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indexes for toxicities is required. A table of CYP3A4 substrates, inhibitors, and inducers is provided in the Appendix. Ascorbate may decrease plasma/blood concentrations of substrates (Appendix B, tables 1, 2, and 3). Ascorbate may increase CYP3A4 induction (Appendix B, Table 4).  
8.3 Storage and Stability 
Unopened vials of are stable until the expiration date indicated on the package when stored 
between 2° – 8°C (36° –46°F). Protect from light and store in the carton until time of use.

9.2 Labile Iron Measurements using MRI Imaging  (optional) 
Pharmacological ascorbate’s mechanism of action is hypothesized to involve changes in labile iron 
pools within the tumor. The presence of labile iron and/or iron containing metalloproteins is necessary to oxidize ascorbate and eventually lead to the generation of hydrogen peroxide, thereby increasing tumor cell oxidative stress. In vitro laboratory studies demonstrate treating GBM and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with high doses of ascorbate increases labile iron 
pools.
30 Additionally, chelating (e.g., removing) iron from tissue culture media reduces 
pharmacological ascorbate toxicity to tumor cells.  
MRI imaging will be done only for extremity sarcoma subjects prior to ascorbate treatment as a pre-scan control (at diagnosis) and will be done at  60 minutes +/ - 30 minutes)and 4 hours post 
ascorbate treatment (in radiation oncology suite  during week 3) as it has been seen that ascorbate 
levels tend to peak between 1 and 2 hours after injection.
30 Imaging studies will be conducted on 
Version 8 17Novemberl2021  28 a GE 1.5T/3T MRI scanner using appropriate anatomical coils.  Images will be acquired using a 
T2* fast gradient -echo, multi -echo pulse sequence with short echo time (~6 ms) and repetition 
time ~25 ms which has shown to be beneficial in previous studies involving iron overload 
measurements in the liver and heart.41,42  Image analysis will initially be done using a region of 
interest approach in which the tumor region will be contoured and then analyzed using a mono -
exponential decay of the T2* relaxation time.  This image analysis has been shown by Positano, et. al  
42 to be clinically acceptable and more clinically relevant. Serum iron , transferrin saturation, 
total iron binding capacity and ferritin levels will be obtained to evaluate if they correlate with 
responses and T2* imaging findings.     
This series will be done at three time points – baseline (as part of simulation in radiation oncology 
suite or as part of diagnostic MRI if it is being done), week 3 and end of study (as part of diagnosis). 
The imaging in week 3, done in the radiation oncology suite, is centered around that day’s 
ascorbate infusion. Contrast is not allowed  for the se sequences  and will  not be ordered. The 
following MRI should be ordered to be completed on the same day: 
9.2.1 Contrast .  No contrast is to be used (oral or IV) 
9.2.2 Scheduling . The infusional T2* is scheduled in week 3. The other time points are at RT 
simulation and end of treatment study (diagnostic) 
9.2.3 Pre-infusion (week 3).  A pre -infusion T2* MR series will be obtained. This will contain 
both the T2* and also axial imaging for reference.  
9.2.4 Post-infusion (week 3).  30 to 90 minutes within the end-of-infusion, a second T2* / axial 
series w ill be obtained. This should be obtained prior to the day’s radiation therapy. 
9.2.5 4h post- infusion (week 3). The last T2* / axial series will be done approximately 4h 
after the end -of-infusion (± 60 minutes). 
9.3 Diffusion Weighted Imaging (optional) 
Addition of functional diffusion- weighted MRI (DW -MRI) to standard anatomic and postcontrast 
MRI greatly facilitates interpretation  of response to therapy43,44. After radiation therapy, new 
enhancement alone can be seen which may be a result of vascular disruption rather than histologic 
response. Hence should be interpreted carefully. Although currently not a standard clinical trial 
endpoint, DW-MRI appears to be a promising as a quick, noninvasive  tool showing excellent 
reproducibility for apparent diffusion coefficient measurements,  which reflect tumor cellularity 
and microarchitecture in STS . However, the relationship of these  MRI parameter changes with 
clinical outcomes has not yet been  validated . Hence we intend to evaluate this MRI sequence which 
is currently acquired routinely for imaging brain tumors and stroke. This sequence will be added 
to the planning MRI acquired in radiation oncology prior to starting radiation therapy treatment and will be compared to the DWI sequence acquired pre- operatively.  
9.4 Ascorbate levels  
Serum ascorbate levels will be drawn at screening, 30 mins post at week  1 day 1, as well as 30 
mins  post  week 3 Day 1 and 30 min post  last infusion in week  5. This is being done to ensure a 
target serum level of 20 mM is reached during treatment.  
9.5 Tumor tissue  
A part of the resected tumor  (1 x 1 inch)  specimen together with the surrounding normal tissue 
will be testing for immune markers such as CD4, CD8, T  regulatory cells. MDSCs and 
Version 8 17Novemberl2021  29 macrophages.  Flash frozen tissue will be subjected to T2 * imaging testing to determine labile iron 
concentrations in comparison to the surrounding normal tissue. Molecular testing including next 
generation testing may be performed on the paraffin embedded tissue specimens. Optional pre - 
treatment tumor biopsies will be take n from approximately 5 subjects total and immune markers 
will be compared between pre and post treatment tissue in the immunology lab.

10.3 Post-treatment Evaluations 
Following surgical resection of primary tumor, patients will be followed as per NCCN guidelines 
for approximately 2 years for survival data and disease recurrence.  
11. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT 
11.1 Pathologic Response  
4 to 6 weeks after the end of neoadjuvant therapy, patients will undergo resection of the treated tumor. The SOC pretreatment biopsy and all the resected tumor samples will be reviewed by the 
same pathologist.  
The percentage of post treatment tumor necrosis must be documented. The primary end point for 
this study is pathologic complete response (pCR), and is defined as ≥ 95% tumor necrosis following concurrent radiation therapy and ascorbate  
Treatment effect on the resected overlying skin tissue will be graded and recorded (to be done by 
the pathologist). This will be compared with historical controls.   
Additional immunohistochemical studies will be performed  as determined by the pathologist. 
11.2 Time to Disease progression (TTP)  
TTP is defined as the time from Enrollment until objective tumor progression including local and 
distant recurrences.  
11.3 Other Response Parameters  
The following response assessment guidelines may be amended during the course of the study if changes are made to the current RECIST Guidelines or if a new disease assessment tool becomes available.  
Version 8 17Novemberl2021  33 Response Measurement Criteria:   
Measurements of the tumor in its largest dimension should be obtained at baseline and at the end 
of the treatment phase, prior to surgical resection.  
Response criteria should be by RECIST v 1.1. 
• Complete response is the disappearance of all target lesions . 
• Partial response is a 30% decrease in the sum o f the longest dimensions of the target 
lesions, relative to baseline.  
• Progressive disease is an increase of 20% or more in the sum of the longest dimension of 
target lesions  
• Stable disease is a decrease in t he tumor size of < 30% or an increase of < 20%. 
• Antitumor response by pathologic assessment will be performed on the resected tumors. Pathologic assessment will be performed per institutional guidelines.  
• The percent of tumor necrosis and the percent of tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes will be 
documented. 
• Complete pathological response will be considered ≥ 95% pathologic tumor necrosis.  
Radiologic response will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca  45:228- 247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of 
the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in th e 
RECIST criteria.  
   
Version 8 17Novemberl2021  34 12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1 Phase Ib  
The primary objective of the Phase Ib portion of this study is to confirm the current standard dose 
of intravenous ascorbate, 75 gm, utilized in patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer also receiving concurrent chemo radiation is safe within this population of sarcoma patients being 
treated concurrently with pre -operative radiation. Up to six (6) patients will be recruited to the 
standard dose, 75 grams administered intravenously 3 times a week during radiation therapy (5 weeks ). If at most 1 out of 6 patients experience a DLT, the standard dose will be considered safe. 
If 2 or more patients experience a DLT,  the next cohort of patients will be assigned to dose level -
1. The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) will be defined as the highest dose level for which at 
most 1 out of 6 patients experience a DLT.   
12.2 Phase II 
The primary objective of the Phase II portion of this study is to evaluate the proportion of patients 
with pathologic tumor necrosis ≥95%. Previous literature indicates  approximately 10% of patients 
will achieve ≥95% tumor necrosis with pre -operative radiation therapy alone. A sample size of 25 
patients achieves 81% power to detect a difference of 20% (from 10% to 30%) using a one -sided 
binomial exact test. The target si gnificance level is 0.05 and the achieved level is 0.03. If 6 or more 
patients achieve ≥95% tumor necrosis, the treatment will be deemed worthy of further investigation. For secondary objectives, time to disease progression and overall survival will be 
estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method. Estimated survival probabilities will be plotted and 
medians reported, along with 95% confidence intervals. T o identify differences in wound 
complication and Grade 3 -4 dermatitis rates relative to historical controls , binomial point estimates 
and 95% exact confidence intervals will be reported. Mixed effects regression models will be used 
to estimate changes in labile iron and diffusion imaging sequences on MRI pre and post treatment.    
12.3 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
The Phas e I portion of this study is expected to require 6 evaluable patients (min 6, max 12). 
Patients treated in Phase Ib at the RP2D will also be included in the Phase II portion. Additional evaluable patients will be accrued for a total of 25 patients  treated at the RP2D. The anticipated 
accrual rate is 2 patients per month who would meet inclusion criteria.

Reporting and Monitoring Requirements:  
All institutional investigator initiated trials (IITs), regardless of assigned risk level are subject to 
routine DSMC monitoring activities which may include but are not limited to review of signed consent documents, eligibility and adverse event reporting.  
All institutional IITs have the following reporting requirements  as part of their DSMP:  
• Register all subjects in HCCC’s Clinical Trial Management System, OnCore  
• Document Adverse Events  
• Document protocol deviations  
• Provide an annual progress report to the DSMC via OnCore data export 
Selected monitoring strategy based on risk -level :

Version 8 17Novemberl2021  44 Study Safety Review 
An independent study monitor and/or the DSMC Chair (or designee), will review study data 
(provided by the PI/available in OnCore) and communicate with the PI at least biannually.  A copy of this communication will be forwarded to the DSMC and PRMC Chairs.   
Additional Reporting Requirements:  
- A scanned copy of the completed eligibility checklist, with screening information and PI signature, will be attached in OnCore for ongoing review by DSMC staff.  
- Serious adverse events will be entered directly into an OnCore SAE report by the research team.  OnCore will send an automatic notification to the DSMC Chair/acting Chair and staff for review.  
- The DSMC utilizes a risk -based monitoring approach.  The trial's research records will be 
monitored at minimum twice per year.  Monitoring may be done more frequently depending on the protocol, risks to subjects, reported serious/adverse events, patient population and accrual rate.   Records for a minimum of 25% of subjects will be monitored for t he entire 
study.    
Monitoring will involve the following: 
• review eligibility of patients accrued to the study,  
• check for the presence of a signed informed consent, 
• determine compliance with protocol’s study plan, 
• determine whether SAEs are being appropriately reported to internal and external 
regulatory agencies,  
• compare accuracy of data in the research record with the primary source documents, 
• review investigational drug processing and documentation, 
• assess cumul ative AE/SAE reports for trends and compare to study stopping rules. 
Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
For non- serious Adverse Events, documentation must begin from the time the subject signs the 
informed consent document and continue through the 30- day foll ow-up period after the last dose 
of study drug. 
Collected information should be recorded in the electronic/Case Report Forms (eCRF/CRF) for 
that subject. A description of the event, its severity or toxicity grade (according to 
NCI’s Common 
Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE) ), onset and resolved dates (if applicable), and the relationship to the 
study drug should be included. Documentation should occur in real time. The principal investigator has final responsibility for determining the attribution of the event as it is related to the study drug. 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
For any experience or condition that meets the definition of a serious adve rse event (SAE), 
recording of the event must begin after signing of the informed consent and continue through the 30 day follow-up period after treatment is discontinued.  
Investigators must report to the DSMC any serious adverse events (SAE), whether or not they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64). SAEs must be reported via an OnCore SAE Report within 24 hours of learning of the event.   
Version 8 17Novemberl2021  45 An adverse event is considered serious  if it results in ANY of the follo wing outcomes:   
1. Death  
2. A life -threatening adverse event  
3. An adverse event that results in inpatient hospitalization OR prolongation of existing 
hospitalization for ≥ 24 hours  
4. A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
5. A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6. Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 
21 CFR 
312.32 ; ICH E2A and ICH E6 ). 
 Study Stopping and Pausing Rules
 
The study will pause enrollment and stop treatment for all participants if any of the following events occur pending submission to Regulatory Agencies and review by the  DSMC and IRB who will determine if the study may resume:  
• Any event of treatment related death in a study subject 
 
FDA Reporting Requirements (for Sponsor -Investigators)  
It is the responsibilit y of the IND sponsor- investigator to comply with IND safety reporting as se t 
forth in the Code of Federal Regulations, Section  312.32 . This responsibilit y includes providing 
an annual I ND report to the  FDA.  
All IND safety reports must be submitted on Form 3500A  and be accompanied by Form 1571 . 
The type of report (initial or follow -up) should be checked in the respective boxes on Forms 3500A 
and 1571. See Instructions for completing Form 3500A.  Please note all instance of UIHC, 
location, and faculty / staff should be redacted from supporting documentation and the 3500A. 
The submission must be identified as: 
• “IND safety report” for 15 -day reports, or 
• “7-day IND safety report” for unexpect ed fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse 
reaction reports, or 
• “Follow-up IND safety report” for follow-up information. 
For detailed explanation of the above definitions, requirements, and procedures related to IND 
application safety reports and the responsibilities of IND applications sponsors with regard to such reporting, refer to 
Guidance for Industry and Investigators: Safety Reporting Requirements for 
INDs and BA/BE Studies (PDF - 227KB)  
In addition to comple ting appropria te patient de mographic and suspect medi cation  information, 
the report should include the f ollowing informa tion within the  Event Des cription (s ection  5) of th e 
MedWatch 3500A for m: 
• Treatment reg imen (dosing f requency, combination therapy) 
Version 8 17Novemberl2021  46 • Protocol des cription (and number , if assigned) 
• Description of event, sever ity, treatment, and outc ome, if known (grading the event per 
CTCAE)  
• Suppor tive labora tory results and diagnostics 
• Sponsor -Inve stigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adver se event to each 
investigational produc t and suspect medica tion 
Data Monitoring and Management  
Subject Registration  
All studies that undergo PRMC review and/or utilize HCCC Clinical Research Services (CRS) 
resources are required to register subjects in OnCore. Each subject registration includes the following: 
• The subject’s IRB approved (version date) consent form and the date of their consent.  
• Date of eligibility and eligibility status (eligible, not eligible)  
• On study date and subject’s disease site (and histology if applicable) 
• On treatment date (if applicable)  
All subject registration information is expected to be entered into OnCore within  2 (two) business 
days  after the subject’s study visit.  
Subject Data  
For HCCC investigator initiated trials, research staff are responsible for entering subject study data (data collection) into OnCore electronic case report forms (eCRFs). These eCRFs must be approved by the PI and statistician prior to study activation to ensure sufficient and necessary data acquisition. All information entered into eCRFs will be traceable to the source documents which are generally maintained in the subject’s file.  
eCRF data entry needs to be timely and should be entered into OnCore as soon as possible but no later than 14 (fourteen) business days  after the subject’s visit, including adverse events, tumor 
measurements, administration of study medication, concomitant medications, labs, and vitals. Physical exam assessments must be entered no later than 14 (fourteen) business days  following 
completion of the physician’s clinic note in the medical record.  
Timely data entry facilitates remote monitoring of data, allows the data to progress appropriately through the data cleaning process, and helps prevent a backlog of data queries. 
Forms Monitoring 
OnCore eCRF data are monitored on a routine basis (dependent on accrual) to ensure all data are entered completely, accurately, and within time requirements outlined above. The assigned DSMC monitor will coordinate and complete the data monitoring review. When the time comes to monitor 
a study (based on patient accrual and assigned risk level of trial) the monitor arranges for a selection of cases to be reviewed from among the subjects registered in OnCore.  As part of the forms monitoring process, the assigned monitor will issue queries via OnCore (linked to the eCRF) to resolve missing, incomplete, and/or incorrect information. A member of the research team is expected to respond to these monitoring queries within 14 (fourteen) business days .  
The monitoring process can often identify misunderstandings or deficiencies in the written, research protocol requirements earlier in the study process and thereby improve data quality and 
Version 8 17Novemberl2021  47 reduce rework.  
Final Reports 
A summary of each subject’s data record is continually available to the PI, research staff, and 
DSMC from OnCore’s Biostat Console. The availability of this information is a valuable tool for the preparation of final reports and manuscripts as well as ongoing deficiency reports.

III. Introd uction and Pu rpose 
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common  type of arthritis causing considerable disability across 
broad populations. The economic  burden of arthritis, specificall y osteoarthritis is en ormou s with 
an estimated cost of $60 billion in the United States and expected to increase to $100 billion by 
2020.1,2    The knee joint is the most common joint to develop OA and total knee arthroplasty 
(TKA)  is the most frequently performed joint arthro plasty procedure for this condition. 3,4   With  
an increase  in the prevalence of arthritis, obesity, and old age, a further  demand for TKA is 
projected to increase  substantial ly over the next few years . 5-9  In 2005, approximately 523,0 00 
TKAs w ere performed nationally. 10    The American A cademy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) and 
Kurtz  et al, 11  have provided projections for future demand of TKA. In 2002, the AAOS had 
suggested an annual replaceme nt load of 474,000 by the year 2030. In 2007, Kurtz  et al, 11 
described an annual demand of 3.5 million by 2030. Wh ile these projections vary widely,  both 
suggest a strong increa se in demand for TKA, prompting significant interest from surgeons, 
healthcare  institutions and ortho pedic device manufacturers  interested  to better understand 
the futu re technological and economic burden of TKA. 
 
Although, TKA has demonstrated effectiveness with  substanti ve and susta ined improvement in 
quality of life for individuals with  moderate to severe osteoarthritis, 12,13 functional performance 
in patients 1  year af ter TKA remains lower than  for healthy adults, with rep orts of an 18%  slower 
walkin g speed,  51% slower stair -climbing speed,  and deficits  of nearly 40% in  quadriceps 
strength.  14 Additionally, certain limitations in knee design system s require surgeons to accept 
compromises which ca n resu lt in su rgical in efficiencies  and ch allenges in seizing desired 
outcomes. 15-19  Patient  expectations and an ever emerging population with  active lifestyle also 
add a new requirement and need for innovative designs that bring advantages  over traditional 
implants. Personalized implants with  critical features of natural mov ement, contoured shape, 
and unique anatomic  and physiologic composition can address these  requirements. The current 
concepts in TKA warrant a personalized orthopedics initiati ve by offering a fin er ability in 
identifying  and precise ly addressi ng the unique needs of patien ts. It is thro ugh th is introduction 
of high fidelity  implants, morphologic desi gns and  intellig ent instr umentati on that each patie nt’s 
knee can be distinctively and accurately reconstructed, allowing for clinical outcomes to be 
better  optimized.  Furthermore,  such  personalized  systems  will  empower  the  surgeon  to 
advance performance by providing a leading design that efficie ntly accommodates  surgeons’ 
intrao perative needs with minimizing surgical trade-offs and  maximizing efficiency. 
 
To address these clinical c hallenges and methodologically address new implant characterist ics, a 
prospect ive, multi-center, longitudinal data collection mod el is being proposed. The objective of 
this study is to  determine clinical performance/ outcomes and implant survivorship for 
commerciall y available Persona® fixed  bearin g implants used in  primary total knee arthroplasty. 
 
 
IV. Study Objectives 
The objective of this study is to obtain clinical perfo rmance (outcomes) data and survi vorship for 
commerciall y available Persona fixed  bearin g knee  components implanted in primary t otal knee 
arthroplasty.     This  will  be  done  by  analysis  of  validated  outcome  measurement  tools, 
radiograph s and  adverse  event data.

 The a ssessments will include: 
1.    Implant survivorship based on removal of a study device 
2.    Safety based on incidence  and frequen cy of adverse events 
3.    Clinical perform ance measured by o verall pain and function, quality of l ife data, radiogra phic 
parameters and survivorship 
 
 
V. Study Design 
This is a p rospective, multicent er, non-controlled clinical study designed to facilitate the 
collection and evaluation of pain, function, quality of life, radiograph ic assessment, and adverse 
event data.  A minimum of six U.S.  sites will contribu te to this study. Maximum enrollment per 
site will not exceed 100 implanted knees.  Each Investigator will be skilled in  total knee 
arthroplasty and experie nced implanting the devices included in  this study. 
 
Each  Principal Investigat or will be responsible for obtaining Instituti onal Review Board (IRB) or 
Ethics Comm ittee (EC) approval as required prior to conducting t he study.  In order to avoid 
potential se lection bias, each Investigator will offer study participation to each consecut ive 
patient  presenting as a candidate for primar y total knee arthroplasty using the commerciall y 
available (FDA clea red)  Persona fixed bearing knee system.   Cand idates who express interest in 
study  participation  will  be  offered  Informed  Consent.    All  potential  study  subjects  will  be 
required to participate in the Informed Consent process and will not be considered  enrolled  in 
the study until the  candidate has signed  and dated the IRB/EC  approved patient  Informed 
Consent.    Study  data  cannot  be  collected until  the  candidate  has  completed the  informed 
consent  process and signed and dated the  IRB or EC approved Informed Consent. 
 
All study subjects will undergo  preoperative clin ical evaluations prior to their total kn ee 
arthroplasty.  The post-operati ve clinical and radiograph ic evaluations will be conducted at 6 
weeks, 6 mon ths, 1 year, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years.  
 
The   I nvestigator  will  review  radiographs  at  each  clinical  evaluation  interval  to  ensure 
radiograph ic evidence of adverse  events is documented and reported  to the IRB  or EC and 
Sponsor as required.  At Sponsor’s discret ion, Sponsor may request copies of these radiograph s 
for indepen dent radiologic review.  Sponsor may request one central  reviewer for all rad iograph s 
indepen dent of the surgeon and institution. 
 
 
VI. Study Population 
Study populatio n for primary statist ical analysis  will be comp rised of males and females who 
require primar y total knee arthroplasty and satisfy  the inclusion/exclusion criteria outlined in 
this section of the protocol.   In order to avoid potential selection bias, each Investigat or will 
offer study partici pation to each c onsecut ive patient presenting as a candidate for primary total 
knee arthroplasty using the  comm ercial ly available (FDA cleared)  Persona fixed bearin g knee 
system.    Cand idates  who  express  interest  in  study  particip ation  will  be  offered  Informed

or reg ulatory binder. 
 
Study data will not be collected until the Informed Consent  has been signed  and dated.  If 
the candidate does not wish to particip ate (does not sign and date the Informed Consent ), 
data for that candidate will not be collected  for this study. 
 
C.   Informed  Consent Log 
An Informed Consent  Log (Appendix C) will be maintained at the site throughout the course 
of the study.  The purpose of the Informed Consent  Log is to provide documentation that all 
enrolled stu dy subjects underwent the Informed Consent  process, signed  and dated the IRB 
or EC approved Informed Consent, and were provided with  a copy of the fully executed 
POLAR -TKA: CONF IDENTIAL 
Protocol # CSU2012-10K                                
       January 3, 2014 –Version 3

 consent with  all required signatu res.   All candidates who  sign and date the approved 
Informed Consent for the study must be entered  in the  log.  If a subject signs and dates 
additional Informed C onsent(s) af ter enrol lment (e.g., due to a protocol am endment, 
protocol revisions, etc.), subsequent signings will also b e recorded in the  log.  The Informed 
Consent  Log will be filed in  the si te Regulatory Binder for the study. 
 
D.   Subject Enrollment 
Once  the Informed Consent has been signed and dated by the subject, the subject will be 
considered  enrolled in the  study.  A unique case  identificat ion number (Case ID) will be 
assigned  to each particip ating sub ject/knee (bilateral subjects will be assigned a unique case 
ID number for each  knee).  This unique case  ID number will be used thro ughout the study 
for identific ation.   Case ID numbers will be assigned consecutively in ascending order per 
site, with  the starting numb er for a given si te defined by Sponsor. 
 
E.   Dete rmination of Eligibility 
Once  Informed Consent has been obtained, the su bject’s  eligibility to continue study 
particip ation will be determined by the study inclusion/exclus ion criteria.  This may include 
an i nterview to assess  signifi cant subject medical/surgical history, history of present 
illness/injury, evaluation of present  pain an d functional cap acity, and a radiograph ic 
assess ment.   Evaluation of the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be docume nted on the 
Inclusion/Exclusion Cr iteria case  report form.    Subjects that do not meet all 
inclusion/exclus ion cri teria will be terminated from the study and no further s tudy data will 
be collected.  A Study Com pletion form will be comp leted and the reas on for termination 
must be specified  on the form.  These subjects will be excluded from the  primary stati stical 
analysis for this study. 
 
F. Monitor Log 
The Site Monitoring Visit Log (Appendix C) will be maintained thr oughout the course of the 
study.  The log will contain the visit date, monitor name/signatu re and the purpose of the 
visit (i.e. site initiation, onsite interim monitoring (as applicab le), site close-out, etc.).  The 
site mon itoring visit log will be filed in  the si te Regulatory Binder for the study. 
 
G.   Dele gation of Authority (Site Signature Log) 
A Site Signature Log (Appendix C)  will be maintained throughout the study and will contain 
the na mes, initials, signat ures and study responsibilities of all sit e personnel/designees 
involved in  study procedures and data  collection. The Site Signatu re Log will be filed in the 
site Regulatory Binder for the study.

 N.   Radiographic Definitions and Methods 
All postoperative radiographic evaluations performed acc ording to  the protocol will b e 
reviewed by the Investigat or at the time of the evaluation and documented using the 
Physician Assess ment  of  Post-op  Radiograph s  case  report  form.     This  includes 
documentati on of any significant radiograph ic find ings.  In addition, an Adverse Event 
Report case report form must be completed for those findings indicated  by an asterisk on 
the Physicians Assess ment of Post-op Radiograph case  report  form, or for any other findings 
identified as an  adverse event. 
 
1.   Required rad iograph ic views 
Standing anteroposterior (AP) and stan dard lateral  radiograph s of the operative 
knee  are required to be captured  at the 6 week, 6 month, 1 year, 2 year, 3 year, 
4 year, and 5 year follow-up visits.   
 
Radiograph s  should  h ave  similar  exposu re  and  must  show  the  entire  study 
device and surrounding bone.  For consistency, every effort should  be made to 
capture  all rad iograph ic views for a given subject using the same instituti on 
thro ughout the stu dy.  However, radiographs captured at a d ifferent instituti on 
may be used for the study, provided they meet required study specif ications 
and are captured  within  the required in terval window .  The investigative site will 
retain copies (hard copy/CD/digital) of all rad iograph s referenced for the study. 
 
2.   Submission  to Sponsor 
At S ponsor’s discret ion, study radiographs may be requested fr om the sites  for 
indepen dent radi ographic review and assessment of appropriate parameters. 
 
O.   Recommended Revision Procedure 
See Management of Incurrent Events  (Section IX, Subsection D of this protocol) 
 
 
IX. Reporting 
The management of all study data received by Sponsor will be the responsibilit y of Sponsor or 
its Designee.   The use or disclo sure of all protected health  information will comp ly with  the 
Health  Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  All information will be treated wi th 
strict  adherence  to professional stan dards of confidentiality and will be filed by Sponsor under 
adequate security and restricted  accessibility by clinical personnel.  All electronic systems used 
to create, mod ify, maintain, or transmit study records will be validated according to 21 CFR Part 
11(ii).  Reports and comm unicatio ns relati ng to study subjects will typically  identify each subject 
only by the subject’s initials, assigned study subject Case ID number, date of surgery, operative 
side, and date  of birth. 
 
A.   Prior to Initiation of the Study 
1.   Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA) 
A fully executed (signed by all required partie s) CTA must be on file with  Sponsor 
prior to any investigator particip ating in th is study.

2.   Instituti onal Review Board/ Ethics Committee Protocol Approval 
This study protocol must be submitted to  and approved by the Investigator’s 
Instituti onal Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC).  A copy of the IRB or EC 
approval let ter must be submitted to Sponsor.   The letter should  identify the 
following: 
Protocol name and/or number 
Date of IRB or EC meeting (if av ailable) 
Date of approval 
Date of expiration 
Signatu re of IRB or EC 
 
3.   Informed C onsent 
A Sponsor-approved Informed Consent document (Appendix A Sample) will be 
provided along with the study protocol for IRB o r EC submission  and approval. If the 
IRB or EC req uires revisions to  the provided Informed C onsent, the  requested 
revisions must be submitted by the Investigator to Sponsor for review and approval. 
Once  Sponsor has reviewed and approved the revision, the Informed Consent will 
be re-submitted to the IRB or EC for final review and approval.  A copy of the final 
IRB or EC approved Informed C onsent form (ICF) must be submitted to Sponsor. 
 
B.   Clinical Data Collection/Submission 
1.   Summary of Cas e Report Form Data Collection 
Study data will be collected on study-specif ic Case  Report Forms (CRFs) p rovided by 
Sponsor.  For subjects having bilateral knee replacement, separ ate case  report 
forms must be comp leted for each operative side. 
 
The following CRF gu idelines should  be followed: 
 
Complete carefu lly and accurately . 
Complete header information consistently  across all case  report forms for each 
individual stu dy subject. 
Use the study subject’s initials in  header  section. 
Use the study subject’s unique Case  ID number assigned as  instructed. 
Do not provide information that is not requested on the CRFs.  
Ensure that all field s are completed.  For fields completed by the s ubject, efforts 
should  be made to obtain any missing responses prior to the subject completing 
their visit. 
 
2.   Data Su bmission 
Completed CRFs will be submitted directly to Sponsor by electronic data capture 
and submission  via a method approved by Sponsor. Every effort must be made to 
ensure data submission to Sponsor is made within  30 days of the visit completion. 
 
3.   Quality Assurance of Data 
The Investigator sho uld ensure the accu racy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness 
of the data reported to the Sponsor in the CRFs  and in all required reports.  Data 
repor ted  on  the  CRF,  which  are  derived  from  source  documents,  should  be

 consistent with  the source documents  or the discrepancies should  be explained.  All 
electronic systems used to create, modify, maintain, or transmit electronic study 
records will be validated according to 21 CFR Part 11(ii).   Sponsor will maintain 
quality control systems, in accordance with Sponsor’s policies and pro cedures. 
 
C. Reporting Requirements 
1.   Investigator Reporting Responsibilities  
The Investigator should ensure the accu racy, completeness, legibility, and  timeliness 
of data reported to the Sponsor in accordance with th is protocol.  The Investigator 
or Designee will provide periodic re ports to their IRB or EC as required to maintain 
IRB or EC approval throughout the study, and  will provide any required fin al 
reportin g to the IRB o r EC upon study completion/termination.  A copy of all IRB or 
EC re-approval letters must be submitted to the Sponsor.  If the IRB  or EC 
terminates or suspends its approval of the study, the Investigator or Designee wi ll 
suspend study-related activities and will promptly notify the Sponsor.  The 
Investigator should also promp tly provide written reports to the Sponsor and the 
IRB or EC regarding any changes  significantly affecting  the conduct of the study, 
and/or increasin g risk to the subje cts. 
 
2.   Retention of Records 
Study records must be retained by  the Investigator or Designee for a minimum of 2 
years from the Investigator’s study termination date, or per  applicable re gulatory 
and/or IRB or EC requirements  (whic hever time period is greater). Measu res shall 
be taken to prevent accidental or premature destruction. 
 
D.  Management of Incurrent Events 
1. Failure to Obtain Informed Consent  
Study data will not be collected until the Informed Consent  has been signed  and 
dated by the candidate.  If a candidate does not wish to  participate (does not sign 
and date the Informed Consent), data for that candidate will not be collected for 
this study. 
 
2.   Adverse  Events  
An adverse event is any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, or disease 
associated with  the use of the  study device, whether or not related  to the device. 
Adverse  event is  synonymou s with complicat ion or medical event. 
 
See Sect ion IX, Subsection E of this protocol for additional information regarding 
adverse ev ent classificat ions.  All medical events,  regardless of classif ication, are 
required to be reported on the Adverse Event Report case report form.   The 
completed Adverse Event Report case  repo rt form must be submitted to Sponsor in 
a timely manner.  The Investigator or Designee will also promp tly provide Sponsor 
with  any additional req uested information req uired fo r Sponsor to comply with 
regulatory requirements.   If applicab le per their  reporti ng requirements, the 
Investigator or Designee will also report applicab le adverse e vent(s) to their  IRB or 
EC.

Page 15 of 24  
 3.   Revision 
In  the  event  that  removal  of  one  or  more  of  the  study  knee  comp onents  is 
necessary,  the  Investigator  will  determine  the  best  treatment  and/or  revision 
method for the subject. 
 
Prior to revision surgery, the Investigator or qualified Designee must document any 
signifi cant radiograph ic fin dings r elated to the n eed for revision on the Physician 
Assess ment of Postop Radiograph s case  repo rt form.  An Adverse  Event case report 
form  must  be  completed  for  those  findings  indicated  by  an  asterisk  on  the 
Physician s Asse ssment of Postop Radiograph case  report form. 
 
Once  the  revision  surgery  has  been  completed,  the  Investigator  or  qualified 
Designee must complete an  Adverse Event ca se report form as w ell as  a Study 
Completion case  repo rt form terminating the subject fro m the study.  For the study 
completion status, select “Study Prosthesis Remov ed”.  This procedure also applies 
to partial re visions such as  polyethyle ne excha nge. 
 
4.   Investigator With drawal 
The Investigator can ch oose to with draw a subject from the study if the  subject no 
longer meets stu dy inclusion/exclus ion criteria.  The rea son for the Investigator’s 
with drawal  of  the  subject  must  be  documented  on  the  Study  Completion case 
report  form. 
 
5.   Subject Withdrawal  
Study subjects may choose to with draw from the study at any time, for any reason. 
If possible, a final evaluation will be c ompleted for any subject who  no longer wishes 
to particip ate in the study.   The reas on for the su bject withdrawal must be 
documented  on the Study Completion case report form. 
 
6.   Lost to Follow-up 
A study subject will be considered  lost to follow-up after they have missed  a visit 
and attempts to locate and evaluate the subject using the procedure outlined below 
have failed.   All attempts to  contact the subject are to be documented  in the 
subject’s medical record and on the Study Completion case  report form.  Missed 
visit(s) also must be documented using the Protocol Deviations case  report form. 
The first three  contact attempts should be made by telephone, with additional 
attempts as outlined in  the following table: 
 
If Then 
a respo nse is not received after  three 
(3) phone calls  the   Investigator   or   Designee   shou ld 
send  a   letter to the subject explaining 
the follow-up a greement per the 
Informed Consent, and req uesting a 
respo nse from the s ubject. 
all attempts to contact the subject are 
unsuccessful  or  t he subject is 
contacted and chooses to withdraw 
from the study a  Study  Completion  case  report  form 
will be completed and w ill specify  the

7.   Protocol Deviations 
Investigators should not deviate from the study protocol.   If a protocol deviation 
does occur,  the  deviation must be documented on the Protocol Deviatio n case 
report fo rm and submitted to Sponsor.    If applicab le per their  reporting 
requirements, the Investigator or Designee will also report applicab le protocol 
deviations to their IRB  or EC. 
 
8.   Study Termination 
Study subject particip ation is expec ted to end upon completion of the subject’s 5- 
year follow-up visit unless the subject voluntarily with draws  from the study, is 
with drawn  fro m  the  study  by  the  Investigat or,  is  lost  to  follow-up,  undergo es 
revision to remov e a stu dy device, or expires.  Reason(s) for study completion must 
be documented on the Study Completion case  repo rt form. 
 
If   Sp onsor   decides   to   terminate   the   study   early,   Sponsor   will   i nform   the 
Investigators of the reason for early  study termination.  It is the responsibility of the 
Investigators to inform their IRB or EC as  applica ble according to local a nd national 
laws /regulatio ns. 
 
9.   Modification of the Protocol 
All am endments  to this clinical pro tocol shall be agreed to by Sponsor and  be 
recorded with  a justific ation for the amendment pr ior to implementation. Approval 
of the applicab le IRB  or EC must be obtained p rior to implementation, if required 
according to the local a nd/or nat ional law s/regulations. 
 
E.   Medical Events/Adverse Events De finitions and Classifications 
An adverse event is any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, or disease associated 
with  the use of the study device, whet her or not related to the device.  Adverse ev ent is 
synonym ous with complication or medical event.   All medical events,  regardless of 
classificat ion, are required to be reported on the Adverse  Event Report case  repo rt 
form.    The comp leted Adverse Event Report case  report form must be submitted to 
Sponsor in a timely manner.  The Investigator or Designee will also promptly provide 
Sponsor with any additional req uested information required for Sponsor to comply with 
regulatory   requirements.      If   applicab le   per   their   repo rting   requirements,   the 
Investigator or Designee will also  report applicab le adverse event(s) to their IRB or EC. 
 
1.   Class ificat ion of the Event: 
Adverse Even t (AE)(i): 
An Adverse  Event is any untoward  medical occur rence, unintended disease  or 
injury, or untoward clin ical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in 
subjects, users or other  persons, whet her or not related to the medical device.

       January 3, 2014 –Version 3    
 
Page 17 of 24  
 Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)(i): 
A Serious Adverse Event is any adverse  event that 
a.    led to  death  
b.   led to serious deterioration in the health  of the subject, that either 
resu lted in 
1.   a life -thre atening illness or injury, or 
2.   a per manent impairment of a body structure or a body function, 
or 
3.   in-patient or prolonged  hospitalization, or 
4.   medical  or  surgical  intervention  to  prevent  life-threatening 
illness or injury or permanent i mpairment to a body structure or 
a body function 
c. led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth 
defect. 
Note: Plann ed hospitalization for a pre-existing c ondition, or a procedure 
required by the protocol, with out serious deterioration in health,  is not 
considered  a serious adverse event. 
 
Adverse Device Effect (ADE)(i): 
An A dverse  Device Effect  is an adverse  event related  to the use of a medical 
device. 
 
Note 1: This definition includes adverse events  resulting from insufficient  or 
inadequate instruct ions for use, deployment, implantation, installa tion, or 
operation, or any malfunction of the medical d evice. 
 
Note 2: This definition includes any event resu lting from use error or from 
intentional misuse of the medical device. 
 
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE)(i): 
A Serious Adverse Device Effect  is an adverse device effe ct that has resu lted in 
any of the consequences  characterist ic of a serious adverse  event. 
 
Sponsor is responsible for determining the final class ificatio n of adverse events. 
 
If an Un anticip ated Serious Adverse Device Effect (USADE)  is identified by Sponsor, it will 
be promptly repo rted to concerned  Investigat ors and regulatory authorities  as req uired 
by applicable regulatory requirements.  If applicab le per their  reporti ng requirements, 
the Investigator or Designee will report the USADE to their IRB or EC. 
 
2.   Intensity of Symptoms 
Mild: 
The subject is awar e of the sign or symptom, but finds it easily  tolerated.  The 
event is of little concern to the subject and/or little clinical signifi cance.   The 
event is not expec ted to have any effect on the subject’s overall health  or well 
being.

       January 3, 2014 –Version 3    
 
Page 18 of 24  
 Moderate: 
The subject has discomfort enough to cause interference with or change in 
usual activ ities.   The event is of some concern to the subject’s health  or well 
being and may require medical inter vention and/or close follow-up. 
 
Severe: 
The event interfere s considerab le with  the subject’s  usual activ ities.  The event 
is  of  definite  concern  to  the  subject  and/or  poses  substantial  risk  to  the 
subject’s  health  or  well-being.     The event is likely  to require medical 
intervention   and/or   close   follow-up   and   m ay   be   incapacitating   o r   life 
threateni ng. Hospitalization and treatment may be required. 
 
NOTE:  The term “severe” refers  to the intensity of the event and can be used 
with  any event, without regard to whet her or not it meets the criteria for being 
classif ied as “serious” or “unanticipated”.  For example, a subject can have a 
severe headache, but it is not a serious event. 
 
3.   Outcome Definitions 
The outcome  is in relationship to the Adverse Event, not the treatment rendered  for 
the event (if any ). 
 
Reso lved: 
The adverse event has been resolved and/or no further  treatment is required to 
treat  the reported condition or illn ess. 
 
Tolerated: 
The adverse  event will most likely never be resolved.   The subject “tolerates” 
the illn ess or condition as a matter of life. 
 
Pending: 
Trea tment or diagnostic studies were prescri bed for the adverse  event and the 
outcome of the adverse  event is  not yet known. 
 
Study With drawal:  
Due to the a dverse event, the subject was withdrawn from the study. 
 
Device Remova l: 
The adverse  event resulted  in the r emoval of a study device. 
 
Reoperation of Affected J oint: 
The   adverse  event   resu lted   in   reoperation  of   the   study  joint,   but  the

F.  Monitoring of the Study 
Prior to initiating the clinical study, Sponsor will c onduct a site initiation visit to ensure 
the Investiga tor(s) and study staff  understand the study protocol and req uirements and 
have adequate time and resources to  implement a nd conduct the study.  Prior to study 
initiatio n, the  Investigator must have a fully executed CTA a nd IRB o r EC app roval of the 
study protocol and the study Informed Consent. 
 
During the course of the stu dy, Sponsor will conduct periodic central monitoring and 
maintain contact with  the study staff to mon itor compliance and evidence  of adverse 
events, in accordance with S ponsor’s policies and procedures.  Sponsor will address any 
identified  non-compliance with  the execut ed CTA, stu dy protocol, and applicab le 
regulatory requirements.  
 
If onsite monitoring visit(s)  are de emed ap propriate by Sponsor, the Investigator will 
permit representati ves of Sponsor’s monitoring team  to have direct access to inspect all 
source data /documents, study documents/binders, study subject case  report forms, 
correspon ding sections of study subject medical/hospital re cords, and any other 
documents  relevant to the study.  All Sponsor visits (including site initiation) will be 
documented us ing the Si te Monitoring Visit  Log (Appendix C).  
 
 
X. Risk Analysis 
This post-market clinical study is classif ied as minimal risk(ii)  and there are no anticip ated risks 
specif ic to study particip ation other  than  the potential loss of confidentia lity. There are no 
exper imental  procedures in this study, and particip ation in th is study is not anticipated to affect 
the medical treatment of enrolled su bjects. 
 
When  used in accordance with  product labeling , the risks  associated with  the use of Persona 
knee components  are similar to those of stan dard, metal-on-polyethylene knee systems used 
for the same clinical indication or purpose.  These risks are categorized below as either  gener al 
surgical risks o r ris ks as sociated with the  total knee arthroplasty  procedure/study device. 
Unanticip ated adverse events can also occur.  
 
A.   General Surgical Risks 
Gene ral surg ical risks  and post-operative adverse events can occur  with a ny surgery and 
include, but are not limited to: 
Anesthetic complications/reactions 
Bleedi ng and/or excessive blood-loss 
Tran sfusion reaction 
Chronic Pain 
Post-operative infection 
Vasc ular injury 
Delayed wound healin g 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 
Nerve injury

B.   Risks Ass ociated with Total Knee Arthroplasty Procedure/Study Device  
Potential adverse events  associated w ith total knee  arthroplasty  include, but are not limited 
to: 
Wear of the polyethyle ne articulatin g surface 
Progressive bone resorption (osteolysis) as a  result of foreign-body reaction to 
wear de bris 
Loosening of the prosthetic  knee components 
Fracture /damage of the prosthetic knee components 
Soft tissue impingement or damage 
Dislocation and/or joint instability 
Malalignm ent of the prosthetic knee components  
Bone fracture 
Nerve damage 
Swellin g 
Infection 
Leg length d iscrepa ncies 
Poor rang e of motion 
Delayed wound healin g 
Temporary or permanent neuropathies 
Pain 
Card iovascular disorders including venous thrombosis, pulmon ary embolism, or 
myocard ial in farction 
Histological re actions resulting in inflammation 
Metal sensitivity 
Corrosion of metal components  (the signifi cance and long-term implicat ions are 
uncertain and await further clin ical evidence  and evaluation) 
 
Minimization of Risk 
Investigators should re fer to the packa ge insert for additional information and instructi ons. 
 
 
XI. Stati stical Considerat ions 
Performance of comm ercia lly available Persona  fixed  bearin g knee  components  in primary  total 
knee arthro plasty will be ev aluated for pain, function, quality of life, and survivorship.  Data 
collected in this study will be summarized descriptively and descriptive summaries will be the 
basis of any study reports issue d.  These  summaries may be used for interim study repo rts and 
may also be used to su pport regulatory submissions, presentati ons, and/o r publicatio ns. 
Additional surgical technique and instr umentati on data may be collected and evaluated. 
 
A.   General Statistical Methods 
Statistical methodology will consist of summarizing collected data descriptively.  Categ orical 
data (e. g., gender or race) will be summarized using counts and percentages, and 95% 
Confidence  Interval (CI ), over  the time periods of interest. Continuous data, such  as age, will 
be summarized by using means,  medians, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and 
95% CI over the time periods of interest.   Implant survival and return  to function will be

 summarized using a Kaplan-Meier method and presented  with  rates (as percentages)  and 
confidence  intervals. 
 
B.   Sample Size 
Sample size is based  on a longitudinal data collection mod el and using survivability as the 
primary  endpoint of interest.  The attr ition rate is assumed to be 10%.

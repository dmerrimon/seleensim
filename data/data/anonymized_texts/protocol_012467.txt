Amendment Summary  
1. Modified 3.2.8 criterion to exclude subjects with a history of non -infectious 
pneumonitis that required steroids because pneumonitis is an identified  risk of 
pembrolizumab therapy. Subjects with current non -infectious pneumonitis are also 
excluded from study participation.  
2. Checks for respiratory signs/symptoms + respiratory history were added to 
Evaluations and Assessments in section 6.0 of the protocol . These changes are now 
noted in  Time and Events tables 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and acco mpanying footnotes added  to 
account for these assessments .  Ongoing patients are to be evaluated for active 
pneumonitis. Patients with a history of pneumonitis should be re-consented for this 
trial to consider if they should continue pembrolizumab or discontinue treatment 
based on the risk of fatal pneumonitis reported in recent safety findings.  
In addition, assessments of respiratory signs/symptoms are now included in sec tions 
6.4, 6.5.1, 6.5.2, 6.6.4, 6.6.5, 6.7.1, 6.7.3, and 6.8 of the protocol.  
3. Noted that the optional biopsy only applies to patients enrolled at UNC in section s 
6.5.3 and  6.11.2  
4. Corrected the study schema to remove language about the preconsent  in section  4.1. 
5. Updated the following sections of the protocol to align with the most recent dose 
modification and guidelines recommended for Merck protocols: Inclusion criteria 
3.1.11 and 3.1. 12; Added section 5.1. 8 – Contraception which provides  details on 
accepta ble methods of birth control f or WOCBP and males on the study;  also updated 
sections 4.5.3, 4.5.4, 4.6.1, 4.6.2, 5.1.11, 7.1.1, 7.1.4, and 7.3.3. Section 7.1.5 was 
deleted.

 7 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Study Synopsis  
This open -label, three -arm, non-compar ative randomized phase II study  is 
designed to evaluate three different sequences of double -consolidation with the 
humanized monoclonal antibody targeted against cell surface receptor 
programmed cell death -1 (PD -1), pembrolizumab , and nab -paclitaxel  in patients  
with advanced NSCLC post induction chemotherapy . While the goal of each arm 
is to guarantee exposure to each of these two agents to patients who have not 
progressed post induction chemotherapy, they do so with different sequence.  In 
ARMs A and B, consoli dation is sequential, with either pembrolizumab followed 
by nab -paclitaxel (ARM A), or nab -paclitaxel followed by pembrolizumab (ARM 
B. In ARM C , consolidation is concurrent, with the two agents administered 
concurrently. Effective at the time of approval of this amendment , only ARM A 
will be enrolling new subjects.  
 
We plan to enroll 35 patients into the study , with a primary objective of 
estimating  overall survival (OS)  in each arm . Secondary objectives include 
estimating rates of response (via RECIST1.1 and Immune  Related Response 
Criteria (irRC)), clinician observed and patient reported toxicity, progression -free 
survival and quality of life  in each arm . 
1.2 Duration of therapy for metastatic NSCLC  
The standard of care to treat metastatic NSCLC is a platinum -based doublet  of 
chemotherapy (“induction” therapy) . Two trials established the appropriate 
duration of induction therapy.  One trial randomized patients to 4 cycles of 
treatment followed by observation vs. treatment until intolerance or progressi ve 
disease  (PD) ; there was no survival advantage for indefinite therapy [2].  The 
other randomized patients with no PD after 2 cycle of platinum -based doublet 
therapy to two additional cycles of therapy or to four additional cycles of therapy; 
again, there was no survival advantage for prolongation of induction therapy [3].  
These two trials established 4 cycles of platinum -based doublet therapy as the 
standard of care.   
 
Recently, a series of trials have demonstrated a survival advantage w hen this 
initial induction regimen is followed by “maintenance” therapy, via use of a new 
agent (“switch maintenance”) or by continuing one or more of the non -platinum 
drugs used in induction (“continuation maintenance”). These trials have 
demonstrated sma ll survival advantages, but at the cost of denying patients a 
treatment break.  Switch maintenance has shown a larger survival advantage than 
continuation maintenance, likely reflecting the value of guaranteed exposure to 
non-cross resistant therapy [4]. One historic trial demonstrated a PFS advantage, 
with a strong trend towards an OS advantage with fixed duration switch 
maintenance (hereafter called “consolidation”) [1]. In this trial, patients in the 
LCCC 1516   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Jared Weiss, MD   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Amendment 4    May 23 , 2018  
 
 8 experimental arm received six cycles of consolidation docetaxel, while patients in 
the control arm were observed.   
 
 
At the time of PD, patients in the observation arm who rece ived second - line 
therapy (referred to as “delayed” therapy in slide above) received docetaxel; 40% 
of the 154 patients in the observation arm did not receive second - line docetaxel 
(mostly their PFS events were death, or they were too sick from symptoms o f 
progression to receive docetaxel ). Amongst the 60% who were able to receive it, 
survival was identical to that in the experimental arm  (the experimental arm is 
referred to as “immediate” in the slide above) , suggesting that the greatest benefit 
of switch  maintenance is guaranteed exposure to a non -cross -resistant agent.  
 
 
 
The current trial seeks to guarantee exposure to two non -cross resistant agents , 
with a goal of improving OS.  
1.3 Pembrolizumab (MK -3475)  
Pembrolizumab (MK -3475) is a potent and highly sel ective intravenous 
humanized mAb) of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G4/kappa isotype that directly 
blocks the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, PD -L1 and PDL -2. This 

LCCC 1516   CONFIDENTIAL

 9 blockade enhances functional activity of the target lymphocytes to facilitate an 
antitumo r immune response, leading to tumor regression and immune rejection of 
the tumor. Indications currently under investigation by the manufacturer of 
pembrolizumab include non -small cell lung cancer and glioblastoma. KeytrudaTM 
(Pembrolizumab) has recently be en approved (at a dose of 2 mg/kg IV every 3 
weeks) in the United Stated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma and disease progression following ipilumumab and, if 
BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. Further deve lopment of 
pembrolizumab in non -metastatic melanoma is ongoing. [5] 
1.3.1 Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background  
The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of 
neoplastic transformation has been known for decades [6].  Accumulating 
evidence shows a correlation between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) i n 
cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in various malignancies [7-11].  In 
particular, the pre sence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T -cells / 
FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and long -
term survival in many solid tumors.  
 
The PD -1 receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to 
suppress immune control.  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell 
surface of activated T -cells under healthy conditions, is to down -modulate 
unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 
(encoded by the gene PDCD1 ) is an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily member 
related to CD28 and CTLA -4 that has been shown to negatively regulate antigen 
receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2) [12, 
13].  The structure of murine PD -1 has been resolved [9].  PD -1 and family 
members are type I transmembra ne glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable -type 
(V-type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is 
responsible for the binding of signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 
contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based 
inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif 
(ITSM).   
 
Following T -cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases SHP -1 and 
SHP-2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the 
dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70, all of 
which are involved in the CD3 T -cell signaling cascade [12, 14-16].  The 
mechanism by which PD -1 down modulates T -cell responses is similar to, but 
distinct from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules regulate an overlapping set of 
signaling proteins [13; 14].  PD-1 is expressed on activated lymphocytes 
including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T regs and Natural Killer 
cells [17, 18].  Expression has also been shown during thymic development on 
CD4 -CD8 - (double negati ve) T -cells as well as subsets of macrophages and 
dendritic cells [19].

 10 The lig ands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are constitutively expressed or can be 
induced in a variety of cell types, including non -hematopoietic tissues as well as 
in various tumors [19-22].  Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors 
containing both IgV - and IgC -like domains in the extracellular region and short 
cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of eith er PD -1 
ligand to PD -1 inhibits T -cell activation triggered through the T -cell receptor.  
PD-L1 is expressed at low levels on various non -hematopoietic tissues, most 
notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably 
expressed on ant igen-presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic 
inflammatory environments.  PD -L2 is thought to control immune T -cell 
activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -
cell function in peripheral tissues [23].  Although healthy organs express little (if 
any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers are known to express abundant levels of this T -
cell inhibitor.  PD -1 has been suggested to regulate tumor -specific T -cell 
expansion in subject s with melanoma (MEL) [24].  This suggests that the PD -
1/PD -L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be 
considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention . 
1.3.2 Pre-clinical Findings  
Pembrolizumab  strong ly enhances  T-lymphoc yte immune  responses  in 
cultured  blood  cells from  healt hy human  donors,  cancer  patients,  and primates.   
In T-cell activation  assays using  human  donor  blood  cells,  the EC50  
(concentration wher e 50%  of the maximum effect  is achieved)  has been  
reported to be ~0.1 to 0.3 nM.  Levels of  interleukin -2 (IL-2), tumor 
necrosis  factor  alpha  (TNFα),  interferon  gamma  (IFN
), and other  cytokines 
are modulated  by MK-3475.   The antibody  potentiates  existing  immune 
responses on ly in the presence of antigen and does not nonspecifical ly activate  T-
cells. [5] 
 
Using an  anti-murine  PD-1 analog antibod y, PD-1 blockade has been shown to 
significant ly inhibit  tumor  growt h in a varie ty of syngeneic  murine  tumor  
models.   In these  experiment s in mice , anti-PD-1 therap y is synergistic  with 
chemotherapeutic  agents such  as gemcitabine  and 5-fluorouracil  (5-FU) and 
combination  therapy results  in increased complete tumor regression rates in 
vivo. [5] 
 
The safety of MK-3475  was characterized  in the 1-month  repea t-dose toxicit y 
study in cynomolgus  monke ys when  administered  as intravenous (I V) doses  of 6, 
40 or 200 mg/kg  once  a week (a total of five doses)  and in the 6-month  repeat -
dose toxicit y study in the same specids  when  administered  as IV doses  of 6, 40 
or 200 mg/k g every other  week (a total of 12 doses) .  MK-3475 was  well-
tolerated  with a systemic  exposure  (area under the curve (AUC))  of up to 
~170,000  μg.da y/mL over the course of the 1-month  study, and with an AUC of  
up to approximatel y 67,500 μg.da y/mL over the course of the 6 -mont h study. No 
findings of toxicological significance  were  observed  in either  study and the No 
Observed Adverse Event Level (NOAEL)  was ≥200  mg/kg .   In addition,  no

1.4 Clinical Efficacy of Pembrolizumab in human NSCLC  
Pembrolizumab is very active against human NSCLC.  For example, in a second 
line study  using pembrolizumab as monotherapy , 58% of tumors had some 
reduction in size [25]: 
 
 
 
Most of these responses occurred by 10 weeks and many were durable:  
 
 
While pembrolizumab is very active, it is has very low toxicity.  Overall toxicity 
in 119 patients treated in the study just refere nced with a higher dose (10mg/kg 
Q3W) than  that proposed in LCCC1516 (200mg fixed dose) was as follows:

In pretreated NSCLC patients, only 1/38 experience d a grade 3 -5 event, 
pulmonary edema.  Therefore, in addition to being very active, pembroliuzmab is 
far less toxic than the cytotoxic agents typically used for NSCLC.  
Pembrolizumab, along with other PD1 and PDL1 inhibitors, are however, 
associated with a novel problem: pseudo -progression:  
 
[26] 
 
In the above spider plot, t he green arrows represent this phenomenon, where the 
cancer appears to grow, but later shrinks.  The two dominant explanations are that 
immunotherapy takes time to work in some cancers and that immune infiltration 
causes inflammation and takes up space.  R egardless, it creates a novel problem —
a review of the spider plots of pembrolizumab, other anti-PD1 agents, and anti-
PDL1 agents, both in NSCLC and in other cancers , reveals that the majority of 
apparent progression is, in fact, real progression.  New stra tegies are needed to 
address this problem.

 13 1.5 Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane ®) 
The active cytotoxic agent in nanoalbumin bound paclitaxel (henceforth nab -
paclitaxel) is paclitaxel, an antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of 
microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing 
depolymerization. Nab -paclitaxel delivers the paclitaxel bound to albumin and has 
several theoretic advantages over paclitaxel  [27]. First, the cremophor solvent is 
not needed.  Cremophor requires special glass or non -PVC infus ion systems, 
premedication with histamine 1 and 2 blockers, causes infusion reactions and may 
contribute to peripheral neuropathy.  As albumin facilitates the administration of 
water -insoluble compounds, effective active dose -delivery of albumin bound 
drugs may be higher than when drugs are administered without albumin.  Infusion 
time with nab -paclitaxel is faster than with paclitaxel.  Binding of the active drug 
to albumin may increase tumor -specificity, perhaps due to increased endothelial 
cell binding an d transcytosis of the albumin -bound drug versus cremophor -based 
paclitaxel formulations. [28]  Critically for this study, nab -paclitaxel, unlike 
paclitaxel and most other cytotoxic agents used in NSCLC , does not require 
steroid premedication.  
 
Nab-paclitaxel showed improved response rates (RR) compared to standard 
paclitaxel when combined with carboplatin for the treatment of advanced 
NSCLC. [29] Response rate to stan dard carboplatin and paclitaxel was 25%; with  
carboplatin and nab -paclitaxel  it was 33% (p=.005); most of this difference was 
driven by subjects with squamous histology (24% vs 41% RR).  Although 
effective dose delivery was higher with nab -paclitaxel (82 mg/m2/week) 
compared to standard paclitaxel (65 mg/m2/week) the overall toxic ity profile, with 
the exception of anemia and thrombocytopenia, favored nab -paclitaxel, (table 
below summarizes the most common grade 3 and 4 treatment related adverse

 14 1.6 Combination of Pembrolizumab plus Chemotherapy  
Several phase I/II studies are ongoing evaluating the combination of 
pembrolizumab with chemotherapy, including a Merck -sponsored study 
combining pembrolizumab with either cisplatin and pemetrexed or carboplatin 
and paclitaxel in NSCLC ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). A second Merck -sponsored phase I/II 
trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is ongoing in unresectable or metastatic NSCLC, and 
includes a number of arms combining fixed dose pembrolizumab with paclitaxel 
(200mg/m2) and carboplatin every 3 weeks, each given on D1 of every 3 week 
cycle, with or without bevacizumab. A third multi -arm phase I/II trial in patients 
with metastatic solid tumors ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is o ngoing. Arm 3 of this trial 
includes a fixed dose of pembrolizumab on D1combined with gemcitabine 
(1000mg/m2 D1 and D8) and nab -paclitaxel 125mg/m2 (D1&D8) every 3 weeks.   
 
Safety data is pending from these studies. However, the major toxicities of 
pembro lizumab including low grade nausea, anorexia, arthralgia, pruritis, diarrhea 
and rash should not overlap with the major toxicities of nab -paclitaxel as outlined 
above, and the mechanisms of action are distinct (meaning we expect no more 
than additive toxic ity).  Therefore, no serious safety issues are anticipated as a 
result of this combination given the low likelihood of overlapping toxicities. Any 
unexpected toxicities from the chemotherapy combination trials just summarized 
and sponsored by Merck will be  shared with the PI of LCCC1516 and can be used 
to supplement toxicity monitoring if needed. In this trial, toxicity will be 
monitored continuously, with sequential boundaries employed to suspend the trial 
if excessive toxicity is seen. If the study reache s a stopping boundary, it may be 
terminated by the PI, or submitted to the DSMC with a description of the 
toxicities and a rationale for why the study should be continued.  
1.7 Study Rationale  
 Improve survival : The primary goal of the trial is to guarantee expo sure to 2 
additional active agents during first line therapy.  
 Give patients a defined end to 1st line treatment : While patients value 
improvements in survival and are willing to be treated longer if they can live 
longer, many patients also want a defined e nd to 1st line therapy.  
 Evaluate defined -duration checkpoint inhibitory therapy:  Existing studies of PD1 
and PDL1 inhibitors almost  universally study therapy until intolerance or 
progression.  It is possible that similar benefits can be achieved with defin ed-
duration therapy.  
 Explore the optimal sequencing of multiple consolidations :  No statistical 
comparison is planned between the three initial arms, although it is possible that 
one sequence may result in a much greater difference compared to the common 
null hypothesis than the others.  If pembrolizumab and nab -paclitaxel have 
synergistic activity, survival may be optimal with immediate concurrent 
consolidation with both agents. Further, survival may be optimal with this 
approach because it guarantees imme diate exposure to both agents.  On the other 
hand, toxicity (specifically ≥ Grade 2 treatment -related adverse events (AEs)) 
LCCC 1516   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Jared Weiss, MD   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Amendment 4    May 23 , 2018  
 
 15 may be lower  with serial administration of the consolidation agents; if such 
improved tolerance leads to greater feasibility, surviv al might be improved with 
sequential administration.  Further, if the agents have any antagonism or if a 
longer duration of treatment is superior, then survival might be better with 
sequential administration.   Results from this trial will also provide esti mates that 
can be used to power a future confirmatory comparative study.  
 Demonstrate potential additive or synergistic effects of chemotherapy and 
immunotherapy : While other planned studies combine chemotherapy and PD -1 
inhibition, they suffer from the nee d to utilize steroids to protect against nausea 
and anaphylaxis from cytotoxic agents.  Because nab -paclitaxel uniquely does not 
require steroids, it might decrease the risk of steroid -related depletion of activated 
tumor -specific T cells.  
1.7.1 Rationale for Dose Selection of Pembrolizumab   
An open -label Merck -sponsored Phase I trial (Protocol 001) evaluated the safety 
and clinical activity of single agent pembrolizumab. The dose escalation portion 
of this trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, a nd 10 mg/kg, 
administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All 
dose levels were well tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) were 
observed.  This first in human study of pembrolizumab showed evidence of target 
engagemen t and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels.  No 
maximally tolerated dose (MTD) has been identified to date. Recent data from 
other clinical studies within the pembrolizumab program have shown that a lower 
dose of pembrolizumab and a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for target 
engagement and clinical activity.  
 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data analysis of pembrolizumab administered Q2W and 
Q3W showed slow systemic clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long 
half-life. [5]  Pharmacodynamic (PD) data (IL -2 release assay) suggested that 
peripheral target en gagement is durable (>21 days).  This early PK and PD data 
provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.   
 
A population PK analysis of pembrolizumab has been performed using serum 
concentration time data from 476 patients. Withi n the resulting population PK 
model, clearance and volume parameters of pembrolizumab were found to be 
dependent on body weight. The relationship between clearance and body weight, 
with an allometric exponent of 0.59, is within the range observed for other  
antibodies and supports both body weight normalized dosing or a fixed dose 
across all body weights (Merck, written communication).   
 
The choice of the 200 mg every 3 weeks as an appropriate dose for the switch to 
fixed dosing of pembrolizumab (which is pending FDA approval, and which is 
incorporated into this study ) is based on simulations performed using the 
population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg 
every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consist ent with those 
obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks (the current FDA approved dose),

 16 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range established in 
melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain 
indiv idual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that 
are well tolerated and safe (Merck, written communication).  The fixed dosing 
regimen will also reduce potential for dosing errors and reduce the complexity 
associated with weight -based dosing.  
 
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for 
physicians and to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will 
also reduce complexity in the logistical chain at treatment facilities and redu ce 
wastage.

 5 4.3 Treatment Decisions Regarding Progressive Disease by ARM  
At each imaging time -point throughout the study (see Section 6.0) both 
RECIST1.1 and adapted irRC will be applied. However, use of these criteria to 
make tr eatment decisions based on presence or absence of PD will vary by ARM 
as outlined below.   
4.3.1 ARM A  
During the first consolidation with pembrolizumab  monotherapy  progression will 
be assess ed via an adapted irRC (see section 6.13.2 ) after cycle 4 . All patients will 
be scanned prior to cycle 3  (after  cycle 2) , however in patients without symptoms 
of progression, this data  will be used principally for spider -plots and hypothesis 
generation.   If symptoms of progression are evident and accompanied by a rapid 
decline in ECOG PS, or that in the opinion of the investigator otherwise 
endangers the patient, it will be acceptable to discontinue pembrolizumab and 
immediately initiate nab -paclitaxel. During the second consolidation with nab -
paclitaxel  monotherapy , PD will be based on RECIST1.1 (see section 6.13.1 ). If 
progression is noted during the second consolidation, the patient will discontinue 
protocol mandated therapy, and be followed -up per protocol.  
4.3.2 ARM B  
During the first consolidation with nab -paclitaxel  monotherapy , progression will 
be based on RECIST1.1 (see section 6.13.1 ). If there is evidence of progression 
prior to completion of 4 cycles of Consolidation On e, the patient will discontinue 
Consolidation One  early  and begin Consolidation Two. During  the second 
consolidation with pembrolizumab  monotherapy , treatment decisions will be 
based on adapted irRC (see section 6.13.2 ). All patients will be scanned prior to 
cycle 3 of pembrolizumab (after cycle 2), however in patients without symptoms 
of progression, this data will be used principally for spider -plots and hypothesis 
generation.   If symptoms of progression  are evident and  accompanied by a rapid 
decline in ECOG PS,  or that in the opinion of the investigator otherwise 
endangers the patient, it will be acceptable to discontinue protocol mandated 
therapy, and follow up patient per protocol.    
4.3.3 ARM C  
During treatment,  PD will be based on RECIST1.1 (see section 6.13.1 ). In the 
case of  PD, the patient will discontinue protocol mandated therapy, and be 
followed -up per protocol.

 6 4.4.1 Pembrolizumab Dosing Administration  for Pembrolizumab Cycles  
Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infu sion on D1 of 
each cycle it is scheduled for (see Schema ).  Sites should make every effort to 
target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, given 
the variability of infusion pumps from site to si te, a window of -5 minutes and 
+10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min). The 
Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for the preparation of the 
pembrolizumab infusion fluid and administration of infusion solution.  This 
manual is provided as a document separate from the protocol.  
 
NOTE:  Subjects should be assessed for possible Events of Clinical Interest (ECI: 
see the document provided separate from this protocol) prior to each dose. Lab 
results should be evaluated and subjects should be asked for signs and symptoms 
suggestive of an immune -related event.  Subjects who develop an ECI thought to 
be immune -related should have additional testing to rule out other etiologic 
causes.  If lab results or symptoms indicate a p ossible immune -related ECI, then 
additional testing should be performed to rule out other etiologic causes. If no 
other cause is found, then it is assumed to be immune -related.  
4.4.2 Management of  Pembrolizumab  Infusion Reactions

generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.  Refer to

4.4.3 Other Dose Modification s for Pembrolizumab  
Adverse events (both non -serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab 
exposure may represent an immunologic etiology.  These adverse events may 
occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment. 
Pembrolizumab must be withheld for drug -related toxicities and severe or life -
threatening AEs as per Table below .  See se ction 4.4.4  for supportive care 
guidelines, including use of corticosteroids.  
 
Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgical  events or 
logistical reasons not related to study therapy (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated 
medical events, patient vacation, and/or holidays). Subjects should be placed back 
on study therapy within 3 weeks of the scheduled interruption, unless otherwise

10 4.4.4 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care  for Pembrolizumab Cycles  
Supportive Care Guidelines  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed 
necessary by the treat ing investigator.  Suggested supportive care measures for the 
management of adverse events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined 
below   Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous 
treatment with corticosteroids as  well as additional anti -inflammatory agents if 
symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids.   Note that 
several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen 
when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, a ttempts should be made to 
rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, 
which might require additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines are 
intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events to b e related to 
pembrolizumab.  
 
Note:  if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the 
investigator does not need to follow the treatment guidance as outlined below . 
Refer to Section 4.4.3  for dose modification.  
 
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, 
endoscopy, or skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.  
 
Hematologic (see table in Section 4.4.3 ) 
All attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastases, sepsis 
and/or infection. Relevant diagnostic studies such as peripheral blood smear, 
reticulocyte count, LDH, haptoglobin, bone marrow biopsy or Coomb’s test, etc., 
should be considered to confirm the diagnosis.  
 
For Grade 2 events:  
 Hold pembrolizumab  
 Prednisone 1 -2 mg/kg daily may be indicated  
 Cons ider Hematology consultation  
 Permanently discontinue for inability to reduce corticosteroid dose to 10 
mg or less of prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 weeks.  
 
Grade 3 events:  
 Hematology consultation  
 Hold pembrolizumab  
 Discontinuation should be co nsidered at discretion of investigator  
 Treat with methylprednisolone 125 mg iv or prednisone 1 -2 mg/kg p.o. (or 
equivalent) as appropriate  
 Permanently discontinue for inability to reduce corticosteroid dose to 10 
mg or less of prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 weeks.

Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis 
(such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in s tool, with or without fever) 
and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).   
o All subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink 
liberal quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not 
feasible, flui d and electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.  For 
Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, consider GI consultation and endoscopy to 
confirm or rule out colitis.  
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis,  administer oral corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/coli tis, treat with intravenous steroids 
followed by high dose oral steroids.   
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.

Infusion Reaction  
See section  4.4.2   
 
4.4.5 Nab-paclitaxel Premedication  
Patients do not require premedication prior to nab -paclitaxel administration, as 
hypersensitivity reactions are rare.  
 
Administration of solvent -based taxanes (Taxol and Taxotere) requires 
premedication with corticosteroids and histamine receptor blocking agents to 
prevent the  occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions.  The solubilizing agents 
Cremophor® EL and Tween® 80 have long been implicated in adverse events 
including hypersensitivity reactions due to their detergent -like nature and known 
ability to induce histamine releas e. [30]  However, the hypersensitizing role of the 
taxane molecules themselves cannot be ruled out.   
 
In the unlikely event of a mild hypersensitivity reaction, premedication may be 
administered using the premedication regimen the institution typically uses for 
solvent based paclitaxel.  
 
In the event of a severe hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue nab -paclitaxel  (see 
section 4.4.8 ). 
4.4.6 Nab-paclitaxel  Dosing Administration for Pembrolizuma b Cycles  
Nab-paclitaxel 100mg/m2 will be infused over 30 minutes when prescribed by 
arm (see schema or time and events table).  Actual body weight will be used for 
the dose calculation.  It is not a requirement to use in -line filters during the 
administrat ion of nab -paclitaxel.  In any event, filters of pore -size less than 15 
micrometers must not  be used.  If patient body weight changes by >10%,

14 recalculate the body surface area and dose of nab -paclitaxel.  Note:  Dose changes 
will apply for the next cycle;  doses will not be changed mid - cycle.  Following 
administration, the intravenous line should be flushed with Sodium Chloride 0.9% 
solution for injection to ensure administration of the complete dose, according to 
local practices.  
4.4.7 Supportive Care Guidelines  for Nab -Paclitaxel  
Subjects should receive full supportive care during the study, including 
transfusion of blood and blood products, and treatment with antibiotics, 
antiemetics, and analgesics, as appropriate.  
 
Anti -emetic Medications  
The recommended regimen will include ondansetron 16 mg by oral, or 8 mg by 
IV route, or an alternative 5HT -3 antagonist.  Aprepitant and dexamethasone use 
are not recommended as nab -paclitaxel is not sufficiently emetogenic as to require 
aprepitant and wit hout Cremophor, dexamethasone is not required to prevent 
infusion reactions.  While not recommended, aprepitant is not prohibited --
clinicians may adjust the antiemetic regimen as needed for individual patients. 
Dexamethasone is not allowed in any study arm . 
 
Hematopoietic Growth Factors  
Use of erythropoiesis - stimulating agents (ESAs) will not be allowed on this study 
in the concurrent arm.  In ARMs A and B , they will be allowed only during nab -
paclitaxel monotherapy.  If the clinician elects to utilize ESA s, they must be used 
within FDA -approved guidelines. The use of peg -filgrastim is not allowed in this 
study.   
 
When filgrastim is used, administer filgrastim 5 mcg/kg/day (rounded to the 
nearest vial size per investigator/institution’s standard of care).  The number of 
days of filgrastim is up to the discretion of the treating MD; however, it is 
recommended that the patient must start at least 24 hours after the dose of nab -
paclitaxel and be held at least 48 hours prior to the next dose.  The dose of 
filgrastim can be adjusted based on the investigator’s discretion.  
4.4.8 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  for Nab -Paclitaxel  
See section Error! Reference source not found.  for more detailed information 
on nab -paclitaxel.  Also refer to the Full Prescribing Information for nab -
paclitaxel for complete safety information:  
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/ . If more than 2 dose 
reductions of nab -paclitaxel are required, nab -paclitaxel is to be discontinued.  
Once a patient’s dose has been reduced, the dose reduction will be permanent.  
Dose re -escalation will not be permitted.  Discontinuation of nab -paclitaxel for 
toxicity does not mandate discontinuation of pembrolizumab (in concurrent arm  
(ARM C) ; patients may continue on pembrolizumab alone; in nab -paclitaxel first 
sequential arm  (ARM B) , the patient may proceed to pembrolizumab immediately 
or once toxicity is sufficiently resolved).

 Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Hypersensitivity reactions to nab -paclitaxel rarely occur.  If they do occur, minor 
symptoms such as flushing, skin reactions, dyspnea, lower back pain, 
hypotension, or tachycardia may require temporary interruption of the infusion.  
However, severe reactions, such as hypotension requiring treatment, dyspnea 
requiring bronchodilators, angioedema or generalized urticaria require immediate 
discontinuation of nab -paclitaxel administration and aggressive symptomatic 
therapy.  Patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction to nab -
paclitaxel should not be re -challenged.

4.5 Concomitant Medications/  Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited)  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are 
not allowed during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of 
these or other medications or vaccinations specificall y prohibited during the trial, 
discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required.  The 
investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the Merck Clinical 
team.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests  with the 
investigator and/or the subject's primary physician.  No drug interactions studies 
have been conducted with nab -paclitaxel, a drug metabolized by CYP2C8 and 
CYP3A4.  Caution should be used when administering nab -paclitaxel with 
medications known to inhibit or induce either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4.   
4.5.1 Acceptable Conco mitant Medications  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a subject’s welfare 
may be administered at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the 
community standards of medical care.  All concomitant medication will be 
recor ded on the case report form (CRF) including all prescription, over -the-
counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids.  If changes 
occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and 
date may also be include d on the CRF.  
4.5.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapies during the 
Screening and Treatment Phase  
 
 Anti-cancer systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy

18  Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
 Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol  
 Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab  
 Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while 
participating in the trial.   Examples of live vaccines include, but are not 
limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, 
rabies, BCG, and typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for 
injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however 
intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. F lu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, 
and are not allowed.  
 Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms 
from an event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology.  The use 
of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may  be approved after consultation 
with the Sponsor.  
 Radiation therapy   
o Note:  Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain 
may be allowed at the investigator’s discretion.   
 Hematopoietic Growth Factors:  Use of erythropoiesis - stimulati ng agents 
(ESAs) will not be allowed on this study in the concurrent arm (ARM C). In 
the sequential arms (ARMs A and B), they will be allowed only during nab -
paclitaxel monotherapy. If the clinician elects to utilize ESAs, they must be 
used within FDA -approved guidelines. The use of peg -filgrastim is not 
allowed in this study. Filgrastim administration is allowed with single -agent 
nab-paclitaxel but not with pembro lizumab (see section 4.4.8 ). 
Subjects who, in the assessment by the investigator, require the use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the 
trial.  Subjects may receive other medications that t he investigator deems to be 
medically necessary  
4.6 Duration of Therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to AEs, treatment may continue until the 
end of study -defined treatment or until:  
 Inter -current illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
 Unacceptable toxicity  
 Pregnancy  
 Patient decides to withdraw from study treatment, OR 
 General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the 
patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the 
investigator.

19 4.7 Duration of Fo llow-Up 
After two years of follow -up as described in the time and events table, subsequent 
follow -up will be per standard of care and the study will follow only for 
progression and for survival for up to 3 additional years, for a total of 5 years of 
follow -up after study completion.  
4.8 Removal of Patients from Protocol Therapy  
Patients will be removed from protocol therapy and the PI notified when any of 
the criteria listed in section  4.6 apply.  The reason for discontinuation of protocol 
therapy will be documented on the electronic case report form ( eCRF ).   
 
In case a patient decides to prematurely discontinue protocol therapy (“refuses  
treatment”), th e patient should be asked if she or he may still be contacted for 
further scheduled study assessments. The outcome of that discussion should be 
documented in both the medical records and in the eCRF.  
4.9 Study Withdrawal  
Patients will be removed from protocol therapy and the PI notified when any of 
the criteria listed in section 4.7 apply.  The reason for discontinuation of protocol 
therapy will be documented on the eCRF.    
 
If a patient decides to withdraw  from the study (and not just from protocol 
therapy)  an effort should be made to complete and report study  assessments as 
thoroughly as possible .  At the time of withdrawal, t he investigator should attempt 
to establish as completely as  possible the reason for the study withdrawal.  
 The patient should be asked if they are willing to allow for the abstraction 
of relevant information from their medical record in order to meet the long 
term follow up (e.g., survival) objectives outlined in the  protocol.   
 A complete final evaluation at t he time of the patient’s study withdrawal 
should be obtained with an explanation of why the patient is withdrawing 
from the study.   
 If the patient is noncompliant and does not return for an end of study

20 5.0 DRUG INFORMATION  
 
5.1 Pembrolizumab  
Product description : 
Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction 
between PD -1 and its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2. Pembrolizumab is an IgG4 
kappa immunoglobulin with an approximate molecular weight of 149 kDa.  
 
Mechanism of action : 
Binding of the PD -1 ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2, to the PD -1 receptor found on T 
cells, inhibits T -cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD -1 
ligands occurs in some tumors. Signaling through this pathway can contribute to 
inhibition of active T -cell immune surveillance of tumors. Pembrolizumab is a 
monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD -1 receptor and blocks it s interaction 
with PD -L1 and PD -L2, releasing PD -1 pathway -mediated inhibition of the 
immune response, including antitumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse 
tumor models, blocking PD -1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth.  
 
Supplier/How Supplied : 
Pembrolizumab will be provided at no cost to the study patient by Merck, the 
manufacturer of the drug. Clinical supplies will be affixed with a clinical label in 
accordance with regulatory requirements.  
 
This trial is open -label; therefore, the subject, th e trial site personnel, the Sponsor 
and/or designee are not blinded to treatment. Drug identity (name, strength) is 
included in the label text; random code/disclosure envelopes or lists are not 
provided.  
 
Pembrolizumab is supplied as single -use 100 mg vials containing a sterile, non -
pyrogenic, clear to opalescent aqueous solution (25 mg/mL) , or as single -use 5 0 
mg vials containing lyophilized powder in a single -dose vial for reconstitution ). 
Pembrolizumab  solution for infusion is formulated in 10mM hist idine buffer, pH 
5.2-5.8, containing 7% sucrose and 0.02% polysorbate 80, supplied in Type I 
glass vials with a cap color of red, salmon, or blue.  
 
Preparation:  
Pembrolizumab  solution for infusion must be diluted prior to administration  per 
institutional guidelines . Allow the required number of vials to equilibrate to room 
temperature. Do not shake the vials. Do not use if opaque or extraneous 
particulate matter other than translucent to white proteinaceous particles is 
observed. Do not use if discolored. To prepare the infusion solution add the dose 
volume of pembrolizumab  to an infusion bag containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride 
Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP. Gently invert the bag 10 -15 times

Administer prepared solutions immediately after preparation. If not administered 
immediately, prepared solutions may be stored refrig erated for up to 2 4 hours. 
Pembrolizumab  solutions may be stored at room temperature for a cumulative 
time of up to 6  hours. This includes room temperature storage of liquid drug 
product solution in vials, room temperature storage of infusion solution in t he IV 
bag, and the duration of infusion.  
 
Dose and route of administration : 
The recommended dose of pembrolizumab is 200 mg administered as an IV 
infusion over approximately 30 minutes (range: 25 - 40 minutes) every 3 weeks 
until disease progression or un acceptable toxicity. Pembrolizumab should be 
administered using an infusion set containing a low -protein binding 0.2 to 5 μm 
in-line filter made of polyethersulfone or polysulfone . Infusion rate should not 
exceed 6.7 mL/min. A central line is not required;  however if a subject has a 
central venous catheter in place, it is recommended that it be used for the infusion. 
Do not co -administer other drugs through the same infusion line. Following the 
infusion, flush the IV line with normal saline.

Other Immune -Mediated Adverse Reactions  
Other clinically important immune -mediated AEs can occur. The following 
clinically significant, immune -mediated AEs occurred in less than 1% of patients 
treated with pembrolizumab, including exfoliative dermatitis, uveitis, arthritis, 
myositis,  Guillain -Barré syndrome, vasculitis, myasthenia gravis, pancreatitis, 
hemolytic anemia, partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammato ry foci in 
brain parenchyma . 
 
Infusion -related Reactions  
Infusion -related reactions  have been reported in 0.1% of patients receiving 
pembrolizumab in clinical trials.  Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of 
infusion -related reactions inc luding rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, 
rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever.  
 
Steven’s Johnson Syndrom e (SJS)  and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis  (TEN)  
The risk  of SJS and TEN is reported at approximately 0.4 – 7 cases per million 
patient years  in the general adult population. Independent risk factors include 
certain medications such as anticonvulsants, sulfonamides, aminopenicillins, 
allopurinol, and NSAIDs. Non -medication triggers include infection, contrast 
media, and vaccinations. Malignancy  is associated with an increased mortality 
rate in patients with SJS and TEN.  
 
Myocarditis  
A total of 6 cases of myocarditis have been reported in patients treated with 
pembrolizumab in clinical trials in an expanded access program. There was one 
fatal cas e reported in a clinical trial 60.  Immune -mediated myocarditis should be 
suspected if other causes of myocarditis, such as infection or prior radiation 
therapy have been excluded. Risk factors include certain medications and 
treatment modalities such as radiation, anthracyc line, alkylating agents and most 
recently checkpoint inhibitors.  
 
Embryofetal Toxicity  
Based on its mechanism of action, pembrolizumab may cause fetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman. Animal models link the PD -1/PDL -1 
signaling pathway with main tenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal 
immune tolerance to fetal tissue.

5.1.1 Contraindications  
There are no reported contraindications associated wit h the use of 
pembrolizumab.  
 
Pembrolizumab may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero.  Furthermore, it is 
not known if pembrolizumab has transient adverse  effects on the composition of 
sperm.   
5.1.2 Contraception  
Pembrolizumab may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero.  Furthermore, it is 
not known if pembrolizumab has transient adverse effects on the composition of 
sperm.   
 
For this trial, male subjects will be considered to be of non -reproductive potential 
if they have azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an 
underlying medical condition).   
 
Female subjects will be considered of non -reproductive potential if they are 
either:  
(1) postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no men ses without an 
alternative medical cause; in women < 45 years of age a high follicle 
stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to 
confirm a post -menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception 
or hormonal replacemen t therapy. In the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, 
a single FSH measurement is insufficient.);  
OR 
(2) have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy or bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion, at least 6 weeks prior to 
screen ing;  
OR 
(3) has a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing.  
 
Female and male subjects of reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming 
pregnant or impregnating a partner, respectively, while receiving study drug and 
for 120 days after the last dose of study drug by complying with one of the 
following:   
(1) pr actice abstinence† from heterosexual activity;  
LCCC 1516   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Jared Weiss, MD   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Amendment 4    May 23 , 2018  
 
25 OR 
(2) use (or have their partner use) acceptable contraception during heterosexual 
activity.   
 
Acceptable methods of contraception are‡: 
Single method (one of the following is acceptable):  
• intrauterine de vice (IUD)  
• vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner  
• contraceptive rod implanted into the skin  
 
Combination method (requires use of two of the following):  
• diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical 
cap/spermicide)  
• cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)   
• contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only)  
• male condom or female condom (cannot be used together)  
• hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pill (estrogen/progestin pill or 
progestin -only pil l), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, 
or subcutaneous contraceptive injection . 
 
†Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of 
contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject’s preferred an d usual 
lifestyle and if considered acceptable by local regulatory agencies and 
ERCs/IRBs.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto -thermal, 
post-ovulation methods, etc.) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception.  
 
‡If a co ntraceptive method listed above is restricted by local 
regulations/guidelines, then it does not qualify as an acceptable method of 
contraception for subjects participating at sites in this country/region.  
 
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve 
unknown risks to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the 
study.  In order to participate in the study subjects of childbearing potential must 
adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) from the da y of study 
medication initiation (or 14 days prior to the initiation of study medication for 
oral contraception) throughout the study period up to 120 days after the last dose 
of trial therapy.  If there is any question that a subject of childbearing poten tial 
will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that subject 
should not be entered into the study.  
5.1.3 Use in Pregnancy  
If a subject inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with 
pembrolizumab, the subject will immediately be re moved from the study.  The 
site will contact the subject at least monthly and document the subject’s status 
until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  The outcome of the 
LCCC 1516   CONFIDENTIAL

24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to Merck if the outcome is a 
serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other 
disabling or life -threatening complication to the mother or newborn).   
 
The study investig ator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the 
outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the 
Sponsor.   If a male subject impregnates his female partner the study personnel at 
the site must be informed imm ediately and reported  to the Sponsor and Merck as 
described above .  
 
See section 7.3.3  for detailed information on reporting of suspected pregnancie s, 
pregnancies, and outcome of any pregnancy to the UNCCN Project Manager , 
Merck, and Celgene.  
 
Male Subjects  
Male patients treated with nab-paclitaxel are advised not to father a child during 
and up to 6 months after treatment.  
5.1.4 Use in Nursing Women  
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is excreted in human milk.  Since many 
drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse 
reactions in the nursing infant, subjects who are breast -feeding are not eligible for 
enrollment.  
5.1.5 Overd ose of Pembrolizumab  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any 
dose of 1,000 mg or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific 
information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. 
Appropriate  supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  In the 
event of overdose, the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  
Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
 
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a Merck 
product, the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no 
other seriousness criteria are met.  
 
If a dose of Merck’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is ta ken 
without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the 
overdose is reported as a non -serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the 
terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”  
All reports of overd ose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 
24 hours to the UNCCN Project Manager who will report the event within 2 
working days hours to Merck Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety;

27 5.2 Nab-paclitaxel ( Abraxane®; ABI -007) 
Nab-paclitaxel is a protein -bound form of paclitaxel indicated in the United States 
for the treatment of breast cance r after failure of combination chemotherapy for 
metastatic disease or relapse within 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy.  Prior 
therapy should have included an anthracycline unless clinically contraindicated.  
It is also indicated for locally advanced or me tastatic NSCLC as first -line 
treatment in combination with carboplatin in patients who are not candidates for 
curative surgery or radiation therapy.  See: 
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/ scripts/cder/drugsatfda/  
for additional information, and the nab -paclitaxel investigator’s brochure for 
complete information.   
5.2.1 Packaging, Label ing, Storage and Supply of nab -paclitaxel  
Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) will be supplied by Celgene Corporation, in single -
use vials  at no cost to the patient .  Each single -use 50 mL vial will contain 
paclitaxel (100 mg) and human albumin (HA; approximately 900 mg).  
Commercial drug will be supplied.  Each milliliter (mL) of reconstituted 
suspension contains 5 mg pac litaxel.  Un -reconstituted nab -paclitaxel 
(Abraxane®) should be stored at controlled room temperature (20  to 25C or 68 
to 77F) in its original carton to protect from bright light. Unopened vials are 
stable until the date indicated on the package when s tored between 20°C to 25°C 
(68°F to 77°F), in the original package.  Neither freezing nor refrigeration 
adversely affects the stability of the product.  
 
Reconstituted nab -paclitaxel (Abraxane®) should be used immediately.  If not 
used immediately, the vial  of reconstituted nab -paclitaxel (Abraxane®) must be 
placed in its carton in a refrigerator at 2  to 8C (36 to 46F) for a maximum of 8 
hours.  If not used immediately, each vial of reconstituted suspension should be 
replaced in the original carton to pr otect it from bright light.  Discard any unused 
portion.  Both forms should be stored in an area free of environmental extremes 
and must be accessible only to study personnel.  
 
Temperature records for nab -paclitaxel (Abraxane®) must be kept for verificati on 
of proper study drug storage.  
 
If storing reconstituted nab -paclitaxel (Abraxane®), some settling may occur. 
Ensure complete re -suspension by mild agitation prior to use.  
 
The suspension for infusion prepared as recommended in an infusion bag should 
be used immediately, but may be stored at ambient temperature (approximately 
25°C) and lighting conditions for up to 4 hours.   
5.2.2 Reconstitution of nab -paclitaxel  
Nab-paclitaxel will be reconstituted by appropriate study personnel and 
administered to the patien t in the study site setting at weekly intervals.  The 
LCCC 1516   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Jared Weiss, MD   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Amendment 4    May 23 , 2018  
 
28 investigator will calculate the body surface area (BSA) of the patient in order to 
determine the total amount of nab -paclitaxel to be administered.  
 Reconstitution and use of nab -paclitaxel:  
1. Calculate t he patient’s body surface area at the beginning of the study and 
if the weight changes by >10%.  
2. Calculate the total dose (in mg) to be administered by:  
Total Dose (mg) = BSA x (study dose mg/m2) 
3. Calculate the total number of vials required by:  
Total Numb er of Vials =  Total Dose (mg)  
    100 mg/vial  
 
Round up the number of vials to be reconstituted to the next higher whole 
number when a fractional number of vials is obtained by the above 
formula (e.g., if the total number of vials = 4.05 or 4.5, then 5 vi als would 
be reconstituted).  
4. Using sterile technique, prepare the vials for reconstitution.  
5. Swab the rubber stoppers with alcohol.  
6. Reconstitute each nab -paclitaxel ( Abraxane® ) vial by injecting 20 mL of 
0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or equivalent in to each vial over a 
period of not less than 1 minute (Note: change the syringes after 
reconstituting every 3 vials).  
 Slowly  inject the 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, 
over a minimum of 1 minute , using the sterile syringe directing 
the solution flow onto the inside wall  of the vial.  
 DO NOT INJECT  the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 
solution directly onto the lyophilized cake as this will result in 
foaming.  
 Once the injection is complete, allo w the vial to sit for a minimum 
of 5 minutes  to ensure proper wetting of the lyophilized 
cake/powder.   
 Gently  swirl and/or invert the vial slowly  for at least 2 minutes  
until complete dissolution of any cake/powder occurs.  Avoid 
generation of foam. Rapid  agitation or shaking will result in 
foaming.  
 If foaming or clumping occurs, stand solution for at least 15 
minutes until foam subsides.  
 Each mL of reconstituted product will contain 5 mg of paclitaxel.  
7. Calculate the exact total dosing volume of 5 mg/mL su spension required 
for the patient:  Dosing volume (mL) = total dose (mg)/5 (mg/mL)  
8. The reconstituted sample should be milky and homogeneous without 
visible particulates.  If particulates or settling are visible, the vial should 
be gently  inverted again to ensure complete resuspension, prior to use. 
Discard the reconstituted suspension if precipitates are observed.

29 9. Once the exact volume  of reconstituted Abraxane® has been withdrawn 
from the vials, discard any excess solution left over in accordance with 
standard operating procedures.  
10. Further dilution is not necessary. Inject the calculated dosing volume of 
reconstituted Abraxane® suspension into an empty sterile, standard PVC 
IV bag using an injection port.  Inject perpendicularly into the center of 
the inje ction port to avoid dislodging plastic material into the IV bag.  
11. Administer the calculated dosing volume of reconstituted Abraxane® 
suspension by IV infusion over 30 minutes.  The use of in -line filters is 
not recommended because the reconstituted solution  may clog the filter.  
12. Following administration, the intravenous line should be flushed with 
Sodium Chloride 0.9% solution for injection to ensure administration of 
the complete dose, according to local practices.  
5.2.3 Dose and Schedule of nab -paclitaxel  
See Schema.  
5.2.4 Administration  
Nab-paclitaxel will be infused intravenously over 30 minutes. Actual body weight 
will be used for the calculation.   
 
NOTE: It is not a requirement to use filter needles in the preparation of, or in -line 
filters during the administratio n of nab -paclitaxel. In any event, filters of pore -size 
less than 15 micrometers must not be used.

locally advanced breast cancer for 12 doses, no grade 4 nab -paclitaxel adverse 
events were reported.  The most common (% of patients) nab -paclitaxel -related 
adverse events inclu ded neutropenia (grade 2: 6%, grade 3: 3%), febrile 
neutropenia (grade 3: 2%), fatigue (grade 2: 26%, grade 3:6%) neuropathy (grade 
2: 11%, grade 3: 5%), nausea (grade 2: 10%), vomiting (grade 2: 8% , grade 3: 
2%), and diarrhea (grade 2: 9%, grade 3: 5%). Dose reductions or omissions were 
required in 14 (2%) of doses [31].

The following adverse events are associated with nab -paclitaxel when studied in 
metastatic breast cancer:  
 
Hematologic :  Myelosuppression, primarily neutropenia, is dose dependent and 
reversible, but dose  limiting.  Thrombocytopenia is uncommon, while anemia 
occurred in 33% (severe in <1%) of patients in the randomized trial.     
 
Infections :  Infectious episodes were reported in 24% of patients in the 
randomized phase III trial in metastatic breast cancer .   
 
Hypersensitivity : Hypersensitivity reactions (Grade 1 or 2) occurred on the day of 
nab-paclitaxel administration in the randomized phase III trial in metastatic breast 
cancer and consisted of dyspnea (1%) and flushing, hypotension, chest pain, and 
arrhythmias (all <1%).   
 
Cardiovascular :  Hypotension occurred in 5% and bradycardia (during the 
infusion) in <1% of patients in the randomized Phase III trial.  Severe 
cardiovascular events possibly related to nab -paclitaxel occurred in approximately 
3%, and included cardiac is chemia/infarction, chest pain, cardiac arrest, 
supraventricular tachycardia, edema, thrombosis, pulmonary thromboembolism, 
pulmonary emboli, and hypertension.  Strokes and TIAs have been reported.  
 
ECG abnormalities : occurred in 35% of patients who had a n ormal ECG at 
baseline in the randomized Phase III trial in metastatic breast cancer.  
 
Respiratory :  Following treatment with nab -paclitaxel, dyspnea (12%), cough 
(7%) and pneumothorax (<1%) were reported in the randomized Phase III trial in 
metastatic brea st cancer.   
 
Neurologic:  Sensory neuropathy occurs frequently with nab -paclitaxel (71% in 
the randomized clinical trial, 10% severe).  It is dose -dependent, and increases 
with cumulative dose.   
 
Vision :  Ocular/visual disturbances occurred in 13%; 1% were severe and 
included keratitis and blurred vision.   
 
Arthralgia/Myalgia :  Symptoms occurred in 44% of patients in the randomized 
clinical trial (8% of patients experienced severe symptoms).  
 
Hepatic :  Exposure and toxicity of paclitaxel can be increased with hepatic 
impairment.  Grade 3 or 4 elevations in GGT occurred in 14% of patients in the 
randomized Phase III trial.  
 
Renal :  Elevated serum creatinine occurred in 11% (1% severe) of patients in the 
randomized Phase III trial.

General Toxicity Information  
 
Drug Interactions: No drug interactions studies have been conducted with nab -
paclitaxel, a drug metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4.  Caution should be used 
when administering nab -paclitaxel with medic ations known to inhibit or induce 
either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4.   
 
Injection site reactions:  These reactions occur infrequently with nab -paclitaxel 
and were mild in the randomized clinical trial.  
 
Use in patients with hepatic impairment: The starting dose of n ab-paclitaxel 
should be reduced for patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment.   
 
Use in pregnancy: Nab-paclitaxel is pregnancy category D.   Men should also be 
advised not to father a child while receiving treatment with nab -paclitaxel.    
 
Albumin: Nab-paclitaxel contains human albumin, and thus carries an extremely 
remote risk for transmission of viral diseases, and Creutzfeldt -Jakob Disease.    
 
Other potential risks associated with nab -paclitaxel include mucositis, 
bilirubin/liver enzyme e levations, edema, alopecia, asthenia, nail changes, 
dehydration and pyrexia.  
 
See the nab -paclitaxel prescribing information and investigator’s brochure for 
additional information on post -marketing toxicities reported with nab -paclitaxel.   
5.2.7 Overdose of Na b-paclitaxel  
Overdose, as defined for this protocol section 5.2.7 , refers to nab -paclitaxel 
dosing only.   
 
On a per dose basis, an overdose is def ined as the following amount over the 
protocol -specified dose of nab -paclitaxel assigned to a given patient, regardless of 
any associated adverse events or sequelae.  
 
PO any amount over the protocol -specified dose  
 
IV 10% over the protocol -specified dose   
 
SC 10% over the protocol -specified dose  
 
On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as anything more 
frequent than the protocol required schedule or frequency.   
 
On an infusion rate basis, an overdose is defined as any rate faster than the  
protocol -specified rate.  For nab-paclitaxel, an infusion completed in less than 25 
LCCC 1516   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Jared Weiss, MD   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Amendment 4    May 23 , 2018  
 
33 minutes may increase Cmax by approximately 20%, therefore a nab-paclitaxel 
infusion completed in less than 25 minutes will meet the infusion rate criterion for 
an overdose . 
 
Complete data about drug administration, including any overdose, regardless of 
whether the overdose was accidental or intentional, should be reported on the 
eCRF and to Celgene Global Drug Safety and Risk Management (FAX 908 -673-
9115; see section 7.3.3 ).

1Unless otherwise noted, screening evaluations to take place within 2 weeks of day 1 of study treatment.  
Archival tissue must be made available . 
 
2Laboratory evaluations on day 1 of cycle 1 need be repeated only if >7 days have elapsed between 
screening laboratory tests and day 1.  
 
3A window of +/ - 3 days will apply to each cycle.    
   
4Patients may begin n ab-paclitaxel earlier if they experience progression during initial consolidation with 
pembrolizumab. NOTE:  post-pembrolizumab, an optional tumor biopsy will be requested in up to 12 
patients in ARM A only.  See section 6.11.2  and the laboratory manual for additional details.  
 
5The end of treatment visit should only occur when patients permanently stop study treatment and should 
be performed 30 days (+/-7 days) after the last dose of treatment. All adverse events and concomitant 
medications should be followed up until the 30 -day End of Treatment (EOT) visit. Patients who have an 
ongoing ≥grade 2 or serious AE (SAE) at the EOT will continue to be follo wed until the event is resolved 
or deemed irreversible by the investigator. Repeat tumor imaging at this visit required.  
 
6Long -term follow -up visits will take place per standard of care every 2 (preferred) to 3 months  (depending 
on insurance coverage)  for 24 months and will include radiographic tumor evaluation.   After 24 months, 
patient will be followed -up per standard of care (SOC), with documentation in the eCRF limited to 
progression and survival noted at their S OC MD visits for up to 5 years.

50 6.11.1  Archival Tissue  for ARMS A -C 
Archival  tumor tissue form the patient’s original diagnostic biopsy will be 
requested and collected from all enrolled patients.  See accompanying laboratory 
manual for additional details.  
6.11.2  Research Biopsies for ARM A   
Twelve patients who demonstrate regression of d isease (tumor shrinkage > 30%) 
after 3 months of pembrolizumab monotherapy  and consent to optional biopsy  
(only applies to subjects enrolled at UNC ) will undergo repeat biopsy for further 
analysis of biocorrelatives; see laboratory manual for additional details.  
 
Three (3)  twenty -gauge core biopsies and 3 fine needle aspirates (FNA) will be 
the goal.  Ultimately, the ratio of FNA/core biopsies will be  up to the discretion of 
the physician performing the procedure , with primary consideration being safety .    
Additional details regarding processing, storing and handling tissue will be 
provided in a separate laboratory manual.    
  
Biological samples colle cted for the study will be stored at the research 
laboratories at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC), University 
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC until the completion of the study.   With 
patient consent, any remaining tumor tissue after protocol specific studies are 
complete will be stored for future research concerning lung cancer.  
 
Risks associated with lung FNAs and biopsies include the following:  
 Likely: local discomfort and minor bleeding  
 Less likely: pneumothorax, hemothorax, intrap arenchymal hemorrhage, 
hemoptysis, bronchopleural fistula, air embolism, and vascular injury  
 
Prior to the procedure, the physician performing the procedure will discuss the 
risks with each study participant and answer any questions.   Patients receiving 
therapeutic anticoagulation, with abnormal coagulation studies, or 
thrombocytopenia (defined as platelet count <50,000) will not undergo biopsy 
until and unless these resolve because of the increased risk of potential 
complications under these circumstances.   After lung biopsies, patients will be 
observed for approximately 4 hours (range 4 -6 hours) after the procedure, or per 
institutional standard guidelines.  Less than the goal quantity of tissue is 
acceptable for each type of biopsy, and will be left to th e clinical judgment of the 
physician performing the procedure.

6.12 Assessment of Safety  
Any patient who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity.  
Each patient will be assessed periodically fo r the development of any toxicity 
according to the Time and Events table (section 6.0).  Toxicity will be assessed 
according to the NCI CTCAE v4. Toxicities will be characterized in terms 
regarding seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action taken  with regard to 
trial treatment.  
 
For sub jects receiving treatment with p embrolizumab all AEs of un known 
etiology associated with p embrolizumab exposure should be evaluated to 
determine if it is possibly an event of clinical interest (ECI) of a potentially  
immunologic etiology (termed immune -related adverse events, or irAEs); see the  
separate ECI guidance document  (provided as a document separate from this 
protocol) regarding the identification, evaluation and management of potential 
irAEs.   
 
Please refer to section  7.2  detailed information regarding the assessment and 
recording of AEs.   
6.13 Assessment of Efficacy  
Patients who have receive d at least 1 dose of nab-paclitaxel or pembrolizumab  
will be evaluable for assessment of response  and progression .   Patients whose 
cancer growth is documented by physical examination  without imaging  
confirmation will count as progression.   
6.13.1  Assessment of Disease -Tumor Measurement Based on RECIST 1.1  
  Measurable disease will be defined as the presence of at least one measurable 
lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with the longest 
diameter a minimum size of:  
 >10mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)  
 10mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -
measurable).  
 20 mm by chest x -ray. 
 
For malignant lymph nodes to be considered pathologically enl arged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥15mm in short axis when assessed by CT 
scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5mm).  At 
baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.   
 
LCCC 1516   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Jared Weiss, MD   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Amendment 4    May 23 , 2018  
 
52 All other lesions,  including small lesions (longest diameter <10mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis) as well as truly non -
measurable lesions, will be considered non -measurable.  Lesions considered truly 
non-measurable include:leptomeningeal disease;  ascites; pleural/pericardial 
effusion; inflammatory breast disease; lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, 
abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is 
not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.  
 
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if 
clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as 
possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning 
of the treatment.  The same method of as sessment and the same technique should 
be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during 
follow -up.  Imaging based evaluation should always be done rather than clinical 
examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot  be imaged but are 
assessable by clinical exam.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable 
when they are superficial and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. 
skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photogra phy 
including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesions is recommended.  
 
Baseline Documentation of Target and Non -Target Lesions   
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of 
two lesions per organ) representative of all inv olved organs should be identified 
as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline.   
 
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longer 
diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition  should be those 
that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  
 
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
diameters. If lym ph nodes are to be included in the sum, only the short axis is 
added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of 
the disease.  
 
All other lesions (or  sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should 
be identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. In 
subsequent assessments, non-index  lesions will be recorded as “stable or 
decreased disease,” “absent,” or “progress ion.”  
 
Evaluation of Target Lesions using RECIST 1.1 Criteria  
Complete response (CR) −Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph node (LN) (whether target or non -target) must have decreased in short axis 
to <10mm.  
 
LCCC 1516   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Jared Weiss, MD   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Amendment 4    May 23 , 2018  
 
53 Partial response (PR) −At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of the target 
lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD )−At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of the 
target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since th e 
treatment started including baseline if that is the smallest on study.  In addition to 
the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase 
of at least 5mm.  The appearance of one or more new lesions also constitutes PD.  
 
Stable disease (SD)− Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD since the 
treatment started.  
 
Nonprogressive disease : Measurable disease is not required for this study.  
Patients with CR at the time of study entry or otherwise nonmeasurable disease 
will be assessed for progression.  In the event of PD, this should be noted.   In the 
absence of meeting criteria for progression, nonprogressive disease should be 
coded (NPD).  
 
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions using RECIST 1.1 Criteria  
Complete response (CR)− Disappearance of all non -target.  All LN must be non -
pathological in size (<10mm short axis).   
 
Non-complete response (non -CR)/non -progression (non -PD)−Persistence of one 
or more non -target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the 
normal limits.  
 
Progressive disease (PD) −Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions.  
6.13.2  irRC for this study  (Adapted from  [32, 33]   
New measurable lesions in  irRC:  
New measura ble lesions will not necessarily constitute PD or preclude partial 
response ( PR).  Rather, the difference between the current size of a measurable 
lesions and its size prior to meet ing criteria for measurability will be added to the 
sum of tumor measuremen ts.  
 
Definition of  Response Using  irRC  
 irComplete Response (irCR):  Complete disappearance of all lesions 
(whether measurable or not) and no new lesions .  Lymph nodes must 
decrease to <10mm.   It is the judgment of the investigator whether a 
nonmeasurable radiographic nodule is likely cancerous; only nodules felt 
likely cancerous will preclude the judgement of irCR.

baseli ne (or, for the case of measurement of response for individual 
sequenced treatments, from the beginning of that treatment) , of 30% or 
greater i n the sum of the longest diameter of all index lesions plus new 
measurable lesions.  The appearance of new measur able lesions is factored 
into the overall tumor burden, but does not automatically qualify as 
progressive disease .   
 
 irStable Disease (irSD):  Does not meet criteria for irCR or irPR, in the  
absence of PD.  
 
 irProgressive Disease (irPD):  At least 2 0% increa se in tumor b urden  (i.e., 
taking sum of the longest diameter of all index  lesions and any new ly 
measurable  lesions) when compared to disease burden  at nadir; m inimum 
5mm absolute increase in tumor burden  required .  The investigator may 
assign the designation of irPD for massive and unequivocal worsening of 
non-target lesions alone.  
 
 Nonprogressive disease:  Measurable disease is not required for this study.  
Patients with CR at the time of study entry or otherwise nonmeasurable 
disease will be assessed for progression.  In the event of PD, this shoul d be 
noted.  In the absence of meeting criteria for progres sion, nonprogressive 
disease should be coded (NPD).  
 
Immmune -related Best Overall Response (irBOR):  
IrBOR is the best response observed during the relevant time period.  Of not e, 
when total tumor burden increases and the patient is maintained on therapy, and 
tumor then shrinks (pseudo -progression) the second measurement will be utilized.  
 
Designation of pseudo -progression:  
The phenomenon of pseudo -progression is of particular interest in this trial. For 
the purpose of this trial, pseudo -progression will b e defined as any > 10% 
increase in tumor burden followed by a > 10% decrease in tumor burden prior  to 
change in therapy.   Such occur rences  will be noted for the purpose of exploratory 
hypothesis -generating analyses.

55 7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Definitions  
7.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., an abnormal 
laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
drug) in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutica l 
product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a med icinal product, whether or not related to the 
medicinal product.   
 
Hospitalization for elective surgery or routine clinical procedures that are not the 
result of an AE (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) need not be considered 
AEs and should not be  recorded as an AE.  Disease progression should not be 
recorded as an AE, unless it is attributable by the investigator to the study therapy.  
 
All adverse events that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment 
must be reported by the investigator if they cause the subject to be excluded from 
the trial, or are the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not 
limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or 
a procedure.  
 
From the time o f treatment through 30 days following cessation of treatment, all 
adverse events must be reported by the investigator. Such events will be recorded 
at each examination on the Adverse Event case report forms/worksheets.  The 
reporting timeframe for adverse events meeting any serious criteria is described in 
section 7.1.4 . The investigator will make every attempt to follow all subjects with 
non-serious  adverse events for outcome.  
 
Adverse events will not be collected for subjects during the pre -screening period 
(for determination of archival tissue status) as long as that subject has not 
undergone any protocol -specified procedure or intervention.  If th e subject 
requires a blood draw, fresh tumor biopsy etc., the subject is first required to 
provide consent to the main study and AEs will be captured according to 
guidelines for standard AE reporting.  
 
 
7.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a reasonable 
possibility  that the drug is the cause.   Reasonable possibility  means that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  A 
LCCC 1516   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Jared Weiss, MD   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Amendment 4    May 23 , 2018  
 
56 suspected adverse re action implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
 
Causality assessment to a study drug is a medical judgment made in consideration 
of the following factors: temporal relati onship of the AE to study drug exposure, 
known mechanism of action or side effect profile of study treatment, other recent 
or concomitant drug exposures, normal clinical course of the disease under 
investigation, and any other underlying or concurrent medi cal conditions.  Other 
factors to consider in considering drug as the cause of the AE:  
 Single occurrence of an uncommon event known to be strongly associated 
with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson 
Syndrome)  
 One or more occurr ences of an event not commonly associated with drug 
exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the population (e.g., tendon 
rupture); often more than once occurrence from one or multiple studies 
would be needed before the sponsor could determine that there is 
reasonable possibility  that the drug caused the event.   
 An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial that 
indicates the events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group 
than in a concurrent or historical control group.  
7.1.3 Unexpe cted AE or SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered unexpected if  the specificity or severity of it is not 
consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure 
(IB) for an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of 
product characteristics for an approved product).  Unexpected also refers to AEs 
or SARs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not 
specifically mentioned as  occurring with the particular drug under investigation.   
7.1.4 Serious AE or SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes : 
 Death;  
 Is life -threatening (places the subje ct at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred);  
 Requires inpatient hospitalization (>24 hours) or prolongation of 
existing hospitalization*  
 Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
 Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or subst antial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions;  
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious 
adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medic al 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require

57 medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
in the definition.  For reporting purposes, also consider the occurrences 
of pregnancy as an event which must be reported as an important 
medical event.  
 
*Hospitalization for anticipated or protocol specified procedures such as 
administration of chemotherapy, central line insertion, metastasis interventional 
therapy, resection of primary tumor, or elective surgery, w ill not be considered 
serious adverse events.  
 Note: In addition to the above criteria, adverse events meeting either of 
the below criteria, although not serious per ICH definition, are 
reportable to the Merck in the same timeframe as SAEs to meet certain 
local requirements. Therefore, these events are considered serious by 
Merck for collection purposes.  
● Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study);  
● Is associated with an overdose.  
 
For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until tr eatment , 
any serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious adverse event, including death 
due to any cause other than progression of the cancer under study that occurs to 
any subject must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 w orking 
days to Merck Global Safety if it causes the subject to be excluded from the trial, 
or is the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not limited to 
washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a 
procedu re. 
For the time period beginning at treatment through 90 days following cessation of 
treatment, or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the subject initiates new 
anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, any serious adverse event, or follow up to 
a serious adverse event, including death due to any cause other than progression 
of the cancer under study whether or not related to the Merck product, must be 
reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to Merck 
Global Safety.  
Additio nally, any serious adverse event, considered by an investigator who is a 
qualified physician to be related to Merck product that is brought to the attention 
of the investigator at any time following consent through the end of the specified 
safety follow -up period specified in the paragraph above, or at any time outside of 
the time period specified in the previous paragraph also must be reported 
immediately to the Sponsor and to Merck Global Safety.  
All subjects with serious adverse events must be followed u p for outcome.  
SAE reports and any other relevant safety information are to be forwarded to 
the Merck Global Safety facsimile number:  +1 -215-993-1220

For non-serious  AEs or SARs, documentation must begin from signing of the 
informed consent and continue through the 30 day follow -up period after 
treatment is discontinued.   
 
Collected information should be recorded in the eCRF  for that patient.  Please 
include a description of the event, its severity or toxicity  grade, onset and resolved 
dates (if applicable), and the relationship to the study drug.    Documentation 
should occur at least monthly.  
7.3 SAEs or Serious SARs and Events of Clinical Interest  
7.3.1 Timing  
All SAEs from the time of the signing of the informed con sent document until 90 
days after the last dose of study drug (or to the initiation of new anti -cancer 
treatment, whichever is earliest) will be documented and reported to Celgene  and 
to Merck (see details on reporting in Section 7.3.3 )  
7.3.2 Documentation and Notification  
SAEs or Serious SARs must be recorded in the SAE console within Oncore™ for 
that patient within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence .  Additionally,  the 
NCCN Project Manager must also be notified via email of all SAEs within 24 
hours of learning of its occurrence.   
 
7.3.3 Reporting of SAEs, Events of Clinical Interest, Pregnancies  and Overdoses  
IRB Reporting Requirements:  
UNC : 
 The UNC -IRB will be notified of all SAEs that qualify as an 
Unanticipated Problem as per the UNC IRB Policies using the IRB’s web -
based reporting system (see section 9.5.3) within 7 days of the Investigator 
becoming aware of the problem.   
 
Affiliate sites :   
 For affiliate sites using a local IRB of record, please submit adverse events 
per local IRB policy.  
Any SAEs that qualify as an Unanticipated Problem will be entered into 
Oncore and reported to the UNC IRB by the UNC Research Personnel  
using the IRB’s web-based reporting system (see section 9.5.3) within 7 
days of the Investigator becoming aware of the problem.   
 
Pregnanc ies (Information for Reporting to Merck)  
Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered adverse events, it is the 
responsibility  of investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy or

Amendment 4    May 23 , 2018  
 
59 lactation in a subject (spontaneously reported to them. Pregnancies and lactations 
that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment must be reported 
by the investigator if they  cause the subject to be excluded from the trial, or are 
the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not limited to 
washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a 
procedure.   
 
It is the responsibility of inves tigators or their designees to report any pregnancy 
or lactation in a subject (spontaneously reported to them), including the pregnancy 
of a male subject's female partner that occurs during the trial or within 120 days 
of completing the trial completing th e trial, or 30 days following cessation of 
treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, as a 
serious adverse event  within 24 hours to the UNCCN Project Manager who will 
report the event within 2 days to Merck Global Safety (see contact information 
below) .   
 
The patient is to be discontinued immediately from any protocol directed therapy. 
The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the 
outcome of the pregnancy and report the con dition of the fetus or newborn to the 
UNCCN Project Manager .   All subjects and female partners of male subjects who 
become pregnant must be followed to the completion/termination of the 
pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of death, spontaneous abortion, congeni tal 
anomaly, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, 
intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth  or other disabling or life -threatening 
complications to the mother or newborn  must be reported as SAEs .  If the 
pregnancy con tinues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported.  
Such events must be reported within 24 hours to the UNCCN Project Manager 
who will report the event within 2 days to Merck  Global Safety . 
 
Pregnancies (Information for Reporting to Celge ne) 
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test 
regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject 
is on IP, or within 28 days of the subject’s last dose of nab -paclitaxel, are 
considered imme diately reportable events.  Nab -paclitaxel is to be discontinued 
immediately. The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test 
must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by facsimile, or other 
appropriate method, using the Pregnancy Initial Report Form, or approved 
equivalent form. The female subject may be referred to an obstetrician -
gynecologist (not necessarily one with reproductive toxicity experience) or 
another appropriate healthcare professional for further evaluation.  
 
The Inv estigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, 
and must notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the 
pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow -up 
Report Form, or approved equiva lent form.  
 
LCCC 1516   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Jared Weiss, MD   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Amendment 4    May 23 , 2018  
 
60 If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic 
abortion), the Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE.  If the 
abnormal outcome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE 
to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by facsimile, or other appropriate method, 
within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE 
Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  
 
All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should  be reported, without 
regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the 
Investigator suspects is related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be 
reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by facsimile, or other a ppropriate 
method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the 
SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  
 
It is the responsibility of investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy 
or suspected pregnancy to Celgene Global Drug Safety Risk Management using a 
Pregnancy Report Form within 24 hours (see contact information below). If a 
female partner of a male subject taking nab -paclitaxel becomes pregnant, the male 
subject taking nab -paclitaxel should notify the Investi gator, and the pregnant 
female partner should be advised to call their healthcare provider immediately.  
Male patients treated with nab-paclitaxel are advised not to father a child during 
and up to 6 months after treatment.  
 
The pregnancy, suspected pregnan cy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported 
to the UNCCN Project Manager within 24 hours via facsimile to 919 -966-4300.  
The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician -gynecologist, preferably 
one experienced in reproductive toxicity for furt her evaluation and counseling.  
 
 FDA Expedited Reporting requirements:  
If an investigator deems that an event is both a serious SAR AND unexpected, it 
must also (in addition to Oncore) be recorded on the MedWatch Form 3500A as 
per 21 CFR 312.32. The MedWatch form should be faxed to the UNCCN Project 
Manager at 919 -966-4300 (or emailed, with address provided at the Start up 
Meeting (SIM)) along with supporting documentation defining the event and 
causality.  The UNCCN Project Manager will send repor t to the manufacturers . 
The MedWatch 3500a form can be accessed at:  
 
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/DownloadForms/default.ht

soon as possible.   
 
Expedited Reporting by Investigator to Celgene  
For the purpo se of regulatory reporting, Celgene Drug Safety will determine the 
expectedness of events of being related to nab-paclitaxel ( ABRAXANE ®) based 
on the Investigator Brochure.  In the United States, all suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be reported in an expedited manner in 
accordance with 21 CFR 312.32.  
 
SAE s are defined above.  The investigator must inform Celgene in writing using a 
Celgene SAE form or MEDWATCH 3500A form  of any SAE within 24 hours of 
being aware of the event .  The  written report must be completed and supplied to 
the UNC  Research Personnel within 24 hours  (the UNC  Research Personnel  will 
then fax to Celgene) .  The initial report must be as complete as possible, including 
an assessment of the causal relationship betw een the event and the investigational 
product(s).  Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end 
date for the adverse event or laboratory values received after the report) must be 
documented on a follow -up report.  A final repor t to document resolution of the 
SAE is required.  The Celgene tracking number and the institutional protocol 
number should be included on SAE reports (or on the fax cover letter) sent to 
Celgene .  A copy of the fax transmission confirmation of the SAE repo rt to 
Celgene should be attached to the SAE and retained with the patient records.  
 
Any overdose of nab -paclitaxel (see Section 5.2.7 ) should be reported within 24 
hours to Celgene.  
 
The investigator will collect and report all secondary primary malignancies that 
occur in subjects on this study for a period up to 3 years f ollowing discontinuation 
of Nab -paclitaxel to the Celgene Drug Safety and Risk Management group.

65 8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 Stud y Design  
This open -label, three -arm, non -comparative randomized phase II study is 
designed to evaluate three different sequences of double -consolidation with 
pembrolizumab and nab -paclitaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC post 
induction chemotherapy.  In ARMs A and B, consolidation is sequential, with 
either pembrolizumab followed by nab -paclitaxel (ARM A), or nab -paclitaxel 
followed by pembrolizumab (ARM B). In ARM C, consolidation is concurrent, 
with the two agents administered concurrently.   
 
The primary objective is to estimate overall survival in each arm.  Secondary 
objectives include estimating rates of response (via RECIST1.1 and Immune 
Related Response Criteria (irRC)), clinician observed and patient reported 
toxicity, and quality of life in each arm.  
8.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
In the Fidias trial referred to earlier [1], cytotoxic consolidation therapy provided 
an overall survival advantage of 2.6 months.  While data are currently limited, we 
believe pembrolizumab, particularly in patients with tumors known to be PD -
L1(+), could yield at least an additional 2.6 mont hs. Given the null hypothesis of 
9.7 months (using data from the Fidias trial), our alternative hypothesis is that 
double consolidation will yield a median OS of at least 15 months. Assuming 
uniform accrual, no loss to follow -up, exponentially distributed times, and a one -
side alpha  of 0.1, 35 patients per arm provide 80% power to detect this level of 
improvement.  We anticipate accrual to take 18 months , with follow -up time of at 
least 12 months . This calculation was made using the SWOG Statistical Center 
online tool for one arm survival ( https://stattools.crab.org/# ). 
 
We will consider any of the 3 ARMS worthy of additional study if the lower end 
of the 95% confidence interval for the estimated median OS is greater than 9.7 
months , and the interval includes or exceeds 15 months . 
8.3 Data Analysi s Plans  
The primary endpoint i s the estimation of OS from the first day of study 
treatment , and will be done using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) method separately for 
each arm .  The median OS will be provided along with a 95% confidence interval.  
If the intervals for any of the arms exclude t he null hypothesis of 9.7 months, and 
include the alternative hypothesis of 15 months, data from those arms will be 
combined to provide an aggregate estimate.  This will be done in the absence of a 
formal test to determine equivalence given the sample size .   
 
All patients who receive at least one dose of treatment will be included in these 
estimates, with censoring used as needed (ex. if a patient drops out of the study, or 
analysis is done before all patients have had the event of interest).  The KM

68 9.0 STUDY MANAGEMENT  
9.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval and Consent  
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in 
accordance  with federally mandated regulations.  The IRB should approve the 
consent form and protocol.  
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply 
with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration 
of Helsinki.  
   
Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full 
explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the co nsent 
form. Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required 
by the FDA Regulations and local or state regulations. Once this essential 
information has been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that 
the patient  understands the implications of participating in the study, the patient 
will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by signing an 
IRB-approved consent form.  
 
Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form 
should be signed and personally dated by the patient and by the person who 
conducted the informed consent discussion.  
9.2 Required Documentation  
Before the study can be initiated at any site, the following documentation must be 
provided to the Clinical Protoco l Office (CPO) at the University of North 
Carolina.  
 
 A copy of the official IRB approval letter for the protocol and 
informed consent  
 IRB membership list  
 CVs and medical licensure for the principal investigator and any sub -
investigators who will be involve d in the study.  
 Form FDA 1572 appropriately filled out and signed with appropriate 
documentation (NOTE: this is required if UNC holds the IND.  
Otherwise, the Investigator’s signature documenting understanding of 
the protocol and providing commitment that this trial will be 
conducted according to all stipulations of the protocol is sufficient to 
ensure compliance)  
 CAP and CLIA Laboratory certification numbers and institution lab 
normal values  
 Executed clinical research contract

documents  to confirm eligibility. .  
9.4 Data Management and Monitoring/Auditing  
The CPO UNCCN of the UNC LCCC will serve as the coordinating center for 
this trial. Data will be collected through a web based clinical research platform, 
OnCore®.  Other study institutions will be given a password to directly enter their 
own data onto the web site via eCRFs.  UNCCN personnel will coordinate and 
manage data for qua lity control assurance and integrity.  
 
All data will be collected and entered into OnCore® by Clinical Research 
Associates (CRAs) from UNC LCCC and participating institutions.  The 
investigators at each site will allow monitors to review all source documen ts 
supporting data entered into OnCore®.   The UNCCN Data Coordinator can be 
reached at 919 -843-2742 or 1 -877-668-0683.  
 
As an investigator initiated study, this trial will also be audited by the Lineberger 
Cancer Center audit committee every six or twelve  months, depending on the 
participation of affiliate sites.  
9.5 Adherence to the Protocol  
Except for an emergency situation in which proper care for the protection, safety, 
and well -being of the study patient requires alternative treatment, the study shall 
be conducted exactly as described in the approved protocol.   
9.5.1 Emergency Modifications  
UNC  and Affiliate investigators may implement a deviation from, or a change of, 
the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to trial subjects without prior 
UNC or their respective institution’s IRB/IEC approval/favorable opinion.   
 
For Institutions Rely ing on UNC’s IRB:  
For any such emergency modification implemented, a UNC IRB modification 
form must be completed by UNC Research Personnel within five (5) business 
days of making the change.   
 
For Institutions Relying on Their Own IRB:  
For Affiliate inves tigators relying on their own institution’s IRB, as soon as 
possible after the modification has been made, the implemented deviation or 
change and the reasons for it should be submitted to:  
 
 To UNC Principal Investigator for agreement

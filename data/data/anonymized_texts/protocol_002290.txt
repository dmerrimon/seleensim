CO-PRINCIPAL 
INVESTIGATOR S Kenneth Rosenfield MD – Interventional Cardiologist  
Akhilesh Sista MD  – Interventional Radiologist  
STUDY  DEVICE  The Bashir ™ Endovascular Catheter is a device intended for the localized 
infusion of therapeutic agents into the pulmonary artery and peripheral 
vasculature.  
THROMBOLYTIC  
ADMINISTRATION  Pulse Sprays:  
r-tPA 2mg in 2 0cc 0.9%  NaCl divided into two ( 2) 10cc syringes to administer 
in two  (2) pulse sprays, 1 0cc each , through the basket infusion port with 10cc 
syringe s.  
Unilateral PE : 2mg total in 2 0cc administered in two (2) 10cc syringes.  
Bilateral PE:  4 mg total in 40cc administered in two  (2) 10cc syringes into each 
PA for a total of four  (4) syringes, two  (2) into each PA.  
Infusion:   
Unilateral PE : r-tPA 10mg in  750cc  0.9%  NaCl infus ed at 1.27mg/hr at an 
infusion  rate of 95cc/hr , through the Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter  until 
complete. Total r -tPA dose (pulse spray and infusion) is 12. 0mg. 
Bilateral PE: r-tPA 5mg in 500cc 0.9%  NaCl infused at 0. 65mg/hr at a n infusion  
rate of 6 5cc/hr bilate rally through each Bashir ™ Endovascular Catheter , until 
complete for a total r -tPA dose of 1 .3mg/hr, 0. 65mg per hour through each 
catheter . Total r -tPA dose (pulse spray and infusion) is 14. 0mg. 
ANTICOAGULANT  
DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION  Pre-procedure : Unfractionated heparin will be administered IV to prolong  the 
aPTT pre-procedure  (suggested range 60 -80 seconds) . 
Note: Use of enoxaparin (Lovenox®) is permitted pre -procedure for the treatment 
of PE. If Lovenox is given,  then catheter directed th rombolysis  procedure  is to 
start no sooner than 12 hours after the last Lovenox dose was administered . 
Procedure :  Heparin infusion will be discontinued upon arrival in the IR/Cath  lab.  
ACT will be monitored in IR/Cath Lab and heparin boluses  administered  to 
achieve ACT ≥ 200 seconds.  
During r -tPA Infusion : Heparin  infusion  will be restarted  post-procedure  and 
administered  through the side arm of each sheath to prolong  the aPTT (s uggested 
range  40-60 seconds ).  
Post r -tPA Infusion : Upon  completion  of r-tPA infusion , maintain patency 
through the BEC by replacing r -tPA with heparinized saline TKO using the 
infusion pump.   Starting 45 minutes (± 15 minutes) after  the r-tPA completion, 
administer Lovenox 1mg/ kg sub-Q every 12 hours (±30 minutes) through the 
completion of the 48-hour CTA.

5. Clinically R elevant Non-Major bleeding: Any sign or symptom of 
hemorrhage (e.g. more bleeding than would be expected for a clinical 
circumstance, including bleeding found by imaging alone) that does  not fit 
the criteria for the ISTH definition of major bleeding but does meet at least one of the following criteria:  
a. Requiring medical intervention by a healthcare professional.  
b. Leading to hospitalization or increased level of care.  
c. Prompting a face to  face (i.e., not just a telephone or electronic

level are scored a value equal to the number of segmental arteries arising 
distally . To provide additional information about the residual perfusion distal 
to the embolus, a weighting factor i s assigned to each value, depending on the 
degree of vascular obstruction.  This factor i s equal to zero, when no thrombus 
is observed; 1, when parti ally occlusive thrombus i s observed; or 2, with total 
occlusion . Thus, the maximal CT obstruction index is  40 per patient.22

Tropon in I Cardiac troponins are the most sensitive and the most specific biochemical 
markers showing myocardial injury. Elevated troponin can also be seen in 
acute pericarditis, myocarditis, acute PE, severe cardiac failure, sepsis and 
acute renal failure as well as in myocardial infarction.  In acute PE, the 
mechanic load of the right ventricle is increased because of the increased 
pulmonary vascular resistance following pulmonary artery obstruction. That 
can lead to acute right ventricular  dilatation. The dilatatio n and hypokinesia 
of the right ventricle may cause severe myocardial ischemia and increase the 
troponin levels. Increased serum cTnI levels support the diagnosis of severe  
PE.

4.1 Clinical Problem  
Acute venous thromboembolism (VTE)  includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and acute 
pulmonary embolism (PE). PE occurs when a deep vein thrombus breaks loose  and embolizes 
to the pulmonary artery . Pulmonary embolism is the third leading cause of cardiovascular death 
after myocardial infarction and stroke and is a major global health problem .1,2    
 
Raskob et al (2014) conducted a literature search and review and found that there is a strong and 
consistent association between  an increase in incidence of VTE and increasing  age. They found 
the annual incidence increased from between 2 and 7 per 1 ,000 population for those 79 and 
younger to between 3 and 12 per 1, 000 population for those age d 80 and older.  This finding has 
major implications  for the treatment of the elderly in the US healthcare system.2 It is important 
to note that 60 percent of the VTE events are associated  with hospitalization .3 The number of 
deaths from VTE in the USA has previously been reported to be approxim ately 300,000 
annually.3,4 Clinically , patients may present with DVT or PE , or both.  With many of the known 
risk factors, advanced age, immobility, surgery, obesity, increasing in our society, this number 
only continues to grow.  Because there is no national surveillance program for VTE, the precise 
number with VTE of all types is unknown.5,6 
 
Patients who present with PE may be classified into low risk, intermediate risk (submassive) or 
high risk  (massive) PE. Both massive and submassive PE cause right ventricular (RV) 
dysfunc tion, while massive PE in addition causes systemic hypotension.  Typical  diagnostic 
studies include contrast enhanced computerized tomography (CT) to diagnose the PE, 
echocardiography to assess right and left ventricular function, and cardiac biomarkers, s uch as 
troponin I , and BNP  to assess the degree of myocardial ischemia/strain  associated with  the PE .  
Patients categorized as having a low-risk PE do not have  evidence of hemodynamic compromise 
or RV dysfunction.  Low risk PE  patients are not included in this study for obvious reasons.7 
4.2 Current Treatment Options   
Anticoagula nt therapies are administered to symptomatic patients while their work -ups are 
being completed for a definitive diagnosis of massive or submassive PE.  For the treatment of 
massive and submassive PE, both systemic administration and catheter -directed administration 
of thrombolytic  therapies have been utilized .8-10 However, systemic administration of 
thrombolytics carries a prohibitively high risk of bleeding: Up to 7% intracranial bleeds and up 
to 20% major  bleeding rates;  hence the attraction of delivering thrombolytics in much lower 
dosage directly into the clot to treat this potentially  life-threatening condition.11   
Devices for percutaneous treatment of patients in whom systemic thrombolytic therapy is 
absolutely contraindicated  have been developed and utilized.   The percutaneous devices include  
manual thrombus fragmentation using a balloon dilatation catheter or a pigtail  (off-the shelf 
technologies) . More recent ly, catheters specifically created for thrombus fragmentation  that 
produce greater  fragmentation  of the clot compared to off-the -shelf technologies ment ioned

This protocol is confidential property of Thrombolex, Inc and in no way should be distributed all or in

thrombus burden;  rheolytic thrombectomy where a saline jet is directed into the clot and the clot 
and saline are aspirated , have been introduced.7-10,12-14  However , there are also hazards 
associated with rapid clot fragmentation including hemodynamic collapse   due to the distal 
embolization of thrombus and release of vasoactive substances.     
Over the past several years a d evice received 510(k) clearance for its ultrasound-facilitated, 
catheter directed low-dose fibrinolysis using r-tPA  (EKOS, Bothell WA). With this technology,  
the EKOS ultrasound device was used to deliver t -PA in patients with massive and submassive 
PE at 1mg/hour over 24 hours (unilateral PE), and 2mg /hour  over 12 hours (bilateral PE).  This 
treatment methodology achieved an absolute reduction in RV:LV ratio of 0.42 (±0.36), the mean 
baseline was 1.55 (±0.39) and at 48 hours 1.13 (±0.2).15,17  
While it is critical to reduce RV/LV ratio, it is of great importance to both short-term and long -
term patient outcomes to decrease the thrombus burden as much as is feasible.  Even a small 
reduction in the clot burden can translate into a marked improvement in RV function and 
improve acute survival. However, much more effective reduction in the residua l clot burden is 
required to reduce the long -term complications of PE, including disabling post -PE syndrome 
and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).7   
4.3 Study Rationale  
While the medical community continues to focus on prevention of VTE, h alf of all VTE patients 
have unprovoked VTE. Therefore , the treatment options for patients who present with DVT 
and/or acute PE must continue to evolve to increase efficacy, decrease side effects, limit long -
term complications, and provide an improved quality of life for the se patient s. This study is 
focused on the  treatment of patients with acute submassive PE with an interventional  device  
designed  to increase the exposure of the thrombus burden to endogenous and exogenous 
thrombolytics, thus this increased exposure has the potential  to greatly decrease the thrombu s 
burden.   
 
The Bashir ™ Endovascular Catheter has been designed to administer therapeutic agents in the 
peripheral v asculature.  Because of the unique design of the catheter, with its six expandable 
infusion limbs, the Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter has the ability to: 1. Create a much larger 
central channel for blood flow, thereby utilizing the body’s own endogenous fibrinolytic agents  
to lyse the clot , and 2. Greatly enhance the radial dispersion of  a catheter -admin istered 
thrombolytic agent throughout the thrombus.  Expansion of the multiple arms of the basket in 
the infusion catheter causes fissuring of the clot. The net result is that a greater surface area of 
clot is exposed to both endogenous and exogenously adm inistered lytic agents, thereby 
promoting clot dissolution.  
 
This first-in -man study will utilize the Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter to administer catheter 
directed thrombolysis in patients with submassive  PE who  have consented and meet all 
eligibility criteria.  The Bashir ™ catheter represents a new methodology for localized catheter -
based delivery of thrombolytics.  The thrombolytic to be used in this study is r -tPA (Genen tech

This protocol is confidential property of Thrombolex, Inc and in no way should be distributed all or in 
part without  written permission from Thrombolex, Inc.  Corporation, South San Francisco, USA ).16 The d osing of the thrombolytic in the past has been 
much greater than what is proposed in this study.  The SEATTLE II study administered a total 
of 24 mg of r -tPA over 12 hours for bilateral PE and 24mg over 24 hours for unilateral PE.  The 
incidence of major b leeding in the SEATTLE II study was 10 percent.17 The design of the Bashir 
Endovascular Catheter with the multiple  infusion limbs creating a basket -like formation when 
expanded, provide s a greater surface area in the thrombus for the endogenous and exogenous 
thrombolytics to take effect , as described above.  
 
Because of the rationale stated  previously,  a reduced dose of thrombolytic can be administered 
over a reduced period of time due to an increased exposure of the clot to endogenous and 
exogenous thrombolytics  for clot dissolution.  The Optalyse study, using the E KOS  catheter, 
presented at ISET, February 6, 2018, was conducted to assess the outcomes with lower dose r -
tPA administration for the treatment of acute submassive  PE. Four groups were administered 
lower doses of r -tPA over a shorter period of time.  While each group showed a statistically 
significant reduction in RV/LV ratio at 48 hours post -proc edure, the reduction in residual clot 
burden was noticeably lower (6%) in patients treated with the smallest dose of r - tPA for the 
shortest time period (4/8 mg r -tPA over 2 hours) compared to those treated with the highest dose 
for the longest duration (2 6% reduction in clot burden; 12/24 mg r -tPA over 6 hours). This 
illustrates the discordance between reduction in RV/LV diameter ratio and reduction in clot 
burden. It is much easier to achieve the former than the latter with low doses of r -tPA for shorter 
periods of time. There is clearly also a lot of room for improvement if 74% of the clot burden 
still remains after the highest dose of infusion in the OPTALYSE study.18  
 
We hypothesize that the dose of r -tPA may be reduced using the Bashir ™ Endovascular C atheter 
from what was administered in the SEATTLE II study, i.e. 24mg over 12 hours (bilateral PE) 
or 24 hours (unilateral PE) , because of its unique features described previously .17 We therefore 
propose to utilize the following regimen: r -tPA 2mg in 2 0 cc administered in 1mg and 1 0cc 
increments x 2 into the PA for a total of 2 pulse sprays into the infusion basket via its infusion 
port on the handle, using a syringe, followed by a 10mg infusion at  1.27mg per hour until 
complete for unilateral PE, and 5mg infusion into each pulmonary artery for bilateral PE, at 
0.65mg/hour until complete for a total dose of 1. 3mg/hour for bilateral PE .  This is a total of 12  
mg over approximately 8  hours (pulse spray 1mg x 2 sprays = 2mg plus infusion at 1.27mg/hour 
x 7.87 hours ( approximately 8 hours = 12mg) for unilateral PE. For bilateral PE, we propose to 
administer the same pulse spray and one -half of the infusion dose into each PA to total the 
unilateral infusion dose, for a total of 14mg administere d including the pulse sprays and the 
infusions. This is a substantially lower dose and a shorter duration of  treatment compared to 
SEATTLE II  for the treatment of PE in a similar patient cohort.  Additionally, an efficacy study 
stopping rule has been estab lished for this study based on the reduction in RV:LV diameter ratio 
observed in the SEATTLE II study (0.42-0.36) .  The minimal reduction of 0.06 in SEATTLE II  
formed the basis for the efficacy study stopping rule  for this study.  If a reduction is less than  
0.06 ( refer to  Section 18.3)  in the first three patients, the study will be paused to re -evaluate the 
r-tPA dosage and administration.

7.1 Pre-Procedure Testing Within 48 Hours Pre -Procedure  
7.1.1 Laboratory Tests  
1. CMP, CBC, Cardiac Biomarkers Troponin I and BNP  – These tests will 
be drawn within 48 hours pre -procedure.  
 
2. aPTT – Drawn within 48 hours pre -procedure. Unfractionated heparin will 
be infused  to prolong the aPTT (suggested range is 60 -80 seconds ) prior to 
the administration of r -tPA .  The institution is to follow the standard of care 
for the administration of heparin through the completion of the r -tPA 
infusion and the monitoring of aPTT in addition to the aPTTs measured at 
certain time points req uired by this protocol.  
 
3. International Normalized Ratio (INR)  – INR will be drawn within 48 
hours pre -procedure for patients who are on Coumadin and must be ≤ 1.5 
to be eligible for enrollment.   Patients who are on Coumadin and have a n 
INR ≤ 1.5 who are in the study the coumadin will be discontinued during 
the heparin infusion and the r -tPA infusion and can be restarted prior to 
discharge.   
 
4. Fibrinogen – Fibrinogen levels are required to be che cked within 48 hours 
prior to the procedure.   The assay method must be recorded (e.g. Clauss, 
PT-derived fibrinogen assay, immunological, gravimetric, other)  
7.1.2 Imaging  
1. Contrast Enhanced CT A of Chest  – A contrast enhanced CT A of chest  
will be performed within 48 hours  pre-procedure.   The contrast enhanced 
chest CTA is used to determine the pre -procedure Modified Miller Index 
Score within 48 hours prior to the procedure . CT will be sent to the core lab 
for analysis.  
 
2. Lower Extrem ity Venous DUS  – A duplex ultrasound is required pre -
procedure to verify patency of the common femoral vein ( CFV ) for femoral 
access. The right CFV or the left CFV may be used for access, whichever  
is patent. If both of the CFVs are not patent, an internal jugular (IJ) vein 
may be used for access. IJ access may also be used if that is the operator’s 
preference.  
 
3. Echocardiogram – The echocardiogram will be done to determine the pre-
procedure RV/LV end -diastolic diameter ratio . A core lab protocol will be 
followed for data acquisition.  The echocardiogram will be sent to the core 
lab for analys es.

1. Physical Exam ination – The physician will perform a physical exam 
within 48 hours prior to the procedure to ensure  the subject meets eligibility 
criteria.  
 
2. RV/LV Diameter Ratio  – The RV/LV ratio will be measured within 48 
hours pre -procedure by contrast enhanced chest CTA to ensure the subject 
meets the eligibility criteria of a n axial RV/LV  ratio ≥ 0.9.  RV/LV ratio is 
required to be assessed by contrast enhanced chest CTA to determine 
eligibility. The site determines eligibility, and an independent core lab 
protocol will be followed for data acquisition.  Both the contrast enhanced 
chest CTA and echocardiogram will be sent to the core lab for analysis.  
 
3. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)  – A 12 -lead ECG will be performed 
prior to the procedure.  
7.1.4 Anticoagulation 
Unfractionated heparin is required to be used for a nticoagulation and is to  be 
started pre-procedure  by intravenous administration  to prolong the  aPTT 
(suggested range is 60 -80 seconds)  unless the patient has received Lovenox .  
The institution is to follow the standard of care for the administration of heparin 
and the monitoring of aPTT in addition to the aPTTs measured at certain time 
points required by this protocol.  Stop the heparin administration at the 
completion of the r -tPA infusion. The final aPTT should be measured according 
to standard of care.  
7.1.5 Patients  Receiving  Lovenox for Treatment of Pulmonary Embolism 
Lovenox: Use of Lovenox is permitted pre -procedure for the treatment of PE  if 
it is the standard of care. If Lovenox is administered to a potential study subject, 
then catheter directed th rombolysis  procedure is to start no sooner than 12 hours 
from  the last Lovenox dose . 
 
During the  CDT  procedure in the IR suite/Cath lab  ACTs will be checked and 
heparin bolus given to achieve ACT ≥ 200 seconds.  
 
After completion of the CDT  procedure , a heparin drip will be started prior to 
leaving the IR suite/Cath lab  to maintain therapeutic dose  through completion 
of the r-tPA infusion.

48-hour CT scan.  
 
The institution is to follow the standard of care for the administration of 
heparin  and the monitoring of aPTT in addition to the aPTTs measured at 
certain time points required by this protocol. 
4. Maintaining Patency Through the Central Lumen of the BEC(s) : 
Remove the wire from the central lumen of the BEC and  attach a 3 -way 
stopcock and f lush with heparinized saline to maintain patency in the 
central lumen of the BEC (both BECs if bilateral PEs) when transferring to 
ICU.  
 
If it is standard of care in the IR suite/Cath lab  to attach pressure tubing 
prior to transfer to the ICU for continuous PA pressure monitoring in the ICU, that may be done in lieu of heparinized flush in a syringe to maintain 
patency when transferring f rom the IR suite/Cath lab  to the ICU.  The 
central lumen of the BEC will be used for continuous monitoring of the PA pressures in the ICU.  Hospital standard protocol will be used to maintain 
patency of the central lumen and to perform continuous pressure 
monitoring through the BEC in the ICU.   
For example, heparinized saline to a pressure bag and pressure monitor 
tubing connected  to the bedside monitor to transduce pressure from the 
central lumen  of the BEC may be performed; if there are two BECs in place 
for bilateral PEs, the central lumen of both BECs require pressure tubing 
for continuous pressure monitoring and kept open with standard pressure tubing transduced to the bedside monitor using heparinized saline in a 
pressure bag to keep the line patent and for c ontinuous PA pressure 
monitoring and S vO

12.0 ANTICIPATED ADVERSE EVENTS  
The following events are anticipated adverse events in subjects who are treated for pulmonary 
embolism. An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence associated  with the use of a 
drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related (21 CFR 312.32(a)).  
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event  caused by a drug.  A suspected adverse 
reaction is an adverse event where there is a reasonable possibility the drug caused the adverse 
event. The sponsor is responsible for making the causality.

13.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
13.1 Serious Adverse Events and Serious Suspected Adv erse Reactions 
Serious adverse events (SAE)  or serious suspected adverse reaction (S USAR)  
must be reported to the study manager within 24 hours of knowledge of the 
event.   
Serious adverse event  or serious suspected adverse reaction:    An adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
1. Death ;  
2. A life -threatening adverse event ; 
3. Inpatient hospitalization or prolongati on of existing hospitalization ; 
4. A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect ;

This protocol is confidential property of Thrombolex, Inc and in no way should be distributed all or in 
part without  written permission from Thrombolex, Inc.  5. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threaten ing, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.   
The following event definitions, as defined in 21 CFR 312.32 (a) will be reported 
as serious adverse events and the reporting requirements above must be 
followed.  
Life-threatening adverse event  (or life-threatening suspected adverse 
reaction):  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "life-
threatening" if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places 
the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death.  
13.2 Unexpected Adverse Event  or Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  
The following event definitions, as defined in 21 CFR 312.32 (a) will be reported 
as serious adverse events and the reporting requirements above must be 
followed.  
An Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Reaction is considered "unexpected" if it is 
not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specifici ty or severity that 
has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or 
elsewhere in the current application, as amended.  
It is antic ipated that no unexpected adverse reactions will occur as r-tPA is FDA 
approved for the treatment of pulmonary embolism.  The currently approved 
labeling requires 100mg of r -tPA to be administered intravenously over two (2) 
hours . This is 86mg more than the maximum dose required in this protocol 
administered over two (2) hours, not over approximately eight ( 8) hours as in 
this protocol. 
13.3 Adverse Event  Documentation  
All adverse event s (AEs) including those categorized as anticipated, life threatening, 
serious, unexpected, and suspected  are to be repor ted on the case report form.

This protocol is confidential property of Thrombolex, Inc and in no way should be distributed all or in 
part without  written permission from Thrombolex, Inc.  Related  The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational 
agent/procedure – i.e. an event that follows a reasonable 
temporal sequence from administration of the study intervention, 
follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected 
intervention, that is confirmed by improvement on stopping and 
reappearance of the event on repeated exposure and that could 
not be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state.  
Possibly Related  An adverse event that follows a reasonable temporal seq uence 
from administration of the study intervention follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected intervention, but that 
could readily have been produced by a number of other factors . 
Not Related  The adverse event is clearly not related to  the investigational 
agent/procedure - i.e. another cause of the event is most 
plausible; and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is 
inconsistent with the onset of the event and the study intervention 
and/or a causal relationship is considered biol ogically 
implausible. 
13.5  Investigator SAE Reporting Requirements  
An SAE occurring during the study or within 30 days of stopping the treatment must 
be reported to the study safety monitor. Any such SAE due to any cause, whether or 
not related to the study medication, must be reported within 24 hours of occurrence or 
when the investigator becomes aware of the event.  
The investigator must send a preliminary report of any such SAE to the project 
manager  via the EDC system within 24 hours or if this is not possible via email or fax 
using an SAE Report Form, or at a minimum by telephone.   
The event must be recorded on the electronic SAE CRF page. Preliminary reports of 
SAEs must be followed by detailed descriptions, including clear pseudonymized 
photocopies of hospital case reports, consultant reports, autopsy reports, and other 
documents when requested and applicable. All photocopies should be redacted to 
remove patients’ personal details and annotated with the patient’s unique study 
identifiers. SAE reports must be made whether or not the investigator considers the 
event to  be related to the investigational drug.   Appropriate remedial measures should 
be taken to treat the SAE, and the response to treatment should be recorded. Patients 
must be closely followed until sufficient information is obtained to indicate a return to 
normal status or until the event stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator.

This protocol is confidential property of Thrombolex, Inc and in no way should be distributed all or in 
part without  written permission from Thrombolex, Inc.  16.2 Data Analysis  
Data collected will be summarized using descriptive statistics. The study is not 
statistically powered for the analysis of primary endpoints .   Concomitant medications 
will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) -drug dictionary and AEs 
will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA).  
16.3 Data Entr y 
 
Data will be entered into a 21 CFR 11 compliant database, electronic data capture 
(EDC) for this study.  The site staff shall be responsible for data entry.  
17.0 DATA SAFETY MONITOR 
A data safety monitor will be selected to review the study conduct, feasibility data, and safety data and will adjudicate all types of adverse events reported  in this study.  The independent DSM shall have the 
final adjudication for the events.  A data safety charter will be established  and will be approved by the 
data safety monitor.  Qualifications for the DSM , at a minimum, shall  include current experience wi th 
catheter directed thrombolysis for the treatment of massive and submassive pulmonary emboli , 
management of the patient post -treatment and extensive research experience. Adherence to the study 
stopping criteria in this protocol will also be included in the DSM meetings in addition to following the 
charter.  
18.0 STUDY STOPPING CRITERIA  
This first-in-man study is to demonstrate safety  and device success defined as the ability to use the 
Bashir ™ Endovascular Catheter as intended for the treatment of pulmonary embolism.   The treatment 
for pulmonary embolism in this study utilizes the Bashir ™ Endovascular Catheter for the delivery of r -
tPA into the pulmonary artery. The dose of r -tPA in this study is much less than the FDA approved 
prescribed dose (FDA approved dosing 100mg infused intravenously over two hours for massive PE 
versus this study dose of approximately 12mg [for unilateral PE] to approximately 14mg [for bilateral 
PEs] over approximately 8 hours into the PA) .   The study stopping criteria will be based on criteria 
related to bleeding, device use, and early efficacy.  
 
18.1 General Study Stopping Rules  
18.1.1  The Sponsor, DSM, IRBs, regulatory authorities, or the principal investigators 
may make recommendations to terminate the study if the safety and well -being 
of the subjects are in jeopardy.  
18.1.2  If the study is terminated or suspended, prompt notification will be provided to 
all parties involved in the conduct of the study.  
18.1.3  Patient enrollment may be paused or terminated early if the Sponsor or DSM 
determines that the potential benefits of the investigational device are unlikely to outweigh the risks associated with continuation of the trial.

This protocol is confidential property of Thrombolex, Inc and in no way should be distributed all or in 
part without  written permission from Thrombolex, Inc.  18.2 Safety Study Stopping Rule  
If two (2) patients undergoi ng the investigational procedure die or experience 
an unprovoked intracranial hemorrhage, confirmed by independent DSM 
adjudication, and did not have a protocol violation such that he/she cannot be 
considered as representative of the intended patient popul ation, the study shall 
be paused for re -evaluation, and may be stopped.   
18.3 Efficacy Study Stopping Rule  
Should the treatment not achieve a reduction in RV:LV ratio as measured by 
CT at 48 hours by at least 0.06 compared to baseline, in three of the first three 
patients, the study shall be paused for re -evaluation. 
18.4 Device Study Stopping Rules  
18.4.1  Should it be suspected that a device caused a serious adverse event, the serious 
adverse event will be adjudicated by the independent  DSM and the device shall 
be returned to the manufacturer.  A root cause analysis shall be performed. The DSM  will determine if the stud y should be stopped, temporarily suspended, or 
continued after each such event .   
 
18.4.2  There are device malfunctions, or non -conformances, that may impact the 
patient and prevent treatment with an investigational device.  Upon 
commencement of enrollment, if there are device failures that prevent three (3) 
patients from being treated in this study, the study shall be paused for re -
evaluation.   A root cause analysis will be performed to determine the cause(s) 
of the device failures and a correct ive and preventative action will be 
implemented.    
18.5 Study Safety Reporting Requirements  
The following reporting requirements are the responsibility of the sponsor and are transferred to Eminence Clinical research, Inc. to meet these reporting obligations.  For 
investigations of marketed drugs under an IND, such as in this study requiring the

1 INR is only required at baseline for patients on Coumadin (warfarin)  and must be ≤ 1.5 prior to enrollment. If patient is eligible for the study, Coumadin will be discontinued temporarily for study purposes.  
2 Pre-procedure  suggested aPTT 60 -80s.  Suggeste d aPTT during r -tPA administration is 40-60s. Check aPTT and CBC 4 h r (±1 hr) after heparin  is restarted in the IR suite/Cath lab (suggested range 60 -80s). 
3 Unfractionated Heparin will be infused IV pre -procedure  or Lovenox . Stop Heparin prior to start of procedure. Restart Heparin post procedure with r-tPA infusion . Fibrinogen to be drawn at time of BEC removal  in IR  suite /Cath lab.  
 Heparin infusion will continue until the completion of the r -tPA infusion.  Lovenox 1mg/ kg Sub -Q will be started 45 minutes (±15 minutes)  from  the completion of the r -tPA infusion  and given q12hrs (±30 min) . 
4Required: PAS, PAD , PA Mean , CO, CI, S pO2, SvO 2 / ACT - in IR/Cath  lab at baseline  (print waveforms) and post -infusion  in the IR  suite /Cath Lab . Swan -Ganz or angled pigtail may be used.  CO= Modified Fick calculation.  ACT 
will be done to achieve  (and document ) an ACT ≥ 200 seconds.  
5IV solution must be mixed according to protocol and infuse at the prescribed rate into target PA, or both PAs if bilateral PE. Infusion is to be administered at the rate prescribed in this protocol, which is a duration of approximately 8 
 hours.  Once the r -tPA infusion is complete, heparinized saline must infuse T KO using the infusion pump until BEC removal.

 COHORT 2 Recurrent unresectable and/or metastat ic salivary gland carcinomas (RMSGC) 
 
2.0 TRIAL DESIGN 
2.1 Trial Design 
This study is an open label, single arm study which will enroll in patients with RMHNSCC and RMSGC.  Positive tumor PDL1 expression by IHC will not be required for enrollment. 
All patients with receive MK- 3475 and vorinostat in combination. Vorinostat will be started 
on the same day as the initia tion of MK-475 200 mg flat dose given Q21 days and continued 
through the 21 day cycle. Vorinosta t will be given 5 out of 7 days at a dose of 400mg QD.  
Vorinostat and MK-3475 have well defined t oxicities as single agents and have non-
overlapping mechanisms of action.  The safety of  the two agents used in combination has not 
been previously described; therefore the st udy will be conducted in a phase I/II design.   
 
2.1.1 Phase I run in 
 Both drugs are FDA approved for other disease indications, with safety and tolerability well described at the approved doses. Therefore the limited phase I po rtion of this study aims to

assess the safety and tolerability of this drug combination at their established doses.   There 
will be no dose escalation cohorts within this phase I run in group. 
 
The first six patients will constitute the phase  I portion of this study. These initial 6 patients 
may come from either cohort and will be asse ssed for dose limiting toxicities (DLTs, defined 
in Section 2.1.1.1) after completion of cycle #1.  After these first 6 patients initiate cycle #1, 
enrollment to the study will be temporarily halted, and a formal DLT evaluation of all 6 
patients will be conducted.  
If ≤ 2 of these six patients experience DLTs  after completion of cycle #1, then the 
study will proceed to the phase II portion,  using MK-3475 200mg IV Q21 days and  
Vorinostat 400mg PO 5 out of 7 days (x 3 weeks) of each 21 day cycle. 
 If > 2 of these first 6 patients experi ence a DLT upon completion of cycle #1, the 
study will proceed to the phase II por tion using MK-3475 IV 200mg Q28 days 
Vorinostat 300mg daily 5 out of 7 days (x 4 weeks) of each 28 day cycle. 
 Only upon completion of the DLT evaluation for th ese first 6 patients and the determination 
of appropriate Phase II dose, will enrollment reopen for the phase II expansion.  
2.1.1.1 Definition of Dose-L imiting Toxicities  
 
All toxicities will be graded using National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE Version 4.0 (see 
Appendix). 
 
The occurrence of any of the following toxicities  during Cycle 1 will be considered a DLT, if 
judged by the Investigator to be possibly, pr obably or definitely  related to study drug 
administration:  
1. Grade 4  non-hematologic to xicity (not laboratory) 
 
2. Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity (not laboratory) lasting >3 days despite 
optimal supportive care.  
 
3. Any Grade 3 or Grade 4 non-hema tologic laboratory value if:  
• Medical intervention is require d to treat the patient, or 
• The abnormality lead s to hospitalization 
 
4. Grade 3 or Grade 4 febrile neutropenia: 
 Grade 3 is defined as ANC <1000/mm3 with a single temperature of >38.3 
degrees C (101 degrees F) or a sustained temperature of ≥ 38 degrees C 
(100.4 degrees F) for more than one hour 
•     Grade 4 is defined as ANC < 1000/mm3 with a single temperature of 
>38.3 degrees C (101 degrees F) or a sustained temperature of ≥ 38 degrees C (100.4

degrees F) for more than one hour, with life-threatening conse quences and urgent 
intervention indicated. 
 
5. Prolonged delay (>2 weeks) in initia ting cycle 2 due to treatment-related 
toxicity 
 
6.    Hematologic toxicity requiring dose modifications as outlined in Section 
5.1.2.4 
 7.    Grade 5 toxicity.   
2.1.2. Phase II expansion  
 
After the first 6 patients have been asse ssed for DLTs upon completion of cycle 1 of 
treatment, and the appropriate vorinostat dos e and MK-3475 dosing interval determined for 
phase II expansion, additional patients will  be enrolled with RMHNSCC (Cohort 1) and 
RMSCG (Cohort 2) to total 35 patients in each cohor t.  Patients enrolled in the phase  I and II 
portioins will be used to assess the safety and e fficacy outcomes of interest in each cohort.   
 Patients will be evaluated every 9 weeks (63 ± 7 days) with radiographic imaging to assess 
response to treatment.   All imaging will be assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 Patients will also be  assessed by immune response criteria (IrRC 
– Appendix) for determination of overall respon se rate (ORR) and progression-free survival 
(PFS).  Adverse events will be monitored throughout the trial and graded in severity according to the guidelines outlined in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.   
Treatment with MK-3475 and vorinostat will con tinue until two years of therapy have been 
administered, or until 
1. Documented disease progression (investig ators may elect to continue MK-3475 
treatment beyond progression in specific circumstances, unacceptable adverse 
event(s) 
2. Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment 
3. Investigator’s decision to  withdraw the subject 
4. Subject withdraws consent,  
5. Pregnancy of the subject,  
6. Non-compliance with trial treatment or pr ocedure requirements, or administrative 
reasons.

MK-3475 and vorinostat treated subjects who atta in an investigator-determined confirmed 
complete response (CR) per RECIST 1.1 and Ir RC may consider stoppi ng trial treatment.  
Patients with a CR may continue on therapy for up to 2 cycles until a confirmatory scan is 
undertaken. If patients upon a confirmed CR prog ress they may continue therapy on a second 
course of therapy the combination until toxicity, progression. These subjects will be eligible 
for re-treatment for up to one year with MK- 3475 and vorinostat after they have experienced 
radiographic disease progression at the discretio n of the investigator according to the criteria 
in Section 5.1.4; this re-treatment will be th e Second Course Phase.  Response or progression 
in the Second Course Phase will not count towards the ORR and PFS of the primary endpoint 
in this trial.   
After the end of treatment, each patient will  be followed for a minimum of 30 days for 
adverse event monitoring (serious adverse events  will be collected for up to 90 days after the 
end of treatment).  Subjects will have post-treatment follow-up for disease status until death, 
withdrawing consent, or becoming lost to follow-up.   
Participation in this trial w ill be dependent upon supplying tumor tissue from either a newly 
obtained formalin-fixed specimen, or an olde r formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimen 
from locations not radiated prior to biopsy. Newly obtained formalin-fixed specimens are 
strongly encouraged unless clinically contrain dicated as deemed by the treating physician. If 
new scientific data emerge that indicate that  an existing biopsy or surgical specimen is 
suboptimal for identification of patients, only new biopsies will be acceptable for 
determination of PD-L1 status.  The specimen will be evaluated at a central laboratory 
facility for expression status of PD-L1 in a prospective manner.   
2.1.2.1 Safety assessments during the Phase II expansion 
 This investigator initia ted study will be under the oversight of the Fred 
Hutchinson/University of Washington Can cer Consortium IRB and Data and Safety 
Monitoring committee. The i nvestigators are ultimately responsible for monitoring the safety of 
patients who have entered this study and for alerting the Consortium IRB to any event that seems 
unusual in accordance with IRB policy. The investigator is responsible for the appropriate 
medical care of patients during the study. The investigator remains responsible to follow, through 
an appropriate health care option, adverse events that are serious or that caused the patient to 
discontinue before completing the study. The patient should be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes. Frequency of follow-up is left to the discretion of the investigator.  
Safety measurements that will be used in the study include physical examinations and 
clinical laboratory tests (hematology and blood chemistries). The adverse event will be graded 
for toxicity using the NCI CTC version 4.0. Toxicity assessment will occur at the start of each 
cycle, or more frequently if clinically indicated. Any adverse events leading to a treatment interruption or dose reduction along with all adverse events that are grade 3 and higher will be 
recorded in the CRF. Adverse Events that meet Merck’s definition of Event of Clinical Interest 
(refer to the Pembrolizumab ECI guidance document) will also be recorded. 
The criteria for dose de-escalation for adverse events are outlined in Section 5.2.  Any 
patient who requires two dose modifications or de-escalations will be taken off study.

PD-1 family of proteins.  
If part 2 is added the same objectives will apply. 
4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE 
4.1 Background 
4.1.1  Recurrent Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinomas 
Annually approximately 60,000 new diagnoses of s quamous cell carcinomas of the head and 
neck are diagnosed in  the United States.1 Tobacco and alcohol use are well recognized risk 
factors for the development of the disease, and marked socioeconomic disparity in the 
population at risk is well recognized.  Over the last decade, there has been an epidemiologic 
shift in this population, with the emergence of high risk HPV related oropharynx squamous 
cell carcinoma.2  This subset is unique in its molecu lar, pathologic and demographic features. 
The majority of patients presenting with squam ous cell carcinomas of the head and neck are 
diagnosed with locally advanced disease, with systemic metastasis being a late event. 
Although curative intent multimodality therapy is successful in a proportion of patients, most 
treatment failures are systemic.3   
Patients with systemic metastases, or have locoregional disease recurrence that is not amenable to local therapy such as salvage su rgery or radiation, have a poor prognosis, and a 
median survival of 6-9 months.  Over the past 3 decades, multiple clinical trials have failed to 
demonstrate a survival advantage of combin ation chemotherapy to single agent therapy 
alone.
4-6  More recently the phase III EXTREME st udy, revealed a survival advantage to the 
administration of a platinum, 5-FU and cetuxima b triplet compared to the platinum and 5-FU 
doublet.7  Despite this, the regimen was associated with Grade 3 and higher toxicity in 80%

of patients enrolled, making it a difficult regimen to tolerate in this patient population with 
already significant comorbidity. 
There is an urgent need to identify active,  well tolerated agents in RMSCC. Immune 
checkpoint inhibition is a promising avenue in  novel therapeutics in this disease, with a 
significant proportion of these malignancies expressing PD-L1 and robust populations of 
tumor infiltrating lymphocytes.  Preliminary reports of activity  of MK-3475 in this disease 
has led to expansion of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas in ongoing studies.8  
 4.1.2.  Salivary Gland Malignancies Salivary gland carcinomas represent <5% of all head and neck malignancies and are 
characterized by marked morphologi c and biologic diversity.  Th ese arise from the secretory 
acini and associated myoepithelial cells in the three paired major salivary glands, and minor 
salivary glands located throughout the upper aer odigestive epithelium.  The current WHO 
histological classification iden tifies 24 subtypes, with the most  common being adenoid cystic 
carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, saliv ary duct carcinomas and adenocarcinomas.
9  
The current standard of care for early or locally  advanced disease is curative intent resection 
followed by adjuvant radiation for tumo rs at high risk for recurrence. 10 
Currently, there is no standard of care for th e treatment of incurable (unresectable and 
metastatic)  salivary gland malignancies.  Clinic al trials that have examined the activity of 
systemic therapy have been difficult to interpre t due to small numbers,  heterogeneous patient 
populations, and the frequent observation of prol onged stable disease, a likely reflection of 
the  indolent biology of certain sa livary gland tumors, such as adenoid cystic carcinomas.   
Historical regimens tested more than 20 ye ars ago have employed ci splatin and cisplatin-
based combinations (respons e rates of 20% or lower).11  Two of the largest contemporary 
studies conducted in North America have exam ined single agent paclitaxel (response rate 
26% in non-adenoid cystic carcinoma subtypes, 0 in adenoid cystic carcinomas), and a gemcitabine carboplatin combin ation (response rate 24%).
12, 13 In these two studies median 
progression free survival was 5-6 months and median overall  survival was 12-14 months, 
(KM estimates of 1 year overall survival 50% , 3 year overall survival 25%.)  Even lower 
response rates have been demonstrated with pr ospective evaluation of the activity of various 
molecular targeted agents such as trastuzumab, gefitinib, imatinib and lapatinib, with essentially no objective response rates noted.
14-17 
Immunotherapy and anti-PD-1 targeted approaches  are unexplored in this disease. Despite 
the disease’s infrequency, this popu lation is overrepresented in our tertiary clinical practice.  
Another advantage to studying th is disease is the often a bundant archived tissue (most 
patients undergo upfront curative intent rese ction) and the relative ease of obtaining 
additional tissue from accessible anatomical lo cations (upper aerodigestiv e tract and cervical 
lymph nodes). 
Vorinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that has been studied in adenoid cystic 
carcinomas. 18 There is preclinical data  suggesting that HDAC inhibi tors alter th e biology of 
regulatory T cells and may increase tumor PD-L1 expression.19-21There is provocative

clinical data in NSCLC which suggests that epigenetic thera py may have synergistic activity 
with anti-PD-1 therapy.22    
The Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for MK-3475 a nd the package insert for vorinostat provide 
comprehensive background information on the mechanism of action of the mAb and the non-
clinical data, including PK, pharmacodynamics, safety profile and anti-tumor activity of 
these two agents. 
This study proposes the combination of vorinos tat and MK-3475, with the goal of assessing 
the safety and tolerab ility of the combination.  The st udy design will incorporate research 
serum and tissue collection for biomarker studies.  Safety data a nd objective response rates of 
this combination will be used to determine if further study of the combination will be 
pursued. 
4.1.3 Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background 
4.1.3.1 MK-3475 
The importance of intact immune surveillan ce in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades.23  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor-infiltrating lympho cytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies.24-28  In particular, the presence of CD 8+ T-cells and the ratio of CD8+ 
effector T-cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and 
long-term survival in many solid tumors. 
The PD-1 receptor-ligand interaction is a ma jor pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress 
immune control.  The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T-
cells under healthy conditions, is to down- modulate unwanted or excessive immune 
responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1) is an Ig 
superfamily member related to CD28 and C TLA-4 which has been shown to negatively 
regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD-L2)].  The structure of murine PD-1 has been reso lved.  PD-1 and family members are type I 
transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig  Variable-type (V-type) domain responsible 
for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling 
molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 c ontains 2 tyrosine-based  signaling motifs, an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition mo tif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-
based switch motif (ITSM).  Fo llowing T-cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine 
phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 to th e ITSM motif within its cyt oplasmic tail, leading to the 
dephosphorylation of effector  molecules such as CD3 ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70 which are 
involved in the CD3 T-cell signaling cascad e. The mechanism by which PD-1 down 
modulates T-cell responses is similar to, but dist inct from that of CTLA-4 as both molecules 
regulate an overlapping set of  signaling proteins. PD-1 was shown to be expressed on 
activated lymphocytes includi ng peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, T regs and 
natural killer cells. Expression has also b een shown during thymic development on CD4-
CD8- (double negative) T-cells as well as subs ets of macrophages and de ndritic cells].  The 
ligands for PD-1 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) are const itutively expressed or can be induced in a

variety of cell types, including non-hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors.  Both 
ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV- and IgC-like domains in the 
extracellular region and contain short cytopl asmic regions with no known signaling motifs.  
Binding of either PD-1 ligand to PD-1 inhibits  T-cell activation triggered through the T-cell 
receptor.  PD-L1 is expressed at low leve ls on various non-hematopoietic tissues, most 
notably on vascular endothelium , whereas PD-L2 protein is on ly detectably expressed on 
antigen-presenting cells  found in lymphoid tissue or chroni c inflammatory environments.  
PD-L2 is thought to control im mune T-cell activation in ly mphoid organs, whereas PD-L1 
serves to dampen unwarranted T-cell function in peripheral tissues.  Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD-L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T-cell inhibitor.  PD-1 has been suggested to regul ate tumor-specific T-cell 
expansion in subjects with melanoma (MEL).  This suggests that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway 
plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be cons idered as an attractive target 
for therapeutic intervention. 
MK-3475 (previously known as SCH 900475) is a potent and highly selective humanized 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the 
interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. 
4.1.3.2 Vorinostat 
Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are enzymes that catalyze the removal of  acetyl groups from 
the lysine residues of proteins , including histones and transcri ption factors. HDAC inhibitors 
can induce tumor cell growth arrest, differentia tion, or apoptosis in vitro and inhibit tumor 
growth in animals. The transcription of genes is regulated at least in  part by acetylation of 
nucleosomal histones. The core nucleosomal hi stones are the most wi dely studied of the 
proteins that become acetylated following inhibition of HDAC activity12. In some cancer 
cells, there is an overexpressi on of HDACs, or an aberrant  recruitment of HDACs to 
oncogenic transcription factors causing  hypoacet ylation of core nucleosomal histones.  
Hypoacetylation of histones is associated with a condensed chromatin structure and 
repression of gene transcripti on. Inhibition of HDAC activity allows for the accumulation of 
acetyl groups on the histone lysine residues re sulting in an open chromatin structure and 
transcriptional activation.  
Vorinostat is a potent inhibitor of HDAC activity and binds directly to the catalytic pocket of 
HDAC  enzymes. Vorinostat, at low nanomolar  concentrations, inhibits the enzymatic 
activity of HDAC1,  HDAC2 and HDAC3 (Cla ss I) and HDAC6 (Class II). Concentrations 
of vorinostat that cause the accu mulation of acetylated histones also induces cell cycle arrest, 
differentiation or apoptosis of transformed cells.  Vorinostat induces apoptosis in a wide 
variety of transformed cells in culture, including cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) cell lines, circulating atypical T-ce lls derived from patients with CTCL, human lymphoma cell 
lines and murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. Vorinostat also inhibits proliferation of 
cultured transformed human cells derived from leukemias, non-small cell lung carcinomas, colon carcinomas, central nervous  system tumors, melanomas, ova rian carcinomas,renal cell 
carcinomas, prostate and breast cancers. In cultured human transformed cell lines, vorinostat

has synergistic or additive activity in combination with other cancer therapies, including 
radiation, kinase inhibitors, cytotoxi c agents and differentiating agents.  
In 2006 vorinostat received approval for cuta neous T-Cell lymphoma. Vorinostat has been 
clinically tested in clinical trials in ma ny different solid and liq uid tumor histologies 
including ongoing head and neck cancer ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] - Capecita bine and Vorinostat in

4.2 Rationale 
4.2.1 Rationale for the Trial and Selected Subject Population 
For Cohort 1 Advanced incurable RMHNSCC carries  a poor prognosis.  Immune checkpoint 
modulation using monoclonal anti bodies are undergoing active exploration in this group of 
malignancies.  Preliminary data  reported in abstract form in 2014 revealed that 78% of 
RMSCC screened for an ongoing MK- 3475 phase Ib study, expressed PD-L1.8  There have 
been observations of disease responses in th is cohort of 60 patients, many of whom have 
been heavily pretreated with prior systemic agents. 
For Cohort 2 Patients with RMSGC have limited ther apeutic options.  Immune checkpoint 
modulation using monoclonal anti bodies are unexplored in th is group of malignancies and 
represent a promising treatment st rategy. Prior clinical trials e xploring the activity of various 
systemic chemotherapy agents and targeted agen ts have produced cons istently poor objective 
response rates.11-17   One of the challenges in clinical  trial design and interpretation among 
salivary gland malignancies is th e innate heterogeneity in th e biological behavior of the 
various subtypes.  Appropriate patient selectio n to account for the inherent differences in 
tumor biology is critical in defining drug activity  in this disease. Therefore this study will 
enroll the most common aggressi ve subtypes of salivary gl and malignancies, and require

An intriguing avenue in the st udy of immune checkpoint inhibito rs relates to potentiating the 
anti-tumor effect of the immunotherapy ag ents through various mechanisms such as 
augmenting T cell tumor infiltration, releasin g cancer cell antigen and improving cancer 
antigen presentation using various chemokine s, cytotoxic agents and vaccines.    
Histone deacetylase inhibitors ar e a unique subset of therapeutic agents that as single agents 
appear to have cytotoxic activity in select solid and hematologic malignancies.17,29  There is 
increasing preclinical data suggesting that HDAC  inhibitor exposure, promotes APC function 
and proliferation of intratumoral cytotoxic T cell s.  There is also preclinical data supporting a 
reversal of epigenetic silenc ing of critical genes responsible for augmenting innate and 
adaptive immunity, as well as increased tumo ral PD-L1 expression after NSCLC tumor cell 
line exposure to HDAC inhibition.19,20 Objective and prolonged di sease responses have been 
reported in patients with nonsmall cell l ung cancer receiving anti-PDL-1/antiPD-1 
monoclonal antibodies.22 Evidence suggests that epigenetic modification of tumors may also 
enhance tumor antigenicity.21 
 
4.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification   
An open-label Phase I trial (KEYNOTE-001) is being conducted to eval uate the safety and 
clinical activity of single agent pembroli zumab (MK-3475). The dose escalation portion of 
this trial evaluated three dos e levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 
weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced soli d tumors. All three dose levels were well 
tolerated and no dose-limiting t oxicities were observed. Th is first in human study of 
pembrolizumab (MK-3475) showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of 
tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg /kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/ kg Q2W). No MTD has 
been identified. 
 
In KEYNOTE-001, several randomized cohort evalua tions of melanoma subjects receiving 
pembrolizumab (MK-3475) at doses of 2 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg Q3W have been completed, 
and dose intervals of Q3W versus Q2W have also  been completed. The clinical efficacy and 
safety data demonstrate a lack of clinically  important differences in efficacy response or 
safety profile at either dose or either interval.  PK data analysis of pembrolizumab admini stered Q2W and Q3W s howed slow systemic 
clearance, limited volume of  distribution, and a long ha lf -life (refe r to IB). 
Pharmacodynamic data (IL-2 release assay) sugg ested that peripheral ta rget engagement is 
durable (>21 days). This early PK and pharm acodynamic data provides scientific rationale 
for testing a Q3W dosing schedule. Because Q3W dosing is more convenient for patients, Q3W dosing has been selected for all pembrolizumab studies. 
 
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropr iate dose for fixed dosing is based on 
simulations performed using a population PK mo del of pembrolizumab which revealed that 
the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks provides exposures that 1) are optimally consistent 
with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient

exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal 
efficacy response and 3) will maintain individu al patients exposure in the exposure range 
established in melanoma that are well tole rated and safe. KEYNOTE-012 initially studied 
subjects using the 10 mg/kg every three week s. An expansion cohort of an additional 100 
patients with HNSCC has enrolled using the fixed 200 mg every three week dosing. Safety 
and efficacy assessment of this cohort is ongoing. 
 A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and to reduce potential for dosing errors. A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity in the logistical chain at treatme nt facilities and reduce wastage. 
 
4.2.3 Rationale for Endpoints 
Both vorinostat and MK-3475 appear to be well  tolerated as a single agents and have FDA 
approved doses and indications.  These two drugs have non-overlapping mechanisms of 
action.  There has been no reported clinical ex perience with the comb ination of vorinostat 
and MK-3475. Therefore a phase I/II design, wherein a limited phase I run in cohort is 
initially enrolled, was felt to be most appropriate to study this combination, with safety and 
tolerability as the primary endpoint of interest. 
4.2.3.1 Efficacy Endpoints 
There is intriguing preclinical and clinical data s uggesting that epigene tic priming through 
HDAC inhibition may induce expression of PD-1 expression in tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes and augment the immunologic an ti-tumor response to MK-3475.  Therefore 
exploring objective response ra tes to the combination of MK-3475 and vorinostat will be 
secondary endpoints.  Over all survival and progression free su rvival will be examined in the 
entire cohort enrolled.   If encouraging response rates, a nd overall and progression free 
survival are observed in this cohort of patients, further study of the combination in this 
disease will be justified. 
4.2.3.2 Biomarker Research 
Archival tissue will be collected from all pa tients participating in the study. Every attempt 
will be made to obtain fresh tissue after tr eatment with 3 cycles of the MK-3475 and 
vorinostat combination regardless of response to treatment. These samples will be submitted 
to Merck for tissue based assays. 
Research serum samples will be obtained at the following timepoints ba seline, after 3 cycles 
MK-3475 and vorinostat and at treatment disc ontinuation or disease progression. We intend 
to perform flow cytometric  evaluation of CD 3, CD4, CD8, CD14, PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2 on 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

5.0 METHODOLOGY 
5.1 Entry Criteria for Treatment at Trial Entry 
5.1.1 Diagnosis/Condition for Entry into the Trial 
Phase I run in: biopsy proven RMHNSCC with the following primary sites: 
nasopharynx, paranasal sinus, nasa l cavity, skin/cutaneous sites.  Patients with unknown head 
and neck primary sites will be enrolled.  Patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell 
carcinomas of the head and neck (regardless of primary site) who ar e either unwilling to 
receive or have contraindica tions (deemed by treating physic ian) to standard systemic 
chemotherapy will also be eligible. Patients with biopsy proven RMSGC be eligible as well. 
Since our center will be participating in a separate MK-3475 clin ical trial (Keynote-
40), the above group of patient will be priori tized for the phase I run in portion, and avoid 
overlap with Keynote -40. 
Phase II expansion: biopsy proven RMHNS CC of any primary site (including 
unknown primary) and RMSGC will be eligible.

The MK-3475 dosing interval may be increased due to toxicity as described in Section 5.2.1.2. 
 
Patients will initiate vorinostat at 400mg daily on the same day as MK-3475 200 mg IV Q21 
days infusion.  Vorinostat should be taken within 30 minutes of a meal.   Vorinostat will be 
continued 5 out of 7 days throughout  each week of the 21 day cycle. 
Radiographic imaging (RECIST 1.1 and IrRC) will be complete d at a minimum of 9 weeks 
of starting the MK-3475 and vorinostat combina tion.  Patients who have objective responses 
or stable disease will conti nue therapy.  Patients who obtain  clinical benefit from the 
combination will be allowed to continue th erapy for a maximum of 2 years, or until 
progression or severe toxici ty, whichever comes first. 
Patients can be treated for a maximum of 2 cycl es before a confirmatory scan for a CR is 
performed. 
Patients who do not achieve a RE CIST 1.1 criteria objective res ponse at the first radiographic 
evaluation can continue the combination of vor inostat and MK-347 provided that they do not 
demonstrate clinical deterioration (defined by the following parameters and determined by 
the treating physician): 
1. Absence of signs and sympto ms of disease progression 
2. No decline in ECOG performance status 
3. Absence of rapid disease progression 
4. Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (e.g. cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternativ e medical intervention. 
Patients who receive a confirmed CR on trial may consider discontinuation of treatment.   Upon progression they can be retreated on a seco nd course of therapy according to Table 2.1. 
patients who progress on the second course of therapy are off study.  
5.2.1 Dose Selection/Modification 
5.2.1.1 Dose Selection 
The rationale for selection of dos e of MK-3475 to be used in this  trial is provided in Section 
4.0 – Background and Rationale.   
Since MK-3475 will be dosed as a flat dose th ere will be no requirement to calculate a 
dose/kg for each patient unless a dose reduction is needed.

The approved dose of vorinostat is 400mg QD for CTCL. However, published clinical 
experience in additional clinical trials has suggested that dosing at 400 mg 5 out of 7 days 
reduces toxicity and increases tolerability of the drug comp ared to daily 400 mg use.  
Consequently, we propose the 5 out 7 day schedule for this trial.   
5.2.1.2  Dose Modifications for MK-3475 and Vorinostat 
Toxicity will be graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE version 4.0). The protocol will change to CTCAE version 5.0 if is published within 
the course of the trial.  
Because it there may be overlap in the toxicities of both agents, and difficulty in attributing 
toxicity to either agent, patients experiencing any Grade 3 toxicity (except those outlined in 
Table 3.1  and Section 5.2.1.4) or any Grade 4 toxicity will have both MK-3475 and 
vorinostat held until improvement of the adverse event to Grade 1 or baseline .  
Toxicity that requires more than two dose reductions or modifications of vorinostat will lead to discontinuation of the patient from the treatment phase of the study. Patients are not 
permitted to continue on vori nostat or MK-3475 dosing alone. In addition, no dose re-
escalations are allowed during the study period unless toxicitie s are resolved to grade 1. 
Justification will be recorded in the source documents  Before initiation of subsequent cycles, each pa tient will be evaluated for possible toxicities 
that may have occurred after the previous treatment.  All Grade 3 or 4 toxicities  
(except those specif ied in Table 3.1 and Secti on 5.2.1.4)  should resolve to Grade 1 or 
baseline before re-initiation of study treatment.  Dose modification will be made based on the 
toxicity with the gr eatest severity.

Some patients will experience diarrhea follo wing vorinostat or the combination, mild-
to-moderate in severity. To date, observati on of diarrhea has tended to increase in 
frequency with continued dosing; both site personnel and patients should be told of 
the possibility of increased diar rhea with continued cycles.  
 
All subjects who experience di arrhea should be advised to drink liberal quantities of 
clear fluids.  If sufficient oral  fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should 
be substituted via IV infusion.  Diarrhea should be managed aggressively , as Grade 2 Diarrhea may progress to 
Grade 3, necessitating interruptions in therapy. Consid eration regarding use of 
prophylactic and/or supportiv e care should be made upon the first observation of

Grade 1 or higher Diarrhea. Non-prescrip tion methods to improve diarrhea include: 
diet modification (increased fiber, certain brands of yogurt, such as Probiotics), and 
hydration. Anti-diarrheal prescriptions medications include: loperamide and 
diphenoxylate with atropine. Consider giving the patient a prescription for an 
antidiarrheals to be filled if need ed on the first day of therapy. 
 
 
2. Enterocolitis 
 
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of  enterocolitis (such 
as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of 
bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs  and ileus).  In symptomatic subjects, 
infectious etiologies should be ruled out, and if sympto ms are persistent and/or 
severe, endoscopic evaluati on should be considered. 
 In subjects with severe enterocolitis  (Grade 3), MK-3475 will be permanently 
discontinued and treatment with systemic cor ticosteroids should be initiated at a dose 
of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equi valent.  When symptoms improve to Grade 
1 or less, corticosteroid ta per should be started and con tinued over at least 1 month. 
 In subjects with moderate enterocolitis (Grade 2), MK-3475 should be withheld and 
anti-diarrheal treatment should be started.  If  symptoms are persistent for more than 
one week, systemic corticosteroids s hould be initiated (e.g., 0.5 mg/kg/day of 
prednisone or equivalent).  When sy mptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, 
corticosteroid taper should be started and continued over at least 1 month.  Regarding 
guidelines for continuing treatment with MK-3475, see Section 5.2.  Additional data regarding management of this immune related adverse event will be included in Appendix 12.8 
 
3. Nausea/Vomiting/Dehydration  
 
Grade 3  Nausea/Vomiting/Dehydration lasti ng >72 hours despite aggressive 
supportive care OR Grade 4 Nausea/ Vomiting/Dehydrati on(lasting any duration) 
will result in stepwise dose reduction as outlined in Tables 3.1. and 3.2. Until resolution of the toxicity to Grade 1 or less or to baseline, MK-3475 and vorinostat 
are  to be held.  
 
Supportive care for Nausea/Vomiting : Some patients will experience nausea 
following vorinostat or the combination, genera lly mild-to-moderate in severity. With 
subsequent cycles, many patients note that the sensation of nausea becomes less. Once documented nausea and/or vomiting has been observed, the use of antiemetics per institutional guidelines is strongly en couraged. Non-prescription methods to 
improve nausea include: antacids, antiulc er drugs, ginger ale or ginger lozenges. 
Encourage each patient to drink at leas t 2 liters of fluid each day to avoid 
dehydration. Anti-emetic prescriptions medications include: prochlorperazine,

lorazepam, or any of the 5-HT3 reuptak e inhibitors (grani setron; ondansetron; 
palonosetron; dolasetron; or tropisetron). Consider giving  the patient a prescription 
for an anti-emetics to be filled if needed on the first day of therapy. 
 
Dehydration should be managed with aggressi ve hydration (either in travenous or oral 
fluids). Patients should be  strongly encouraged to main tain significant oral fluid 
intake. 
 
5.2.1.5 Initiation of subsequent cycles of therapy:  
 
 MK-3475 and vorinostat are to be started on the same day.  If an increase in MK-
3475 dosing interval is required according to  Table 3.1, vorinostat will be taken 5 out 
of 7 days for every week of the MK-3475 dosing interval.  
 
 A new course of treatment may begin on th e scheduled Day 1 of a new cycle if all 
non-hematological toxicity from the previous cycle has recovered to ≤Grade 1 or 
baseline, and/or hematologic recovery documented as outlined in section 5.2.1.4.  
 
Initiation of subsequent cycles of therapy may be delayed for up to 12 weeks to allow 
recovery from all drug-related toxicity. A lternately, the Investigator may choose to 
administer supportive care (blood product transfusions) for retreatm ent criteria to be met. If 
the recovery criteria are not met after a 12-week delay, the pa tient will be discontinued from 
study treatment unless, in the opinion of the Inve stigator, the patient is experiencing a clinical 
benefit, in which case a decision regarding continuation of treatment will be made on an 
individual patient basis in cons ultation with the Merck  medical monitor. Justification will be 
recorded in the source documents. 
 When initiating a subsequent cycle, a minimu m interval of 21 days should be observed 
between  MK-3475 administrations (with no minimum interval for vorinostat).  
 
Continuation of study therapy during a cycle: 
 
Within any cycle, the dose/schedule of either  study drug may be adjusted as necessary.   
 
5.2.2. Timing of Dose Administration 
Vorinostat and MK-3475 dose will both be initiate d on day 1 of each treatment cycle after all 
procedures/assessments have been completed as  detailed on the Trial Flow Chart (Section 
6.0).  Trial treatment may be admi nistered up to 3 days before or  after the scheduled Day 1 of 
each cycle due to administrative reasons. 
All trial treatments will be administ ered on an outpatient basis.

Oral vorinostat (400 mg) administered is onc e daily by mouth with food or within 0-30 
minutes after a meal (if possible) for days 1- 5 of each week in a week (21 day) treatment 
cycle. For any patient experien cing Grade 1 or higher drug-relate d fatigue, the Investigator 
should advise the patient to administer vorinostat prior to bedtime (See Section 3.2.6.3). On 
the day that MK-3475 is administered patien t should take vorinostat a minimum of 2 hours 
before the MK-3475 infusion.  
For patients unable to swallow pills, vori nostat will be administered as a 50mg/mL 
suspension.  This solution will be prepared by investigational pharmacy and administered via 
gastrostomy tube or nasogastric tube.  Gastro stomy tubes will be flushed with 20 mL of 
water before and after the suspension is admi nistered.  The dosing a nd dose reductions will 
follow Table 3.2. MK-3475 will be administered as a 30 minute IV  infusion (treatment cycle intervals may be 
increased due to toxicity as described in S ection 5.2.1.2).  Sites should make every effort to 
target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, given the 
variability of infusion pumps from site to site , a window of -/ +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., 
infusion time is 30 minutes: - /+10 min). 
5.3 Trial Blinding/Masking 
This is an open-label trial; therefore, the Sponsor, investigator, and subject will know the 
treatment administered. 
5.4 Randomization or Treatment Allocation 
All patients enrolled in this study will rece ive the combination of MK-3475 and vorinostat. 
5.5 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited) 
Medications or vaccinations sp ecifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial.  If ther e is a clinical indication for one  of these or other medications 
or vaccinations specifically prohibited during th e trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or 
vaccination may be required.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this 
with the Sponsor.  The final de cision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the 
investigator and/or the subject 's primary physician.  However, the decision to continue the 
subject on trial therapy or vaccination schedu le requires the mutual  agreement of the 
Investigator, the Sponsor, and the subject.  Hematopoetic growth factors will not be perm itted in patients enrolled on this study. 
5.5.1 Acceptable Concomitant Medications 
All treatments that the investigator consid ers necessary for a subject’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of  the investigator in keeping w ith the community standards of 
medical care.

Pembrolizumab ECI guidance document regarding diagnosis and management of 
adverse experiences of a poten tial immunologic etiology.   
 Management of Infusion Reactions:  Acute infusion reactions (which can include cytokine release syndrome, angioedema, or anaphylaxis) are different from allergic/hypersensitiv e reactions, although some of the manifestations are common to 
both AEs.  Signs and symptoms  usually develop during or shortly after drug infusion 
and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of comple tion of infusion. 
Signs/symptoms may include: Allergic reaction/hypersensitivity (including drug 
fever); Arthralgia (joint pain); Bronchospasm; Cough; Dizziness; Dyspnea (shortness 
of breath); Fatigue (asthenia, lethar gy, malaise); Headache; Hypertension; 
Hypotension; Myalgia (muscle pain); Naus ea; Pruritis/itching; Rash/desquamation; 
Rigors/chills; Sweating (diaphoresis); T achycardia; Tumor pain (onset or 
exacerbation of tumor pain due to treatm ent); Urticaria (hives, welts, wheals); 
Vomiting.

5.6.1.1 Supportive Care Guidelines for Events of Clinical Interest and Immune-related 
Adverse Events (irAEs) 
Events of clinical interest of a potential immuno logic etiology (irECIs) may be defined as an 
adverse event of unknown etiology, associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an 
immune phenomenon.  irAEs may be predic ted based on the nature of the MK-3475 
compound, its mechanism of action, and reported experi ence with immunoth erapies that have 
a similar mechanism of action.  Special attention should be paid to AEs that may be 
suggestive of potential irAEs.  An irAE can occur shortly af ter the first dose or several 
months after the last dose of treatment.   
If an irAE is suspected, efforts should be ma de to rule out neoplastic , infectious, metabolic, 
toxin or other etiologic causes pr ior to labeling an adverse event as an irAE.  Information on 
how to identify and evaluate irAEs has been de veloped and is included in the Pembrolizumab 
Event of Clinical Interest Guidance Docu ment.Subjects who develop a Grade 2 or higher 
irAE should be discussed immedi ately with the Sponsor.    
Recommendations to managing irAE s not detailed elsewhere in the protocol are detailed in

5.6.1.2 Supportive Care Guidelines for Pneumonitis 
Subjects with symptomatic pneumonitis shoul d immediately stop receiving MK-3475 and 
have an evaluation.  The evaluation may incl ude bronchoscopy and pulmonary function tests 
to rule out other causes such as infection.   
If the subject is determined to have study drug associated pneumonitis, the suggested 
treatment plan is detailed in Table 7.

5.7 Diet/Activity/Other Considerations 
5.7.1 Diet 
Subjects should maintain a norma l diet unless modifications ar e required to manage an AE 
such as diarrhea, nausea or vomiting. Patients on vorinostat are expected to take 2 L of fluid 
per day.  
5.7.2 Contraception 
MK-3475 and vorinostat may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero.  Furthermore, it is not 
known if MK-3475 has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm.  Non-
pregnant, non-breast-feeding women may be enro lled if they are willing to use 2 methods of 
birth control or are considered highly unlikely to conceive.  Highly unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a woman who is ≥45 years of age 
and has not had menses for greater than 1 year will be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not 
heterosexually active for the duration of the st udy.  The two birth control methods can be 
either two barrier methods or a barrier met hod plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. 
Subjects should start using birth control from  study Visit 1 throughout the study period up to 
120 days after the last dose of study therapy.  
Female patients of childbearing potential mu st have a negative serum pregnancy test ( β-hCG) 
within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of vorinostat and should either be post-
menopausal, free from menses for > 2 years, surgic ally sterilized, or willing to use 2 reliable 
forms of contraception  simultaneously, unl ess abstinence is the chosen method of 
contraception, starti ng with visit 1.   
Vorinostat may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero.  Furthermore, it is not known if 
vorinostat has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm.  Adequate contraception 
must be used by all patients (both male and fe male) and their partners during therapy with 
vorinostat, and for 30 days after the comple tion of study drug administration.  Women of 
childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregna nt while receiving 
treatment with vorinostat.     The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contracepti on: diaphragm, condom 
(by the partner), copper intrau terine device, sponge, or spermicide.  Appropriate hormonal 
contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an 
estrogen and/or a progestational agent (incl uding oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or 
intramuscular agents). Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to 
the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to o ccur during the study.  In order to participate 
in the study they must adhere to the cont raception requirement (described above) for the 
duration of the study and during the follow-up period defined in sect ion 7.2.2-Reporting of 
Pregnancy and Lactation to the Sponsor and to Me rck.  If there is any question that a subject

will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that subject should not be 
entered into the study. 
5.7.3 Use in Pregnancy 
If a subject inadvertently becomes pregna nt while on treatment with MK-3475 and/or 
vorinostat, the subject will immediately be remo ved from the study.  The site will contact the 
subject at least monthly and document the subj ect’s status until th e pregnancy has been 
completed or terminated.  The outcome of the pr egnancy will be reported to the Sponsor and 
to Merck without delay and with in 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience 
(e.g., death, abortion, congenital an omaly, or other disabling or life-threatening complication 
to the mother or newborn).  The study inve stigator will make ev ery effort to obtain 
permission to follow the outcome of the pregna ncy and report the condition of the fetus or 
newborn to the Sponsor.   If a male subject  impregnates his female partner the study 
personnel at the site must be informed i mmediately and the pre gnancy reported to the 
Sponsor and to Merck and followed as described above and in Section 7.2.2. 
It is not known if vorinostat may cause fetal ha rm when administered to  a pregnant woman.  
There are no adequate and well-controlled stud ies of vorinostat in pregnant women.  Results 
of animal studies indicate that vorinostat crosse s the placenta and is found in fetal plasma at 
levels up to 50% of maternal concentrations.  Doses up to 50 and 150 mg/kg/day were tested 
in rats and rabbits, respectively (~0.5 times  the human exposure based on AUC0-24 hours).  
Treatment-related developmenta l effects including decreased mean live fetal weights, 
incomplete ossifications of the skull, thorac ic vertebra, sterna, an d skeletal variations 
(cervical ribs, supernumerary ribs, vertebral coun t and sacral arch variations) in rats at the 
highest doses of vorinostat test ed.  Reductions in mean live fetal weight and an elevated 
incidence of incomplete ossification of the me tacarpals were seen in rabbits dosed at 150 
mg/kg/day.   
The no observed effect levels (NOELs) for th ese findings were 15 and 50 mg/kg/day (<0.1 
times the human exposure based on AUC) in rats and rabbits, respectively.  A dose related 
increase in the incidence of ma lformations of the gall bladder was noted in all drug treatment 
groups in rabbits versus the concurrent control.   If the drug is used during pregnancy, or if 
the patient becomes pregnant while taking this  drug, the patient should be apprised of the 
potential hazard to the fetus. 
5.7.4 Use in Nursing Women 
It is unknown whether MK-3475 is excreted in hu man milk.  Since many drugs are excreted 
in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing 
infant, subjects who are breast-feedi ng are not eligible for enrollment. 
It is not known whether vorinostat is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are 
excreted in human milk and beca use of the potential for serious adverse r eactions in nursing 
infants from vorinostat, a de cision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or 
discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

5.8 Subject Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria 
Subjects may withdraw consent at  any time for any reason or be dropped from the trial at the 
discretion of the investigator s hould any untoward effect occur.  In addition, a subject may be 
withdrawn by the investigator or the Sponsor if enrollment into the trial is inappropriate, the 
trial plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reas ons.  Specific details 
regarding discontinuation or withdrawal are provided in Section 7.1.4 – Other Procedures. 
A subject must be discontinued from th e trial for any of the following reasons: 
 The subject or legal represen tative (such as a parent or  legal guardian) withdraws 
consent. 
 Confirmed radiographic disease progression 
Note : For unconfirmed radiographic diseas e progression, please see Section 5.2.2 
Note : A subject may be granted an excepti on to continue on treatment with 
confirmed radiographic progression if clinically stable or clinically improved, 
please see Section 7.2.1.6 
 Unacceptable adverse experiences as described in Section 5.2.1.2 
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment 
 Investigator’s decision to  withdraw the subject 
 The subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test 
 Noncompliance with trial treatme nt or procedure requirements 
 The subject is lost to follow-up 
 Completed 24 months of treatment with MK-3475 
Note: 24 months of study medication is calcul ated from the date of  first dose. Subjects 
who stop MK-3475 after 24 months may be e ligible for up to one year of additional 
study treatment if they progress after stopping  study treatment prov ided they meet the 
requirements detailed in Section 5.1.4 
 Administrative reasons 
The End of Treatment and Follow-up visit procedur es are listed in Section 6 (Protocol Flow 
Chart) and Section 7.1.5 (Visit Requirements).  After the end of treatment, each subject will 
be followed for 30 days for adverse event monitoring (serious adverse events will be collected for 90 days after the end of treatment as describe d in Section 7.2.3.1).  Subjects 
who discontinue for reasons other than progressive disease will have post-treatment follow-

up for disease status until disease progression, initiating a non-study cancer treatment, 
withdrawing consent or becoming lost to follow-up.   
After documented disease progression each subj ect will be followed by telephone for overall 
survival until death, withdrawal of consent, or  the end of the study, wh ichever occurs first. 
5.9 Subject Replacement Strategy 
Replacement of Patients in DLT Period 
Patients who received <90% of  the MK-3475 infusion in Cycle 1 (e.g., because the infusion 
had to be discontinued due to an infusion reactio n) and did not experience a DLT will not be 
taken into account in the assess ment of the overall DLT rate for the phase I run in cohort and 
need to be replaced. 
If a patient experiences a DLT in Cycle 1, study therapy may be discontinued following 
discussion and agreement between the Sponsor and Investigator.  An alternative 
consideration may be dose modifications of Vorinostat and MK-3475 as described in Section 
5.2.1.2  with continued therapy. 
Specific procedures to be performed during the tr ial, as well as their prescribed times and 
associated visit windows, are outlined in the Tr ial Flow Chart - Section 6.0. Details of each 
procedure are provided in Sec tion 7.0 – Trial Procedures. 
5.10 Clinical Criteria for Early Trial Termination 
Early trial termination will be the result of the criteria specified below: 1. Quality or quantity of data recording is inaccurate or incomplete 
2. Poor adherence to protocol and regulatory requirements 
3. Incidence or severity of adverse drug reaction in this or other studies indicates a potential 
health hazard to subjects 
4. Plans to modify or discontinue the development of the study drug 
In the event of Merck decision to no longe r supply study drug, ample notification will be 
provided so that appropriate adjustment s to subject treatment can be made.

7.0 TRIAL PROCEDURES 
7.1 Trial Procedures 
The Trial Flow Chart - Section 6.0 summarizes th e trial procedures to be performed at each 
visit.  Individual trial procedur es are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to 
perform these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by the 
investigator. 
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by the Sponsor and/or 
Merck for reasons related to s ubject safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be 
potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulations may 
require that additional informed consent be obtained from the subject.  In these cases, such 
evaluations/testing will be performed in  accordance with those regulations. 
7.1.1 Administrative Procedures 
7.1.1.1 Informed Consent 
The Investigator must obtain documented cons ent from each potential subject prior to 
participating in a clinical trial. 
7.1.1.1.1  General Informed Consent 
Consent must be documented by the subject’s dated signature or by the subject’s legally 
acceptable representative’s dated signature on a consent form along with the dated signature 
of the person conducting th e consent discussion.  
A copy of the signed and dated consent form  should be given to the subject before 
participation in the trial. 
The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informed consent form 
and any written information provided to the subject must receive the IRB/ERC’s approval/favorable opinion in advance of use.  The subject or his/her legally acceptable 
representative should be informed in a timel y manner if new information becomes available 
that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness  to continue participation in the trial.  The 
communication of this information will be provided and documented via a revised consent 
form or addendum to the original consent form that captures the subject’s dated signature or 
by the subject’s legally acceptable re presentative’s dated signature. 
The informed consent will adhere to IRB/ERC re quirements, applicable laws and regulations 
and Sponsor requirements.

will include all active conditions, and any condition diagnosed within the prior 10 years that 
are considered to be clinically significant by the Investigator.  Detail s regarding the disease 
for which the subject has enrolled in this study will be recorded separately and not listed as 
medical history.   
7.1.1.4 Prior and Concomitant Medications Review 
7.1.1.4.1 Prior Medications 
The investigator or qualified designee will review prior medication use, including any 
protocol-specified washout requirement, and record prior medication taken by the subject 
within 28 days before starting the trial.  Treatment for the disease for which the subject has 
enrolled in this study will be recorded sepa rately and not listed as a prior medication.  
7.1.1.5 Disease Details and Treatments 
7.1.1.5.1 Disease Details 
The investigator or qualified designee will obtain prior and current details regarding disease status.  
7.1.1.5.2 Prior Treatment Details 
The investigator or qualified designee will review all prior cancer treatments including 
systemic treatments, radiation and surgeries. 
7.1.1.5.3 Subsequent Anti-Cancer Therapy Status 
The investigator or qualified designee will revi ew all new anti-neoplastic therapy initiated 
after the last dose of trial treatment.  If a subj ect initiates a new anti-cancer therapy within 30 
days after the last dose of trial treatment, the 30 day Safety Follow-up visit must occur before 
the first dose of the new therapy.  Once new anti -cancer therapy has been initiated the subject

7.1.1.7 Assignment of Randomization Number 
There is no randomization number. 
7.1.2 Clinical Procedures/Assessments 
7.1.2.1 Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring 
The investigator or qualified designee will assess each subject to evaluate for potential new 
or worsening AEs as specified in the Trial Fl ow Chart and more frequently if clinically 
indicated.  Adverse experiences will be grad ed and recorded throughout the study and during 
the follow-up period according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 (see Section 12.2).  Toxicities will be characterized in terms regarding seri ousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action 
taken with regard to trial treatment.  
All AEs of unknown etiology asso ciated with MK-3475 exposure should be evaluated to 
determine if it is possibly an event of clinical interest (ECI) of a potentially immunologic 
etiology (irAE).  See Section 5.6.1.1 and th e separate guidance document in the 
administrative binder regarding the identificatio n, evaluation and management of AEs of a 
potential immunologi cal etiology.   
Please refer to section 7.2 for detailed informa tion regarding the assessment and recording of 
AEs.   
7.1.2.2 Full Physical Exam 
The investigator or qualified designee will perform a complete physical exam during the 
screening period.  Clinically significant abnor mal findings should be recorded as medical 
history.  A full physical exam shoul d be performed during screening,  
7.1.2.3 Directed Physical Exam 
For cycles that do not require a full physical exam pe r the Trial Flow Char t, the investigator 
or qualified designee will perform a directed physical exam as clinically indicated prior to 
trial treatment administration.   
7.1.2.4 Vital Signs 
The investigator or qualified designee will ta ke vital signs at screening, prior to the 
administration of each dose of trial treatment an d at treatment discontinuation as specified in 
the Trial Flow Chart (Section 6.0).  Vital signs  should include temperat ure, pulse, respiratory 
rate, weight and blood pressure.

The investigator or qualified designee w ill assess ECOG status (see Section 12.4) at 
screening, prior to the administration of each do se of trial treatment and discontinuation of 
trial treatment as specified in the Trial Flow Chart.   
7.1.2.6 Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease 
Radiologic assessments of measurable disease w ill be performed using contrast CT imaging.  
RECIST 1.1 and IrRC criteria will be used to assess response to therapy.  Radiologic imaging 
will be performed every 9 weeks (63 +/- 7 days).   After completion of cycle #6, the intervals 
between radiographic evaluations can be extended to up to 12 weeks +/- 7 days, according to 
the discretion of th e treating physician.  
Radiographic imaging (RECIST 1.1 and IrRC) will be complete d at a minimum of 9 weeks 
(63 +/- 7 days) of starting the MK-3475 and vorinostat combination.  Patients who have 
objective responses or stable di sease will continue therapy.  Patients who obtain clinical 
benefit from the combination will be allowed to  continue therapy for a maximum of 2 years, 
or until progression or severe to xicity, whichever comes first. 
Patients can be treated for a maximum of 2 cycl es before a confirmatory scan for a CR is 
performed. 
Patients who do not achieve a RE CIST 1.1 criteria objective res ponse at the first radiographic 
evaluation can continue the combination of vor inostat and MK-347 provided that they do not 
demonstrate clinical deterioration (defined by the following parameters and determined by 
the treating physician): 
1. Absence of signs and sympto ms of disease progression 
2. No decline in ECOG performance status 
3. Absence of rapid disease progression 
4. Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (e.g. cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternativ e medical intervention. 
Patients who receive a confirmed CR on trial may consider discontinuation of treatment.   Upon progression they can be retreated on a seco nd course of therapy according to Table 2.1. 
patients who progress on the second course of therapy are off study.  
7.1.2.7 Tumor Tissue Collection and Correlative Studies Blood Sampling 
All patients will be required to submit archival  tissue as part of study participation.  In 
patients who do not have archival tissue, a pretreatment tumor biopsy will be performed, unless deemed contraindicated by the treating ph ysician.  Every attempt to obtain additional 
tumor biopsies will be performed after 3 cycl es of treatment are completed.  Similarly,

3. Directed physical examination 4. Vital signs and weight 5.  ECOG performance status 5. CBC  6. Comprehensive serum chemistry panel 6. Tumor Assessments of known sites of di sease (every 9 weeks; 63 +/- 7 days) 
7.1.5.3 Post-Treatment Visits 
7.1.5.3.1  Safety Follow-Up Visit  
The mandatory Safety Follow-Up Visit should be conducted approximate ly 30 days after the 
last dose of trial treatment or before the initiation of a new anti-cancer treatment, whichever comes first.  All AEs that occur prior to the Safety Follow-Up Visit should be recorded.   
7.1.5.4 Follow-up Visits 
Subjects who discontinue trial treatment for a reason other than disease progression will 
move into the Follow-Up Phase and should be  assessed every 8 weeks (56 ± 7 days) by 
radiologic imaging to monitor disease status.  Every effort should be made to collect 
information regarding disease status until the start of new anti-neoplastic therapy, disease 
progression, death, end of the study or if the subject begins  retreatment w ith MK-3475 as 
detailed in Section 7.1.5.2.1.  Information regarding post-study anti-neoplastic treatment will

7.2 Assessing and Recording Adverse Events 
An adverse event is defined as  any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceu tical product and which does not necessarily 
have to have a causal relationship with this tr eatment. An adverse event can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an  abnormal laboratory finding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-
specified procedure, whether or not considered  related to the medicinal product or protocol-
specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., a ny clinically significant adverse change in 
frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting co ndition that is temporally associated with the 
use of the Merck’s product, is  also an adverse event. 
Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary significantly in 
frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events.  
Examples of this may include, but are not lim ited to, teething, typica l crying in infants and 
children and onset of menses or menopause occurring at a physiologically appropriate time. 
Merck product includes any pharmaceutical produc t, biological product, device, diagnostic 
agent or protocol-specified procedure, whethe r investigational (including placebo or active 
comparator medication) or marketed, ma nufactured by, licensed by, provided by or 
distributed by Merck for human use. Adverse events may occur during the course of th e use of Merck product in  clinical trials or 
within the follow-up period specified by the protocol , or prescribed in clinical practice, from 
overdose (whether accidental or intenti onal), from abuse and from withdrawal. 
Adverse events will be recorded from the tim e the first dose of either vorinostat or MK-3475 
is administered through 30 days following cessa tion of treatment and at each examination on 
the Adverse Event case report forms/worksheets . After 30 days, advers e events related to 
either MP-3475 or vorinostat will be followed un til resolution or stabilization of the AE or 
until the beginning of a new anti-neoplastic therapy, whichever occurs first.  The reporting 
timeframe for adverse events meeting any seri ous criteria is described in section 7.2.3.1. 
Only adverse events that meet the following definition will be recorded. 
 All grade 3 and higher adverse events 
 Any adverse event the requires a dose reduction or dose delay of either MK-3475 or 
vorinostat 
 All adverse events that meet Merck’s definiti on of Event of Clinical Interest (refer to 
the separate Pembrolizumab ECI guidance document) 
 
7.2.1 Definition of an Overdose for This Prot ocol and Reporting of Overdose to the 
Sponsor and to Merck 
For purposes of this trial, an overdose will be defined as any dose exceeding the prescribed dose for MK-3475 by 20% over the pr escribed dose. No specific information is available on

the treatment of overdose of MK-3475. In the event of overdose, MK-3475 should be 
discontinued and the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate 
supportive treatment should be prov ided if clinic ally indicated. 
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“ results from”) the overdose of a Merck product, 
the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious  adverse event, even if no other seriousness 
criteria are met. 
If a dose of Merck’s product meeting the protocol  definition of overdos e is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal la boratory results, the overdose is reported as a 
non-serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional 
overdose without adverse effect.” 
An overdose for vorinostat will be defined as any dose of study drug(s) that is 10% or 
more over the prescribed dose per cycle as de scribed in the study protocol. No specific 
information is available on the treatment of overdose of vorinostat. There is no specific 
antidote for vorinostat overdose. In clinical studies, the highest total daily doses tested 
were 600 mg (once daily), 800 mg (400 mg twice daily) and 900 mg (300 mg three times 
daily). In four patients who took more than the recommended study dose (without exceeding the highest doses tested), no adverse experiences were reported. The 
pharmacological effects may be prolonged after serum levels of active vorinostat are no 
longer present. It is not known if vorinostat is dialyzable. In the event of overdose, vorinostat should be held and the patient should be observed closely for signs of 
toxicity. As clinically indica ted, appropriate supportive treatment should be provided, if 
applicable. 
 
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 hours 
to the Sponsor and within 2 working days hours to Merck Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide 
Product Safety; FAX 215 993-1220) 
7.2.2 Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation to the Sponsor and to Merck 
Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered adverse events, it is the responsibility of 
investigators or their design ees to report any pregnancy or lactation in a subject 
(spontaneously reported to them ), including the pregnancy of a male subject's female partner 
that occurs during the trial or within 120 days of completing the trial completing the trial, or 
30 days following cessation of treatment if the subject initiates ne w anticancer therapy, 
whichever is earlier.  All subjects and female partners of male subjects who become pregnant 
must be followed to the completion/termina tion of the pregnancy.  Pregnancy outcomes of 
spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, bl ighted ovum, fetal 
death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and sti llbirth must be reported as serious events 
(Important Medical Events ).  If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of 
infant) must also be reported.  
Such events must be reported within 24 hours to  the Sponsor and within 2 working days to 
Merck Global Safety. (Attn: Worl dwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993-1220)

7.2.3 Immediate Reporting of Adverse Events to the Sponsor and to Merck 
7.2.3.1 Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any use of 
Merck’s product that: 
 Results in death; 
 Is life threatening; 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
 Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization; 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
 Is a new cancer (that is no t a condition of the study); 
 Is associated with an overdose; 
 Is another important medical event  
 Overdose 
Refer to Table 10 for additional details regarding each of the above criteria. 
Progression of the cancer under study is no t considered an adverse event unless it 
results in hospitalization or death. 
Any serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious adverse event, including death due to 
any cause other than progression of the cancer under study that occurs to any subject from 
the time the consent is signed through 90 days following cessation of treatment, or the initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, whicheve r is earlier, whether or  not related to Merck 
product, must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to Merck Global Safety.  
Non-serious Events of Clinical Interest will be forwarded to Me rck Global Safety and will be 
handled in the same  manner as SAEs.  
Additionally, any serious adverse event, consid ered by an investigator who is a qualified 
physician to be related to Merck product that is brought to the attention of the investigator at 
any time outside of the time period specified in the previous paragraph also must be reported 
immediately to the Sponsor and to Merck. 
SAE reports and any other relevant safety info rmation are to be forwarded to the Merck 
Global Safety facsimile number:  +1-215-993-1220  
A copy of all 15 Day Reports and Annual Progre ss Reports is submitted as required by FDA, 
European Union (EU), Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices agency (PMDA) or other local 
regulators. Investigators will cross reference th is submission according to local regulations to 
the Merck Investigational Com pound Number (IND, CSA, etc.) at the time of submission.

All subjects with serious adverse ev ents must be followed up for outcome. 
7.2.3.2 Events of Clinical Interest 
Selected non-serious and serious ad verse events are also known as Events of Clinical Interest 
(ECI) and must be recorded as such on the A dverse Event case report forms/worksheets and 
reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and with in 2 working days to Merck Global Safety. 
(Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993-1220) 
Events of clinical interest for this trial include: 1.  an overdose of Merck product, as defined in  Section 7.2.1 - Definition of an Overdose for 
This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the Sponsor, that is not asso ciated with clinical 
symptoms or abnormal laboratory results.  2.  an elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of 
normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the upper 
limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phospha tase lab value that is less than 2X 
the upper limit of normal, as determined by way of protocol-specified laboratory testing or 
unscheduled laboratory testing.* 
*Note:  These criteria ar e based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require 
an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology.  Th e trial site guidance for 
assessment and follow up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Trial File 
Binder (or equivalent). 
3.  In the event a subject devel ops any of the following AEs, a detailed narrative of the event 
should be reported as an ECI to the Sponsor within 24 hours and to Merck Global Safety 
within 2 working days of the event: 
a.  Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea 
b.  Grade ≥   3 colitis 
c.  Grade ≥ 2 pneumonitis 
d.  Grade ≥  3 hypo- or  hyperthyroidism 
 
A separate guidance document has been provide d entitled “event of Clinical Interest and 
Immune-Related Adverse Event Guidance Document.”  This document provides guidance regarding identification, evaluati on and management of ECIs and irAEs.  Additional ECIs are 
identified in this guidance document and also need to be reported to  the Sponsor within 24 
hours and to Merck Global Safety within  2 working days of the event.   
Subjects should be assessed for possible ECIs pr ior to each dose.  Lab results should be 
evaluated and subjects should be asked for si gns and symptoms suggestive of an immune-

related event.  Subjects who develop an ECI thought to be immune-related should have 
additional testing to rule out other etiologic ca uses.  If lab results or  symptoms indicate a 
possible immune-related ECI, then  additional testing should be performed to rule out other 
etiologic causes.  If no other cause is found, then it is assumed to be immune-related.  
ECIs that occur in any subject from the date  of first dose through 90 days following cessation 
of treatment, or the initiation of a new antican cer therapy, whichever is earlier, whether or 
not related to the Merck’s product, must be re ported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and to 
Merck Global Safety within 2 working days. 
7.2.4 Evaluating Adverse Events 
An investigator who is a qualifie d physician will evaluate all a dverse events according to the 
NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Any adverse event 
which changes CTCAE grade over the course of a given episode will have each change of 
grade recorded on the adverse event case report forms/worksheets. 
All adverse events regardless of CTCAE grad e must also be evaluated for seriousness.

Table 10 Evaluating Adverse Events 
An investigator, who is a qualified physician, will evaluate all a dverse events as to: 
V4.0 CTCAE 
Grading Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mid symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.  
 Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive interven tion indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental ADL.
 Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation or hospitalizatio n indicated; 
disabling; limiting self-care ADL.
 Grade 4 Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.
 Grade 5 Death related to AE
Seriousness A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any use of Merck product that: 
 † Results in death ; or 
 † Is life threatening; or  places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediat e risk of death from the event as it occurred (Note: This does  not include an 
adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.); or 
 † Results in a persistent or si gnificant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions); or 
 † Results in or prolongs an exis ting inpatient hospitalization  (hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admi ssion, regardless of length of stay, even if the 
hospitalization is a precautionary measure for continued observa tion. (Note: Hospitalization [including hospitalization for an elective procedure] for a preexisting 
condition which has not worsened does not constitute a serious adverse event.); or 
 † Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  (in offspring of subject taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis);or 
 Is a new  cancer;  (that is not a condition of the study) or 
 Is an overdose  (whether accidental or intentional).  An y adverse event associated with an overdose is considered a serious adverse event. An overdose that is not 
associated with an adverse event is considered a non-serious event of clinical interest and must be reported within 24 hours.
 Other important medical events  that may not result in death, not be life threatening, or not  require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse even t when, 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed previously (designated above by a †). 
Duration Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less th an 1 day, indicate the appropriate length of time and units 
Action taken  Did the adverse event cause the Merck product to be discontinued? 
Relationship to test drug  Did the Merck product cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that the Merck product caused the adverse ev ent will be provided by an 
investigator who is a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that su pports the causality noted on the AE 
form, ensures that a medically qualified a ssessment of causality was done. This initiale d document must be retained for the req uired regulatory time frame. The 
criteria below are intended as reference guidelines to assist th e investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship be tween the test drug and the adverse event 
based upon the available information.  The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the Merck product and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and 
their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely the Merck product caused the adverse event (AE): 
 Exposure Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to th e Merck product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance a ssessment (pill 
count, diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or  measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen? 
 Time Course Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the Merck product?  Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug-induced effect (applies to trials with investigational medicinal product) ? 
 Likely Cause Is the AE not reasonably explained by another etiology such as underlying disease, other drug(s)/v accine(s), or other host or e nvironmental 
factors

Relationship The following components are to be used to asse ss the relationship between the test drug and the AE: (continued)
to Merck 
product 
(continued)  Dechallenge Was the Merck product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency reduced? 
If yes, did the AE resolve or improve? 
If yes, this is a positive dechallenge. If no, this is a negative dechallenge. 
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulte d in death or permanent disab ility; (2) the AE resolved/improved despite continuation 
of the Merck product; or (3) the trial is a single-dose drug trial); or (4) Merck product(s) is/are only used one time.) 
 Rechallenge Was the subject re-exposed to the Merck product in this study? 
If yes, did the AE recur or worsen? 
If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. If no, this is a negative rechallenge. 
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or permanent disability, or (2) the trial is a  single-dose drug trial); or 
(3) Merck product(s) is/are used only one time). NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN ADVERSE EVENT WHICH WAS SERIOUS AND WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE MERCK PRODUCT, OR IF REEXPOSURE TO THE MERCK PRODUCT POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE SUBJECT, THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE APPROVED IN ADVANCE BY THE U.S. CLINICAL MONITOR AS PER DOSE MODIFICATION GUIDELINES IN THE PROTOCOL. 
 Consistency with Trial Treatment Profile Is the clinical/pathological presentation of the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding the Merck product or drug clas s pharmacology 
or toxicology? 
The assessment of relationship will be reported on the case repor t forms /worksheets by an investigator who is a qualified phys ician according to his/her best  clinical judgment, including 
consideration of the above elements. 
Record one of the following  Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteri a must be present to be indicative of a Merck product relations hip).  
Yes, there is a reasonable possibility of Merck product relationship. There is evidence of exposure to the Merck product.  The temporal  sequence of the AE onset relative to the administration of the Merck product 
is reasonable.  The AE is more likely explai ned by the Merck product than by another cause.  
No, there is not a reasonable possibility Merck product relationship Subject did not receive the Merck product OR temporal sequence of  the AE onset relative to administration of the Merck product is not 
reasonable OR there is another obvious cause  of the AE.  (Also entered for a subject with overdose without an associated AE.)

8.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN 
8.1 Statistical Analysis Plan Summary 
The first 6 patients enrolled in this study will co nstitute the phase I component of the clinical 
trial.  All patients enrolled in the study will be analyzed for the safety and efficacy endpoints 
of the study. 
This will be a single arm phase II study which will enroll 35 patients in Cohort 1 and 35 
patients in Cohort 2.  All patients enrolled in the study (both in the phase I run in and phase II expansion) will be analyzed for the safety  and efficacy endpoints of the study. For both 
Cohorts, using a 1-sided 0.07 level (exact)  test  with a null hypothesis of 20% response rate 
to the MK-3475 and vorinostat combination, an alternative of 40%, a nd 89% power (exact), 
11/35 (31%) responses would be considered evid ence to rule out an RR of < 20%. With 35 
patients, frequencies can be estimated to within 17% with  95% confidence. 
 
8.2 Statistical Analysis Plan 
Toxicities will be summarized as the number and percentage of patients with each type of toxicity.  Responses will be summarized as freq uencies and percentages.  The Kaplan Meier 
methods will be used to estimate overall surv ival and progression free survival.  Outcomes 
will be calculated from the date of study en try to the date of the corresponding event.

 12.3 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid  Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 Criteria for 
Evaluating Response in Solid Tumors 
RECIST version 1.1* will be used in this study for assessment of tumor response. While 
either CT or MRI may be utilized, as per RE CIST 1.1, CT is the preferred imaging technique 
in this study.

12.4 Immune Response Criteria 
For all patients who experience disease progression on study, the date noted for of disease 
progression is the time of the scan where it is originally detected, and not the following date 
of the confirmatory scan. 
Definitions of measurable and non-measurable disease 
Measurable disease: Neoplastic masses that can be precisely measured in 2 in-plane 
perpendicular diameters. Both its longest diam eter and its longest pe rpendicular must be 
greater than or equal to 10 mm or 2 times the axial slice thickness. Lymph nodes must have a 
short-axis line-length of ≥ 15 mm.  Malignant lymph nodes must be measurable in 2 
perpendicular diameters. Both its longest diam eter and its longest pe rpendicular must be 
greater than or equal to 15 mm or 2 times the axial slice thickness.  The quantitative endpoint 
will be defined as the product of the longest  diameter with its longest perpendicular. 
Non-measurable disease : Non-measurable lesions are those that are not suitable for 
quantitative assessment over time. These include: 
1) Neoplastic masses that are too small to measure, because their longest uninterrupted 
diameter or longest perpendicu lar are less than 10 mm or two times the axial slice thickness. 
2) Neoplastic masses whose boundaries cannot be distinguished.  This includes masses which 
cannot be demarcated from surrounding tissue becau se of inadequate contrast, masses with 
overly complex morphology, or those with highly heterogeneous tissue composition. 
3) Other types of lesions that are confidently fe lt to represent neoplastic tissue, but difficult to 
quantify in a reproducible manner. These in clude bone metastases, leptomeningeal 
metastases, malignant ascites, pleural/pericardi al effusions, inflammatory breast disease, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesi ons, ill defined abdominal masses, etc. 
For irRC, only target lesions selected at ba seline and measurable new lesions are taken 
into account.

 At the baseline tumor assessment, the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular 
diameters (SPD) of all index lesions  (five lesions per organ, up to 10 visceral lesions and 
five cutaneous index lesions) is calculated. 
At each subsequent tumor assessment, the SPD of  the index lesions and of new, measurable 
lesions (≥5 X 5 mm; up to 5 new lesions per organ: 5 new cutaneous lesions and 10 visceral 
lesions) are added together to provide the total time-point tumor burden . 
Overall response using irRC: 
 Complete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all tumor lesions (whether 
measureable or not, and no new lesions).  CR must be confirmed by repeated, 
consecutive assessments made no less than 4 weeks from the date first documented. 
 Partial Response (irPR): Decrease in SPD of 50% or greater by a consecutive 
assessment at least 4 weeks after first documentation. 
 Stable Disease (irSD): Failure to meet criteria for irCR or irPR, in absence of irPD. 
 Progressive Disease (irPD): At least 25% increase in SPD relative to nadir 
(minimum recorded tumor burden) Confir mation by a repeat, consecutive assessment 
no less than 4 weeks from th e data first documented. 
Please note other key differences between  irRC and the original WHO criteria: 
New measurable lesions will be incorporated into the SPD New non measurable lesions do not de fine progression but  preclude irCR 
Non-index lesions contribute to defining irCR (complete disappearance required).

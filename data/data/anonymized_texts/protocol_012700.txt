2.Objectives 
Diabetes is common in patients in subacute and long-term skille d nursing care facilities.  Most 
patients with T2D are treated with insulin alone or in combinat ion with oral antidiabetic agents, 
with reported high rate of iatrogenic hypoglycemia 12,13. The rate of hypoglycemia in 
sulfonylureas and insulin treated patients is reported ~ 30-40% , and the development of 
hypoglycemia has been associated with greater resource utilizat ion and higher emergency 
room and hospital transfers compared to residents without hypog lycemia 44. The use of CGM 
has been shown superior to POC testing (standard of care) in de tecting both hypo- and hyper- 
glycemic events 21. The use of CGM with glucose telemetry system (CGM-GTS) with a larm 
reduces the frequency and time in hypoglycemia compared in insu lin treated patients with T2D 
compared to POC.  We propose to conduct a RCT to compare the ef ficacy of CGM-GTS in 
reducing hypoglycemia in high risk population with T2D treated with insulin and/or insulin-
secretagogues in subacute and long-term skilled nursing care fa cilities 
 3.Background 
Prevalence of diabetes in older adults and subacute and long-te rm skilled nursing care 
facilities.   The prevalence of diabetes increases with age, and it is esti mated that more than 
20% of older adults aged 65-75 years and 40% of adults >80years  of age have diabetes
29,30. The 
prevalence of diabetes in older adults is expected to increase due to longer life expectancy and 
improve care of the population30,31. The estimated prevalence of diabetes in subacute and long-
term skilled nursing care facilities is reported to be ~ 20% to  34%1, and in parallel to the 
increasing geriatric population, the number of LTC admissions i s expected to rise31.  
 
Diabetes treatment in LTC facilities.  The goals of diabetes care in older adults and in patients 
in subacute and long-term skilled nursing care facilities inclu de control of hyperglycemia and its 
symptoms, prevention and treatment of diabetic complications, a nd maintenance or 
improvement of general health status. Studies in hospitalized p atients with diabetes have 
shown that improvement in glucose control can reduce complicati ons and are cost savings7,18,32; 
however, no prospective studies have determined the impact of i mproving glucose control on 
clinical outcome in subacute and  long-term skilled nursing care  facilities (LTC). The 
management of diabetes in LTC residents is similar to that reco mmended for ambulatory 
patients with diabetes33,34; however, several factors complicate the management of 
hyperglycemia in this population8. LTC residents tend to be older and to have higher rates of 
comorbidities associated with ag ing such as functional disabili ty, hypertension, coronary artery 
disease, cerebrovascular events,  depression, cognitive impairme nt, urinary incontinence, and 
higher risk of falls.   In addition,  they often experience changes in nutritional intake, which 
increase the risk of hypoglycemia5-8. 
Current guidelines and position statements on diabetes manageme nt in older adults 35-38are 
based on consensus opinions or from extrapolations from studies  involving middle-aged 
patients with diabetes. The American Diabetes Association guide lines recommend that older 
adults who are functional, cognit ively intact, and have longer life expectancy should receive 
diabetes care with goals similar to those   developed for young er adults 36. In these subjects, a 
Protocol Title :  The CGM-GTS in Long-term care   
 
Page 5 of 27  Protocol Version : Version 2, March 22, 2021 
IRB Form BIO 08102020 
HbA1c level <7.5%, a fasting glucose between 90-130 mg/dl, and a random glucose <180 mg/dl 
is recommended. Less intensive goals are recommended for patien ts with advanced 
complications, life-limiting como rbid illness, or cognitive imp airment. Other organizations 
including the American Geriatric Society, European Diabetes Wor king Party for Older People 
guidelines, International Association of Gerontology and Geriat rics, the European Diabetes 
Working Party for Older People recommend a target HbA1c of <7.5 % for patients without major 
comorbidities while a higher target of 7.6-8.5% is proposed for  frail patients with high risk of 
hypoglycemia35,39-44. These guidelines highlight the  importance of improved glucose  control and 
avoidance of side effects and hy poglycemia, as they are associa ted with increased risk of 
complications and mortality in patients with diabetes40-44.  
Diabetes drug utilization in subacute and long-term skilled nur sing care facilities (LTC).  There 
are twelve antidiabetic drugs with different mechanisms of acti on to treat patients with T2D45. 
Metformin is recommended as first choice OAD agent for the mana gement of patients with 
T2D36,46; however, it may cause anorexia , nausea, diarrhea, weight loss , and lactic acidosis in 
patients with impaired renal function47,48.  Insulin secretagogues are effective in reducing 
glucose levels, but are associat ed with high risk of hypoglycem ia49. Thiazolidinediones improve 
insulin sensitivity but frequently cause weight gain, edema, os teopenia and are contraindicated 
in subjects with heart failure49,50͘dŚĞɲ -glucosidase inhibitors delay carbohydrates absorption, 
but are associated with a high rate of GI side effects48. DPP4-inhibitors are promising agents in 
the elderly because they stimulate insulin secretion in a gluco se-dependent fashion, thus not 
causing hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy or in combination  with metformin therapy51-
53.  
Insulin therapy is widely recommended for diabetes management i n LTC residents 54,55.  Recent 
reports indicate that prescribing pattern in patients with diab etes in LTC facilities is shifting 
towards insulin, accounting for nearly 68% of new drug starts 56. Clinical guidelines recommend 
initiating insulin when oral age nts fail or are contraindicated , and when random BG levels are 
>180 mg/dL54,55. These guidelines favor the use  of basal bolus insulin regimen s over sliding scale 
regular insulin57-59. The basal bolus insulin has bee n shown to improve glycemic co ntrol 60-62 and 
to reduce hospital complications in patients with T2D62; however, insulin administration 
approach is associated with high risk of hyp oglycemia (see preliminary resu lts). 
Glucose monitoring in subacute and long-term care settings: Cap illary point of care (POC) and 
CGM glucose testing.  Bedside capillary POC glucose mon itoring is the standard of car e to 
assess glycemic control in the hospital and in LTC facilities 17-19. POC testing is usually performed 
before meals and at bedtime. CGM measures interstitial glucose every 5-15 minutes, thus 
provides a more complete glycemic profile during 24-hours than POC testing. Several 
randomized trials have shown th at CGM systems facilitate and im prove diabetes care in insulin-
treated ambulatory patients 63-65, as well as in hospitalized patients 21,23,66-69.  In a recent study 
of hospitalized patients with T2D, we reported increased detect ion of both hypo- and hyper- 
glycemic events with the use of CGM compared to the standard-of -care POC BG testing 21. 
More than 50% of the hypoglycemic events occurred between dinne r and breakfast; suggesting 
that these episodes would be missed by standard POC testing. In  addition, a prospective 
Protocol Title :  The CGM-GTS in Long-term care   
 
Page 6 of 27  Protocol Version : Version 2, March 22, 2021 
IRB Form BIO 08102020 
hospital study in insulin treated patients with T2D by our grou p reported that 45% of 
hypoglycemic events were asymptomatic 70.  In multivariate analysis, male gender (OR 2.08, 
95% CI 1.13 to 3.83, p=0.02) and age >65 years (OR 4.01, 95% CI  1.62 to 9.92, p=0.02) were 
independent predictors of asymptomatic hypoglycemia. A recent p anel of experts in inpatient 
diabetes care reported that CGM could more effectively identify  trends toward hypoglycemia 
and hyperglycemia, allowing for better and safer management of patients with inpatient 
hyperglycemia 71,72.   
Recent reports indicate that CGM data can be transmitted to the  nursing station by way of 
automatic downloading into a monitor at the nursing station. A recently published study 
evaluated whether the Dexcom CGM using a “Glucose Telemetry Sys tem” can decrease 
hypoglycemia in the general wards/non-ICU setting92. The study included insulin treated 
patients with T2D at high risk for hypoglycemia. Participants w ere randomized to either the 
“Glucose Telemetry System” (intervention group) or to POC BG te sting (control group). For 
patients in the “Glucose Telemetry System” nurses were instruct ed to proceed with 
hypoglycemia prevention actions if the low glucose alerts were activated (set at <85 mg/dl). 
Participants in the control grou p were placed on “blinded” CGM systems which were only used 
to collect glucometrics data. Ov erall, the subjects in the CGM- GTS experienced fewer events of 
hypoglycemia (<70 mg/d L), clinically signifi cant hypoglycemia ( <54 mg/dL) compared to the 
POC BG group. The outcomes of the intervention versus control g roups for these two levels of 
hypoglycemia were, respectively,  0.67 versus 1.69 events/ patie nt, p =0.024 (< 70 mg/dl) and 
0.08 versus 0.75 events/patient, p =0.003 (< 54 mg/dl). In addi tion, there was a reduction in 
percentage of time in hypoglycemic range <70 mg/dl and <54 mg/d l in the GTS compared to 
POC group (0.40%, versus 1.88%, p =0.002 and 0.05%, versus 0.82 %, p =0.017). In the current 
research proposal, we will use th e Dexcom G6 CGM with GTS and a larm set up at 85 mg/dL to 
prevent hypoglycemia.  
Significance and Innovation. 
Significance.  Two previous RCTs in the subacute and LTC facilities comparing oral agents and 
basal insulin reported similar improvement in glycemic control,  but high rates of hypoglycemia 
in patients treated with basal insulin  12,13. The rate of hypoglycemia in insulin and sulfonylureas 
treated patients was 30-40%.  Patients with hypoglycemia requir ed greater resource utilization 
and higher emergency room and hospital transfers compared to re sidents without 
hypoglycemia 44. The high rate of insulin-associated hypoglycemia is worrisome , as recent 
population studies have suggested that diabetes prescribing in LTC is shifting towards insulin, 
accounting for ~half of patients with T2D 44 and nearly 68% of new drug starts 56.  Capillary POC 
glucose testing is the standard of care for glucose monitoring in the hospital and LTC facilities.  
Our group and others have shown that POC misses about 40% of hy poglycemia cases, 
particularly at night (REF). Increased detection of both hypo- and hyper- glycemic events have 
reported with the use of CGM compare to the POC BG 21. In addition, we recently reported that 
CGM-GTS with alarm can successfully reduce the frequency and ti me in hypoglycemia 
compared in insulin treated patients with T2D compared to POC ( REF).  We anticipate that by 
Reducing hypoglycemia in subacute and long-term skilled nursing  care facilities may reduce the 
rate of complications, ER visits and need for hospital readmiss ions.

Innovation.  We propose the first RCT to assess the impact of glucose contro l and hypoglycemia 
reduction with the use of real time CGM with an alarm system to  prevent hypoglycemia and 
facilitate the care of insulin and  non-insulin treated patients  with T2D in subacute and long-
term skilled nursing care facilit ies. The results  of this study  have great potential to impact and 
facilitate care and to change c urrent clinical guidelines in th e management of older adults with 
diabetes in subacute and LTC facilities. 
 PRELIMINARY RESULTS: 
Diabetes and Clinical Outcome in LTC Residents  
44.  In a retrospective study, we analyzed the 
quality of diabetes care, glycemi c control, and clinical outcom e in 1,409 subjects admitted to 3 
community LTC facilities in Atlan ta. The prevalence of diabetes  was 34.2%. On admission, 
patients with diabetes were sliding scale regular insulin (25%) , OADs (5%), insulin (34%), or with 
combination of OADs and insulin ( 26%). Patients with diabetes h ad higher number of 
complications and required more emergency room and hospital tra nsfers. A total of 42% of

reported in 45% on OADs (mostly sulfonylurea plus SSI), or insu lin therapy. Patients with 
hypoglycemia had a longer length of stay, higher emergency room  or 
hospital transfers (44% vs. 30%; p=0.004) and higher mortality (18% 
vs. 10%, p=0.015).  These results indicate that diabetes is com mon in 
LTC and is associated with higher resource utilization and complications, and that hypoglyce mia is associated with increas ed 
rates of emergency room care and hospitalization, length of sta y, and 
mortality
44.  
Comparing of Oral Antidiabetic Agents and Basal Insulin in LTC 
Residents with T2D 12. In a prospective study we recruited 150 
patients from 2 university-affiliated facilities with BG > 180 mg/dl or 
A1C >7.5%, treated with diet and/or with stable dose of OADs or  
glargine (starting at 0.1 U/kg/day), were randomized to continu e OAD 
plus sliding scale insulin or to basal insulin glargine startin g at 0.1 
U/kg/day plus SSI for up to 6 months (Fig 1). There were no differences in daily glucose or with the A1C at 3 months or at 6 
months or in the number of patients with hypoglycemia (basal 28 % 
vs. control 31%, p=0.37). The re sults of this study indicated s imilar 
improvement in glycemic control,  without differences in mean da ily BG, hypoglycemia with 
basal insulin or with OADs and SSI supplements. It was also evi dent that 1/3 od treated with 
OADs and insulin experienced hypoglycemia indicating the need f or safer regimens.

DPP4-inhibitors vs Basal insulin in LTC (Linagliptin-LTC Trial)13.  A 6-
month open-label pilot randomized  controlled trial compared the 
efficacy and safety of a DPP4-i ( linagliptin) and basal insulin  in 
subacute and LTC residents with T2D admitted to 3 institutions affiliated with Emory University. A total of 140 residents with  T2D 
treated with oral antidiabetic a gents or low-dose insulin (0.1 U/kg/d), 
with fasting BG>180 mg/dL and/or HbA1c >7.5% were randomized to  
linagliptin 5 mg day or glargine at a starting dose of 0.1 U/kg /d. 
Baseline antidiabetic therapy, except metformin, was discontinu ed on 
trial entry. BG was measured before meals and both groups recei ved 
supplemental rapid-acting insulin before meals for BG > 200 mg/ dL. 
As shown in Figure 4, treatment with linagliptin resulted in no  
significant differences in mean daily BG, but resulted in fewer  mild 
hypoglycemic events <70 mg/dL (3% vs. 37%, P <0.001), and a non -
significant trend towards lower risk of BG <54 mg/dL (0% vs 7%,  
p=0.06). There were no significant between-group differences in  
length of stay, complications, em ergency department visits, or 
hospitalizations. These results suggested that DPP4-inhibiors a re 
effective and represent an alternative to insulin therapy in ma ny LTC 
residents with T2D. 
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in the hospital setting.  Our 
research team have reported on 3 RCTs comparing the accuracy of  
using of CGM and capillary point of care (POC) glucose testing in 
insulin treated patients with T2D 
21,24,73,74.  Increased detection of 
both hypo- and hyper-glycemic events with the use of CGM compar ed 
to POC testing was found. More than 50% of the hypoglycemic occ urred 
at night; suggesting that many of these episodes would be misse d by 
standard POC testing.  In a recent study 24, we compared the 
performance of the FreeStyle Libre Pro CGM and POC glucose test ing 
among insulin-treated hospitalized patients with T2D. The mean daily 
glucose was higher by POC testing, and proportions of patients with BG 
<70 mg/dl and <54 mg/dl by POC BG were lower compared to CGM, a ll 
p<0.001 (Fig 3).  The overall me an absolute relative difference  (MARD), 
the statistical measure of accuracy used as the standard in glu cose 
monitoring to represent performance, was 14.8%, ranging between 11.4 to 16.7% for glucoses 
between 70 and 250 mg/dl and the Error Grid analysis showed 98. 0% of glucose pairs within 
Zones A and B.   
In Figure 4, we present the accuracy of the Dexcom G6 CGM compa red to POC testing in 218 
consecutive insulin-treated general medicine (n= 192) and surge ry (n= 26) patients with T1D (n= 
9) and T2D (n=209). The mean age was 61 r12 years, HbA1c 9.07 r2.2%, admission BG 224 r2 
mg/dl, with 47% of patients with eGFR < 60 ml/min, length of st ay, median 5.0 (4.0, 10.0) days.  
The Overall mean absolute relati ve difference (MARD) was 12.692  and median ARD of 10.048

during the hospital stay and with 98.6% of matched pair reading s within Error Grid within Zones 
A and B (Figure 4).   
Real Time CGM with Glucose 
telemetry System.  We have 
conducted several clinical studies 
with GTS to transmit CGM data to 
the nursing station. A recently 
published study evaluated whether 
the Dexcom CGM using a “Glucose 
Telemetry System” can decrease 
hypoglycemia in the general 
wards/non-ICU setting92. This 
report is the first interventional RCT study of CGM to improve outcomes in the non-ICU setting. 
The study included patients with T2DM, who were at high risk fo r hypoglycemia. Participants 
were randomized to either the “Glucose Telemetry System” (inter vention group) or to POC BG 
testing (control group). For patients in the “Glucose Telemetry  System” nurses were instructed 
to proceed with hypoglycemia prevention actions if the low gluc ose alerts were activated (set 
at <85 mg/dl). Participants in the control group were placed on  “blinded” CGM systems which 
were only used to collect glucometrics data. Overall, the subje cts in the CGM-GTS experienced 
fewer events of hypoglycemia (<7 0 mg/dL), clinically significan t hypoglycemia (<54 mg/dL) 
compared to the POC BG group. The outcomes of the intervention versus control groups for 
these two levels of hypoglycemia were, respectively, 0.67 versu s 1.69 events/ patient, p =0.024 
(< 70 mg/dl) and 0.08 versus 0.75 events/patient, p =0.003 (< 5 4 mg/dl). In addition, there was 
a reduction in percentage of time in hypoglycemic range <70 mg/ dl and <54 mg/dl in the 
glucose telemetry system group compared to POC group (0.40%, ve rsus 1.88%, p =0.002 and 
0.05%, versus 0.82%, p =0.017).  
Summary of Preliminary Data:   The result of studies demonstrates that hypoglycemia is 
common in insulin and non-insulin treated patients admitted to subacute and LTC facilities. 
Most of these episodes are missed when using capillary POC test ing, with CGM providing a 
more complete assessment of glyce mic status, detecting episodes  of diurnal and nocturnal 
hypoglycemia compared to POC testing. The accuracy of Dexcom G6  is excellent and used 
together with GTS, reduces the frequency and time in hypoglycem ia. The proposed RCT have 
great potential to impact and facilitate care of patients with diabetes in subacute and long-term 
LTC facilities, and might change current clinical guidelines in  the management of patients with 
diabetes in subacute and long-term skilled nursing care facilit ies.

4.Study Endpoints 
Diabetes is highly prevalent among adults admitted to subacute and long-term skilled nursing 
care facilities (LTC) 1-4. Managem ent of diabetes in these LTC facilities is challenging due to 
number of older adults with high prevalence of comorbidities, f unctional disability and altered 
nutritional intake, which increase the risk of hypoglycemia5-8.    
Clinical guidelines from professi onal organizations 9-11 recomm end the use of subcutaneous 
insulin, as the preferred therapy for glycemic control for most  patients with type 2 diabetes 
(T2D) in LTC facilities. Although effective in improving glycem ic control, observational and 
prospective randomized studies have reported rates of hypoglyce mia between 30-37% with 
insulin administration in LTC res idents with T2D 12,13.  The hi gh frequency of hypoglycemia is 
of great concern, as it has been associated with cardiac compli cations, emergency room visits, 
hospital admissions and mortality 14-16.   
Bedside capillary point-of-care ( POC) glucose monitoring is the  standard of care to assess 
glycemic control in the in LTC facilities 17-19. POC testing is  recommend by national guidelines 
before meals and at bedtime. This approach provides limited eva luation of glycemic excursions 
and to miss nocturnal hypoglycemia 20-23. Continuous glucose mo nitoring (CGM) measures 
interstitial glucose every 5-15 minutes, thus providing a more comprehensive 24-hours 
glycemic profile assessment than POC testing.  
Recent studies from our group and others in hospitalized patien ts with T2D have reported 
increased detection of both hypo- and hyperglycemic events with  the use of CGM compared to 
POC BG testing 21,23-25.  We also  reported that the hospital us e of the Glucose Telemetry 
System with Bluetooth technology allows CGM glucose values to b e transmitted from the 
patient’s bedside to a central monitoring device in the nursing  station, reducing the frequency 
of hypoglycemia in insulin treated patients with T2D 26,27.  Mo re recently, in collaboration 
with the University of Maryland, reported significant reduction  in the rate of hospital 
hypoglycemia in insulin treated medicine and surgery patients w ith T2D using the glucose 
telemetry system with real-time CGM 28.  In addition, the use o f Dexcom G6 CGM in insulin-
treated patients revealed great accuracy, with 98.6% of reading  within Clarke error Grid A and B 
(unpublished data, see preliminary results section).  Thus, our  experience in the hospital 
supports the use of the use of CGM for the management of patien ts with diabetes and 
prevention of hypoglycemia.  However, we do not know if this ex perience can be extrapolated 
to individuals in long-term skille d nursing facilities.  Theref ore, in-depth analyses of glycemic 
control and potential benefit of RT-CGM in real-world is needed  to determine whether the 
CGM-GTS can improve glycemic con trol and prevent hypoglycemia i n vulnerable population of 
adult patients admitte d to LTC facilities.   
The primary aim is difference between POC testing and CGM-GTS i n the frequency of 
hypoglycemia (safety outcome) and glycemic control (efficacy ou tcome) during admission.  
1) Hypoglycemia <70 mg/dl and c linically significant hypoglycem ia <54 mg/dl (safety 
outcome) 
2) Glycemic control, as measured by time in range (TIR) between  80-180 mg/dl (efficacy 
outcome)

Secondary outcomes  include differences between groups in any of the following mea sures:  
1.Nocturnal hypoglycemia < 70 mg/dl and < 54 mg/dl (between 22:00  and 06:00)  
2.Number of hypoglycemia events (< 70 and 54 mg/dl)  
3.Time in hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dl) and hyperglycemia (>240 mg/dl)  
4.Number of prolonged hypoglycemia > 1 and 2 hours by CGM 
5.Frequency and time of hypoglycemic during the day and night  
6.Frequency and duration or time on hyperglycemia > 240 mg/dl  
7.Percentage of BG readings within target BG of 70 and 180 mg/dl  
8.Glycemic variability calculated b y standard deviation and MAGE 
9.Number of sensor removal for procedures/imaging, sensors failur es, sensors

 5.Study Intervention/Investigational Agent 
We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determin e whether compared 
to standard of care using capilla ry POC testing, the use of Dex com CGM with Glucose 
Telemetry System (CGM-GTS) with hypoglycemia alarm will facilit ate diabetes treatment 
and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in insulin and non-insulin treated patients with T2D 
in LTC facilities.  
Dexcom CGM- Glucose 
Telemetry System CGM-GTS).  The system will include 3 main 
devices, i) DEXCOM G6 CGM 
device (sensor, transmitter, ii) a smart phone, and iii) a tablet computer located at the nursing station. As a first step glucose values obtained from the CGM sensor will be sent to the CGM transmitter by Bluetooth technology and DEXCOM Share2 software application to a smart phone that serves 
as an intermediate-transmitting (routing) device. The study pho ne will be locked in a safe box 
located in the patient’s room. With the help of commercial inte rnet wireless network, glucose 
values from the smart phone will be transmitted wirelessly to a  table computer (I-Pad) using 
the DEXCOM Follow application [https://www.dexcom.com/apps].

6.Procedures Involved 
Residents with T2D in subacute and long-term skilled nursing ca re facilities treated with insulin 
and/or insulin-secretagogues  will be randomized to a standard of care group with POC testing  
or to real time Dexcom CGM with GTS for up to 60 days of admiss ion. 
Patients in the standard of care group will wear a blinded CGM and receive POC testing before meals and bedtime, with providers adjusting oral agents or insulin dose based on POC results. Patients in the 
intervention CGM group w ill have a single daily 
fasting POC testing and will wear a real-time Dexcom G6 with GTS, and providers will adjust oral or insulin therapy based on CGM-GTS profile information. 
Nursing staff and primary ca re will receive education 
on the CGM technology by our research team. Education efforts will include general information on the technology, how and when to remove or replace 
CGM sensors and transmitters, and the hypoglycemia 
prevention protocol. Treatment of hypoglycemia (POC <70 mg/dl) will be similar in both groups following a standard hospital protocol.  
CGM alarm settings, and prevention of hypoglycemia protocol. Hy poglycemia alarm will be set 
to < 85 mg/dl (for prevention for low blood glucose levels). Nu rsing staff will be instructed to 
provide 15 grams of carbohydrates in response to a hypoglycemia  alarm.  For control group 
(blinded CGM) CGM alarms are turned off, however if the POC is found to be between <80 
mg/dl by POC, 15 grams of carbohydrates will be given as a prev entive measurement for 
hypoglycemia (standard of care). 
The hyperglycemia alarm will be set at 300 mg/dl. If this occur s, the nursing staff will assess 
clinical status and perform a POC glucose testing to confirm gl ucose values.  If BG > 300 mg/dl, 
nursing staff will communicate the high glucose value to the pr imary care team. 
Diabetes Management Protocol
We will recruit and randomize males and females with a known hi story of T2D treated with oral 
antidiabetic agents, short- and long-acting GLP1-RA or insulin therapy. Glycemic target during 
admission is to maintain BG between 80-180 during the day, whil e avoiding hypoglycemia < 70 
mg/dl.  
Patients treated with oral antidiabetic agents.  Dose of antidiabetic agents will be continued 
after randomization unless there is contraindication (i.e., eGF R < 30 mil/ml for patients on 
metformin and SGLT2; pioglitazone and heart failure, history of  pancreatitis for DPP4-I or GLP1-
RA), or sulfonylurea (eGFR < 30 ml/min or history of severe hyp oglycemia).  patients will receive

supplemental/correction insulin for BG >200 mg/dL per sliding-s cale. The attending physician 
could adjust oral medications at his/her discretion in the pres ence of severe glycemic 
excursions.  
Recommended Insulin staring dose for insulin naïve patients.  If primary care opts to start 
insulin therapy, the recommended dose of basal insulin is 0.1 u nit/kg, given at the same time 
every day.  Dose of oral agents may be continued, but sulfonylu rea agents should be reduced 
by half or stopped to prevent hypoglycemia. 
Patients T2D Treated with Insulin . Subjects treated with insulin will continue to receive their 
total daily dose (TDD) and insulin formulation after randomizat ion. Glycemic target during 
admission is to maintain BG between 80-180 during the day, whil e avoiding hypoglycemia < 70 
mg/dl. 
The attending physician could adjust total daily insulin dose f ollowing the suggested insulin 
adjustment protocol: 

Basal Insulin adjustment.   
xDaily basal (glargine, detemir or  degludec) insulin dose will b e adjusted as follow:  
If the fasting and pre-dinner BG is between 100 - 180 mg/dl in the absence of hypoglycemia 
the previous day: no change  
If the fasting and pre-dinner BG is between 181 - 250 mg/dl in the absence of hypoglycemia: 
increase basal insulin by 10% every day  
If the fasting and pre-dinner BG is between 251 - 350 mg/dl in the absence of hypoglycemia: 
increase basal insulin by 20% every day  
If the fasting and pre-dinner BG is > 350 mg/dl in the absence of hypoglycemia the previous 
day: increase basal insulin (gla rgine) dose by 30% every day  
If the fasting and pre-dinner BG is between 70 - 99 mg/dl in th e absence of hypoglycemia: 
decrease TDD (basal and prandial) insulin dose by 10% every day   
If BG <70 mg/dL, the insulin TDD (basal and prandial) should be  decreased by 30%.   
If BG <40 mg/dL, the insulin TDD (basal and prandial) should be  decreased by 40-50%.   
  Supplemental insulin.  Rapid-acting insulin will be administered following the 
“supplemental/correction insulin scale” protocol followed by th e facility.    
xIf a patient is able and expected to eat most of his/her meals,  supplemental insulin will be 
administered before meals and at bedtime following the “usual” dose of the insulin scale 
protocol. 
xIf a patient is not able to eat, supplemental insulin will be a dministered every 6 hours 
following the “sensitive” dose of  the supplemental insulin scal e protocol.\

3.Female subjects who are pregnant or breast -feeding at time of enrollment into the study. 
 
Inclusion of children : No patients under the age of 18 will be recruited in this stu dy. 
 
11.Vulnerable Populations: 
Prisoners, pregnant women, neonates will not be included in the  study. Nursing home residents 
with diabetes have higher rates of serious comorbidities and ha ve greater activity of daily living 
dependencies than other residents without diabetes.  The present study aims to determine if 
CGM -GTS will benefit  the management and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia of LTC patie nts with 
T2DM . Research staff will ask the primary care team about the reside nt’s cognitive status and ask 
if they are able to consent. If the primary team deems the pati ent is not able to give informed 
consent then we will approach the legal representative  (durable power of attorney for health 
care, court appointed guardian for health care decisions, spous e, or adult child ).  
 12.Local Number of Participants 
The total number of participants to be accrued locally is 100.  13.Recruitment Methods 
Coordinators will screen for potential participants from the el ectronic medical record. 
Once a potential research candidate is identified, the investig ators and/or research 
coordinators will discuss the research protocol with the provid er (doctor, nurse, or 
house staff) taking care of the SAR/LTC resident and request pe rmission to include 
him/her in the trial. If the pri mary provider agrees to include  the resident in the trial, 
then he/she will be invited to participate in the study. Subjec ts will be approached by 
phone or in their facility room to find out their interested. I f the potential candidate is 
interested, they will be provided with sufficient information o n the practice of glucose 
monitoring before providing written consent.  If the primary te am deems the resident is 
not able to give informed consent then we will approach the leg al representative 
(durable power of attorney for health care, court appointed gua rdian for health care 
decisions, spouse, or adult child) by phone. In this case, a ve rbal consent will be 
obtained, and a full copy of the consent will be provided by em ail or regular mail. The 
process of obtaining informed consent will follow the standard procedures of Emory 
University. This protocol will be  submitted for approval by the  Emory IRB. 
Participation in this study is vo luntary. Participants will rec eive one hundred dollars 
($100.00) during the LTC stay. Total compensation will be one h undred dollars ($100).

14.Withdrawal of Participants 
Participants may withdraw from th e study if they decided to. Th ey also will have the right to 
request that any data was collected to be removed by contacting   members of the research 
team.   15.Risks to Participants 
Potential Risk to Human Subjects
Hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia in pati ents treated with insulin regim ens is between 
12%–35% 61,62,79,80. In this study, hypoglycemia is defined as a BG or IG < 70 mg/ dL. Clinical 
significant hypoglycemia is defined as BG or IG < 54 mg/dl. Sev ere hypoglycemia is defined as 
BG < 40 mg/dL.  
Use of CGM.  No major risks are expected with the use of the CGM device. Pa in and bleeding 
with insertion is minimal. Skin irritation may occur in those s ensitive to adhesives.  
Protection against Risks 
We will follow safeguards to minimize the risk to our subjects:  a) we will carefully monitor 
capillary BG at the bedside using a hand-held glucose meter, b)  only experienced nurses/or 
phlebotomist will draw blood samples.  To prevent significant c linical events, no patients with 
history of significant liver, renal impairment or cardiac failu re will be recruited in this study.   
We expect that approximately 20-30% in insulin and sulfonylurea  treated patients will 
experience one or more episodes of hypoglycemia.  To minimize t he risk of hypoglycemia, the 
starting dose will be adjusted following a protocol that has be en shown effective on insulin 
adjustment.  To avoid hypoglycemia, the total daily dose of ins ulin will be decreased by 10% for 
BG between 70-99 mg/dl and by 20% after each episode of hypogly cemia (BG < 70 mg/dl).  
CGM – alarms and hypoglycemia protocol.  We will use a Dexcom CGM d evice with a modified 
transmitter able to store and transmit glucose data to differen t devices including a 
notebook/IPAD or computer desk located at the nursing station. The use of hypoglycemia alarm 
set at 85 mg/dl will alert nursing staff and providers that a p atient maybe at risk of 
hypoglycemia.  If this occurs, th e nursing staff will meet pati ent in the room to assess clinical 
status and signs/symptoms of hyp oglycemia and will perform a PO C glucose testing to confirm 
glucose values.  In addition, a carbohydrate load of 15 grams w ill be provided to patients as per 
hospital protocol to avoid hypoglycemia. 
Hyperglycemia alarm  will be set at 300 mg/dl to alert the nursing staff and provid ers of the risk 
of clinically significant hypergl ycemic complicat ion.  If this occurs, the nursing staff will meet 
patient in the room to assess clinical status and will perform a POC glucose testing to confirm 
glucose values.  If BG > 300 mg /dl, nursing staff will communic ate this high glucose value to the 
primary care team. The primary care team will review patient re cord and insulin administration 
prior to determining need for additional corrective rapid-actin g insulin. If patient has received 
corrective insulin within the past 2 hours, additional correcti on will not be given, and the blood

IRB Form BIO 08102020 
sugar will be re-checked in 1 hour.  If the glucose value conti nues to rise with a rise indicated by 
CGM trend arrow, then additional corrective insulin will be giv en at that time. 
Hypoglycemia management:  If the patient is awake, 25 ml (1/2 a mp) will be given IV or oral 
juice/snack (crackers) as per protocol.  If the patient is not awake:  50ml (1 amp) will be given 
STAT.  Blood glucose levels will be repeated in 15 minutes and dextrose administration will be 
repeated as needed for values < 70 mg/dl.   
Insertion of the CGM sensor will be performed per manufacturer instructions, and 
following an aseptic technique. After insertion of the sensors,  providers will ensure 
proper hemostasis is achieved. Sensors will be removed if prolo nged bleeding or severe 
pain occurs. 
16.Potential Benefits to Participants 
Subject participating in the sta ndard group will not receive an y direct benefits during the LTC 
stay, since treatment decision will be made based on POC BG (st andard of care).  Patients in the 
intervention group of CGM-GTS will also have a POC in the morni ng, but will benefit of 24/7 
glucose monitoring to assess glycemic control.  In addition, CG M with alarm may reduce the risk 
of hypoglycemia. 
 
17.Compensation to Participants 
Participants will receive one h undred dollars ($100.00) during the LTC stay. Total compensation 
will be one hundred dollars ($100). Compensation will be provid ed via ClinCard. 
18.Data Management and Confidentiality 
In order to assure each subject’ s confidentiality, data collect ed under this protocol will be 
coded and stored in a secure locked file cabinet with access lim ited to those directly related to 
the conduct of this study. Electronic versions of these data wi ll be stored on a limited access,

Data management and statistical analysis: 
The present aims of this RCT is to investigate whether the Dexc om G6 CGM with Glucose 
Telemetry System (CGM-GTS) with hypoglycemia alarm may reduce t he risk of hypoglycemia < 
70 mg/dl (safety outcome) and improve glycemic control as measu red by the percent of time in 
range (TIR) 70-180 mg/dl (efficacy end-point) in patients with T2D in subacute and long-term 
skilled nursing care facilities. P atients in the standard of ca re group will wear a blinded CGM 
and receive POC testing before meals and bedtime, with provider s adjusting oral agents or 
insulin dose based on POC results . Patients in the intervention  CGM group will have a single 
daily fasting POC testing and w ill wear a real-time Dexcom G6 w ith GTS, and providers will 
adjust oral or insulin therapy based on CGM-GTS profile informa tion.  Professor Limin Peng, 
PhD at the School of Public Health at Emory University will con duct statistical analyses.   
For the safety endpoint, we will first compare the proportions of patients who have at least one 
episode of hypoglycemia by POC a nd by CGM. We will first perfor m nonparametric 
comparisons of the rate of hypoglycemia based on a two-sided Ch i-square test (or Fisher’s exact 
test in the presence of low inci dence rates), followed by the C ochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, 
which adjusts for the potential center effect. Then we will per form univariate Poisson 
regression (or Negative Binomial regression) to assess whether there is any difference in the 
number of clinically significant hypoglycemia events between th e two treatment groups. We 
will further conduct multivariate Logistic regression, Poisson regression (or Negative Binomial 
regression) to estimate the difference in the rate and frequenc y of hypoglycemia while 
adjusting for potential confounders. A glucose value < 70 mg/dl  is considered as hypoglycemia 
requiring a nurse-driven response; thus, a BG <70 mg/dl will be  used for sample size calculation. 
Data from Singh et al75a reduction of hypoglycemia was reported comparing the CGM/GTS 
system than POC (Sign et al 2020) per patient (0.67 episodes pe r patient, 95% CI 0.34-1.30

versus 1.69 episodes per patient, 95% CI 1.11-2.58, p= 0.024) 28. Based on the results of the 
recent glargine U100 vs U300 study using CGM monitoring in the hospital, 56% had CGM BG 
readings <70 mg/dl (vs 14% with POC testing-standard of care), it is reasonable to assume 60% 
of resident on LTC facilities will experience one or more BG < 70 mg/dl by CGM.   If we assume 
that 35% in the standard of care group will have at least one BG <70  mg/dl (based on linagliptin 
LTC study) 76, using one-sided, two-sample t-tests, we require we will need 70 patients per 
group to achieve 80% power.

 Estimated sample size (N/group) for 80% 
power   49 
   70  107  186  407 
For the efficacy endpoint, we will compare mean daily glucose l evels measured by CGM or POC, 
and percent TIR measured by CGM between treatment groups by non parametric Wilcoxon-
tests or two-sample t-tests, and  by multivariate linear regress ion, which adjusts for other 
potential confounders such as age, gender, BMI, center, and adm ission HbA1c. A logarithm 
transformation may be employed to make the data better conform to the normality 
assumption. When conducting mult ivariate regression analyses, w e will apply standard variable 
selection and model checking procedures to decide the final mod el. Stepwise, backward, or 
forward model selection strategy will be adopted to determine t he variables to be included in 
the final model. Standard diagnostic and model checking procedu res, such as deviance residual 
plot and Hosmer- Lemeshow test, will be applied to examine the fit of the developed models. 
To show non-inferiority between POC and CGM in terms of glycemi c control, we set the 
equivalence margin of 18 mg/dl (1 mosm/l), from a view that a d ifference <18 mg/dl is usually 
not considered as clinically significant 60,61,77. Based on the results from our recent CGM trials 
28,78, it is reasonable to assume the standard deviation of mean dai ly BG is bounded above by 45 
mg/dl. Assuming the true BG difference between the treatment gr oups is zero, and using one-
sided, two-sample t-tests, we require 70 subjects for each trea tment group to achieve 80% 
power.   19.Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Particip ants 
 Baseline and daily information will be entered by the study coo rdinators into data collection 
paper forms and into an electronic database (REDCap) provided b y the Emory Research 
Information Technology Departm ent. Baseline data will include d emographics/history form 
(subject gender, age, ethnicity, type of treatment and comorbid  conditions, body weight, BMI, 
laboratory results).  Daily inf ormation will be collected on tr eatment, nutrition, blood glucose 
and laboratory values, complications and adverse events (hypogl ycemia). The safety of 
interventions and treatments associated with this protocol will  be under continuous review by

the investigative team. All adve rse events will be reviewed bi- weekly in a multidisciplinary 
format that will involve review b y a physician, and other membe rs of the research team. All 
Serious Adverse Events will be r eviewed within the applicable g uidelines and submitted to the 
IRB and other appropriate regula tory bodies governing this stud y. 
In addition, we have implemented protection against risks appro aches as above to minimize the 
risk to our subjects.  Stopping Rules:  We plan to perform interim analysis on the primary endpoint ev ery 6 months 
and/or when half of the subjects have been randomized. The tria l will be stopped if there is 
evidence beyond a reasonable doubt of a difference in the rate of death and hospital 
complications (two-sided alpha level, <0.01) between the treatm ent groups.  
Plans for transmission  of temporary or permanent suspension act ions: 
Any actions that mandate temporary or permanent suspension of s tudy will be transmitted to 
the Emory IRB, and, if appropriate, to the FDA.  The frequency of protocol review will be: every 6 months.    The PI will forward reports of safety reviews within 15 days of  the meeting to the Emory IRB.

explained to the participant by the investigators or research c oordinator. Individuals will be 
asked if they have any questions , and research staff will answe r these questions. The principal 
investigator will also be available to answer questions that pa rticipants may have during the 
consent procedure or during the time a participant is enrolled in the study. The consent form 
will be completed in accordance w ith the IRB guidelines of Emor y University. Residents will be 
informed that participation in the study is voluntary and there  are other forms of treatment 
available to control their blood  glucose levels. They will be g iven time to ask any questions they 
have about the study. They will al so be informed that their car e will not be affected if they 
choose not to participate. Consent process will take place in r esidents’ room. In the event 
where primary care team deems that the resident not able to giv e informed consent, research 
coordinator will approach their LAR by phone.  
A copy of the consent form will be provided to the participant and a copy will be placed in the 
file that is maintained for each participant in the study offic e. A copy of the consent will be sent 
via email or by mail when the LAR has provided verbal consent o r requests a full copy prior to 
providing consent for their relative.  
Adults who speak any of the following languages (English, Russi an, Spanish and Arabic) 
will be approached for participation in the study.   
Cognitively Impaired Adults and Adults Unable to Consent    
Long-term care residents with di abetes have higher rates of ser ious comorbidities and 
have greater activity of daily living dependencies than residen ts without diabetes. The 
present study aims to determine if CGM -GTS will benefit the ma nagement and reduce 
the risk of hypoglycemia in long-term care residents with T2DM.  Research staff will ask 
the primary care team about the resident’s cognitive status and  ask if they are able to 
consent. If the primary team deems the patient is not able to g ive informed consent 
then we will approach the legal r epresentative (durable power o f attorney for health 
care, court appointed guardian for health care decisions, spous e, or adult child). During 
the progress of the study the primary team will be monitoring t he cognitive status of the 
participant. In the instance that the patient has a legal repre sentative, the study 
procedures will be described to th em. The resident’s legal repr esentative will be 
approached by phone to inform the study activities, benefits, a nd risks. They will be 
given time to ask any questions they have about the study and t he opportunity to 
discuss with the potential enrollee as well. The legal guardian  will be informed that the 
study is voluntary and that care of their relative will not be affected if they choose not 
to participate.

23.Setting 
Identification and recruitment of patients will occur in Grady (Crestview Health and 
Rehabilitation Center) and  Emory affiliated subacute rehab and skilled nursing facilities which 
include: Budd Terrace Nursing Home and A.G. Rhodes Wesley Woods . 
 24.Resources Available 
Potential subjects will be identified by their treating physici ans and referred to the 
researchers. Residents' private and identifiable information wi ll not be shared prior to 
receiving permission from the resident to do so. All residents with history of diabetes 
will be considered for participat ion. The research team and/or the research 
coordinators will also review res ident's medical records and la boratory tests to identify 
potential candidates. Once identified, the investigators and/or  research coordinators 
will discuss the protocol with th e attending physician taking c are of the resident and 
request permission to include him/her in the trial. If the prim ary physician agrees to 
include the resident in the trial, then the resident will be in vited to participate in the 
study. Potential candidates will be informed that there are oth er forms for glucose 
monitoring available to manage th eir diabetes. Long-term care r esidents will be 
instructed both verbally and in the written informed consent fo rm that their 
participation in the study is entirely voluntary and that they can withdraw at any time, 
which will in no way compromise or alter the usual care that th ey would otherwise 
receive. They will also be given the phone numbers of the PI, I RB chair and Grady official 
to whom they can address any questions or concerns.

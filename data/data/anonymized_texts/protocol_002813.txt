Page 3of 92Study Methodology
This is an interventional, multi -national, multi -site, randomised, double -blind, parallel -group, active -
controlled, fixed -dose study.
Efficacy of Lu AF35700 w ill be assessed by testing for superiority versus an active co ntrol in patients not 
responding adequately to the active control.
The total study duration per patient from Screening to the end of Follow -Up w ill be approximately 2 5weeks.
The study will consist of 4 Period s:
Screening Period
Patients will enter a Scree ning Period of 21days to assess eligibility.
Period A –Prospective Confirm ation Period (6 weeks)
Patients who meet the pr e-specified selection criteria, including the criteria for treatment resistance, will enter 
a single (patient) -blinded treatment peri od with risperidone or olanzapine to confirm their resistance to 
antipsychotic treatment at Baseline 1. Patients will be initiated on risperidone 2 mg/day and up -titrated to 
6mg/day by the end of the first week, except if they have failed on risperidone ( or 9-OH-risperidone; 
Invega™ ) inthe most recent treatment trial, in which case patients will be initiated on olanzapine at 5 mg/day 
and up -titrated to 15 mg/day by the end of the first week. Current antipsychotic medication w ill be down -
tapered w ithin the first 7 days of this treatment period . Patients will receive either risperidone 6 mg/day or 
olanzapine 15mg/day for the subsequent week and thereafter either risperidone 4 or 6 mg/day or olanzapine 15 
or 20mg/day for the subsequent four weeks, which can b e increased for efficacy or decreased for tolerabilit y at 
1-week intervals, between W eeks 2 and 4, according to the investigator’s clinical judgement. Patients will be 
treated w ith at least 6 mg/day of risperidone (or w ith 4 mg / day in case the dose of 6 mg was not tolerated and 
had to be reduced) or with at least 15 mg/day of olanzapine for the last 2 weeks. Patients currently treated with 
‘depot’ antipsychotic medications can, after signing the ICF, be down -tapered by skipping one full treatment 
cycle pl us 3 days before Baseline 1. Patients who do not fulfil the inclusion criteria for Period B will be 
withdrawn from the study. If the patient is withdrawn during Period A, the investigator w ill have the option to 
continue the patient on the treatment assign ed during Period A, as prescribed by the investigator, or 
discontinue IMP.
Period B –Double -blind Treatm ent Period (10 weeks)
Patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria for lack of clinically relevant improvement during Period A will be 
considered treatmen t-resistant and enter the double -blind treatment period (Period B) at Baseline 2. The 
specific inclusion criteria for Period B will be blinded to the investigators. Patients will be randomly assigned 
(1:1:1) to 10 w eeks of double -blind treatment with eithe r Lu AF35700 10 mg/day, Lu AF35700 20 mg/day or 
to continue the treatment allocated in Period A at the dose set at last visit of Period A (W eek 4).  The 
randomisation will be stratified by country and Period A therapy (risperidone or olanzapine). No dose 
adjustments will be allow ed during Period B. For patients randomised to Lu AF35700, discontinuation of 
risperidone or olanzapine w ill be done gradually in a blinded fashion during the initial 7 days of the double -
blind treatment period (Period B).    
Safet y Follow -Up Period (6 weeks)
All patients (except patients, who c ontinue in the extension study) , including patients with a clinically releva nt 
improvement, patients who have completed the treatment period and those who withdraw will be sche duled 
for a Saf ety Follow -up Visit at the clinic for safety assessments 6 weeks after the last dose of IMP.
Patients withdrawn during Period B (except those withdraw ing due to withdrawal of consent ) will be asked to 
attend an Efficacy Follow -up Visit at the date of their last scheduled visit of Period B (study Week 16) for the 
assessment of efficacy, safety and concomitant medication. The study design is presented in Panel 1and the 
scheduled assessments are summarised in Panel 2.
The randomisation rate will be monitored during the study.

Page 8of 92Statistical Methodology
The follow ing analysis sets will be used to analyse and present the data:
all-patients -treated set Period A (APTS_A) –all patients who took at least one dose of study medication 
during Period A (risperidone or olanzapine)
all-patients -treated set (APTS) –all randomised patients who took at least one dose of double -blind study 
medication (Lu AF35700, risperidone or olanzapine) after randomisation (Period B)
full-analysis set (FAS) –all patients i n the APTS w ho had a valid Baseline 2 assessment and at least one valid 
post-baseline 2 assessment of PANSS total score
The efficacy analyses will be based on the FAS. A significance level of 0.05 is used unless otherwise 
indicated. For all endpoints, the effects of the two doses of Lu AF35700 will be evaluated by testing the null 
hypothesis of no difference to the active control for each dose. Hochberg’s procedure will be used to control 
for multiplicity. 
Primary endpoint:
Changes from Baseline 2 (Week 6 ) in total PANSS score at Weeks 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 w ill be analysed 
using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) -based mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
approach. All patients in the FAS will be included w ith their observed data in Period B. D ata retrieved at 
Week 16 from withdrawals will not be included in the primary analysis.  The model will include the fixed, 
categorical effects of treatment (tw o doses of Lu AF35700 and active control), country, visit, treatment -by-
visit interaction, Period -A-therapy (risperidone/olanzapine), Period -A-therapy -by-visit interaction as well as 
the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline score and baseline score -by-visit interaction.  An unstructured 
(co)variance structure will be used to model the within -patie nt errors.  If, unexpectedly, this analysis fails to 
converge, the following structures will be applied, in the follow ing order; first -order ante -dependence, 
heterogeneous compound symmetry, compound symmetry. The Kenw ard-Roger approximation will be used 
to estimate denominator degrees of freedom. The primary comparisons will be the contrasts betw een each 
dose and control at Week 16 based on the least squares means for the treatment -by-visit interaction effect. The 
estimated mean difference between each dos e and the active control based on this model will be reported with 
two-sided symmetric 95% confidence intervals and corresponding p -values.
Secondary endpoints:
For CGI-S and PSP, the same methodology as that described for the primary endpoint will be used. 
The proportion of patients responding at Week 16 will be compared for each dose versus control using logistic 
regression with period A therapy, country and treatment as factors. The analysis will be done for observed 
cases without imputation as well as for the whole FAS, imputing non -response for all patients withdrawn prior 
to Week 16. 
Additional responder analyses using alternative cut points of the primary endpoint may be used to present the 
efficacy as measured by changes from Baseline 2 in total P ANSS score.
Exploratory endpoints:
For NSA- 4, SWN -S, MSQ, TOOL, QLS ,and WoRQ the same methodology as that described for the primary 
endpoint will be used to analyse changes from Baseline 2 of total scores at Weeks 10 and 16. 
Sensitivity analyses for th e primary endpoint:
MMRM model as the primary analysis, including the retrieved data for w ithdrawals.
Pattern -mixture models. Different delta (imputation of how much worse response those who withdraw would 
have compared to those who do complete the treatme nt period and who have the same profile up to time t o 
withdrawal) will be applied.

Page 9of 92Analyses of safety endpoints:
The safety analyses will be based on the APTS.
Adverse events, clinical safety laboratory tests, vital signs, weight/BMI, ECG parameters, and C-SSRS scores 
will be summarised using descriptive statistics. The changes from Baseline 2 in mSAS , AIMS and BARS 
scores at W eeks 10 and 16 will be analysed using an MMRM model as described for the primary endpoint.
Patient disposition and demographics wil l be summarised using descriptive statistics.
Plasma concentrations of Lu AF35700 and metabolite and CYP genotype will be summarised using 
descriptive statistics and may be used in population pharmacokinetic analyses (reported separately).
Sample Size Considerations
A total of n=180 patients per group is needed in Period B to have 90% pow er for at least one Lu AF35700 dose 
to show  a significant improvement on change in total PANSS score over the active control, assuming 
a standard deviation (SD) of 20.
a mean improvement in total PANSS score of 5.25 and 7 for the 2 doses (standardis ed effect size 0.26 and 
0.35)
use of Hochberg’s procedure for multiplicity adjustment at 5% level of significance.
Assuming further an information loss of ~20% due to dropout in Period B, n=225 (=180/0.8) must be 
randomis ed, a total of 675 patients. 
With an attrition rate of ~30% in Period A, approximately 964 (=675/0.7) patients is expected to be enrolled to 
meet the target of randomi sing 675 patients in Period B.
A blinded re- assessment of sample size will be considered if the blinded SD estimate or the dropout rate 
deviates from the assumptions. This re- assessment will be performed when 50% of the patients have completed 
the treatment p eriod. A maximum of 300 randomis ed patien ts per treatment arm will be allow ed in the study. 
The pooled standard deviation w ill be estimated from the Covariance Parameter Estimates from an MMRM 
model identical to the one to be used for the primary analysis, except without the effect of treatment, i.e. the 
following:
The model will include the fixed, categorical effects of country, visit, Period -A-therapy 
(risperidone/olanzapine), Period -A-therapy -by-visit interaction as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of 
baseline score and baseline score -by-visit interaction. An unstructured (co)variance structure w ill be used to 
model the within -patient errors.

Page 10of 92Ethical Rationale for Study and Study Design
Identification of novel antipsychotic agents that can effectively treat patients with schizophrenia w ho have 
failed to respond to antipsychotic therapies represents a great unmet clinical need. Per definition, these 
patients are highly symptomatic w ith associated low  level of functioning and require extensive periods of 
hospital care, which contributes di sproportionally to the overall cost of treating schizophrenia. 
Given the unique receptor binding profile of Lu AF35700 characterised by a high affinity to dopamine D1 and 
serotonin 5 -HT6 receptors combined with a low  level of dopamine D2 interaction, it i s believed that 
LuAF35700 can offer an effective alternative treatment option for patients with treatment -resistant
schizophrenia.
Based on data from the ongoing Phase I programme in patients with schizophrenia, the doses used in the 
current study is cons idered to be safe and well tolerated.  
The current study is a Phase III study included in the Lu AF35700 clinical development programme with the 
aim of generating evidence for efficacy and safety in patients w ith treatment -resistant schizophrenia. The 
design of the current study is in accordance w ith the Declaration of Helsinki (Ethical principles for medical 
research involving human subjects) as w ell as the EMA guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal 
products for treatment -resistant schizophrenia.
In the current study, eligible patients who have had a recent treatment failure will enter a single -blind
treatment period and initiate a treatment trial with either risperidone or olanzapine (tw o well -known and 
widely used antipsychotic agents), to conf irm treatment resistance. Only patients where treatment resistance is 
confirmed will be randomised to double -blind treatment with either Lu AF35700 or to continued treatment 
(risperidone or olanzapine) for a period of 10 w eeks. Patients who respond the ini tial treatment with 
risperidone or olanzapine w ill be excluded from the study. Thus, approximately one third of the confirmed 
treatment -resistant patients will be randomis ed back to the failed treatment used in the initial period of the 
current study. Such study design is considered ethically justifiable given the limited treatment options for this 
patient population.
The duration of the double- blind treatment period in the current study is 10 w eeks in order to provide 
sufficient time to determine the exten t of attainable symptom reduction and allow  safety evaluation. Enrolled 
patients will be asked to visit the site regularly where the investigator w ill evaluate the treatment outcome and 
decide whether it is in the patients’ best interest to continue in the study. Also, patient smay withdraw  from  the 
study at any time, for any reason, specified or unspecified, and without penalty or loss of benefits to which the 
patient is otherwise entitled. All patients enrolled in the current study will be scheduled for a Safety Follow -up 
Visit at the clinic 6 w eeks after last dose of IMP. 
Blood samples for exploratory biomarkers will be collected in an attempt to increase the understanding of the 
properties of Lu AF35700, aetiology of schizophrenia, and the molecular bas is of drug response.

Page 14of 92record, and not in the eCRF). A Safety F ollow -up Visit will not be performed for patients who continue in 
the extension study.
eThis visit is only for patients that withdraw  from  Period B of the study before the scheduled Primary 
Outcome Visit (Week 1 6). P atients withdrawn during Period B (except those w ithdrawing due to withdrawal 
of consent ) will be asked to attend an Efficacy Follow -up v isit at the date of their last scheduled visit of 
Period B (study Week 16) for the assessment of efficacy, safety and concomitant medication . 
fIf the date of a patient visit does not conform to the study plan, subsequent visits should be planned to 
maintain the visit schedule relative to the Baseline 1 Visit.
gThe patient's demographics information (age, sex, race) is to be recorded in the eCRF at informed consent 
signature date.
h T he blood samples for Lu AF35700 (IMP), Lu AF36152 (metabolite), olanzapine, risperidone, and 9 -OH 
risperidone analysis will be drawn as close to the ECG recordings as possible.
iExploratory gene expression profiling (RNA) and me tabolomics/proteomics arean integrated part of the 
study and arecovered by the main Patient Information Sheet. 
jSampling for pharmacogenetics is optional and a separate Patient Information Sheet covers this analysis. This 
sampling should preferably be at the Baseline 1 Visit ,but may be collected at any visit that includes a clinical 
safety laboratory sample.
kSigns and symptoms present at Screening and/or Baseline 1 (before IMP intake) must be recorded on an 
Adverse Event Form .
lOnly for adverse eve nts ongoing at Prim ary Outcome/Withdraw al Visit and new SAEs.
mOnly to be taken if the laboratory test was clinically significantly abnormal at the Prim ary

1.1 Background
1.1.1 Overview
Schizophrenia is a severe, complex, chronic, and disabling ps ychiatric disorder with a lifetime 
prevalence of a round 1%.1Schizophrenia is characterised b y profound disturbances in 
thinking, perception, and emotion and the clinical manifestation of the disease encompasses a 
wide range of s ymptoms such as positive sy mptoms (for example, delusions, hallucinations, 
and disorganised behaviour), negative s ymptoms (for example, affective flattening, social 
withdrawal, anhedonia, and poverty of speech), and symptoms of cognitive impairment (for 
example, impaired executive functioning, working memory , and attention deficits). 
Numerous antips ychotics have been developed which all rel y on the same underl ying 
mechanism, namel y interfering with dopamine receptor s, and more specifically , dopamine D 2
receptor antagonism. Therapies with phenothiazines, such as haloperidol and thio thixene, are 
effective but induce extra py ramidal symptoms ( EPS)such as dy stonia, muscle rigidity , 
tremor, and akathisia.2Long-term effects, which develop after months to y ears of therap y, 
also include tardive d yskinesia. The above -mentioned drugs are re ferred to as ty pical or 
conventional antips ychotics and the adverse effects appear to be directly  related to the 
dopamine D 2receptor blockade in the basal ganglia,3whereas the antips ychotic effect of these 
compounds is dependent on reducing dopamine D 2mediated neurotransmission in the 
mesolimbic tracts (including the nucleus accumbens, stria terminalis, and the olfactory  
tubercle).
Lu AF35700 is a novel deuterated compound with affinity  for dopaminergic, serotonergic, 
and α -adrenergic receptors. The rece ptor binding profile and the pharmacological properties 
derived from animal experiments indicate that LuAF35700 possesses antipsy chotic activity  
combined with a benign tolerability  profile.
The following sections 1.1.2 to 1.1.5 provide an overview of the nonclinical and clinical data 
currentl y available for Lu AF35700. Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure4for more detailed 
information.
1.1.2 Nonclinical Pharmacology
Lu AF3 5700 is a novel deuterated compound with affinity  for serotonergic, dopaminergic, 
and α -adrenergic receptors, and acts as an antagonist of those receptor ty pes.  The multi-
receptor profile of Lu AF35700 is believed to have an antipsy chotic effect.
Lu AF357 00 has similar high affinity  for the human serotonergic 5- HT 2A and 5 -HT 6 receptors.  
Like “at ypical antipsychotics”, the affinity  for the human 5 -HT 2Areceptor is substantially  
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 25of 92higher than for the dopamine D 2receptor.  Distinctively , Lu AF35700 has higher affinity  for 
the human dopamine D 1receptor than it has for the human dopamine D 2receptor.
The in vitro receptor profile of high affinit y for 5 -HT 2Aand 5 -HT 6receptors and low affinit y 
for dopamine D 2receptors was confirmed b y in vivo occupancy  studies .  The predicted 
stead y-state concentration resulting in 50% target occupancy  (EC 50) was calculated based on 
in vivo occupancy  and pharmacokinetic (PK) data from rats.  The EC 50for 5 -HT 6(12 ng/mL) 
and 5 -HT 2A(20 ng/mL) receptors is equipotent and much lo wer than for dopamine D 1
(115 ng/mL) and dopamine D 2(255 ng/mL) receptors.
The potent binding to dopamine D 1receptors combined with a lower affinity  for the dopamine 
D2receptors is believed to result in a beneficial efficacy profile and a tolerability  profile 
without the troublesome adverse effects associated with extensive dopamine D 2receptor 
blockade, such as extrapy ramidal sy mptoms (EPS), hy perprolactinaemia, sexual dy sfunction, 
and dy sphoria/anhedonia.  Furthermore, given the lack of muscarinic rece ptor blockade, it is 
expected that Lu AF35700 will not have a negative impact on cognitive performance related 
to muscarinic receptor inhibition.
In animal models, Lu AF35700 inhibited conditioned avoidance responding (CAR), 
amphetamine -induced hyperactivi ty, and phency clidine (PCP) -induced hy peractivity  at doses 
having no sedative or motor inhibiting effects, indicative of antipsy chotic potential combined 
with few side effects.
Lu AF36152 is the major metabolite of Lu AF35700 and has a pharmacological in vitroand 
in vivo profile which is similar to that of L u AF35700 although it is less potent in vivo .
1.1.3 Phar macokinetics and Metabolism in Animals
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties of L u AF35700 
have been characterised i n the animal species used for safety  assessment:  Lu AF35700 is well 
absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (94% in the rat) and the time to maximum observed 
concentration (t max) is 0.5 to 1 hour post- dose in rats and dogs.  It is distributed throughout all 
tissues, including the brain.  The protein binding of L u AF35700 is high (95% to 98%) in 
plasma from mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and humans.  The main route of excretion in rats and 
dog is via the faeces.  
Overall, the metabolic pathway s across species are similar and all metabolites observed in 
humans were observed in at least one animal species used for safet y evaluation. Relative 
abundance measurements in plasma following multiple oral administrations showed that the 
potential relevant human metaboli tes have been adequatel y safet y tested in the animal toxicity  
studies in line with the regulatory  recommendations.
In human hepatocy tes, the major metabolite was the N -desmeth yl metabolite (Lu AF36152).  
Other metabolites included two mono- hydroxy metabol ites, a possible O- methy l catechol 
metabolite, two dihy drodiols, and two mono -hydroxy  metabolites of Lu AF36152.
H.Lundbeck A/S

Page 26of 92At the predicted therapeutic plasma concentrations of L u AF35700 and Lu AF36152, the 
drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential due to CYP inhibitio n or CYP induction appears to be 
low.  As the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 are the major CYP enzy mes responsible for the overall 
metabolism of L u AF35700, strong inhibitors of these enz ymes or CYP2D6 poor metaboliser 
status may  result in elevated plasma concentrati ons.
1.1.4 Nonclinical Safety Studies
Safety  pharmacology  studies were conducted with L u AF35700 to examine the effect on the 
major phy siological functions (central nervous sy stem [CNS], cardiovascular, and respiratory  
systems) in rats and dogs.  The tolerabilit y and toxicity  of Lu AF35700 was evaluated by  oral 
treatment for up to 13 weeks in mice, 26 weeks in rats, and 39 weeks in dogs.  The potential 
genotoxicity  of Lu AF35700 was evaluated in vitro and in vivo.   The effect of L uAF35700 on 
fertility  and earl y embryonic development was assessed in the rat, and foetal developmental 
toxicity  was assessed in rats and rabbits. 
Both Lu AF35700 and its major metabolite L u AF36152 show high affinity to cardiac ion 
channels in in vitro systems.  I n a manual patch clamp assay , both compounds inhibited the 
human ether -à-go-go-related gene (hERG) ion channel with concentrations resulting in 50% 
inhibition (I C50) of 0.060 µM and 0.177 µM for Lu AF35700 and Lu AF36152, respectivel y.   
In dogs, electrocardiogram (ECG) wavefo rm morphology  changes (ventricular ectopic beats) 
were observed in the cardiovascular safet y pharmacology study and in the 4 -week oral 
toxicity  study  but ventricular ectopic beats were not seen in dogs after 13 and 39 weeks of 
dosing.  An increase in QT cinterval was observed at the highest dose during Weeks 6 and 13 
in the 13 -week oral toxicity  study , but QT cprolongation was not observed in the 39 -week 
toxicity  study ; although these ECG changes could not be clearl y attributed to treatment, a 
drug-related effect cannot be excluded.
The principal target organs identified in the repeated dose toxicity  studies were the central 
nervous s ystem (clinical observations in mice, rats, and dogs), the rodent mammary  gland 
(prolactin -mediated effects in female mice, male, and female rats), the rodent female 
reproductive organs (prolactin -mediated effects on uterus in rats, and vagina in mice and rats), 
the lungs (phospholipidosis in rats), and the heart (ECG changes in dogs). 
Lu AF35700 was not genotoxic in standard re gulatory  in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity  tests.  
The no-observed-adverse- effect levels (NOAELs) established in the toxicity  studies were 
20(males)/30 (females) mg/kg/day  in the mouse, 40 (males)/80 (females) mg/kg/day  in the 
rat, and 3 mg/kg/day in the dog.  The overall NOAEL  at 3 mg/kg/day  Lu AF35700 was 
established based on a reduced weight gain and an effect on the ECG (QT cprolongation and 
ventricular ectopic beats) at the highest dose in dogs. 
The behavioural and clinical observations in the anima ls and the toxicological target organs 
defined were as predicted from the pharmacological and chemical properties of Lu AF35700.  
Apart from the potential risk of ECG changes, no other effects of Lu AF35700 are considered 
relevant for humans at exposure le vels corresponding to those achieved the highest dose

ratios.
It is concluded that the toxicological effects of L u AF35700 were well characterised in the 
toxicology , genotoxicity , and reproductive toxicology  studies and the results support that 
LuAF35700 can safel y be administered to humans at the proposed dose levels .
1.1.5 Clinical Data
1.1.5.1 Overview of Studies
Currently , three studies with L u AF35700 have been completed in healthy subjects 
(Studies 14198A, 15867A, and 15868A).  One study  in patients has been completed 
experimentally  (Study  14754A).  Finall y, two studies are ongoing (Studies 15859A and 
16156A).  As of August 2015, a total of 74 healthy  subjects and 84 patients with 
schizophrenia have been exposed to L u AF35700.
The completed studies in healthy  subjects (all men) comprise the first- in-human (FIH) study , 
an AME study , and a PET study .  In the FIH study , 6 subjec ts received a single 10 mg dose 
and 20 subjects received 3 mg Lu AF35700 together with 3 mg of a non- deuterated 
LuAF35700 analogue once dail y for 18 days.   In each of the AME and PET studies, 
6subjects received a single dose of 30 mg Lu AF35700.  Based o n these studies, L u AF35700 
was safe and well tolerated.
A multiple -ascending -dose (MAD) stud y in 96 patients with schizophrenia has been 
completed experimentally  and preliminary  unblinded data are included in this document.  The 
study  was a double -blind, placebo- controlled study with 10 cohorts of up to 10 patients each.  
The treatment duration was 21 day s in all cohorts.  I n Cohorts 1 to 7, collectively  referred to 
as Part A, male patients received daily  doses of 5, 7.5, 11, 16, 20, or 30 mg/day .  In Coho rts 1 
to 6, the patients were randomised (7 to 3, respectively ) to receive oral solutions of 
LuAF35700 or placebo, and in Cohort 7, all patients received a 20 mg Lu AF35700 tablet 
(one-half of the patients in this cohort received the tablet in a fasted state and the other half 
received the tablet in a fed state).  In Cohort 8, the sole cohort in Part B, women with 
schizophrenia were randomised (7 to 3, respectively ) to receive an oral solution of 
LuAF35700 or placebo.  I n Cohorts 9 and 10, collectivel y referred to as Part C, male and 
female patients were randomised (7 to 3, respectively) to receive oral solutions of 45 mg 
(Cohort 9) or 75 mg (Cohort 10) Lu AF35700 or placebo once weekl y.  In all cohorts, patients 
who received doses ≥20 mg were up -titrated ;refer to the Investigator Brochure4for detailed 
information about the titration schedules used in each cohort.
Study  15859A is an ongoing open -label PET study investigating the occupancy -plasma -
concentration relationship of the D 1, D2, and 5- HT 6receptors in men with schizophrenia. The 
occupancy -plasma -concentration relationship for each of the D 1, D2, and 5- HT 6receptors is 
investigated in a separate group.  In each of the D 1, D2, and 5- HT 6 groups, up to four
sequential cohorts of 2 patients each, receive Lu AF35700 doses for up to 21 days starting at

Study  16156A is an ongoing r andomised, double- blind, parallel -group, placebo- controlled 
single -and multiple -dose study  investigating the safety, tolerability , and PK properties of 
LuAF35700 in healthy  Japanese and Caucasian men.  The study  consist of three parts:  
PartA, in which Japanese and Caucasian men receive a single dose of 5 mg Lu AF35700; 
Part B, in which Japanese men receive a single dose of 10 mg Lu AF35700; and Part C, in 
which Japanese and Caucasian men receive a dose of 10 mg/day  Lu AF35700 for 5 day s.
1.1.5.2 Pharmacokinetic s
A preliminary  integrated popPK analy sis was performed on data from Studies 14198A, 
14754A, 15867A, and 15868A.  
In the popPK model, the absorption phase was adequately  described by  first-order absorption 
(absorption rate constant [k a] = 0.27 L /h) with l ag-time (1 h).  The distribution profiles of both 
Lu AF35700 and Lu AF36152 were best described by  two-compartment models with central 
and peripheral compartments.  The population volume of distribution of L u AF35700 and 
LuAF36152 was estimated to 5442 an d 4933 L, respectivel y. Plasma protein binding was 
investigated in vitro in human plasma and, overall, L u AF35700 was classified as “highl y” 
protein bound (95% to 99%).  The apparent oral clearance of Lu AF35700 and L uAF36152 
was estimated to 29 L /h and 1 5 L/h, respectively .  From the population estimates, the 
elimination half -life for Lu AF35700 and Lu AF36152 was estimated to 143 hours and 
250hours, respectively .
Preliminary results from the MAD study  indicate that for the patients receiving 
therapeutic ally relevant doses of Lu AF35700, the parent compound at Day  21/24 had a 
median t maxof 8hours, mean C maxranging from 24.6 to 43.8 ng/mL, and mean area under the 
curve from zero to 24 hours (AUC 0-24h)ranging from 455 to 759 ng·h/mL.  For the major 
meta bolite L uAF36152, the corresponding values were a median t maxranging from 9 to 
14hours, mean C maxranging from 25.2 to 43.8 ng/mL , and mean AUC 0-24h ranging from 475 
to 685 ng·h/mL .
Please refer to theInvestigator’s Brochure4for a summary of PK parameters.
1.1.5.3 Safety
The main body  of safet y data in patients with schizophrenia comes from the MAD study 
(Study  14754A) which has been completed.  The other study  in patients with schizophrenia, 
the ongoing PET stud y (Study  15859A), is still blinded. 
In the MAD stud y, the adverse events with the highest incidence (>10%) in the L u AF35700 
groups in the daily  dosing cohorts were:  somnolence (33%), anxiety  (23%), headache (21%, 
placebo level), orthostatic hy potension (19%), dizziness (16%), psy chotic disorder (14%), and 
akathisia (11%).  In the once -weekly dosing cohorts the adverse events occurring in

Page 29of 92≥2patients in the L u AF35700 groups were (number of patients out of 12):  somnolence (5), 
constipation (4), insomnia (3), anxiety  (2), and musculoskeletal pain (2).  In total there was 
1serious adverse event, increased ps ychosis, which necessitated hospitalisation of the patient.  
The patient recovered after 9 day s after treatment with paliperidone.  The investigator 
assessed the causality  as not related to the investigational medicinal product (IMP).  All non-
serious adverse events were of mild to moderate intensity , with the exception of one event of 
severe somnolence which resolved after a few hours.  The blinded data from the ongoing PET 
study  showed that anxiety , insomnia, and headache have been reported as adverse events in 
that study .  
Please refer to the Investigator Brochure4for a summary  of the TEAEs with the highest 
incidence in MAD Stud y 14754A.
In the MAD stud y, an explorative anal ysis of the ef fect of treatment on QT cFindicated a 
treatment and dose -related trend for QT cFprolongation.  None of the patients in the study  had 
any symptoms or QT cFvalues that met the potentially  clinicall y significant (PCS) criterion 
(>500 ms or >60 ms increase fro m baseline) and no observations from ECG or cardiac 
telemetry  were reported as adverse events.  
In the MAD study, in the cohorts with the daily dosing regimen, an increase in creatine 
phosphokinase (CPK) value was observed in the Follow- up Period on asses sment day s 
immediately  after the termination of L uAF35700 treatment or one week thereafter.  The 
increase occurred in all Lu AF35700 dosing groups and was greatest (descending order) in the 
cohorts where patients received 20, 5, and 16 mg/day .  The median CPK values were within 
the reference range (for men:  60 to 400 I U/L) and never >320 IU/L.  The cohort in which 
women were treated with L u AF35700 showed no increase in CPK values during the 
treatment period.  The fractionated CPK anal ysis showed that the post-treatment increased 
CPK values were derived from muscle tissue.  In the cohorts with the once -weekl y dosing 
regimen, t here were no apparent treatment or dose -related trends in mean or individual CPK 
values.  T here were no apparent treatment or dose -related trends in mean or individual data 
for an y of the other clinical laboratory parameters. 
In the MAD stud y, the safety and tolerability was not influenced by the formulation (oral 
solution versus tablet) or the sex of the patient.
The total number of healthy  subjects (74) who have received Lu AF35700 is lower than that 
for patients (84) and they have generall y been exposed to lower doses of Lu AF35700 for 
shorter duration.  However, the most frequently  reported adverse events in healthy  subjects 
(somno lence, fatigue, headache, and dizziness) were similar to those in patients.
Based on safet y and tolerability  data from the single -dose PET and AME studies 
(Studies 15867A and 15868A) and the FIH stud y in healthy  subjects (Study 14198A), and the 
MAD study  in patients with schizophrenia (Study  14754A), a single dose of up to 30 mg 
LuAF35700 and multiple doses in the dose range 5 to 30 mg/day or 45 or 75 mg once weekly  
for 21 day s, are safe and well tolerated .

Page 30of 921.1.6 Target Occupancy
A Lu AF35700 PET study  (Study  15868A) was conducted in 6 y oung healthy  men to 
characterise the relationship between the combined plasma concentration of L u AF35700 and 
Lu AF36152 and the D 2receptor occupancy  using [11C]-PHNO at different time points from 8 
to 126 hours after dosing.5  Apharmacokinetic/pharmacod ynamic (PK/PD) model was 
established to predict the relationship between plasma exposure of Lu AF35700/L u AF36152 
and striatal D 2dopamine receptor occupancy . Two E maxmodels were combined with 
simulated plasma concentrations of L u AF35700 and L u AF36152 when dosing 10 mg and 
20 mg Lu AF35700 QD for 12 weeks. After 5 weeks of daily doses of 10 mg and 20 mg, the 
contribution of both L u AF37500 and Lu AF36152 are expected to result in a 48% and 65% 
D2receptor occupancy , respectivel y.6
1.2 Rationale for the Study
The current study  is a Phase III study  included in the Lu AF35700 clinical development 
program meand will be conducted in order to establish the appropriate clinical effective dose 
range of two fixed doses of Lu AF35700 as a pote ntial treatment of treatment- resistant 
schizophrenia (TRS) .
Clinical studies present an excellent opportunity  for collecting large numbers of biological 
samples from well -characterised patient populations for research on the aetiology  of 
schizophrenia and the molecular basis of the drug response (intended or adverse). Thus, 
samples will be collected for exploratory  biomarker analy ses to investigate associations 
between biological parameters , for example, genetic variants, mRNA concentrations, protein 
or end ogenous metabolite concentrations and clinical features such as disease s ymptoms, drug 
response, and potential adverse events.
Blood samples will be collected in an attempt to increase the understanding of the 
pharmacokinetic properties of Lu AF35700, and its metabolite (Lu AF36152) .

3Study Design
3.1 Overview of the Study Design
This study  has been designed in accordance with theDeclaration of Helsinki.7
This is an interventional, multi -national, multi -site, randomised, double -blind, parallel -group, 
active -controlled, fixed- dose study .
This study  will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice ,8and 
applicable regulatory  requirements.
An overview of the stud y is presented in Panel 1.
The total study  duration per patient from Screening to the end of Follow- Up will be 
approximately  25weeks. The study  will consist of 4 Periods:
•Screening Period (3weeks)
•Period A –Prospective Confirmation Period (6 weeks)
•Period B – Double- blind Treatment Period (10weeks)
•Safet y Follow -Up Period (6 weeks) 
Approximately  675 patients (225 patients per group) are planned to be randomise d in 
Period B.
Patients will enter a Screening Period of up to 21 days to assess eligibility . 
Non-acute male and female patients, aged ≥18 y ears,with a primary  diagnosis of 
schizophrenia according to the DSM- 5™ who meet criteria of treatment resistance will be 
screened for eligibility . Eligible patients will be documented to have failed to show an 
adequate response in their level of antips ychotic symptoms despite at least one treatment with 
an adequate dose of one or more antips ychotic medication(s) for at least 6 weeks during the 
last 2 y ears prior to Screening . 
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 32of 92Patients should be treated with adequate dose(s) and agent(s) of antipsy chotic treatment for at 
least 2 weeks prior to Screening . Current antipsy chotic medication will be down- tapered 
within the first 7 day s of Period A according to Appendix II .
130 sites are planned in approximately 18countries (in- /outpatient clinics) .
Patients, who meet the pre -specified selection criteria, will enter a single-blinded 6-week 
treatment period ( Period A) with risperidone ,9or olanzapine10if they  are currently  treated 
with risperidone or 9-OH-risperidone (Invega™), to prospectivel y confirm their resistance to 
antipsy chotic treatment. Patients who do not fulfil the inclusion criteria for Period B will be 
withdrawn from the study .Current antipsy chotic medication will be dow n-tapered within the 
first 7 day s of Period A as described in s ection 6.1. 
Patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria for lack of clinicall y relevant improvement during 
Period A will be considered treatment -resistant and enter the double -blind treatment period
(Period B). The specific inclusion criteria for Period B will be blinded to the investigators. At 
Baseline 2, patients will be randoml y assigned (1:1:1) to 1 0 weeks of double- blind treatment 
with either Lu AF35700 10 mg/day , Lu AF35700 20 mg/day  or to continue the treatment 
allocated in Period A (risperidone or olanzapine). The randomisation will be stratified by  
country  and Period A therap y. 
All patients, including patients with a clinically  relevant impr ovement, patients who have 
completed the treatment period and those who withdraw , will be scheduled for a Safet y 
Follow -up Visit at the clinic for safet y assessments 42 day s after the last dose of IMP. 
Patients withdrawn during Period B (except those withdrawing due to withdrawal of consent) 
will be asked to attend an Efficacy  Follow -up Visit at the date of their last scheduled visit of 
Period B (Week 16) for the assessment of efficacy, safet y and concomitant medication.
An internal Safet y Committee at H. L undbeck A/S has been established for L u AF35700 and 
the committee will perform regular evaluations of blinded safet y data.
Nointerim anal ysis isplanned.
After completion of the study , the patients will be treated according to normal practis e.
3.2 Rationale f or the Study Design
The randomise d, double -blind, active- controlled, fixed dose design of the study  aims to 
evaluate the safet y and efficacy  of two doses of LuAF35700 in patients with TRS. The 
treatment -resistant criteria used in this study  are failure to respond after two trials of 
antipsy chotic medication of adequate dose and duration of at least 6 weeks.11The first failed 
antipsy chotic trial will be retrospectively  documented as persistent positive sy mptoms and the 
current presence of at least moderatel y severe illness at study inclusion as defined b y 
Inclusion Criteria 9 and 10, as well as persistent illness and drug -refractory  condition as 
defined b y Inclusion Criteri on 8. Patients that meet the above criteria and have been treated 
for at least 2 weeks12with an adequate dose of antipsy chotic will enter a single blinded 
antipsy chotic trial ( Period A) of 6 weeks duration in which they  will be treated with 
H.Lundbeck A/S

Page 33of 92risperidone , or olanzapine if patients were currently  treated with risperidone. The rationale for 
considering two failed trials as sufficient evidence of TRS is supported by  the finding that 
subjects not responding to two adequate antipsychotic trials have less than 7% chance of 
responding to another trial;13a criterion which has been broadly  adapted in r ecent TRS 
studies.14
Patients that fail the treatment assigned during Period A, the criteria of which will be blinded 
to the investigator, will be randomise d to continue treatment with risperidone or olanzapine or 
to treatment with one of two fixed doses of Lu AF35700. The rationale for the choice of 
risperidone or olanzapine for the prospective antipsy chotic trial is their well -established 
efficacy  and effectiveness in drug -responsive patients with schizophrenia; which will enable a 
clear differentiation between responders and non -responders, and thus are an appropriate 
comparator for Lu AF35700 during Period B. In order to rule out lack of treatment adherence 
as one of the possible reasons for treatment failure, blood levels of risperidone plus 9 -OH-
risperi done, and olanzapine will be assessed in Period A.15,16The blinding of the investigators 
to the randomisation criteria at the end of Period A is designed to further reduce possible 
sources of bias in the assessment of efficacy in TRS patients.
In this stud y, patients withdrawing during Period B (except those withdrawing due to 
withdrawal of consent) will be asked to attend an Efficacy  Follow -up Visit, in order to 
achieve a complete as possible dataset from these patients and thereb y minimising bias. The 
prim ary anal ysis assumes data are missing at random. As sensitivity  anal ysis, this assumption 
will be investigated b y utilising the retrieved dropout data from the Efficacy  Follow -up visit.
The doses of risperidone and olanzapine used in this study  are known a ccording to be safe,
effective and well -tolerated.17The 10 and 20 mg doses of Lu AF35700 were determined to be 
safe and well tolerated in the ongoing Phase I programme in patients with schizophrenia and 
elicited the targeted range of D 2receptor occupancy in healthy  volunteers (see Investigator’s 
Brochure ).4The treatment duration of 10 weeks was chosen as an adequate time period 
necessary  to achieve steady -state of the plasma levels of Lu AF35700 and its active
metabolite (Lu AF36152) given their long half -lives and to provide sufficient time to 
determine the extent of attainable s ymptom reduction and allow safety  evaluation .4The 
primary  efficacy  endpoint will be based on the PANSS18a well established scale for assessing 
severit y of the s ymptoms of schizophrenia. The CGI-S19,20will be used as a secondary
efficacy  measure to assess clinical response . The exploratory  assessment of the severit y of the 
negative s ymptoms o f schizophrenia will be done using the NSA -4.21
Improvement in functional outcome and quality of life are important treatment goals in the
management of patients with schizophrenia. In the current study , effects on functional
outcomes will be assessed usin g the PSP .22
Taking into account thesubstantial health economic burden of TRS ,it is also necessary  to 
evaluate the effect of the Lu A F35700 on subjective well -being/ qualit y of life, treatment 
satisfaction, disability  and health care resource utilisation. These will be assessed in the study  
through clinician -reported outcomes such as QLS23andWoRQ24, as well as, patient reported 
outcomes such as SWN -S25,MSQ26,TooL27and HEA .

Page 34of 92Safet y and tolerability  will be assessed by  means of withdrawal, reported adverse ev ents,
vitals signs, weight, clinical safety  laboratory  tests, ECGs, and phy sical examinations.
Metabolic adverse events including bod y weight gain, dyslipidemia, and h ypergl ycemia are
adverse events associated with antipsy chotic treatment and represent an important long -term
safet y risk.28The primary  variables for assessing those parameters include body  weight/BMI, 
waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, gl ycosylated haemoglobin [HbA1c ]and lipids 
(trigl ycerides, total cholesterol, low -density  lipoprote in [LDL ], and high density lipoprotein 
[HDL ] cholesterol).
4Ethics
4.1 Ethical Rationale
A subgroup of patients with schizophrenia show persistent positive psy chotic sy mptoms, at 
least moderatel y severe and persistent illness, and are considered drug- refractory . Such 
patients constitute between 10 and 60% of the total patient population, depending on the 
criteria used to assess TRS.29,30
Identification of novel antipsy chotic agents that can effectivel y treat patients with 
schizophrenia, who have failed to respond to antipsy chotic therapies represents a great unmet 
clinical need. Per definition, these patients are highly  symptomatic with associated low level 
of functioning and require extensive periods of hospital care which contributes 
disproportionally  to the over all cost of treating schizophrenia. 
Given the unique receptor binding profile of Lu AF35700 characterised b y a high affinit y to 
dopamine D 1and serotonin 5 HT6 receptors combined with a low level of dopamine D 2 
interaction, it is believed that L u AF35700 can offer an effective alternative treatment option 
for patients with TRS .
The design of the current study  is in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki7(Ethical 
principles for medical research involving h uman subjects) as well as the EMA guideline on 
clinical investigation of medicinal products for treatment- resistant schizophrenia .31
In the current study , eligible patients who have had a recent treatment failure will enter a 
single -blind treatment period andinitiate a treatment trial with either risperidone or 
olanzapine (two well -known and widel y used antipsychotic agents) to confirm treatment 
resistance. Only  patients where treatment resistance is confirmed will be randomised to 
double -blind treatment wi th either L u AF35700 or to continued treatment (risperidone or 
olanzapine) for a period of 10 weeks. Patients who respond the initial treatment with 
risperidone or olanzapine will be excluded from the study . Thus, approximately  one third of 
the confirmed t reatment- resistant patients will be randomise d back to the failed treatment 
used in the initial period of the current study . Such study  design is considered ethically  
justifiable given the limited treatment options for this patient population.

Page 35of 92The duration of the double -blind treatment period in the current study  is 10 weeks in order to 
provide sufficient time to determine the extent of attainable sy mptom reduction and allow 
safet y evaluation. Enrolled patients will be asked to visit the site regularl y, where the 
investigator will evaluate the treatment outcome and decide whether it is in the patients’ best
interest to continue in the study . Also, the patient may  withdraw from the study  at an y time, 
for an y reason, specified or unspecified, and without penal ty or loss of benefits to which the 
patient is otherwise entitled. All patients enrolled in the current study  will be scheduled for a 
Safet y Follow -up Visit at the clinic 6 weeks after last dose of IMP . Patients withdrawn during 
Period B (except those with drawing due to withdrawal of c onsent) will be asked to attend an 
Efficacy  Follow -up Visit at the date of the irlast scheduled visit of Period B (stud y Week 16) 
for the assessment of efficacy , safet y and concomitant medication.
In accordance with Good Clinical Practice ,8qualified medical personnel at Lundbeck will be 
readil y available to advi seon study -related medical questions. Medical monitoring will be 
performed throughout the study . Safet y data will be revi ewed regularl y by the Lundbeck
LuAF35700 Safety  Committee to ensure that prompt action is taken, if needed, to maximise
patient safet y.
In accordance with Good Clinical Practice ,8the investigator will be resp onsible for all study -
related medical decisions.
4.2 Informed Consent
No study -related procedures, including an y screening procedures, may be performed before 
the investigator has obtained written informed consent from the patient andhis or her legal
representative (if applicable) and informant/caregiver (if applicable per local requirements). 
Changing (for example, discontinuing or down- tapering) a patient’s concomitant medications 
prior to the Screening Visit to ensure that the patient meets the selection c riteria is a study -
related activity  and must not occur before the Informed Consent Form has be ensigned.
As fasting samples are to be taken at the Screening Visit , the Informed Consent Form must be 
signed a suitable number of day s before the Screening Visit.
If the informed consent process may be delegated , the requirements for the delegates must be
documented prior to the start of the stud y. National laws must always be adhered to when 
allowing potential delegation. Any delegation must be documented in the site delegation log .
The Investigator must exclude an y adult patient who lackscapacit y to consent for himself/
herself from participation in the study .The investigator must identify  vulnerable patients, that 
is, patients whose willingness to participate in thisstudy  might be unduly influ enced b y the 
expectation ,regardless of whether it is justified, of benefits associated with participation, or 
of a retaliatory  response from senior members of a hierarchy  in case of refusal to participate.
Patients thus identified must be excluded from participation in the study .
Prior to obtaining written informed consent, the investigator or a designee must explain to the 
patients and their legal representatives (if applicable) and informant/caregiver (if applicable 
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 36of 92per local requirements) the aims, methods, and potential hazards of the study  and any  
discomfort it may  entail. The patients andtheir legal representatives (if applicable) and 
informant/caregiver (if applicable per local requirements) must be informed that their 
participation in the study  is voluntary  and that they are free to withdraw from the study  at an y 
time without justify ing their decision. The p atients and their legal representatives (if
applicable) and informant/caregiver (if appli cable per local req uirements) must be informed of 
the possibility  of withdrawing consent (section 8.3).
The p atients and their legal representatives (if applicable) and informant/caregiver (if 
appli cable per local requirements) must be given ample time and opportunity  to enquire about 
details of the study prior to deciding whether to participate in the study .
The Informed Consent Form includes a statement whereb y the patient agrees to communicate 
with their regular doctor of their participation in the study . If the patient does not want his/her 
regular doctor to be contacted and there is no other way  to verify  or establish that the patient 
qualifies for the stud y, the patient should not be enrolled .
It is the responsibility  of the i nvestigator to ensure that all questions about the study  are 
answered to the satisfaction of the patients and their legal representatives (if applicable) and 
informant/caregiver (if appli cable per local requirements). Prior to including a patient in the 
study, an Informed Consent Form must be signed and dated by the patient and his or her legal 
representative (if applicable) and informant/caregiver (if app licable per local requirements)
and signed and dated by  the investigator or a designee. The patients and their legal 
representatives (if applicable) and informant/caregiver (if applicable per local requirements)
must receive a cop y of the written information ( Patient Information Sheet ) as well as a copy  
of the signed Informed Consent Form .
The consent proce dures described above will only  be implemented if allowed by  local law 
and regulations and will only  be initiated after approval by  the relevant ethics committees.
The blood samples for exploratory  biomarker analy sis may  be shared with academic or public 
institutions; however, Lundbeck will retain full control of the samples and their use in 
accordance with the information in the Patient Information Sheet and a material transfer 
agreement.
4.3 Personal Data Protection
Inaccordance with European Union Directive 95/46/EC ,32the data will be processed in 
accordance with the specifications outlined by  the Danish Data Protection Agency  to ensure 
that requirements regarding personal data protection are met . If an external organisation will 
process data on behalf of Lundbeck , a contractual procedure will be signed between 
Lundbeck and the external organisation to ensure compliance with the above -mentioned 
legislation.
If applicable, the participation of patients in this study  willbe reported to the appropriate local 
data protection agencies , in accordance with European Union Directive 95/46/EC,32and 
country -specific guidelines and laws.

6Investigational Medicinal Product s
6.1 Treatment Regimen
Patients, who meet the pre -specified selection criteria (including the criteria for treatment 
resistance), will enter a single (patient) -blinded treatment period with risperidone9or 
olanzapine10to confirm their resistance to antips ychotic treatment at Baseline 1. Patients will 
be initiated on risperidone 2 mg/day  and up -titrated to 6 mg/day  by the end of the first week, 
except if they  have failed on risperidone (or 9 -OH-risperidone; Invega™) in the most recent 
treatment trial, in which case patients will be initiated on olanzapine at 5 mg/day  and up -
titrated to 15 mg/day  by the end of the first week. Current antipsy chotic medication will be 
down -tapered within the first 7 days of this treatment period. Patients will be up -titrated 
according to the following scheme:
Risperidone: 2 mg/day  for the first 2 days; 4 mg/day for the next 2 day s; 6mg/day  for 
the last 3 day s
Olanzapine: 5 mg/day  for the first 2 day s; 10 mg/day for the next 2 day s; 15 mg/day  
for the last 3 day s
In the subsequent week patients will receive either risperidone 6 mg/day  or olanzapine 
15mg/day  and thereafter either risperidone 4 or 6 mg/day  or olanzapine 15 or 20 mg/day  for 
the subsequent four weeks, which can be increased for efficacy  or decreased for tolerability
between weeks 2 and 4, according to the investigator’s clinical judgement. Patients will be 
treated with at least 6 mg/da y of risperidone (or with 4 mg/day  in case the dose of 6 mg was 
not tolerated and had to be reduced) or with at least 15 mg/day of olanzapine for the last 2 
weeks. Patients currentl y treated with ‘depot’ antipsy chotic medications can, after signing the 
ICF, be down -tapered b y skipping one full treatment cy cle plus 3 day s before Baseline 1. 
Patients who do not fulfil the inclusion criteria for Period B will be withdrawn from the stud y.  
If the patient is withdrawn during Period A, the investigator will have the option to continue 
the patient on the treatment assigned during Period A, as prescribed b y the investigator, or 
discontinue I MP.
Patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria for lack of clinicall y relevant improvement during 
Period A will be considered treatment -resistant and enter the double -blind treatment period
(Period B) at Baseline 2. The specific inclusion criteria for Period B will be blinded to the 
investigators. Patients will be randomly  assigned (1:1:1) to 1 0 weeks of double- blind 
treatment wit h either Lu AF35700 10 mg/day, Lu AF35700 20 mg/day,or to continue the

Page 44of 92treatment allocated in Period A at the dose set at last visit of Period A (Week 4).  The 
randomisation will be stratified b y countr y and Period A therap y (risperidone or olanzapine). 
No dose adjustments will be allowed during Period B. Patients randomise d to L u AF35700 
will be initiated on L u AF35700 10 mg/day  without titration or 20 mg/day  starting with 10 mg 
for 4 day s followed b y 20 mg/day  thereafter. For the patients randomise d to L u AF35700,
discontinuation of risperidone or olanzapine will be done graduall y in a blinded fashion and 
completed in the 7 days following Baseline 2 according to the following scheme:
•Risperidone: 4 mg/day  for the first 3 days; 2 mg/day  for the 4 subsequen t day s
•Olanzapine: 10 mg/day  for the first 3 days; 5 mg/day  for the 4 subsequent day s
At the Primary  Outcome or Withdrawal Visit for all patients, including those who withdraw 
from the study  for any  reason after Week 1 of Period A or an ytime during Period B, 
discontinuation of I MP will be initiated according to the following scheme :
•Risperidone: 4 mg/day  for the first 3 days; 2 mg/day  for the 4 subsequent day s
•Olanzapine: 10 mg/day  for the first 3 days; 5 mg/day  for the 4 subsequent day s
•Lu AF35700: Placeb o for 7 day s
In order to reduce biases associated with changes in treatment between the study  period s and 
for blinding purposes during the down titration of risperidone or olanzapine, patients will be 
given two identical capsules per day  throughout all tre atment periods.
The patients will be instructed to take 2 capsules, for oral use, together in the morning or 
evening .The capsules are to be swallowed whole.
At Visit 2 (Baseline 1), t he first dose is to be taken the day  after study  medication has been 
dispensed to the patient .
For patients taking IMP in the morning, on scheduled visit day s, they  should not take IMP in 
the morning prior to the visit.  I MP should be taken from the new wallet card dispensed the 
day of the visit, after all blood samples have been taken as part of the visit procedures.
For patients taking IMP in the evening, on scheduled visit day s, patients will take their IMP 
from the new wallet card dispensed the day  of the visit.
For tolerability reasons, the investigator may  decide to swit ch the patient’s dosing schedule 
from evening to morning OR morning to evening.   If the patient switches at a specific visit, 
then it is acceptable to skip one dose of IMP.
All wallet cards should be returned at the next study  visit for new wallet cards t o be dispensed 
to the patient.
IMPs, Formulations, and Strengths
The IMPs supplied by  Lundbeck in this study  are:
•Lu AF35700 -encapsulated tablets in strengths of 10 and 20 mg
•Risperidone - encapsulated tablets in strengths of 2 and 4 mg
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 45of 92•Olanzapine - e ncapsulated tablets in strengths of 5, 10 and15 mg
•Placebo -encapsulated tablets
The IMPs will be identical in appearance.
6.2 Manufacturing, Packaging, Labelling, and Storage of IMPs
The IMP swill be manufactured, packaged, labelled, released (b y a qualified p erson [QP]), 
and distributed in accordance with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice , under the 
responsibility  of Lundbeck.
The IMP will be provided in wallet cards containing 20 capsules.
The wording on the labels will be in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice regarding 
labelling and national and/or local regulatory  requirements. If additional information is to be 
added when theIMP is dispensed to patients, this will be clearl y stated on the labels, and the 
investigator will be instructed to do so.
No manipulation, repackaging, or relabelling of IMP is permitted after QP release by  
Lundbeck, unless a repackaging/relabelling agreement exists, and the documentation is 
available to the Department of Clinical Supply , H. L undbeck A/S , and, wher e necessary , new 
QP releases are made.
The IMP s will be identified using a unique IMP number.
The IMPs must be stored in a safe and secure location, and in accordance with the storage 
conditions specified on the labels.
6.3 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment
The patients will be assigned a screening number by the eCRF s ystem, and that number will 
be used to identify  them throughout the stud y.
An Interactive Voice Response Sy stem (IVRS) will be used in this study .When a patient is to 
be randomised, the i nvestigator will contact the IVRS. The I VRS will allocate the patient to a 
treatment group during the call and assign the patient a randomisation number in accordance 
with the specifications from the Department of Biostatistics, H. Lundbeck A/S, and then 
follow up by  fax, e -mail, or the web (depending on availability  or preference at the site).
6.4 IMP Accountability
The IMPs must be tracked at each site using two logs:
•a site -specific log to track the complete inventory  (that is, what is shipped between the site 
and L undbeck)
•a patient -specific log to track what is dispensed to and returned by  the patient
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 46of 92The investigator and the pharmacist (if applicable) must agree to onl y dispense IMP to 
patients enrolled in the study . The investigator or the pharmacist (if applicable) must maintain 
an adequate record of the receipt and distribution of the IMPs. This record must be available 
for inspection at an y time.
6.5 Unblinding Procedures
Division of Global Pharmacoviligance (GPV ), and the investigator or the pharmacist (if
applicable) will have access to the details of the double -blind treatment for each patient. 
Access to these details will be via IVRS. 
The IVRS unblinding procedure is described in the IVRS User Guide .
The investigator may  only  break the code if knowledge of the IMP is necessary  to provide 
optimal treatment to the patient in an emergency  situation. I f possible, the investigator must 
consult the CRA before breaking the code. The investigator must record the date, time, and 
reason for breaking the code on the IMP Code Break Form (this corresponds to the Primary  
Outcome /Withdrawal Visit, as the patient must be immediately  withdrawn from the study ) 
and sign the form. If the emergency  situation was an adverse event, it must be recorded on an 
Adverse Event Form . The CRA must be notified immediately .
The IVRS will also capture the date and time of the code break call. Information on the 
allocated treatment will be provided during the call and by  fax or e -mail, depending on 
availability /preference.
6.6 Post-study Acces s to IMP (s)
Patients who completed treatment of Period B (Visit 12) may  continue into the optional 52-
weeks open -label extension study  16159B , if informed consent has been obtained and if 
eligible as judged b y the investigator. For patients who do not continue into the extension 
study , the patient should be treated according to the current clinical practise at the discretion 
of the investigator.
7Concom itant Medication
Concomitant medication is any  medication other than the IMP sthat is taken during the study,
including Screening .
The recent and concomitant medications that are disallowed or allowed with restrictions 
during the stu dy are summarised in Appendix II .
Details of all concomitant medication (prescription and over -the-counter) taken <3 months 
prior to the Screening Visit must be recorded in the eCRF at the first visit. Any  changes 
(including reason for changes) in concomitant medication must be recorded at each 
subsequent visit. 
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 47of 92For an y concomitant medica tion initiated or for which the dose has changed due to a new 
disorder or worsening of a concurrent disorder , the disorder must be recorded as an adverse 
event.
Concomitant medication associated with adverse event s and SAEs, initiated after the last dose 
of IMP ,must be recorded.
The use of potent CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 inhibitors and CYP3A4 inducers is not permitted
during the stud y, as they  may  affect the pharmacokinetic properties of risperidone or 
olanzapine in a manner that would require dose adjustment.9,10Examples of inhibitors and 
inducers are provided in Appendix II .
8Study Visit Plan
8.1 Overview
An overview of the procedures and ass essments to be conducted during the study  and their 
timing is presented in Panel 2. Further details are in chapter 9.
After completing or withdrawing from the study, the patient must be treated in accordanc e 
with usual clinical practice .
8.2 Screening Visit (Visit 1)
Informed consent must be obtained before an y study -related procedures are initiated, 
including washout of disallowed medicatio ns. After informed consent is obtained, d own 
tapering of depot antipsychotic medications and washout of disallowed medications begins, if 
applicable, and must comply with the requirements listed in Appendix II . The screening 
period begins at the Screening Visit . Screening evaluations are described in Panel 2.
The Screening Visit assessments may  be extended over several day s if needed. The date of the 
first assessment shou ld be entered in eCRF as the Visit Date.
The patient ’s eligibility  assessment will be reviewed by  an external medical team based on 
key protocol inclusion and exclusion criteri a to promote appropriate patient enrollment and 
data quality . Sites should submi t specific screening information within 72 hours from the 
Screening Visit for review by  external medical team or sponsor prior to proceeding to 
Baseline 1.
Decisions regarding inclusion of patients and assessment of patient safet y throughout the trial 
prim arily remain at the discretion of the investigator; however, the s ponsor or external 
medical team may request exclusion or discontinuation of a patient based on entry  criteria or 
patient safet y.

8.2.1 Pre-screening
Each site must record in a pre -screening log , which patients attended the Screening Visit.
8.2.2 Patient Identification Card
Each patient will be provide d with a patient identification c ardthat states, at a minimum, the 
name of the IMP, the study  number, the patient identification number, the investigator’s 
name, and an emergency  telephone number providing 24- hour service.
Thepatient identification card should be returned to the investigator upon completion of the 
patient’s participation in the study .
8.2.3 Re-screening
Re-screening is not allowed in this study .
8.3 Outpatient Hospitalisation
Transient outpat ient hospitali sation of up to 5 days duration, which according to the 
investigator judge ment might benefit a patient in the course of the study , must be approved in 
advance b y the stud y's Medical Expert. Such hospitalisations might be extended up to a 
maximum of two additional periods of 3 day s with approval of the Medical Expert .The 
number hospitalis ation day s of patients during the study  will be captured at every visit in the 
eCRF.
8.4 Withdrawal Visit
Patients who withdraw from the study  prior to the Primary  Outcome Visit will be asked to 
attend a Withdrawal Visit , if at all possible. The visit must be scheduled as soon as possible 
after withdrawal.
No new information will be collected from patients who withdraw, except information 
collected in relation to the scheduled Withdrawal Visit or needed for the follow-u p of adverse 
events (section 10.5).
The reason for withdrawal must be recorded on the Reason for Withdrawal Form .
For a patient and his or her legal representative (if applicable) who withdraw (s)consent:
•if the patient and his or her legal representative (if applicable) withdraw (s)consent during 
a visit and then agrees to it being the final visit, the investigator will complete the visit as a 
Withdrawal Visit and all the data collected up to and including this visit will be used

will be used
refuses to attend a Withdrawal Visit, the investigator should attempt to follow the 
patient’s safet y and future treatment ; any information collected will only  be recorded in 
the patient’s medical record
•if the patient andhis or her legal representative (if applicable) explicitly  request (s)that his 
or her data collected from the time of withdrawal of consent onwards not be used, this will

8.5 Safety Follow -up Visit/Contact (Visit 13)
The safety  follow -up is conducted to capture serious adverse events (SAEs) events that occur 
during the Safet y Follow -up Period as well as to follow up on the outcome of adverse events 
ongoing at the end of the Treatment Period. The safet y follow -up must be conducted 
approximately  42days after last dose of IMP as a visit to the site .
For adverse events that were ongoing at the end of the Treatment Period and that resolved 
during the Safet y Follow -up Period, the stop date must be recor ded. For non -serious adverse 
events still ongoing at the safet y follow -up, the stop date must be recorded as “ongoing”. 
SAEs must be followed until resolution or the outcome is known.
Patients with a clinical safety laboratory  test value that was out-of- range at the Primary  
Outcome or Withdrawal Visit and judged clinically  significant must be followed according to 
accepted medical standards for up to 42days or until the value normalises orstabilises or a 
diagnosis or a reasonable e xplanation has been esta blished. For these patients, safet y follow-
up visits must be scheduled to allow for a medical examination and/or blood sampling. The 
investigator must decide whether further safet y follow -up visits are required after 42days. If 
further safet y follow- up vi sits are made, these must be documented in the patient’s medical 
record and not in the eCRF.
Patients who withdrew due to elevated AST or ALT values (see section 5.4) should be 
followed until the values normalis eor stabilise or a diagnosis or a reasonable explanation has 
been established (see section 10.5).
The safety  follow -up for patients who withdraw consent must be performed, if at all possible; 
any information collected will be recorded in the patients’ medical records.
No Safet y Follow -up Visit is to be performed for patients who continue in the extension 
study .

Page 51of 92the clinician starts asking questions from the next module. A cli nician can use the MINI- Schz 
after a short training session. I t takes approximately  20 minutes to administer the MINI -Schz.
The MINI -Schz will be administered in the local language. Only scales provided by  H. 
Lundbeck A/S and that have been validated in th e language to which they  have been 
translated will be used in this study . 
Detailed instructions on how to administer the MINI -Schz will be provided to the site.
9.1.3.2 Rater Qualification and Certification for MINI -Schz
The MINI -Schz must only be administrated b y clinicians having experience with structured 
interviews in patients with schizophrenia. Any exceptions must be discussed and approved b y 
Lundbeck.
A clinician in the context of the study  is defined as a Medical Doctor (MD), Doctor of 
Osteopathic Medicine (DO), or an yone holding a Doctoral or Master’s Degree (or equivalent) 
in a medical or ps ychology related field.
A MINI -Schz training session will be organised prior to the start of the study . Documentation 
of rater training and certification will be deli vered to raters for archiving in the I -TMF. No 
patient must be rated before the documentation has been delivered. New raters joining the 
study  will be trained and certified using the same certification processes.
Rater training and certification will be co nducted by  a third part y vendor selected b y the 
sponsor.
9.1.4 Drug Screen
A urine drug screen for opiates, methadone, cocaine, amphetamines (including 
ecstas y/methamphetamine), barbiturates, benzodiazepines, phencyclidine ,and cannabinoids
will be performed at designated times , but can be performed at an y time during the stud y at 
the discretion of the investigator.

Confidential
Page 52of 92The PANSS will be administered in the local language. The PSP and CGI -S will be 
administered in English only. Only scales provided by H. Lundbeck A/S and that have been 
validated in the language to which they  have been translated will be used in this study .
Detailed instructions on how to administer the scales and how to score using the scales will be 
provided to the site.
9.2.1.1 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
The PANSS18is a clinician -rated scale designed to measure severit y of ps ychopathology in 
adult patients with schizophrenia, sc hizoaffective disorders, and other psychotic disorders. It 
emphasises positive and negative s ymptoms. The PANSS comprises 3 sub -scales with a total 
of 30 items: 7 items constitute the Positive Sy mptoms subscale (for example: delusions, 
conceptual disorgani zation , and hallucinatory  behaviour), 7 items constitute the Negative 
Symptoms subscale (for example: blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, and poor rapport), 
and 16 items constitute the General Psy chopathology  subscale (for example: somatic concern, 
anxie ty, and guilt feelings). Each item is rated from 1 (sy mptom not present) to 7 (sy mptom 
extremely  severe). Raters using the PANSS should have training in ps ychiatric interview 
techniques and have clinical experience working with patients with schizophrenia and related 
psychotic disorders. The Structured Clinical Interview for PANSS35(SCI –PANSS) will be 
used to facilitate the administration of the PANSS assessment. The structured questionnaire 
PANSS Checklist will be used to collect the PANSS informant data i n a consistent manner 
throughout the stud y.
It takes 30 to 40 minutes to administer and score the PANSS.
9.2.1.2 Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP)
The PSP22is a clinician -rated scale designed and validated t o measure a patient’s current level 
of social functioning.
The PSP consists of 4 items: socially  useful activities (including work and study ), personal 
and social relationships, self- care, and disturbing and aggressive behaviours. The 4 items are 
assessed on a 6 -point scale, from absent to very  severe. Based on these assessments and their 
combination, the global score ranges from 1 to 100.
The PSP can be administered b y an experienced clinician after a short training session.
It takes approximately  5 minute s to administer and score the PSP.
9.2.1.3 Clinical Global Impression Scale -Severity (CGI -S)
The CGI19,20was developed to provide global measures of the severit y of a pat ient’s clinical 
condition during clinical studies. The CGI severity of illness (CGI -S) provides the clinician’s 
impression of the patient’s current state of mental illness. The clinician uses his or her clinical 
experience of this patient population to rat e the severity  of the patient’s current mental illness 
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 53of 92on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal - not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely  ill 
patients). An experienced clinician can use the CGI after a short training session.
It takes 1 to 2 minute s to score the CGI after a clinical interview.
9.2.1.4 Rater Qualification and Certification
The PANSS and the PSP should be administrated by  clinicians (see 9.1.3.2 ). As a pre -
requisite, PANSS raters must be experience din patients with schizophrenia and in 
administering the PANSS. 
The CGI -S must be administered by  the clinician (see 9.1.3.2 )responsible for the patient.  
Any exceptions must be discussed and approved by  Lundbeck.
Only  raters who qualify  on a PANSS rater training and certification programme will be 
authorised to rate the PANSS for the study . Individual scores from the PANSS rater 
qualification session will be used to document the inter- rater reliability  and f iled in the 
Sponsor TMF.
A CGI -S and PSP training sessions will be organised prior to the start of the study .
Documentation of rater training and certification will be delivered to raters for archiving in 
the investigator trial master file (I -TMF). No pati ent must be rated before the documentation 
has been delivered.
New raters joining the study  will be trained and certified using the same certification 
processes.
Rater training and certification will be conducted by  a third part y vendor selected b y the 
sponsor.
Each site should have a minimum of 2certified raters per scale in order to provide back -up 
for each other. Any exceptions must be discussed and approved b y Lundbeck.
To the extent possible , atVisit 12/Primary  Outcome Visit a different rater than th e one doing 
the rating at Visit 6 should assess the patient.
Lundbeck reserves the right to use external quality  oversight methods ( audio and worksheet 
review) may be used to verify  the accuracy  of the PANSS scoring. The process for scale data 
oversight wi ll be outlined in a separate document. Audio monitoring and review will be 
performed on behalf of Lundbeck b y a third part y vendor. The audios will be uploaded to a 
server with limited and controlled access. In agreement with L undbeck, audios will be 
destr oyed at the end of the study . 
The recording equipment will be provided b y a third part y vendor selected by  the sponsor.

(HEA) 
The HEA is a questionnaire aiming at monitoring patients’ healthcare resource utilisation 
such as ph ysicians’ visits, outpatient and inpatient services, medications and relevant services.
The study  personnel who conduct the study  must ask these questions to the patients at 
selected visits. This allows for relating cost data to clinical efficacy  and safet y, and these data 
may be used for cost -effectiveness anal yses. 
The HEA is available in a Baseline Evaluation version, which is to be used at Visit 2, and a 
Follow -up Evaluation version, which is to be used at Vis it 6 and Visit 12.
It takes approximately  10 minutes to complete the HEA.
The HEA will be administered in English only .Country  specific versions will be used for

9.6 Safety Assessments
9.6.1 Adverse Events
The p atients will be asked a non -leading question (for e xample , “how do you feel?” , “how 
have you felt since your last visit?” ) at each visit, starting at the Screening Visit . Adverse 
events (including worsening of concurrent disorders , new disorders , and pregnancies) either 
observed b y the investigator or reported spontaneously  by the patient will be recorded, and 
the investigator will assess the seriousness and the intensity  of the adverse event and its 
relationship to the IMP. Results from relevant tests and examinations, such as clinical safet y 
laboratory  tests, vital signs, and ECGs, or their corresponding conditions will also be recorded 
as adverse events if considered b y the investigator to be clinically  significant.

The investigator must review (initial and date) the results of the clinical safet y laboratory  tests 
as soon as possible after receipt of those results. Out -of-range values must be interpreted by  
the investigator as “not clinically  significant” or “clinically  significant” with a comment 
concerning the planned follow- up. Tests for clinically  significant out -of-range values must be 
repeated, or an appropriate clinica l follow -up must be arranged by  the investigator and 
documented on the laboratory  report, until the value has stabilised or until the value has 
returned to a clinicall y acceptable value (regardless of relationship to I MP). Any  value that is 
out-of- range at the Primary  Outcome or Withdrawal Visit and judged clinically  significant 
must be followed according to accepted medical standards for up to 42 days or until the value 
normalises or stabilises or a diagnosis or reasonable e xplanation has been established. Any 
out-of- range values followed after the last protocol -specified contact with the patient will be 
documented in the patient’s medical record.
The central lab oratory will be notified by  the sponsor when the biological samples may  be 
destroy ed.
Clinically significant out -of-range values must be recorded as an adverse event on an Adverse 
Event Form .
9.6.3 Vital Signs
Pulse rate and b lood pressure will be measured using a standard digital meter . Pulse rate and 
blood pressure will be measured in the following order: supine, sitting, and standing after the 
patient has rested in each position for at least 3 minutes. 
Abnormalities of clinical significance must be recorded as an adverse event on an Adverse 
Event Form .
9.6.4 Weight and Waist Circumference
The p atients will be weighed wearing light clothing and no shoes. A similar amount of 
clothing must be worn on each occasion. The Body  Mass Index (BMI) will be calculated 
automatically  within the eCRF using the height measurement taken at the Screening Visit and 
the body  weig ht taken at Visit 1, 2, 6 and 12 according to the standard formula: weight (in 
kilograms) over height squared (in centimeters).
Waist circumference should be recorded before the patient’s meal and at approximately  the 
same time at each visit. The measureme nt will be made b y locating the upper hip bone and the 
top of the right iliac crest and placing a weighted measuring tape in a horizontal plane around 
the abdomen at the level of the crest. Before reading the tape measure, the assessor should 
ensure that t he tape is snug, but does not compress the skin, and is parallel to the floor.  The 
measurement is to be made at the end of a normal exhalation. Two waist measurements will 
be performed. If the two measurements are differing b y 1 cm or more, a third measur ement 
will be performed. Waist circumference is the average of all the measurements performed.

on a 7- point scale ranging from 1 (extremel y dissatisfied) to 7 (extremel y satisfied). The 
patient can complete the MSQ without any  training.
It takes less than 1 minute to complete the MSQ.
9.7.6 Tolerability and Quality of Life questionnaire (TooL)
The TooL27a patient -rated scale developed to measure the impact of side -effects on the 
quality  of life in patients treated with antips ychotic medication. The Too L consists of eight 
domains: mood (worry -upset), function capabilities, fatigue -weakness, weight gain, stiffness-
tremor, ph ysical restlessness, sexual dy sfunction and dizziness- nausea. Each domain is rated 
on a 4- point scale from 1 (no impact) to 4 (maximum impact). Total scores range from 8 (no 
impact) to 32 (maximum impact).
It takes approximately  5 minutes to complete the TooL .
9.7.6.1 Rater Qualification and Certification
The NSA -4, QLS ,and WoRQ should be rated b y a clinician, as defined above (see 9.1.3.2 ). 
Any exception must be discussed and approved by  Lundbeck. 
A NSA -4, QL S,and WoRQ training session will be organised prior to the start of the study .
Documentation of rater training and certification will be de livered to raters for archiving in 
the I-TMF. No patient should be rated before the documentation has been delivered.
New raters joining the study  will be trained and certified using the same certification 
processes.
Rater training and certification will b e conducted by  a third part y vendor selected b y the 
sponsor.

9.8.1 CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 Genotyping
Blood sampl esfor CYP genot yping analysis will be collected in a EDTA tube (2x2mL ). The 
blood sampling and handling procedures are described in the study -specific Laboratory 
Specification Manual.
Based on in vitro examination of elimination routes for Lu AF35700 , the following genetic 
variation sfor cy tochrome P450 drug metabolising enz ymes will be determined:
•CYP2C19: *1 (WT), *2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *7, *8, *9, *10 and *17
Genoty pe result consists of 2 alleles from the list identified above.
•CYP2D6: *1 (WT), *2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *7, *8, *9, *10, *12, *14, *17, *29 and *41
Genoty pe result consists of 2 alleles from the list identified above. Duplication of an allele 
is reported by adding “XN” to the genot ype result, however the assay does not allow for 
the determination of which allele is du plicated.
If relevant , the genot yping laboratory  must report single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
results, conclu sive genoty pe,and inferred phenoty pefor each sample .
The blood samples will be anal ysed at acentral laboratory using a validated method. The 
samples will be destro yed after they have been analy sed.
The g enotyping results will be used for explorat oryinterpretation of the efficacy  and 
pharmacokinetic results; the genoty ping results are not required at the time of inclusion in the 
study .
The results of the anal ysiswill not be reported back totheinvestigator.
9.9 Exploratory Biomarker Assessments
9.9.1 General Con siderations
Although the possible future exploratory  biomarker anal yses will help to increase our 
understanding of the aetiology  of schizophrenia and TRS and the molecular basis of the drug 
response, the efforts described in this protocol are strictly  research based. Therefore , as the 
complex interactions between genes and disease are currentl y not characterised to a level that 
translates to a meaningful clinical advantage, individual results from the exploratory  
biomarker anal yses will not be given to the patients. For the same reasons, individual results 
will not be added to the patients’ medical records.
The patients will have no direct benefit from the exploratory  biomarker analy ses.
As blood sampling for the exploratory genomics, proteomics, and metabol omics is an integral
part of the stud y, the main Patient Information Sheet covers these anal yses. Conversel y, blood

Page 64of 92sampling for the possible future genetic biomarker anal ysis is optional and a separate Patient 
Information Sheet covers this analy sis.
The b lood samples for possible future explorat orybiomarker anal ysis, or the data derived 
from these blood samples, may  be shared with academic andpublic institutions and other 
companies. However, Lundbeck will retain full control of the samples and their use in 
accordance with the information in the Patient Information Sheet and a Material Transfer 
Agreement . Furthermore, the results based on the anal ysis of the samples may  be pooled 
across studies to increase the statistical power of the anal yses.
A patient a nd/or his or her legal representative (if applicable) may, at an y time and without 
stating a reason, specifically  request the destruction of the patient’s exploratory  biomarker 
sample, irrespective of his or her continued participation in the study . The in vestigator must 
send a written request on behalf of the patient to the international study  manager. The 
investigator will receive written confirmation from L undbeck when the sample has been 
destroy ed.
The blood samples for genomics, proteomics, and metabol omics will be single -coded using 
the patient’s screening number.  The blood samples for genetic biomarker anal ysis will be
double -coded as described in EMA’s position paper on pharmacogenetic terminology43to 
ensure patient privacy  protection.
The results o f the pharmacogenetics, proteomic s/metabolomic sand gene expression profiling 
will not be transferred nor reported.
9.9.2 Blood Sampling for Gene Expression Profiling
Blood samples for gene expression profiling (RNA) will be collected in two PAXgene tubes
(2,5m L) at each time point. The maximum volume of blood to be collected during the stud y 
for this purpose will be 15mL. Samples for gene expression profiling will be shipped toa 
Central Laboratory , United States for sample storage .
The result of the anal ysiswill not be reported back to the investigator.
9.9.3 Blood Sampling for Metabolomic/Proteomic Biomarkers
Blood samples for metabolomic/proteomic biomarkers will be collected in one 10mL  K2 
EDTA tube at each time point . The maximum volume of blood to be collected during the 
study  for this purpose will be 30mL.The samples for metabolomic/proteomic biomarkers 
will be shipped to a Central Laboratory , United States, for sample storage.
The result of the anal ysis will not be reported back to the investigator.

extraction. Blood tubes will be shipped on dry  ice t o a Central Laboratory where DNA will be 
extracted and retained. DNA aliquots will be shipped to a Central Laboratory , for storage. The 
genetic variants to be analy sed may  include single nucleotide poly morphisms (SNPs) and 
copy  number variations (CNVs). The analy tical methods may  be polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) , qPCR (quantitative PCR) , sequencing, or whole genome scans on microarray s.
The results of these anal yses are not specifically related to this study  and will not be relay ed 
back to you or your stu dy doctor. Your sample will be stored at a Central Laboratory ,United 
States, for a maximum of 15 y ears after the overall end -of-the study . At that point it will be 
destroy ed.

report is final . The ISMwill be notified that the samples are to be destro yed, and the 
documentation for sample destruction will be kept in the bioanaly tical study  file.
9.12 Treatment Compliance
The responsible stud y personnel will dispense IMP. Accountability and compliance 
verification should be documented in the patient’s source documents. Patients must be 
counselled on the importance of taking the study medications as directed at all study  visits.
The medical monitor should be contacted if the investigator is uncertain whether a patient’s 
lack of compliance warrants withdrawal from the study .
During Period A, the patient ’s treatment adherence to risperidone or olanzapine will be 
assessed b y analysing the blood levels of r isperidone plus 9- OH-r isperidone or olanzapine.

10Adverse Events
10.1 Definitions
10.1.1 Adverse Event Definitions44
Adverse event –is an y untoward medi cal occurrence in a clinical study  patient administered a 
medicinal product and which does not necessaril y have a causal relationship with this 
treatment.
An adverse event can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign ( including clinically  
signific ant out -of-range values from relevant tests, such as clinical safety laboratory  tests, 
vital signs, ECGs), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal
product , regardless of whether it is considered related to the medicinal produc t.
It is Lundbeck policy  to collect and record all adverse events, including pre-treatment adverse 
events , that is, those that start after the patient has signed the Informed Consent Form and 
prior to the first dose of IMP.
Serious adverse event (SAE) –isany adverse event that:
•results in death
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 67of 92•is life -threatening (this refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might have caused death 
had it been more severe)
•requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation
•results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
•is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
•is medically  important (this refers to an event that may  not be immediatel y life-threatening 
or result in death or hospitalisation, but may  jeopardise the patient or may  require 
intervention to prevent any  of the SAEs defined above)
Examples of medically  important events are intensive treatment for allergic bronchospasm ;
blood dy scrasia or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation; or development of drug 
dependency ordrug abuse.
Planned hospitalisations or surgical interventions for a condition that existed before the 
patient signed the Informed Consent Form and that did not change in intensity  are not SAEs. 
Emergency  room visits that do not result in admission to the hospital are not necessarily  
SAEs; however, they  must be evaluated to determine whether they  meet any  of the SAE 
definitions (for example, life -threatening or other serious [medically  important] event).
Planned support hospitalisation (in the opinion of the investigator) of outpatients, or 
prolongation of hospitalisation of inpatients after having signed Inform edConsent Form are 
not to be reported as SAEs. Adverse ev ents occurring during a planned support hospitalisation 
of outpatients or during a prolongation of hospitalisation of inpatients are not to be reported as 
SAEs unless the AE fulfils other seriousness criteria than the hospitalisation. Sy mptoms 
which are ex pected as part of underl ying disease should not be reported as AEs unless the 
symptoms increase in intensity  or frequency .
In addition, in the following situations, the investigator has to consider reporting the outcome 
of the C -SSRSTMat any  visit (starti ng with the Visit 2) as an SAE, if:
•the C -SSRSTMreport indicates a suicidal ideation score of 4 or 5, respectively, or
•the patient answers “Yes” on a ny of the 5 C -SSRSTMsuicidal behaviour items (actual 
attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, prepa ratory  acts, or behaviour) .
Moreover, if the patient, in the opinion of the investigator, is at significant risk of suicide, 
whether fulfilling the C -SSRSTMcriteria or not, this should also be reported as an SAE.
Non-serious adverse event –is any  adver se event that does not meet the definition of an SAE.
If there is an y doubt as to whether an adverse event meets the definition of an SAE, a 
conservative viewpoint must be taken, and the adverse event must be reported as an SAE.
Suspected unexpected seriou s adverse reaction (SUSAR) – is any  adverse event that is 
assessed as serious, unexpected (its nature or intensity  is not consistent with the current 
version of the Investigator’s Brochure4or the UKSummary of Product Characteristics for 
risperidone9and olanzapine ,10and related to an investigational product b y either the 
investigator or the sponsor.
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 68of 92Overdose –is a dose taken by  a patient that exceeds the dose prescribed to that patient. Any  
overdose (and associated sy mptoms) must , at a minimum, be recorded as a non -serious 
adverse event .
10.1.2 Adverse Event Assessment Definitions
Assessment of Intensity
The investigator must assess the intensity of theadverse event using the following definitions, 
and record it on the Adverse Event Form :
•Mild –the adverse event causes minimal discomfort and does not interfere in a significant 
manner with the patient’s normal activities.
•Moderate – the adverse event is sufficiently  uncomfortable to produce some impairment of 
the patient’s normal activities.
•Severe –the adverse event is incapacitating , preventing the pa tient from participating in his 
or hernormal activities.
Assessment of Causality
The investigator must assess the causal relationship between theadverse event and the IMP 
using the following definitions, and record it on the Adverse Event Form and the Serious 
Adverse Event Form (if applicable):
•Probable –the adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to the IMP or recurs on 
rechallenge, and another aetiology  is unlikel y or significantly less likel y.
•Possible –the adverse event has a suggestive temporal relationship to the IMP, and an 
alternative aetiology  is equally  or less likel y.
•Not related –the adverse event has no temporal relationship to the I MP or is due to 
underly ing/concurrent illness or effect of another drug (that is, there is no causal 
relationship between the IMP and the adverse event ).
An adverse event is considered causall y related to the use of the IMP when the causalit y 
assessment is probable or possible .
For pre -treatment adverse events, a causalit y assessment is not relevant.
Assessment of Outcome
The investigator must assess the outcome of theadver se event using the following definitions, 
and record it on the Adverse Event Form and the Serious Adverse Event Form (if applicable):
•Recovered – the patient has recovered completel y, and no symptoms remain.
•Recovering –the patient’s condition is improving, but sy mptoms still remain.
•Recovered with sequelae –the patient has recovered, but some sy mptoms remain (for 
example, the patient had a stroke and is functioning normall y, but has some motor 
impairment).
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 69of 92•Not recovered – the patient’s condition has not improved and the s ymptoms are unchanged 
(for example, an atrial fibrillation has become chronic).
•Death
10.2 Pregnancy
Although not necessarily considered an adverse event, apregnancy  in a patient in the study  
must be recorded on an Adverse Event Form , as well as on a Pregnancy Form (paper), even if 
no adverse event associated with the pregnancy  has occurred. Pregnancies must be reported to 
Lundbeck using the same expedited reporting timelines as those for SAEs. If the patient 
becomes pregnant, the patient must be withdrawn from the study.
An uncomplicated pregnancy  should not be considered an SAE. If, however, thepregnancy  is 
associated with an SAE, the appropriate serious criterion (for example, hospitalisation) must 
be indicated on the Serious Adverse Event Form . Examples of pregnancies to be reported as 
SAEs (medicall y important) are spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and malformations.
The investigator must follow up on the outcome of the pregnancy  and report it on a 
Pregnancy Form (paper).  The follow-up must include information on the neonate at least up 
until the age of 1 month.
If the partner of a ma nparticipat ingin the study  becomes pregnant, the outcome of the 
pregnancy  should be followed if the partner agrees.  The partner must sign an Informed 
Consent Form to allow the investigator to collect information to report to Lundbeck .
10.3 Recording Adverse Events
Adverse events (including pre -treatment adverse events) must be recorded on an Adverse 
Event Form . The investigator must provide information on the a dverse event , preferabl y with 
a diagnosis, or at least with signs and s ymptoms; start and stop dates (and start and stop time 
if the adverse event lasts less than 24 hours) ; intensity ; causal relationship to I MP; action 
taken; and outcome. If the adverse e vent is an overdose, the nature of the overdose must be 
stated (for example, medication error, accidental overdose, or intentional overdose). If the 
intensity  changes during the course of the adverse event, this must be recorded on the AE 
Intensity Log .
Ifthe adverse event is serious, this must be indicated on the Adverse Event Form . 
Furthermore, the investigator must fill out a Serious Adverse Event Form and report the SAE 
to Lundbeck immediately  (within 24 hours) after becoming aware of it (section 10.4).
Adverse events , including clinically  significant out-of- range clinical safet y laboratory test
values and findings from for example, ECGs, must be recorded individuall y, except when 
considered manifestations of the same medical condition or disease state; in such cases, they  
must be recorded under a single diagnosis.

Confidential
Page 70of 9210.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Events
The investigator must report SAEs to L undbeck immediately  (within 24 hours) after 
becoming aware of them by  comple ting a Serious Adverse Event Form .
The initial report must contain as much information as possible and, if more information 
about the patient’s condition becomes available, the Serious Adverse Event Form must be 
updated with the additional information.
If the investigator cannot report the SAE in Rave®, then he or she must complete and sign the 
Serious Adverse Event Fallback Form and send it to:
Global Pharmacovigilance (GPV)
Fax: +45 36 30 99 67
e-mail: safet y@lundbeck.com
Lundbeck will assume responsibili ty for reporting SUSARs to the authorities in accordance 
with local regulations. In those Member States of the European Union that have implemented 
the European Union Clinical Trials Directive45and in Norway , Liechtenstein, and Iceland, 
that is, in the countries where unblinded expedited safet y reporting is required, Lundbeck will 
also assume responsibility for reporting SUSARs to the ethics committees.
Lundbeck will assess the expectedness of SAEs and inform the investigator(s) about 
SUSARs, at a minimum, in the blinded SUSAR listings. CIOMS -I reports for SUSARS are 
not normally  distributed to investigators in those countries where SUSAR listings are 
sufficient. However, if the CIOMS -I reports are required (for example, by the local 
EC/I RB/REB), they  will b e sent to the investigator.
10.5 Treatment and Follow -up of Adverse Events
Patients with adverse events must be treated in accord ance with usual clinical practice at the 
discretion of the investigator.
Non-serious adverse events must be followed up until resolu tion or the safety  follow -up 
assessment, whichever comes first. At the safety follow -up, information on new SAEs , if an y, 
and stop dates for previously  reported adverse events must be recorded.
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to follow up on a ll SAEs until the patient has 
recovered, stabilised, or recovered with sequelae, and to report to Lundbeck all relevant new 
information using the same procedures and timelines as those for the initial report. Relevant 
information includes discharge summari es, autopsy  reports, and medical consultations.
SAEs that are spontaneously  reported b y a patient to the investigator after the safet y follow -
up assessment must be handled in the same manner as SAEs that occur during the stud y. 
These SAEs will be captured in the GPV database.
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 71of 92Patients with clinically  significant out-of- range clinical safet y laboratory  test values at the 
Primary  Outcome or Withdrawal Visit must be followed in accordance with usual clinical 
practice and be scheduled for a Safet y Follow -up Vis it to allow for a medical examination 
and/or blood sampling (see section 8.5).
Patients who withdr aw due to elevated AST or ALT values (see section 5.4) must be followed 
until the values normalise or stabilise or a diagnosis or a reasonable explanation has been 
established. Additional medical examinations (for example, ultrasound scanning and/or 
sampling for serology , conjugated bilirubin, INR) should be considered. A gastroenterology  
or hepatology  consultation should also be considered.
11Data Handling and Record Keeping
11.1 Data Collection
11.1.1 Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs)
eCRF swill be used to collect all the data related to the study , except the external data 
described in section 11.1.3 .
The eCRFs use third party  software (Rave®) to capture data via an on -line sy stem on a 
computer. Data related to the study  will be recorded electronically  in a central database over 
encry pted lines, and all entries and modifications to the data will be logged in an audit trail. 
Access to the s ystem will only  be granted after appropriate and documented training. Written 
instructions for using the sy stem will be provided along with the training.
Electronic signatures will be used where signatures are required on pages and/or visits. 
Automated data inclusion checks will be implemented where appropriate; other data will be 
reviewed and evaluated for accuracy  by the CRA. All entries, corrections, and changes must 
be made b y the investigator or adelegate .
11.1.2 Patient Binders
11.1.2.1 Use of Patient Binders
Lundbeck will provide a Patient Binder for each patient.  The Patient Binder contain s
different ty pes of source documents, organised by  visit and ty pe. A ballpoint pen with 
waterproof ink must be used to enter information in the Patient Binder .
11.1.2.2 Rating Scales and Patient -reported Outcomes (PROs)
ThePatient Binder contain spaper versions of the rating scales and PROs. They  will be 
completed b y the rater(s) and pat ient,respectivel y. The data will be transcribed to the Scoring 
Sheets in the eCRF b y the investigator or a delegate.
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 72of 92The rater (s)must verify  that all the entries in the Scale Section are accurate and correct by  
signing and dating the relevant pages.
The patients will be asked to comp lete the PROs in their local language. The patients’ 
responses may only be corrected by the patient .
11.1.2.3 Serious Adverse Event Fallback Forms
Serious Adverse Event F allback Formsmust be used when the eCRF cannot be accessed.
11.1.3 External Data
All electronic data will be transferred using a secure method accepted b y Lundbeck.
The electronic data received from the following vendors will be kept in a secure designated 
storage area outside the eCRF :
•The clinical safet y laboratory test r esults will be transferred b ycentral laboratory .
•Risperidone (including 9 -OH-risperidone) and olanzapine PK results will be transferred b y 
central laborator y.
•The ECG results will be transferred b y central ECG service provider
•If any electronic assessment tools ( ie MI NI,PANSS, CGI -S, PSP, mSAS, AIMS, BARS, 
NSA -4, QL S, WoRQ , C-SSRS ) and/or patient reported outcomes (SWN -S, TooL , MSQ 
and HEA) will be used, the results will be transferred b y the designated vendor.    
11.2 Retention of Study Documents at the Site
11.2.1 eCRF Data
If a site close sbefore the study has been completed, the investigator will continue to have 
read-only access to the eCRF. If a site closes after the study  has been completed , the 
investigator will no longer have read access to the eCRF. Instead, each site will be provided 
with a CD -ROM containing the data related to the site (including eCRF data, queries, and the 
audit trail). As a CD -ROM is not considered a durable medium and may  therefore not be 
readable for the full retention period (for examp le, 15 y ears [if required by  the applicable 
regulatory  requirements]), it is possible for the investigator to request a new CD -ROM with 
the data related to the site.
11.2.2 Other Study Documents
The investigator must keep the investigator’s set of documents in th e investigator TMF for at 
least 15 y ears after the C linical Study R eport has been approved or in accordance with 
national requirements, whichever is longer .
If off-sitestorage is used, a study -specific binder will remain at the site after the other study -
specific documents have been shipped for off -site storage . This binder is considered part of 
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 73of 92the investigator TMF and must be kept in a secure place b y the site for the required period of 
time. The binder must contain, at a minimum, the following documents : a copy  of the
Investigator TMF Inde x,a certified cop y of the Patient Identification Code List , a blank
Financial Disclosure Form and a Retrieval Form .
If on -site storage is used, it must be included in the site's clinical trial agreement and the 
storage facility  must meet L undbeck requirements for onsite archival of the investigator TMF.
Lundbeck will notify  the investigator in writing when the required storage period has expired 
and when the documents may  be destroy ed according to regulations.
12Monitorin g Procedures
Prior to including patients in the study , the investigator must sign a source data agreement that 
identifies the source documents (original documents, data, and records) at the site. The 
document will also list which data may  be recorded direc tly on the eCRFs or an y eCOA
Only  patients with schizophrenia that are resistant to treatment (TRS) can be enrolled in this 
study . The main criterion to define TRS is a failure to respond to two antipsy chotic treatment 
trials of adequate dose and duration. For the purpose of this study  the first treatment failure 
will be documented retrospectivel y when a patient fails to respond to at least one 
antipsy chotic treatment trial of at least 6 weeks duration, any time in the past 2 y ears prior to 
Screening as desc ribed in I nclusion Criterion 8 (retrospective documentation). Furthermore, 
the failure to respond to the current antips ychotic treatment trial may be considered a 
retrospective failed treatment in compliance with Inclusion Criterion 8, if documented to be of 
adequate dose and duration.46Documentation of the second failed antipsy chotic treatment 
trial will take place during the 6 weeks of Period A of the study  (prospective confirmation).
The patient’s medical records is the most comprehensive source to docum ent antipsy chotic 
treatment failure. Thus, it is required that the investigator attempts to obtain copies of 
previous medical records of psy chiatric and general medical history  for every  patient. In case 
the investigator does not have medical records for a patient at his/her own clinic, the 
investigator should attempt to obtain copies/written summary  of relevant medical records 
from the previous treating ph ysician. If original medical records are unavailable, an y properl y 
documented communication with the t reating ph ysician, letters, written summaries, 
photocopies of medical records, pharmacy  records and specific letter templates may  be used 
to document at least one previous treatment failure, including the current antipsy chotic 
treatment trial.
If the previ ous treating phy sician is no longer practicing and/or medical documentation has 
been destro yed as per local laws on archiving or by  natural disaster, information from famil y 
members, caregivers or other persons close to the patient may  help substantiating previous 
psychiatric history . Pharmacy  records can be used to support the documentation of the dose 
and duration of treatment with a prescribed medication.
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 74of 92The investigator is advised to contact the study  clinical surveillance team to discuss the cases 
with unavailable documentation.
If there is no acceptable reason for not obtaining documentation of previous medical history  
and/or attempts are not documented in the sour ce documents, the patient should be considered 
not eligible for the study . In cases whe re sites do not document their effort to obtain the 
medical history, do not document summaries from previous treating phy sician or other 
sources , or do not document the reason the records are not available and there is no clear 
evidence that the patient is eligible, this will be considered an important protocol deviation.
To help in the assessment of eligibility  and for documentation purposes, sites should prepare a 
Psychiatric History  of the patient, including the information on failed antipsy chotic treatm ent 
trials in the last two y ears gathered from all available sources. This brief Psy chiatric History  
should be included in the Psy chiatric Intake Note prepared for the Eligibility Review 
performed by the study clinical surveillance team.
The Informed Conse nt Form includes a statement whereb y the patient agrees to the 
investigator communicating with their regular doctor of their participation in the study . If the 
patient does not want his/her regular doctor to be contacted and there is no other way  to verify
or establish that the patient qualifies for the stud y, the patient should not be enrolled.
During the study , the CRA will visit the site to ensure that the protocol is being adhered to
andthat all issues are being recorded, to perform source data verific ation, and to monitor IMP
accountabilit y. The visit intervals will depend on the outcome of the remote monitoring of the 
eCRFs, the site ’s recruitment rate ,and the compliance of the site to the protocol and Good 
Clinical Practice .  In addition, the CRA wi ll be available for discussions b y telephone.
Source data verification requires that the CRA be given direct access to all the source 
documents . Direct access includes permission to examine, analy se,and verify  any records and 
reports that are important for the evaluation of the study .
13Audits and Inspection s
Authorised personnel from Global Clinical Quality  Assurance at Lundbeck and quality  
assurance personnel from business partners may  audit the study  at an y time to assess 
compliance with the protocol and the principles of Good Clinical Practice and all other 
relevant regulations.
The patients must be informed that authorised personnel from Lundbeck may wish to review
their medical records. The investigator must be aware and the patients must be informed th at

Page 79of 9217.9 Efficacy Analyses
17.9.1 General Efficacy Analysis Methodology
The efficacy  anal yses will be based on the FAS. A significance level of 0.05 is used unless 
otherwise indicated. For all endpoints, the effects of the two doses of Lu AF35700 will be 
evaluated b y testing the null hypothesis of no difference to the active control for each dose. 
17.9.2 Analysis of the Primary Endpoint
Changes from Baseline 2 (Week 6) in total PANSS score at Weeks 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16, 
will be anal ysed using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML )-based mixed model for 
repeated measures (MMRM) approach. All patients in the FAS will be included with their 
observed data in Period B. Data retrieved at Week 16 from withdrawals will not be included 
in the primary  anal ysis.
The model will include the fixed, categorical ef fects of treatment (two doses of Lu AF35700 
and active control), country , visit, treatment -by-visit interaction, Period -A-therapy  
(risperidone/olanzapine), Period-A- therapy -by-visit interaction as well as the continuous, 
fixed covariates of baseline score and baseline score -by-visit interaction. An unstructured 
(co)variance structure will be used to model the within -patient errors. If, unexpectedly , this 
analysis fails to converge, the following structures will be applied, in the following order : 
first-order ante -dependence, heterogeneous compound sy mmetry , compound sy mmetry .The 
Kenward -Roger approximation will be used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom. 
The primary  comparisons will be the contrasts between each dose and control at the Week 16 
Visit based on the least squares means for the treatment- by-visit interaction effect. The 
estimated mean difference between each dose and control based on this model will be 
reported with two- sided sy mmetric 95% confidence intervals and corresponding p -values.
17.9.3 Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary Endpoint
Some level of data missingness is expected, and the primary  anal ysis (MMRM) is valid under 
the assumption that the data is Missing at Random (MAR). Simulation studies do suggest that 
MMRM is robust to accommod ate some level of data Missing Not at Random. Since it is 
unclear how the level of missingness of this ty pe of data will influce the outcome at this stage, 
choosing a pre -specified primary  anal ysis valid under MNAR accuratel y will be very  
difficult. 
As such, sensitivity  anal yses valid under relevant cases of data MNAR will be performed. In 
particular, pattern -mixture models will be used. Different delta (imputation of how much 
worse response patients who withdraw would have compared to those who complete the 
treatment period and who have the same profile up to time to withdrawal) will be applied as 
described b y C. H. Mallinckrodt, Q. Lin, and G. Molenberghs .47

Page 80of 92MMRM model as the primary  anal ysis, including the retrieved data for withdrawals , will be 
performed . 
The sensitivity  analy ses described above will be further specified in more detail in the 
statistical analy sis plan (SAP).
17.9.4 Test ingStrategy for Primary Endpoint
Hochberg’s procedure will be used to control for multiplicity .
17.9.5 Analysis of the Secondary Endp oints
ForCGI-S and PSP, the same methodology  as that described for the primary  endpoint will be 
used.
The proportion of patients responding at Week 16will be compared for each dose versus 
control using logistic regression with Period A therap y, country and treatment as factors. The 
analysis will be done for observed cases without imputation as well as for the whole FAS, 
imputing non -response for all patients withdrawn prior to Week 16.
Additional responder analy ses using alternative cut -points of the pr imary  endpoint may  be 
used to present the efficacy  as measured by  changes from Baseline 2 in PANSS total score .
17.9.6 Analysis of theExploratory Endpoints
For NSA- 4, SWN -S, MSQ, TooL , QLS score sand WoRQ the same methodology  as that 
described for the primary en dpoint will be used to anal yse changes from Baseline 2 of total 
scores at Weeks 10 and 16.
17.9.7 Analysis of Subgroups
The anal ysis of the primary  endpoint will be repeated by excluding patients with extremely  
low drug plasma concentrations (Lu AF35700/olanzapine/risperidone/ 9 -hydroxy -risperidone) 
in Period B (Weeks 8, 10, and 16). Two anal yses will be performed:
1.Include patients with values >LLOQ at Weeks 8, 10, and 16
2. S election of patients based on population pharmacokinetic anal ysis. This analy sis will be 
reported separately
17.9.8 Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Plasma concentrations of L u AF35700 and its metabolite and CYP genoty pewill be 
summarised using des criptive statistics .

If deemed appropriate, the relationship between exposure and the primary  efficacy  endpoint 
might be investigated using a populatio n pharmacokinetic/pharmacod ynamic approach.
17.10 Safety Analys es
17.10.1 Analysis of Adverse Events
Adverse events will be classified according to the time of onset of the adverse event:
•pre-treatment adverse event –an adverse event that starts onor after the date th e patient 
signed the Informed Consent Form and prior to the date of first dose of IMP
•treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) –an adverse event that starts or increases in 
intensity  on or after the date of first dose of IMP
Adverse events, sorted by  system organ class (SOC) and preferred term, will be summarised 
by randomised treatment group for the APTS .
Allocation of TEAEs to Treatment Periods
TEAEs may  be allocat ed into study  periods (these will be defined in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan ).
17.10.2 Analysis of Other Safety Endpoints
Clinical safet y laboratory tests, vital signs, weight/BMI, ECG parameters, and C -SSRS scores 
will be summarised by randomised treatment group using descriptive statistics. Potentially  
clinically  significant (PCS) values will be flagged and summarised.
The changes from Baseline 2 in mSAS , AIMS,and BARS scores at Weeks 10 and 16 will be 
analysed using an MMRM model as described for the primary  endpoint .
The CYP genot ype will be listed.
Allsafet y anal yses will be based on the APTS.
17.11 Pharmacoeconomic Analyses
All pharmacoeconomic variables collected in the HEA will be summarised using descriptive 
statistics by  treatment group and visit.

No inte rim anal yses are planned .
17.13 Sample Size and Power
A total of n=180 patients per group is needed in Period B to have 90% power for at least one 
Lu AF35700 dose to show a significant improvement on change in PANSS total score over 
the active control, assuming :
•a standard deviation (SD) of 20 
•a mean improvement in PANSS total score of 5.25 and 7 for t he 2 doses (standardised 
effect size 0.26 and 0.35) and 
•use of Hochberg’s procedure for multiplicity  adjustment at 5% level of significance.
Assuming further an information loss of ~20% due to dropout in Period B, n=225 (=180/0.8) 
must be randomise d, a total of 675 patients. 
With an attrition rate of ~30% in Period A, approximately  964 (=675/0.7) patients are
expected to be enrolle d to meet the target of randomis ing 675 patients in Period B.
A blinded re -assessment of sample size will be considered if the blinded SD estimate or the 
dropout rate deviates from the assumptions. This re -assessment will be performed when 50% 
of the patients have completed the treatment period. A maximum of 300 random ised patients 
per treatment arm will be allowed in the study . The pooled standard deviation will be 
estimated from the Covariance Parameter Estimates from an MMRM model identical to the 
one to be used for the primary  anal ysis, except without the effect of treatment, i.e. the 
following:
The model will include the fixed, categorical effects of country , visit, Period-A- therapy  
(risperidone/olanzapine), Period -A-therapy -by-visit interaction as well as the continuous, 
fixed covari ates of baseline score and baseline score -by-visit interaction. An unstructured 
(co)variance structure will be used to model the within -patient errors.

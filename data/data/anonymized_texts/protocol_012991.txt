The Medicines Company   Final 17  March 2016 Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration:  
The investigational drug oritavancin diphosphate  (oritavancin) will be administered intravenously to all subjects . 
The dose is made up of three  single -use vial s, each  contain ing 400 mg of oritavancin  and the inactive 
component mannitol . At the time of use, each vial should be reconstituted by adding 40 mL of Sterile Water for 
Injection, United States Pharmacopeia (USP). After reconstitution, oritavancin should be further diluted in 
approximately 1000 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection (D5W).  
On Day 1 of the study, subjects  will be administered a single 1200  mg IV dose of oritavancin in 1000 mL D5W. 
Oritavancin  must be infused over 3 hours.  No other material or diluent may be substituted or concomitantly 
infused through the same IV line.  
Duration of Treatment : Intravenous oritavancin will be administered in a single 1200mg intravenous dose.  
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration: Not applicable.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Primary outcome:  
 Safety of the administration of oritavancin in subjects on chronic warfarin will be assessed according to 
vital signs, laboratory abnormalities, and the incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse 
Events (SAEs)  
Additional Safety Evaluation:  
Any changes in warfarin dosing  (for patients on warfarin therapy) , based on the PT/INR results or safety data 
will be recorded . If the PT/INR has not returned to therapeutic baseline by Day 14, patient will be referred to 
and followed by their primary  physician responsible for their PT/INR monitoring . 
Secondary outcomes:  
 Clinical cure as an assessment of efficacy, determined by the investigator at 48-72 hours after start of 
oritavancin dose  and at Day 7 
Exploratory  Outcome : 
 Potential for a ntibody development following a single dose oritavancin  administration  
Clinical evaluation time points:  
 Assessment of safety (adverse events and PT/INR  testing ) Days 1,  2, 3, 7 and 14  
 Early clinical efficacy evaluation at 48 to 72 hours from start of oritavancin administration  
 Post-therapy efficacy evaluation  at Day 7   
Statistical Methods: Approximately 25 subjects  on chronic warfarin therapy will be enrolled  (ITT population) .  
An additional group of 1 5 ABSSSI patients , who are not on chronic warfarin therapy , will also be enrolled.  
Sample size:  The sample size of 25 subjects  is chosen based on feasibility and clinical judgment to provide 
adequate safety information on the administration of oritavancin to subjects  with an ABSSSI who are on chronic 
warfarin.  An additional group of 15 ABSSSI patien ts who are not on chronic warfarin therapy was added to 
obtain information regarding potential for antibody production related to oritavancin administration.  
Analysis population : The patient populations are defined as follows:  
 Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Popula tion: The ITT population will include all subjects  screened and enrolled  
 Safety Population: All subjects  dosed with IV oritavancin. The safety population will be the primary 
population for all the safety analyses  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for  demographic, baseline characteristics, medical history, prior and 
concomitant medications.  Descriptive statistics include means, medians, standard deviations and ranges for 
continuous variables, as well as frequency and percentage for categorical variabl es.

1 If subject has abnormal laboratory values that have not returned to a therapeutic baseline by Day 14 , additional follow up visits may be required.  
2 Vitals signs include blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate and heart rate.  
3 Perform a local urine pregnancy test for female patients of childbearing potential (may be omitted for females > 2 years post menopausal or surgically sterile).  
4 This includes but is not limited to aspiration, debridement, incision and drainage.  
5 Blood c hemistry and hematology ( Section 7.2.4  for listing of tests to be performed). Unless otherwise indicated all laboratory tests will be performed by site’s local labo ratory.  
6 Microbiology testing should be performed per institutions Standard of Care (SOC).  
7 Patient s on warfarin are  required to have at least one documented INR between 1.5 and 3.0 in the 30 days prior to screening.  The INR value at Screening must fall within 1.5 and 3.0.  After dosing 
with oritavancin, the next PT/INR should be collected w ith 18 -36 hours of start of oritavancin infusion. If PT/INR has not returned to baseline at Day 3, more frequent PT/INR testing prio r to Day 7 may 
be required.  
8 Clinical cure should be assessed by investigator at Day 3 (48 -72 hours after start of oritava ncin administration) and at Day 7.  
9 Patients with a negative Coombs Test at Day 14  test must  have test  repeated every 2 weeks until return to baseline  or stable . 
10 Adverse events and serious adverse events will be assessed from the time of informed consent through 14 days post first administration of Oritavancin.    
11 Blood will be collected immediately after the completion of the infusion to prepare three plasma sample for Ex Vivo Study inv estigating the effects of Oritavancin on Antibody Formation.

The Medicines Company   Final 17  March 2016 1. INTRODUCTION  
This protocol describes a  multicenter, open -label study to evaluate the  safety of a single 1200 
mg IV d ose of Orbactiv (oritavancin) for the treatment of subjects  on concomitant chronic 
warfarin therapy being treated for an acute bacterial skin and skin st ructure infection  
(ABSSSI) .  An additional group  of fifteen patients will also be enrolled that are being treated 
for an ABSSSI and are NOT  on concomitant chronic warfarin therapy.  
Oritava ncin has been approved in the United States for the treatment of adu lt patients with 
acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) caused or suspected to be caused 
by susceptible isolates of designated Gram -positive microorganisms. An extensive clinical 
development program has been conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 
oritavancin, comprising 4 Phase III studies, 4 Phase II  studies  and 15 Phase I  studies  completed  
in adults . A safety and pharmacokinetic study in the pediatric population  is ongoing .  A total of 
3042 subjects have been exposed t o oritavancin to date, including  1075 adult subjects with 
ABSSSI treated with a 1200 mg single dose regimen.  
1.1. BACKGROUND  
ABSSSI s are common infections that include cellulitis, major cutaneous abscesses, and 
wound infections. ABSSSIs are inflammatory microb ial invasions of the epidermis, 
dermis and subcutaneous tissues [ Dryden, 2009 ]. These infections are frequently 
caused by Gram -positive bacteria including methicillin -susceptible S. aureus , 
methicillin -resistant S. aureus (MRSA) , Streptococcus pyogenes , and other β -hemolytic 
streptococcal species and enterococci.  The clinical complications of improperly treated 
or untreated ABSSSIs may include local expansion and spread, secondary bacteremia 
with potential for distant metastatic foci of infection, and sy stemic effects of bacterial 
infection.  
1.2. ORITAVANCIN  
Oritavancin is a novel semi -synthetic, lipoglycopeptide antibiotic that has three 
mechanisms of action : 1) inhibition of the transglycosylation (polymerization) step of 
cell wall biosynthesis by binding to  the stem peptide of peptidoglycan precursors; 2) 
inhibition of the transpeptidation (crosslinking) step of cell wall biosynthesis by 
binding to the peptide bridging segments of the cell wall; and 3) disruption of bacterial 
membrane integrity, leading to d epolarization, permeabilization, and rapid cell death. 
These multiple mechanisms contribute to the rapid, concentration -dependent 
bactericidal activity of oritavancin.  
Oritavancin has been approved  by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for the 
treatmen t of adult subjects with ABSSSIs  caused or suspected to be caused by 
susceptible isolates of designated Gram -positive microorganisms including methicillin 
resistant Staphylococcus aureus  [ORBACTIV™ Package Insert 201 4].

The Medicines Company   Final 17  March 2016 1.2.1.  Preclinical Studies  
Oritavancin has been extensively studied pre -clinically. The results from the 
safety, toxicology, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic studies demonstrate 
that oritavancin does not induce any biologically significant toxicity .  An 
overview of relevant nonc linical study results  is presented in the Investigator’s 
Brochure [ Oritavancin Investigator’s Brochure  Version 10].   
1.2.2.  Summary of Clinical Pharmacology  
The pharmacokinetics of a single 1200 mg dose of oritavancin in ABSSSI 
subjects were determined from pop ulation pharmacokinetic analysis of pooled 
data from 297 adult subjects and are presented in Table  2. At steady state, 
oritavancin exhibits linear pharmacokinetics at a dose up to 1200 mg. The 
mean, population -predicted oritavancin concentration -time profile displays a 
multi - exponential decline and a long terminal half -life of 245 hours.  Normal 
Healthy Volunteers administered a single 1200 mg dose of oritavancin 
experience higher oritavancin exposure when compared to pat ients; mean C max 
was approximately 25% higher in healthy volunteers and AUC 0-∞ was 
approximately 40% higher in healthy volunteers when compared to patients.

1.2.3.  Clinical Studies  
The clinical program of oritavancin comprises  four completed Phase  III studies, 
four Phase  II studies, fourteen  Phase  I studies in h ealthy subjects, and 
one Phase  I study in both healthy and hepatically -impaired subjects. Throughout 
the completed studies, IV oritavancin was administered to 3042 individuals 
(2632 subjects and 410 healt hy subjects)  [Oritavancin Investigator’s Brochure  
Version 10].

The Medicines Company   Final 17  March 2016 Efficacy and safety findings of the intended treatment dose in adult subjects 
with ABSSSI are summarized below:  
Efficacy  
The results from SOLO I and SOLO II in 1959 adult patients demonstrate that a 
single 1200 mg IV dose of oritavancin is clinically non -inferior to 7 to 10 days 
of IV vancomycin (1 g or 15 mg/kg twice daily) using a pre -specified non -
inferiority margin of 10% for both early clinical response and clinical cure at 
post therapy ev aluation . The subject population was representative of ABSSSIs 
with S. aureus  the common causative pathogen isolated; a large subset of 
subjects (N=405) had documented MRSA infections. Efficacy in MRSA 
subjects was similar to that observed in the overall population for all endpoints.  
Safety  
The SOLO I and SOLO II studies demonstrat ed that a single 1200  mg IV dose 
of oritavancin is well tolerated and has a similar safety profile to 7 to 10  days of 
IV vancomycin treatment as demonstrated  by the similar  frequency and nature 
of treatment emergent adverse events, S erious Adverse Events ( SAE s) and 
Adverse Events (AE s) leading to discontinuation reported by patients  (Table 3).

1.2.4.  Known and Potential Risks and Benefits  
Twenty three clini cal trials, including four Phase III , four Phase II , and fifteen  
Phase I studies have been completed to date , in which  3042 subjects  were 
exposed to oritavancin.  The most common adverse events (>3%) by preferred 
term in either treatment group, in the SOLO I or SOLO II studies were nausea, 
headache, vomiting, cellulitis, diarrh ea, constipation, infusion site extravasation, 
pyrexia and pruritus, as outlined in Table 4.  
Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of 
oritavancin . If an acute hypersensitivity reaction occurs during oritavancin  
infusion, disco ntinue oritavan cin immediately and institute appropriate 
supportive care. Due to the possibility of cross -sensitivity, carefully monitor for 
signs of hypersensitivity during ORBACTIV infusion in patients with a history 
of glycopeptide allergy. In the Phase  III ABSSSI clinical trials, the median 
onset of hypersensitivity reactions in oritavancin -treated patients was 1.2 days 
and the median duration of these reactions was 2.4 days.    
Infusion related reactions or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported w ith 
oritavancin including pruritus, urticaria or flushing. If reactions do occur, 
slowing or interrupting the infusion should be considered to mitigate the 
reaction.  
Oritavancin is a mild inhibitor of Cytochrome P450 2C9 enzyme ( CYP2C9 ), 
and therefore, has the potential to increase warfarin concentrations when 
administered concomitantly.  Oritavancin has been shown to artificially prolong 
PT and INR for up to 24 hours, making the monitoring of the anticoagulation 
effect of warfarin unr eliable up to 24 hours after an oritav ancin dose. Subjects 
Oritavancin diphosphate  Clinic al Study Protocol MDCO -ORI-14-03 Amendment 2 
Confidential  Page 18 
The Medicines Company   Final 17  March 2016 who are on warfarin (including all subjects in this trial) should be closely 
monitored for signs of bleeding . 
A complete description of relevant risks of oritavancin can be found in the 
investigator’s brochure [ Oritavancin Investigator’s Brochure  Version 10] and 
the United States Package Insert ( USPI ). 
1.3. STUDY RATIONALE  
As noted above , oritavancin is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 based on a 31% increase 
(90% confidence interval ( CI) [1.294, 1. 345]) in the systemic exposure of S warfarin  
(TMC -ORI-12-03). Two additional studies are ongo ing; MDCO -ORI-14-01 is a Phase I  
study in healthy volunteers to assess the magnitude and duration of the effect of a single 
1200 mg intravenous dose on numerous coagulation tests, including PT/INR, and 
MDCO -ORI-14-02 which is an additional Phase I  study in healthy volunteers assessing 
the magnitude and duration of the  pharmacokinetic  (PK) interaction between warfarin 
and oritavancin . Since warfarin is a drug with a narrow therapeutic index and some 
patients with ABSSSI may receive  oritavancin while on warfarin treatment, this study  
is being conducted to characterize the effect of oritavancin on clinical care and warfarin 
dosing.  The intention is to det ermine the magnitude and duration, if any, of alterations 
to warfarin dosing or of clinically important consequences of dosing with oritavancin . 
In the SOLO and SIMPLIFI trials, a total of 16 patients with ABSSSI received 
concomitant warfarin while treate d with a single 1200 mg dose of oritavancin.  Of these 
16 patients, 10 were on warfarin prior to starting oritavancin, 4 received warfarin 
therapy after starting oritavancin therapy and for 2 patients the timing of warfarin 
therapy is unknown.  None of the se 16 patients discontinued from the study early due to 
adverse events.  One patient experienced an event of infusion site thrombosis 2 days 
prior to the administration of warfarin therapy but there were no other bleeding or 
thrombotic related events.  Add itionally, no abnormal prothrombin time coagulation 
tests were reported in the oritavancin treated patients.   
This study will extend the above safety data in patients with ABSSSI when oritavancin 
and warfarin are given concomitantly.   
In addition, a grou p of patients with ABSSSI, who are not on concomitant warfarin 
therapy, have been added to this study to obtain information regarding the potential for 
antibody production following a single dose of oritavancin administration in patients.  
This has not bee n previously tested, therefore plasma will be collected at regular 
intervals after oritavancin dosing to test for immunoglobulins, direct and indirect 
Coombs, and presence of oritavancin antibodies.     
The 1200 mg dose of oritavancin is the United States (US) approved  therapeutic dose.

The Medicines Company   Final 17  March 2016 5. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS  
5.1. STUDY MEDICATIONS  
Each subject  will receive a single 1200 mg IV  dose of oritavancin .  Oritavancin  will be 
prepared by the study pharmacist/designee.  
5.1.1.  Oritavancin  
Oritavancin will be supplied as a lyophilized powder in single -use glass vials. 
Each vial will contain 400  mg of oritavancin.  
Three 400-mg vials will be required for each subject receiving  oritavancin . At 
the time of use, each vial wil l be reconstituted by adding 40  mL of Sterile Water 
for Injection, United States  Pharmacopeia , to each 400 -mg vial of oritavancin. 
Vials reconstituted i n this manner will provide a 10  mg/mL solution. After 
reconstitution, oritavancin should be further diluted in 5% dextrose in water 
(D5W ) to provide  a total volume of approximately 1000  mL. Since the 
solubility  of oritavancin is highly dependent upon pH, no other material or 
diluent may be substituted or concomitantly in fused through the same IV line. 
The IV line should be flushed with D5W  before and after ; saline must not be 
used since it may cause precipitatio n. 
Each subject will receive a  single  oritavancin dose of 1200 mg in 1000  mL of 
D5W administered as a constant -rate IV infusion over 3 hours via a single

5.1.4.  Accountability  
The investigator or designee must maintain an inventory record of all study 
medications received and administered to assure the regulatory authorities and 
the Sponsor that the drug will not be dispensed to any person who is not a 
subject un der the terms and conditions set forth in this protocol. Drug 
accountability forms and/or specific instructions can be found in the Pharmacy 
Manual.  
The oritavancin supplied for use in this study is to be prescribed only by the 
principal investigator or de signated sub -investigators and may not be used for 
any purpose other than that outlined in this protocol.  
During the study , all used oritavancin  containers ( e.g., empty vials/bottles)  will 
be kept until the monitor has reviewed the accountability records.  
All used and unused oritavancin supplied for this study  will be destroyed on site 
once inventoried and the monitor has review ed the accountability records. In the 
event that oritavancin needs to be returned for any other reason, the site will  
receive a wri tten request listing the drug lot number(s) to be returned and the 
reason for the return request.

The Medicines Company   Final 17  March 2016 8. ADVERSE EVENTS   
8.1. DEFINITIONS  
8.1.1.  Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a 
subject or clinical investigation subject administered a medicinal product and 
which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An 
AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign  (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding) , symptom or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.  
Planned hospital a dmissions and/or surgical operations for an illness or disease 
that existed before the drug was given or the subject was enrolled  in a clinical 
study are not to be considered AEs.  
Subjects experiencing adverse events should be followed clinically until the ir 
health has returned to baseline status or until all parameters have returned to 
normal or have otherwise been explained.  It is expected that the investigator 
will provide or arrange appropriate supportive care for the subject if necessary.  
8.1.1.1.  AE Severity  
The severity of an AE will be assessed by the investigator.  The 
investigator should ensure that any subject experiencing an AE 
receives appropriate medical support until the event resolves.  
AEs will be graded on a 3 -point scale and reported as indicated o n the 
case report form.  The intensity of an AE is defined as follows:  
1 = Mild:  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.  
2 = Moderate:  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily 
activity.  
3 = Severe:  Inability to work or perform normal daily activity.  
8.1.1.2.  Study Drug Causality  
The relationship of an AE to study treatment will be assessed with 
consideration to the following criteria:  
 Temporal relationship to the initiation of study medication  
 Response of the event to withdrawal of study medication  
 AE profile of concomitant therapies  
 Clinical circumstances during which the AE occurred  
Oritavancin diphosphate  Clinic al Study Protocol MDCO -ORI-14-03 Amendment 2 
Confidential  Page 34 
The Medicines Company   Final 17  March 2016  Subject’s clinical condition and medical history  
Categorization  of causality will be designated by the investigator as 
stated below:  
1. Unlikely relat ed - Lack of reasonable possibility of a causal 
relationship - causal relationship between the event and the IMP. 
This means that there are little to no facts (evidence) or arguments 
to suggest a causal relationship . 
2. Reasonable Possibility  - Reasonable pos sibility of a causal 
relationship - causal relationship between the event and the IMP. 
This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest 
a causal relationship . 
8.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any 
dose:  
 Results in death,  
 Is life -threatening, i.e., the subject was, in the opinion of the investigator, at 
immediate  risk of death from the event as it occurred (it does not include an 
event that, had i t occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death),  
 Results in a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, 
damage or disruption in the subject's body function/structure, physical 
activities and/or quality of life,  
 Requires in -patient  hospitalization or prolongs hospitalization,  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
 Is another medically significant event that, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prev ent one of the outcomes listed above (e.g., allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency department or 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs. Severity is an 
estimate or measure of the intensity of an AE, while the criteria for serious AEs 
are indications of adverse subject outcomes for regulatory reporting purposes. A 
severe AE need not necessarily be considered serious and a serious AE need not 
be considered severe. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but not an SAE. On the other hand, a myocardial 
infarction (MI) that may be considere d minor could also be an SAE if it 
prolonged hospitalization.  
Oritavancin diphosphate  Clinic al Study Protocol MDCO -ORI-14-03 Amendment 2 
Confidential  Page 35 
The Medicines Company   Final 17  March 2016 When death occurs with an SAE, the cause of death must be reported as an 
SAE. “Fatal” will be reported as the outcome for these events.  
8.1.3.  Medication Errors  
 Medication error refers to any unintend ed error in the dosing and 
administration of the study product as per instructions in the protocol.  
Medication Errors generally fall into 4 categories as follows:  
1. wrong medication  
2. wrong dose (including dosing regimen, strength, form, concentration, 
amount);  
3. wrong route of administration;  
4. wrong patient (i.e. not administered to the intended patient)  
Medication Errors include occurrences of overdose and underdose of the study 
product(s), and misuse.  
Overdose:  Administration of a quantity of the study product given per 
administration or per day which is above the maximum recommended dose 
according to the reference safety information or protocol for the investigational 
product or comparator as applicable. This a lso takes into account cumulative 
effects due to overdose.  
Underdose:  Administration of a quantity of the study product given per 
administration or per day which is under the minimum recommended dose 
according to the reference safety information or protoc ol for the investigational 
product.  
Misuse: Intentional and inappropriate use of a medicinal product not in 
accordance with the prescribed or authorised dose, route of administration, 
and/or the indication(s) or not within the legal status of its supply ( e.g. without 
prescription for medicinal products subject to medical prescription).  
8.1.4.  Reporting Medication Errors  
Medication errors with or without an associated AE need to be recorded as 
medication errors in the eCRF as described in Section 8.2.  
Medication  errors with an associated SAE need to be recorded as medication 
errors in the eCRF and reported to MDCO Global Pharmacovigilance as 
described in Section 8.3.  
A mis -dosing protocol deviation (refer to Section 12.3 ) would need to be 
reported as a medicatio n error if it was an “unintended error” as defined in 
Section 8.1.3 . 
Oritavancin diphosphate  Clinic al Study Protocol MDCO -ORI-14-03 Amendment 2 
Confidential  Page 36 
The Medicines Company   Final 17  March 2016 8.1.5.  Reporting Events of Pregnancy  
Occurrences of pregnancy in a study subject or study subject’s partner , 
including pregnancies detected anytime from administration  of oritavancin  until 
60 da ys after administration  of oritavancin , must be  reported within 24 hours 
using the Pregnancy Reporting form. In cases where a pregnancy occurs with a 
Serious Adverse Event, the Serious Adverse Event reporting form should be 
used to report the SAE and the P regnancy Reporting form should be used to 
report the pregnancy. Any spontaneous abortion must be captured as a SAE.  
When a pregnancy occurs without any intercurrent SAE, the Pregnancy 
Reporting form may be submitted alone.  Follow -up through pregnancy 
outcome is required if a pregnancy is detected during this study.   
The Medicines Company or its designee will contact the investigator, if 
necessary, to clarify any of the pregnancy information. The investigator will 
provide follow -up information to MDCO or i ts designee as soon as it becomes 
available. Additionally, if required by local regulations or procedures, the 
investigator will report pregnancies to the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) and/or national or local regulatory authoritie s. 
8.2. PROCEDURE FOR NON -SERIOUS  ADVERSE EVENT RECORD ING  
All non -serious AEs that occur during the designated study period (from signing  the 
inform consent to 14 days following initial oritavancin administration ) must be assessed 
and recorded on the source documents and eCRF, regardless of causal relationship to 
the study drug.   
8.3. PROCEDURE FOR SERIOU S ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING  
All SAEs that occur during the designated study period ( from signing the inform ed 
consent  to 14 days following initial warfarin  administration ) must be reported to The 
Medicines Company (MDCO) within 24 hours of awareness of the event using the 
provided study specific SAE Report Form. The completion and processing of the SAE 
Report Form (paper ) should follow the instructions provided in the SAE Report Form 
completion guidelines.  In addition to completing the SAE Report Form, each SAE 
must be entered on the appropriate page of the eCRF.   
The investigator must assess the causality for each SAE.  
MDCO will contact the investigator, if necessary, to clarify any of the event 
information. The investigator should provide any follow -up information for the event to 
MDCO as soon as it becomes available.  
If the investigator is notified of a n SAE that occu rs during post-study period, that he or 
she wishes to report to the Sponsor (e.g., an event suspected to be causally related to 
study drug), the event should be reported through the process described above.

The Medicines Company   Final 17  March 2016 9. DATA COLLECTION  
An electronic data capture (EDC) system will be used for this trial.  All users will be trained on 
the technical features of the EDC as well as the content of the eCRF by qualified personnel 
prior to gaining access to the EDC.  A User ID /Password will be g ranted after training.  This 
ID is not to be shared amongst the study staff.  All users must have a unique account to enter or 
review data.  The eCRF should be filled out by the site 5 days after the Day 7 visit and 3 days 
after the Day 14 visit. It is not  expected that the eCRF will serve as source for any data 
collected in this trial.  If there is a reason for a site to do so, it must be approved by MDCO and 
documented in the site files.  
Prior to the database being locked, the investigator or designee wil l review, approve and 
sign/date each completed eCRF.  This signature serves as attestation of the Investigator’s 
responsibility for ensuring that all data entered into the eCRF are complete, accurate and 
authentic. After the end of the trial, a copy of the  data will be provided to the site.  This copy 
will contain the final data, an audit trail of activity on the data, and any queries and answers 
that were posted for data clarification.

10.3.3.1.  Adverse Events  
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) will be 
used for c oding AEs. An AE (classified by system organ class and 
preferred term) that occurs  during the treatment period  will be counted 
as a treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) either if  it is not present at 
Baseline  or if it is present at Baseline  but increased in severity during 
the treatment period  or follow up period . 
The number (percentage) of subjects reporting TEAEs for each 
preferred term will be tabula ted by system  organ class, by system  
organ class and severity, and by system  organ class a nd relationship to 
oritavancin . If more than 1 event occurred with the same preferred 
term for the same subject, the subject will be counted only once for 
that preferred term using the most severe or related occurrence for the 
summary by severity, or relationship to study drug, respectively.  
Listings of SAEs  and AEs leading to treatment or study 
discontinuation will also be provided.  
10.3.3.2.  Clinical Safety Laboratory Te sts 
Clinical safety l aboratory values and changes from Baseline , including  
prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR),  direct and 
indirect Coombs, Immunoglobulin panel, oritavancin antibody assay,   
will be summarized descriptively . Clinica lly significant (CS) values 
will also be flagged  in a listing . 
10.3.3.3.  Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements and changes from Baseline will be 
summarized descriptively at each scheduled time  point . Potentially 
clinically significant changes  will also be flagged  in a listing .

11. RECORDS RETENTION  
Current Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) regulations require all investigators 
participating in clinical drug trials to maintain detailed clinical data for one of the following 
periods:  
 At least 2 years following the dat e on which a New Drug Application is approved by the 
FDA, or  
 Two years after the Sponsor notifies the investigator that no further applicat ion is to be 
filed with the FDA  
Similarly, International Conference on Harmonization  (ICH) guidelines require that es sential 
documen ts be retained until at least 2  years after the last approval of a marketing application in 
an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an 
ICH region or a t least 2  years have elapsed since the forma l discontinuation of clinical 
development of the investigational product.  
To comply with these requirements, the investigator will not dispose of any records relevant to 
this study without either (1) written permission from the Sponsor or (2) providing an 
opportunity for the Sp onsor to collect such records. The investigator shall take responsibility 
for maintaining adequate and accurate hard copy source documents of all observations and data 
generated during this study, including any data clarification form s received from the Sponsor. 
Such documentation is subject to inspection by the Sponsor or its agents, the FDA and/or other 
regulatory agencies.

12.1. MONITORING  
The Sponsor has ethical, legal , and scientific obligations to carefully follow this study 
in accordance with established research principl es and applicable regulations. The 
investigator, as part of his responsibilities, is expected to cooperate with the Sponsor in 
ensuring that the stud y adheres to the protocol and GCP requirements.  
As part of a concerted effort to fulfill  these obligations, the Sponsor’ s monitor will visit 
the study center during the study in accordance with the Monitoring Plan set forth for 
this tr ial. The investigator  will permit the Sponsor to monitor the study as frequently as 
is deemed necessary and provide access to medical records/source documents to ensure 
that data are being recorded adequately, that data are verifiable , and that protocol 
adherence is satisfacto ry. 
12.2. AUDITING  
The Sponsor may conduct audits at the study center s. Audits will include, but will not 
be limited to, drug supply, presence of required documents, the informed consent 
process, and comparison of eCRFs with source documents.  The investigator ag rees to 
permit audits conducted at a reasonable time in a reasonable manner.  
Regulatory authorities worldwide may also inspect the investiga tor during or after the 
study. The investigator should contact the Sponsor immediately if this occurs, and must 
perm it regulatory authority inspections.  
12.3. PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
This study will be conducted as described in this protocol, except for an emergency 
situation in which t he protection, safety, and well -being of the subject requires 
immediate intervention, based on the judgment of the investigator (or a responsible, 
appropriately trained professional d esignated by the investigator).  
In the event of a significant deviation from the protocol due to an emergency, accident, 
or mistake, the investigator or designee must c ontact the Sponsor  (Clinical Project 
Director , Medical Director or Clinical Research Associate) at the earliest possible time. 
This will allow an early joint decision regarding the subject’s continuation in the study. 
The investigator and the Spons or will document this decision.  
The IRB/ EC will be informed of all protocol changes by the investigator in accord ance 
with the IRB/ EC-established procedure. No deviations from the protocol of any type 
will be made without complying with all IRB/ EC-established procedures.  
Any protocol deviations that will affect the subject’s safety or the study objectives may 
be considered a Major Protocol Deviation upon review by the Sponsor.  In addition, 
any of t he following deviations will be considered Major Protocol Devia tions:

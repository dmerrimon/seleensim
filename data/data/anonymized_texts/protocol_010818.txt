2.2   Hypotheses to be Tested : 
• Hypothesis 1: Genetic variability in the SLC6A2  gene is associated with 
variability in 1) concentration -time curves of DHPG and 2) pupil size 
changes, when evaluating tonic and phasic data.  
• Hypothesis 2: Variability in pharmacodynamics markers, i.e. plasma DHPG 
and pupil size changes, are associated with clinical response to 
atomoxetine.  
• Hypothesis 3: The atomoxetine response cohorts (i.e. response versus 
non-response and tolerant versus non -tolerant) will have differing global 
baseline characteristics, such as age, gender, ethnicity, ADHD  subtype, 
genetic polymorphisms, etc.

Page 24 of 143 3.0 Background  
3.1 Atomoxetine Background and Gaps in Knowledge  
Atomoxetine (ATX), Strattera®, is a norepinephrine re -uptake transporter inhibitor that 
is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of attention 
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  (Seneca et al., 2006; Michelson et al., 2007) . The 
drug is often considered a second - or third -line agent, due to the perception that the 
drug does not work very well.  In fact, in a review of studies submitted to the FDA, 
Newcorn et al reported that there appeared to be discrete classes of response to 
atomoxetine. Afte r 6-9 weeks of treatment, 47% of the patients were considered 
“responders” based on changes in the rating scales used to measure ADHD symptoms 
whereas 40% of patients were considered non -responders  (Newcorn et al., 2 009) .  
Statistically significant (p<0.001) differences in scores between responders and non -
responders were apparent after the first week of treatment (Fig. 1).   
 
At the relatively low starting doses of the titration scheme, this suggests that there may 
be a subgroup of patents who are particularly responsive to ATX.  We hypothesize that 
there could be two reasons for this: 1) variability in drug pharmacokinetics (i .e., 
inadequate drug concentrations in the blood over time could lead to poor response) and 
2) variability in drug pharmacodynamics (i.e. differences at the level of the target of 
drug action that limit the response to a drug, regardless of concentration o f drug 
present in the blood). The interplay of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics is 
presented in Figure 2 below:    

SHORT TITLE: ATX -PBPK -PD-Clinical Outcomes (U54)  
 
Page 25 of 143  
Fig 2. Interplay of Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamics  
The CYP2D6  gene, which encodes for the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP2D6 responsible 
for the clearance of ATX from the body, is highly polymorphic (Gaedigk et al., 2007; 
Gaedigk et al., 2010; Gaedigk et al., 2010; Gaedigk, 2013) . ATX metabolism by CYP2D6 
protein is one of the major routes of clearance (i.e., removal) of this drug. Genetic 
variability in the CYP2D6  gene leads to wide inter -individual variability in the activity of 
the enzyme, ultimately resulting in differing amount of drug in the body (also referred to 
as “exposure,” and is a component of drug pharmacokinetics). Secondly, the SLC6A2  
gene which enco des for the norepinephrine reuptake transporter, the drug target for 
ATX, is also subject to genetic variation. Reported genetic variants of SLC6A2  have been 
associated with decreased abundance of the transporter (Kim et al., 2006) . The 
consequences of SLC6A2  genetic variation with regards to ATX clinical response are 
currently unknown.  In the context of distinct “responder” and “non -responder” groups 
with a population of atomoxetine -treated patients, non -response could be due to 
definable differences at the level of the drug target (patients unlikely to respond 
regardless of the ATX concentrations achieved), or simply a consequence of inadequate 
exposure in a substantial proportion of population.  The goal of  this study is to address 
this issue.  
 
3.2 Relevant Preliminary Data  
In a previous single -dose ATX pharmacokinetic study conducted at the Children’s 
Mercy Hospital, we investigated the impact of CYP2D6 genetic variability on drug 
pharmacokinetics as an in itial step in better understanding the poor clinical 
response to the drug (Brown et al., 2016) . The results from the single -dose ATX 
study found that ATX exposures varied greatly between children (30 -50 fold) 
when administered the same weight -adjusted dose (0.5 mg/kg) with the highest 
concentrations/exposure in participants deficient in CYP2D6 acti vity (so -called 

SHORT TITLE: ATX -PBPK -PD-Clinical Outcomes (U54)  
 
Page 26 of 143 “poor metabolizers”) and the lowest exposure in participants who had two or 
more functional copies of the gene, and the highest CYP2D6 activity.  
Furthermore, simulations conducted to investigate the concentrations 
(exposure) achieved with chronic dosing indicated that a majority of patients 
with at least one functional copy of the CYP2D6 gene were unlikely to achieve 
the level of exposure associated with clinical response.   
A more important implication of these data is that it is impossibl e to investigate 
the effect of differences at the level of the drug target on variability in drug 
response unless we are able to minimize the variability in drug response that is a 
consequence of the normal variability in exposure when the same dose (0.5 
mg/kg) is given to patients who differ in their ability to eliminate the drug.  In 
other words, we need to develop models and systems by which we can 
individualize the dose of ATX so that every person has the same exposure. The 
data collected from this sing le-dose pharmacokinetic study were subsequently 
used to build a dosing algorithm to determine a dose that would lead to a 
desired exposure, defined initially as the peak concentration achieved (C max) with 
a priori  knowledge of a child’s CYP2D6 genetic info rmation, which can be used to 
predict activity, in addition to other patient characteristics such as weight and 
obesity status. The process for validation of this model, termed the 
individualized Genetic and Ontogenic Pharmaco kinetics algorithm (iGO -PK), i s 
described in the ATX PBPK Model Validation Study (Appendix A). The major 
strength of this dosing strategy is that it allows us to ensure that drug exposures 
do not greatly differ in children, and therefore allows us to describe 
quantitatively how genetic  variability at the drug target alone affects ATX 
pharmacodynamics and clinical outcomes.  
 
3.3 Study Significance  
Prior studies evaluating variability in drug response are confounded by the highly 
variable ATX exposures between children, even when given th e same weight -based 
dose, and hence are difficult to interpret (e.g ., is a patient truly non -responsive to the 
medication, or is “non -response” simply due to having inadequate concentrations of the 
medication in the body).  In this investigation we propose to individualize ATX dosing in 
a cohort of children with ADHD to a s tandardized exposure goal (based on the maximum 
concentration achieved, or C max), initially using a iGO -PK model derived from our original 
genotype -stratified PK study, and assign responder or non -responder status according 
to response criteria established  a priori  by the clinical members of the study team.  
Subsequent analyses will investigate predictors of response (metabolomics analysis of 
pretreatment plasma samples; assessment of biomarkers of ATX inhibition of SLC6A2, 
such as dihydroxyphenylglycol (DH PG) concentrations and pupil diameter and eye -
tracking studies; SLC6A2 genotype; pharmacokinetic -pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis 
of ATX and DHPG data, etc), as well as differences in exposure→response relationships 
for different DHPG strata or SLC6A2 geno types.  In addition, the dosing algorithms (iGO -
SHORT TITLE: ATX -PBPK -PD-Clinical Outcomes (U54)  
 
Page 27 of 143 PK) will be updated and revised as the body of pharmacokinetic data increases through 
the duration of the study.  
4.0 Study Endpoints  and Rationale  
 
4.1 Primary Study Endpoints  
 
The primary aims of this study focus on characterizing the relationship between changes 
in pharmacodynamic markers and clinical outcome measures, when inter -subject 
variability in ATX pharmacokinetics has been minimized  (Fig. 3) . ATX pharmacodynamics 
will be measured using plasma DHPG and metabolomic data, pupillometry during 
attention tasks, and changes in blood pressure and heart rate  . Clinical outcomes will be 
assessed by standardized ADHD measures  used in a clinical setting , of which include: 
NICHQ Vanderbilt Assessment  Scale  (ADHD symptom rating scale) ; Strengths and 
Difficulties Questionnaire ; Child Behavior Checklist; the School Intervention 
Questionnair e; Medication Side Effects; and Clinical Glo bal Impression . Some of these 
questionnaires  will also capture comorbidity info rmation, such as Oppositional Defiant 
Disorder (ODD). We will also use the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and 
Schizophren ia for School -Age Children – Present and Lifetime Version (K -SADS -PL) or K-
SADS -COMP (the computerized version of the K -SADS -PL) to diagnose ADHD and 
commonly associated comorbidities.  The K -SADS -PL is a semi -structured interview  that 
is extensively used in clinical psychology research to diagnose an extensive array of 
psychopathology based on the DSM -5. Given the length of this interview, c ommon 
research practices are to select only the modules t hat are  expected to be pertinent  to 
the study participant  (Black et al., 2012; Kariuki et al., 2018; Caudle et al., 2020) . The K -
SADS -PL modules selected for this research study are as follows: agoraphobia, 
separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder/selective mutism, specific phobias, 
generalized anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, and post -traumatic stress disorder.  
The other research comorbidities or impairments t hat we will assess for and associated 
psychometric tests we will use are as follows : impairment in executive function using 
the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF); anxiety using the Screen for 
Child Anxiety and Related Disorders (SCARE D); intelligence quotient  using the Kaufman 
Brief IQ Test (KBIT); and sluggish cognitive tempo using the Barkley Sluggish Cognitive 
Tempo Scale (SCT). Pharmacodynamic data will be obtained: baseline (Research Visit 1); 
when ATX is f irst initiated in a participant  with the first dose (Res earch Visit 2) ; when the 
participant has taken the medi cation chronically and thus, expected to be at steady -
state (Research Visit 3) ; and at the end of study when the dose has been optimized for 
the participant (Researc h Visit 4). Concurrent pharmacokinetic analysis will take place to 
ensure that ATX plasma and urine exposure variability has been minimized  using 
methods described in a previous ATX pharmacokinetic study conducted at Children’s 
Mercy Hospital (Brown et al., 2016) . Additionally, we will measure ATX  and metabolites 
in sweat as surrogate for fraction of drug unbound (Marchei et al., 2012; Marchei et al., 
2013) . The clinical ADHD questionnaires will be administered at the Intake Visit and at 
follow -up visits following initiation of atomoxetine treatment (6 -weeks, 12 -weeks, and 
SHORT TITLE: ATX -PBPK -PD-Clinical Outcomes (U54)  
 
Page 28 of 143 18 wee ks). These  questionnaires ask the participant’s parents and teachers to rate 
behaviors characte ristic of ADHD. Changes in other comorbidities associated with ADHD, 
such as anxiety or sluggish cognitive temp o, will be evaluated at Research Visit 1 and at 
Research Visit 4. We will also simultaneously monitor side effects of ATX, another 
measure of cli nical outcomes, and categorize study participants on their ability to 
tolerate ATX. Adverse events will be assessed at all encounters between the study 
personnel and study participant.  At Research Visit 4, we will also administer the Dietary 
Survey Questio nnaire, given that long -term dietary habits may affect both ATX 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.  
 
 
Fig 3.  - Analysis of Study Endpoints  
 
ATX is thought to exert its therapeutic effect in ADHD through inhibition of the 
presynaptic norepinephrine (NE) transporter (NET) encoded by the SLC6A2 gene.  NE is 
involved in several neuropsychological functions, including visual attention, general 
alertness, sustained attention, learning and memory and executive functions; 
dysregulation of NE homeostasis has been implicated in the development of ADHD.  
Consequently , there has been considerable interest in SLC6A2 as a candidate gene for 
ADHD, but the res ults of studies investigation associations between SLC6A2 allelic 
variants and ADHD and related phenotypes have been inconsistent and discordant.  Of

SLC6A2 gene.  The minor -3081 T allele has been associated with a reduction in 
promoter activity, which would result in lower expression of the NET transporter.  
 
In vitro , as well as in vivo animal and human studies have p rovided evidence that plasma 
concentrations of 3,4 -dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) are derived predominantly from NE 
inside nerve cells.  As a consequence, inhibition of NE reuptake by ATX is accompanied 
by decreases in NE inside presynaptic nerve cells, and subsequently, decreases in 
plasma DHPG concentrations.  Published studies in adults indicate that DHPG 
concentrations in plasma progressively decrease for the first four hours following ATX 
administration and gradually recover in 24 hours; comparable data in children with 
ADHD receiving ATX have not been reported.  In contrast, single doses of a structurally 
related norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, edivoxetine to adolescents produced an 
average reduction in baseline DHPG of 28% across all tested doses.  W ith chronic dosing, 
the reduction in DHPG concentration persisted for at least 12 hours.  Of particular 
interest is the observation that no reduction from baseline was observed in two 
subjects, both of whom had relatively low baseline concentrations of 431  pg/ml and 657 
pg/ml and for whom the lack of response could not be attributed to low drug exposure; 
no information regarding clinical response was provided.  These considerations provide 
the basis for assessing DHPG as a potential biomarker of clinical re sponse to ATX, and 
specifically for investigating the relationship between the magnitude of reduction in 
plasma DHPG concentration as a function of ATX concentration, and how it translates 
into clinical response in children with ADHD.  As ATX selectively b inds to NET in the 
prefrontal cortex and modulates the reuptake of not only norepinephrine, but also 
dopamine, we propose to conduct a comprehensive analysis of neurotransmitters, 
including norepinephrine, dopamine, DHPG and several of the breakdown produc ts (see 
Secondary Aims).  (Kielbasa et al., 2009; Kielbasa and Lobo, 2015; Kielbasa et al., 2015) . A 
similar approach has been applied to serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors for adults 
with major depressive disorder. Responders and non -responders 
citalopram/escitalopram displayed significantly different baseline metabolomics 
signatures (Kaddurah -Daouk et al., 2011) . 
 
In addition to DHPG as a pharmacodynamics marker, we also propose to investigate a 
biomarker of SLC6A2/NET inhibition in the brain. The SLC6A2/NET transporter is 
expressed both in the central nervous system (i.e., the brain) and peripheral nervous 
systems (i.e, the rest of the body), the measurement of change in plasma DHPG likely 
represents a combination of drug binding at both sites. To differentiate between 
SLC6A2/NET peripherally and in the brain, we will collect additional data.  To assess 
peripheral i nhibition we will also monitor heart rate and blood pressure as measures of 
ATX drug action in the peripheral nervous system. Current information suggests that 
controlled release of norepinephrine by a region of the brain called the locus coeruleus 
is resp onsible for optimal attention and alertness during cognitive tasks.  Functional MRI 
data collected in  20 healthy male adults administered with a single dose of 40 mg

Page 30 of 143 atomoxetine  found activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus, a region that is 
associa ted with inhibitory control (Chamberlain et al., 2009) . Furthermore, there is a U -
shaped relationship between norepinephrine release and task performance insofar that 
too little or too much norepinephrine leads to decreased attention and problematic task 
performance, while low -to-moderate levels of norepinephrine are considered optimal 
for maintaining alertness and attention during cognitiv e tasks. Moreover, pupil diameter 
changes mirror  norepinephrine release  in the locus coeruleus in non -human primates 
(Gilzenrat et al., 2010 ).  In a carefully c ontrolled experiment, where light levels were 
held constant during a well -established test of attention, one research group 
demonstrated that more difficult cognitive tasks were associated with decreases in pupil 
diameter. In contrast, larger pupil diamete rs were associated with exploratory behavior, 
poorer task performance and disengagement.  Thus, the magnitude of increase  in pupil 
size in response to standardized tasks during ATX treatment offers potential as a 
biomarker of central  inhibition of NET acti vity. See the section below for further details 
regarding this test of attention.  
 
Attentional Orienting and Pupil Size Measurement  
Eye movement and dilation in response to attentional -shift requiring tasks will be used 
to measure ATX drug action in the CNS. The tasks are based on a modified Posner Cuing 
Task, which measures both endogenous and exogenous orientation of attention, which  
correspond to tonic and phasic  locus coeruleus activation. This is an established non -
invasive method to measure norepinephrine signaling in the brain. Assessment will take 
place at both the ADHD  Specialty clinic and at the PCRU. Participants will be aske d to sit 
57 cm from a computer monitor, which is housed in a light dome to maintain a 
consistent level of illumination. Volunteers will be asked to place their chin in a 
mounted chin rest to stabilize the facial area. Each study participant will be asked t o 
complete target localization and target discrimination tasks. Both tasks begin with the 
participants looking at two white squares on black background. In between these two 
boxes will be a white fixation cross. Participants will be asked to begin each tri al by 
focusing on the fixation cross. Next, a cue is given. In this case, one of two boxes 
brightening will serve as the cue. Following the cue, a target will appear in one of the 
two boxes by presentation of an “O” or a “Q” in one of the two boxes. Partic ipants will 
be asked to push colored buttons on the game controller that correspond with the 
correct answer when presented with the target. If the target appears in the box that 
was brightened, this is defined as a valid trial. When this does not occur, th is is 
considered an invalid trial. Half of the trials will be designed to be invalid. The valid and 
invalid cues serve to measure directing of attention by study participants. Volunteers 
will be measured for their ability to localize the target ( e.g. did t he target appear on the 
left or right box?) and discriminate the target ( e.g. is the target a “Q” or an “O”?) 
following the cue. In localization tasks, if the target appears on the left side, volunteers 
will be asked to push the blue button. When the targe t is on the right side, a successful 
trial would mean the volunteer pushed the red button. In discrimination tasks, if the 
target presented is a “Q” the volunteer will be asked to push the red button, while an 
“O” target means the volunteer should press th e blue button. Volunteers will be given

Page 31 of 143 the opportunity to practice the tasks (3 trials). Measurements will be recorded for 162 
trials which for both localization and discrimination tasks. Eye -moment, dilation, and 
reaction time will be measured during all  tasks. Please see Figures 1 and 2  in the 
Appendix H of this document. Figure 1 illustrates an example of a valid and invalid trial 
for successful completion of the localization task, while Figure 2  illustrates an example 
of a valid and invalid trial for s uccessful completion of the discrimination task. (Aston -
Jones and Cohen, 2005; Alnaes et al., 2014)  
 
Secondary Study Endpoints:  
 
The secondary aims focus on: exploring baseline patient characteristics that may 
predispose an individual to have beneficial clinical response from ATX therapy; 
refinement of the iGO -PK dosing algorithm; exploration of the role of the microbiome in 
impacting ATX pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics; validation of a urinary CYP2D6 
biomarker; and exploring ways improve study participant understanding of research 
procedures. A previous study with an anti -depressant, citalopram, suggests that the 
ability to respond positively to a medication may be predicted given an understanding of 
the individuals’ composite of signaling molecules, i.e. the global neurotransmitter 
profile. We are intere sted in comparing the baseline global neurotransmitter profile 
between children who do and do not respond. We are also interested in understanding 
how the neurotransmitter profile changes with chronic ATX use and correlating these 
changes with clinical ben efit of toxicity. To do this, we will evaluate a panel of 
approximately 30 neurotransmitters (Gupta et al., 2016) (refer to  Appendix  I for example 
list) prior to treatment and during treatment with ATX.  
 
Because there is evidence that the gut microbiome can to influence host 
neurotransmitter concentrations (Petra et al., 2015) , we would like to evaluate this as a 
possible confounder to the global neurotransmitter profile. Given that the oral and gut 
micr obiome landscape correlate well with one another (Zhang et al., 2015)  we will also 
sample saliva to account for factors that could contribute to an individual’s 
neurotransmitter make -up. 
 
The pharmacokinetic data that we collect on each individual participant allows us to 
provide more information for modeling, and for further refinement. We recognized in 
our previous pharmacokinetic study that CYP2D6 activity, as measured using a 
phenotypic marker (urinary dextromethorphan/dextrorphan rat io), was the best 
predictor of ATX exposure. This urinary ratio was associated with ~75% of variability 
observed in ATX exposure in the study. We would like to explore a urinary biomarker 
that is reflective of CYP2D6 activity that has previously been studi ed (Tay -Sontheimer et 
al., 2014)  for possible inclusion in the iGO -PK model. Validation of this biomarker with 
ATX exposure is necessary prior to consideration as a variable in the iGO -PK algorithm.  
 
Lastly, we recognize that our patient population will include young children and that 
lengt hy consent forms may not be optimal for conveying information. We plan to 
SHORT TITLE: ATX -PBPK -PD-Clinical Outcomes (U54)  
 
Page 32 of 143 distribute a supplemental illustrated booklet  (please refer to Supplementary 
Documents , “U54 Study Booklet”)  explaining study procedures along with a standard 
consent form to all participants approached for the study. A short questionnaire will 
accompany the booklet, asking study participants and their families to evaluate the 
study booklet (please refer to Appe ndix G) in helping with their clarity and 
comprehension of the study.  
 
4.2 Primary Safety Endpoints  
 
Participant  baseline health, including behaviors, will be recorded at Research Visit 
1 with  a physical exam, baseline electrocardiogram, medical history, and 
concomitant  medication history. Additionally, baseline health and behavior data will be 
captured at the  Intake  Visit  with the Study  Physician.  Adverse  events will also be closely 
monitored. These  are defined by Children’s Mercy Hospital Report able Events Research 
Policy and Procedures as “untoward or unfavorable occurrences in a human subject, 
including an abnormal sign [e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding], 
symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participat ion in the 
research,  whether or not  considered related to the subject’s participation in the 
research.”  Additionally, an adverse event is also defined as behaviors or symptoms that 
occur with increased frequency or severity as consequence of the subject’s participation 
in the research study.    
 
Both types of adverse events will be documented in this study.  Adverse events are 
reported in many ways in this study. These include but are not limited to: emails to 
study coordinators/clinical trial manager, phone calls on study cell phone, phone calls to 
ADHD Clinic or Developmental and Behavioral Clinic, reported to study physician at 
clinic visit, reported on Medication Side Effects questionnaires, reported at research 
visits when asked, or via a Cerner notificat ion of admission to the hospital to the study 
physician. Additionally, adverse events will be assessed and documented at Research 
Visit 2, Research Visit 3, Research Visit 4, 6 -week Visit, 12 -week Visit, and 18 -week Visit.   
 
Adverse events  will be categori zed and reported to the IRB as outlined in CM Policy 
regarding adverse events.   These events will be documented consistently, regardless of 
how they were reported. This includes the delegation of an individual member of the 
study personnel to handle all adverse event reporting. All adverse events will be 
recorded at all research visit s and in between visits as needed on the Adverse Event CRF 
kept in  the subject’s  study binder.    
  
In addition, subjects will be classified based on their tolerance of ATX.  A participant is 
considered tolerant of ATX if the side effects did not lead to  discontinuation of ATX 
therapy. A participant is considered  intolerant  of ATX if the  side effects lead to the 
discontinuation of medication  and withdrawal of a subject from the study.

Page 33 of 143 5.0 Study Int ervention/Investigational Agent  
5.1  Description  
ATX is a norepinephrine reuptake transporter inhibitor which is approved by the 
FDA for use in children with ADHD. The medication displays high inter -individual 
pharmacokinetic variability, which has been associated with CYP2D6  genotype. 
An individual’s pr edicted CYP2D6 phenotype can be estimated from their 
genotype. This estimation is quantified as a CYP2D6 activity score  (AS). The 
CYP2D6 predicted phenotype and the participant’s height, weight, habitus, and 
gender are used to inform the ATX dosing tool, t he individualized genetic and 
ontogeny pharmacokinetic model (iG O-PK). Both the CYP2D6 genotype -
predicted phenotype activity score and iGO -PK are described below.  Doses that 
are expected to result in C max,ss values of 400 ng/mL, 600 ng/mL, and 800 ng/mL 
will be calculated for each participant. Study physicians will start with a dosing 
regimen that is predicted to achieve a C max,ss of 400 ng/mL and will titrate the 
dose to reach C max,ss  values of 600 ng/mL or 800 ng/mL according to participant 
response. Stud y physicians may choose to titrate slowly to C max,ss of 400 ng/mL 
when initiating  ATX therapy  to avoid side effects . 
 
CYP2D6  Genotype -Predicted Phenotype Activity Score  
Participants will be assigned a CYP2D6 phenotype based on the CYP2D6 activity score , 
which is  calculated using  CYP2D6  genotype  information. These data are used  to 
determine the design and length of stay of the PK studies. Calculation of an activity 
score is done first by determining the functio nal score for each copy of CYP2D6 present 
in a patient.   
 
When this study was first submitted, a  CYP2D6  allelic variant is given a score of 1 if it is 
considered fully functional when compared to the wild -type reference sequence. If an 
allelic variant is r eported to result in decreased activity, the functional score assigned is 
0.5. It is important to note that a functional score of 0.5 does mean the allelic variant 
exhibted  50% reduction in a ctivity;  rathe r this designation is  meant t o convey that a 
variant had  less activity compared to wild -type, while at the same time not b eing devoid 
of catalytic capability. An allelic variant that results in complete loss of CYP2D6 activity 
was given a functional score of 0. The activity score is a summation of th e functional 
score for all CYP2D6  gene copies. An activity score of 0 or 0.5 w ould have originally  
place d an individual in the poor metabolizer ( PM) or intermediate metabolizer ( IM) 
study design  (i.e. Study Design 1) , and a score ≥ 1 would  assign an indivi dual to an 
extensive metabolizer (EM) study design  (i.e. Study Design 2) . It should be noted that 
individuals in the latter study design were  comprised of EM1s, EM1.5s, EM2s, and ultra -
rapid metabolizers ( UM). (Gaedigk et al., 2008; Hicks et al., 2013; Twist et al., 2013) . 
 
New standardized  guidelines for CYP2D6  genotype -to-phenotype interpretation  were 
recently published in 2020 by  the Clinical Pharmacogenetic Implementation Consortium 
SHORT TITLE: ATX -PBPK -PD-Clinical Outcomes (U54)  
 
Page 34 of 143 (CPIC) (Caudle et al., 2020) , which recommended a different functional score for the 
CYP2D6*10  allelic variant (reduced score to 0.25) and also different phenotype 
assignments ba sed on activity score . The different phenotype designations are listed  in 
the table below .

0.25, *41 = 0.5.  
 
Additionally, data generated from studies conducted at Children’s Mercy Hospital has 
suggest ed that changes in study design assignment are warranted, particularly for 
children with an activity score of 1, whi ch could be a result of having two  reduced 
funct ion CYP2D6 alleles (0.5/0.5)  or one  functional copy and one  non-functional copy of 
CYP2D6 (1/0). The studies mentioned above are: Ped Develop Pharm U54 (IRB# 
16010069) and this study, ATX -PBPK -PD-Clinical Outcomes (U54) (IRB# 16100728). Initial 
analysis su ggests that 0.5/0.5 children have higher ATX exposure compared to 1/0 
children , suggesting slower ATX apparent oral clearance . Additionally, 1/0 children more 
closely resembled children with two fully functional copies  of CYP2D6 in their 
pharmacokinetics.  
 
This preliminary data generated from previous ATX studies and the revised CPIC 
guidelines have prompted the study team to revise study design assignment. Therefore, 
to ensure that each parti cipant’s ATX pharmacokinetics are  accurately characterized, all 
children with an activity < 1 and those who have a two reduced function alleles will be 
assigned to Study Design 1. All other participants will be initially assigned to Study 
Design 2.  
 
Additional genotype testing may be cond ucted if the participant’s pharmacokinetic 
profile and genotype are inconsistent with one another. The additional genotype 
testing, if needed, will be documented on the provided CRF.  
 
iGO-PK Model  
This meth od was developed using data  generated from a previ ous ATX single -dose PK 
study conducted at Children’s Mercy Hospital (Brown et al., 2016) . This model stratifies 
participants into two distinct populations: individuals who are CYP2D6 PM and those 
who non -PMs, i.e. IM, EM1, EM2,  and UM (read above for more details on CYP2D6  
genotype and phenotype prediction). With the new changes to CYP2D6  genotype -to-
SHORT TITLE: ATX -PBPK -PD-Clinical Outcomes (U54)  
 
Page 35 of 143 phenotype interpretation and study design, the only major change is that children with 
two reduced function alleles will be modeled as an IM. Analysis of the previous PK study 
found that in non -PM participants, the dose -exposure relationship was b est described 
using a two -compartment model with first order absorption and first order clearance. In 
PM participants, dose -exposure was best described using a one compartment model 
with first order absorption, first order clearance, and a secondary peakin g component. 
Additionally, lean body weight (LBW) and obesity status (positive or negative) variables 
were found to significantly impact variability in ATX exposure in both models. 
Retrograde extrapolation of an initial dose of ATX for PK Study 1 will be d etermined by 
setting the desired C max goal at steady -state (C max,ss ) to 400 ng/mL, and incorporating 
patient specific parameters CYP2D6 AS, LBW, and obesity status. The actual dose 
dispensed will be as close as possible to the model generated dose, given t he available 
atomoxetine capsule formulations. Additionally, we will also consider the most 
convenient combination of capsules for a child to take and how a prescriber would dose 
this medication in a naturalistic setting.  During the course of the study, we  will also be 
monitoring clinical response and toxicity. The exposure (C max,ss ) may be titrated down to 
below 400 ng/mL to reduce toxicity or up to 800 ng/mL to increase response as 
tolerated.  
 
5.2  Drug Handling  
 
The study drug, ATX, will be stored, prepared, labeled, and dispensed by the CMH 
Investigational Drug Service (IDS) pharmacy.  Study file documentation, accountability, 
and records for dispensing of atomoxetine will be maintained by IDS pharmacy  
personnel.  
 
The study physician will submit a sign ed and dated prescription for ATX to IDS 
Pharmacy. Alternately, designated study personnel will deliver a prescription that has 
been  signed and dated prescription by the study physician to IDS Pharmacy. A copy o f all 
prescriptions will be retained  in the pa rticipant’s study binder . IDS Pharmacy will deliver 
the ATX prescription to the PCRU for Research Visit 2 . Subsequent prescriptions for ATX 
will be filled as needed and will typically occur in conjunction with 6 -wee k, 12 -week, and 
18-week visits.  Medication refills may also occur outside of the 6 -week, 12 -wee k, and 
18-week visits. Medication refills may be handed off or delivered to the participant  to 
reduce foot traffic at Children’s Mercy Hospital, as needed . Dose adjustments may  also 
occur outside of the 6 -week, 12 -week, and 18 -week visits.  
 
All investigational drug will be returned to the study team at the end of the study for 
disposal by the I DS pharmacy, unless the child and their family would like to continue 
using ATX . In addition, if the participant would like to discontinue the study drug, but he 
or she will require an ATX wean to reduce risk of side effects from abrupt 
discontinuation as directed  by his or her study physician , the participant may keep the 
remaining drug to complete this wean .

Activ e recruitment entails study personnel performing regular chart review of patients 
seen through Track 1  and Track 2 (see section 9.2). These two clinics were selected for 
active recruitment because patients and families generally seek care for ADHD at these  
Children’s Mercy Hospital and Clinics locations. As such, these clinics represent the 
largest population of potentially eligible participant population.   
 
Passive Recruitment : Participants will be passively recruited from Track 3 , Track 4  and 
Track 5 .  With passive recruitment, potential participants or their healthcare providers 
self-identify or refer, respectively, potential research participants to the study.   
Potential participants may learn about this study from information posted on the 
internal Children’s Mercy Hospital website and on the Children’s Mercy Research 
Institute (CMRI) public facing website. Social media platforms, such as Twitter and 
Facebook, may be used to disseminate study information. The social media platforms 
will refe rence or link to study information available on the CMRI website. Use of social 
media to share study information will be compliant with any existing CMH policies. The 
use of social media to share study information will not begin until these policies have 
been developed. Presentation of study information and content posted on the CMRI 
website will be at the discretion of the Digital Team, Research Administration, and the 
research team. Modification of images may be applied by the Digital Team and Research 
Administration to in be consistent with the aesthetic of the CMRI webpage. All study 
information will be approved by the IRB (Supplementary document, “CMRI Website 
Information”)  
 
Track 3  allows a mechanism for potential participants within the Children’s Mercy 
Hospital and Clinic systems to participate in this research study, who are not actively 
being recruited. Track 4  allows a mechanism for potential participants outside of the 
SHORT TITLE: ATX -PBPK -PD-Clinical Outcomes (U54)  
 
Page 40 of 143 Childre n’s Mercy Hospital and Clinic systems to participate in this research study.  The 
STP is a summer program for children with ADHD where both behavioral and medical 
therapies are provided.   Track 5  provides a me chanism for STP participants to enroll in 
this s tudy .  
 
 
9.2 Chart Review  
 
The following prescreening information  will be identified from chart review  when 
possible fo r Tracks 1 -5:

questionnaires to gather preliminary information . 
a. The following  questionnaires  will be sent via CHADIS . These 
questionnaires are administered as part of the standard -of-care 
intake  process at ADHD Clinic on College Boulevard.  Information 
collected on these questionnaires provides necessary information for 
prescreening to guage the likelihood these children meet the 
eligibility criteria that would be identified from chart review in other 
tracks. The questionnaires  are: 
i. Child Medical History  (parent informant)  
ii. NICHQ Vanderbilt  Assessment Scale – Initial  Assessment  
(parent and teacher informant)  
iii. Child Behavior Checklist  (parent and teacher informant)  
iv. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire  (parent and teach 
informant)  
v. School Intervention Questionnaire  (teacher informant)  
vi. Please note that all questionnaires (and other versions of 
these questionnaires) are validated clinical measures that aid 
in the diagnosis. Howeve r, these data are used in conjunction 
with Study Physician clinical impressions and do not directly 
determine a diagnosis. Because this, any version of the  
questionnaires listed are permissible in aiding  diagnosis 
determination.  
b. After these questionnaires  are submitted and returned, study 
personnel will review and determine if prescreening criteria are met .  
i. If initial prescreening  criteria are met, s tudy personnel will

prescreen for follow -up care, the study team will write a letter 
to be given to the participant’s primary care provider. (See 
Appendi x M). 
 
Passive Recruitment:  Track 5  
SHORT TITLE: ATX -PBPK -PD-Clinical Outcomes (U54)  
 
Page 44 of 143 1. All participants and their families at STP will be provided the study 
information handout  (please see Supplementary Documents , “Recruitment 
Flyer” ). 
2. A study team member will present study information briefly at the end of a 
weekly beha vioral parent training meeting and answer any 
pare nt/participant questions.  See Supplementary Documents , “STP 
presentation”  for presentation content.   
3. Interested participants may call the study cell phone listed on the handout.  
a. Subsequent steps are the s ame as steps 2 and 3 in “Active 
Recruitment” above.  
b. Base line results from psychometric questionnaires  administered prior 
to beginning STP  (as a requirement of participation in the STP 
program)  will be  obtained from the participant’s electronic medical 
record  and/or STP research records  
 
9.4 PHI Documentation  
 
PHI will be recorded for potential participants prior to obtaining informed 
permission/assent/consent during pre -screening procedures outlined ab ove.  This 
information will be stored securely on the Hospital Share Drive under  the file  name  
“Potential Participant Log .” (see Supplementary Documents , under “U54 Potential 
Participant Log.”) The PHI collected will consist of:  
 
• Patient first and last name  
• Appointment date and appointment location ( PCC or ADHD Clinic)  
• Parent Name  
• Parent Phone Number  
 
Other non -PHI collected on this spreadsheet will include attempts to call the family 
including date, time, notes from the conversation, interest, if consen t form was 
sent, follow -up call attempts after consent form was sent, and enrollment status.  
This spreadsheet of potential participants will only be kept until completion of 
enrollment to avoid duplicate recruitment.  
 
A partial waiver of HIPAA Authorization (waiver for recruitment purposes only) 
was approved at the time of the initial protocol approval (see Notification of Initial 
Approval, 11/29/2016).  
 
Data for participants who are determined to be ineligible for the  study after 
enrollment/upon screening will be stored in the “U54 Master Enrollment Log” and 
will be documented as “screen fails.” (see Supplementary Documents , under “U54 
SHORT TITLE: ATX -PBPK -PD-Clinical Outcomes (U54)  
 
Page 45 of 143 Master Enrollment Log”). The reason for screen fail will also be documented  in the 
participant’s study binder .  
10.0 Study Timelines  
 
10.1   Study Duration  
 
• The duration of an individual subject’s participation in the study  will be 
approximately 6-8 months.  
• The duration anticipated to enroll all subjects  and complete participant study 
procedures  is approximately 5 years ( June  2022) 
• The estimated date for the investigators to complete this study (complete primary 
analysis) is approximately 5 years from when enrollment began (December 2022) . 
11.0 Procedures Involved  
 
11.1 Study Design Overview  
 
This is a longitudinal exposure escalation study of atomoxetine in children with ADHD. 
This s tudy simultaneously measures participants’ pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic profiles after administration  of a single -dose of ATX, approximately 
2-8 weeks, and approximately 18 weeks of chronic use as well as the therapeutic 
efficacy/clinical response after chronic use.  The study design is best illustrated by 
categorizing the chronological visits by phase as illustrated in Figure 4. The phases occur 
in the following order:  
 
1) Prescreen  
2) Enrollment  
3) Screen  
4) Intervention  
SHORT TITLE: ATX -PBPK -PD-Clinical Outcomes (U54)  
 
Page 46 of 143  
Fig. 4  – Study Design Overview  
SHORT TITLE: ATX -PBPK -PD-Clinical Outcomes (U54)  
 
Page 47 of 143 1. Prescreen  
This phase consists of identifying and contacting eligible study participants and 
presenting the study opportunity. See section 9.0 for details.  
 
After a family expresses interest in enrolling, study personnel will contact the 
participant/family to review key parts of the study in preparation for the first research 
visit. See Appendix F “Study Coordinator/Research Assistant Scheduling Script” for 
details. This discussion with review:  
 
a. Frequency and duration of study visits  
b. If a medication washout is required, explanation about washout safety and 
instruction to not begin the washout until written permission/assent or consent 
has been obtained  
c. The study drug is only available in capsule form, so the child will need to be able 
to swallow pills  
d. The study will require multiple blood draws and an IV  
 
2. Enrollment  
Enrollment t ypically takes  place during Research Visit 1 Part 1. Enrollment can occur 
prior to Research Visit 1 Part 1 when a diagnosis of ADHD has not been established or 
the diagnosis cannot be verified by review of EMR.   Additionally, enrollment may occur 
prior to Research Visit 1 Part 1 by phone or telehealth to minimize in -person procedures 
to prevent  SARS -CoV-2 viral transmission . Research Visit 1 Part 1  visit takes place in the 
PCRU and includes obtaining informed consent or permission/assent , gathering 
information about a participant’s comfort with needlesticks and pill swallowing,  
obtaining a blood sample to determine the participant’s genotype, collec ting medical 
history,  demographics,  medication history, and initiating an ADHD medication washout 
if needed.   
 
3. Screen  
After enrollment at Research Visit 1 Part 1, the remaining screening procedures will 
occur  during  Research Visit 1 Part 2 and the Intake Visit  with Study Physician .  
 
If study personnel determine no washout will be required, Research Visit 1 Parts 1 and 2 
may occur in tandem.  However, if a washout will be required, the 2 parts of Research 
Visit 1 wil l occur separately.  After the participant has completed the washout, he or she 
will return for Part 2 to initiate screening procedures.  
 
Research Visit 1 Part 2 takes place in the PCRU and includes obtaining baseline research 
psychometric measures and ba seline safety and research measures to assess for 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. Psychometric measures will be administered via paper 
questionnaires , electronically (as with K -SADS -COMP),  or obtained using the 
Comprehensive Health and Decision Informa tion System (CHADIS). K-SADS -COMP  was 
SHORT TITLE: ATX -PBPK -PD-Clinical Outcomes (U54)  
 
Page 48 of 143 developed using Microsoft ASP.NET 4.0 framework and  Microsoft SQL Server 2016 
database. These platforms are stable, reliable and secure. CHADIS  is a secu re web -based 
patient questionnaire tool to assist healthcare professionals with their patient  clinical 
care decisions. Parents and caregivers of the study participant are able to complete 
certain questionnaires online. These results are then imported into the participant’s 
electronic medical record.  
 
The Intake Visit  with Study Physician  takes place in the Developmental and Behavioral 
Health Sciences Clinic at the Adele Hall campus, the ADHD Clinic on College Boulevard, 
or via telehealth . During this visit, the participant and family undergo a routine standard 
of care visit with a study physician to confirm /infer  a diagnosis of ADHD, determine an 
ADHD subtype, assess for co -morbidities, perform a physical exam, and determine if ATX 
is an appropriat e therapy for the participant. If the Intake Visit occurs via telehealth, all 
in-person procedures may be omitted. Further details are described in section 11.2. The 
results from questionnaires will be reviewed. For participants without a formal diagnosis 
(i.e. documented on participant’s electronic medical record), questionnaires must be 
received from both parent and teacher.    
 
If the subject was seen by a study physician within 6 weeks  prior to enrollment and at 
baseline (meaning not taking any  ADHD medication), the visit does not need to be 
repeated in its entirety.  The study physician may amend his or her visit note in the EMR 
to document the following for research purposes:  
 
a. Confirm /infer  ADHD diagnosis  
b. Assess and confirm /infer  diagnosis of  other comorbidities  
c. Assess and confirm appropriateness of atomoxetine therapy for 
participant  
d. Complete Clinical Global Impression (CGI).  
 
After this, the Principle Investigator(s) (PI) will review information from these visits to 
determine if the particip ant meets all eligibility criteria.  
 
4. Intervention  assignment  
Once all inclusion and exclusion criteria have been assessed  during screening 
procedures, the PI will document that the subject meets all eligibility criteria to qualify 
for study participation .  The PI will then assign the participant to one of three  study 
designs based on his or her CYP2D6 activity score (see section 5.1).  The length and data 
collection  procedures of Research Visit 2, Research Visit 3, and Research Visit 4 will vary 
based on the participant’s CYP2D6 activity score , genotype , and frequency of dosing .  
During the course of  the study following Research Visit 2, some study particpants may 
be changed from the usual once daily dosing to twice a day  (bid)  dosing per their study 
physician .  These participants initially assigned to Study Design 2 may  require switching 
to Study Des ign 3 as determined by the research team to capture pharmacokinetic data 
SHORT TITLE: ATX -PBPK -PD-Clinical Outcomes (U54)  
 
Page 49 of 143 of non-Q12-hour  bid dosing.   Additionally, Study Design 3 participants taking twice daily 
dosing may be switched back to daily dosing  over the course of the study , thus 
necesaitating assignment back to Study Design 2.   Given the decreased drug clearance 
of poor metabolizers, particpants in Study Design 1 are not anticipated to be prescribed 
bid dosing and thus would not require switchin g to Study Design 3.   These length 
variations are illustrated in Figure 5 below. Data collection procedure variations are 
illustrated in the specific visit descriptions in section 11.2.

Figure 5  – Please note, visit length is expressed in hours post -drug administration.  
 
After study design assignment, the participant will begin the study intervention 
procedures, starting with Research Visit 2. See below for a brief description of each visit.  
 
Research Visit 2  – This visit is also referred to as pharmacokinetic study 1 (PK 1), or first 
dose PK. This visit takes place  in the PCRU and also includes  procedures  occurring  in 
preparation of this visit, in addition to procedures occurring after  administration 
of the first dose  of ATX.  
 
Research Visit 3  – This visit is also referre d to as pharmacokinetic study 2 (PK2) or steady 
state PK .  This visit takes place  in the PCRU and also includes procedures  occurring  in 
preparation of this visit, in addition to procedures  after administration of medication 
when the participant is at steady -state . Steady -state is assumed to have been achieved 
once the  participant has been taking atomoxetine routinely for two weeks.   This visit 
may occur any time after  the participant has been taking study drug rout inely for 2 
weeks and prior to the 18 -Week Visit with Study Physician .  If the participant is 
prescribed non-Q12-hour twice daily dosing at this time, the study team will notify 
paritipant and/or family prior to visit , and the participant will be switched to Study 
Design 3  for this research visit .  Compliance will be documented by checking the capsule 
count against the medication calendar and documented in corresponding CRFs.  
Additionally, study personnel will reach out participants and/or their families ~1  week 
SHORT TITLE: ATX -PBPK -PD-Clinical Outcomes (U54)  
 
Page 50 of 143 prior to remind them that all medications need to be taken in the week prior to 
Research Visit 3. Study personnel will call prior to Research Visit 3 to ensure that 
participants have been compliant for a week.   
  
6-Week Visit  with Study Physician  – The participant and family meet with a study 
physician approximately 6 weeks after ATX therapy was initiated. A ± 2 -week window is 
allowed for ease of scheduling  and to ensure Research Visit 3 occurs prior to the 
visit.  Prior to th is visit, questionnaires will be sent out via CHADIS to parents and 
teachers to assess participant’s behavior. During this visit, safety, efficacy , and side 
effects will al be assessed and dose adjustm ents will be made accordingly. Dose 
adjustments may be outside research and visits with study physicians as needed.   
 
12-Week Visit  with Study Physician  – The participant and family meet with a study 
physician approximately 6 weeks after the 6 -Week Visit with Study Physician. A ± 2 -
week window is allowed for ease of scheduling.   Prior to this visit, questionnaires will be 
sent out via CHADIS to parents and teachers to assess participant’s behavior. During this 
visit, safety, efficacy, and side effects will be assessed and dose adjustments will be 
made accordingly.  Dose adjustments may be outside research and visits with study 
physicians as needed.     
 
18-Week Visit  with Study Phys ician – The participant and family meet with a study 
physician approximately 6 weeks after the 12 -Week Visit with Study Physician. A ± 2 -
week window is allowed for ease of scheduling.  Prior to this visit, questionnaires will be 
sent out via CHADIS to parents and t eachers to assess participant’s behavior. During this 
visit, safety, efficacy, and side effects will be assessed and dose adjustme nts will be 
made accordingly. In addition, baseline questionnaires will be re -administered to gauge 
symptom and impairment changes post -treatment initiation. Dose adjustments may be 
outside research and visits with study physicians as needed.  
 
Research Visit 4  – This visit is also refe rred to as pharmacokinetic study 3 (PK3) or end of 
study PK .  This vist occurs after the 18 -Week Visit with Study Physician. This visit takes 
place  in the PCRU and consists of the same procedures  as Research Visit 3 . 
Determination of Study Design will be confirmed prior to visit, as some participants may 
require switching to a different study design if frequency of dosing has changed.  During 
this visit, baseline psychometric measures will be re -administered to measur e change 
post -treatment initiation.  An end of study EKG will be obtained , and a Dietary Survey 
Questionnaire will be administered.  
 
o Description of Research Procedures  
 
1. Research Visit 1  – Part 1  
a. When scheduling this visit, the research team will ensure that the 
participant and their family are aware of the safety measures at 
SHORT TITLE: ATX -PBPK -PD-Clinical Outcomes (U54)  
 
Page 51 of 143 Children’s Mercy Hospital to prevent transmission of the SARS -CoV-2 
virus. These resources and information to be shared will  be detailed 
on the Children’s Mercy Hospital homepage and any PCRU guidance 
in response to the COVID -19 pandemic . The research team will 
discuss with the participant and their family that safety procedures to 
reduce SARS -CoV-2 transmission will be in plac e for all in -person visits 
for the foreseeable future.  
b. Conduct permission/assent with participant and legally authorized 
representative (LAR), respectively. Obtain a signed and dated, written 
informed permission/assent form . 
i. If permission/assent conducted  via phone or virtually  prior to 
Research Visit 1 – Part 1 , ensure that original copy with 
participant and LAR is received prior to beginning research 
procedures.  
ii. Make a copy of all permission/assent forms for the participant 
and LA R. 
c. Obtain demographic da ta: age, gender, race.   
d. Obtain medical history, including prior surgeries.   
e. Obtain history of prior and concomitant medication.  Add to 
Concomitant and Prior Medications Log.  
f. Provide participants an d their families  the illustrated U54 Study 
Booklet that will be used to:    
i. Supplement the information about the study procedures given 
in the permission/assent form;   
ii. Record medication administration, and;   
iii. Detail answers to any questions they have about the study.  
iv. A questionnaire will be included with the book let asking 
families to evaluate how helpful the U54 Study B ooklet was in 
their understanding of the research study. The participant and 
their parents may also provide feedback for the U54 Study 
Booklet as well;  
v. Because this questionnaire and survey are a n ested study 
within the longitidunal study, p articipants and their families 
will also be given a handout ,  (please see supplemental 
document, “U54 Study Booklet Information Handout,”)  to 
explain  the purpose of the U54 Study Booklet, the purpose of 
the quest ionnaire, and  it describes that the responses to the 
booklet will be anonymous.  
vi. The U54 Study Booklet Information Handout serves as a 
permission/assent or consent document and the voluntary 
return of the questionnaire and survey serves as assumed 
permissio n/assent or consent.  
g. Provide handout explaining CHADIS . 
SHORT TITLE: ATX -PBPK -PD-Clinical Outcomes (U54)  
 
Page 52 of 143 h. Collect information regarding the participant’s comfort with 
needlesticks and ability to swallow pills.  Questions include:  
i. Parent impression about child’s anticipated comfort with 
needlestick  
ii. History of needlesticks  
iii. General fears about healthcare settings  
iv. Fears about unfamiliar situations  
v. Ability to swallow pills  
i. Collect blood sample for genotyping (~1 mL).   
i. The study team may order topical lidocaine ( which for this 
study refers to either  a J-tip or cream) if the study participant 
requests this for procedures requiring a needlestick.  
j. For enrolled participants  where a washout is needed prior to 
beginning atomoxetine:   
i. A washout will only be considered  for participants  currently 
taking  stimulant medication for ADHD. Examples of this 
include methylphenidate or amphetamine salts.  
ii. A study physician  or qualified study personnel will determine  
if the washout may be conducted safely . If so,  he or she will 
document  approval of the washout  on associated CRF . If this 
conversation occurs via telehealth, the study physician or 
qualified study personnel may document the conversation 
electronically and send an approval via email. The CRF and 
email will be printed and stor ed in the participant’s binder. 
Persons who are able to approve a washout will be identified 
in the Delegation of Authority/Roles.  
iii. Once the washout has been approved, study personnel will 
review the washout plan with the participant. Study personnel 
will: 
1. Document any questions or concerns that the 
participant and family have regarding washout.   
2. Document participant and family’s understanding and 
willingness to complete washout.   
3. Educate families on who to call if issues arise during 
washout. See “Washout Handout” in Supplementary 
Documents.  
4. Educate families to restart on medications (particularly 
if participant was on stimulants) if behaviors while off 
medication could cause risk to the participant.   
iv. A 1-week washout period of at least one week is sufficient for 
children taking stimulants.  
v. If the child is unable to washout of medication  or the study 
physician does not approve the washout’s safety, they will be 
removed from the study.

Page 53 of 143 vi. Schedule Research Visit 1 – Part 2 after washout period is 
anticipated to be completed.  
k. If it is determined that the participant was previously taking and 
subsequently discontinued  any of the following medications (see 
below) prior t o notification of study opportunity , an appropriate time 
to administer baseline questionnaires and to begin ATX  interv ention  
must be determined.  
i. ADHD medication other than a stimulant , e.g. ATX or α 2-
agonists  
ii. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Transporter Inhibitor (SSRI)  
iii. Selective Serotonin/Norepinhephrine Reuptake Transporter 
Inhibitor (SNRI)  
iv. Any medication that could reasona bly be expected to affect 
neurotransmitter concent rations, such as anxiolytics, 
antiepileptics,  antipsychotics.  
v. A CYP2D6 inhibitor  
vi. The following table will be used as guidance for when to 
administer baseline questionnaires  (i.e. return to baseline 
neurotra nsmitter levels  and/or behavior ) and when to begin 
ATX therapy  (i.e. drug and/or active metabolites excreted 
from participant) . However, this only addresses the most 
common medications that children with ADHD or behaviorial 
concerns are likely to be trialed on.  
1. The time indicated in “Medication Washout Interval,” 
is the minimum amount of time needed for medication 
to be removed  and thus, the amount of time needed 
before beginning ATX intervention.  
2. Administering baseline questionnaires rel ates to  
estimating when the participant is likely to return to 
baseline behavior, which could be longer than the time 
needed for drug to be removed from systemic 
circulation. When it is noted that the, “length of 
pharmacodynamic effects can be variable,”  the 
research team must rely on parent, teacher, and or 
participant report of symptoms and function. 
Evaluation of the participant’s medication chart may 
be also assessed for this information.  
vii. A detailed literature sea rch must be conducted for 
medications not  listed here. The process by which this occurs 
will be described in more detail in Appendix O.

drug administration.  After this 2 hour mark, the participant is free 
to eat and drink as desired. Document all meal times and content. 
Collect food receipts when available. The following are scenarios 
where the research team may deviate from fasting for 2 hours 
post -administration  
i. A participant may request to take atomoxetine with a 
small amount of soft food (e.g., pudding, applesauce, etc.) 
to aid with capsule swallowing. Document the food and 
approximate volume the participant used to a id with 
capsule swallowing (e.g., participant took capsule with ~1 
teaspoon of chocolate pudding).  
ii. If participant reports GI upset, a small snack may be given 
to alleviate symptoms, even in the event that the fasting 
time has not been completed. Document G I upset as an 
adverse event in the adverse events log. If snack is given, 
document the snack time and content  
iii. Fasting will not be required for participants taking 
medication in the evening  who are participating in an 
overnight pharmacokinetic study . The re search team does 
not believe it is feasible to expect a child to fast for 8 -12 
hours while awake.  
iv. If participant is assigned Study Design 3, fasting prior to 
and/or after the second dose of medication will not be 
required.  The research team does not belie ve it is feasible 
to expect a child to fast prior to both the first dose and 
second dose.  
u. Perform assessment of attention tasks (Pupillometry during 
Posner’s Cuing Task).  Further details can be found in Appendix H. 
v. Perform Tanner Staging. This procedure is optional according to 
participant preference.  The participant does not need to have 
Tanner Staging if this was performed previously within 4 weeks 
prior of Research Visit 3 or if the participant has already reached  
maximum stage in a prior Tanner staging exam.   
w. Assess for adverse events.  Document in Adverse Events log.   
x. Add compensation to participant’s Greenphire account.

participant is free to eat and drink as desired. Document all 
meal times and content. Col lect food receipts when available. 
The following are scenarios where the research team may 
deviate from fasting for 2 hours post -administration:  
i. A participant may request to take atomoxetine with a 
small amount of soft food (e.g. pudding, applesauce, etc. ) 
to aid with capsule swallowing. Document the food and 
approximate volume the participant used to aid with 
capsule swallowing (e.g. participant took capsule with ~1 
teaspoon of chocolate pudding).  
ii. If participant reports GI upset, a small snack may be give n 
to alleviate symptoms, even in the event that the fasting 
time has not been completed.  Document GI upset as an 
adverse event in the adverse events log. If snack is given, 
document the snack time and content.  
iii. Fasting will not be required for participants taking 
medication in the evening  who are participating in an 
overnight pharmacokinetic study . The research team does 
not believe it is feasible ot expect a child to fast for 8 -12 
hours while awake.  
iv. If participant is assigned Study Design 3, fasting prior t o 
and/or after the second dose of medication will not be 
required.  The research team does not believe it is feasible 
to expect a child to fast prior to both the first dose and 
second dose.

 1 Execution of permission/assent may occur via phone to allow participants to fill out psychometric questionnaires.  
2 Heart and blood pressure to take with each blood draw.  
3 These events occur prior to the visit for preparation.  
4 These phone calls occur in 2 parts.  
5 These questionnaires must be completed by the Intake Visit; however, they may be assigned at Research Visit 1 to allow partic ipants ample  
time to complete.   
6 For participants recruited from Track 4, these questionnaires are assigned immediately after c onsent has been obtained.  
7 For participants who require a taper off medication.   
*These visits will occur in the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit (PCRU) . 
ψThese visits will occur at either the ADHD Clinic on College Boulevard or in the Developmental and B ehavioral Sciences Clinic.  If these visits are 
telehealth visits, all in -person procedures, such as obtaining vitals or a physical exam, may be omitted.  
ϴThis visit can occur in two parts to minimize time of washout.  
€The window for this visit is flexible and has been expanded from the previous versions of this protocol. This visit can occur anytime after the 
participant has been taking medication regularly for 2 weeks and up until prior to the 18 -Week Visit with Study Physician.

 o Procedures to Reduce Risks   
1. Medical Chart Review during Prescreen will be used to determine if a 
potential participant has any of the following:  
a. Diagnosis or indication of underlying risk for cardiotoxicity, 
such as presentation of structural cardiac abnormalities, 
cardiomyopathy, or arrhythmias.   
b. Diagnosis or indication of disease that may cause abnormal 
absorption or gastric emptying.   
c. Previous history or indication of prior adverse drug reaction to 
atomoxetine   
d. Concurrent therapy with drugs known to inhibit CYP2D6 or 
previous treatment with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors.  
e. Concurrent therapy with other psychiatric/behavioral drugs  
2. The two parts of Research Visit 1 may occur at separate times  for 
participants who require a washout prior to beginning atomoxetine 
therapy. Research Visit 1 Part 1 includes a blood stick for genotyping 
purposes. Genotyping analysis, which takes approximately one week 
to complete and interpret, will be conducted while the participant is 
washing out. Were we to collect genot yping sample when the 
participant is at baseline, the participant could potentially be off of 
medication for ~ 2 weeks, while waiting for genotyping results such 
that ATX can be dosed in the participant using the iGO-PK model.   
3. Needlestick comfort and pill-swallowing ability questions will be 
asked to reduce discomfort and anxiety associated with needlesticks 
and taking the study drug.  
4. Baseline electrocardiogram during Research Visit 1 to assess presence 
of any underlying risks for cardiotoxicity prior to starting participant 
on ATX.    
5. End of study electrocardiogram during Research Visit 4 to assess for 
any cardiac injury that may have occurred while the participant was 
taking ATX chronically.   
6. Safety Labs – CBC with differential, hepatic function test, basic 
metabolic panel, and urinary analysis with microbiology will be 
conducted at Research Visit 1, Research Visit 2, Research Visit 3, and 
Research Visit 4 . 
7. Pregnancy Test will be conducted at Research Visit 1, Research Visit 2, 
Research Visit 3, and Res earch Visit 4 to ensure the subject is not 
pregnant.  
8. Assessment  of adverse events   
9. For blood collection:   
ATX PBPK -PD Clinical Study  
IRB # 16100728  
Page  84 of 143 
 a. Blood will be obtained either through needle stick (Research 
Visit 1) or through an indwelling venous catheter (Research 
Visit 2, Research Visit 3, and Research Visit 4).   
b. With our study design, the maximal amount of blood drawn 
from any participant for clinical and research purposes for a 
research visit  assigned Study Design 1 or 2  is 54 mL in a 72 
hour period. This would mean that the lower limit fo r weight 
to complete study procedures is 11 – 15 kg. Our study 
population typically exceeds this weight range. However, 
given that there a re multiple research visits where blood is 
drawn, for younger child and for those who are approximately 
11- 15 kg, we will schedule research visits such that they are 
greater than 30 days a part.   
c. For subjects who are less than 16.5 kg, the total amount of 
blood drawn from the subjects may exceed the 3 ml/kg/day 
limit, particularly if the individual is a CYP2D6 intermedia te or 
poor metabolizer. The maximum amount of blood drawn 
within a 24 hour  period is 48 mL.  
d. With our study design, the maximal amount of blood drawn 
for a participant for clinical and research purposes for a 
research visit assigned Study Design 3 is 75ml in a 24 hour 
period.   The majority of patients will not be enrolled under 
Study Design 3. The lower limit of weight to complete all 
possible blood draws for Study Design 3 is 15kg – 25kg (3 -
5ml/kg = 75ml).  Our study population typically exceeds this 
weigh t range.  Additionally, participants in Study Design 3 may 
not be required to have all blood draws adding up to 75ml, as 
the number of draws depends on the timing of their dosing.    
e. For Study Design 3 subjects who are less than 25 kg, research 
visits will be scheduled to not exceed predicted blood draw 
totals of 9.5ml/kg or more over an 8 week period.   
10. Incidental findings which are discovered during the course of  this 
study may be released to families in a letter at their request for the 
purposes of seeking further care (please refer to Appendix M). 
11. During the COVID -19 pandemic, the research team will make every 
attempt to reduce the number of in -person procedures  while 
providing ADHD care to the participant and achieving the aims of this 
research study.  
12. The research team will adhere to all Children’s Mercy Hospital and 
Children’s Mercy Research Institute guidelines for reducing 
transmission of SARS -CoV-2 virus . 
13. The research team will ensure that participants and their LARs have 
resources for reducing SARS -CoV-2 virus tranmission from Children’s 
Mercy Hospital and Children’s Mercy Research Institute.

11.5 Continuing Care   
Additional clinical  ADHD  care will be at the discretion of the study physician , 
participant, and participant’s family. This  may include, but is not limited to, the 
following: 1) immediate transition of atomoxetine prescribing to the primary 
care physician or other specialist iden tified by the family, 2) continuation of 
atomoxetine prescribing and follow -up care by the study physician, 3) 
discontinuation or weaning of atomoxetine when deemed clinically 
appropriate.    If the participant ’s ADHD care will be transitioned to their prim ary 
care provider or another community provider . A letter describing the course of 
the participant’s care in the research trial will be provided to the family and the 
care provider. (See “End of Study ADHD Care Transition Letter” in the Appendix 
N) 
 
11.6 IBC 
 
The following IBC protocols will be used in this study:  
• IBC Protocol #18 -27  “Processing of Blood, Urine, Saliva, and 
Cerebral Spinal Fluid Samples from Clinical/Research Studies in 
the Clinical Pharmacology Research Laboratories”  
• IBC Protocol #18 -10  “Processing of Blood, Saliva, and Urine 
Samples from Clinical/Research Studies in the Pediatric Clinical 
Research Unit”  
12.0 Data and S ample  Banking  
• Data Banking Procedures:  All data collected on study related CRFs and 
participant data on the EMR assessing participant outcomes  (in 
ATX PBPK -PD Clinical Study  
IRB # 16100728  
Page  88 of 143 
 particular, participant safety, efficacy, and toxicity)  will serve as sourc e 
documents for this study. For ease of analysis and logistics  of sharin g data 
with the study team members , a subset of the complete dataset that are 
pertinent to assessing the research aims will be entered in a REDCap 
database. This is currently being developed and is tentatively titled, “U54 
Longitudinal Atomoxetine – Clinic al Outcomes 2.0.”  All study personnel , 
research associates,  and U54 collaborators  may have access to the data, 
however on a need to know basis.  
 
• Sample Storing  Procedures :  Sample s will be stored in –80 
degree  C freezers housed within the department of Clinical 
Pharmacology,  Toxicology, and Therapeutic Innovation. These samples 
will be kept and stored  here until all  data analysis is complete and 
all findings  from this research study  have  either been finalized or 
published.  All study per sonnel , research associates,  
and U54 collaborators  may have access to the s ample s.  Following 
completion of this study and processing of all samples, these samples will 
be moved to the Pharma cokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) 
Repository  (see the correspon ding  bullet point  below ) 
 
 
• Procedures to release data or s ample s: Researchers within Children’s 
Mercy Hospital, or their collaborators, who may find these  data and/or  
specimens useful to answering  future  research questions may submit a 
written request to the PI of this study (in the event that data analysis and 
collection are still occurring) or the PI of the PK/PD Repository (following 
study completion) . Permission wi ll be granted by written letter by the 
respective principal investigator(s)  (Appendix K). The distribution of data 
and/or samples will be facilitated by the PI and study personnel in the 
event that data and samples are shared prior to the conclusion of this  
study. Following the conclusion of this study and transfer to the PK/PD  
repository, release of data and specimens are the responsibility of the 
PK/PD Repository PI and Manger and will follow the protocol 
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics Repository (IRB# TBD).   
 
 
• Transfer to th e Pharmacokine tics/Pharmac odyna mics (PK/PD) 
Reposit ory:  Following conclusion of this study , samples will be 
transferred to the Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics Repository  
which will be maintained by  the Children’s Research Institute 
Biorepository (CRIB) . The Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics 
Repository will be an identified repository which is comprised of clinical 
data, research data , and biological s amples (e.g. blood, urine, tissue 
ATX PBPK -PD Clinical Study  
IRB # 16100728  
Page  89 of 143 
 samples, etc.) that may be used prospectively to answer research 
questions  relating to pediatric clinical pharmacology . The data distributed 
for prospective future rese arch will be de -identifed by CRIB personnel as 
is described in the  PK/PD Repository protocol (IRB # TB D). 
 
 
• Samples from minors, plan for re -contacting and obtaining consent:  The 
study population will include minors whose samples will be retained for 
long term research. The permission/assent and consent forms for this 
study will provide participants wi th the option of allowing retention of 
their samples and data in the PK/PD Re pository for prospective future 
studies. If the participant turns 18 at the time of data collection , the 
participant will be reconsented. If the participant turns 18 after data 
collection has taken place, no attempt shall be made to recontact the 
participa nt (see section 25.0).  
 
 
13.0 Genetic Analysis Information  
• Genome -wide analysis and single nucleotide  polym orphism  (SNP)  analysis 
will be conducted on participant samples.   
 
• We do not expect to discover  paternity findings, as we are not enrolling 
trios in this study. However, given that we are assaying for genetic 
variants in biochemical  pathways  that affect neurotransmitter levels and 
activity, it is possible that  findings may be made regarding 
other  diseases. In particular, findings  may be made w here there is 
significant overlap between ADHD and the  disease in question, such as 
autism or anxiety.     
 
 
• Genetic testing (microarray SNP analysis , PCR sequencing, etc. ) to 
determine ATX dose and study design will not be conducted in a CLIA -
certified lab . Genome -wide testing will be conducted at the Children’s 
Mercy Hospital Genome Center, which is CLIA -certified.  Additional testing 
may be conducted should more information regarding genes associated 
with  ATX pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and clinical  outcomes 
become available. The assays may be conducted in either the Clinical 
Pharmacology laboraties or at the Genome Center, depending on assay 
availability.

 14.0 Sharing of Results with Subjects  
• Sharing Results with  Participants : Results  from genetic testing 
of pharmacogenes , such as,  CYP2D6,  CYP2C19, CYP2B6 , etc.  will be 
shared with participants  and their families.  In particular,  CYP2D6   genetic 
information will be pertinent to research participants as 
this result  determines  the duration of  Research Visit 2, Research Visit 3, 
and Research Visit 4. CYP2C19  data will also be shared given the number 
of available medication guidelines written for this pharmacogene. Should 
additional actionable pharmacogene information become availabl e 
during the course of this study, further information may be shared with 
the family. Genetic information  will be explained in a letter ( Appendix L ) 
to the participant/ family . The letter will state that the genotyping 
information  obtained from th is study are research results that are used 
to achieve the research goals  of this study. These results were obtai ned 
from our research lab which does  not adhere to CAP/CLIA guidelines. 
Because of this, t hese results cannot be included in t he participant’s  
medical record and should not be used to make medical  decisions . The 
research team  will inform  participants/families that the Genotype - and 
Ontogeny Linked Dose Individualization and Clinical Optimization for Kids 
(GOLDILOKs) Clinic  can fa cilitate obtaining  genetic testing that is 
CAP/CLIA certified at the expense of the participant.  Additonally , the 
GOLDILOKs Clinic can  interpret the genetic result s obtained from 
CAP/CLIA labs  for the participant and their families. The  results obtained 
by the GOLDILOKs clinic can be documented in the participant’s medical 
record  for future medical decision -making .  This practice complies with 
the CRI Policy and Procedure, “Research Documentation in the Electronic 
Health Record” approved on 09/26/2019.  
 
• Sharing Incidental Findings with Participants:  Incidental findings that a 
discovered during the course of this study may be released to 
participants and their families for the purposes of seeking further care 
(Appendix M). 
 
 
• Sharing  Results with Providers : Participant results from genetic testing 
of pharmacogenes  will be documented in the EMR if the family  requests 
a referral to the GOLDILOKs Clinic for further interpretation of genetic 
results. However, this note will include  a statement that the se dat a were

 16.0 Withdrawal of Subjects  
 
16.1 Anticipated circumstances in which subjects will be withdrawn from the 
research  study   
• Participant experiences a serious adverse event and there 
is a probable association between the serious adverse 
event and study drug and/or research procedures.  
• Participant experiences an adverse event, and there is a 
high probability of an association between the adverse 
event and study drug and/or research procedures and the 
adverse event interferes significantly with the participant’ s 
well-being (e.g. daily stomach aches).  
• Participant requires care beyond what the research study 
team can provide  while still meeting eligibility criteria  (e.g. 
participant requires medication for tics  that interferes will 
study drug ). 
• Participant is lost  to follow -up. 
• Participant is not compliant with study procedures.  
• Participant revokes consent/assent.  
• Participant no longer meets inclusion/exclusion criteria 
(e.g. abnormal safety labs).  
• Participant does not have adequate response from ATX at 
12-week visit and 18 week visit ( <10% reduction in 
symptoms).  
The PI may remove the participant from the study without the LAR’s 
permission or participant’s consent/assent if the above circumstances 
occur.  
 
16.2 Procedures for orderly termination /subject w ithdrawal  
1. PI, Study Physician , or individual designated in the Delegation 
of Authority will contact the study participant and their family . 
a. If the participant initiates the withdrawal, reasons will 
be documented and if applicable, intervention or plans 
for follow -up will made.   
b. If the stu dy team terminates the subject ’s participation 
in the study , study personnel will clearly explain the 
reasons for removal from the study and if applicable, 
ATX PBPK -PD Clinical Study  
IRB # 16100728  
Page  93 of 143 
 discuss next steps for necessary interventions or plan 
for follow -up care (e.g titration schedule for 
discontinuing study drug, etc).  
2. If applicable, adverse ev ents related to withdrawal will be 
promptly reported to the IRB per CM Policy 5.11 “Reportable 
Events”. Adverse events will continue to be followed until 
resolution.  
3. Study personnel will c omp lete end -of-study and withdrawal 
documentation  in the subject bin der. 
4. All previously collected samples and data, regardless of 
whether participant completed the research study in its 
entirety, will be saved for data analysis.  
5. Transfer of care procedures from the study physician to the 
participant’s primary care provider  will take place in 
accordance with those outlined in section 11.6 for participants 
completing the study in its entirety.  
 
 17.0 Risks to Subjects  
• Confidentiality Risk:   There is a risk of loss of 
confidentiality. Confidentiality will be protected to the 
greatest extent possible. There is also a risk of loss of 
confidentiality when using the internet. This is especially 
pertinent when filling out questionnaires using a w eb 
interface. The study team will make every effort to protect 
the participant’s confidentiality such that this risk is 
minimal.  
 
• Blood Draw:  Risks of drawing blood include discomfort and/or 
bruising. A needlestick can be greater than minimal risk. However, 
numbing spray and topical  lidocaine can be provided to minimize 
pain associated with needle sticks.   In addition, the study team 
will inqui re about needlestick fears and comfort techniques prior 
to the first needlestick.  
 
 
• Allergic reaction:  It is possible to have an allergic reaction to 
atomoxetine. Currently, there is no way to predict whether an 
individual will have an allergic reaction t o atomoxetine a priori . 
However, the percentage of individuals experiencing allergic 
reaction is low. The first dose of atomoxetine will be administered 
ATX PBPK -PD Clinical Study  
IRB # 16100728  
Page  94 of 143 
 to the participant in the PCRU. Medications and procedures are in 
place should a participant have an al lergic anaphylactic reaction 
to atomoxetine.  
 
 
• Genetic Risks: The unauthorized disclosure of genetic information 
may have an impact on a participant’s employability, insurability, 
immigration status, paternity suits, or social reputation. These 
risks inclu de the chance of discrimination. The study team will 
make every effort to protect the participant’s genetic such that 
this risk is minimal. Additionally, the genes investigated in the 
study have thus far only been associated with drug 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The risk of 
discrimination with this type of genetic information is lower 
compared to genes linked to predisposition of disease.  
 
 
• Side Effects Risks:  Participants may experience side effects of 
atomoxetine related to the way the medication is dosed. Typical 
side effects include increased heart rate, headache, stomach 
upset, nausea, sleepiness, and emotional lability. In addition, 
there are reports of s uicidal ideation with atomoxetine use. The 
level of risk is variable given that the severity of side effects can 
be different among participants.  
 
 
• Psychological Risks : There may be psychological risks associated 
with answering questions about the partici pant’s mood and 
behaviors at home and at school. The level of risk in answering 
psychological questionnaires would be equal to an individual 
seeing care for ADHD and comorbidities associated with ADHD, as 
many of these questionnaires are used to assess sym ptoms and 
improvement. We therefore expect the psychological risks to pose 
no increase in psychological risks over baseline.  
 
 
18.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects  
 
• Personalized Medication Dosing : Participants will receive more personalized 
dosing of atomox etine therapy t hrough participation in study . 
 
ATX PBPK -PD Clinical Study  
IRB # 16100728  
Page  95 of 143 
 • Genetic Information : Participants will have genetic information returned to 
them (as it is related to duration of study visits) and will be given information 
about the GOLDILOKs Clinic at Children Mercy’s Hospital where they can learn 
about the impact that their unique genet ic information has on the way their 
body processes ATX and numerous other medications.  As mentioned 
previously in section 14.0, it will be explained to families that genetic testing 
results obtained as part of the study cannot be used by GOLDILOKs Clinic for 
interpretation, but rather, that the testing will need to be repeated in a CLIA -
certified lab.  If the participant and/or family would like to be seen in 
GOLDILOKs Clinic and repeat genetic testing, these services will not be paid for 
by the study and will be the responsibility of the participant/family.

 20.0 Data Management  
 
20.1 Data Analysis Plan  
Population to be Analyzed:  
• The pharmacokinetic population will consist of all participants with 
sufficient plasma concentrations for calculation of all pharmacokinetic 
parameters.  
• The pharmacodynamic population will comprise of all patients with 
sufficient DHPG plasma concentration s, adequate data from pupil dilation 
and eye -tracking measurements, and cardiovascular measures (heart rate 
and blood pressure).  Additional metabolites analyzed via metabolomics 
platform will also be analyzed (as discussed below).  
• All participants who meet  criteria for determination of both 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters and have at least 
partially completed the study will be evaluated for pharmacodynamic 
linked clinical outcomes analysis. A partial completion is any participant 
where at lea st Research Visit 1, Research Vist 2, Research Visit 3, Intake 
Visit with Physician, and 6 -week Visit with Study Physician have been 
completed. Clinical outcomes will be analyzed in four ways:  
o Response: responder vs. non -responder  
o Toxicity: tolerant vs. non -tolerant  
o Adherence : low, medium, and high  
o Adverse event reporting    
• In addition, all participants for which demographic and background 
characteristics and concomitant medication history were collected  will be 
analyzed.  
• All completed and returned U54 Study B ooklet questionnaires and 
surveys will be used to assess the effectiveness of the U54 Study B ooklet 
in study comprehension. Feedback from the survey will be compiled for 
analysis.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters and generation of the statistical 
analyses on the PK parameters will be performed by The Division of Clinical 
Pharmacology Toxicology & Therapeutic Innovation at the Children’s Mercy 
Hospital, Kansas City, MO. P harmacokinetic analyses will be conducted using 
KineticaTM version 5.0 (ThermeElectron, Philadelphia, PA). Plasma ATX 
concentration versus time data will be curve fit using a peeling algorithm to 
generate initial polyexponential parameter estimates. Final parameter estimates 
will be determined from an iterative, nonlinear weighted least squares 
regression algorithm with reciprocal (1/y2calc) weighting. Model -dependent 
pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated from final polyexponential 
parameter estimat es. Final model selection will be performed by evaluating the 
ATX PBPK -PD Clinical Study  
IRB # 16100728  
Page  97 of 143 
 goodness -of-fit criteria including; the objective function, Akaike & Schwartz 
criteria, standard deviations and coefficients of variation for the polyexponential 
parameters estimates and the cor relation matrix detailing the degree of 
interdependence between the parameter estimates for each model. In the event 
that an insufficient number of post -peak ATX plasma concentration time points 
are available, a model -independent approach will be used and parameters of 
interest calculated using standard techniques.  Specifically, C max and T max will be 
obtained by direct examination of the plasma concentration versus time profile.  
The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve during the sampling 
period (AUC 0-n) will be calculated using the mixed log -linear rule and 
extrapolation of the AUC to infinity (AUC 0-∞) calculated by summation of AUC 0-n 
+ Cp n/λz, where Cp n represents the final plasma concentration predicted from 
the fitted apparent terminal elimination phase and λ z is the apparent terminal 
elimination rate constant. Model -inde pendent pharmacokinetic parameters will 
then be calculated using standard (i.e., statistical moment theory) techniques. 
ATX metabolites N-desmethylatomoxetine (NDM -ATX), 4 -hydroxyatomoxetine 
(4-OH-ATX) and hydroxyl -2-carboxylatomoxetine (OH -2-COOH -ATX) 
pharmacokinetics will be evaluated in a fashion analogous to that described for 
the parent compound.  
 
The following PK parameters will be derived by non -compartmental analysis 
from plasma concentration data following a single dose study drug 
administration:  
 
Cmax  Peak plasma concentration determined from the observed data  
Tmax Time to observed maximum drug concentration  
AUC 0-τ Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, 
determined by log -linear trapezoidal estimation, to the 12 or 24

design).  
AUC 0-∞  Area under the concentration versus time curve to infinity, 
determined by log -linear trapezoidal estimation AUC 0‑τ + C T/k 
Where k is the elimination rate constant defined as the negative  
slope following maximum concentration determined by least 
squares regression from terminal phase data.

iGO-PK Model Update : The current iGO -PK Mode l (Version 1.0) uses  ATX 
pharmacokinetic data from 24 pediatric participants  (Brown et al., 2016) . Since 
the building of Version 1.0, more ATX pharmacokinetic data has been collected 
from studies conducted at Children’s Mercy Hospital (IRB# 16010069) and this 
current study. The data will be used to update and refine the iGO -PK model 
when it has been determined that sufficient new data has been collected. This 
determinination will be made by the Principal Investigators and other Co -
Investigators.  
 
Pharmacodynamics:  
Estimation of the pharmacodynamics parameters and gene ration of statistical 
analyses will be performed by The Division of Clinical Pharmacology , Toxicology  
& Therapeutic Innovation at the Children’s Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, MO. An 
indirect model of pharmacodynamic changes, using change in plasma DHPG as a 
function of systemic plasma ATX concentration will be evaluated using Phoenix 
NLME (Certara, Princet on, NJ, USA), NONMEM (Icon, Dublin, Ireland), MATLAB 
(Natick, MA, USA), SAS version 9.4 (SAS, Cary, NC, USA), and R (The R 
Foundation). Concentration changes in DHPG as a function of change in systemic 
ATX levels will be fit to an indirect model (Equation A). Pharmacodynamic 
parameters k in, kout, Imax, and IC 50 will be estimated for each metabolite studied 
using a nonlinear mixed effects model to take into account variability of 
pharmacodynamic marker change within the study population. Statistical 
regressi on models will be constructed to determine which patient covariates are 
ATX PBPK -PD Clinical Study

Page  99 of 143 
 predictive of pharmacodynamic response. A maximal effect (E max) model 
describing the relationship between ATX concentration and pharmacodynamic 
effect will also be assessed in this stu dy (Equations B and C). Models will be 
compared using statistical tests (Sum of Squares, Loglikelihood, AIC, standard 
error of estimates, and distribution of residuals). Changes in ATX C max and AUC 0-¥ 
will also be plotted against pupillometry and eye -track ing data gathered when 
testing participants with localization and discrimination tasks. To describe the 
relationship between attentional orientating as function of ATX exposure, the 
data will be regressed both linearly and non -linearly and best of fit stat istics 
(Akaike Information Criteria and Bayesian Information Criteria) will be employed 
to determine the most appropriate model.

Rates of formation and elimination (k in and k out), maximal inhibition (I max), 
concentration at which 50% maximal inhibition is achieved (IC 50), maximal 
response (E max), and concentration at which 50% maximal response is achieved 
(EC 50) will be determined for all neurotransmitters assessed in the in the global 
neurotransmitter panel (see Appendix I for metabolite list).  The Dietary Survey 
Questionnaire and microbiome information from saliva samples will  be analyzed 
as possible covariates of the neurotransmitter profiles.  
 
Genetic Analysis:  Genome -wide analysis and single nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP) analysis will be conducted on participant samples. Genetic testing 
(microarray SNP analysis, PCR sequenci ng, etc.) will be conducted to characterize 
variants in genes involved in disposition and response of ATX. Some examples of 
genes that may affect drug disposition and response include, but are not limited 
to, CYP2D6 , CYP2C19 , ABCB1 , and SLC6A2 . Genes assoc iated with ADHD 
phenotype may also be analyzed , especially if ATX response (or lack thereof), is 
associated with a particular sub -population of individuals with ADHD. Additional 
testing may be conducted should more information become available regarding 
genes that may affect the prescribed drug’s pharmacokinetic profile, 
pharmacodynamic characteristics, or clinical outcomes (i.e. safety, efficacy, or 
toxicity). Information on variants will be analyzed to determine impact on ATX 
safety, efficacy, or toxicity . 
Pupillometry Analysis:  
ATX PBPK -PD Clinical Study  
IRB # 16100728  
Page  100 of 143 
 Changes in performance during Posner Cuing Task will be measured as a function 
ATX exposure and C max concentrations. Pupil size will be measured during two 
types of activities: localization and discrimination tasks. Pupil size differences 
during localization tasks report on the individuals’ baseline (tonic) release of 
norepinephrine. This corresponds to endogenous, or volitional attention. Pupil 
size differences during discrimination tasks is a composite of the individuals’ 
baseline (tonic) and situational (phasic) release of norepinephrine. Currently it is 
unclear whether tonic, phasic, or both are impai red in individuals with ADHD.  
  
Cardiovascular Marker Analysis:  
Changes in heart rate will also be measured as a function ATX exposure and C max 
concentrations. One side effect of ATX that is directly related to the 
pharmacodynamics of the drug is an increased heart rate due to increased 
concentration of norepinephrine in blood. We would like to understand the 
extent of this side effect as a funct ion of increased systemic ATX exposure and 
Cmax. By studying these two components, we will be able to distinguish ATX drug 
action in central and peripheral nervous systems.  
 
Pharmacodynamic Changes Correlated with change in NICHQ Vanderbilt 
Assessment Scal es: 
All changes markers of pharmacodynamic action will be correlated with whether 
a child is classified as a responder or non -responder; and tolerant or intolerant 
(see Clinical Outcomes below for details). Extent of adherence will be used as a 
confounding  factor in both of these analyses.  
  
Clinical Outcomes:  
Determine and document participant response to ATX therapy:  
• Responders will be defined as:  
• Participants, who after approximately 18 weeks of continuous 
treatment with ATX, demonstrate ≥ 40% reduction  of baseline 
ADHD symptom score;  
• OR the Clinical Global Improvement rating is 1 or 2 (Very Much 
Improved or Much Improved).  
• Non -responders will be defined as:  
• Participants, who after approximately 18 weeks of continuous 
treatment with ATX, demonstrate < 40 % reduction of baseline 
ADHD symptom score, AND the Clinical Global Improvement score 
≥ 3. 
• Participants who discontinue ATX prior to the planned end of study 
(18 weeks) due to perceived lack of efficacy despite dose 
escalation.  
ATX PBPK -PD Clinical Study  
IRB # 16100728  
Page  101 of 143 
  
Determine and document part icipant tolerance of ATX therapy:  
• ATX intolerant participants are:  
• Participants who present with side -effects that significantly 
interfere with daily functioning or outweigh therapeutic benefit 
(CGI Efficacy Scale categorization)  
• Participants who must disc ontinue ATX for any of the following 
reasons: AST or ALT three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
for age, alkaline phosphatase five times the ULN, total bilirubin 
two times ULN, QT prolongation or dysrhythmia, hypertension 
(systolic or diastolic BP abo ve 95% for age), tachycardia (HR above 
95% for age)  
 
Parent and teacher responses for the NICHQ Vanderbilt Assessment Scales  will 
be obtained at baseline and ± 2 weeks of 6 -week  Visit with Study Physician , 12-
week  Visit with Study Physician, and 18 -week Visit  with Stud y Physician. If 
questionnaires are returned outside of this window, or are unreturned, these 
will be conside red, “missing data .” Determination of response, i.e. responder vs. 
non-responder, will be do ne using parent responses to questionnaires. Teacher 
response to questionnaires will also be analyzed to evaluate symptom reduction 
in a secondary setting. Partial return of teacher questionnaires are still useful in 
that these data may be used to correct for bias in parental response.  
 
Questoinnaires conducted at baseline and at either 18 -week visit with Study 
Physician or a Research Visit will be analyzed for change pre - and post - 
intervention. These include: BRIEF – parent, SCT, SCARED, CBCL, and School 
Intervention Questionnaire.  
 
Statistical analyses of clinical response in the population studied will be 
performed by The Division of Health Services and Outcomes Research at the 
Children’s Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, MO. SAS version 9.4 (SAS, Cary, NC, U SA) 
and R (The R Foundation) will be used to determine if ATX responders and non -
responders can be differentiated by a subset of patient specific covariates. 
Variables that will be included in this analysis are data collected at the patient’s 
initial clini c visit: DHPG, SLC6A2  genotype, ADHD subtype, ADHD severity, co -
morbid anxiety or oppositional defiant disorder, age, and gender. Predictive 
power of classification models will be assessed by computing the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic c urve and/or by k -fold cross -validation. Two -
sample t -tests or non -parametric alternatives will be utilized to test for group 
differences in percent decrease in DHPG and a differences in proportions test 
will be used to assess the association between respon se and SLC6A2  genotype. 
In additional, global metabolomic analyses will be conducted to determine 
whether non -responders and responders are intrinsically different in their 
biochemical make -up. This will further understanding of how differences in 
ATX PBPK -PD Clinical Study  
IRB # 16100728  
Page  102 of 143 
 response  phenotype could be a result of different biological pathway 
involvement in ADHD.  Digital maps  will be constructed for partial least square -
discriminant analysis (PLS -DA) models with prior knowledge of which volunteers 
were categorized as responders and n on-responders. The variable influence on 
the projection (VIP) parameter will be used to identify which metabolites (i.e. 
pathways) are the most predictive of differentiating between the responder and 
non-responder populations. Analyses will also be conduct ed to determine 
mechanistic reasons for why certain individuals are non -responders or 
responders. Changes in pharmacodynamic endpoints will be compared between 
responders and non -responders. Specifically pharmacodynamic parameters such 
as I max, IC 50, diffe rences in pupil diameter changes in localizations and 
discrimination tasks, and overall change in DHPG will be compared between the 
two populations using MANOVA and/or appropriate two -sampl e test.  
 
ATX pharmacodynamic data for each SLC6A2  activity group wi ll be examined 
using standard descriptive statistics. Analysis of variance will be used to compare 
parameters between pre -defined genotype populations followed by application 
of the appropriate parametric or non -parametric post -hoc test to determine 
where inter -group differences occur. Linear and non -linear least squares 
regression analysis will be used to examine the correlation between DHPG fitted 
parameters and changes in eye -tracking and pupillometry differences in SLC6A2  
genotype groups. Univariate ana lysis of variance, nonlinear regression and 
analysis of covariance will be used to evaluate the relationship between 
demographic variables (alone or in combination) with corresponding 
pharmacodynamic parameter estimates.   All analyses will be performed in SPSS 
version 11.5 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) with the significance limit set at α=0.05. A sample 
size of 120 was deemed reasonable with the volume of patients being referred 
to the ADHD sub -specialty over a four year period. Powering of statistical tests 
was done  assuming 20% attrition and data simulated for 96 patients. Assuming 
that 30% of the participants completing the study are categorized as responders, 
an α = 0.05, and power = 80%, a mean difference in covariates assessed of 0.6 
standard deviations is detec table with a one -sided t -test. With zero attrition, the 
mean detectable difference in covariates of interest drops to 0.5 standard 
deviations.  
 
Study Comprehension:  
Responses to the U54 S tudy Booklet questionnaire will be summarized by 
frequency counts and percentages to each question asked. Improvement to the 
study booklet will be categorized by type of improvement suggested and 
summarized by frequency counts and percentages.   
  
Background and Demographic Characteristics : Background and demographic 
characteristics will be listed by participant. Continuous variables will be 
summarized by sample size (n), mean, median, standard deviation (SD), 
ATX PBPK -PD Clinical Study

 minimum, and maximum.  Discrete variables will be summ arized by frequencies 
and percentages.  
 
Concomitant Therapy : Descriptive statistics such as frequency counts and 
percentages of participants who use concomitant medications will be provided 
by therapeutic classification and specific therapy.   
 
20.2 Sample  Size Determination  
We hypothesize that there are at least two discrete ATX response phenotypes 
groups and additionally that these groups may be distinguished by differences in 
pharmacodynamic markers, and/or baseline patient characteristics. We will use 
two-sample t-tests (i f transformed data are approximately Gaussian) or 
appropriate non -parametric alternatives to test for group differences in baseline 
and maximal change in DHPG, and a difference in proportions test to assess 
association between response group and SLC6A2 gen otype. To estimate power 
for these tests we assumed 20% attrition and simulated data for 96 patients.   For 
a 30% response rate among study completers (a conservative estimate), α = 
0.05, and power = 80%, a mean difference of 0.6 SDs between responders and 
non-responders (eg, on DHPG) was detectable using a one -sided t-test.   With 120 
patients (zero attrition) a 0.5 SD difference was detectable.   Depending on the 
rate and nature of attrition and missing data we will consider non -response 
weighting or data im putation to reduce estimation bias and improve power. We 
assessed power for the difference in proportions test based on a 45% probability 
of a given patient having at least one SLC6A2 lower expression “T” allele ( i.e., 
frequency of  SLC6A2  -3081 AT and TT g enotypes ~45% based on a minor T allele 
frequency of 0.061 
(http://useast .ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Variation/Population?db=core;g=ENS
G00000103546;r=16:55655604 -

 Assuming a ttrition of 20% and a response rate of 30%, power was 81% to detect 
a 0.23 difference in allele frequency between responders and non -responders 
using a one -sided test.   With 120 patients a 0.20 difference was detectable with 
80% power.     
  
 While these an alyses are central to our hypothesis, we recognize that other 
plasma metabolites or genetic differences may contribute to varying drug 
response. A target metabolite panel will be assayed in each participant and 
statistical analyses of these will be analogo us to DHPG. A panel of genetic 
variants will also be analyzed for contribution to variable drug pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics, and clinical response in the same manner as the SLC6A2  
variant described above.

Mercy Hospital policy: Request Restrictions to Protected Health 
Information.  
 
22.2 At Ease  
The study team will allow the participant  and their families time  to decide 
whether he/she wants to  both  participate and continue in the study. 
Families are given at least a week to review the permission/assent forms 
before deciding whether to participate in this study. During enrollment, 
families are encouraged to ask questions and additionally, a 
supplemen tal illustrated booklet detailing study procedures is provided 
to the family. The study team will review the type of information that is 
being collected with the participant and their family. The participant and 
their family will also be asked at each rese arch visit whether they would 
like to continue to participate in the study.  
 
22.3 Permission to Access Data  
The study will follow standards established by the following Children’s 
Mercy Hospital  policies: Confidentiality; HIPAA & Privacy Manual 
Standard . 
 
22.4 PHI to be  Accessed

Page  107 of 143 
 22.5 HIPAA Authorization  
The study has a partial HIPAA waiver for the purposes of recruitment and 
prescreening (see section 9.0).  
23.0 Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
 
There is no compensation for research -related injury. Should illness or 
injury occur during participation in this study, treatment is available and 
will be provided at the usual charge. Payment for this treatment will be 
the responsibility of the  participant.  
24.0 Economic Burden to Subjects  
 
Participation in Resear ch Visit 1, Research Visit 2, Research Visit 3, and 
Research Visit 4 will not result in any extra cost to the participant or their 
parents aside from personal time and travel costs to come to these visits.   
 
Intake Visit  with Study Physician , 6-Week Visit with Study Physician  Visit, 
12-Week Visit  with Study Physician , and 18 -Week with Study Physician  
may incur extra costs to the participant or their families depending on 
their insurance plan. This is because the Study Physicians involved in the 
care of the participants are considered consultants and these visits with 
the Study Physician may be conside red as referrals to secondary care.  
25.0 Permission/Assent/Consent Process  
 
The research team will be obtaining permission and assent if the potential 
participant is younger than 18 years of age. Consent will be obtained if the 
potential participant is ove r 18 years of age and if the participant turns 18 during 
the study.   
 
• Permission/assent or consent may be conducted in person with the study 
team at the PCRU or this may take place over the phone.   
• The research team will wait at least for at least a period  of one week 
between informing the prospective subject and obtaining either 
permission/assent or consent.   
• Permission and assent will be reaffirmed prior to any research 
procedures take place at Research Visit 1, Research Visit 2, Research Visit 
3, and Res earch Visit 4.   
• This research study will be following the CM research policies regarding 
informed permission/assent/consent.   
• This research team  will be obtaining permission/assent/consent via 
telephone, and we will be following CM research policy  10.05 Te lephone 
Process regarding telephone consent.  
ATX PBPK -PD Clinical Study  
IRB # 16100728  
Page  108 of 143 
 • The permission/assent and consent forms will contain a section for 
participants to allow their data and samples to be stored in the PK/PD 
Repository for use in prospective research.  
 
Subjects Who Are Not Yet Adults  
 
Prospective subjects under the age of 18 are considered minors and have 
not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures 
involved in the research under the applicable law of the jurisdiction (the 
state of Missouri) in which the research will be conducted.     
 
• Parental permission need only be obtained from one parent even 
if the other parent is alive, known, competent, reasonably 
available, and shares legal responsibility for the care and custody 
of the child. Permission to partic ipate in the research study is 
done so by the potential participant’s legally authorized 
representative (LAR). LARs who are not the potential participant’s 
biological parents must provide documentation (e.g. adoption 
paperwork) prior to or at the time of t he permission/assent 
process. The study team will maintain a copy of these records as a 
part of the participant’s study binder. Assent will be obtained for 
all children greater than or equal to 7 years of age. For children 
under the age of 7, assent is not  required, but may be obtained at 
the discretion of the study team.   
 
• Documentation of both permission and assent will be recorded on 
study specific permission/assent forms and will be signed and 
dated by the parent or LAR and potential participant (if 
applicable). If potential participant is unable to sign, the study 
team will document the reason for this. If assent is not obtained 
for a child under 7, this will also be documented on the 
permission and assent form.   
 
  
Subjects Who Become Adults at 18 Years of Age At the Time of Data 
Collection  
 
Participants who turn 18 years old while actively participating in this 
study procedures will be consented at age 18 using a full Adult Consent 
form.   
 
Subjects Who Become Adults  at 18 Years of Age After Data Collection is 
Completed  
 
ATX PBPK -PD Clinical Study  
IRB # 16100728  
Page  109 of 143 
 The study is seeking a waiver of consent for participants who turn 18 
after data collection has been completed due to: the amount of time 
needed to complete enrollment for this study, study procedures , data 
processing, and data analysis (~ 5 years)  and the potential of not 
completing study procedures by the time many of the participants turn 
18; the fact that participants may move; or may not follow up ; and the 
high number of participants . This study c ould not be reasonably 
completed without a Waiver of Consent for children reaching the age of 
majority after study procedures have been completed.  
 
26.0 Documentation of Permission/Assent/Consent

Appendix A – ATX PBPK Model Validation Summary  
 
The primary aim of this study is to validate a method to individualize ATX dosing to 
achieve a desired level of ATX exposure, referred to as the individualized Genetic and 
Ontogenic Pharmaco kinetic (iGO -PK) algorithm. This dosing algorithm relies on two 
separate models, one that is used to dose CYP2D6 PMs and a model for the rest of the 
population (i.e., the non -PM model). This dosing algorithm has been designed to 
calculate a dose of ATX for individual patients that is expected to result in ATX C max 
conc entrations at steady -state associated with a reduction in ADHD symptoms 
(Michelson et al, 2007) The model takes into account CYP2D6 genotype, which is 
converted into an activity score, weight, and obesity status. Validation and refinement 
of this dose pred iction model is required to ensure that a C max goal can be achieved 
reliably with the patient information that is provided. Additionally, we are interested in 
obtaining more data for CYP2D6  Ims and PMs because of the small sample size in these 
phenotype gr oups in the initial pharmacokinetic study conducted by Brown et al (2016). 
The data collected from this study will also be used to refine the model, given that the 
initial model only utilized data from 23 children who represent a wide range of CYP2D6 
activ ity.

I am recruiting patients ages 6 -18 with suspected or diagnosed ADHD for a study with 
the medication Atomoxetine (Strattera) through Clinical Pharmacology/GOLDILOKs. 
Atomoxetine is an FDA -approved medication for ADHD, but its use has been 2nd or even 
3rd line for ADHD due to lack of efficacy. In our study, we are interested in using 
personalized medicine to tailor a dose to each patient to improve how this medication 
works for each child. In this lo ngitudinal study, patients interested in non -stimulant 
medication will receive personalized Atomoxetine dosing based on their CYP2D6 
genotype (the enzyme that breaks down the medication). Patients referred for this 
study will receive their  ADHD  care from a  study physician for the next 6 -8 months and 
have intermittent research visits in the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit (PCRU) at the 
Adele Hall campus to monitor how they are responding to and breaking down the 
medication. From this study, we hope to learn how to better use this medication for 
children with ADHD.  
 
After reviewing this patient ’s chart, he/she is eligible for the study, and I see he/she has 
an appointment  with you [timeframe] . If you, your patient, and his/her family are 
interested in st arting this medication, please feel free to mention there is an ADHD 
medication study available. If he/she and his/her parents are interested, please feel free 
to either give them my contact information below to call or email me , provide the study 
handout available in each provider workroom , or simply reply back and I will reach out 
to the family.  
 
If your patient is currently on an alpha agonist or atomoxetine for ADHD, unfortunately, 
he/she cannot enroll in our study. However, if your patient is currently  taking a 
stimulant  for ADHD , he/ she will need to undergo a 1 week washout period prior to 
starting the study medicaiton . Please note, the study team must first obtain 
permission/assent or consent prior to any study procedures, including initiating a 
medic ation washout.  
 
There is a slide regarding this study on the workroom monitors for you to refer to, but if 
you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out.

 Appendix C – ADHD Clinic RN  
 
Hi, my name is ____________ and I am a nurse/care provider at the Children’s Mercy 
Hospital ADHD Clinic.  
 
We reviewed the results from the questionnaires that you and your child’s teachers 
filled out. Based on the answers we received, w e believe that there is a high chance that 
your child may have attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (or ADHD for short). We 
would like to schedule an appointment for you to meet with our physician and clinical 
psychologist for further evaluation.  (NB: this italicized section about scheduling may be 
omitted if the caller has no intention to schedule an appointment.)  
 
Because your child has a high likelihood of having ADHD, he/she may be able to 
participate in an ADHD study that is taking place at Childre n’s Mercy Hospital.  
If you/your child might be are interested in participating in this study, or would like to 
learn more about this study, we would be more than happy to pass your contact 
information to the study coordinator of this study for more detail ed information.  
 
Would you be interested in this study, or would you like to learn more about this study?  
1. Yes, please have the study coordinator contact me with more information  
2. No, I am not interested in participating in the study at this time.

Appendix D – Study Coordinator/Research Assistant Recruitment Script  
 
Hi, my name is ___________, and I work in research at Children’s Mercy Hospital.  My 
team is working on an Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD, 
medication study for children ages 6 -18.  D o you have 5 -10 minutes to talk about a 
voluntary study opportunity?  
 
(If yes, continue.  If no, ask to contact at a later date/time.)  
 
Track 1  – I am contact ing parents of new patients with upcoming appointments at the 
Children’s Mercy ADHD Clinic on Coll ege Blvd to let you know about this study 
opportunity.  I see that your child has an upcoming appt on MM/DD/YYYY.  
 
Track 2  – Your child’s healthcare provider, _______, at PCC on Broadway, contacted me 
about your interest in our ADHD study.  
 
Track 3  – Your  child’s healthcare provider, _______, at  _________, contacted me about 
your interest in our ADHD study.  
 
(Track 4 and Track 5 contact us; this would be a return call or incoming call.)  
 
First, I’d like to tell you about what we are studying and why.  Then, if you are interested 
in learning more, I’ll share what would happen during the study.  First, please note that 
all research is voluntary, and your decision to participate or not will not affect the care 
your child receives here at Children’s Mercy i n any way.  Feel free to stop me at any 
time if you have questions while I explain the study.  
 
We are studying an ADHD medication, atomoxetine, (the brand is name is Strattera ), in 
children ages 6 -18 years old.  This study would involve your child taking t his medication.  
This medication is approved by the FDA for children with ADHD and has been on the 
market for about 15 -20 years.  It isn’t used very often though. This is because it doesn’t 
seem to work very well for some children.  For some children, they  behave much better 
in school and pay attention in class while taking this medicine.  However, for other 
children, it doesn’t seem to have much effect.  There are lots of reasons why a medicine 
might not work for someone, and one of those reasons is how fa st or slow they break 
down the medicine.  We think that perhaps one reason this medicine doesn’t work as 
well for some children is because the dose is too high or too low for how fast or slow 
they break it down.  What we would like to do is draw a small am ount of blood and run 
genetic testing to figure out how fast or slow your child breaks down the medicine.  
Together with other information such as age, weight, height, and ethnicity, we will come 
up with a dose that we think is just right for your child.  We would ask your child to take 
this medicine for several months and see if it helps treat his or her ADHD symptoms.  
There is a chance that this medicine will not work for your child regardless of the dose, 
ATX PBPK -PD Clinical Study  
IRB # 16100728  
Page  116 of 143 
 and this is because the dose is just one piece o f the puzzle.  We want to understand why 
this medicine works for some children and doesn’t for others.  Ultimately by studying 
this drug in your child and other children, we hope to learn how to better use this drug 
for other children with ADHD in the futu re.  
 
Do you have any questions for me at this point? (yes/no)  
 
Next, I’d like to tell you what we would ask from you and your child during the study if 
you were to enroll.  
  
This study takes place over about 6 -8 months.  There are 8 total visits —4 researc h visits 
and 4 clinic visits.  At research visits, we study how your child is breaking down the 
medicine.  At clinic visits, you and your child visit with a study doctor to see how the 
medicine is working at home and at school and change the dose if needed .  First, we 
would bring you in for a research visit to gather information about your child , including 
his or her ADHD symptoms, health history, and draw blood for genetic testing and to 
make sure your child is health enough for the study.  Then, we would have you and your 
child meet with a study doctor at a clinic visit to see if ATX would be a good fit.  If so, we 
would then calculate a dose for your child and start your child on the medicine.  
We will ask you and your child to come to the research unit (P CRU) at the Adele Hall 
campus to give the first dose of medicine.  After we give the medicine, we will draw 
small blood samples multiple times over the course of several hours to measure the 
amount of drug in your child’s blood.  This visit will generally last about 12 -14 hours.  
Depending on the information we learn about your child’s genes, we may ask your child 
to stay overnight to measure more samples.  This would be a 24 hour study.   We will 
know how long your child’s visits will last before you ever st art the medicine so you can 
decide if this will work for your family. This visit is to help us understand how your child 
breaks down the medicine after just one dose.  
  
Do you have any questions for me at this point? (yes/no)  
 
After this, we will send you and your child home with a prescription of atomoxetine to 
take every day.   Your child will see your study physician every month or 2 to see how the 
medicine is working at home and at school. If needed, the doctor may adjust the dose.  
In addition to th ese doctor’s visits, we will ask you and your child to come back to 
repeat the blood samples again two times.  One time is anytime between these doctor’s 
visits, and the other time is after all of the doctor’s visits are completed. These help us 
understand  how your child breaks down the medicine after your child’s body is used to 
taking the medicine every day.  
 
So altogether, the study will last 6 -8 months, include 4 clinic visits, and 4 research visits, 
and your child will take this medicine every day.  T his study is voluntary, so if at any 
point you or your child want to stop, you may and it will not affect the care your child 
receives at Children’s Mercy in any way.

Do you have any questions for me at this point? (yes/no)  
 
Please note, there are some me dications your child cannot take to participate in this 
study. In particular, if your child is currently taking a stimulant medication for ADHD, he 
or she cannot continue this medication during the study. If you and your child choose to 
enroll in the study , we will ask your child to “washout” of his or her ADHD medication. 
This means your child will need to stop the ADHD medication and wait at least 1 week to 
“washout” the effects of the ADHD medication so that your child is back to his or her 
ADHD symptom baseline.  Please note, if you do choose to enroll, we ask that you do 
not stop your child’s ADHD medication until after you and your child have signed the 
study consent form with a study team member in person at your first research visit.  
 
Do you have an y questions about this part? (yes/no)  
 
If you are interested in learning more, I would like to email or mail you some further 
information about the study for you to review with your child.  I realize this is a lot of 
information, so please take the necessa ry time you need before deciding whether you 
and your child want to participate in this study.  
 
Would it be okay to check back in with you? (yes/no)  
 
When would you like me to contact you? (record time or date)

 Appendix E – Recruitment Email or Letter  
 
Thank you for your interest in our ADHD study.  I have attached the study consent form ,  
and a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) sheet for you to review. These include details 
about the study including the purpose of the study, what would happen during the 
study, risks, benefits, alternatives, etc.  The consent form includes sections  at the end  
for y our signature, but please do not sign this.  This form is simply for your information 
at this time.  If you and your child choose to enroll in our study, a study team member 
will review this with you and your child in person and answer any questions you ma y 
have before we ask you to sign the form.    
If your child is currently taking stimulant medication for ADHD, he or she cannot 
continue this medication during the study.  Y our child will need to stop, or “wash out” of 
his or her medication to start atomox etine. We ask participants to stop ADHD 
medication for at least a week before starting atomoxetine so that the study team can 
better understand your child’s ADHD symptoms off medicine and how this new 
medicine will work in your child’s body.  We ask that y ou do NOT stop your child’s ADHD 
medication until after you and your child come in to sign the consent form and meet 
with a study doctor to talk about the washout.  
When your child stops his or her medication, his or her ADHD symptoms will likely 
return.  Your child may have trouble focusing and have more impulsive behavior.  Some 
children may handle this brief time off ADHD medicine just fine while other children 
may have a lot of trouble at school and home.  We know that as the parent, you know 
your child  better than anyone else.  Therefore, we want you to think about if washing 
out is okay for your child. These behaviors may impact school performance, after -school 
sports and activities, and how your child interacts with family, teachers, and other 
childre n. Some children may do better washing out of ADHD medicine over a school 
break when ADHD behaviors are less disruptive.  While you look over the consent form 
and FAQ sheet, please consider if the washout is appropriate for your child.  
If you have any que stions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to us via phone or 
email.  
Thank you,

 Appendix F – Study Coordinator/Research Assistant Scheduling Script  
 
Hi, my name is ________________ and I am a study coordinator/research assistant at 
Children's Mercy Hospital. Thank you for your interest in our study.  I am calling to 
schedule your child’s first research visit.  But first, I’d like to talk to you about a  few key 
points in the study.  
First, I want to review how long visits are and how often visits occur.  
1) Research Visit 1 lasts about 4 -5 hours; Part 1 is about 1 hour and Part 2 is 3 -4 
hours.  
2) Research Visits 2 -4 last at least 14 hours.  Depending on what we learn about 
your child, some children have 24 – 72 hour visits, and we will ask that your child 
stay overnight at the research center.  
3) The first 2 study physician visits and first 2 research visits happen close together 
over the first 2 -3 months of the study. After that, visits happen every month or 2.  
Second, if your child will need to wash out of his or her ADHD medication, please do not 
stop the medication until after you sign the  consent form.  
Do you have any questions for me at this time?  
Third, the study medicine, atomoxetine, is only available in capsules (pills), so children 
who enroll in the study will need to be able to swallow pills to start the medicine. If your 
child has  trouble swallowing pills or has never tried swallowing pills, we are happy to 
work with your child to help teach him/her how to do this.  
Lastly, I want to talk a little bit about the blood draws that happen in this study.  
In this study, we ask participan ts to have multiple blood draws, and we know these 
needlesticks can be stressful to some children. We want to help make these needlesticks 
as stress -free as possible for any child who wants to be in the study.  It can be hard to 
predict how a child will re act to a needlestick.  However, we have learned some things 
from other children who have enrolled in our study.  Children who have never had a 
needlestick, such as a blood draw at a doctor’s office, vaccinations, or even had an IV, 
tend to be nervous about  the blood draw. Also, children who have general fears about 
hospitals, clinics, and healthcare situations and children who “just shut down” in 
unfamiliar situations have more trouble than others.  I want to encourage you to think 
about how your child migh t do with the needlesticks and let us know what we can do to 
make this a pleasant experience for your child.  When you come in for your first 
research visit, a study team member will talk to you to learn about your child’s comfort 
level with needlesticks b efore we do any blood draws.   
 
Do you have any questions for me at this time?

 Appendix L – Sample letters to Share Genetic Information  
 
To the family of (Participant’s Name) (DOB MM/DD/YYYY):  
 
Your child had genetic testing as a part of this ADHD study.  This was done to help us 
learn how fast or slow your child “metabolizes” —or breaks down and removes 
atomoxetine (Strattera®) from his body.  We want to re turn the test results to you and 
your child.   
 
What are the results?  
 
In general, atomoxetine is metabolized, or broken down, by CYP2D6 (pronounced “sip -
2-d-6”).  Based on the genetic testing, your child is a(n) ___________  metabolizer for 
CYP2D6. This me ans when your child takes medicines like atomoxetine, your child’s 
body breaks down the medicine __________  than most people in the population.   
 
There are 4 different types of CYP2D6 metabolizers. They are:  
 
 
 
For most people, CYP2D6 breaks down almost all  the atomoxetine a person takes.  For 
some people, CYP2D6 doesn’t work as well.  For these people, another enzyme, 
CYP2C19 (pronounced “sip -2-c-19”), will help break atomoxetine down, too.    
 
 Types of CYP2D6 Metabolizers  
Ultra -Rapid  
Metabolizer    
Break down the medicine much faster than 
most people in the population  
Normal  
Metabolizer    
Break down the medicine about the same as 
most people in the population  
Intermediate  
Metabolizer    
Break down the medicine a little slower than 
most people in the population  
Poor  
Metabolizer    
Break down the medicine much slower than 
most people in the population  

ATX PBPK -PD Clinical Study  
IRB # 16100728  
Page  132 of 143 
 Your child’s genetic testing also told us your child is a(n) _ _________  metabolizer for 
CYP2C19. This means when your child takes medicines normally broken down by this 
enzyme, your child’s body breaks down the medicine ___________ than most people in 
the population.   
 
There are 5 different types of CYP2C19 metaboli zers. They are:  
 
 
 
What else should I know about the results?  
These enzymes, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, break down several other medicines.  Your 
child may take these other medications in the future.  However, your child and his /her 
regular doctors cannot  use the research study results to help figure out if and how to 
use these other medicines if he /she may need them in the future. These test results can 
only be used for this ADHD  medicine  in this ADHD study . This means we can’t put the 
results in your child’s medical chart or send the results to his /her regular doctor.  This 
also means your child’s regular doctor cannot use the results to help treat your child for 
any illnesses or diseases outside of th is study.  
 
Why can’t these results be used outside the study?  Types of CYP2C19 Metabolizers

 By law, we are not able to use these results outside of the study.  This is because our 
tests are run in a “research -grade” lab instead of a “clinical -grade” lab. Clinical grade 
labs have diffe rent rules than research grade labs, and the tests they run are often 
different.  When your child goes to his /her regular doctor and has blood drawn for lab 
work, the tests are likely run in a clinical grade lab.  
 
For this study, we wanted to look at your  child’s genetics that control how CYP2D6 and 
CYP2C19 works.  If your child’s genetic testing were done in a clinical -grade lab, the test 
would probably look for only a few well -known differences in your child’s genetics that 
might have a big impact on how  CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 work. Our research grade tests 
look at these same differences, but we also look for other new and rare differences that 
are not well studied yet.  Our research -grade test works better for our study because we 
want to look for all of the se differences, not just the well -known ones.  
   
Please know, even though our study testing is not run in a clinical -grade lab, this does 
not mean they are wrong or unsafe.  We feel very confident that these results are 
accurate enough for the study to he lp us determine a dose of atomoxetin e that works 
and is safe for your child .  However, we are not sure yet what these results mean for 
other medicines that are broken down by these enzymes.  More studies need to be done 
to fully understand what this means for other medicines.  
I want to learn more about my child’s test results. What should I do next?  
If you would like to have your child’s genetic information about CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 
in his medical chart for your child and his /her other doctors to make medic al decisions 
outside of the study, you can repeat the test in a clinical grade lab.  Before you decide to 
repeat the test, you and your child should consider what the testing can tell you and how 
it might help your child’s doctors in the future.    
What can the testing tell me and my child’s doctors?  
Learning more information about how fast or slow your child’s CYP2D6 enzyme and 
CYP2C19 enzyme works may help you and your child’s doctors figure out which 
medicines he /she should or should not use and s how if he /she may be at risk of side 
effects or a medicine not working at a normal dose.  Your child will likely benefit more 
from learning more about these medicines if he /she is a: 
 
• CYP2D6 poor metabolizer  • CYP2C19 poor metabolizer  
• CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizer  • CYP2C19 intermediate metabolizer

Learning more may help because regular doses of these medicines may be too high or 
too low for your child  or they may not work at all .

 Which medicines should I know about?   
There are several medicines that are affected by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19.  Currently, 
there are guidelines for only a few of these medicines that say the dose should be higher 
or lower than normally prescribed if you break down the medicine faster or slower than 
most people in the population.  Below are some examples of medicines where there are 
guidelines for CYP2D6 and/or CYP2C19 genotype:  
Medicine  Used for this Disease or Illness  
Atomoxetine (Strattera®)  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder 
(ADHD)  
Codeine  Pain Management  
Ondansetron (Zofran®)  Nausea/Vomiting  
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors 
(SSRIs)  
• Paroxetine (Paxil®)  
• Fluvoxamine (Luvox®)  
• Citalopram (Celexa®)  
• Escitalopram (Lexapro®)  
• Sertraline (Zoloft®)  Depression and Anxiety  
Tricyclic Antidepressants  
• Amitriptyline (Elavil®)  
• Nortriptyline (Pamelor®)  Depression and Pain Management  
Clopidogrel (Plavix®)  Stroke or Heart Attack (Blood Thinner)  
 
If your child is prescribed any of these medicines in the future, repeating the genetic 
testing in a clinical -grade laboratory may help your child’s doctors decide if the medicine 
is okay to use and at what dose. Right now, there are only guidelines for these 
medicines.  There may be guidel ines for other medicines in the future as more research 
studies are done.  Please talk to your child’s regular doctor to decide if genetic testing for 
metabolizing medicines may be helpful in the future.  
Where can the testing be done and how can I learn more?  
If you would like to learn more about how your child breaks down medicines with 
CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, your child can be seen at a clinic here at Children’s Mercy 
Hospital called GOLDILOKs (Genomic -And-Ontogeny -Linked Dose Individualization and 
Clinical Optimization for Kids) Clinic.  At GOLDILOKs clinic, a physician, or doctor, will 
talk with you and your child and answer your questions.  After this discussion, you and 
your doctor may choose to repeat the genetic test using a clinical -grade lab an d discuss 
what the results mean for other medicines.  The study team will not pay for the costs of 
the GOLDILOKs Clinic visit or the testing GOLDILOKs Clinic does.  The costs for these 
services will be billed to your child’s insurer.  You will be responsib le for any such costs 
your child’s insurer does not cover.  If your child is uninsured, you will be responsible for 
these costs.

 If you would like to learn more about GOLDILOKs clinic or make an appointment, please 
visit their website at https://www.childrensmercy.org/departments -and-
clinics/pharmacology -and-toxicology/goldiloks -clinic/  or call the clinic at (816) 234 -3059.  
What else should I  know about?  
Please note, there is a chance that the results from the clinical grade testing and the 
study genetic testing may be different.  This is because the tests are run differently.  It 
does not necessarily mean the tests from the study were wrong.  As mentioned before, 
clinical -grade tests are set up to look for the differences in each person’s genetics that 
might have a big impact on how CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 work. Our research -grade tests 
look at these same differences, but we also look for other new  and rare differences that 
are not well studied yet.  Because the tests are not looking for the same differences, the 
results may come out different.  
Who can I talk to if I have questions or concerns?  
We understand that you may have questions about this in formation.  Please feel free to 
reach out to a member of the study team at either the study cell phone (816) 359 -2963 
or the study email ADHDstudyteam@cmh.edu .

Thank you for allowing the Division of Developmental and Behavioral Sciences to 
provide care for [subject name]’s Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). I am 
writing this letter to assist you with transferring care to your regular healthcare 
prov ider.  [Subject] was enrolled in the following research study: An Open -Label, Single - 
and Multi -Dose Study to Evaluate the Relationship between the Pharmacokinetics, 
Pharmacodynamics, and Clinical Outcomes of Atomoxetine in CYP2D6 Extensive, 
Intermediate, and Poor Metabolizers in Children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity 
Disorder.   [Subject]’s current dose of atomoxetine is __ mg [frequency]. For future 
comparisons, you may wish to share with his regular provider that his/her most recent 
NICHQ Vanderbil t Assessment Scales (  ADHD rating scales ) indicated that # of 9 
symptoms of inattention and # of 9 symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity were in the 
significant range.  This demonstrates ________ improvement from the time of 
enrollment when rating scales i ndicated that # of 9 symptoms of inattention and # of 9 
symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity were in the significant range. It is recommended 
not to abruptly stop this medication and to make any future changes under the 
guidance of his physician.  I am ha ppy to provide his physician with additional

 Appendix O – Liter ature Search  and Documentation for Washout and Return to Baseline  
 
When a literature search must be conducted to determine the length of time needed to 
wash out of medications and when to administer baseline questionnaires, the follow 
data should be sought:  
 
• Pharmacokinetics parameters of the drug in question . Ideally, these parameters 
will have been obtained in children, although for many drugs the data do not yet 
exist. When this data is not available in pediatrics, adult data may be used to 
estimate half -life and the expected amount of time needed to  for medication to 
be removed from systemic circulation . In some instances, ranges are given for 
half-life. Use the most conservative value for estimating length of time needed 
to wash out of medc iation. Additionally, consider estimating  if ontogeny plays a 
role in in key processes for drug removal (i.e. CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 
genotype/ activity or renal function).  
• Pharmacodynamics parameters of the drug in question . This information should  
be sought to determine the amount of time needed for the effects of medication 
to wear off. The time needed for this to occur may be longer than the washout 
period for drugs. For many older drugs, this information is not available. Efforts 
should be made to determine if these parameters are reported in children 
and/or adults. Please note that for many neuropsychiatric drugs, there may 
information about the direct action of the drug, however little to no data may 
exist for the downstream modifications cause d as of result of taking medication.  
• Behavior of the participant . A proxy of return to baseline behaviors is also 
through evaluation of the participant’s behaviors. This can be done when 
discussing the study with parent and through chart review.  
• Prior tria ls evaluating the drug in question . Another source of information is 
evaluating how previous clinical trials have washed out of the drug in question. 
Crossover trials with a washout and baseline measure during washout can 
provide some insight to the length  of time needed for drug concentrations and 
drug effects to return to baseline.  
• Expert opinion. In addition to the data above, washout duration  will be 
discussed  at clinical project meetings  by study team members. Study team 
members include professionals from various backgrounds including 
developmental and behavioral pediatricians, a pediatric psychologist, and clinical 
pharmacologists.  
• When little to no data exist for a drug . If the study team is unable to make an 
estimation as to how long to wash out of  medication, it is advisable that the 
participant not continue further in the study. The participant will have met 
exclusion criteria, “Subject is considered by PI to be unsuitable for participation 
in the study for any reason.”

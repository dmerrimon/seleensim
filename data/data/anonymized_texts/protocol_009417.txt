ENABLE MRI Study  
Objective(s)  The objective of this study is to collect data to confirm the safety and 
effectiveness of the ImageReady™ MR Conditional Defibrillation System when 
used in the 1.5T MRI environment under the labeled Conditions of Use (Phase I).  
Additionally, t he study will assess medically necessary MR scans according to the 
labeled Conditions of Use to provide real -world scanni ng data (Phas e I and Phase 
II). 
The study also aims to demonstrate the continued ability of the ImageReady MR 
Conditional Defibrillation System to sense and detect ventricular fibrillation ( VF) 
post MRI scan by collecting and analyzing data from spontaneous VF episodes , 
“for-cause” VF inductions, and from an optional VF induction Sub- study.

Page 22 of 128  4. Introduction  
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic technique that images body parts by 
producing a static mag netic field followed by rapidly changing radiofrequency fields to 
excite hydrogen nuclei. MRI scanning is now the imaging modality of choice for many 
neurological and musculoskeletal conditions. In the past, implanted cardiac devices including 
pacemakers and implanted cardioverter -defibrillators have been contraindicated in MRI 
scanners 1,2. Recent studies, though, have suggested that select patients may be safely 
scanned 3,4. Medical societies in both Europe and the United States have acknowledged these 
findings with publication of expert opinion and guidelines on scanning patients with 
implanted cardiac devices5,6. 
A number of studies have reported on the relati ve safety of scanning patients with cardiac 
pacemakers or implantable cardioverter -defibrillators. Martin, et al. reported on 54 patients 
undergoing 62 scans. In their series, 9.4% of patients had significant pacing threshold 
changes, of which 1.9% require d device reprogramming3. Nazarian, et al.7 evaluated 55 
patients undergoing 68 scans without any adverse events. In a series reported by Sommer, et 
al. 4, 82 patients underwent 115 scans. An increase in pacing thresholds was seen in 3.1% of 
leads. In a lar ger series, 103 patients underwent a total of 127 scans without any significant 
change in pacing thresholds immediately post -scan, though small changes in sensed 
amplitude and pacing impedances were seen8. In that series, no restriction was placed on 
landm ark or on maximum SAR. When high- SAR scans (SAR greater than 2 W/kg) were 
evaluated separately, no significant change in pacing capture thresholds were seen, though 
immediately post- scan lead impedances and sensed amplitudes were lower.  
More recently, prel iminary results from  the first 829 cases (617 pacemakers, 212 ICDs, 1620 
leads)  of a large , prospective , Investigational Device Exemption (IDE)  study  showed no 
deaths, device failures, generator/lead replacements, ventricular arrhythmias, or losses of 
capture during non -thoracic MRI at 1.5T  for routine clinical care9. Nazarian et al  10, in a 
prospective non randomized trial involving 555 MRI scans from 488 patients, showed that 
MRI was performed safely . There was no immediate or long -term change in device variables 
that require d system revision or reprogramming. Small changes in acute lead sensing, 
impedances, and capture thresholds after MRI were reported and attributed to heating at the 
lead–tissue interface10. 
Boston Scientific  (BSC)  intends to provide MR Conditional labeling to certain models of 
existing Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator (ICD) and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy – 
Defibrillator (CRT -D) implantable pulse generators  (PGs) and associated implantable leads.  
This combination of PGs and le ads will be referred to as the ImageReady™ MR Conditional 
Defibrillation System (ImageReady System). The ImageReady System will have CE mark at 
the start of the ENABLE MRI study and commercially available in geographies that accept 
CE mark. The ENABLE MRI study will be used to support regulatory approval of the 
ImageReady System in additional geographies.

5.1 Boston Scientific ’s ICD and CRT family of PGs  
Boston Scientific’s MR Conditional defibrillators are comprised of select models of the 
AUTOGEN, DYNAGEN, INOGEN, and ORIGEN ICD and  CRT -D devices . Only single 
chamber (VR) and dual chamber (DR) ICD devices with a DF4 right ventricular port and 
CRT -D devices with IS -1/DF4/IS4 port are MR Conditional. The BSC ICD and CRT -D 
models used in the study are approved for commercial use, with t he exception of the 
AUTOGEN PGs which are not commercially approved in the US at the start of the study. In 
the US, the AUTOGEN PGs may become approved during the study; however the devices 
still cannot be used in the ENABLE MRI study in the US. 
The PG hardware was not changed. The PG firmware (FW) and Programmer Software 
Application (SW) was updated to provide MRI Protection Mode to these models. Refer to the 
ICD and CRT -D Reference Guide for additional information about the PGs .  
 
5.1.1 MRI Protection Mode  
MRI Protection Mode is accessible through the 3120 programmer/recorder/monitor (PRM) 
that has the 2868 software application ( see Section 5.5). Prior to the patient undergoing an 
MRI scan, the PG must be programmed to the MRI Protection Mode using the PRM. 
C1734   Confidential  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 25 of 128  Adherence to the MRI Conditions of Use must be verified prior to each scan to assess the 
patient ’s eligibility and readiness for an MR scan  (see Section 6) . 
 
At the start of the study, in international geographies, the ‘MRI Protection Mode’ will have 
CE mark and be available for commercial  use.  
In the US, a programmer key (dongle) is required to interrogate the VR ICDs and 
CRT -Ds to access the investigational ‘MRI Protection Mode’.  
NOTE: MR I Protection Mode may become approved in the US during the study. If this 
occurs, then the dongle wi ll no longer be needed to access MRI Protection Mode. 
In the MRI Protection M ode, the following features and functions are suspended:  
• Bradycardia sensing/ pacing  
• Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy  
• Tachycardia detection and therapy  
• PaceSafe™** automatic threshold(s)  
• Daily diagnostics (Lead Impedance, Intrinsic Amplitude, Pace Threshold)  
• Motion and respiratory sensors  
• Magnet detection  
• RF telemetry  
• Battery voltage monitoring  
• Beeper is disabled  
** Only available internationally outside the US  
NOTE: In MRI Protection Mode there is no pacing and no anti tachycardia therapy 
available.  
During MRI Protection Mode, t he patient will not receive pacing until the PG is returned 
back to normal operation. Additionally, t he system will not detect ventricular arrhythmia s 
and the patient will not receive anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) or shock defibrillation therapy 
until the pulse generator is programmed back to normal operation.  
Refer to the BSC ImageReady MR Conditional Defibrillation System MRI Technical Guide2, 
here to forward referred to as the BSC MRI Technical Guide , for additional information 
regarding MRI Protection Mode . 
5.1.1.1 Beeper Feature  
The PGs contain a B eeper that can be utilized to alert the patient  in certain situations or to 
provide audible feedback when transitioning into and out of certain modes of operation for 
health care provider (HCP) notification. The Beeper provides: (1) an audible patient warning 
                                                 
2 The BSC MRI Technical Guide  is investigational in the US, at the start of the study. This may become 
approved in the US during the study.  
C1734   Confidential  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 26 of 128  when potential therapy failure is detected between scheduled PG checks with an HCP, and 
(2) audible feedback to HCP regarding the state of the PG such as, current tachycardia mode 
and when charging for shock therapy.  An inaudible Beeper results in an increase of the 
associated risk.    
The Beeper m ay no longer be audible following an MRI scan. Coming in contact with the 
strong magnetic field of an MRI scanner demagnetizes the magnet within the beeper and 
causes a permanent loss of the beeper volume. This phenomenon is dependent on the spatial 
orient ation of the PG within the bore.  Boston Scientific testing has shown that the standard 
orientation of the PG within the patient pocket (planar within the chest) and the patient 
position condition of use (supine or prone within the bore) results in signifi cant loss of 
beeper volume.   
Loss of Beeper volume cannot be recovered, even after leaving the MR scan environment 
and exiting MRI Protection Mode. LATITUDE NXT provides alerts for all patient safety 
events that would result in the PG beeping.  
It is stron gly recommended that patients are followed on LATITUDE NXT after an 
MRI scan if they are not already. Otherwise, an in -clinic follow -up schedule of every 
three months is strongly recommended to monitor device performance.   
Refer to the BSC MRI Technical Guide  for additional i nformation on the Beeper.   
5.1.1.2 MRI Protection Mode Time -out Function  
The MRI Protection Mode Time -out function allows the user to choose the length of time the 
PG remains in the MRI Protection Mode  before returning to previ ous settings.  MRI 
Protection Mode is programmed using the PRM. The Time -out feature has programmable 
values of OFF, 3, 6, 9 and 12 hours. At the conclusion of the programmed duration the PG 
returns to the previously programmed therapy parameters and settings. MRI Protec tion Mode 
may also be exited manually at any time during the time -out period. If the MRI Protection 
Time -out value is programmed to OFF, the patient will not receive Bradycardia pacing, 
Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy, or Tachycardia therapy until the PG  is programmed out 
of MRI Protection Mode and back to previous  operation.  
Refer to the BSC MRI Technical Guide  for additional information on the MRI Protection 
Mode Time -out Function. 
5.2 Boston Scientific’s Right Atrial Leads and Accessories   
The FINELINE II Stero x/Sterox EZ (referred to as FINELINE II) and INGEVITY MRI leads 
are steroid -eluting, bipolar endocardial pacing leads designed for atrial or ventricular use for 
chronic pacing, and are compatible with PGs that accept IS -13 connectors. The FINELINE II 
and INGEVITY MRI lead families consist of passive fixation and active fixation leads. A 
radiopaque suture sleeve is pre -loaded on the INGEVITY MRI leads, and is also available in 
a slit form as an accessory ( Table 5- 1). Suture sleeves for FINELINE II leads are also

standard DF44 terminal connector design. Passive and active fixation models are available in 
both lead fa milies. Refer to the Physician Lead Manuals for additional information about the 
leads.  
Boston Scientific’s Right Ventricular lead and accessory models that are included in the 
ImageReady System and allowed for the study are listed in  Table 5- 1.  
Internationally, the RELIANCE 4- FRONT (DF4) and ENDOTAK RELIANCE  (DF4) leads 
are approved for commercial use. In the US, the  ENDOTAK RELIANCE (DF4) leads are 
approved for commercial use  and may be used in the study. The RELIANCE 4 -FRONT 
(DF4) lead will be investigational in the US during a portion or the entire duration of the 
ENABLE MRI study. Only patients with existing R ELIANCE  4-FRONT  (DF4) l eads from 
another  Boston Scientific -sponsored IDE study ( NAVIGATE X4 Study, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
G130222) will be allowed to participate in the US.  
5.4 Boston Scientific’s ACUITY X4 Quadripolar LV Lead and Accessories  
The ACUITY X4 quadripolar coronary venous leads are intended for  chronic left ventricular 
pacing and sensing. These steroid -eluting leads have an IS45 four -pole connector. A variety 
of pace/sense configurations are possible with the four distal electrodes that can function as 
cathodes (all four electrodes) or anodes (all except E1, the most distal electrode) when used 
with a compatible pulse generator. See Figure 5.4 -1 below for a picture of the ACUITY X4 
leads as well as the layout of the electrodes on the lead. Refer to the Physician Lead Manuals 
for additional information  about the leads .

E2: LV Ring 2 E3: LV Ring 3  
E4: LV Ring 4 
Boston Scientific’s ACUITY X4 quadripolar left ventricular lead and accessory models are 
included in the ImageReady System and are allowed for the study (see Table 5-1).  
Internationally, the ACUITY X4 leads are approved for commercial use. In the US, the 
ACUITY X4 leads may be investigational at the start of the study. If the ACUITY X4 lead 
becomes approve d for commercial use in the US , the lead will no longer be tracked as an 
investigational lead. Any investigational ACUITY X4 leads used in the ENABL E MRI study 
will be reconciled in a report following approval. 
5.5 Programming System 
The programming system consists of the commercially approved 3120 Zoom LATITUDE 
PRM and 2868 programmer software application ( Table 5-2 ).  
The PRM is MR Unsafe and must remain outside the MRI site Zone III (and higher) as 
defined by the American College of Radiology Guidance Document for Safe MR Practices6. 
Under no circumstances should the PRM be brought into the MRI scanner room, the control 
room, or the MRI site Zone III or I V areas.  
In the US, a  programmer key (dongle) is required to interrogate the VR ICDs and 
CRT -Ds to access the investigational ‘MRI Protection Mode’.  A programmer key is only 
available for use by a BSC representative. Therefore a BSC representative will need to be 
present any time the investigational ‘MRI Protection Mode’ is needed to be accessed (i.e., all 
MR scans). A programmer key is not required for device interrogation. It is anticipated that 
the ImageReady System will become approved for commercial u se in the US during the 
course of the study. If this occurs, then a programmer key will no longer be needed to access 
the MRI Protection Mode.

9. Design    
The ENABLE MRI S tudy is a prospective, non- randomized, confirmatory, global study 
conducted as an IDE in the United States, and as a post market study  in Europe , Israel and  
Asia Pacific.  
The study w ill be conducted in two phases as  described in Section 9.1.  
A subset of subjects enrolled into Phase I of the ENABLE MRI study may be eligible to 
participate in the VF induction S ub-study as described in section  11.2.8.  
9.1 Scale and Duration  
The ENABLE MRI S tudy will be conducted in two phases to enroll 500 subjects at 
approximately  70 investigational centers in the United States, Europe, Israel and Asia - 
Pacific.  
Subjects will initially be enrolled into Phase I to undergo a non- diagnostic study required MR 
Scan. Once Phase I is complete, subjects will be enrolled into Phase II where there is no 
requirement to undergo a  non- diagnostic study required MR scan.  
Phase I will consist of two cohorts:  
C1734   Confidential  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 33 of 128  • Up to  37 subjects will be used for an interim analysis. Of these subjects, the first 20 
who undergo the study required MR I scan and complete the MR I + 1 Month Visit 
will be used for this analysis.  
• The second cohort will consist of subjects who will receive the non -diagnostic study 
required MR scan until 137 CRT -D and 28 VR ICD subjects undergo the study 
required MR scan (complete or incomplete) .  
• De novo implants and existing implants may be enrolled in Phase I  
• There will be a non- diagnostic study required MR  scan (during the MRI visit)  
• There will be a study required MRI visit and MRI  + 1 month visit   
• Spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (VT) and spontaneous VF episodes  post MRI 
scan will be collected   
• Post MRI VF induction testing will be performed for subjects who either meet the 
“for cause” VF induction criteria or are enrolled into the VF Induction Sub- study as 
defined in section 12.8.2.       
• Subjects e nrolled in Phase I will be followed for up to 3 years  
• Phase I  Cohort  completion  is anticipate d when:  
1. 137 CRT -D and 28 VR ICD  subjects are enrolled and have been through their 
MRI Visit (incomplete or complete MR scan)  
and 
2. A total of 25 VF episodes post MRI from 25 different subjects are available 
(as defined in section 12.8.2)  
• BSC will notify sites when enrollments for the VR ICD and CRT -D cohorts are 
complete , and when Phase I  is complete . 
• BSC will ensure that a minimum of 50% of Phase I  subjects will be enrolled in the 
US 
 
Phase II:  Phase II subjects will consist of the following:  
• Phase I subject s who do not have the study -required sc an will automatically be rolled 
into Phase II  
• Any subjects enrolled after the completion of Phase I will be considered as Phase II 
subjects  
• Any combination of VR ICDs (DF4), DR ICDs * (IS1/DF4 ) and CRT -Ds 
(IS1/DF4/IS4) ImageReady S ystems may be used .   
o *Note: DR ICD system s may only be used  internationally outside the US.

All subjects enrolled in this study must be followed according to the investigational plan 
unless Boston Scientific notifies the Investigator to the contrary or Boston Scientific has 
officially closed the study. The duration of the study is expected to be approximately 5 .5 
years.  
9.2 Justification for the Study Design  
The ENABLE MRI Study is being conducted to collect data to support pre -market regulatory 
agency submissions for approval of the ImageReady System for use in the 1.5T MRI 
environment  (Phase I) , in geographies where prospective clinical data is required . The study 
data will also be used to support worldwide post -market requirements in certain geographies.  
The study is designed with one  interim analys is to support regulatory submissions .   
The study also aims to demonstrate the continued ability of the ImageReady™ MR 
Conditional Defibrillation System to sense and detect VF post MR I scan by collecting and 
analyzing data from spontaneous VF episodes, “for -cause” VF inductions, and from the VF 
induction Sub- study.  
Phase I and Phase II data will be used to evaluate VT/VF sensing after an MR scan, potential 
influence of multiple MR scans on the ImageReady System, Beeper functionality after MR 
scans , and programming of the MRI Protection Mode (see S ection 13.2 on ancillary 
analysis ).  
Data from the FINELINE II leads will be used to support regulatory approval in geographies 
that do not already  have market approval of FINELINE II as an MR Conditional lead. 
10.  Subject Selection  
10.1 Study Population and Eligibility

form will be evaluated for the following criteria: 
• Radiologist approval to undergo MRI scan if metal objects in body (exclusion 
criterion #3)  
• 12 lead ECG & 10s rhythm strip (exclusion crite rion #5)  
Subjects who meet  these exclusion criteria will be considered Consent ineligible and will not 
count toward the enrollment ceiling.  
Subjects who do not meet these exclusion criteria will be  considered enrolled in the  
ENABLE MRI  study and will count toward the enrollment ceiling.   
Subjects who are part of the ENABLE MRI study and also provide written, signed and dated 
informed consent to participate in the VF Induction Sub- Study will be considered enrolled in 
the VF Induction Sub- Study .  
 
11.2 Withdrawal   
All subjects enrolled in the clinical study (including those withdrawn from the clinical study 
or lost to follow -up) shall be accounted for and documented. If a subject withdraws from the 
clinical investigation, the reason(s) shall b e reported.  
For US subjects:  If such withdrawal is due to problems related to investigational device 
safety or performance, the investigator shall ask for the subject’s permission to follow his/her 
status/condition outside of the clinical study until the implanted investigational devices are 
approved by the FDA or the device is explanted.

Page 41 of 128  Reasons for withdrawal include, but are not limited to:  
• Subject who does not receive a  Boston Scientific ImageReady MR Conditional 
Defibrillation System (no follow -up requirements)  
• Subject who receive only a partial Boston Scientific ImageReady MR Conditional 
Defibrillation System (see s ection 11.3.4 for follow -up requirements)  
• Subjects that have a PG or lead changeout that is not a Boston Scientific ImageReady 
MR Conditional Defibrillation System component ( See Section 5)   
• Subjects in Phase I who refuse to undergo the study require MR scan and are not 
willing to be rolled into Phase II  
• Subjects already enrolled with previous protocol versions , who have not performed 
the MRI visit and who meet the updated exclusion criterion #5  
• Subjects who fail the heart rhythm monitoring requirements at the MRI visit 
• Physician discretion  
• Subject choice to withdraw consent  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Death 
While study withdrawal is discouraged, subjects may withdraw from the ENABLE MRI 
study and/or the VF Induction Sub- study at any time, with or without reason, and without 
prejudice to further treatment.  
All applicable case report forms up to the point of subject withdrawal and a “Subject Status” 
form must be completed. Subjects who are “lost -to-follow -up” should have documented 
attempts to contact them prior to completion of the “Subject Status” form.  
Additional study data may no longer be collected after th e point at which a subject has been 
withdrawn from the study or withdraws his/her consent, for whatever reason. All open 
adverse events should be closed or documented as chronic. Data collected up to the point of 
subject withdrawal may be used.  
11.3 Subject Sta tus and Classification  
Subjects enrolled in the ENABLE MRI study will be placed into one of six  classifications, as 
defined below.   
If a subject receives the PG or lead (s) listed in S ection 5 after enrollment, they will be treated 
as a de novo. De novo subjects are classified based on sections 11.3.1to 11.3.5.  
11.3.1 Intent  
Intent  refers to a subject who has been enrolled, but does not have the lead(s) or PG 
introduced into their body. There are no follow -up requirements for intent subjects. The 
C1734   Confidential  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 42 of 128  origina l informed consent form (ICF) and screening documentation for intent subjects should 
be maintained in the Center’s files.  
11.3.2 Consent ineligible  
Consent ineligible  refers to a subject who signed the ICF but meet s exclusion criteria #3 or  
#5. As applicable, all adverse events need to be reported up to the point of withdrawal. There 
are no follow -up requirements for consent ineligible subjects. The original informed consent 
form (ICF) and screening documentation for consent ineligible subje cts should be maintained 
in the Center’s files. These subjects do not count towards the enrollment ceiling. 
11.3.3 Attempt  
Attempt refers to a subject who 1) has been enrolled in the Study, 2) has had anesthesia 
administered in preparation for the surgical impla nt procedure, 3) has had the lead(s)  and/or 
PG introduced into the subject’s body , but 4) is not successfully implanted with any portion 
of the ImageReady System during the implant procedure (meaning the subject is not 
successf ully implanted with either the PG or lead(s)).  
Attempt subjects must be followed 30 ± 7 days post -attempted ImageReady System implant 
to assure there are no associated adverse events, or to assure the resolution of any adverse 
events associated with the at tempted ImageReady System implant. 
11.3.4 Partial Implant  
Partial Implant refers to a subject who is implanted with a component of the ImageReady 
System during the implant procedure, but does not end up with a complete ImageReady 
System. Due to the fact that thes e subjects do not have a full ImageReady System, according 
to the Conditions of Use in the BSC MRI Technical Guide , they shall not receive the MR 
Scan for the ENABLE MRI study.  
• For US subjects: If investigational leads were implanted, the subjects must be  
followed for safety. These subjects must be followed at each time point required for 
the study until the implanted investigational leads are approved by the FDA or the 
device is explanted.   
• If there were no investigational leads implanted, Partial Implan t subjects must be 
followed 30 ± 7 days post - ImageReady System implant to assure there are no 
associated adverse events, or to assure the resolution of any adverse events associated 
with the ImageReady System implant, then withdrawn from the study . 
11.3.5 Implan t 
Implant  refers to a subject who is successfully implanted with the ImageReady System per 
the study protocol. These subjects are followed in accordance with the follow -up schedule 
and included in all analyses of safety and performance.

Page 43 of 128  11.3.6 Existing Implant  
Existing Implant  refers to a subject who has a complete ImageReady System implanted 
prior to enrollment, per the study protocol. These subjects are followed in accordance with 
the follow -up schedule and included in all analyses of safety and performance.  
11.4 Enrollment Controls   
A total of 500 subjects  at up to 70 investigational centers  will be enrolled in this study .   
11.4.1 Phase  I 
• To support regulatory requirements and an interim analysis, subjects will initially be  
into Phase I until Phase I is stopped. After that, enrolled subjects will be considered 
Phase II subjects.  
• An interim analysis planned for phase I when 20 subjects have completed their 
protocol required scan and MRI +1 Month visit. It is estimated that approximately 37 
subjects (assuming 45% a ttrition) enrolled into Phase I will contribute to this interim 
analysis.  
• Phase I Cohort completion is anticipated when:  
o 137 CRT -D and 28 VR subjects are enrolled and have been through their MRI 
Visit (complete or incomplete MR scan)   
and 
o A total of 25 VF  episodes  post MRI  from 25 different subjects are available 
from spontaneous episodes, from “for -cause” VF induction, and from the VF 
Induction Sub- study, combined (as defined in section 12.8.2)  
 
• One individual center may not enroll more than 43  subjects  for Phase I without prior 
approval from Boston Scientific. 
• A minimum of 50% of  total enrollments from the US will be maintained  
• Investigational sites will be notified when enrollment into Phase I are complete.  
   
11.4.2 Phase II  
Sites will be notified by BSC whe n enrollments into Phase II may begin. Phase II will start at 
the conclusion of Phase I. Phase I patients who do not have the study -required scan will 
automatically be rolled into Phase II . Investigational centers may continue to enroll until the 
total enr ollment ceiling of 500 subjects has been reached.  
One individual center may not enroll more than 20% (100 subjects ) of the total enrollment 
ceiling of 500 subjects without prior approval from Boston Scientific.

11.5 End-of-Study Action Plan  
Boston Scientific Corporation reserves the right to terminate the study, or discontinue 
implanting at any stage but intends to exercise this right only for valid scientific or 
administrative reasons and reasons related to the protection of subjects. In the  event of this 
occurrence, BSC will communicate to the investigators of the ENABLE MRI Clinical Study. 
The investigators will be responsible for communicating any information necessary to the 
subjects. BSC will support the physicians by providing recommendations for ensuring the 
safety of the subjects and the handling of any investigational components of the ImageReady 
System in the  US until those components are approved by the FDA, which may include, but 
are not limited to: 
• Standard of care procedures  
• More  frequent follow ups of the subject than per standard procedures  
• Longer term follow up (beyond length of initial consent)  
• Explantation of  RELIANCE 4 -FRONT or ACUITY X4 leads  upon careful risk-
benefit analysis   
• Other possible actions  
If it becomes apparent  that any of the investigational products will not be FDA -approved, a 
communication and study action plan for the subjects with those unapproved devices will be 
implemented.    
12. Study Methods

Boston Scientific will collect information to document potential subjects who are considered 
as potential study candidates but are determined not to meet inclusion criteria prior to signing 
informed consent.  
12.3 Informed Consent  
All subjects who complete the informed consent proces s, sign and date the informed consent 
form will be evaluated for the following criteria: 
• Radiologist approval to undergo MRI scan if metal objects in body (exclusion 
criterion #3)  
• 12 lead ECG and 10s rhythm strip (either from the ECG machine or the BSC PRM ) 
(exclusion criterion #5)  
Source documentation for both of these exclusion criteria need to be retained in the patient 
medical file.  
Subjects who meet these exclusion criteria will be considered Consent ineligible and will not 
count toward the enrollment ceiling.  
Subjects who do not meet these exclusion criteria will be considered enrolled in the 
ENABLE  MRI study and will count toward the enrollment ceiling.     
In addition, subjects who meet none of the exclusion criteria for the VF Induction Sub- study 
and undergo the VF Induction Sub- Study informed consent process, sign, and date the 
ENABLE MRI VF Induction Sub- study informed consent form are considered enrolled in the 
Sub- study.   
For Phase I de novo implants: Enrollment may occur up to 30 days prior to t he implant 
procedure.  
A summary of the data collected at enrollment is described in Table 12- 1. The following

The MRI follow -up visit consists of data collection and MR scan.  
For Phase I de novo subjects, t he visit will occur 6 to 9 weeks (42- 63 days) after implant or 
surgical revision of the ImageReady System implant*.   
For Phase I exis ting implant subjects, the visit will occur within 6 weeks  (42 days) from 
enrollment  AND at least 6 weeks after implant or surgical intervention * of the ImageReady 
System . For example:   
• If the subject was enrolled with an ImageReady S ystem  that was implanted >6 weeks 
before enrollment , the MRI visit must  occur within 6 weeks  (42 days) . 
• If the subject was enrolled with the an ImageReady S ystem that was implanted 2 
weeks (14 days) before enrollment, the MRI visit must  occur between 4 – 6 week s 
(28 to 42 days)   after enrollment.  
*Note:  If a subject has had a surgical revision to their ImageReady System (i.e., a lead 
revision/ reposition), and the MRI Visit is unable to be scheduled within the time window, 
the MRI Visit and the MRI + 1 Month Vis it are not required. Enter the reason for MRI Visit

• Sensing amplitude  
• Impedance  
• Shock impedance (RV lead only)  
2. Test for phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) and measure the PNS threshold if detected in 
the programmed LV lead configuration  
3. Perform an a ssessment of Beeper function  as defined in section 12.7.1.1. 
4. Print the ‘Quick Notes’ Report  
Record the measurements in the EDC system.  
12.7.1.1 Assessment  of Beeper function  
To test if the Beeper is audible,  
1. Program Magnet Response to Inhibit T herapy  
2. Place the magnet  over the PG for a minimum of 5 seconds  but not for more than 20 
seconds in a quiet environment. 
• If the Tachy mode is programmed to ‘Monitor + Therapy’: A short beep may be 
heard once every second, as long as  the magnet is placed ove r the PG.  
• If the Tachy mode is programmed to ‘Monitor only’ or ‘OFF’: A continuous beep 
may be heard as long as  the magnet is placed over the PG.  
Note: The Magnet Sensor will detect Guidant/Boston Scientific CRM magnets (donut, 
horseshoe or wrist) within 3 cm. The Magnet Sensor will detect a 60 G < field ≤300 G, 
when applied perpendicularly to the surface of the PG, either face.   
3. The subject and the HCP will be  asked to indica te whether the B eeper is audible to them.   
4. If not audible, by either the subject or the HCP, a second attempt at assessing Beeper 
function will be performed. The B eeper should be assessed in the alternate Tachy mode  
(as listed in step 2)  if tolerated by the subject.  
5. Record if the B eeper was audible by the subject and the HCP  in the EDC. .

Subjects must meet the MRI Conditions of Use, comprised of Cardiology and Radiology 
Conditions of Use, as  listed in the BSC  MRI Tech nical Guide  and Section 6 of this protocol. 
Documentation of both the Cardiology and Radiology MRI Conditions of Use assessment  
must be included. 
Note: Subjects must satisfy the MRI Conditions of Use prior to receivin g the study -required 
MR scan; otherwise a protocol deviation shall  be assessed.  
 
12.7.2.2 Subject History of Unexplained Syncope  
Prior to the MR Scan, subjects should be questioned or a current medical history review 
should occur to determine if there is any histor y of unexplained syncope  (loss of 
consciousness) .  If confirmed, the subject should not proceed with the study -required  MR 
scan and be withdrawn from the study.  
 
12.7.2.3 Heart Rhythm  Monitoring  prior to MRI protection mode programming   
It is required  that the heart rhythm be monitored by the site P rincipal Investigator  or a sub-
investigator for all subjects prior  to initiation of the MR I Protection Mode and the MR Scan.  
• Monitoring is to be performed in VVI 40 programming  
• Monitor the heart rhythm using the programmer EGRAMs  for at least 5 minutes. 
Heart rate and any abnormal rhythms , including incidence of ectopy  shall  be 
documented.  
o In particular, l ook for signs  of progressive  A V nodal block over time , 
permanent or intermittent complete AV block, or trifascicular block 
(alternating bundle branch block or PR > 200 ms with LBBB or other 
bifascicular block) or a paced event (one single paced beat) during this time 
period. Any  occurrence of these events will disqualify subjects  from 
undergoing the MRI .  
 Such subjects should be withdrawn from the study.  
o Required ECG documentation 
 12 lead ECG  and a 10s rhythm strip to be printed at any time during 
the 5 minutes of the monitoring  (either from the ECG machine or the 
BSC PRM)  
 Any abnormal rhythms / ectopy shall be documented with a printed 
ECG or rhythm strip  if possible .

Page 58 of 128  12.7.3 MR Scans  
The MR scan must be performed within the guidelines of this protocol  and the BSC MRI 
Tech nical  Guide . When differences exist, the ENABLE MRI Study protocol extends the BSC 
MRI Technical Guide.  
MRIs must be performed in 1.5 Tesla, closed bore scanners with body coil excitation.  
Subjects will complete MR scans per the MR scan sequences protocol in Section 28 of this 
protocol. 
Note:  Incidental findings are defined as a “finding concerning an individual research 
participant that has potential health or reproductive importance and is discovered in the 
course of conducting resear ch but is beyond the aims of the study10”. The MR scans required 
by the ENABLE MRI S tudy are not intended for diagnostic purposes. Therefore, they are not 
intended or required to be read by trained radiologists. If the site’s MR technician performing 
the scan determines any incidental findings, or if a site’s procedures dictate that MR scans 
must be read, any incidental findings must be reported to the site’s primary investigator by 
the person who reads  the scan.  
Additionally, it is important to note that th e Image Artifact core lab (see Section 14.3) will 
not be required or requested to report incidental findings to BSC or the investigator, and BSC 
will not be reviewing any images received for diagnostic or incidental finding purposes.  
Site investigators must make it clear through the patient informed consent process that the 
MR scans required by the ENABLE MRI  Study are for research only. They are not intended 
for diagnostic purposes, and will not necessarily be viewed by trained professionals. 
12.7.3.1 Programming MRI Protection Mode  
Prior to undergoing an MR scan, the ImageReady System must be programmed to the MRI 
Protection Mode using the PRM. The PRM is to be kept ON and in MRI Zone I or II as close 
to the MRI room as possible. 
WARNING: The PRM is MR Unsafe  and must remain outside the MRI site Zone III (and 
higher) as defined by the American College of Radiology Guidance Document for Safe MR 
Practices11. Under no circumstances should the PRM be brought into the MRI scanner room, 
(Zone IV), or the control room (Zone III) . Programming  the PG to MRI Protection Mode 
should be done as close to the planned start of the MR scan as possible . 
1. Start monitoring the subject as outlined in section 12.7.3.3 
2. Program the MRI Protection Time -out (nominal setting: 6 hours; programmable 
values are OFF, 3, 6, 9, 12 hours)

a. If the Time -out feature is used, the report includes the exact time  and date 
when MRI Prot ection M ode will expire.  If the Time -out feature is used, the 
MRI technologist/radiologist must verify  that adequate time  remains to 
complete the scan  and to exit the MR scanner room . 
Please refer to the BSC MRI Tech nical  Guide  for more information regarding PG MRI 
Protection Mode programming and other associated MRI warnings, cautions, and potential 
adverse events.  
12.7.3.2 Heart Rhythm Monitoring after MRI protection mode programming  
It is required  that the heart rhythm be monitored by the site P rincipal Investigator  or a sub-
investigator for all subjects after programming MRI protection mode ON and prior  to 
initiation of the MR Scan.  
• Monitor the heart rhythm  for at least 5 minutes  using the monitoring equipment 
screen . Heart rate and any abnormal rhythms, including incidence of ectopy shall be 
documented.  
o In particular, look for signs  of progressive  AV nodal block over time , 
permanent or intermittent complete AV block, or trifascicular block 
(alternating bundle branch block or PR > 200 ms with LBBB or other 
bifascicular block) or a sinus pause > 2s during this time period. Any  
occurrence of these events will disqualify subjects from undergoing the MRI.  
 For such subjects, MRI protection mode must be turned OFF. These 
subjects should be withdrawn from the study.  
 
12.7.3.3 Monitoring of Subjects during the MR I Protection Mode   
Subjects must be continuously monitored by the site  Principal Investigator  or a sub-
investig ator for the entire duration in which the PG  is in MRI Protection Mode . All subject 
monitoring must  be documented (visual and auditory cues are acceptable when the subject is 
being connected to the equipment defined below) . 
For the entire duration that the PG is in MRI Protection Mode, the following will be 
performed : 
1. Investigational c enters must utilize continuous monitoring of all of the following 
a. ECG ( minimum of a 3- lead ECG is required ) 
b. Pulse oximetry with waveform monitoring (non- impedance based Finger 
plethysmography)  
c. Blood pressure  
C1734   Confidential  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 60 of 128  NOTE: Both the ECG and pulse oximeter alarms should be turned to the ON 
position on the monitoring machine  for the entire duration of the MR scan.  
2. Ensure t hat an external defibrillator and medical personnel trained in external 
defibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  are present  
3. Subjects must be continuously monitored by the site  Principal Investigator  or a sub-
investigator  trained in monitori ng hemodynamic stability using ECG, pulse oximetry 
and blood pressure , along with  maintaining normal voice and visual contact . 
4. In addition, for the entire duration of the MR scan , the following will be 
performed:  
a. The heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation levels will be 
documented in 5 ± 2 minutes intervals.  
b. ECG and pulse oximeter alarms must be ON   
c. It is recommended that a rhythm strip is printed at each interval.  
d. If there are any abnormal rhythms, a rhythm strip to document the abnormal 
rhythm should be printed  if possible .  
12.7.3.4 MR Scan Sequences Protocol   
Refer to Table 28- 1 in Section 28 for the MR Scan Sequences Protocol.  
The following data is required to be collected : 
1. Medications used for sedation in the MR scanner, if applicable  
2. MR Scanner manufacturer and model  
3. Time of MR scan initiation  
4. Time duration for each sequence within the RF intensive and Gradient intensive scans  
5. Total duration of RF intensive scan sequences  
6. Total duration of Gradient intensive scan sequences  
7. Time of MR scan co mpletion  
12.7.3.5 Exiting the MRI Protection Mode  
Upon completion of the MR scan, program the PG out of the MRI Protection Mode by 
interrogating the device using the wand (RF telemetry is disabled in MRI Protection Mode) . 
It is recommended to program the PG out of MRI Protection Mode as close to the end of MR 
scan as possible . 
• Document the Time of exiting MRI Protection Mode. 
Note: The PRM is MR Unsafe and must remain outside the MRI site Zone III (and higher). 
Under no circumstances should the PRM be brought into the MRI scanner room, the control 
room, or the MRI site Zone III or IV areas.  
C1734   Confidential  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 61 of 128  Upon exit ing the MRI Protection Mode, all parameters are restored to pre -MRI Protection 
Mode values with two exceptions:   
• Restoration of function of the Minute Ventilation12 (MV) sensor is delayed. If MV was 
programmed to O N or Passive at the time of entry into MRI Protection Mode, upon exit 
from the mode, an automatic six hour calibration of the sensor will begin. MV -driven rate 
response is not available during this calibrati on period. If MV -driven rate response is 
desired sooner, a manual calibration can be performed.  
• The Beeper will remain OFF upon exiting MRI Protection Mode.  
12.7.4 Device Evaluation after the MR Scan   
1. All implanted leads will be evaluated  within two hours upon exit from the MRI 
Protection Mode  through the implanted PG for THREE  separate consecutive sets of 
measurements  using the test parameters listed in Table 12- 3: 
• Manual pacing threshold tests, as defined in sections 12.5.1.1, 12.5.1.2 and 12.5.1.3. 
Sensing amplitude  
• Impedance  
• Shock impedance (RV lead only)  
2. Test for phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) and measure the PNS threshold if detected in 
the programmed LV lead configuration  
3. Perform an a ssessment of Beeper function  as defined in section 12.7.1.1. After 
performing the assessment of the Beeper, if the Beeper is audible, the user may choose to 
manually re- enable the Beeper.  
Record the measurements in the EDC system.  
12.7.5 Completing the MRI Visit  
1. The PG data must be reviewed to document whether  any episodes of polymorphic or 
monomorphic VT or VF that required ATP or shock therapy are present , following 
the MR scan .

12.8.2 VF Induction 
Subjects who successfully complete the study requi red MR I scan and either qualify for the 
“for-cause” VF induction or consented to be part of the VF induction Sub- study will undergo 
a VF Induction.  
“For cause” VF induction is required if the below criteria are met  at the MRI + 1 Month 
Visit:  
• A reduction in the RV lead R -wave amplitude of >  50% post -MRI, as measured at the 
MRI + 1 Month Visit compared to the pre MRI value collected during the MRI Visit, 
with a RV lead R wave that is greater than or equal to 5 mV post -MRI as measured 
during the MRI + 1 Mont h Visit 
“For cause” VF inductions are ideally performed at the MRI + 1 Month Visit, but may be 
performed up to 14 calendar days after the MRI +  1 Month Visit .  
Subject s will be assessed for clinical stability prior to performing the VF induction  testing 
(both those subjects who qualify for the “for -cause induction and those who are part of the 
VF induction Sub- study) , per physician discretion. The following criteria should be 
considered prior to performing VF Induction testing:

12.11.2 Recommended Data Collection  
1. It is recommended to conduct a device evaluation:  
• Manual pacing threshold tests  
• Sensing amplitude  
• Impedance  
• Shock impedance (RV lead only)  
2. For all additiona l visits after an MR scan, the PG data should be reviewed to document 
whether any new episodes of polymorphic or monomorphic VT or VF that required ATP 
or shock the rapy are present since the prior study visit.  
a. If polymorphic or monomorphic VT or VF episodes are present:  
i. Print the ‘Arrhythmia Logbook’ and ‘Selected Episodes Report’ (counters 
and EGMs) using the PRM  
ii. A copy of the Selected Episode Report(s) with counters and EGMs is 
expected to  be submitted to Boston Scientific within 5 business days  
using the upload tool in the EDC system  
iii. If a physical copy of the Selected Episode Report(s) is to be submitted 
(instead  of an electronic upload), the copy is expected to  be submitted to 
the ECG Core Lab within 5 business days  
3. Perform a Save All:  
a. Save device data to a USB using the programmer “Save All” feature  
b. Label the USB with the subject ID#, Date, and “Additional Follow -up” 
c. Retain the original USB at the center, and a copy is expected to be submitted to 
Boston Scientific within 5 business days  using the upload tool in the EDC system  
i. If a physical copy of the USB is to be submitted (instead of an electronic 
upload) use a  PC to make the copy and label it the same way as the 
original. Do not make a copy by using the programmer a second time 
as this will create a new USB  with slightly different information.

12.12  Medically Necessary MR I Visits  
During the study, if  a subject needs a medically necessary MR scan, BSC recommends  the 
subject be directed to have the scan at the Study site. 
Note: In case the medically necessary MR scan  is performed at a non- investigational site , all 
efforts must be made to collect the data  and adhere to the MRI Conditions of Use.  
Study flow is ident ical to the MRI visit as describ ed in section 12.7. Some data collection is 
optional for Medically Necessary MRI visit as shown in italic in Table 12- 11. 
For medically necessary MRI scans,  all activities performed by the site Principal Investigator 
or a sub- investigator at the MRI visit (i.e. heart rhythm monitoring, hemodynamic 
monitoring) c an be performed by a trained and qualified H ealth C are P rofessional (HCP).   
As for the MRI visit, it is recommended to have a programmer  powered ON  in Zone II near 
the MRI room in case the patient develops the urgent need for pacing.

12.13 Study Completion  
Subjects will be followed until completion of the 3 -year annual follow -up visit. In the US, if 
a subject receives an investigational lead(s) that is not approved by the FDA before the 3-
year annual follow -up, then the subject will be followed until the investigation lead(s) is 
approved, explanted, or until study closure. Upon completion of participation in the study, 
subjects will be followed per normal standard of care.  
13.  Statistical Considerations  
13.1 Endpoints (Phase I only)  
All Phase I subject s who consent to be part of the VF Sub- study  or require a “for -cause” VF 
induction will contribute  to the ancillary analysis  of VT/VF assessment . 
13.1.1 Primary Safety Endpoint: MR Scan -Related ImageReady System Complication 
Free Rate  
The primary safety endpoint will be asses sed for all subjects who undergo any portion of the 
study -required MR scan sequences.  Safety will be confirmed by evaluating the MR scan -
related ImageReady System  Complication -free rate (CFR) between the MR Scan and the 
MRI Visit + 1 Month. For the purpose  of this endpoint, a MR scan -related ImageReady 
System complication will be defined as those complications that are  related to the MR scan 
and ImageReady System . All complications that the site reports as related to the MR scan 
and ImageReady System will be adjudicated by an external committee for relation to the MR 
scan. Complications that are determined to be associated with the MR scan will be 
considered MR scan -related complications and count against this endpoint. 
13.1.1.1 Hypotheses  
The following hypotheses w ill be used to evaluate the Primary Safety Endpoint:  
H0: The MR Scan -related CFR rate between MR Scan and MRI Visit + 1 Month ≤  
90%  
HA: The MR Scan -related CFR rate between MR Scan and MRI Visit + 1 Month > 
90%.

Page 75 of 128  13.1.1.2 Sample Size  
The sample size of 155 CRT -D subjects is driven by primary LV effectiveness endpoint 2.  
Additionally 40 VR ICD subjects will also be enrolled to represent the worst case scenario 
for lead heating.  This results in a total 195 enrolled subjects.  Given the assumed attrition 
rate of 30%,  a total of 137 subjects with MR scans are expected. Since a power calculation 
cannot be directly calculated for a one group Kaplan -Meier analysis, an exact test was used. 
A power calculation using sample size of 137 subjects with MR scans was calculated b ased 
on a one -sided exact test for a single binomial proportion, using SAS Version 9.2 with the 
following assumptions:  
• Performance goal = 90%  
• Expected MR Scan -related CFR rate between MR Scan and MRI visit + 1 month = 
97.5%  
• Significance level = 2.5%  
These assumptions result in a power level of 94.3 %. 
13.1.1.3 Statistical Methods  
Endpoint analysis will be performed on all subjects that undergo an MR scan (study sequence 
is initiated), including subjects that have an incomplete scan. However, if a medically 
necessary scan occurs between implant and the MRI + 1 Month Visit, data for that subject 
will not be included in this endpoint. 
The MR Scan -related complication -free rate from the date of the MRI Visit through 31 days 
post-MR scan will be calculated using Kaplan -Meier methodology. The 97. 5% one -sided 
lower pointwise confidence limit of the complication -free rate will be calculated via log -log 
methodology and compared to the performance goal of 90%  11, 12,13,14,15. If the lower 
confidence limit exceeds 9 0%, the nul l hypothesis will be rejected.  
The Kaplan -Meier methodology was chosen for this endpoint to utilize all available data for 
each subject. Subjects, who did not undergo an MR scan, i.e., the study sequence was not 
initiated, will be considered to have missin g data. To assess the robustness of this analysis 
method and the potential impact missing data could have had on the analysis results, a 
tipping point analysis will be conducted that will include  enrolled  subjects . The tipping point 
analysis will assign ea ch subject with missing data as either having or not having a MR Scan-
related complication. All possible combinations of these patients’ data will be evaluated 
along with the actual observed data to find the point, if any, at which the endpoint is failed. 
13.1.2 Primary RV Effectiveness Endpoint 1: Pre- MR Scan  vs. 1 Month Post -MR Scan 
RV Pacing Threshold at 0.5 ms  
Increases in RV pacing threshold (at 0.5 ms) pre - MR scan  and 1 Month post -MR scan will 
be calculated for subjects. Subjects that have an increase in  average  pacing thresholds ≤ 0.5V 
(at 0.5 ms) from pre -MR Scan to MRI Visit + 1 Month follow -up will be considered a 
success.

Page 76 of 128  13.1.2.1 Hypotheses  
The following hypotheses will be used to evaluate the Primary  RV Effectiveness Endpoint 1:  
H0: The RV Pacing Threshold Success Rate ≤  87%  
HA: The RV Pacing Threshold Success Rate > 87%.  
13.1.2.2 Sample Size  
A sample size of 58 RV leads with paired threshold measurements is required to evaluate 
Primary RV Effectiveness Endpoint 1. This sample size was calculated based on a one -sided 
exact test for a single binomial proportion, using SAS Version 9.2 with the following 
assumptions:  
• Performance goal = 87%  
• Expected RV Pacing Threshold Success = 97%  
• Significance level = 5%  
• Power = 80%  
Given an expected attrition rate of 40%, 97 RV leads  are needed, in order to meet the sample 
size of  58 RV leads with paired threshold measurements. 
The 10% margin between the expected performance and the performance goal is based on 
prior confirmatory designs, where a difference in success rates between a control group and 
treatment group of 10%  was used in those studies11, 12,13,14,15. With  the intended study design 
each subject serves as their own control.  
13.1.2.3 Statistical Methods  
Multiple RV pacing threshold measurements taken at each of the two visits (MR I Visit and 
the MRI Visit + 1 Month) will be averaged to determine the average RV pacing threshold at 
each visit for each subject. The change in average pacing thresholds will then be calculated 
for each subject and compared to 0.5V to determine success or failure. Subjects that have an 
increase in average pacing thresholds (pre -MR Scan and at the MRI visit +  1 Month follow -
up) ≤ 0.5V will be considered a success. The  95% one -sided lower pointwise confidence 
limit of the RV pacing threshold success rate w ill be calculated using the one -sided exact 
methodology for a single binomial proportion and compared to the performance goal of 87%. 
If the lower confidence limit exceeds 87%, the null hypothesis will be rejected. 
All variations of RV leads and lead families will be pooled for this endpoint. 
Primary RV Effectiveness Endpoint 1 will be analyzed by per -protocol analysis. The per -
protocol analysis will only include subjects who received an MR Scan, and will not include 
subjects that meet any of the following exclusions:  
• Has a medically necessary scan between implant and the MRI  + 1 Month Visit  
• Fails to meet labeled MRI Conditions of Use

• Has an incomplete scan based on the ENA BLE MRI Study MR Scan Sequences  
The per -protocol analysis will consider the subjects without paired RV pacing threshold 
measurements as having missing data, in addition to any subject that meets an exclusion 
listed above. To assess the impact missing data could have had on the analysis results, a 
tipping point analysis will be conducted.  The analysis will assign each subject with missing 
data as either a failure or success. All possible combinations of these patients’ data will be 
evaluated along with the actual observed data to find the point, if any, at which the endpoint 
has failed.  
13.1.3 Primary RV Effectiveness Endpoint 2: Pre- MR scan  vs. 1 Month Post -MR Scan 
RV Sensed Amplitude  
Decreases in RV sensed amplitude pre -MR scan  and 1 Month post -MR scan  will be 
calculated for subjects. Subjects will be considered a success if the average sensed amplitude 
at the MRI + 1 Month Visit remains ≥ 5.0 mV and above 50% of the pre -MR s can value.  
Subjects who have a n average pre -scan RV sensed amplitude measurement < 5.0 mV will be 
excluded from this analysis. 
13.1.3.1 Hypotheses  
The following hypotheses will be used to evaluate the Primary  RV Effectiveness Endpoint 2:  
H0: The RV Sensed Amplitude Success Rate ≤  85%  
HA: The RV Sensed Amplitude Success Rate > 85%.  
13.1.3.2 Sample Si ze 
A sample size of 68 RV leads with paired RV amplitude measurements is required to 
evaluate Primary RV Effectiveness Endpoint 2. This sample size was calculated based on a 
one-sided exact test for a single binomial proportion, using SAS Version 9.2 with the 
following assumptions:  
• Performance goal = 85%  
• Expected RV Sensed Amplitude Success = 95%  
• Significance level = 5%  
• Power = 80%  
Given an expected attrition rate of 45%, 124 RV leads are needed , in order to meet the 
sample size of  68 RV leads with paired amplitude measurements.  
The 10% margin between the expected performance and the performance goal is based prior 
confirmatory study designs, where a difference in success rates between a control group and

13.1.3.3 Statistical Methods  
Multiple RV sensed amplitude measurements taken at each of the two visits (MR I Visit and 
the MRI + 1 Month Visit ) will be ave raged to determine the average RV sensed amplitude at 
each visit for each subject. The percent of subjects meeting the success criteria will be 
calculated. The  95% one -sided lower pointwise confidence limit of the RV sensed amplitude 
success rate will b e calculated using the one -sided exact methodology for a single binomial 
proportion and compared to the performance goal of 8 5%. If the lower confidence limit 
exceeds 8 5%, the null hypothesis will be rejected.

13.2 Ancillary Assessments  
The ancillary endpoints are not formal endpoints and are not statistically powered.   
13.2.1 Assessment of RV and LV Impedances  
The changes in RV and LV impedances pre- MR scan  versus  1 Month post -MR scan (MRI 
Visit and MRI + 1 Month Visit ) will be presented in the  study report.  There are no success 
criteria for impedances, so a failure rate will not be presented.  
13.2.2 Assessment of RA lead measurements  
The changes in RA lead measurements in cluding pacing thresholds, sensed amplitudes and 
impedances, between pre - and 1 Month post -MR scan measurements will be presented in the 
study report.  Also a summary by lead family, INGEVITY  MRI and  FINELINE II, will be 
presented.  There are no success cr iteria for RA lead measurements, so a failure rate will not 
be presented.  
13.2.3 Assessment on MR Scan Effect on Lead Measurements  
If a subject fails any of the effectiveness endpoints, it may indicate a potential MR scan 
effect on the corresponding lead for that  endpoint.  However if the same subject fails both the 
pacing threshold and sensed amplitude  effectiveness endpoints,  this would represent stronger 
evidence of MR Scan effect on the corresponding lead.  Summaries of the subjects failing

will be  included in the study report.  
13.2.4 Assessment of  VT/VF   
In Phase I, VT and VF episodes from the following three sources will be collected and 
analyzed:  
• Spontaneous VT/VF episodes  that required therapy  
• VT/VF episodes from “for -cause” VF induction  
• VF Induction Sub- study VT and VF episodes  
The VT/VF episodes will be evaluated by an ECG Core Lab. The performance objective is to 
demonstrate the continued ability of the ImageReady  MR Conditional Defibrillation  System 
to sense and detect VF post -MR scan (Phase I). Any instances of a detection  delay of  ≥5 
seconds  above the detection time expected , based on the VF rate and programming , will be 
further evaluated and the analysis will be provided. 
In addition, Boston Scientific plans to collect available spontaneous  VT/VF episodes post 
MR scan from Phase I and II subjects over a 3- year follow -up period. The VT/VF episodes 
will be evaluated by an ECG core lab. A summary of the results fr om the ECG core lab will 
be included in the study report. 
13.2.5 Assessment of Effect of Medically Necessary MR Scans  
Boston Scientific proposes to collect available data on medically necessary MR scans (MNS) 
from Phase I and II subjects over a 3- year follow -up period. A summary of changes in lead 
measurements pre-  to post - MNS and any MNS related complications will be presented.  
To assess the additive effect of multiple MR scans, the same summaries will be done for 
subjects with multiple MR scans.  
13.2.6 Assessment of  Beeper Function  
As the beeper function may be affected by the MR Scan ner static magnet field , beeper 
functionality  will be summarized using descriptive statistics , for pre - and post -scan, for both

13.2.7 Assessment of  Programming the MRI Protection Mode   
In order to understand the use of the MRI Protection Mode, the following time durations will 
be summarized using descriptive statistics for both study -related MR scans and medically 
necessary MR scans:  
• Duration of t he PG in the MRI Protection Mode  
• Time from the start of the MRI Protection Mode to the start of the MR scan  
• Time from the end of the MR scan to exiting the MRI Protection Mode

Page 83 of 128  13.2.8 Assessment of Image Artifacts for non -medically necessary MR scans  
The image artifact core laboratory will evaluate the MR scan image artifacts in a subset of 
the non- medically necessary MR scan images  from Phase I of the study. The  results from the 
core lab analysis will be summarized in the study report.  
13.3 Sample Size Su mmary  
The study will enroll a total of 500 subjects.  
The estimated sample size for Phase I is based on th e following assumptions :    
• The sample size for the interim analysis cohort is approximately 37 subjects, in order 
to have 20 subjects who have comple ted the protocol MRI required scan and 
completed the MRI + 1 Month visit.  This assumes an attrition rate of 45%. The 
interim analysis will be performed  when  data for 20 subjects who successfully 
complete the MR scan and the MR+1 Month Visit are available.   
• The sample size for the endpoint analyses is based on the MR Scan -related CFR 
endpoint (Primary Safety) as it requires 28 VR-ICD subjects in addition to the 
required 137 CRT -D subjects  to undergo the study required MR scan ( based on the 
primary LV Effectiveness Endpoint 2) .   
The sample size for the whole study was chosen at up to 500 subjects in order to observe 30 
spontaneous VT/VF episodes post MRI scan.  
13.4 General Statistical Methods  
13.4.1 Control of Systematic Error/Bias  
Selection of patients will be ma de from the Investigator’s usual patient load. All patients 
meeting the eligibility criteria and having signed the ICF will be eligible for enrollment in the 
study. To control for inter -observer variability among sites, an independent Clinical Events 
Committee (CEC) will determine the MR Scan -related ImageReady System complications to 
be used in the analysis of the Primary Safety Endpoint.     
13.4.2 Control of Type I Error  
Each primary effectiveness endpoint s can be tested at the significance level of 5% and the 
primary safety endpoint can be tested at the significance level of 2.5% while still maintaining 
the overall type I error level at no greater than 5%. This follows the methodology of the 
Intersection -Union Test (IUT).   
13.4.3 Number of Subjects per Investigative Site  
To avoid any center effect and bias, one center will not be authorized to implant or attempt 
more than 100 subjects ( 20% of the maximum number of subjects ).   
13.5 Data Analyses  
The following data analyses are planned for the ENABLE MRI  Clinical Study : 
C1734   Confidential  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 84 of 128  13.5.1 Interim Analyses  
No formal interim analyses are planned for the purpose of stopping the study early for 
declaring effectiveness or for futility. The interim analysis being conducted on 20 subjects is 
to support regulatory requirements  and submissions . Analysi s of each endpoint will be 
performed when all applicable data for that endpoint has been collected.  
13.5.2 Pooling Analyses  
13.5.2.1 Assessment of Pooling Across Device Type  
The single chamber ICDs and the CRT -Ds are expected to perform similarly regarding any 
effect of MRI on RV pacing threshold or RV sensed amplitude as well MR Scan- related 
complications. Any effects of MRI on tissue surrounding each respective electrode des ign are 
expected to be proportionally similar. Therefore, device (PG and lead)  type will be pooled for 
the analyses of all endpoints. Additionally, analysis will be performed for each of the primary 
safety and effectiveness endpoints 1 and 2 to verify pool ability. To assess the impact of 
device type on each endpoint, a likelihood ratio test from a regression model will be 
conducted. The regression model may  include additional baseline covariates to attempt to 
adjust for any imbalances between the device typ e groups, and will examine the effect of 
device type. The following baseline covariates may  be considered for inclusion: age, gender, 
height, weight and geography. The likelihood ratio test will compare the log likelihoods 
between a model containing device  type as a covariate and a model not containing device 
type as a covariate. The test will be performed at an α equal to 15%. Endpoint results will be 
presented for each device type regardless of the poolability analysis results.  
13.5.2.2 Assessment of Pooling Acros s Geographies and Investigational Centers   
In addition to testing the poolability of data by device type, the poolability of data by 
geography and investigational center will be tested. These analyses will be performed to 
determine whether there are differ ences between the US and international geographies , and 
from center -to-center.  
A minimum of 50% of Phase I patients will be from the US. Center -to-center heterogeneity 
will be assessed for each endpoint by performing random effects logis tic regression anal yses.   
Centers enrolling 5 subjects or fewer will be combined  within region (US versus OUS)  into 
pooled site s of 6 or more subjects  for the purpose of this pooling analysis.  
Investigational center will be added into the model as a random effect. Centers wi ll be 
deemed to be heterogeneous if the variance of the random center effect is found to 
significantly differ from zero. A significance level of 15% will be used for each test.   
13.5.2.3 Assessment of Pooling Across protocol versions  
The inclusion/exclusion criter ia have been updated with version AE.  T he poolability of data 
of subjects enrolled under version AE or later will be compared to subjects enrolled under all 
prior versions of the protocol.  
C1734   Confidential  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 85 of 128  To assess the impact of the protocol version on each endpoint, a likelihood ratio test from a 
regression model will be conducted. The regression model may include additional baseline 
covariates to attempt to adjust for any imbalances between the device type groups, and will 
examine the effect of protocol version. The following baseline covariates may be considered 
for inclusion: age, gender, height, weight and geography. The likelihood ratio test will 
compare the log likelihoods between a model containing protocol version as a covariate and a 
model not containing protocol version as a covariate. The test will be performed at an α equal 
to 15%. Endpoint results will be presented for each protocol version regardless of the 
poolability analysis results. 
13.5.3 Subgroup Analyses  
Analyses will be performed for each primary endpoint t o determine whether significant 
differences exist in endpoint results between subgroups. The list of subgroups (with 
applicable definitions in parentheses) includes, but is not necessarily limited to:  
• Device Type (Single Chamber ICD vs. CRT -D) – note that this analysis will not be 
done for Primary Effectiveness Endpoint 3 or 4,  
• Sex (Female vs. Male),  
• Geography (International vs. United States),  
• Age (< 65 years vs. ≥ 65 years).  
The subgroup variable will be added to a logistic regression model. For effectiveness 
endpoints, treatment and an interaction term of subgroup and treatment will be added as well. 
A test for significance at the 15% level will be performed. For each subgroup variable in 
which a significant difference exists, the results for each subgroup will be presented 
separately. BSC does not plan to seek labeling for these subgroups based on these analyses.  
13.5.4 Multivariate Analyses  
Analyses of various baseline covariates and their relationship to each endpoint are outlined 
above. For each endpoint, all baseline characteristics found to be significantly associated 
with the outcome will be included as covariates, along with treatment group, in a multivariate 
regression model . The impact of each baseline characteristic’s subgroups will be presented 
along with the multivariate model results.    
13.5.5 Changes to Planned Analyses  
Any changes to the planned statistical analyses made prior to performing the analyses will be 
documented in an amended Statistical Analysis Plan approved prior to performing the 
analyses. Changes from the planned statistical methods after performing the analyses will be 
documented in the clinical study report along with a reason for the deviation.

14.1 Data Collection, Processing, and Review  
Subject data y will be recorded in a limited access secure electronic data capture (EDC) 
system.  
The clinical database will reside on a production server hosted by Medidata. All changes 
made to the clinical data  will be captured in an electronic audit trail and available for review 
by Boston Scientific Corporation or its representative. The associated RAVE software and 
database have been designed to meet regulatory compliance for deployment as part of a 
validated  system compliant with laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of clinical 
studies pertaining to the use of electronic records and signatures. Database backups are 
performed regularly.  
The Investigator provides his/her electronic signature on the appropriate electronic case 
report forms (eCRFs) in compliance with local regulations. A written signature on printouts 
of the eCRFs must also be provided if required by local regulation. Changes to data 
previously submitted to the sponsor require a new elec tronic signature by the Investigator 
acknowledging and approving the changes.  
Visual and/or electronic data review will be performed to identify possible data 
discrepancies. Manual and/or automatic queries will be created in the EDC system and will 
be issu ed to the site for appropriate response. Site staff will be responsible for resolving all 
queries in the database.  
14.2 Data Retention  
The Investigator or Investigational site will maintain, at the investigative site, in original 
format all essential study docu ments and source documentation that support the data 
collected on the study subjects in compliance with ICH/GCP guidelines.  Documents must be 
retained for at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application or until at least 2 
years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of the clinical investigation of the 
product. These documents will be retained for a longer period of time by agreement with 
BSC or in compliance with other local regulations. It is BSC’s responsibility to inform the  
Investigator when these documents no longer need to be maintained. The Investigator will 
take measures to ensure that these essential documents are not accidentally damaged or 
destroyed. If for any reason the Investigator withdraws responsibility for maintaining these 
essential documents, custody must be transferred to an individual who will assume 
responsibility and BSC must receive written notification of this custodial change.  
14.3 Image Artifact Core Laborator y  
An independent Image Artifact core laborator y will evaluate MR scan image artifact in the 
torso region in a subset of the MR scan images  collected during Phase I of the study. The 
core lab Radiologist will review a subset of the images from complete scans, based on the 
Scan Sequences Protocol in Sec tion 28.

20.3 Risks Associated with the Study Device(s)  
The implantable portion of the Ima geReady System includes the PG, the pace/ sense lead(s)  
and defibrillation lead . In the US, the ACUITY X4 LV pacing leads  and the RELIANCE 4-
FRONT leads  may  be investigational during a portion or the entire duration of the  study . The 
basic safety and effectiveness of these leads  are being studied in separate clinical stud ies for 
the US .  
The non- implantable portion of the ImageReady System includes the 2868 programmer 
software application v3.07 or later.  The MRI Protection  Mode provides for simplified device 
programming that is available through multiple programming steps of existing features and 
therefore does not result in additional risk.  
There are no additional risks associated with the ImageReady System, other than those 
included in Sections 20.1 and 20.2. There are additional risks associated with MR scanning 
of the ImageReady System as described in Section 20.4. 
 
20.4 Risks associated with Participation in the Clinical Study  
Phase I s ubjects will have the added risk of a study -required MR I scan. Phase II subjects and 
Phase I subjects will have the added risks and benefits associated  with a  MRI scan if they 
decide to undergo a medically necessary MR scan. Potential adverse events associated with 
an MR scan are minimized by assuring that the subject meets the MRI Conditions of Use.  
MRI scanning of patients  when the Conditions of Use are met could result in the following 
potential adverse events, as included in the BSC MRI Tech nical  Guide : 
• Arrhythmia induction  
• Bradycardia  
• Patient death  
• Patient discomfort due to slight movement or heating of the device  
• Syncope  
• Worsening heart failure  
MRI scanning of patients when the Conditions of Use are NOT  met could result in the 
following potential adverse events , as included in the BSC MRI Tech nical  Guide : 
• Arrhythmia induction  
• Bradycardia  
• Damage to the pulse generator and/or leads  
• Erratic pulse generator behavior  
• Inappropriate pacing, inhibition of pacing, failure to pace  
• Increased rate of lead dislodgement (within six weeks of implant or revision of 
system)  
• Irregular or intermittent capture or pacing  
C1734   Confidential  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 98 of 128  • Loss of defibrilla tion therapy  
• Pacing threshold changes  
• Patient death  
• Patient discomfort due to movement or heating of the device  
• Physical movement of pulse generator and/or leads  
• Sensing changes  
• Syncope  
• Side effects of pacing at a fixed high rate such as competition with intrinsic rhythms 
and arrhythmias. Competitive pacing may increase the rate of pacing induced 
arrhythmia until the  device is reprogrammed.  
• Worsening heart failure  
**Note: It is important to note that the risks listed in this section may lead to the subject 
requiring a partial or full pacing system replacement.  
20.4.1 Beeper  
The Beeper may  no longer be audible  following an MRI scan.  
The beeper provides: (1) an audible patient warning when potential therapy failure is 
detected between scheduled PG checks with a device- following physician, and (2) audible 
feedback to clinical personnel regarding the state of the PG such as, current tachycardia 
mode and when charging for shock therapy.  An inaudible beeper results in an increase of the 
associated risk.    
Refer to t he BSC MRI Tech nical  Guide  for more information on the Beeper. 
• The system proactively disables the programmable and non -programmable  Beeper 
options when MRI Protection Mode is programmed. The Beeper will remain Off 
upon exiting MRI Protection Mode. 
• In situ ations where the MRI scan did not occur, the Beeper can be re -enabled after 
exiting MRI Protection Mode. 
• Upon subsequent interrogations  with a PRM , a notification that the Beeper is disabled 
and the date MRI  Protection Mode was last programmed will be provided.  
• It is strongly recommended that patients are followed on LATITUDE NXT after 
an MRI scan if they are not already. LATITUDE NXT  performs a device check 
daily and provides notification for all safety -related beeper notifications. Otherwise, 
an in -clinic follow -up schedule of every three months is strongly recommended 
to monitor device performance.   
The following are situations that will no longer trigger the Beeper to emit audible tones once 
the device is programmed into MRI Protection Mode.

• Reversion of the PG to Safety Core Operation  
• PG Reset  
 
20.4.2 Risks Related to VF Induction T esting  
Risks related to the “for cause” or VF Induction Sub- Study testing are outlined below:  
List of Potential Risk Related to VF Induction Testing  
Acceleration/induction of atrial or ventricular 
arrhythmia  Inappropriate sensing 
Adverse reaction to induction testing  Signal interference with already implanted heart 
rhythm management device function or standard of 
care equipment  
Allergic/adverse reactions to medications, including 
anesthesia  Muscle stimulation  
Chest pain (angina)  Myocardial infarction  
Death  Reduced cardiac function  
Discomfort/pain during or after testing  Shunting current during defibrillation with internal or 
external paddles  
Heart Block  Stroke  
Heart Failure  Syncope  
Inappropriate pacing of the heart  
Inappropriate shock delivery  Non-elective Intubation  
 
20.5 Possible Interactions with Concomitant Medical Treatments  
The implantable lead(s)  of the ImageReady  System contain the steroid DXA, for the purpose 
of helping to reduce tissue inflammation response at the distal electrode. There are no data 
that show there are any drug interactions with this local steroid, or with any other portion of 
the ImageReady Sys tem. 
20.6 Risk Minimization Actions  
Additional risks may exist. Risks can be minimized through compliance with this protocol, 
performing procedures in the appropriate hospital environment, adherence to subject 
C1734   Confidential  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 100 of 128 selection criteria, close monitoring of the subject 's physiologic status during research 
procedures and/or follow -ups and by promptly supplying BSC with all pertinent information 
required by this protocol.  
As the Beeper may no longer be audible, it is strongly recommended that patients are 
followed on LATITUDE NXT after an MRI scan if they are not already. Otherwise, an 
in-clinic follow -up schedule of every three months is strongly recommended to monitor 
device performance.   
20.7 Anticipated Benefits  
Subjects may not receive any benefit from participating in  this study. However, medical 
science and future patients may benefit from their participation in this clinical study . 
20.8 Risk to Benefit Rationale  
Risk management activities, including hazard analyses and fault tree analysis, have been 
performed on the Image Ready System to identify and analyze known and foreseeable 
hazards (in both normal and fault conditions) and reasonably foreseeable sequences or 
combinations of events that could result from using this product and the risks associated with 
each hazard. Mit igations have been implemented in the design, processes, and/or labeling 
and instructions for use of the product to reduce the residual risk of each hazard as necessary 
and practicable. The hazard analysis has been reviewed and approved and the remaining r isks 
are acceptable when weighed against the intended benefits to the patient.  
21.  Safety Reporting  
All devices used as part of the ImageReady MR Conditional Defibrillation System will be 
referred to as the study device(s). A ll reportable events experienced by the study subject after 
informed consent, whether during or subsequent to the procedure, should be reported through 
the EDC system. However, in case of any issues where an alternative method of reporting is 
necessary (i.e.  the EDC is not available), please report the event (s) to Boston Scientific by 
sending the AE Notification Form to the following email address:  
enablemri.safety@bsci.com  
 
21.1 Events Reportable by Sites to Sponsor  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for determin ing the reportab ility of events.  
Reportable events include the following : 
• All Device Related Adverse Events  
C1734   Confidential  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 101 of 128 • All Cardiac Events Related Adverse Events  associated with an untoward medical 
occurrence  
o Pre-existing cardiac conditions are not considered reportable unless the 
condition has exacerbated  
• All Study Procedure Related Adverse Events  
• All MRI Scan Related Adverse Events , for both protocol required MR scans  and 
medically necessary scans  
• All Adverse Events Related to the use of the MRI Protection Mode  
• All Serious Ad verse Events (including death), regardless of causality  
o Planned hospitalizations for pre -existing conditions prior to enrolment are not 
considered a serious adverse event  
o Procedures required by the clinical investigational plan without serious 
deterioration in health are not considered a serious adverse event  
o For centers in Austria cancer must always be reported as a Serious Adverse 
Event  
• All Device Deficiencies  
• Unanticipa ted Adverse Device Effects/Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effects 
previousl y not defined in the physician manuals  
If it is unclear whether or not an event fits one of the above categories, or if the event cannot 
be isolated from the device, it should be submitted as an adverse event and/or device 
deficiency.  
Events reported to Boston Scientific during the study will be reviewed and reported to 
comply with applicable regulations ( relevant parts of ISO 14155: 2011 and/or 21 CFR Part 
812). Investigators will be asked to classify whether an adverse event is considered serious or 
non-serious, whether it is anticipated or unanticipated (meets USADE/ UADE definition) as 
defined in Table 21 -1 below, and whether it is considered device or procedure related, as 
defined in section 21.4.2. Any event that i s determined to be an unanticipated serious adverse 
device effect (USADE; ISO 14155: 2011) will also be considered an unanticipated adverse 
device effect (UADE; CFR Part 812), as defined in Table 21- 1 below.  
Death should not be recorded as an adverse event. Death should be recorded as an outcome 
of only one (1) serious adverse event.  
21.2 Event Definitions and Classification

Abbreviations: EC=Ethics Committee; IRB=Institutional Review Board  
 
Refer to Section 20 for the known risks associated with the study device(s).  
21.3 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
All devices are subject to occasional random problems or failures. These may manifest 
themselves in altered pacing or sensing characteristics. There are wide variations in the 
seriousness of the effects. Refer to the device(s) Physician's Manual for information 
regarding potential a dverse effects.  
If the unanticipated adverse device effect is serious or life- threatening, the Investigator is 
required to notify Boston Scientific, the IRB, and other regulatory authorities as required 
(e.g., Competent Authority if European center) as soon as possible, but no later than one 
business day after the Investigator first learns of the effect. For all other unanticipated 
adverse device effects, Boston Scientific and the IRB must be notified within ten business 
days.  
Boston Scientific will conduct an evaluation of all reported adverse events. If the event is 
determined to be an unanticipated adverse device effect, Boston Scientific personnel shall 
notify the Boston Scientific Regulatory department and initiate communic ation to all 
reviewing IRBs and participating Investigators within ten business days after initial notice is 
received.  
If Boston Scientific determines that an unanticipated adverse device effect presents an 
unreasonable risk to patients, the study shall be  terminated. The termination shall occur no

Page 104 of 128 later than five days after the termination decision is made and no later than 15 business days 
after Boston Scientific first received notice of the effect.  
21.4 Adverse Event Classification for FDA Reporting  
21.4.1 Observat ion/Complication  
Reported events  will be classified, by BSC personnel or trained authorized representatives as 
a clinical observation or complication; as defined in the Table 21- 2. 
Table 21- 2: Definition of Observation and Complication  
Clinical Event  Description  
Observation  Adverse event that was transient or reversible and corrected with non -invasive 
interventions, such as reprogramming or oral medications, or was resolved with no 
intervention or monitoring  
Complication  An adverse event that resulted in: death, serious injury* a, correction using invasive 
intervention**, or permanent loss of device fu nctions***.  
 
* Per 21 CFR 803.3(bb):  
1) Serious injury means an injury or illness that:  
i) Is life -threatening; 
ii) Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to 
body structure; or  
iii) Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclud e permanent impairment 
of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure.  
2) Permanent means, for purposes of this subpart, irreversible impairment or damage to a 
body structure or function, excluding trivial impairment or damage.  
** Invasive interve ntions are those in which treatment necessary to correct the adverse event 
is delivered by cutting or piercing of the skin or placing an instrument in a body cavity to 
provide therapy. Examples of invasive interventions (complication) include:  
• Surgical rev ision of a lead 
• Electrophysiology study in which an ablation is performed  
• Angiogram in which angioplasty or stent placement is performed  
• Intravenous medications  
• Blood transfusions  
• Intubation to provide respiratory support  
C1734   Confidential  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 105 of 128 • Chemical (pharmacologic) Cardioversion with IV sedation (This is a complication 
due to the IV antiarrhythmic medication used for the cardioversion.)  
Invasive procedures that are purely diagnostic in nature should not be considered as a 
complication. Examples of procedures that are  invasive, but not considered to be an 
intervention (observation), include:  
• Blood draw for laboratory analysis  
• Cardiac catheterization in which pressures are recorded, but without therapeutic 
interventions  
• Electrophysiology study to map arrhythmias, but wi thout therapeutic intervention 
• Transesophageal echo (TEE)  
• Electrical (external) Cardioversion with IV sedation (the IV sedation used is for 
patient comfort and not part of the treatment)  
Other invasive procedures may occur that are not strictly interventional and done for medical 
convenience rather than medical necessity. These are not considered to be an adverse event 
since they are not related to an undesirable clinical outcome. Examples include:  
• Foley catheter placed in anticipation of a prolonged procedure  
• Intravenous fluids or medications related to a diagnostic procedure  
***Permanent Loss of device Function is where a malfunction occurs in a manner which 
there is compromised therapy. For the purposes of this study the following definitions will be 
utilized:  
• Malfunction : failure of a device to meet its performance specifications, to perform its 
essential function, or otherwise perform as intended.  Performance specifications 
include claims made in the labeling of the device. (i.e. device is  not  functioning 
within labeling)  
• Malfunction with compromised therapy – Pulse Generator:  The condition when a 
device is found to have “malfunctioned”, in a manner that compromised pacing or 
defibrillation therapy (including complete loss or partial degradation) while implanted 
and in service.   
o Examples include (but are not limited to): sudden loss of battery voltage; 
accelerated current drain such that low battery was not detected before loss of 
therapy sudden malfunction during defibrillation therapy result ing in aborted 
delivery of therapy; intermittent malfunction where therapy is compromised 
while in the malfunction state

Page 106 of 128 21.4.2 Adverse Event Type Classification  
An Investigator is required to report all reportable events (as defined in Section 21.1) for this 
study . All adverse events must recorded in the Adverse Event case report form in the EDC 
system,, including an event description, suspected cause, co rrective action, and clinical 
outcome for the patient.  
Upon receipt of adverse event information, CRFs are reviewed by BSC personnel or trained 
authorized personnel. During the review process, the adverse event is classified as an 
observation or complicat ion and each event is coded according to the types below. 
Classifications and type descriptions will be included with the adverse event information in 
appropriate submissions to the regulatory agencies. If the opinions between the investigator 
and BSC diff er, both opinions will be reported, as appropriate.  
Table 21- 3: Adverse Event Types I -V Utilized for BSC AE Classification  
Type   Description  
Type I  Related to an investigational device, investigational procedure, investigational therapy, or 
procedure related to the implant of the investigational device.  
Type II  Related to the protocol or procedures specifically related to protocol testing that is not 
standard of care.  
Type III  Related to commercially available implanted components or commercially available 
features of an investigational device, or the procedure of a commercially available device  
Type IV  Related to a change in the patient’s condition or to therapies other than delivered by the 
implante d system.   
Type V  Comments Only  
 
21.4.3 Adverse Event Outcome Status  
Adverse Events when reported are assigned an outcome status by centers (such as 
Recovering/Resolving, Resolved with residual effects, etc.) depending on the nature of the 
event or the corrective action involved. When clinically appropriate, centers should work to 
close events that may not be resolvable during the term of the investigation.  
 
21.5 Subject Death Reporting  
A subject death during the study must be reported to Boston Scientific as soon as possible 
and, in any event, within three calendar  days of center notification. The center’s IRB/EC 
must be notified of any deaths in accordance with that center’s IRB/EC policies and 
procedures.  
Notification of death must include a detailed narrative (death letter) that provides 
detailed information describing the circumstances surrounding the death and is signed 
and dated by the Principal Investigator or authorized  sub-Investigator. A death 
C1734   Confidential  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 107 of 128 narrative in the local language is acceptable, and will be translated to English by BSC 
(signed by an authorized translator). The death narrative must include all of the 
following, if available:  
• Date and time of death  
• Place death  occurred  
• Immediate cause of death  
• Rhythm at the time of death, if known (include any available documentation)  
• Whether the death was related to the pulse generator, lead/catheter, clinical 
investigation, procedure, or patient condition 
• Whether or not the death was witnessed  
• Device status and/or activity at the time of death  
• Whether the subject had worsening heart failure  
• Any other circumstances surrounding the death  
• Approximate time interval from the initiating event to death (temporal course)  
• Investigator or co -Investigator signature and date  
Any information listed above that is unavailable or unknown must be specified as 
unavailable or unknown, as applicable, in the narrative. Also submit the following 
documentation:  
If the subject expired in the hospital:  
• A copy of the medical records for that admission (e.g., H & P, consults, test 
results, operative reports, and/or progress notes from the hospital chart)  
• Death certificate (if available)  
• Autopsy report (if applicable)  
If the subject expired outside of the hospital (e.g., home):  
• A copy of the most recent clinic visit (if not already submitted to Boston 
Scientific)  
• Death certificate (if available)  
Whenever possible, the PG should be interrogated. Investigational leads and related Boston 
Scien tific system comp onents (e.g., PGs) should be removed intact and returned promptly to 
Boston Scientific for analysis.  
The Clinical Events Committee (CEC) must review information regarding subject deaths, 
refer to section 23.1.  
21.6 Subject Death Classification  
The following definitions of each category, along with the Epstein article,13 are to be used by 
the Investigator when completing the Death Information sectio n. 
C1734   Confidential  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 108 of 128 I.         Primary Organ Cause  - The root problem that initiated the terminal event if multiple 
factors were involved, e.g., HF -  primary, renal failure -  secondary.  
A.  Cardiac  
1.   Arrhythmic  
2.  Pump Failure  - Death occurring in a patient with severe heart failure, refractory 
to medical therapy, in whom death is anticipated within days to two months. 
Often such patients are referred for hospice care, comfort care is provided and 
aggressive treatment is curtai led. The terminal event could be sudden and may 
be arrhythmic. This does not change the non- sudden, non- arrhythmic course 
that preceded the terminal event.  
3.   Ischemic  
a.   Acute MI  - Symptoms compatible with an acute coronary syndrome (chest 
pain, acute  dyspnea etc.), with evidence of myocardial necrosis as defined 
by: 
i. creatinine kinase (CK) ≥  2x upper limit of normal (ULN)  
and CK MB isoenzyme percent > ULN  
ii. troponin level ≥  2 x ULN  
Patients with an acute coronary syndrome and diagnostic ST -T wave 
changes (>2 mm ST elevation in two contiguous leads) will be included 
if the death occurs prior to enzyme confirmation.  
b. No Acute MI  - Patient has not met the enzymatic or electrocardiographic 
criteria for an acute myocardial infarction. The testing was done and came 
back negative. For example, a patient who survives an unstable angina 
episode long enough to provide documentation that they did NOT have an 
MI, e.g., cardiac enzyme confirmation.  
c. MI Unknown - Myocardial infarction suspected but data to prove or 
disprove are not available. Used to capture the patient who is suspected of 
having a probable MI but dies prior to the MI being documented. For 
example, chest pain > 20 minutes, or chest pain with a nondiagnostic ECG 
(LBBB), or chest pain of unknown duration.  
4.   Other Cardiac  
5.   Unknown  
B.  Noncardiac  
C.  Unknown  
II.        Temporal Course 
A.  Sudden -  death that occurred within one hour of onset of symptoms  
C1734   Confidential  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 109 of 128 B.  Non -Sudden -  death that occurred greater than one hour of onset of symptoms  
C.  Unknow n/Presumed Sudden -  This category should be used for patients who were 
not expected to die of other causes, and were not witnessed at the time of death. 
There must  be documentation of the patient’s condition within 24 hours prior to the 
event and there should be no acute change in the patient’s condition or 
circumstances leading up to the event. An example would be a stable patient who 
dies in his sleep. Patients can have worsening heart failure prior to the event and be 
included in this category, as long a s the severity of heart failure does not fit the

Not Related  Relationship to the device or procedures can be excluded when:  
- the event is not a known side effect of  the product category the device belongs to or 
of similar devices and procedures;  
- the event has no temporal relationship with the use of the investigational device or 
the procedures;  
- the serious event does not follow a known response pattern to the medical device (if 
the response pattern is previously known) and is biologically implausible;

21.9 Exceptions for Use of Investigational Feature at Non -Invest igational Sites – 
US Only  
While geographic stability is necessary at the time of enrollment, it is possible for conditions 
to change for the subject in which continuing follow -up at the investigational center may 
pose a challenge. Every attempt should be made to keep the patient ca re at the Investigational 
Center and under the care of a trained investigator.  
In order to protect patient safety, use of investigational feature (MRI Protection Mode) at 
non-investigational sites is not allowed without prior sponsor and IRB approval. Not ify 
sponsor as soon as possible to obtain approval, as the approval process may take time. Use of

Page 116 of 128 the investigational feature at a non -investigational site is considered a protocol deviation and 
needs to be reported appropriately.  
Use of investigational feature  will be considered for the following conditions:  
• Subject has sought medical attention at a non- investigational site and software use is 
intended to protect the health and welfare of the subject  
• Health of the subject prevents reasonably safe travel to an investigational site  
• Travel to investigational site presents a significant hardship on the subject (e.g. 
physical distance to an approved investigational site is too great, limited access to 
transportation to the investigational site, subject is und er inpatient care, or subject is 
seen frequently for recurring treatment, such as dialysis or chemotherapy, at another 
site and the investigator agrees to allow device interrogations at that site)  
• Subject refuses to return to the investigational center de spite being informed of the 
risks associated with seeking follow -up care at a non -investigational location  
• Urgent, unplanned medical attention of study subjects requiring the use of 
investigational software to protect patient safety supersedes such conside ration  
Upon use of the investigational feature at a non -investigational site, information is to be 
collected surrounding the circumstances of use of the investigational feature  and reported to 
Boston Scientific within 5 business days . 
Required documentati on: 
• Completion of the Investigational Software Use Form  
• Completion of the Deviation Form  
21.10 Boston Scientific Device Deficiencies  
All device deficiencies (including but not limited to failures, malfunctions, use errors, 
product nonconformities, and labeling errors) will be documented and reported to BSC. If 
possible, the device(s) should be returned to BSC for analysis. Instructions for returning the 
investigational device(s) will be provided. If it is not possible to return the device, the 
investigator shoul d document why the device was not returned and the final disposition of the 
device. Device failures and malfunctions should also be documented in the subject’s medical 
record.  
In addition, any Investigational Device Deficiency that might have led to a seri ous adverse 
event if a) suitable action had not been taken or b) intervention had not been made or c) if 
circumstances had been less fortunate should be reported. Following receipt, the 
investigator’s assessment is reviewed by internal BSC personnel. If th e opinions between the 
investigator and BSC differ, both opinions will be reported, as appropriate.

Page 117 of 128 NOTE: Device deficiencies  (including but not limited to failures, malfunctions, and product 
nonconformities ) are not to be reported as adverse events. Howev er, if there is an adverse 
event that results from a device deficiency , that specific event would be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF.  
21.11 Reporting to Regulatory Authorities / IRBs / ECs / Investigators  
BSC is responsible for reporting adverse event informati on to all participating investigators 
and regulatory authorities, as applicable.  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB/EC, and regulatory 
authorities of UADE and SAE as required by local /regional regulations . 
22. Informed Consent    
Subject participation in this clinical study is voluntary.  Informed Consent is required from 
all subjects or their legally authorized representative. The Investigator is responsible for 
ensuring that Informed Consent is obtained prior to the use of any investigational devices, 
study -required procedures and/or testing, or data collection.  
The obtaining and documentation of Informed Consent must be in accordance with the 
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, ISO 14155, any applicable national regulations, and 
local Ethics Committee and/or Regulatory authority body, as applicable. The ICF must be 
approved by BSC or it’s delegate (e.g. CRO), the center’s IRB/EC, or central IRB, if 
applicable.  
Boston Scientific will provide a study -specific template of the ICF to investigators 
participating in this study. The ICF template may be modified to meet the requirements of the 
investigative center’s IRB/EC.  Any modification requires approval from BSC prior to use of 
the form.  The ICF must be in a language understa ndable to the subject and if needed, BSC 
will assist the center in obtaining a written consent translation. Translated consent forms 
must also have IRB/EC approval prior to their use.  Privacy language shall be included in the 
body of the form or as a sepa rate form as applicable.   
The process of obtaining Informed Consent shall  at a minimum include the following steps, 
as well as any other steps required by applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidelines : 
• be conducted by the Principal Investigator or designee authorized to conduct the process,  
• include a description of all aspects of the clinical study that are relevant to the subject’s 
decision to participate throughout the clinical study,  
• avoid any coerci on of or undue influence of subjects to participate,  
• not waive or appear to waive subject’s legal rights, 
C1734   Confidential  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 118 of 128 • use native language that is non- technical and understandable to the subject or his/her 
legal representative,  
• provide ample time for the subject to consider participation and ask questions if 
necessary,  
• ensure important new information is provided to new and existing subjects throughout the 
clinical study.   
The ICF shall always be signed and personally dated by the subject or legal representative 
competent to sign the ICF under the applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidelines and by 
the investigator and/or an authorized designee responsible for conducting the informed 
consent process. If a legal representative signs, the subject shall be asked to provide informed 
consent for continued participation as soon as his/her medical condition allows. The original 
signed ICF will be retained by the center and a copy of the signed and dated document and 
any other written information must be given to th e person signing the form.  
Failure to obtain subject consent will be reported by BSC to the applicable regulatory body 
according to their requirements (e.g., FDA requirement is within 5 business days of learning 
of such an event). Any violations of the informed consent process must be reported as 
deviations to the sponsor and local regulatory authorities (e.g. IRB/EC), as appropriate.  
If new information becomes available that can significantly affect a subject's future health 
and medical care, that information shall be provided to the affected subject(s) in written form 
via a revised ICF or, in some situations, enrolled subjects may be requested to sign and date 
an addendum to the ICF. In addition to new significant information during the course of a 
study,  other situations may necessitate revision of the ICF, such as if there are amendments 
to the applicable laws, protocol, a change in Principal Investigator, administrative changes, or 
following annual review by the IRB/EC. The new version of the ICF must be approved by 
the IRB/EC. Boston Scientific approval is required if changes to the revised ICF are 
requested by the center’s IRB/EC. The IRB/EC will determine the subject population to be 
re-consented.

28.  MR Scan Sequences Protocol  
This section includes the scan sequences for use in the ENABLE MRI Study for subjects in 
Phase I . 
C1734   Confidential  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 123 of 128 28.1 Background  
The MR scan sequences have been selected for their clinical relevance and their intensity as 
regards the RF and time -varying gradient fie lds the implanted system will be exposed to 
during the scan duration. The scan sequences selected are intended for utilization during a 
total of approximately 30 minutes of imaging (the total duration of time in the bore will be 
approximately one hour).  
28.2 MR Conditional Labeling 
Key aspects of the initial MR Conditional labeling being sought by Boston Scientific for the 
ImageReady System, which affect the types of scan sequences are:  
• 1.5 T, closed- bore MRI machines only  
• No anatomical scan restrictions (e.g. n o isocenter  scan  exclusion zone)  
• Scans up to Normal Operating Mode SAR limits are allowed  
The scan sequences , target anatomical locations and positions of the subjects in the scan are 
selected in order to challenge and evaluate the safety of the ImageReady  System for these 
key aspects of the MR Conditional labeling.  
28.3 Notes Regarding the MR Scan  
1. During the course of the imaging, the subject will be located in two unique positions:  
a. In order to maximize RF exposure, RF -intensive scan sequences will be run 
with the thoracic spine anatomical region centered within the bore. This will 
result in the implanted pacing system being located near the center of the 
scanner RF transmit coil, where the transmitted RF fields are strongest.  
b. In order to maximize gradient expos ure, gradient -intensive scan sequences 
will be run with the lumbar spine anatomical region centered within the bore. 
This will result in the implanted pacing system being located near the edges of 
the scanner gradient coils where gradient fields are strong est. 
2. External coils are not to be used, in order to prevent unnecessary complexity in 
moving the subject between the two locations in the bore. To maintain consistency 
across scans, the body coil in the MRI scanner is to be used for all scan sequences.  
3. All DICOM files from the scans must be saved as part of the study data.  
4. Notes for RF -intensive scan sequences  
a. A portion of the scan images obtained via the FSE sequences will be 
evaluated for the impact of image artifact near the implanted system on the 
overa ll clinical utility of the images. As such, a wide field of view (FOV) 
should be used, such as 40- 48 cm depending on subject size, in order to image 
C1734   Confidential  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 124 of 128 across the torso and include  the PG in the image. Additionally, a frequency 
matrix size of 512 pixels shoul d be used.13 
b. FSE sequences are to be T2 -weighted, which are sequences that normally 
result in a high whole body average specific absorption rate (SAR). Utilize 
scan sequence parameters that would normally be used in clinical practice. All 
sequences in the R F-intensive section must only be run at Normal Operating 
Mode. Sequence parameters may be altered in order to increase whole body 
average SAR , such as (in addition to the settings mentioned in 4a) increasing 
the turbo factor or number of slices while ensu ring the duration of the scan 
sequences is maintained, but must not exceed Normal Operating Mode SAR 
limits.  
c. If any individual sequence in the RF -intensive sequences is not available or 
cannot be run, that sequence must be abandoned and the durations of one or 
more of the other scan sequences increased such that the overall duration of 
the RF -intensive scanning is maintained.  
5. The suggested duration of all sequences are guidelines for the MR Technician 
running the scan. Variations from the suggested duration for each of the individual 
sequences are not to be considered as deviations from the protocol provided the 
overall scan durations for the RF -intensive and gradient -intensive scan regimens are 
adhered to (e.g. 11.5 minutes minimum and a maximum of 14 minut es for the RF -

The study protocol describes the method and timing of release of results on all pre -specified 
outcomes, including release of negative outcomes and that the release should be hastened if the 
study is terminated early.  
 
Access to clinical study data provides opportunities to conduct further research that may help 
advance medical sci ence and improve patient care. This helps ensure the data provided by 
research participants are used in the creation of knowledge and understanding. To this end, the 
study results  on all pre -specified outcomes, including negative outcomes, will be submitte d to 
ClinicalTrials.gov not later than one year after the study completion date, where the completion 
date is defined as the date that the final subject was examined or received an intervention for 
purposes of data collection for the primary outcome measur e. Results submission could be 
delayed if an extension is granted to the results submission deadline; however, the release of all 
results on pre -specified outcomes will be hastened if the study is terminated early. See also 
Protocol Section 25, Publication Policy.  
 
The study protocol must describe how Medicare beneficiaries may be affected by the device 
under investigation, and how the study results are or are not expected to be ge neralizable to the 
Medicare beneficiary population. Generalizability to populations eligible for Medicare due to 
age, disability, or other eligibility status must be explicitly described.  
 
Subjects for the ENABLE MRI study will be selected from the investi gators general patient 
population indicated for an Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator (ICD) or Cardiac 
Resynchronization Therapy -Defibrillator (CRT -D) device. Therefore it is not anticipated the 
device under investigation will affect Medicare beneficiaries differently than it would the 
Medicare eligible patients found in the investigators general patient population indicated for and 
receiving ICD or CRT -D implantation. With the aging of the US population, expanding 
indications for ICD implantation, and growi ng evidence favoring device -based therapy over 
antiarrhythmic drugs, data on the utilization and efficacy of ICDs in older patients is becoming 
increasingly important.1 Therefore, the results of this study are expected to be generalizable to 
the Medicare eligible population primarily due to age (E.g., 65 years or older) for beneficiaries 
with implanted cardiac devices.

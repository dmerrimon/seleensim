Title of study  
 A Pragmatic Trial Designed to Evaluate a New Critical Pathway for 
Treatment of Patients with Acute Ba cterial Skin and Skin Structure 
Infections 
Rationale Treatment of ABSSSI lacks a clear a pproach to risk stratification of 
patients and management upon patient presentation to the emergency department. Lack of a clear approach may cause unnecessary hospital admissions of ABSSSI patients, who otherwise could be  treated in an 
outpatient setting. A paucity of res earch exists regarding critical 
pathways in the ED for treatment of ABSSSI patients and the place of 
long-acting parenteral antibiotics. Critical pathways, also known as 
critical paths, clinical pathways, or care paths, are management plans 
that outline steps, such as the sequence and timing of actions, necessary for a complex process. Therefore, implementation of a new critical 
pathway may potentially demonstrate benefit compared to usual care 
for the treatment of ABSSSI for patients who could otherwise be 
treated in an outpatient healthca re setting. Long-acting parenteral 
antibiotics may be an im portant component of the pathway, as a means 
to increase efficiency of ABSSSI treatment. The new critical pathway under study is defined as (1) use of guideline-based patient identification criteria, and, for those who meet these crit eria, (2) use of 
dalbavancin, a long-acting antibiotic with an abbreviated administration schedule. 
Objectives  
  To assess the effect of a new critical pathway compared to usual care 
for the treatment of ABSSSI during in itial care (the date of enrollment 
to 14 days) and follow-up (30 days after initial care) on the following 
outcomes: 
Primary outcome 
 Hospital admission rate at initial episode of care 
Secondary outcomes   
 Total admitted hospital days dur ing initial care and follow-up  
 Infection-related total admitted hospital days during initial care 
and follow-up  
 ED length of stay at initial episode of care  
 Infection-related major surgical interventions that required 
operating room time during initial care and follow-up 
 Infection-related hospitalizations during initial care and 
follow-up  
Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 10 
Version 3.0   Infection-related hospitalizations during initial care and 
follow-up that resulted in admission to Intensive Care Unit 
(ICU) 
 All cause hospitalizations in the 30 days post discharge from 
the hospital or release from the ED 
 Infection-related ED visits during initial care and follow-up 
 Infection-related outpatient healthcare visits during initial care and follow-up 
 Use of a PICC line or central lin e to administer antibiotic 
therapy during initial care and follow-up 
 Infection-related healthcare visits due to PICC line or central 
line used to administer antibiotic  therapy during initial care and 
follow-up 
 Serious adverse events (SAEs) during initial care and follow-
up  
 Patient satisfaction with care 
 Patient work and productivity loss  
 Patient Health-related Qual ity of Life (HRQoL)  
Population  Study subjects will be recruited among patients who present to EDs of

Version 3.0  1 Introduction 
1.1 Background 
1.1.1 Skin and skin-structure infections 
Skin and skin-structure infections (SSS I) are among the most commonly encountered 
infections in clinical practice, with an es timated 14.2 million outpatient visits for cellulitis 
and abscess reported in 2005 alone.2 The number of visits to the emergency department (ED) 
for SSSI has nearly tripled between 1996 and 2005.3 In recent years,  while some evidence 
suggests that ED visits for ABSSSI in the Unite d States (US) are stab ilizing (Pallin 2014),4 
the overall burden of these inf ections to the US healthcare  system remains high—between 
2000-2012, the incidence of patients with at l east 1 SSSI-related hospita l, ambulatory care, 
and ED visit increased by 38%, 46%, and 56%, respectively.5   
There is evidence that hospital admissions for these infections have also increased 
substantially in recent years.   Based on examinations of the US National Inpatient Sample 
(NIS), Edelsberg and colleagues reported a 29%  increase in admissions to hospitals for SSSI 
between 2000 and 2004; increases were greate st among patients aged <65 years (37% vs. 
14% for those aged ≥65 years), urban hospitals  (32% vs. 11% for rura l hospitals), and among 
those with “superficial” in fections (e.g., cellulitis, ab scess) (33% vs. 24% for 
deeper/healthcare-associated infections [e.g., post-operative wound inf ection, infection due 
to vascular device]).6 The Healthcare Cost and Utilizati on Project (HCUP) 2013 report stated 
that SSSI infections were responsible fo r over 600,000 hospitalizations annually and were 
considered the eighth-most rapidly growing cause for hospitalization from 1997- 2011.7 
1.1.2 Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections 
In an effort to focus on acute infection and increase homogeneity of what had traditionally 
been a relatively diverse population, in 2013 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
provided guidance to manufacturers developing an tibiotics for a subgrou p of SSSI known as 
acute bacterial SSSI (ABSSSI). The FDA defined ABSSSI to cons ist of cellulitis /erysipelas, 
wound infection, and major cutane ous abscess. To be deemed ABSSSI, the infection should 
have a lesion surface area ≥75 squared centimeters (cm2); additional criteria set forth by the 
FDA1 were infection-specific and included: 
 Spreading areas of redness, edema, and/or induration (cellu litis/erysipelas) 
 Purulent drainage from a wound with surr ounding redness, edema, and/or induration 
(wound infection) 
 Pus within the dermis or deeper that is accompanied by redness, edema, and/or 
induration (major cutaneous abscess) 
ABSSSI are often caused by Gram-positive pa thogens, including but not limited to 
Staphylococcus aureus  (both methicillin-resistant [MRSA] and methicillin-susceptible 
strains [MSSA]) and Streptococcus pyogenes .1 
Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 17 
Version 3.0  1.1.3 Treatment of ABSSSI 
As with SSSI in general, initial treatment for ABSSSI is typically empiric and based on 
patient characteristics, clinical presenta tion, treatment guidelines, knowledge of local 
pathogen and resistance pa tterns, and the antimicr obials that are most li kely to be effective 
against them. Given the role of MRSA in this in dication, it is not surpri sing that empiric use 
of anti-MRSA therapy is fairly common; in one recent evaluation of 13,291 patients hospitalized for community- acquired complicated SSSI (i ncluding but not limited to 
ABSSSI), empiric use of anti-MRSA thera py increased from 61% during 2007 to 73% in 
2010
8 (p<0.01); Consistent with other research,9 vancomycin was the most commonly used 
agent. 
Patients requiring parenteral antibiotic treatment for ABSSSI have routinely been admitted 
to the hospital, regardless of the degree to which they may require other hospital services such as drainage or debridement.
9 In one recent examination of 619 adult patients presenting 
to 12 US EDs with SSSI, Talan et al noted that  for 85% of patients admitted to the hospital 
(n=94), their doctors indicated that the r eason for admission was the requirement for 
parenteral antibiotic therapy, and for approximately 41% of admitted patients (n=39), this was the only reason for admission.
10 The advent of outpatient pa renteral antibiotic therapy 
(OPAT), which has been shown to be a safe  and effective means by which parenteral 
antibiotic treatment can be administered,11 has provided an opportunity to rethink this 
paradigm. Current practice guidelines for the ma nagement of ABSSSI in EDs and hospitals 
have suggested that patients without a n eed for admission—defined as presence of 
hemodynamic instability, necrotizing fasciitis, and/or unstable comorbidities—do not require admission and instead could be managed as outp atients. Interestingly, these guidelines note 
that the presence of systemic signs of infect ion such as fever, in the absence of the 
aforementioned risk factors, are not cau se in and of themselves for admission.
3 Guidelines 
for the selection and management of patients receiving OPAT outline other relevant criteria, 
including psychosocial factors th at may threaten the ability to  render care on an outpatient 
basis.11 Yet, even with recommendations for outpatient  care in clinical guidelines, a lack of 
clear care pathways for ABSSSI patients in the ED limits use in practice.  The development 
of new antibiotic therapies provides the opportuni ty to successfully design and implement a 
new care pathway, due to the accelerated dos ing schedules and ease of administration 
provided by long-acting parenteral  antibiotics. Long-acting parent eral antibiotics may be an 
important component of a care pa thway in the ED for treatmen t of ABSSSI. Currently, there 
is a paucity of research that exists regarding a new clinical pathway in the ED for treatment 
of ABSSSI patients and the place of long-acting parenteral  antibiotics in therapy.  
1.1.4 Dalbavancin 
Dalbavancin (Dalvance®) is a novel, long-acti ng, second-generation li poglycopeptide that is 
indicated for the treatment of ABSSSI caused by susceptible strains of Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus  (both MRSA and MSSA), Streptococcus 
pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae , Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus 
group, and  Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible strains) .
12 In two pivotal clinical 
trials, the efficacy and safety of two doses of  IV dalbavancin administered one week apart 
(1000 milligrams (mg) for the initial infusion [750 mg for those with renal impairment] 
administered over 30 minutes, 500 mg for the second infusion [375 mg] administered over 
Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 18 
Version 3.0  30 minutes) were shown to be non-inferior to 10–14 continuous days of therapy with 
vancomycin and linezolid, respectively.12-14 A subsequent clinical tr ial demonstrated that the 
efficacy and safety of a single dose of dalbav ancin administered over a 30 minute infusion 
(1500 mg) was non-inferior to the two-dose regimen.16 Dalbavancin can be provided through 
a peripheral line, and does not ne cessitate central or PICC placement. 
1.1.5 New Critical Pathway 
Critical pathways, also known as critical paths, clinical pa thways, or care paths, are 
management plans that outline steps, such as  the sequence and timing of actions, necessary 
for a complex process. The definition of th e new critical pathway for this study was 
developed for the treatment of ABSSSI patient s who present to the ED. The new critical 
pathway is (1) use of guideline-based patient id entification criteria, a nd, for those who meet 
these criteria, (2) use of dalbavancin, a long-acting antibiotic with an abbreviated 
administration schedule. Guideline-based patien t identification criteria was developed and 
applied based on criteria for identificati on of ABSSSI and existing OPAT guidelines.3, 11 
Additional patient identification re quirements were added to sample  selection criteria in order 
to ensure identification of study subjects who likely require parenteral  antibiotic therapy.  
1.2 Purpose  
In addition to a lack of clinic al guidelines or critical pathways  to inform treatment of ABSSSI 
patients, many contributing factors are respons ible for continuing to admit ABSSSI patients 
to receive IV antibiotic therapy, who could otherwise be treated in an outpatient healthcare 
setting. First, physicians may not have experi ence with or training for use of newer IV 
antibiotics, including use of long-acting IV antibiotics. Information on use of long-acting IV antibiotics may be limited to clin ical trials, which test agents in highly selected populations 
under optimized settings with limited “real-world” generaliza bility. Second, physicians may 
have safety concerns related to adequate pa tient follow-up with the use of long-acting IV 
antibiotics. Third, there may be barriers to provision of OPAT, including institutional time 
spent coordinating care and insurance-related barriers. 
A new study is therefor e required to better understand th e “real-world” e ffectiveness of a 
new critical pathway that includes use of a long-acting antibiotic for the treatment of 
ABSSSI. In addition to tangible economic bene fits associated with reducing unnecessary 
admissions, implementation of a new critical  pathway may increase ED throughput, reduce 
utilization of healthcare services in the outpatient care setting, increase patient satisfaction, 
improve patient health-related quality of lif e (HRQoL), and reduce patient productivity 
loss/absenteeism. Study objectives 
1.3 Primary objective 
Estimate the difference in hospital admission rate at initial episode of care comparing ABSSSI patients receiving care before implemen tation of the new critical pathway and after 
implementation.

Version 3.0  2 Study design 
2.1 Overview 
This study will employ a “pre-post” pragmatic design, which will consist of both a pre-
period, or an observational ba seline period, and a post-period, or an interventional period 
(Figure 1). During the pre-period, each particip ating site will implement the first component 
of the critical pathway through implementation of  guideline-based criter ia to identify patients 
at the point of care in the ED, obtain informed  consent, and monitor enrolled subjects. Sites 
will initiate treatment for ABSSSI with “usual care,” defi ned as site- or physician-specific 
antibiotic treatment of ABSSSI  with coverage for a known or suspected Gram-positive 
infection (e.g., vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin) to each study subject who meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Blinding of treating physicia n to subject enrollment in the 
study during the pre-period will ensure unbiased provision of usual care. During the “post” 
period, for all subjects who provi de informed consent and are subsequently enrolled, each 
participating site will additio nally implement the second com ponent of the new critical 
pathway, use of dalbavancin, at the point of care in the ED to each study subject who meets 
all inclusion and ex clusion criteria.  
As the study is pragmatic in nature, selectio n criteria will be minimal and designed to 
maximize the selection of “real-world” patients who are ideal candidates for treatment in the 
outpatient healthcare se tting, but who are currently admitt ed to the hospital to receive 
treatment for ABSSSI. Site training is necessa ry for both adherence to the protocol and 
implementation of the new critical pathway, desc ribed in greater detail  in Section 7, Study 
sites and administrative structure. Briefly, the core study team  in conjunction with members 
of the contract research orga nization (CRO) will provide trai ning to other members of the 
site study team, including all participating site physicians and ot her  healthcare providers (i.e. 
nurses, pharmacists, and other staff) on protoc ol adherence and implementation of the new 
critical pathway. Protocol training will occur be fore enrolling subjects in both the pre- and 
the post-period. Before enrolling subjects in the post-period, training on implementation of 
the new critical pathway will occur over a two- to  four-week period after the date of the last 
enrolled subject in the pre-period. In additi on, ongoing reminders and orientations will be 
scheduled for sites as needed dur ing both the pre- and post-period. 
For both periods of interest, subject follow-up will begin on the day of study enrollment and end 44 days subsequently. This will reflect th e 10 to 14-day period during which antibiotics 
are anticipated to be required for care of ABSSSI plus an additional 30 days to ascertain outcomes, such as health resource utilization.  
          
Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 21 
Version 3.0  2.1.1 Study duration 
The duration of the study will not b
e predetermi ned, but rather will depend on the number of 
included sites and eligible subjects at each site . Both the pre- and pos t-periods will run until 
the minimum number of subjects are enrolled.  Refer to Section 6.3, Sample size, for 
information on the minimum number of subjects. 
2.1.2 Rationale of study design 
The design of this study allo ws for a site to unde rstand baseline treatment patterns for 
ABSSSI, then after this period, to implement an institution-level intervention (i.e., each site 
contributes study subjects to both treatment ar ms), as opposed to concurrently across sites 
(i.e., each site contributes study subjects to a si ngle arm). Use of this design removes site-
level variables as a source of  potential confounding and enab les comparisons of the new 
critical pathway to usual care in the same setting(s) and similar subject populations.  
The study is designed in a “pragmatic” fashion (i.e., minimal inclusi on/exclusion criteria, 
which will enable an examination of the im pact of the new critical pathway under “real-
world” conditions, with good generalizability/app licability to clin ical practice. 

Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 22 
Version 3.0  In order to account for temporal trends, sites will also be require d to generate data, or reports, 
on admission rates during the pre- and post-pe riod for other infections, including diabetic 
foot infections (currently part of exclusi on criteria) and pneumonia (a non-skin infection). 
This will aid in supporting a true difference in outcomes during the pre-period versus the 
post-period based on the new cr itical pathway for ABSSSI. 
2.2 Antibiotic treatment  
2.2.1 Pre-period 
During the pre-period each participating site will be required to initiate treatment for ABSSSI with “usual care,” defined as investigator’s choice of antibiotic therapy (e.g., vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin), to each study subject who meets all study selec tion criteria. It is 
expected that choice of usual care will be site  or physician specific. Dosing of each antibiotic 
agent should follow recommended guidelines, dem onstrated for antibiotic  agents in, but not 
limited to, Table 1 below. All included subj ects require Gram-positive antimicrobial 
coverage for a known or suspected infection cau sed by susceptible isolates of the following 
microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-
resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptoc occus agalactiae, Streptococcus 
dysgalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus group (including S. anginosus, S. intermedius, S. 
constellatus ) and Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin susceptible strains).   

Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 23 
Version 3.0  2.2.2 Post-period 
During the post-period, all enrolled subject s will receive treatmen t for ABSSSI with 
dalbavancin at each participating site. Dalbavan cin will be administered as a single IV dose 
of 1500 mg over 30 minutes (1125 mg over 30 minut es if CrCl <30 mL/min, for those not 
on regularly scheduled dialysis).12 Dalbavancin will be provided to sites by study sponsor.  
2.2.3 Rationale of dose/regimen of antibiotic treatment  
Usual care antibiotic therapy and dalbavanci n will each be administered per relevant 
guidelines/manufacturer instru ctions (dosing provided in Ta ble 1). Duration of treatment 

Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 24 
Version 3.0  with usual care will be left to the physicia n’s discretion, as recommendations for several 
agents include a range (e.g., 10–14 days for linezolid).24  
2.2.4 Rationale for choice of comparator 
Usual care will comprise investigator’s choice of care and may therefore vary from subject 
to subject. This was selected to allow for comparisons of the new critical pathway, which 
includes use of dalbavancin, with “real world” treatment. 
2.3 Subject identification 
Patients presenting to the ED with an ABSSSI infection during both the pre- and post-periods 
will be assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteri a. These criteria will be prepared as an 
annotated checklist for the study coordinator and/or study nu rses to implement and document 
using a CRF. Information obtained through the annotated checklist coup led with physician 
assessment will define guideline-based patient identification criteria. 
2.3.1 Pre-period 
During the pre-period, the study c oordinator and/or other study nurses will identify patients 
who may be eligible for the study. All hospital staff may be  reminded (through posters or 
memorandums) to inform the study coordinato r and/or other study nurses as soon as an 
ABSSSI patient is seen in the ED. The st udy coordinator will implement inclusion and 
exclusion criteria for the new critical pathway by patient interview and/or chart review. 
Inclusion criteria incl udes measurement of lesion size through a physician assessment 
(Appendix A), and clinical judgment that patien t requires coverage for a known or suspected 
Gram-positive infection. Patients who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria based on study coordinator assessment w ill be enrolled in the study or flagged for 
further review by core study team physicians, who will make the fi nal enrollment decision. 
The treating physician will be blinded to pr otocol content and study enrollment decision. 
Study coordinator will then complete all ad ditional elements of enrollment, including 
informed consent, and scheduling of follow-up.  
2.3.2 Post-period 
During the post-period, the study coordinator and/or other stu dy nurses will identify patients 
who may be eligible for the study. As in th e pre-period, physicians or other appropriate 
healthcare providers may also identify subject s who are eligible for the study. All hospital 
staff may be reminded (through posters or me morandums) to inform the study coordinator 
and/or other study nurses as s oon as an ABSSSI subject is seen in the ED. The study 
coordinator or treating physicia n will implement the checklist and enroll subjects into the 
study. Study coordinator will then complete enrollment, including informed consent, and scheduling of follow-up. 
2.3.3 Subject follow-up 
Within both the pre- and post-periods, follow- up for each subject will begin on the day of 
enrollment (which is anticipated to be the date  of treatment initiation) and conclude 44 days 
thereafter. Follow-up will therefore include the presumed “episode” of antibiotic therapy for 
ABSSSI (up to 14 days) and subsequent 30-day period.  
Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 25 
Version 3.0  2.3.4 Rationale for subject follow-up 
Each subject will be followed for a 14-day period (i.e. initial care), which is the longest 
supported duration of antibiotic therapy for ABSSSI treatment.15 In order to allow similar 
opportunity for collection of outcomes in th e pre- and the post-pe riod, the post-period 
similarly assumes 14 days. The addition of 30 days after initial care (i.e. follow-up) was 
thought to comprehensively assess outcome s during a relevant timeframe after the 
completion of antibiotic therapy. Therefore, 44 days (initial care and follow-up) for each subject encompasses both the maximum treat ment duration and assessment of relevant 
outcomes in the 30 days following treatment.  
2.4 Subject inclusion and exclusion criteria 
Study subjects will be recruited among patients who present to  EDs of participating sites with 
ABSSSI and who require coverage for a known  or suspected Gram- positive infection. 
Among all such individuals, attention will be fo cused on those who meet all of the inclusion 
criteria and none of th e exclusion criteria.  
2.4.1 Inclusion criteria 
Eligible study subjects satisfy all of the following inclusion criteria1,10,11,24 
 Aged ≥ 18 years 
 Present to the ED and meet clinical definition for ABSSSI10-11 
o Present with the following infection type s: cellulitis/erysipe las, wound infection, 
or major cutaneous abscess 
o Lesion size area requirements, as meas ured manually by the length multiplied by 
perpendicular width of wound (Appendix A). 
 Lesion size area ≥75 cm2 
 Known or suspected infecti on caused by susceptible isolat es of the following Gram-
positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin -susceptible and 
methicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, 
Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus group (including S. anginosus, S. 
intermedius, S. constellatus) and Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin susceptible strains).  
 Willing and able to return to the hospital or a designated clinic for scheduled visits, or be 
in contact with the study coordinator th rough telephone communication, as required by 
the protocol and the antibiot ic treatment administered 
2.4.2 Exclusion criteria 
Study subjects with any of the fo llowing criteria will be excluded1,12-14, 26-28,29 
  
 
 

Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 26 
Version 3.0   Known or suspected Gram-negative infections including bacteremia, anaerobic infections, or 
fungemia, even in the presence of Gram-positive infection     
 Known or suspected infections that are severe, life-threateni ng, or are not included in the 
ABSSSI FDA guidance, includ ing the following examples: 
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 

Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 27 
Version 3.0   Injection drug users presenting with a fever 
  
 
 
 Severe neurological dis
order leading to severe immobility or confined to wheelchair or 
bed (e.g. paraplegia and hemiplegia) 
 Bilateral lower extrem ity involvement of the suspected infection (to exclude patients 
with chronic venous stasis) 
 Unwilling or unable to follow study procedures 
2.5 Early study termination 
A premature discontinuation will occur when a subject who signed the informed consent 
form (ICF) ceases participation in the st udy, regardless of circumstances, before the 
completion of all study assessments (i.e., before completing all protocol-stipulated 
activities). Subjects can be prematurely discontinued from therapy after careful 
consideration for any one of  the following reasons: 
 
 Screen failure  
 Failure to receive complete critical path way by not receiving dalbavancin in the post-
period 
 Withdrawal of consent (a clear reason will be documented) 
 AE (before or after administration of  first dose of antibiotic therapy) 
 Protocol deviation/viol ation, including lack of  protocol compliance 
 Lost to follow-up (every effort will be made to contact the subject) 
 Study or site prematurely terminat ed by the sponsor for any reason 
 If a Gram-negative  infection including bacteremia, an anaerobic infection, or fungemia 
develops during the study, or is  subsequently found to have been present at baseline, the 
subject should be removed from study treatmen t and receive appropriate antibiotic(s) to 
treat the Gram-negative infection, anaerobic infection, or fungemia.  
 Other reasons, such as specified administrative reasons or pregnancy 
All subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study, regardless of cause, 
should have a final assessment at early te rmination (ET). A final assessment will be 
                                                 
a If the patient is a woman of child-bearing potential, from at least the first dose of study drug until the final visit she 
must confirm strict abstinence from sexual intercourse with any male or must confirm use of an effective contraceptive 
method from the following list: A barrier (condoms, diaphragm or cervical cap) with spermicide; Oral or similar 
contraceptive, which includes, bu t is not limited to: injectable, implanted, or patch hormone therapy, and intrauterine 
device (IUD); Documented surgical sterili zation at least 4 weeks prior to baseline;  Partner vasectomy at least 6 months 
prior to baseline.  
Within these limits, the specific form of contraception employ ed are left to the discretio n of the patient, and/or the 
principal investigator, and/or the patient’s physician. 

Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 28 
Version 3.0  defined as either a physical visit or a te lephone call that completes the evaluations 
scheduled for the Final Visit at  the end of study (Day 44 visi t; refer to Section 4.2, Data 
collection), or an earlier vi sit, depending on the visit schedule and when ET occurs. 
Subjects who do not complete all scheduled visi ts/procedures will be requested to have an 
ET Visit. A clear description will be docum ented and source documentation will be kept by 
the investigator. The reasons for premature di scontinuation from the study will be reflected 
on the Study Termination page of the CRF.

Version 3.0  3.2 Data collection 
Information on baseline characteristics, outcomes, and other measures will be collected 
following subject enrollment in  the study and will be based on  the medical record and CRFs 
that will be developed exclus ively for use in this study.  
Data collection will involve the use of the CRO’s electronic data capture (EDC) system through use of CRFs, to which only authorized pe rsonnel will have access.  Subject’s data are 
to be entered into the EDC system by the inve stigator or designee using their assigned EDC 
user account. After data entry into the EDC system by the investigator or designee, a 
combination of manual and programmatic edit ch ecks will be used to review the data for 
completeness, logic, and adherence to study protocol. As a result of these edits checks, data monitoring, and reviews, queries may be electr onically issued to the site and should be 
answered electronically  via the EDC system. 

Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 35 
Version 3.0  3.2.1 Data collection schedule 
Table 5 describes expected follow-up. Follow-up visits will be scheduled for 24 hours after 
enrollment (post-period only), between 48-72 hours after enrollment (post-period only), 14 
days after enrollment (both periods), and 44 da ys after enrollment (both periods). The follow-
up visits during the post-period include a telephone call at 24 hours and a limited physical 
visit at 48-72 hours. However, for subjects unabl e to be seen back at the site, a telephone 
interview will suffice at 48-72 hour s. Research data will be co llected through follow-up visits 
at 14 days (telephone call can o ccur between 14 and 21 days from  enrollment) and at 44 days 
(telephone call can o ccur between 44 and 51 days from  enrollment), through a telephone 
interview of the subject in both the pre- and post-periods. Additionally, electronic medical 
chart data will be reviewed at the 14 day and 44 day time points from enrollment. Any 
additional visits to the visit schedule below will be at the discretion of the subject and treating physician.  

Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 36 
Version 3.0  3.2.2 Patient Diary Aid 
Patients will be provided with a bound, paper diar y to record specific information about their 
health status on days in which they have an inte raction with a health ca re provider.  The diary 
is intended only as an aid to help patients remember details about health care appointments, 
medications, and medical tests. Th e diary will not be collected by or returned to study staff.   
4 Safety assessments 
At each visit, subjects are to be queried regarding any adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse 
events (SAEs) that have occurred since the pr evious visit. Subjects will be asked to volunteer 
information with a nonleading question such as , “How do you feel sin ce your last visit?” 
Study site personnel will record all pertinent information in the subject’s CRF. All AEs will 
be recorded on the appropriate AE reporting page of the subjec t’s CRF whether or not they 
are considered causally relate d to the study drug (any antibi otic given for ABSSSI from 
enrollment, including the pre-period). 
For every AE, the investigator will: 
 Provide an assessment of the seriousness of the event (i.e., is it an SAE?), as well as 
the severity and causal relationship 
 Document all actions taken w ith regard to the study drug 
 Detail any other treatment measures taken for the AE 
 Document the outcome of the AE 
In addition, subjects will be reminded, as descri bed in the ICF to notify site personnel of any 
AEs occurring from the time the subject signed the ICF until the final follow-up visit. Any 
AEs that are ongoing at the time of the final protocol-defined study visit will be followed 
until the condition returns to pre-study status, has resolved or stabilized, or can be explained as being unrelated to the study drug. If a follow-up visit is d eemed necessary for appropriate 
safety surveillance, it will take place within 30  days of the final protoc ol-defined study visit. 
4.1 Adverse events 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a pa tient or clinical tria l subject administered 
a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal re lationship with this 
treatment. 

Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 37 
Version 3.0  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (i ncluding an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of 
a product, whether or not considered related to the product. The definition of an AE includes: 
 Worsening of a pre-existing condition or underlying disease  
 Events associated with the discontinuation of the use of a product(s), (e.g., appearance 
of new symptoms) 
Please note hospital admissions and/or medica l/surgical procedures scheduled prior to 
consenting, but occurring during the study will not be captured as AEs, but will be listed in 
the medical history if related to a pre-existing condition. AEs or abnormal test findings will 
be followed until the event (or it s sequelae) or the abnormal test  finding resolves or stabilizes 
at a level acceptable to the sponsor/investigator. 
4.2 Causality assessment 
For each AE, the investigator will provide an assessment of causal relationship to the study 
drug. The causality assessment will be recorded  on the appropriate AE reporting page of 
the subject’s CRF. Causal relationship will be assessed by answering the following 
question: 
Is there a reasonable possibility the study drug caused the event? 
Yes: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and 
adverse event; i.e.:  
 There is a reasonable temporal relations hip between the study drug and the event, 
and/or  
 The event is unlikely to be attributed to underlying/concurrent disease, other study 
drugs, or other factors, and/or 
 Positive dechallenge and/or rechallenge exist 
 
No: There is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug 
and adverse event, i.e.: 
 There is no reasonable temporal relationshi p between the study drug and the event, 
or 
 The subject did not take the study drug, or 
 The event is likely to be attributed to  underlying/concurrent disease, other study 
drugs, or other factors, or 
 The event is commonly occurr ing in the (study) populati on independent of study drug 
exposure 
4.3 Severity assessment 
The investigator will provide an assessment of th e severity of each AE by recording a severity 
rating on the appropriate AE repor ting page of the subject’s CRF. Severity,  which is a 
description of the intensity  of manifestation of the AE, is distinct from seriousness,  which 
Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 38 
Version 3.0  implies a subject outcome or AE-re quired treatment measure associat ed with a threat to life or 
functionality. Severity will be asse ssed according to the following scale: 
Mild: Minor awareness of signs or symptoms that are easily tolerated without specific 
medical intervention  
Moderate: Discomfort that interferes with us ual activities and may require minimal 
intervention 
Severe: Significant signs or symptoms that are inca pacitating with an in ability to work or 
perform routine activities and/or that require medical intervention 
4.4 Serious adverse events 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening (i.e., th e subject was, in the opinion of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if more severe)  
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of exis ting hospitalization 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Is an important medical event that might not be immediately life threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization but might je opardize the subject or might require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed  above. Examples of such 
events are intensive treatment in an em ergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization 
or development of dependency or abuse. 
In general, hospitalization signifies that the pa rticipant has been detained (usually involving 
at least an overnight stay) at the hospital fo r observation and/or trea tment that would not 
have been appropriate in the physic ian’s office or outpatient setting.  
Emergency room visits that do not  result in hospitalization should be evaluated for one of the 
other serious outcomes to determin e whether they qualify as SAEs. 
4.5 Medication error 
Medication error refers to any unintended erro r in the dosing and/or administration of the 
study drug as per instructions in the prescrib ing information.  Medication errors generally 
fall into 4 categories as follows: 
 Wrong drug 
 Wrong dose (including dosing regimen, stre ngth, form, concentration, amount); 
 Wrong route of administration; 
Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 39 
Version 3.0   Wrong subject (i.e. not administer ed to the intended subject). 
Medication Errors include occurrences of  overdose and underdose of the study drug. 
4.6 Procedure for collection of adverse ev ents and serious adverse events   
All nonserious AEs and SAEs that  occur in a subject from the time he or she signs the ICF 
until the final follow-up visit will be assessed and recorded on the source documents and 
CRF, regardless of causal rela tionship to the study drug. 
4.7 Procedure for serious ad verse event reporting  
All SAEs that occur in a subject from the time he or she signs the ICF until the final follow-up visit will be reported to th e sponsor within 24 hours of aw areness of the event using the 
provided SAE Report Form. The completed SAE Re port Form will be sent directly to the 
sponsor by emailing . In addition to completing the SAE 
Report Form, each SAE will be entered on the appr opriate page of the CRF. The investigator 
will assess the causality for each SAE. 
When death occurs with an SAE, the cause of death will be reported as an SAE. “Fatal” will 
be reported as the outcome for these events. 
The sponsor will contact the investigator, if nece ssary, to clarify any of the event information. 
The investigator will provide any follow-up in formation for the event to the sponsor on an 
updated SAE report form as soon as it becomes available. If the investigator is notified of a SAE that o ccurs post-study period, that he or she wishes to 
report to the sponsor (e.g., an event suspected to be causally related to the study drug), the 
event will be reported through the process described above.  
Where appropriate, if required by local regula tions or procedures, the in vestigator will report 
these events to the Institutional Review Bo ard (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) and/or national 
regulatory authority in addition to the sponsor. 
4.8 Procedure for medication error reporting  
Medication errors with or without an associated  AE will be recorded as medication errors in 
the CRF. SAEs associated with medication er rors will be reported to the sponsor as 
described in Section 5.7. 
4.9 Procedures for reporting preg nancies/lactation exposure  
Occurrences of pregnancy/lactat ion exposure in a subject should be reported within 24 hours. 
In cases where a pregnancy/lactation exposure occurs with a SAE, the SAE report form 
should be used to report the SAE and the Pre gnancy Reporting form should be used to report 
the pregnancy.  
When a pregnancy occurs without any concu rrent SAE, the Pregnancy Reporting form will 
be submitted alone. The pregnancy will be followed through to outcome of pregnancy, 
including spontaneous or volunta ry termination, details of the birth, and the presence or 
absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn 

Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 40 
Version 3.0  complications. Any pregnancy discovered from the time of consent to follow-up will be 
reported.  
4.10 Potential Hy’s Law cases  
Every subject that meets poten tial Hy’s law criteria,  
• ALT or AST >/=3xULN AND  
• Total Bilirubin >/=2xULN AND  • Alkaline Phosphatase <2xULN occurring anytime from the time he or she signs the ICF for the trial until the final follow 
up visit, investigators will notif y the sponsor immediately when all the above criteria have 
been met. A potential Hy’s law case will be se nt directly to the sponsor by emailing IR-
clinical-SAE@allergan.com on an  AE of Special Interest Fo rm along with the SAE Report 
Form as soon as possible (within 24 hours of learning of the potential Hy’s law). The CRF 
for potential Hy’s law cases will be completed within seven calendar days. Every effort to determine the cause of the liv er enzyme abnormalities will be  made, and close monitoring 
will be initiated in conjunction with the medical monitor and in accordance with the FDA “Guidance for Industry: Drug Induced Liver In jury- Pre-Marketing Cl inical Evaluation” 
July 2009. 
5 Data analysis 
Frequency and proportion of subjects deemed eligible and ineligible for study enrollment based on each of the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be summarized. The frequency and proportion of subjects who successfully comple te the study, withdraw, were lost-to-follow-
up, and who terminated the study early, will also be reporte d. Subject characteristics at 
baseline will be summarized and described for all enrolled subjects and compared between 
the pre- and post-periods. Site characteristics will also be described. Descriptive statistics (count, mean, standard deviation, range for quantit ative variables, and counts and percentages 
for categorical variables) will be reported fo r all outcomes. The difference in study outcomes 
between the pre- and post-period will be as sessed using appropriate  statistical methods, 
accounting for study site, with adequate power . The primary outcome will be tested for 
simple superiority, and subseque ntly, tested for non-inferiority with a 10% margin between 
the pre- and post-periods. 
All analyses will be specified in a detailed statis tical analysis plan (SAP) that will be prepared 
subsequently and before database lock. Th e SAP will include table and figure shells.  
5.1 Cost 
Cost data will not be collected  in the study. As thes e data often vary by site and insurer, 
representative unit cost estimates for each h ealthcare service/medication identified during the 
collection of outcome measures will be identi fied. Total costs of care for each study subject 
will then be estimated by multiply ing utilization of healthcare se rvices collected via the CRF 
by the corresponding unit costs; mean/median total costs of care during the pre- and post-
periods will then be estimated and compared. The approach to the pre-post comparison and 
unit costs will be defined in the SAP. 
Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 41 
Version 3.0  5.2 Handling of missing data  
The SAP will define how missing values and info rmation from subjects lost to follow-up will 
be handled. Site procedures will be devel oped to minimize the amount of missing data 
however, as this is a pragmatic trial, missing data is expected. Certain outcomes are based on 
data availability from sites (e.g. laboratory values will be summarized for subjects who had data collected). 
The extent of missing values will be examined  to assess completeness of data among the 
study cohort. In addition, the characteristics of part icipants with and without missing data 
will be examined to assess whether participant characteristics have any relationship to 
incompleteness.  
5.3 Sample size and sample size considerations 
 Hospital admission rate, which is correlated to  total hospital time for the study population, 
was largely unknown for purposes of sample size estimation. The final enrollment to support hypothesis testing for a primary outcome of total admitted hospital days was initially calculated as 322 s ubjects (161 subjects in each period). The sample size was 
evaluated after a planned interi m analysis of pre-period data once 75 subjects were enrolled 
in the pre-period. Based on results of the interi m analysis, an adjustment was made at the 
time of the analysis to revise the primary outcome from total admitted hospital days to hospital admission rate at initial episode of care. The initially estimated final enrollment of 
322 subjects, including adjustments for at trition, would support one-sided hypothesis 
testing (two-sample Pearson chi-square te st for proportion difference with equal group 
weights using a normal approximation) with a significance level of 0.05 and at least 80% 
power assuming hospital admission rate comp aring the pre- and post-periods were 38% 
versus 23%. 
   
5.4 Data monitoring and quality control 
Before any subject enters the study, a representa tive of the sponsor or CRO will meet with 
the investigator and core study team to review the procedur es to be followed during the 
study. Electronic data capture (EDC) functionality training will be provided via computer 
to investigators and authorized designees on recording the data in the CRFs using the EDC 
system. All subject information and data will be considered private health information and 
kept confidential in compliance with HI PAA (Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996). After the first subj ect is enrolled, the CRO representative will 
periodically monitor the pr ogress of the study by conducti ng on-site visits. The CRO 
representative will review query statuses remotely, possibly warranting more frequent communication and/or site visits with the investigator and the study site staff. The 
investigator will make available to the CRO representative source documents (written notes 
and electronic medical records,  if used), signed consent form s, and all other study-related 
Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 42 
Version 3.0  documents. The investigator and the study site staff will be responsible for data entry of 
subject data into the CRFs via the EDC system , resolving data queries generated via the 
EDC system and providing missing or corr ected data. The investigator or CRO 
representative will be responsible for approving all data entry and a ll changes performed on 
the data, and endorsing the subjec t data within the EDC system. 
Quality control will be implemented and maintained throughout the conduct of the study.  
Data collection will involve the use of the EDC system provided by the CRO, to which only authorized personnel will have access. S ubject’s data will be entered into the EDC 
system by the investigator or designee using their assigned EDC user account as specified 
in Section 4.2 Data collection.  
6 Study sites and study administrative structure 
 
This study will be performed at approxima tely 8 study centers in North America. 
6.1 Core study team 
The core study team for each site will consist of primary investigators, CRO representatives, 
and sponsor representatives. The core study team will be responsible for training of the site study teams, responsible for adherence to the protocol, monitoring and reporting as consistent with regulation and law, and coordinating and pa rticipating in training sessions for the site 
study teams. The core study team is responsible for coordinating training of the site study 
teams for both protocol adherence and impl ementation and operationalization of the new 
critical pathway, including site-specific co nsiderations. Training will occur before 
enrollment in the pre- and post-periods fo r adherence to the protocol. Training will 
additionally occur for implementation of the ne w critical pathway during the 2-4 weeks after 
the last subject is enrolled dur ing the pre-peri od of the study. 
6.2 Site study team 
The site study team at each site will consist of the primary site investigators and study administrators, including hosp ital staff (including physicians , nurses, and/or pharmacists), 
who will be responsible for adhe ring to the protocol for both  the pre- and post-periods. The 
site study team will be further supported by th e core study team, specifically, the CRO. The 
site study team will be responsible for particip ating in training sessions and/or engagement 
in communication from the core study team, in  regards to study bac kground/rationale, site 
procedures to identify and enroll subjects w ho are eligible for the study during the pre- and 
post-periods, data collection, and follow-up of  subjects. Specifically, for the post-period, 
training on the implementation of the new critical pathway is vital. Training will include site procedures, such as how to obtain study dr ug during the post-period from the hospital 
pharmacy and the location to administer study  drug. This will ensu re adherence to the 
protocol and that operationalization of the study is consistent dur ing both study periods. 
Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 43 
Version 3.0  7 Ethical considerations  
7.1 Regulatory and ethical compliance and protectio n of human subjects 
To ensure safety of participating subjects, this study will be conducted in compliance with 
the protocol, the rules and regulations of each  institutional review board (IRB), informed 
consent regulations, and standard operating procedures (SOP) at CRO, sponsor, and each 
study site. This study will adhere to all applicable local regulatory requirements and be 
governed according to local laws and regulati ons. The following rules, regulations, and 
practices will be adhered to: Good Clinical  Practice (GCP) guidelines, International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines, Declaration of Helsi nki, and the Belmont 
Report. 
7.2 Subject confidentiality 
All necessary measures will take place to ensure  subject confidentiality. Only site study team 
members and an independent unit of the CRO will  know the identity of participating subjects, 
however no identifying inform ation will be collected on any study-related documents. 
Contact information for the subjec t after their consent will be se nt to an independent unit of 
the CRO, where it will be kept c onfidential, and will only be us ed to contact the patient for 
pre-determined study visits. Any data provided to CRO or spons or will be de-identified by 
using the unique subject ID. Neither CRO nor  sponsor will have access to any subject 
identification log. Any data reported or publishe d will be presented as aggregated data, and 
no individual data will be reported to re duce any risk of subject identification. 
7.3 Informed consent procedures 
 
Patients, after being given an explanation of  the study, will give voluntary and written 
informed consent and HIPAA (Health Insura nce Portability and Accountability Act of 
1996) authorization (in compliance with 21 CFR, Parts 50 and 312) or other appropriate documentation, according to local regulatory re quirements, before participating in any 
study-related procedures. 
Informed consent will be obtained from each subject prior to the beginning of any study-
specific activities, and will include consent to collection of clinical, economic and humanistic 
outcomes. This may involve gathering data through chart review or  directly eliciting 
information from subjects. Informed consent during the post-period, or  interventional period, 
will involve consent to treatment through a new critical pathway. Each eligible subject will 
have the opportunity to read and review the approved informed consent form (ICF) and have 
the opportunity to ask questions  to the participating Study In vestigator, Study Coordinator, 
or other study team member. Signed copies of the ICF and the HIPAA or other locally 
applicable form will be given to the subjec t, and both documents will be placed in the 
investigator’s study files. 
The participating subject may w ithdraw participation and/or informed consent at any time 
throughout the conduct of the study.  Withdrawing participation or  consent will relieve the 
subject from any future da ta collection time points.  
Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 44 
Version 3.0  7.4 Responsibilities of the investigator and IRB 
The responsibilities of investigat ors include creation of and main tenance of a core study team 
(Please refer to Section 7 for more informati on), adhering to protocol requirements, including 
educational requirements for implementation of  the intervention in the post-period, and 
ultimately, are the institutional leads to support protocol implementation. The study team will 
be responsible for timely reporting, where appropriate, to the institutional IRB. The 
investigators must demonstrate reasonable efforts to obtain qualified patients for the study. 
The responsibilities of the IRB in clude adhering to institutional requirements,  performing an 
objective review of the accep tability of the study protocol and analysis plan (i.e. research) in 
terms of institutional requirements, commitments, regulations, applicable law, and 
professional conduct and practice,  provide continued monitori ng and review of research, 
review of key events (proto col amendments, protocol deviations, adverse events, or non-
compliance), review of any requ ired progress reports, and to report any required information 
to appropriate authoritie s and/or organizations.  
7.5 Publication  
All data generated in this study are the propert y of the sponsor. An integrated clinical and 
statistical analysis report will be prep ared at the completion of the study.  
Publication of the results by the investigator wi ll be subject to mutual agreement between the 
investigator and the sponsor and will follow the sponsor’s SOP on publications. 
8 Protocol deviations and violations 
A protocol deviation  is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or 
procedures that is under the investigator’s responsibility and oversight (as defined by 
regulations) without prior written IRB approva l or favorable opinion of an appropriate 
amendment and that does not have a major impa ct on the subject’s rights, safety, or well- 
being, or on the integrity and au thenticity of the study data. Deviations may include, but are 
not limited to, departure from inclusion/exclus ion criteria, dosing, duration of treatment, 
failure to perform the required assessments at specified time points, sc heduling of visits not 
in accordance with specifications, or subject sa fety. Deviating from the protocol is permitted 
only if absolutely necessary for the safety or clinical management of the subjects and will immediately be reported to the sponsor. Protoc ol deviations will be re ported to the sponsor 
either verbally or electronically within 5 working days from the day of discovery. 
A protocol violation  is a form of protocol deviation that has a major impact on the subject’s 
rights, safety, or well-being, or  on the integrity and authentic ity of the study data. Protocol 
violations will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours, if possible. The IRB will be 
notified within the time period dictated by the IRB associated with this study. 
8.1 Protocol amendments 
Any amendment to this protocol will be prov ided to the investigator in writing by the 
sponsor. No protocol amendment will be implemented (with the exceptions noted below) 
before it has been approved by the IRB and th e signature page, signed by the investigator, 
has been received by the sponsor. If the protocol  is amended to eliminate or reduce the risk 
Allergan Protocol: CMO-US-ID-0476  Page 45 
Version 3.0  to subjects, the amendment will be implem ented before IRB review and approval. 
However, the IRB will be informed in writing of such an amendment, and approval will be 
obtained within reasonable time limits.

10.1 Measurement of lesion characteristics 
 
Measurements are to be taken while the infected area is in a nondependent position, e.g., if infection 
was on the leg, the subject was lying down, not sitting or standing. All types of infections are to be 
measured as measurement of erythema upon enrollment and any subsequent physical follow-up visits. 
Maximal dimensions of erythema, both width and length, are to be recorded in centimeters. Investigators should attempt to find the infection edge that best distinguished erythema from non-
erythematous skin. Erythema is to be measured in the dimension of maximal length. The maximal 
width is to be measured perpendicular to the axis of the maximal length. The maximal width 
measurement does not have to be in the center if the area of erythema is irregular. The length of the 
infection is to be multiplied by perpendicular width of wound.

There is some evidence that there is a decrease in leucocyte levels, with a nadir eight  8 weeks 
after implantation.  This has been evident in both first line and refractory studies. with studies 
reporting a The median number of leukocytes w as of 3.55 x 109/ L (3.55 x 103/µL) (NCIC CTC3 
gGrade 1).  Leukocyte levels recover from this point, with the median value rising to normal 
levels 4-8 weeks after the decline.

Metastases  
SCRI  Innovations 
Study  Number : GI 189  
Sponsor:  SCRI Devel opment Innovations , LLC  
Study  Duration:  The total duration of the study  is planned to be  16 months.  Phase of Study :  II 
Study  Center s: This study  will be  conducted at approximately 5 sites in the United States in the SCRI  
network.    
Number of 
Patients:  Up to  50 patients are planned to be enrolled in this study.  
Objectives:  Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is:  
 To evaluate the safety of two treatment cohorts combining regorafenib and SIR-
Spheres microspheres (SIR -Spheres) radioemobliz ation  in patients with refractory  
metastatic colorectal cancer  (mCRC ) with liver metastasis.  
Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objective of this study is:  
 To evaluate the overall response rate ( ORR), progression -free survival ( PFS), and  
overall survival ( OS) of patients with refractory mCRC when treated with 
combination SIR-Spheres  and regorafenib in the two sequencing cohorts  
Exploratory Objectives  
The exploratory objective of this study is:  
 To evaluate the status of exploratory biomarkers and correlate w ith clinical 
outcomes of patients treated in one of two  SIR-Spheres  and regorafenib cohorts.  
 
Study  Design : This is an open -label study comparing the safety of two treatment cohorts in which 
radioembolization  will be administered using the device  SIR-Sphe res microspheres (90Y 
resin microspheres) in combination with regorafenib to patients with mCRC with liver 
metastases.  The two treatment cohorts will be evaluated  for safety, ORR, PFS, and OS.  
Twenty -five patients will be treated in each cohort.  The fir st cohort will complete 
enrollment before the second cohort opens.  There will be no randomization or blinding.  
Blood samples will be collected from all patients prior to the hepatic angiogram and 99mTc 
MAA lung shunt scan , on Day 8 after SIR -Spheres trea tment , and Day 30 (pre -dose) after 
SIR-Spheres treatment  (see Section 5.1) .  Expressions of cytokines and proteins will be 
measured to explore potential biomarkers that may correlate with clinical outcome.  
Study Drugs, 
Doses, and Modes 
of Administration:  Two treatment cohorts will be evaluated sequentially as follows:     
Cohort 1  Regorafenib (one cycle) followed by SIR -Spheres followed by re -initiation 
of regorafenib 2-4 weeks after SIR -Spheres  
Cohort 2  SIR-Spheres followed by regorafenib to start 2 -4 wee ks after SIR -Spheres  
All patients will take regorafenib, orally once -a-day, on Days 1 -21 of a 28 -
day treatment cycle.  Twenty -five patients will be treated in each cohort.

Exclusion 
Criteria:  
(continued)  14. Inadequately controlled hypertension (i.e., systolic blood pressure [SBP] >18 0 
mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >100 mmHg) (patients with values 
above these levels must have their blood pressure (BP) controlled with medication 
prior to starting treatment).  
15. Serious active infection at the time of treatment, or another serious underlying 
medical condition that would impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol 
treatment.  
16. Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C.  
17. Presence of other active cancers, or history of treatment for invasive ca ncer ≤5 
years.  Patients with Stage I cancer who have received definitive local treatment 
and are considered unlikely to recur are eligible.  All patients with previously 
treated in situ carcinoma (i.e., non -invasive) are eligible, as are patients with 
history of non -melanoma skin cancer.  
18. Use of strong CYP34A inducers or inhibitors ( see Appendix G). 
19. The herbal medications St. John’s wort, kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko biloba,

medications 7  days prior to first dose of study drug.  
20. Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit 
compliance with the protocol.  
21. Inability or un willingness to comply with study and/or follow -up procedures 
outlined in the protocol.  
Correlative 
Testing:  
 
 Blood samples will be collected from all patients prior to the hepatic angiogram and 99mTc 
MAA lung shunt scan , on Day 8 after SIR -Spheres treatm ent, and Day 30 (pre -dose) after 
SIR-Spheres treatment  (see Section 7.2) .  Expressions of cytokines and proteins will be 
measured to explore potential biomarkers that may correlate with clinical outcome.  
Cytokine analyses will include , but not be limited t o, the following:  VEGFA, VEGFC, 
VEGFD, FGF2, HGF, EGF, PDGF -AA, PDGF -AB/BB, MMP -9, sVEGFR -2, E-selectin, 
VCAM -1, ICAM -1, MIF, TNFα, IFN -α and -γ, LIF, TGF -α, TGF -β1, Angiopoietin -2, 
Endoglin, IGF, Osteopontin, GM -CSF, G -CSF, M -CSF, SCGF -β, SCF, Beta -NGF, PlGF, 
MCP -1, MCP -3, RANTES, MIP -1α, MIP -1β, MIG, Eotaxin, IP -10, SDF -1α, GRO -α, 
CTACK, IL -1β, IL -2, IL -3, IL -4, IL -5, IL -6, IL -7, IL -8, IL -9, IL -10, IL -12 p40, IL -12 p70, 
IL-16, CA9 and HIF -1 alpha .  
 
Protein expression in blood samples will be measured by  proteomics platform . 
Statistical 
Methodology:  There is no formal hypothesis testing in this study. The sample size of 50 patients (25 in 
each cohort) is based on clinical practicalities rather than statistical reasoning , in order to 
evaluate the safety o f the 2 different sequences in treatment administration of SIR -Spheres 
microspheres and regorafenib . With 25 patients  per cohort , the 95% confidence interval for 
the response rate estimate would be no more than 21%.

1. INTRODUC TION 
The American Cancer Society estimates that 142,820 new cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) will 
be diagnosed in the United States in 2013.  Although new treatments and frequent screening s 
ha
ve decreased mortality rates over the past 30 years, it is estimated that 50,830 patients will 
succ
umb to the disease in 2013.  Colorectal cancer remains the third most frequently diagnosed 
c
ancer in the United States and is responsible for 9% of all cancer deaths (American Cancer 
S
ociety 2013 ).  
The population of patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in the U.S. is 
around 25,000 patients.  Once patients have exhausted available standard therapies, their average 
survival is 4-6 months, and many have a performance status of Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Gr
oup (ECOG) 1.  Findings from previous Phase III trials of p anitumumab  versus best 
supportive care ( BSC ) and cetuximab  versus BSC, in  patients with refractory mC RC suggested a 
media
n progression -fre e survival  (PFS)  of two months and overall survival (O S) of 
approximately 5 months  (Va n Cutsem et al. 2007 , Jonker et al. 2007 ).  Recently, regorafenib 
([
Stivarga] Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) was approved for the treatment of patients 
with 
mCRC.  This was based on an improvement in OS of 6.4 versus 5.0 months (HR 0.77).  The 
P
FS of patients on re gorafenib  was 1.9 months v ersus 1.7 months for placebo ( Grothey et al. 
2012).  Antiangiogenic drugs like regorafenib have been thought to act primarily as tumor-static 
a
gents by preventing the growth of new tumor blood vessels.  Other antiangiogenic agents such 
as bevacizumab have been and are being evaluated in the maintenance setting during first line 
therapy for mCRC.   
1.1 Background 
Recent targeted therapies and treatment strategies have shown promise in CRC but elimination 
of
 disease once spread to the liver remains a challenge.  The main cause of death in over 50% of 
CRC
 patients is liver metastases ( Silverberg 1977 ).  Preoperative chemotherapy may improve 
resectability but may also impact overall survival.  Postoperative complications have been 
a
ssociated with decreased long-term survival after surgery for CRC with liver metastases with 
curative intent ( Mavros et al. 2013 ).  
R
adioembolization also referred to as selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) enables 
multiple hepatic metastases to be targeted in a single procedure ( H endlisz et al. 2010 ).  Through 
fluoroscopic guidance, radioembolization can be achieved with the insertion of an intra-vascular 
catheter in the groin threaded through the arteries until it reaches the hepatic artery.  Yttrium- 90 
(90Y)
 microspheres are released through the catheter to lodge in the small vessels that feed the 
tumor, stopping blood flow and emitting radiation.  Radioembolization aims to deliver target 
ra
diation to all tumors in the liver while limiting the dose to the liver parenchyma ( Kennedy et al. 
2012).  
S
IR-Spheres® microspheres (90Y-resin microspheres) are approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), and a number of safety and efficacy studies have been conducted in 
patients with mCRC with liver metastases.

Page 25 of 98 A randomized study of 46 mCRC patients with liver metastases revealed that a single hepatic 
a
rterial injection of 90Y-resin microspheres combined with intravenous (IV) infusion 
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) improved time to overall disease progression.  Forty-four eligible patients 
were randomized to Arm A (n = 23) IV infusion 5-FU 300 mg/m2 on days 1-14 every 3 weeks ; 
or
 Arm B (n = 21) radioembolization plus IV infusion 5-FU 225 mg/m2 on days 1 through 14 
then 300 mg
/m2 days 1-14 every 3 weeks.  Treatment continued until hepatic progression and 
c
ross-over to radioembolization was permitted for patients in Arm A.  Ten patients in Arm A 
c
rossed-over at progression.  Median OS was 7.3 and 10.0 months in arms A and B, respectively 
(Hendli
sz et al. 2010 ).  
1.2 Rat ionale for the Study 
Radioembolization  using S IR-Spheres microspheres  (SIR -S pheres) to treat liver -only or liver -
dominant mCRC  has been success ful in t his refractory setting.  The combination of regorafenib  
and SIR -S pheres is an attractive option as an anti -tumor and maintenance treatment for the 
refractory CRC population.  
The proper sequencing of this combination of regorafenib and SIR-Spheres is currently unclear.  
We propose this two arm study (25 patients in each arm) to evaluate the safety of the 
combination of regorafenib  and SIR -S pheres , with one cohort of patients receiving regorafenib 
for three weeks followed by a one week hold of regoraf enib (regorafenib half -life is 28 hours, 
one week to allow for washout), followed by SIR -Spheres treatment, followed by re -initiation of 
regorafenib two to four weeks later , and the other cohort of patients receiving SIR -Spheres 
followed by the initiation of regorafenib  two to four weeks later .

5. STUDY DESIGN 
This i
s an open-label study comparing the safety of two treatment cohorts in which 
radioembolization  will be administered usin g the device  SIR-S phere s in combination with 
regorafenib  to patients with mCRC with liver metastases.  The two treatment cohorts will be 
e
valuated for safety, ORR, PFS, and OS.  Twenty -five patients will be treated in each cohort.  
The first cohort will complete enro llment befor e the second cohort opens.  There will be no 
randomization or blinding.  
A safety review for toxicity by the Medical Monitor will occur after the first 10 patients have 
be
en enrolled in each cohort and treated with one cycle of regorafenib and SIR-spheres 
(c
ombination therapy) to assess the frequency of ≥ Grade 3 adverse events and all SAEs.  
Acc

Radioembolization  using S IR-S pheres Microspheres  
Patients must be assessed with a hepatic angiogram and “break-through” scan to determine 
suitability for SIR-Spheres.   
He
patic Angiogram 
The patient will undergo a preliminary angiogram of the liver to determine the vascular 
anatomy of the liver.  The hepatic angiogram will provide a road map of the arterial supply of 
the liver
 in order to plan delivery of the SIR-Spheres microspheres.  The hepatic angiogram 
shoul
d be performed together with the ‘break-through’ scan and results must be available 
prior to radioembolization with SIR-Spheres (see Appendix Appendix A /Appendix B ). 
L
iver-Lung Break-Through Nuclear Scan 
In order to mitigate the possibility of including patients who exhibit excessive liver- to- lung 
shunting a nuclear medicine ‘break-through’ scan using 99mTechnetium (Tc) macroaggregated 
albumin will be performed in all patients prior to SIR-Spheres treatment.  Excessive liver- to- lung 
shunting resulting in radiation damage to the lungs has not been observed in any case of 
colorectal metastatic liver disease treated since the premarket approval  (PMA) of SIR-Spheres 
mi
crospheres for mCRC in 2003 . 
I
f either the hepatic angiogram or the liver-lung break through nuclear scan shows that a patient 
is ineligible to receive SIR-Spheres, then the patient will be removed from study and replaced. 
SIR-Spheres Microspheres Administration 
S
IR-Spheres microspheres will be administered by a certified radiation oncologist, interventional 
ra
diologist, or nuclear medicine physician to the patient by injection through a trans-femoral 
c
atheter into the hepatic artery.  All areas of tumor within the liver will be targeted with SIR-
S
pheres microspheres which usually involves treating both lobes of the liver.  However, it is vital 
that the S
IR-Spheres microspheres are not delivered to other organs such as the duodenum, 
stomach, pancreas etc. 
If the metastases are limited to only one lobe, the radiologist can insert the catheter selectively 
into the lobar artery supplying only that lobe that contains the metastases.  The SIR-Spheres 
mi
crospheres will then be delivered only to the lobe containing the metastases with sparing of 
the other normal lobe. The SIR-Spheres microspheres are injected slowly into the hepatic artery 
to avoid re
flux back down the hepatic artery and placement in the pancreas, stomach and other 
orga
ns. 
After SIR-Spheres microspheres ha ve been administered, the patient will be monitored closely 
during
 the following 2 week rest period prior to starting regorafenib (see Section 7).  If liver 
function toxicities are present, the patient may be rechecked weekly for 2 additional weeks.

Page 33 of 98 Regorafenib Administration    
All patients entering this study will receive regorafenib at a dose of 160 mg orally once daily on 
Da
ys 1-21 of each 28 day cycle.   
P
atients will be instructed to take regorafenib with a low-fat breakfast that contains less than 
30% 
fat.  Examples of a low-fat breakfast include 2 slices of white toast with 1 tablespoon of 
low-fat marg arine and 1 tablespoon of jelly, and 8 ounces of skin milk (319 calories and 8.2 
grams fat); or 1 cup of cereal, 8 ounces of skim milk, 1 slice of toast with jam, apple juice, and 1 
cup of coffee or tea (520 calories and 2 grams fat).  The time of day for administration of 
re
gorafenib should be consistent.    
I
f the patient misses a dose of study drug, the patient should take the dose as soon as possible, 
but not less than 12 hours before the next dose is due for once daily dosing.  If the next dose is 
due in less than 12 hours for once daily the patient should skip the missed dose and take the next 
dose as scheduled. 
If vomiting occurs after taking the study medication, the patient should be instructed not to 
retake the dose.  Patients should take the next scheduled dose of regorafenib.  If vomiting persists 
the patient should contact the investigator. 
No routine prophylactic anti-emetics will be given.  However, antiemetics may be administered 
with nausea and vomiting when they occur, and may be given prophylactically afterwards. 
5.2 T reatment Duration 
Patients will be evaluated for toxicity at the start of each 28-day cycle of regorafenib.  Patients 
will be restaged at 6 weeks and 12 weeks after S IR-Spheres in both cohorts, and every 8 weeks 
thereafter, with imaging, laboratory chemistries, and tumor markers as defined in Appe ndix A  
and Appendix B E rror! Reference source not found. .  Patient s will continue on treatment until 
progression as defined in Appendix C  or intolerance to side effects.  
5.3 Conco mitant Medications 
Patients will be instructed not to take any additional medications during the course of the study 
without prior consultation with the research team.  At each visit, the patient will be asked about 
any new medications he is taking or has taken after the start of the study drug. 
5.3.1 Permitted Concomitant Medications 
Premedication with anti-emetics is allowed according to standard practice guidelines.  At each 
visi
t, the patient will be asked about any new medications he is taking or has taken after the start 
of the study drug. 
All concomitant medications and significant non-drug therapies taken ≤14 days prior to the start 
of
 study drug should be recorded. 
Medic
ations may be administered for maintenance of existing conditions prior to study 
enrollment or for a new condition that develops while on study, including but not limited to the 
following: 
 Use of bisphosphonates and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand

If toxicity occurs, the toxicity will be graded utilizing the NCI CTCAE v4.0, and appropriate 
supportive c
are treatment will be administered to decrease the signs and symptoms thereof.  
Dose adjustments will be based on the organ system exhibiting the greatest degree of toxicity. 
6.1 Dose  Modifications Due to Hematologic Toxicity 
Dose r
eductions or holds and initiation of supportive care are allowed as clinically indicated by 
the treating physician.  Patients whose treatment is delayed due to toxicity will discontinue study 
drug or will proceed with the next cycle of treatment when toxicity has improved (as long as the 
toxicity resolves within 3 weeks) according to the dose modifications below.  Two dose 
re
ductions for toxicity will be allowed.  In addition, dose reductions will also be allowed based 
on clinical judgment of the treatment physician.  If persistent toxicity occurs despite two dose 
reductions, the patient will be removed from the study.   
Patients who require a treatment delay of more than 3 weeks due to treatment-related toxicity 
will
 be discontinued from study treatment, unless the treating physician and the Medical Monitor 
a
gree that continued treatment at lower doses is in the best interest of the patient.

The dose reduction guidelines for non-hematologic toxicities are shown in Table 6 .  If a Grade 
3 non-hematologic toxicity that is expected to be manageable and reversible with dose reduction 
oc
curs, treatment with regorafenib should be held until the toxicity resolves to ≤ Grade 1.  If the

ade 3 non-hematologic toxicity lasts longer than 7 days, study drug will be discontinued.  
Pa
tients with Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity lasting ≥ 7 days that does not resolve to 
 Grade 1 within 3 weeks should also be removed from the study, unless the treating physician 
a
nd the Medical Monitor agree that continued treatment at lower doses is in the best interest of 
the patient.  If a Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity occurs, study drug will be discontinued. 
I
f Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity other than nausea, vomiting, or alopecia occurs, 
tre
atment with regorafenib should be held, and should be resumed at 1-level dose reduction(s) 
(se
e Table 1) as soon as the toxicity resolves to ≤ Grade 1.  Dose reductions will also apply for 
na
usea and vomiting if the toxicity is Grade 3 or 4 and persists for 7 days after maximal 
a

 Hold dose until  recovery to ≤ Grade 2  (for AEs in 
Cycle 1: resolution to ≤ Grade 1) , then resume 
regorafenib  at one lower dose level.   
For AEs occurring in Cyc le 2 or later the investigator 
may consider a retreatment at the dose Level 0.  
If subject experiences a second Grade 3 toxicity, 
withhold dose until toxicity is ≤ Grade 2, then reduce 
1 dose level and resume treatment.  
Grade 4b Discontinue treatment.  For certain toxicities such  as 
laboratory assessments (e .g., lipase  increase without 
signs of a clinical  pancreatitis), a decision about the 
further  continuation and dose of treatment has to  be 
determined after discussion between  investigator and 
the sponsor.    
aThe investigator may consider lowering the regorafenib dose level in the case of Grade 1-2 toxicities which interfere with the 
activities of daily life, such as long lasting fatigue, anorexia, etc .   
bSubjects who develop Grade 3 hyperlipasemia or hyperamylasemia without clinical or other evidence of pancreatitis, or Grade 
3/Grade 4 hypophosphatemia may continue study treatment without interruption if this is deemed medically acceptable by the 
investigator.  Relevant diagnostic measures to exclude other adverse events leading to hyperlipasemia, hyperamylasemia, or 
hypophosphatemia will be mandatory before dosing of regorafenib is continued.

Patients will be reassessed for response according to RECIST v1.1 ( Appe ndix C ) at Weeks 6 and 
12 after SIR -S pheres with CT scans in both cohorts .  After completing  SIR-Spheres and 2 cycles 
of regorafenib p atients  may continue regorafenib treatment alone , if tumor response is stable or 
be
tter.  Patients continuing treatment after Week 12 will have r esponse re-assessed  at 8-w eek 
intervals (±1 week).  Patients with progressive disease (PD) or unac ceptable tox icity will  be 
disconti
nued from the study .     
The
 following assessment will be performed:   
o C
T scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  I f CT chest is normal at baseline this does 
not have to be repeated with each restaging unless there is a clini cal reason to do so.   
If a CT scan is not possible, then an MRI may be used . 
As noted above in the Day 1 assessments for all cycles, CEA tumor markers must be assessed on 
Da
y 1 of each cycle and at the End-of-Treatment visit .  
7.6 E nd-of-Treatment Visit 
Patients are permitted to continue treatment with regorafenib until disease progression, or the 
pa
tient is discontinued due to unacceptable toxicity or decision to discontinue treatment by the 
patient or the study physician.    
If treatment is discontinued because of toxicity or any other reason(s) at a treatment visit and no 
study treatment is administered, that visit may fulfill the End-of-Treatment visit. 
Af
ter withdrawal from or completion of protocol treatment, patients must be followed for any 
new AEs for 30 calendar days after the last dose of study drug.

8.1.3
 Precautions and Risks Associated with SIR-Spheres® Microspheres 
Ove
rall, the incidence of complications after SIR-Spheres microspheres therapy, if patients are 
se
lected appropriately and target (i.e. liver) delivery is performed meticulously, is low. 
Gastroduodenal complications occur in less than 10% of those treated ( Bester et al. 2011; 
Ke
nnedy et al. 2006 ;Stubbs et al. 2004) and are largely preventable.  
A life
-threatening complication, progressive pulmonary insufficiency secondary to radiation-
induced lung fibrosis can be avoided by excluding from treatment with SIR-Spheres 
microspheres any patient with marked hepato-pulmonary shunting ( Leung et al. 1995). There 
ha
ve been rare reported occurrences of this complication since that time. 
The
 gallbladder also may receive SIR-Spheres microspheres through a patent cystic artery 
lea
ding to radiation cholecystitis. In order to avoid this potential complication, infusion distal to 
the cystic artery is preferred, however the risk of radiation cholecystitis requiring 
cholecystectomy is low ( Liu et al. 2005 ). 
Ga
stric and duodenal ulceration have been reported to occur after the use of SIR-Spheres 
microspheres and are related to the inadvertent intestinal deposition of microspheres via ext ra-
hepatic visceral arterial branches. Even in the absence of extra-hepatic activity on 99mTc labelled 
MAA and Bremsstrahlung emission images, gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported to 
develop. The risk of gastrointestinal ulceration can be minimised with routine coil embolization 
of
 the extra-hepatic visceral arteries before infusion of SIR-Spheres microspheres ( L iu et al. 
2005).  
R
adioembolization induced liver disease (REILD) is a rare complication following selective 
internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with 90Y microspheres. REILD is characterised by a well-
defined constellation of temporal, clinical, biochemical and histopathologic findings. REILD 
typically manifests approximately 4-8 weeks post-SIRT and is characterised clinically by 
jaundice and ascites in the absence of tumour progression or bile duct obstruction. The typical 
biochemical picture of REILD is an elevated bilirubin (> 3mg/dL) in almost all cases, elevated 
ALP and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) in most cases, accompanied by virtually no 
change in the transaminases (AST and ALT) In the event that a liver biopsy is performed, the 
typical histological appearance is of sinusoidal obstruction that may resemble veno-occlusive 
disease.  
REILD may occur in both non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic patients. In non-cirrhotic patients, the main 
risk f
actors for the development of REILD include prior exposure to systemic chemotherapy and 
whole-liver SIRT. In cirrhotic patients, the main risk factors are small liver volume (<1.5 L) and 
elevated bilirubin (1.2 mg/dL) at baseline. It is relevant to note that REILD is indeed very rare in 
the setting of an otherwise healthy liver and is largely confined to patients with a well-known

Page 51 of 98 liver condition such as cirrhosis or who have been exposed to any form of potential liver insult, 
most usually prior chemotherapy. Patients presenting with small liver volumes (< 2.0 L) and low 
proportional tumour burden (< 0.20) may be at higher risk of developing REILD independent of 
other factors; appropriate dose recommendations per the study protocol should be strictly 
adhered to in these cases.  
The treatment of REILD may comprise tapering high dose corticosteroids and ursodeoxicolic 
acid. Low molecular weight heparin may also be considered but both corticosteroids and heparin 
may only be useful if commenced very early in the course of the disease. 
Apart from the above listed major complications2 other side effects and complications include: 
In approximately one-third of patients, administration of SIRT causes immediate short term 
abdominal pain requiring narcotic analgesia. 
 
Post SIRT treatment lethargy and mild nausea are common symptoms and can last up to ten days 
and may require medication. 
 
Most patients develop a mild fever that may last for several days following SIRT administration. 
This fever does not require treatment. 
The most common potential serious complications result from either (1) inadvertent 
a
dministration of SIR-Spheres microspheres into the gut resulting in gastritis/duodenitis or (2) 
ra
diation induced liver disease resulting from a radiation overdose to the normal liver 
pa
renchyma.  The incidence rate of gastritis/duodenitis can be reduced by experience and 
meticulous a
ttention to the administration procedure so as to ensure that there is a minimal 
chance of SIR-Spheres microspheres entering small arteries supplying the gut. Radiation induced 
liver disease is largely, but not totally, preventable by using correct SIR-Spheres microspheres 
doses a
nd making allowances for dose reduction when there is increased risk of causing radiation 
damage such as in pre-existing liver damage, poor liver reserve or small volume tumour mass in 
the liver. The reported incidence of gastritis/duodenitis is <10%, while the reported rate of 
radiation induced liver disease is < 1%. 
R
are complications that have been reported include acute pancreatitis resulting from SIR-
Spheres microspheres refluxing back down the hepatic artery and lodging in the pancreas and 
liver abscess from infection of necrotic tumour. Previously reported radiation pneumonitis has 
not been observed where appropriate treatment workup and dose reductions are followed. 
There is some evidence that there is a decrease in leucocyte levels, with a nadir eight weeks after 
implantation. This has been evident in both first line and refractory studies.The median number 
of
 leukocytes was 3.55 x 109/L  (NCIC CTC3 Grade 1). Leukocyte levels recover from this 
point
, with the median value rising to normal levels 4-8 weeks after the decline.

8.2.3.1
 In-Vitro Radiosensitization Study of Regorafenib and Radiation in 
Adenocarinoma Cell Lines 
The radiosensitization of the Regorafenib / radiotherapy combination was evaluated in 
a
denocarcinoma cell lines. The purpose of the study was to determine the extent to which 
Regorafenib would potentiate the tumoricidal effect of radiation. Colorectal adenocarcinoma cell 
lines were subjected to selected combinations of regorafenib concentrations and exposure to 
radiation. The addition of regorafenib to radiation did not enhance radiosensitization irrespective 
of the timing or temporal sequencing of the two agents. Moreover, there was no dose-dependent 
relationship observed in the radiosensitization of cancer cell lines. Based on the results of this 
study, Regorafenib is not an intrinsic radiosensitizer in colorectal cancer cells.  A detailed report 
of study findings is included in Appendix H .

olid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 (see Appendix C ).  Le sions are either measurable or non-
measurable according to the criteria.  The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not

Page 53 of 98 10. S TATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
10.1 S tatistical Design 
The safety of two treatment cohorts will be evaluated in this open-label study.  The 
administration sequence of radioembolization with SIR-Spheres and regorafenib is different in 
the two tr
eatment cohorts.  The treatment cohorts are:  
Cohort 1  Regorafenib (one cycle) followed by SIR-Spheres followed by re-initiation of 
regorafenib 2-4 weeks after SIR-Spheres 
Cohort 2  SIR-Spheres followed by regorafenib to start 2-4 weeks after SIR-Spheres 
Enrollment to Cohort 1 will be completed before Cohort 2 begins enrolling patients.  All patients 
will take regorafenib, orally once-a-day, on Days 1-21 of a 28-day treatment cycle.  Twenty-five 
pa
tients will be treated in each cohort.   
Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of two treatment cohorts combining 
re
gorafenib and SIR-Spheres in patients with refractory mCRC with liver metastasis. 
Se
condary Objectives 
The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the overall response rate (O RR ), 
progression free survival (PFS), and OS of patients with refractory mCRC when treated with 
c
ombination SIR-Spheres and regorafenib in the two sequencing cohorts. 
Exp
loratory Objectives 
The exploratory objectives will evaluate the status of biomarkers and correlate the clinical 
outcomes of patients treated in the two SIR-Spheres and regorafenib cohorts. 
10.2 S ample Size Considerations 
There is no formal hypothesis testing in this study. The sample size of 50 patients (25 in each 
cohort) is based on clinical practicalities rather than statistical reasoning, in order to evaluate the 
sa
fety of the 2 different sequences in treatment administration of SIR-Spheres microspheres and 
regorafenib.  
With 25 patients per cohort, the 95% confidence interval for the response rate estimate would be 
no more
 than 21%. 
10.3 Anal ysis Population 
The following analysis populations will be used: 
 I ntent- To-Treat Population (ITT) is defined as all patients who have started study 
treatment (Radioembolization with SIR-Spheres 90Y or regorafenib). 
 S afety Population is defined as all patients who have received at least one dose of study 
treatment.  In this instance, the ITT and safety populations would consist of the same 
patients.

Descriptive statistics, including mean, median, standard deviations and ranges for all continuous 
measures will be tabulated and reported.  Percentages and frequencies for all categorical 
measures will also be presented.  Time to events endpoints will be reported using Kaplan-Meier 
e
stimates, with 95% confidence intervals for median time to event.  
10.4.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics will be summarized for each cohort.  Data to 
be tabulated will include demographic features such as age, sex and race, as well as disease-
specific characteristics. 
The number and percentages of patients screened, treated, completed the treatment/study and 
withdrawn from treatment/study for any reasons will be presented overall and also by cohort. 
10.4.2
 Efficacy Analysis 
All efficacy analyses will be performed using the Intent- To-Treat Population.  
 Ove rall Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with observed CR 
or
 PR (i.e. 2 CRs or PRs at least 4 weeks apart) according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria.  
 
 P rogression Free Survival (PFS), defined as the time from the first day of study drug 
administration (Day 1) to disease progression as defined by the RECIST v1.1 criteria, or 
de
ath on study.  Patients who are alive and free from disease progression will be censored 
at the date of last adequate tumor assessment. 
 
 Ove rall Survival (OS), defined as the time from the first day of study drug administration 
(Day 1) to death.  Patients who are alive will be censored at the date of last known date 
a
live. 
For ORR, the estimates and the associated 95% confidence interval (based on the Clopper-
Pearson method) in each treatment group will be calculated.   
For PFS and OS, Kaplan-Meier curves will be generated and the median time to event and the 
associated 95% confidence interval will be provided.   
10.4.3
 Early Safety Monitoring and Stopping Rules 
A safety review for toxicity by the Medical Monitor will occur after the first 10 patients have 
be
en enrolled in each cohort and treated with one cycle of regorafenib and SIR-spheres 
(c
ombination therapy) to assess the frequency of ≥ Grade 3 adverse events and all SAEs.  
Acc
rual will not be halted while the analysis is being conducted.   
Stopping Rules Due to Toxicities of Combination Therapy 
Stopping rules due to toxicities assessed as related to combination therapy by the Medical 
Moni
tor will be defined as follows: 
 A pati
ent death considered to be caused by AEs of combination therapy

combination therapy; 
 More than 2 patients that develop Grade 3 AST, ALT, or total bilirubin assessed as 
re
lated to combination therapy; 
 More than 2 patients develop Grade 3 bleeding in the lung, stomach, small intestine, or

r assessed as related to combination therapy. 
I
f the early stopping rules are met or safety signals emerge from the group of the first 10 patients 
tre
ated with combination therapy in each cohort, patient recruitment will discontinue and the 
stud
y will be reassessed.  Any outcome of these safety reviews will be communicated in a timely 
manne
r to the participating investigators so that they may notify their IRBs.   
10.4.4 Safety Analysis 
Safety will be assessed through the analysis of the reported incidence of treatment-emergent 
AEs.  Treatment-emergent AEs are those with an onset on or after the initiation of therapy, and 
will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v 4.03  A copy of CTCAE scoring system may be 
down
loaded from: http:// evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-
14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf .  AEs that occur prior to initiation of therapy (after consent is 
signed, i.e. during mapping for SIR-Spheres treatment), will also be assessed. 
The AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), and 
summarized using system organ class and preferred term by cohort for all patients in the Safety 
P
opulation.  In addition, summaries of SAEs, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, AEs by 
maximum NCI CTCAE grade, and AEs related to study treatment will also be presented by 
treatment cohort. 
Other safety endpoints including laboratory results will be summarized for all patients in the 
S
afety Population.  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization-Drug Dictionary 
and they will be listed and summarized by treatment cohort. 
10.5 Anal ysis Time Points 
10.5.1 Final Analysis 
The
 final analysis of the study will occur 6 months after the last patient has been recruited into 
the stud
y.   
11. SAFETY REPORTING AND ANALYSES 
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording protocol-defined AEs and Serious 
AEs (S
AEs), measurement of protocol-specified hematology, clinical chemistry, and other 
protocol-specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study drug.

11.1 De finitions   
11.1.1 Adverse Events 
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An adverse event (also known as adverse 
experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the use of a drug, without any judgement about 
causality.   An adverse event can arise with any use of the drug (e.g., off-label use, use in 
combination with another drug) and with any route of administration, formulation, dose or 
including overdose. 
11.1.2 Serious Adverse Event 
An AE or a suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is considered “serious” if, in the view of 
e
ither the investigator or sponsor,  it results in  any of the following outcomes:  
 De ath 
 A lif e-threatening AE (Note: the term “life -threatening” refers to an event/reaction 
in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event/reaction; it does not 
refer to an event/ reaction which hypothetic ally might have caused death if it were 
more severe)  
 In patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
 A per sistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.   
It is important to distinguish between “serious” and “severe” AE, as the terms are not 
synonymous.  Severity is a measure of intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not 
necessarily be considered serious.  Seriousness serves as the guide for defining regulatory

Date of Amendment #1:  15 April 2014      Version 2.0 
Page 57 of 98 reporting obligations.  “Serious” is a regulatory definition and is based on patient/event outcome 
or action usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or vital functions.  
For example, nausea which persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but may 
not be considered an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke which results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered only a mild stroke, but would be considered an SAE.  Severity and 
seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs on the eCRF and SAEs on the 
SAE Report Form. 
11.1.3 Adverse Reaction 
An adverse reaction means any adverse event caused by a drug.  Adverse reactions are a subset 
of all suspected adverse reactions where there is a reason to conclude that the drug caused the 
event. 
11.1.4 Suspected Adverse Reaction 
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event.  Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  A suspected adverse 
reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means 
any adverse event caused by a drug. 
11.1.5 Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events 
Recording of Adverse Events 
All AEs of any patient during the course of the research study will be recorded in the eCRF, and 
the inve
stigator will give his or her opinion as to the relationship of the AE to the study material 
or process (i.e., whether the event is related or unrelated to study drug administration, SIR-
S
pheres microspheres or SIRT procedure ). 
All AEs should be documented.  A description of the event, including its date of onset and 
resolution, whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE) or not, any action taken (e.g., 
changes to study treatment), and outcome, should be provided, along with the investigator’s 
a
ssessment of causality (i.e., the relationship to the study treatment[s]).  For an AE to be a 
suspec
ted treatment-related event there should be at least a reasonable possibility of a causal 
relationship between the protocol treatment and the AE.  Adverse events will be graded 
according to the NCI CTCAE v4.0, and changes will be documented. 
I
f the AE is serious, it should be reported immediately to SCRI Innovations Safety Department.  
Othe
r untoward events occurring in the framework of a clinical study are to be recorded as AEs 
(i.e
., AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment that are related to a protocol-
manda
ted intervention, including invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or 
no treatment run-in). 
Any clinically significant signs and symptoms; abnormal test findings; changes in physical 
examination; hypersensitivity; and other measurements that occur will be reported as an AE, and 
collected on the relevant e CRF  screen.

r reasoning for this decision in the patient’s medical record and as a comment on the 
eCRF screen.   
After 30 days of completion of protocol-specific treatment or discontinuation, only AEs, SAEs, 
or deaths assessed by the investigator as treatment related are to be reported. 
11.1.6 Assessment of Adverse Events 
All AEs and SAEs whether volunteered by the patient, discovered by study personnel during 
questioning, or detected through physical examination, laboratory test, or other means will be 
reported appropriately.  Each reported AE or SAE will be described by its duration (i.e., start and 
e
nd dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to the study drug 
(see following guidance), and actions taken. 
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply the 
following general guideline: 
Unrelated:  No relationship between the experience and the administration of study 
device or drug; related to other etiologies such as concomitant medications 
or patient’s clinical state. 
Unlikely:  The current state of knowledge indicates that a relationship is unlikely. 
Possibly Related: A reaction that follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration 
of the study device or drug and follows a known response pattern to the 
suspected study material.  The reaction might have been produced by th e 
patient’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the 
patient. 
Probably Related: A reaction that follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration 
of the study device or drug and follows a known response pattern to the 
suspected study material.  The reaction cannot be reasonably explained by 
known characteristics of the patient’s clinical state or other modes of 
therapy administered to the patient. 
Definite: There is a definite relationship between the experience and the 
administration of study device or drug.

Date of Amendment #1:  15 April 2014      Version 2.0 
Page 60 of 98 11.2 S erious Adverse Event Reporting by Investigators 
Adverse events classified by the treating investigator as serious require expeditious handling and 
reporting to SCRI Innovations Safety Department in order to comply with regulatory 
re
quirements.  Determination of life-threatening or serious is based on the opinion of either the 
Sponsor or the Investigator.   
S
erious AEs may occur at any time from the start of study treatment through the 30 day period 
a
fter the last dose of study drug.  T he SCRI Innovations Safety Department must be notified 
of
 all SAEs, regardless of causality, within 24 hours of the first knowledge of the event by 
the treating physician or research personnel.   
To report a SAE, the SAE Report Form should be completed with the necessary information. 
The SAE report should be sent to SCRI Innovations Safety Department via fax or e-mail using 
the using the following contact information (during both business and non-business hours): 
S
CRI Innovations Safety Department 
Safety Dept. Fax #:      1-866-807-4325 
S
afety Dept. Email:     CANN.SAE@scri-innovations.com 
Transmission of the SAE report should be confirmed by the site personnel submitting the report. 
Follow-up information for SAEs and information on non-serious AEs that become serious should 
also be reported to SCRI Innovations Safety Department as soon as it is available; these reports 
shoul
d be submitted using the SCRI Innovations SAE Report Form.    
Investigators must report SAEs and follow-up information to their responsible Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) according to the policies of the responsible IRB. 
11.3 Re cording of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
11.3.1 Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms 
All AEs should be recorded individually in the patient’s own words (verbatim) unless, in the 
opinion of the Investigator or designated physician, the AEs constitute components of a 
recognized condition, disease, or syndrome.  In the latter case, the condition, disease, or 
syndrome should be named rather than each individual sign or symptom.  If a constellation of 
signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at 
the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate 
on the relevant form(s) (SAE Report Form and/or AE eCRF screen).  If a diagnosis is 
subsequently established, it should be reported as follow-up information is available.  If a 
diagnosis is determined subsequent to the reporting of the constellation of symptoms, the 
signs/symptoms should be updated to reflect the diagnosis. 
Progression of malignancy (including fatal outcomes), if documented by use of appropriate 
meth od (for example, as per RECIST criteria for solid tumors), should not be reported as an 
SAE.

Date of Amendment #1:  15 April 2014      Version 2.0 
Page 61 of 98 11.3.2 Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation 
time points.  Such events should only be recorded once on the SAE Report Form and/or the AE 
eCRF screen.  If a persistent AE becomes more severe or lessens in severity, it should be  
recorded on a separate SAE Report Form and/or AE eCRF screen. 
A r
ecurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between patient evaluation time points, and 
subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be recorded on an SAE Report Form and/or AE 
eCRF screen. 
11.3.3 Abnormal Laboratory Values 
If an abnormal laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and/or symptoms, 
the sig
n or symptom should be reported as an AE or SAE, and the associated laboratory value or 
vital sign should be considered additional information that must be collected on the relevant 
eCRF screen.  If the laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome, only the diagnosis 
ne
eds to be recorded on the SAE Report Form or AE eCRF screen. 
Abnor
mal laboratory values will be reported as an AE if: the laboratory result requires an 
a
djustment in the study drug(s) or discontinuation of treatment, and/ or laboratory findings 
re
quire additional testing or surgical intervention, a laboratory result or finding is associated with 
a
ccompanying symptoms, or a laboratory result is considered to be an AE by the investigator. 
11.3.4
 Deaths 
Deaths that occur during the protocol-specified AE reporting period that are attributed by the 
I
nvestigator solely to progression of disease will be recorded on the “Study Discontinuation” 
eCRF screen.  All other on study deaths, regardless of attribution, will be recorded on an SAE 
Re
port Form and expeditiously reported to the SCRI Innovations Safety Department. 
W
hen recording a SAE with an outcome of death, the event or condition that caused or 
contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the SAE 
Report Form and Adverse Event screen of the eCRF.  If the cause of death is unknown and 
cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, record “Death NOS” on the eCRF Adverse Event 
sc
reen.  During post-study survival follow-up, deaths attributed to progression of disease will be 
rec
orded only on the “After Progressive Disease Follow-Up” eCRF screen. 
11.3.5
 Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization, or Surgery 
Any AE that results in hospitalization or prolongation of pre-existing hospitalization should be 
doc
umented and reported as an SAE unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  
There are some hospitalizations that do not require reporting as an SAE. 
Treatment within or admission to the following facilities is not considered to meet the criteria of 
“inpatient hospitalization” (although if any other SAE criteria are met, the event must still be 
treated as an SAE and immediately reported): 
 Emer gency Department or Emergency Room

 Obse rvation or short-stay unit 
 R ehabilitation facility 
 Hospice  or skilled nursing facility 
 Nur sing homes, Custodial care or Respite care facility 
Hospitalization during the study for a pre-planned surgical or medical procedure (one which was 
planned prior to entry in the study), does not require reporting as a SAE to the SCRI Innovations 
Safety Department. 
11.3.6 Pre-Existing Medical Conditions 
A pre-existing medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such conditions 
should be recorded on the General Medical History eCRF screen.  A pre-existing medical 
c
ondition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the 
condition worsens during the study.  When recording such events on an SAE Report Form and/or 
AE eCRF  screen, it is important to convey the concept that the pre-existing condition has 
changed by including applicable descriptors. 
11.3.7 New Cancers 
The development of a new primary cancer should be regarded as an AE and will generally meet 
at least one of the seriousness criteria (see Section 11.1.2).  New primary cancers are those that 
a
re not the primary reason for the administration of the study treatment and have developed after 
the inclusion of the patient into the study.  They do not include metastases of the original cancer.  
Symptoms of metastasis or the metastasis itself should not be reported as an AE/SAE, as they are 
considered to be disease progression. 
11.3.8 Pregnancy, Abortion, Birth Defects/Congenital Anomalies 
If a patient becomes pregnant while enrolled in the study, a Pregnancy Form (a paper report 
form, not available within the eCRF) should be completed and faxed to the SCRI Innovations 
S
afety Department.  SCRI Innovations Safety Department should be notified expeditiously, 
irr
espective of whether or not it meets the criteria for expedited reporting.  Abortions 
(spontaneous, accidental, or therapeutic) must also be reported to SCRI Innovations Safety 
De
partment. 
If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the male patient’s participation in 
this study, this must be reported to the SCRI Innovations Safety Department immediately.  Every 
e
ffort should be made to follow the pregnancy for the final pregnancy outcome. 
Congenital anomalies/birth defects always meet SAE criteria, and should therefore be 
expeditiously reported as an SAE, using the previously described process for SAE reporting.  A 
Pregnancy Form should also have been previously completed, and will need to be updated to 
reflect the outcome of the pregnancy.

Page 64 of 98  I ncludes AEs or SARs that may be anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the 
stud
y drug, or that occur with members of the drug class, but that have previously been 
observed under investigation 
When applicable, an unexpected adverse event may also apply to an event that is not listed in the 
current US Package Insert (USPI) or an event that may be mentioned in the USPI, but differs 
from the event because of greater severity or specificity.    
Known as Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR), these events suspected 
(b
y the Investigator or Sponsor) to be related to the study drug, are unexpected (not listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure or USPI), and are serious (as defined by the protocol) and require 
expedient submission to relevant health authorities within 7 days (fatal or life-threatening event) 
or 15 days (all serious events), or as defined by law.  The term SUSAR is used primarily in the 
re
porting of events to regulatory authorities. 
Expected AEs are those events that are listed or characterized in the USPI or current IB. 
11.4.2
 Sponsor Reporting for Clinical Studies Under an Investigational Device

 Sponsor Assessment of Unexpected Adverse Device Effects 
A
ny events determined by the PI to be unanticipated adverse device effects will be reported to the 
SCRI Innovations Safety Department  as soon as possible but not more than 10 working days after 
t
he investigator first learns of the effect.  These unanticipated adverse device effects will be reported 
to the re viewing IRB, the FDA, and the study team as soon as possible but not more than 10 working 
days after the investigator first learns of the effect. 
Any unanticipated adverse device effect will be immediately evaluated by the Sponsor-investigator. 
Should it be determined the unanticipated adverse device effect presents an unreasonable risk to 
study subjects, the study or the part(s) of the study that presents that risk will be terminated as soon 
as possible but not later than 5 working days after the Sponsor-investigator first receives notice of the 
effect. 
12. E THICAL, FINANCIAL, AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

Page 65 of 98 12.1 In stitutional Review Board Approval 
The
 clinical study protocol, informed consent form (ICF), package inserts, available safety 
information, patient documents (e.g., study diary), patient recruitment procedures (e.g., 
a
dvertisements), information about payments (i.e., Principal Investigator payments) and 
compensation available to the patients and documentation evidencing the Principal Investigator’s 
qualifications should be submitted to the IRB for ethical review and approval, prior to the study 
start. 
The Principal Investigator/Sponsor and/or designee will follow all necessary regulations to 
ensure appropriate, initial, and on-going, IRB study review.  The Principal Investigator/Sponsor 
(a
s appropriate) must submit and, where necessary, obtain approval from the IRB for all 
subsequent protocol amendments and changes to the informed consent document.  Investigators 
will be advised by the Sponsor or designee whether an amendment is considered substantial or 
non-substantial and whether it requires submission for approval or notification only to an IRB. 
S
afety updates for study drugs, will be prepared by the Sponsor or its representative as required, 
for distribution to the investigator(s) and submission to the relevant IRB. 
12.2 Re gulatory Approval 
As required by local regulations, the Sponsor will ensure all legal aspects are covered, and 
approval of the appropriate regulatory bodies obtained, prior to study initiation.  If required, the 
S
ponsor will also ensure that the implementation of substantial amendments to the protocol and 
other
 relevant study documents happen only after approval by the relevant regulatory authorities. 
12.3 In formed Consent 
Informed consent is a process by which a patient voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to 
participate in a particular study after having been informed of all aspects of the study that are 
releva
nt to the patient's decision to participate.  Informed consent is documented by means of a 
written, signed, and dated ICF. 
The ICF will be submitted for approval to the IRB that is responsible for review and approval of 
the study.  Each consent form must include all of the relevant elements currently required by the 
FDA, as well as local county authority or state regulations and national requirements. 
Before recruitment and enrollment into the study, each prospective candidate will be given a full 
explanation of the research study.  Once the essential information has been provided to the 
prospective candidate, and the investigator is sure that the individual candidate understands the  
implications of participating in this research study, the candidate will be asked to give consent to 
participate in the study by signing an ICF.  A notation that written informed consent has been 
obtaine
d will be made in the patient’s medical record.  A copy of the ICF, to include the patient’s 
signature, will be provided by the investigator to the patient. 
If an amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design or the potential risks to the 
pa
tients, the patient’s consent to continue participation in the study should be obtained .

Page 66 of 98 12.3.1 Confidentiality 
12.3.1.1 Patient Confidentiality 
Confidentiality of patient’s personal data will be protected in accordance with the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  HIPAA regulations require that, 
in orde
r to participate in the study, a patient must sign an authorization form for the study that he 
or
 she has been informed of following: 
 W hat protected health information (PHI) will be collected from patients in this study 
 W ho will have access to that information and why 
 W ho will use or disclose that information 
 Tha t health information may be further disclosed by the recipients of the information, and 
that if the information is disclosed the information may no longer be protected by federal 
or state privacy laws 
 The  information collected about the research study will be kept separate from the 
patient’s medical records, but the patient will be able to obtain the research records after 
the conclusion of the study 
 W hether the authorization contains an expiration date 
 The  rights of a research patient to revoke his or her authorization 
In the event that a patient revokes authorization to collect or use his or her PHI, the investigator, 
by regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of patient 
authorization.  For patients that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should 
be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e., that the patient is alive) at the 
end of their scheduled study period. 
I
n compliance with ICH GCP guidelines and applicable parts of 21 CFR it is a requirement that 
the investigator and institution permit authorized representatives of Sponsor, the regulatory 
authorities and the IRB direct access to review the patient’s original medical records at the site 
for verification of study-related procedures and data.  
Mea
sures to protect confidentiality include: only a unique study number and initials will identify 
pa
tients in the eCRF or other documents submitted to the Sponsor.  This information, together 
with the patient’s date of birth, will be used in the database for patient identification.  Patient 
names or addresses will not be entered in the eCRF.  No material bearing a patient’s name will 
be kept on file by Sponsor.  Patients will be informed of their rights within the ICF.

cords), all original, signed ICFs, and copies of all eCRF records, SAE Reporting forms, source 
doc
uments, detailed records of treatment disposition, and related essential regulatory documents.  
The documents listed above must be retained by the investigator for as long as needed to comply 
with national and international regulations (generally 2 years after discontinuing clinical 
development or after the last marketing approval).  Sponsor will notify the 
investigator(s)/institutions(s) when the study-related records are no longer required. 
If the investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the study, both the Sponsor 
and its representative should be prospectively notified.  The study records must be transferred to 
a
n acceptable designee, such as another investigator, another institution, or to the Sponsor.  Th e 
investigator must obtain the Sponsor ’s written permission before disposing of any records, even

Page 70 of 98 if retention requirements have been met.  All study files will be maintained by the Sponsor 
throug
hout the study, and will be transferred to the Sponsor at the conclusion of the study. 
13.4 Dat a Collection 
The study e CRF s are the primary data collection instrument for the study.  Electronic case report 
forms will be completed using the English language and should be kept current to enable the 
Sponsor to review the patients’ status throughout the course of the study. 
In order to maintain confidentiality, only study number, patient number, and date of birth will 
identif
y the patient in the eCRF.  If the patient’s name appears on any other document (e.g., 
laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be supplied to SCRI 
Innovations and replaced instead with the patient number and patient’s initials.  The investigator 
will
 maintain a personal patient identification list (patient numbers with corresponding patient 
identifiers) to enable records to be identified and verified as authentic.  Patient data/information 
will be kept confidential, and will be managed according to applicable local, state, and federal 
regulations. 
All data requested in the eCRF system must be supported by and be consistent with the patient’s 
source documentation.  All missing data must be explained.  When a required laboratory test, 
assessment, or evaluation has not been done or an “Unknown” box is not an option on the eCRF, 
a note should be created verifying that the field was “Not Done” or “Unknown”.  For any entry 
errors made, the error(s) must be corrected, and a note explaining the reason for change should 
be provided. 
The investigator will review and electronically sign and date each patient eCRF casebook 
indi
cating that the data in the eCRF has been assessed.  Each completed eCRF will be signed and 
dated by the Principal Investigator, once all data for that patient is final. 
13.5 S tudy Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting 
The
 investigator will permit study-related monitoring, quality audits, and inspections by the 
Sponsor or
 its representative(s), government regulatory authorities, and the IRB of all study-
re
lated documents (e.g., source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, 
case report forms).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable 
study-related facilities.  The investigator will ensure that the study monitor or any other 
c
ompliance or Quality Assurance reviewer is given access to all study-related documents and 
study-related facilities. 
At the Sponsor’s discretion, Source Document Verification may be performed on all data items 
or
 a percentage thereof. 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies the acceptance of potential inspection by 
g
overnment regulatory authorities, the IRB and the Sponsor or its representative(s). 
13.6 Qu ality Assurance and Quality Control 
Each study site shal l be required to have Standard Operating Procedures to define and ensure 
quality assurance/control processes for study conduct, data generation & collection, recording of 
da
ta/documentation and reporting according to the protocol, GCP and any applicable local, 
national or international regulations.

Date of Amendment #1:  15 April 2014      Version 2.0 
Page 80 of 98 Appendix C :  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 
Definitions 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 ( Eisenhauer et al. 2009 ).  Lesions are either measurable 
or non-measurable using the criteria provided below.  The term “evaluable” in reference to 
measurability will not be used, as it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy. 
Baseline Eligibility 
Measurable Disease:  Tumor lesions:  Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension 
(longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a 
minimum size of:  
 10 mm by CT by computerized tomography (CT scan slice thickness 
no greater than 5 mm).  
 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions that cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -
measurable).  
 20 mm by chest x -ray. 
 
Skin lesions:   Documentation by color photography, including a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes:   To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must b e ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by 
CT scan.  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured 
and followed.  
Non-Measurable Disease:  All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <<10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes wi th ≥10 - to <<15-mm short axis) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly non -measurable include: 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory 
breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lun g, abdominal masses, 
abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable 
by reproducible imaging techniques.  
Target Lesions:  The most reproducible measurable lesions, up to a maximum of 2 lesions per 
organ and 5  lesions in total, re presentative of all involved organs should be 
identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.   
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter), should be representative of all involved o rgans, and in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  Pathological nodes which are defined as measurable and that 
may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion or a short axis of 
≥15 mm by CT scan . 
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline 
sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted 
above, only the short a xis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor 
response.

Measurements of these les ions are not required, but the presence or 
absence of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 
Guidelines for Evaluation of Measureable Disease 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment, as 
per protocol screening requirements. 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  Imaging-based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical examination when both methods have been used to assess the 
anti-tumor effect of a treatment. 
 
Clinical Lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm in diameter.  In 
the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a 
ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Chest X -ray: Lesions on ches t X-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, a CT scan is 
preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI:  CT, MRI:  CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to 
measure lesions selected for response assessment.  This guideline has 
defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT 
slice thickness is 5mm or less.  When CT scans have slice thickness greater 
than 5  mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesio n should be twice the 
slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body 
scans).  
Ultrasound:  When the primary study  endpoint is objective response, ultrasound should 
not be used to measure tumor lesions.  It is, however, a poss ible alternative 
to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous 
lesions, and thyroid nodules.  Ultrasound may also be useful to confirm the 
complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by clinical 
examination.  
Endoscopy and Laparoscopy:  Use of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation has not yet 
been fully and widely validated.  Therefore, use of these techniques for 
objective tumor response should be restricted to validation purposes in 
special ized centers.  Such techniques can be useful in confirming complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained.  
Tumor Markers:  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper limit of normal, they mus t normalize for a subject to 
be considered in complete clinical response when all lesions have 
disappeared.

Page 83 of 98 Response Criteria 
Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.   
Partial Response (PR):  
 At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target  
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. . 
Stable Disease (SD):   
 Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for P D, taking as reference the smallest (nadir) sum of diameters 
since the treatment started.  
Progressive Disease (PD):   
 At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the smallest (nadir) sum since the treatment started, or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions.  Requires not only 20% increase, but 
absolute increase of a minimum of 5  mm over sum.  
 
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalizatio n of tumor markers.  
All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size ( <<10 mm short axis).  
Stable Disease (SD):    
 Persistence of one or more non -target lesions and/or persistence of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD):   
 Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of 
existing non -target lesions.  When the subject also has measurable disease, to 
achieve “unequivocal progression” on the basis of the non -target disease, 
there must be an overall lev el of substantial worsening in non -target disease 
such that, even in presence of SD or PR in the target disease, the overall 
tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  
 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
As detailed in Table 5 above, the best overall response is the best response recorded from the 
start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  In general, the subject’s best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation 
criteria.   
Confirmation of response (by repeat scans after 4 weeks or as specified in the protocol) is 
required for trials in which response rate is the primary endpoint, but is not required in 
randomized trials or trials with primary survival endpoints (i.e., where response is not a primary 
endpoint).

In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  
When the evaluation of a CR depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the 
residual lesion be investigated by fine needle aspirate or biopsy to confirm the CR status.  
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions, and the nodes decrease to “normal” 
size (<<10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This measurement 
shoul
d be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate progression, 
should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted earlier, this means that subjects 
with CR may not have a total sum of “zero” on the CRF.

Appendix E : Guidelines for Women of Childbearing Potential and Fertile Male Patients 
 
Acceptable Contraception Methods:    
Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming 
pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and for 2 months after 
stopp
ing treatment.   
Highly effective contraception is defined as either: 
True Abstinence When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. 
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-
ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception. 
S
terilization   When a woman of childbearing potential has had surgical bilateral 
oophor
ectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 
six weeks prior to study entry.  In case of oophorectomy alone, only 
when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by 
follow up hormone level assessment. 
M
ale Partner Sterilization  When the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the 
a
bsence of sperm in the ejaculate. 
Use of a combination of any two of the following (one from a  + one from b): 
a)  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system 
(IUS) or established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal 
methods of c
ontraception. 
b)
  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap 
(dia
phragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal 
foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository. 
 
Fertile male patients, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving offspring, 
with female partners of childbearing potential must use condoms plus spermicidal agent during 
the stud
y treatment period and for 2 months after the last dose of study drug, and should not 
fa
ther a child during this period.   
Male patients must also refrain from donating sperm during their participation in the study.  
The following are acceptable forms of barrier contraception: 
 L atex condom, diaphragm or cervical/vault cap when used with spermicidal 
foam/gel/film/cream/suppository 
Unacceptable Contraception Methods:  for women of childbearing potential include:

Pregnancies 
To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy in a subject on study treatment must be reported to 
the SC
RI Innovations Safety Department within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  The 
pr
egnancy should be followed up for 3 months after the termination of the pregnancy to 
determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and 
the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or 
newborn complications. 
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Study Pregnancy Form and reported by the 
investigator to  SCRI Innovations Safety Department.  Pregnancy follow-up should be recorded 
on the sa
me form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the study 
drug of any pregnancy outcome.  Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on 
the SAE Repor
t Form. 
Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the female partners of any males who took study 
treatment in this study.  Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes 
should be obtained from the mother. 
Women Not of Childbearing Potential are defined as Follows:   
 Women are considered post-menopausal and not of childbearing potential if they have 
had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile 
(e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms).  
 W omen who are permanently sterilized (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy).   
 Women who are >45 yea rs-of-age, not using hormone-replacement therapy and who 
have experienced total cessation of menses for at least 12 months OR who have a 
follicle
 stimulating hormone (FSH) value >40  mIU/mL and an estradiol value 
<40 pg/mL (140 pmol/L). 
 W omen who are >45 years-of-age, using hormone-replacement therapy and who have 
experienced total cessation of menses for at least 1 year OR who have had documented 
evidence of menopause based on FSH >40 mIU/mL and estradiol <40 pg/mL prior to 
ini
tiation of hormone-replacement therapy.

C
olorectal cancer is the second most co mmon cancer in the d eveloped world ( NCI  2010). Although 
app
roximately half of cases m ay be tre ated with surg ery alone,  for more ad vanced stage can cers, 
includi ng  m etastatic disease,  patient outcom es remain poor.  Selectiv e interna l radiotherapy (S IRT) 
permits high doses of ra diothe rapy to be delivered safely to liver metast ase s from colorectal cancer.  
P
rimary liv er ca ncer, hepatocellu lar carcinom a ( HCC), is no t responsiv e t o  traditio nal chemotherapy 
making it diffi cult t o tre at when inoperable. Imp roving radiotherapy tre atm en t for HCC may benefit 
from the combinations o f radiotherap y with radiosensitising drugs. Although various 
che
motherapeuti cs may be used as radiosensitisers, it is not curren tly clear which radiosensitising 
agents are most appropriate to improve clinical r esponse rates. 
In order t o address this research deficit, we have develo ped a hig h-throughp ut assa y for the 
i
dentification of radiosensitising drugs to determine the most appropriat e drugs to use wit h 
radiotherapy for sp e cific cance rs.  Historically, screening pro grammes for intrinsi c 
r
adiosensitisers have assessed anti-proliferative activity of compound libraries in vitro  in 4-da y 
a
ssays (La lly  et al. 2010), or have perform ed RNA  interferen ce to look  at the effect of g ene 
e

t
hroughput screening f or radiosensitisers in a manne r t hat directly cor rel ates with the gold 
s
tandard in vitro, i.e. clonogenic a ssay s - wh ere the ability of sing le cells to form col oni es a fter 
irradiation is directly measured to enable comparison of radiosensitivity of drugs in di fferent cel l 
lines.  Alt houg h it is the gold stan dard, clonogenic assays h ave major problems as the sol e 
tec
hnique for asse ssing radiosensitivity.  They su ffer from  time- consuming  methodo logy 
(2 weeks for col ony grow th) an d the expense (a large number of plat es and larg e v olumes o f 
m
edia and drugs are requir ed to ob tain a single surviv al curve). Moreover, low plating e fficiency  
f
or some cel l lines can al so be probl ematic (e.g. HepG2 hepatoma ce lls, which are diffi cult t o  test 
with traditional clonogenic survival assay s) and in some cas es cannot be overcome. To f acili tate 
the identification o f radiosensitising drugs,  we d eveloped an assay and confi rmed that it could be 
us
ed as a va lid su rr ogate for clonogenic surviv al in vitro . This assay was then extended 
r
obotically to screen c ompound librari es for poten tial radiosensitising agent s.

cultured in Du lbecco’s mo dified essential medi um (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fo etal cal f 
serum, 1x non-essential amino acids and 1x Pen/S trep (Gibco).  Ce lls were grown at 37º C in a 
hum
idified incubator in 95% air with 5% CO 2 and passaged twice weekly.  All experiments utilised 
expone
ntially growing cells with cell population doubling times of approximately 24 hours.  Cell cultures 
were renewed after every 15 pa ssages 
Metabolic assays.  Proliferation assays were used to  optimise cel l lines to measure t he e ffects of 
drugs and/ or radiation.  Ce lls were plated in serial d ilutions on 96- or 3 84-well plates an d treated 
with drugs and/ o r r adiatio n as appro priate.  After 24 hours, media was refreshed and cells allowed 
to proli
ferate for 5-6 cell doubling times.  As an  indicator of ce ll proliferation a fter IR, metabolic 
a
ctivity in each well was measured usi ng a coloured dye conv ert ed intrace llularly into a yellow-
fluor
escing form.  Cell culture medi a w as repl aced with DMEM con taining 10 µ g/m l dye.  Aft er 
90 mi

Clonogenic survival assay.  Cells were harvested, diluted to 10000 cells/ml and plated at 
appropriate cell numbers on 2 x 10 cm dishes/ radiation or drug dose.  After 5-6 hours for cell 
attachment, cells were treated with regorafenib for the timescales stated in the figure legends, and 
irradiated with 0-8 Gy radiation using a 137-Cs source at a dose rate of ~2Gy/ min.  Media were 
refreshed 24 hours after irradiation, and plates were incubated for 10-14 days.  Colonies were 
stained with 0.4% methylene blue in 100% methanol for colony counting, and results were used 
to generate clonogenic survival curves.

Figure 3.  Clonogenic surviv al assays for 3 co l orectal cancer ce ll lines tr eated with regorafenib  (10 or 
20 µM) p lus radioth erapy (6 Gy).  Slight radiosensitisation of RK O  cells was observed wi t h 20 µM  
r
egorafenib plus ra diation, but no statistically signifi ca nt radiosensitisation was observed to justify 
f
urther prec linical testing in vivo.  Results shown are mean values of thr ee  separa te ex periment s. 
 
Conclusions  
We have applied 2 types of laboratory assay, including the gold standard test (clonogenic survival), to 
con
firm that r eg orafenib is not an intrinsic radiosensitiser of colorectal cancer ce lls. This model system 
allows assessment of intrinsic radiosensitisation, but it should be not ed tha t i t cannot assess the 
a
ntiangiogenic e ffe ct on radiosen sitisatio n.  Such  exploratio n would require in vivo ex perimentation in 
a
n anim al model, wh ich is beyo nd the scop e of this study.  The rest of the project w ill t est othe r 
a
pproved drugs f or in trinsic radiosensitisation of colorectal can cer cel l lines and hepatoma cel l lines 
and a furth er report wil l be issued  in Octo ber 2013.

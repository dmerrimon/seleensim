Study  Design:  
This is a Phase I, randomized, double -blind study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability  and 
pharmacokinetics (PK)  of inhaled  MBS-COV  in healthy adult participant s in the part A and part B of the 
study .  A total of 4 4 male and female healthy participant s will be enrolled.  All participant s, after signing 
the Informed Consent Form (ICF), will be assessed during the screening phase. Only those participant s 
who successfully complete the screening phase and meet the study eligibility criteria will  be enrolled . 
MBS -COV  will administered via inhalation through a portable mesh  nebulizer.  
Part A (SAD phase)  
Part A is randomized, blinded  study of  a single ascending dose (SAD) phase to  evaluate the safety, 
tolerability  and PK of inhaled MBS -COV  in healthy participant s.  
All participant s will have a screening visit within 28 days of check -in (Day -1) to determine eligibility. 
Eligible particip ants will be admitted to the study center on study Day -1 at which point their eligibility to 
participate in the study will be confirmed.  Only those participant s who successfully complete the screening 
phase and meet the study eligibility criteria will pro ceed to be randomized to receive  a single dose of 
MBS -COV  or placebo in the morning of Day 1 at the assigned dose . 
Participant s will be assigned to one of up to three doses of MBS -COV  (0.3 mg/kg, 0.6 mg/kg, 1.2 mg/kg) 
and treated sequentially with increasi ng doses. Each cohort will include eight (8) participant s (6 active and 
2 placebo) per below table:

SAD phase will include a sentinel design in which 2 participant s at the given cohort d ose be initially 
enrolled. If the dose can be  well tolerated for 48 hours after full administration per site Principle  
Investigator ’s judgement , the remaining 6 participant s will be enrolled to receive a single dose of MBS -
COV  at the same dose.  
The decisio n for the escalation to the higher dose levels will be made by the study S RC after safety review 
of available information 7 -day post treatment period. The data from SAD phase will be reviewed for safety 
trends to start MAD phase . 
Part B ( MAD Phase )  
This i s a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study in approximately 20 healthy participant s. 
Doses will be selected based on a comprehensive review of the  SAD data and estimates of the clinically 
efficacious dose.  
The MAD Phase of the study consists o f a screening period followed by multiple dose administrations of 
MBS -COV  or placebo through a portable nebulizer once daily for 7 consecutive days (Day 1 to Day 7). 
Participant s will be followed up for 21 days to assess post -treatment safety.  
The decision  for the escalation to the higher dose levels will be made by the study S RC after safety review

If any of the  dose escalation stopping criteria  have occurred in Part A or Part B , the S RC will make a f inal 
recommendation for dose escalation to the next cohort.  
NOTE:  The dose escalation decision through the study will not be made until the following:  
(1) All study participant s in a given cohort have been enrolled , 
(2) All such participant s have completed Treatme nt Visit 5 (Day  7) (for SAD -Part A) and Treatment 
Visit 9 (Day 9)  (for MAD -Part B) of the study or withdrawn from the study, whichever occurs 
first. 
(3) The S RC will review  the available safety data and recommend further dose escalation .  
Additionally, dose es calation stopping criteria  are defined per the below:  
a. Death in any participant  in which the cause of death is judged to be possibly, probably or 
definitely related to MBS -COV . 
b. The occurrence in any participant  of a severe local application site reaction (G rade 3 
which doesn’t  resolve or recur s; or Grade 4) that is judged to be possibly, probably or 
definitely related to MBS -COV . 
c. The occurrence in any participant  of a SAE whose causal relationship to MBS -COV  is 
judged to be probably, possibly, or definitely related to MBS -COV.  
d. The occurrence, in two or more participant s of Grade 3 AE or laboratory abnormalities, 
judged to be probably, possibly, or definitely related to MBS -COV . 
e. The occurrence of two of the same AE or laboratory abnormality ≥ Grade 3 judged to  be 
probably, possibly, or definitely related to MBS -COV . 
f. The occurrence, in one or more participant s of Grade 4 AE or laboratory abnormalities, 
judged to be probably, possibly, or definitely related to MBS -COV . 
g. Any pattern of significant symptoms, physica l findings, or laboratory abnormalities that, 
although individually minor, collectively represent a safety concern in the opinion of the 
investigator and are judged by the SRC  to be at least possibly related to MBS -COV . 
h. PK exposure limits of mean AUC of 385.6 h*ng/mL or C max of 141.8 ng/mL for one 
cohort, whichever comes first. (Single dose: AUC of 386.9 h*ng/mL or C max of 91.7 
ng/mL)  
The SRC  will review the PK data (if applicable)  and safety trends of available information 7 -day post 
treatment period of Coh ort A1 and A2  (or if study stops prematurely due to safety reasons), to start part B 
of the study. The starting dose of Part B will be determined by SRC .

The design , conduct , and reporting of this study  shall be conducted in compliance with the 
protocol, International Council for Harmoni sation/Good Clinical Practice ( ICH/GCP ), and all 
appropriate regul atory requirements. I nvestigator (s) participating in this  study will ha ve 
documented training in GCP. Independent monitoring of the study  will be accomplished utilizing 
a Contract Research Organization (CRO).  
1.2. BACKGROUND OF THE DISEASE  
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2) has infected over  500 million 
people and caused more than 6.2 million deaths worldwide as of April 26, 2022, according to the 
John Hopkins coronavirus resource center. Despite the availability of vaccines, breakthrough 
infections caused by the variant appear to be driving a new wave of pandemic (Dyer 2021, 
Kupferschmidt 2021). The SARS -CoV -2 vaccines initially achieved great success in reducing 
viral infection and severe illness. The effectiveness of ChAdOx1 nCoV -19, BNT162b2 and 
mRNA -1273 vaccine reached 70.4%, 95% and 94. 1%, respectively (Baden 2021, Knoll 2021, 
Wang 2021). Nevertheless, the emergence of new variants has raised great concerns, since 
reduced sensitivity of SARS -CoV -2 variants to therapeutic neutralizing antibodies, serum from 
convalescent patients and vacci nated individuals have been reported (Planas 2021). A report 
from the UK indicates that the effectiveness of two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV -19 vaccine against 
delta infection reduces to 67% while BNT162b2 reduces to 88% (Lopez 2021). Another report 
from Qatar s howed that two doses of BNT162b2 only present 51.9% of effectiveness while 
mRNA -1273 presents 73.1% (Tang 2021). These reports implicate those viral mutations has 
influenced vaccine effectiveness.  
Recently, a novel variant called Omicron, is spreading rap idly across the globe. The unusual, 
clustered mutations and extensive transmission of this variant led the World Health Organization 
to designate it as a variant of concern on November 26, 2021. In total, 32 mutations were 
identified in Omicron’s spike pro tein and 15 in the receptor -binding domain, which are 
responsible for interacting with the angiotensin -converting enzyme 2 receptor. The highly 
mutated features of Omicron have allowed it to escape most of the existing SARS -CoV -2 
neutralizing antibodies (C ao 2021). A more than 22 -fold reduction of neutralizing titers against 
the Omicron strain as compared to the wild -type strain was observed in individuals receiving 2 -
dose of mRNA vaccine, and a third dose of mRNA vaccine was suggested (Muik 2022). 
Moreover , an artificial intelligence model trained with tens of thousands of experimental data 
and extensively validated based on experimental results for SARS -CoV -2 indicated that Omicron 
may be over 10 times more contagious than the original virus and about 2.8 times more 
infectious than the Delta variant (Chen 2022). The emergence of Omicron variant indicates how 
fast the SARS -CoV -2 evolves, and its potential impact on the current protein -based intervention

protein (Van 2020) cannot be neglected.  
One therapeutic with great potential is short -interfering (si)RNA, which is an artificially 
synthesized double -stranded RNA of 19 –23 nucleotides (Zamore 2000). Upon enter ing the 
cytosol, siRNA interacts with several proteins to form an RNA -induced silencing complex 
(RISC) and subsequently knocks down the expression of target genes based on sequence 
complementarity.  
1.3. NAME AND DESCRIPTION OF THE INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
Onenes s Biotech Co., Ltd is developing MBS -COV  for the treatment of mild to moderage 
COVID -19. MBS -COV  is a potent siRNA targeting a highly conserved region of RdRP gene of 
SARS -CoV -2. It consists of double -stranded RNA with each of 21 nucleotides in length and is 
fully -modified with 2’ -O-methyl, 2′ -fluoro or phosphonothioate (PS) substitution ( Figure 1-1) 
shows the sequence and target site of MBS -COV . MBS -COV  is a double -stranded, small 
interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting a highly conserved RNA -dependent RNA polymerase region 
of SARS -CoV -2 RNA to induce the degradation effect against the virus RNA.

coronavirus 229E with pico -molar IC50 (IC50 = 0.09 
~ 0.73 nM).  
 The concentration (detected via OD26 0) and 
integrity (assayed via HPLC) of MBS -COV were 
the same before and after nebulization  
 The effectiveness of the MBS -COV after 
nebulization was the same as that before 
nebulization, evaluated by the inhibition of viral 
envelope gene expression in Vero E 6 cells.  
 The nebulization rate was maintained unaffected 
when the concentration of C6G25S was ≦30 mg/mL 
and reduced significantly at higher concentrations.  
 The C6G25S concentration in the inhalation 
chamber reached a maximum within 2 min and was 
maintained  at 1.48 mg/L.

standard deviation (GSD) of 2.402 m with a fine 
particle fraction (FPF; <5 m) of 50.22%.  
 MBS -COV was d istributed throughout the lung in 
the AI group, whereas uneven distribution in the IN 
group. There are twice as many MBS -COV+ cells in 
the AI group compared with MBS -COV 
significantly suppresses the production of viral RNA 
and infectious virions in both pr ophylactic treatment 
and co -treatment of both SARS -CoV -2-and Delta - 
infected K18 -hACE2 mice.  
 MBS -COV inhibits spike protein expression and 
prevents SARS -CoV -2-induced pathological 
features in lungs of K18 -hACE2 transgenic mice.  
 MBS -COV reduces the express ion of inflammatory 
cytokines induced by SARS -CoV -2 in lungs of K18 -
hACE2 transgenic mice . 
Secondary Pharmacology   Modification of MBS -COV  significantly reduced 
off-targets. None of the off -target genes are essential 
for cell viability.  
Safety Pharmacolog y  No cytotoxicity was observed in the treatment up to 
40M of MBS -COV . 
 No inflammation -associated cytokines were 
significantly induced in MBS -COV treated -human 
PBMCs . 
 MBS -COV does not activate non -specific immune 
response against SASR -CoV -2 in mice treated  with 
efficacy dose of MBS -COV.  MBS -COV inhibits 
viral RNA amplification and infectious virion 
production, while control siRNA does not. The virus 
inhibition of MBS -COV is not evoked through 
nonspecific immune responses . 
 No significant immune stimulation was observed in 
mice treated with high dose (up to 75 mg/kg) of 
MBS -COV . 
 No MBS -COV -related changes in cardiovascular 
functions, respiratory functions, blood pressure, 
body temperature and clinical observation  after

Pharmacokinetics  
 Lung distribution and pharmacokinetics of MBS -COV 
in lungs of golden hamsters  
 In a single inhalation of MBS -COV at delivered 
doses of 15.7 and 52.7 mg/kg, MBS -COV level in 
lungs of golden hamsters peaked at 0.5 -1 hr 
postdose.  
 The elimination T 1/2 ranged 60.95 -74.16 hours in 
low dose group and 152.20 - 182.59 hours in high 
dose group.  
 The C max were within 28.98 -30.79 μg/g lung in low 
dose group and 64.30 - 108.77 μg/g lung in high 
dose group.  
 No significant gender difference was found.  
 The maximum concentrations in lung tissue and the 
systemic exposures to MBS -COV were positively 
correlated with the administrated doses.  
Toxicokinetics of MBS -COV in the blood of golden 
hamsters  
 In the 7 -day repeat -dose toxicokinetic study, the 
actual delivered doses were 30 and 90.4 mg/kg for 
medium and high dose group. The elimination T 1/2 
values ranged from 1.97 to 17.42 hours for sense 
and antisense strand of MBS -COV in medium and 
high dose group on Day 1. On Day 7, T 1/2 values 
ranged from 1.88 to 6.06 hours. Mean C max and 
AUC last values increased with the increasing 
administered doses. MBS -COV did not accumulate 
in golden hamsters, and there was no significant 
gender difference.  
 In the 14 -day repeat -dose toxicokinetic study, the 
actual delivered doses were 57 and 87.9 mg/kg for 
medium and high dose group. The elimination T1/2

CONFIDENTIAL      Page 27 of 94 Study Summary  
values ranged from 1.18 to 36.67 hours on day 1 for 
sense and antisense strand of MBS -COV in medium 
and high dose group. On day 14, T1/2 values ranged 
from 3.4 7 to 9.02 hours. Mean Cmax and AUClast 
values increased with increasing administered doses 
in both females and males. There was no significant 
gender difference. No accumulation was observed in 
male animals; in female animals, a tendency of 
accumulation wa s observed in the medium group. 
No accumulation was observed in the high dose 
group.  
Toxicology  Single Dose  
 MBS -COV  was well -tolerated in SD rat at intranasal 
instillation of 20, 40, and 75 mg/kg and the NOAEL 
was considered to be 75 mg/kg.  
Repeat Dose  
 MBS -COV was well -tolerated in CD-1 (ICR)  mice 
at intranasal instillation of 2, 10, and 50 mg/kg and 
the NOAEL was considered to be 50 mg/kg . 
 MBS -COV was well -tolerated in Golden hamster at 
inhalation of 10, 30, and 90 mg/kg and the NOAEL 
was considered to be 90 mg/kg . 
 MBS -COV was well -tolerated in Golden hamster at 
inhalation of 18, 57, and 87.9 mg/kg. Minimal to 
slight alveolar macrophage aggregation in the lung 
with bronchi was observed in medium - and high -
dose group, and could be completely recovered aft er 
a 1-week recovery period.  no obvious systemic 
toxicity and toxic target organs were found at doses 
of ≤ 87.925±21.984  mg/kg.  The NOAEL was 
considered to be 87.9 mg/kg .   
Genotoxicity  
 The bone marrow micronucleus analysis showed 
that the incidence of m icronucleus in the positive 
control group increased significantly compared with 
the vehicle control group, while the incidence of 
  SNS812CLCT01  
                                                                                                   V4.1 
 Date:  19-Jan-2022  
CONFIDENTIAL      Page 28 of 94 Study Summary  
micronucleus in all MBS -COV treatment groups did 
not. No genotoxicity was observed for MBS -COV 
to damage chromosome in bone ma rrow 
erythrocytes when CD -1 (ICR) mice were 
administered with MBS -COV at doses up to 2000 
mg/kg by intravenous injection for 2 consecutive 
days.  
 The potential of MBS -COV to cause chromosome 
aberration was evaluated  by using Chinese Hamster 
Lung (CHL) Fibro blast  continuously exposed (for 
either 4 or 24 hours) to different concentrations of 
MBS -COV with or without S9 metabolic activation. 
The chromosomal aberration rates in CHL cells 
treated with MBS -COV at all tested concentrations 
for 4 hours with or withou t S9 and 24 hours without 
S9 showed no significant difference (P>0.05) when 
compared with the vehicle control group. The results 
indicate that MBS -COV at doses ≤500 µg/mL, 
regardless of the presence or absence of the 
metabolic activation enzyme system, has no 
genotoxic potential to induce chromosome 
aberration . 
 The mutagenicity study was conducted at dose 
levels of 50, 150, 500, 1500 and 5000 µg/plate of 
MBS -COV  in both the absence and presence of S9 
activation incubated with Salmonella typhimurium 
tester strains for 65.5 hours.  Compared with the 
spontaneous control group, the revertant colony 
counts of TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102 and 
TA1535 strains in all the dose groups when treated 
with or without S9 were within the negative 
historical background range. MBS -COV at 
concentrations ≤5000 µg/plate is not mutagenic in 
the presence or absence of metabolic activation.  
Systemic Anaphylaxis Study  
 MBS -COV  did not exert any systemic anaphylaxis 
response in Guinea Pigs, and therefore is not 
considered a sensitizer .

CONFIDENTIAL      Page 29 of 94 1.4.2.  Clinical Studies  
The curr ent proposed study is a first -in-human study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK 
of inhaled  MBS -COV . 
1.5. RISKS / BENEFIT S ASSESSMENT  
1.5.1.  Systemic Anaphylaxis  
The potential of MBS -COV to provoke respiratory sensitization reactions was evaluated in 
Hartley guinea pigs (n = 9 per groups). Three sensitization inductions with either MBS -COV 
(actual delivered doses of 3.8 and 15.1 mg/kg) or vehicle  control (saline) were performed by 
inhalation every other days (Day 1, 3 and 5), followed by a challenge of MBS -COV  (actual 
delivered doses of 8.1 and 32.6 mg/kg) by inhalation at two or three weeks after the last 
induction (Day 19 or 26). After challenged, the animals were observed for multiple symptoms 
for 3 hours. In conclusion, MBS -COV did not exert any systemic an aphylaxis response in 
Hartley guinea pigs, and therefore is not considered as a sensitizer . 
1.5.2.  Pregnancy  
To date, no carcinogenicity and reproductive studies have been conducted with MBS -COV . 
Risks to unborn babies are unknown at this time, thus pregnant fema les will be excluded from 
this study. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to 
enrollment and must agree to use appropriate birth control methods throughout the study 
duration (excluding women who are not of childbeari ng potential).  
1.5.3.  Venipuncture for Blood Sampling  
Venipuncture for blood sample collection carries a minimal risk of minor discomfort and the 
possibility of minor bruising at the site of the needle puncture and, rarely, the possibility of 
infection at the nee dle puncture site.  
1.5.4.  Unknown Risks  
As with all research there is the remote possibility of risks that are unknown or that cannot be 
foreseen based on current information.  
1.6. RATIONALE FOR STUDY DOSE   
Golden hamster was well -tolerated at inhalation doses of 10, 30, and 90 mg/kg of MBS -COV  
once daily for 7 days in the dose ranging finding (DRF) study and 18, 57, and 87.9 mg/kg for 14 
days in the GLP compliance study. There were no MBS -COV -related clinical observations or 
toxicology effects on body weights, food in take, hematology, serum biochemistry , urinalysis  and 
histopathology. No obvious systemic toxicity and toxic target organs were found at doses of ≤ 
87.9 mg/kg.  The NOAEL was considered to be 87.9 mg/kg . 
  SNS812CLCT01  
                                                                                                   V4.1 
 Date:  19-Jan-2022  
CONFIDENTIAL      Page 30 of 94 For inhaled drug, clinical doses will need to be suppo rted by both local and systemic safety 
margins. The pulmonary deposition factor (10% for hamster) was considered in the calculations 
for systemic safety. Based on the calculation (based on 1.2  mg/kg as human dose) shown as 
below, for the first in human sta rting dose (0.3 mg/kg) and maximum dose (1.2 mg/kg), the 
safety margin of systemic toxicity is 3.809 and 0.952, respectively. And the safety margin of 
local toxicity is 83.89 and 20.97, respectively. As no evidence of unmonitorable systemic 
toxicity in pre clinical studies, proposed clinical doses up to 1.2 mg/kg would have adequate 
nonclinical support.  
Determining PDDs in rats and humans ： 
Assuming the NOAEL for local is the same with the NOAEL for systemic effects in the 
hamster study, 87.9 mg/kg/d.  
PDD hamster local = 87.9 mg/kg/d *0.1(DF)= 8.79 mg/kg/d  
PDD hamster system = 87.9 mg/kg/d *0.1(DF)= 8.79 mg/kg/d  
PDD human=1.2 mg/kg subject/d* 1 (DF)= 1.2 mg/kg/d  
 Determining lung doses in rats and humans  
PDD hamster, lung =8.79 mg/kg/d* 0.12 BWT/0.7g (lung hamst er) =1. 51 mg/g lung  
PDD human, lung =72 mg/d /1000  g lung hamster=0.072 mg/g lung  
 Calculating SM for systemic effects:  
SM system=8.79 mg/kg/d (hamster) *0.13（HED）/ 1.2 mg/kg/d (human)  =0.952 
 Calculating SM for local effects  
On a mg/g lung/day basis: SM local=1.51mg /g /0.072 mg/g = 20.97 
Since the safety profile of MBS -COV  in humans is unknown and this is the first clinical study to 
assess MBS -COV  in humans, ph ase I clinical study for MBS -COV  will be divided into two parts. 
Part A is a randomized, double -blind, and placebo -controlled study with single ascending dose 
(SAD) design of inhaled MBS -COV  in healthy participant s for determining safety, tolerability, 
and pharmacokinetics of MBS -COV . Part B will be performed after review of  sufficient  result of 
Part A. Part B is a randomized, double -blind and placebo -controlled study with multiple 
ascending doses (MAD) of inhaled MBS -COV  in healthy participant s to evaluate  safety, 
tolerability, and pharmacokinetics.

3.1. GENERAL SCHEMA  
This is a Phase I, randomized, double -blind study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
and PK of inhaled MBS -COV  in healthy adult participant s in the part A and part B of the study.  
A total of 44 male and female healthy participant s will be enrolled. All participant s, after signing 
the Informed Consent Form (ICF), will be assessed during the screening phase. Only those 
participant s who successfully complete the screening phase and meet the study eligibility criteria 
will be enrolled. MBS -COV  will administered via inhalation through a portable nebulizer.  
Part A (SAD phase)  
Part A is randomized, blinded study of a single ascending dose  (SAD) phase to  evaluate the 
safety, tolerability and PK  of inhaled MBS -COV  in healthy participant s.  
All participant s will have a screening visit within 28 days of check -in (Day -1) to determine 
eligibility. Eligible participant s will be admitted to the s tudy center on study Day -1 at which 
point their eligibility to participate in the study will be confirmed. Only those participant s who 
successfully complete the screening phase and meet the study eligibility criteria will proceed to 
be randomized to recei ve a single dose of MBS -COV  or placebo in the morning of Day 1 at the 
assigned dose.  
Participant s will be assigned to one of up to three doses of MBS -COV  (0.3 mg/kg, 0.6 mg/kg, 
1.2 mg/kg) to be treated sequentially with increasing doses. Each cohort will i nclude eight (8)

has been received by the investigational site. Study drug will be accounted for on an ongoing 
basis during the study.  
6.1.3.  Study Treatment  Administration   
Detailed guidelines for dose of formulation, administration technique and administration 
direction can be found in the study pharmacy manual .  
All participant s, after signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF), will be assessed during the 
screening phase. Eligible participant s who have completed the screening phase will proceed with 
treatment phase of the study. Based on the phase of the study and randomization/Enrolment, 
study pharmacist will prepare the study drug for each participant  and participant s will be dosed 
individually at the pharmacy (or) designated space in the study site. Please refer to the study 
pharmacy manual  for preparation of study drug prior to administration to each participant . 
6.1.4.  Study Treatment Dispensation  
In both part o f the study, the participant s will be enrolled /randomized using a web -based 
randomization system (IWRS) and each participant  enrolled into the study will receive assigned 
kit number including vials to be used via IWRS per the study enrolment/randomization  scheme.  
6.1.5.  Study Treatment Accountability  
Study treatments must be used in accordance with this protocol and only under the direction of 
the responsible investigator. The investigational site must maintain complete and accurate 
records showing receipt and d isposition of all study treatments, including master records listing 
the date of receipt, the number of the kits received, and a dispensing record which includes each 
quantity dispensed, identification of the staff member to whom dispensed, the date of dis pensing, 
the intended study participant number, and the identification of the preparer. All used and unused 
study kits will be retained by the investigational site until study treatment accountability can be 
confirmed by study CRA during the monitoring vis its. Instructions will be provided by Sponsor 
regarding final disposition of all study drug in compliance with applicable regulations.  
A study treatment accountability log will be provided to the site for use by the Investigator to 
maintain current and acc urate inventory records (batch, expiry, and quantity) covering the receipt, 
dispensing and the return/destruction of all the study treatments.

 7. DESCRIPTION OF PROTOCOL ASSESSMENT S AND  
PROCEDURES  
7.1. INFORMED CONSENT  
A written informed consent will be obtained for this study by the Investigator or designee from 
all participant s prior  to performance of any protocol -specific pr ocedure. This study will be 
conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki.  
The Investigator must comply with applicable regulatory requirements and must adhere to the 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) i n the process of obtaining an d documenting the informed consent . 
The Investigator, or designee, must also inform participant s of all pertinent aspects of the study. 
Before written informed consent is obtained from the participant , the Investigator  or a person 
designated by the Investi gator, must provide the participant  enough time and opportunity  to 
inquire about the details of the study and to decide whether or not to participate in the study . All 
questions addressed by the participant  about the study  must be answered to the satisfact ion of the 
participant . Prior to the participant ’s participation in the study , the written informed consent must 
be signed and personally dated by the participant  and by the person who conducted the informed 
consent discussion. Authorization for release of  protected health information must also be 
obtained, as per local policies .  
7.2. ASSESSMENT OF ELIGIBILITY  
The Investigator must assess participant ’ continued eligibility for the study as per the Inclusion 
and Exclusion criteria, during the Screening Phase. Th e eligibility  criteria are described in 
Section  3.4.1  (Inclusion Criteria) and Section  3.4.2  (Exclusion Criteria) . In the event that the 
participant  is not suitable o r eligible for the study,  the participant  will be considered “ screen 
failure ”.  
7.2.1.  Re-screening  
A participant  who signed a consent form but did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria is 
classified as a screen failure.  
Note: If a participant  initially fail s to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and is later reconsidered 
for participation, the participant  will be re -consented and assigned a new unique identification 
number at the time of re -screening. Participant s who fail their first screening attempt may be  re-
screened a maximum of once and may be enrolled if they are found to meet all inclusion and no 
exclusion criteria when re -screened.  
For consented participant s who do not meet eligibility criteria, a Screen Failure Case Report 
Form (CRF) will be complete d. The Screen Failure CRF will contain the following details: the 
participant  identification number, the date of ICF signature, demographic information (see 
  SNS812CLCT01  
                                                                                                   V4.1

 9. SAFETY REPORTING  
The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria 
and definition of an AE or SAE, as provided in this protocol. During the study when t here is a 
safety evaluation, the Investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting,  
and reporting AEs and SAEs as detailed in this Section of the protocol.  
9.1. ADVERSE EVENT (AE)  DEFINITION  
An adverse event (AE)  is defined as any unfa vorable or unintended sign, symptom, or disease 
that occurs or is reported by the participant  to have occurred, or a worsening of a pre -existing 
condition. An adverse event may or may not be related to the study treatment.  
AEs will be elicited through dir ect questioning and participant  reports. Any abnormality in 
physical examination findings or laboratory results that the investigator believes is clinically 
significant  (CS)  to the research participant  and that occurred after initiation of the first study 
treatment will be reported as AEs. Abnormal findings that are NOT clinically significant should 
not be recorded as an AE.  
9.2. REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  (AE S) 
 The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF.  All AEs will be 
collected from the time of dose administration until the safety follow -up visit. Medical 
occurrences that occur before the start of the study treatment, but after obtaining the ICF will be 
recorded in the Medical History section of the eCRF and not in the AE s ection, unless considered 
related to the study procedures.   All events will be followed to resolution or until the participant  
completes the study.  A final assessment of outcome will be made at that time.   
All AEs must be recorded in the participant ’s medi cal records and on the CRF. AEs will be 
reported using customary medical terminology along with the following information: the onset 
and end dates,  whether the event is considered to be a SAE (see Section 9.3), the impact the 
event had on study treatment (see Section 9.2.1 ), the Toxicity Grading Scale  (intensity) of the 
event (see Section 9.2.2 ), the causality of the event (see Section 9.2.3 ), whether treatment is 
given as a result of the event (see Section 9.2.4 ), and the outcome of the event (see Section 9.2.5 ). 
9.2.1.  Impact on Study Treatment  
The impact the event had on the study treatment will be assessed as either: dose increased, dose 
not changed, dose rate reduced, dose reduced, drug interrupted, drug withdrawn, not applicable, 
or unknown . The “not applicable ” assessment will be used only when the participant  is no longer

 According to the guideline of “Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy  Adult and Adolescent 
Volunteers  Enrolle d in Preventive Vaccine  Clinical Trials”  issued by FDA , the severity of 
adverse events occurred in this study will be graded.  The general guidelines for assessing the AE 
grade refer to appendix 1.  
9.2.3.  Event Causality Assessment  
AEs will be assigned a relation ship (causality) to the study treatment. The Investigator will be 
responsible for determining the relationship between an AE and the study treatment. The type of 
event, organ system affected, and timing of onset of the event will be factors in assessing th e 
likelihood that an AE is related to the study treatment. Relationship of AEs to study treatment 
will be classified as follows:  
1. Definitely related : This category applies to those AEs that the Investigator feels are 
incontrovertibly related to the study tr eatment. An AE may be assigned an attribution of 
definitely related if or when it meets all of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable 
temporal sequence from administration of the study treatment; (2) it could not be reasonably 
explained by the  known characteristics of the participant ’s clinical state, environmental or 
toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the participant ; (3) it follows a 
known response pattern to treatment with the study treatment.  
2. Probably related:  This cat egory applies to those AEs which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, are felt with a high degree of certainty to be 
related to the study treatment. An AE may be considered probable if or when (must have 
three): (1) it follo ws a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
treatment. (2) It could not readily have been produced by participant ’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other therapies administered to the participant . (3) 
Disappears or  is decreased upon discontinuation of the study treatment. (4) It follows a 
known response pattern to treatment with the study treatment.  
3. Possibly related : This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged unlikely but cannot be ruled out with 
certainty to the study treatment. An AE may be considered possible if or when (must have 
two): (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
treatment. (2) It coul d not readily have been produced by participant ’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other therapies administered to the participant . (3) 
Disappears or is decreased upon discontinuation of the study treatment. (4) It follows a 
known respons e pattern to treatment with the study treatment.  
4. Unlikely  related : In general,  this category can be considered applicable to those AEs which, 
after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged likely to be 
unrelated to the stud y treatment. An AE may be considered unlikely if or when (must have 
two): (1) it does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
treatment. (2) It could not readily have been produced by participant ’s clinical state,

 environ mental or toxic factors, or other therapies administered to the participant . (3) 
Disappears or is decreased upon discontinuation of the study treatment. (4) It does not follow 
a known response pattern to treatment with the study treatment.  
5. Unrelated : This  category applies to those AEs which, after careful consideration at the time 
they are evaluated, are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc.) and determined with certainty to have no relationship to the study 
treatment.  
9.2.4.  Treatment Given as a Result of the Event  
The event impact in terms of treatment provided will be as either: none, medication administered, 
non-drug therapy administered, surgery performed, hospitalization, or other (with a 
specification).  
9.2.5.  Event Outcome Assessment  
The outcome of the event will be assessed as either: fatal, not recovered/not resolved, 
recovered/ resolved, recovered/ resolved with sequelae, recovering/resolving , or unknown . Only 
one AE per participant  is allowed to have an outcome assess ment as “death.” If there are 
multiple causes of death for a given participant , only the primary cause of death will have an 
outcome of death.  
9.3. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  (SAE)  DEFINITION  
A SAE is defined as any AE that:  
 Results in death  
 Is life threatening (t he participant  is at immediate risk of dying from the adverse 
experience)  
 Requires participant  hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Important me dical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse effect when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant  or participant  and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition . 
9.4. REPORTING OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  (SAE S)  
The Investigator is required to report all SAEs that occur during the time period specified in 
Section  9.2. Once the Investigator becomes aware of an SAE, he/she must report the SAE to 
Safety Contact/Sponsor  within 24 hours.  The fax number or email address for reporting SAEs 
can be found in the protocol -specific Safety Management Plan.  
  SNS812CLCT01  
                                                                                                   V4.1 
 Date:  19-Jan-2022  
CONFIDENTIAL      Page 75 of 94 
 The Safety Contact/Sponsor  may request additional supporting documentation as it becomes 
available, such as lab reports, 12-lead ECG  reports, discharge summary, hospital notes, etc., if 
applicable. Additional follow -up information as it becomes available must  be reported to the 
Medical Monitor . 
The Investigator is also responsible for reporting all SAEs to the appropriate Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) in accordance with local laws and regulations. The Investigator is responsible for 
maintaining documentatio n in the study file that indicates the IRB has been properly notified.  
9.4.1.  SAE Follow -Up 
All participant s experiencing an SAE, including the discontinued participant s, must be closely 
followed until sufficient information is obtained to indicate a return to n ormal status or until the 
event stabilizes at a level acceptable to the Investigator or the last study visit, whichever occurs 
first (i.e., recovery, return to baseline status, no further improvement expected, or death).  
For each SAE indicated as an unreso lved event on the initial report, regardless of whether the 
participant  completed the study or withdrew, the site should submit a follow -up report with 
updated information . 
9.5. PREGNANCY REPORTING  
To ensure participant safety, any pregnancy that occurs while participant  is taking study drug 
should be recorded using a Pregnancy Notification Form and reported immediately to Sponsor 
within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy.  
If a participant  becomes pregnant during the study before the end of treatment period, they will 
be a discontinued participant . If a participant  becomes pregnant during the study after the end of 
treatment during the follow up portion, they can complete the remaining scheduled follow up 
unless there is a medical contraindication.  
9.5.1.  AE and SAE Reporting  
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the IP may have 
interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Congenital abnormalities/birth 
defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported an d handled as SAEs.  
9.5.1.1.  Abortions  
An induced elective abortion to terminate a pregnancy without medical reason is not regarded as  
an AE. However, an induced therapeutic abortion to terminate a pregnancy because of  
complications or medical reasons must be report ed as an SAE. The underlying medical diagnosis  
for this procedure should be reported as the SAE term. A spontaneous abortion in a study 
participant  is always considered an SAE.   
9.5.2.  Informed Consent  
  SNS812CLCT01  
                                                                                                   V4.1

CONFIDENTIAL      Page 76 of 94 
 The ICF will include information regarding reporting of preg nancy to the Sponsor and collection  
of information through the end of pregnancy that occurs in a female participant . If a female 
partner becomes pregnant, the Investigator will request  consent from the partner to collect this 
information.  
9.5.3.  Pregnancy Follow -Up 
The pregnancy will be followed -up to determine the outcome (spontaneous miscarriage, elective 
termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality)  and should include an 
assessment of the possible relationship to the study treatment o f any pregnancy outcome. This 
information should  also be documented  on the Pregnancy Outcome  Form and reported to the 
Sponsor.

 10. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOU RCE DATA/DOCUMENTATI ON 
Participant s will be identified on CRFs by a unique participant  identification numb er and on 
source documents by name and date of birth. No personal identifier will be used in any 
publication or communication used to support this research study. The participant  identification 
number will be used if it becomes necessary to identify data s pecific to a single participant .  
The local IRB, FDA , the monitors, auditors and personnel authorized by the Sponsor are eligible 
to review  the medical and research records related to this study as part of their responsibility to 
protect human participant s in clinical research . They  will be given direct access to source data 
and documentation (e.g., medical charts/records, printouts etc.) for source data verification, 
provided that participant  confidentiality is maintained in accordance with local requireme nts. 
Access to electronic medical records may be governed by institution policy . Each site will be 
required to ensure access while remaining compliant with institutional requirements.

 11. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
11.1. MONITORING REQUIREMENTS  
The specific obligations outlined in 21 Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) and ICH guidelines 
require  the Sponsor to maintain current personal knowl edge of the progress of a study. Therefore,  
the Sponsor's designated monitor will vis it the site  during the study as well as maintain frequent 
telephone and written communication. The Investigator will permit the Sponsor to monitor the 
study as frequently as is deemed necessary and provide access to medical records to ensure that 
data are being recorded adequately, that data are verifiable and that protocol adherence is 
satisfactory.  
As delineated above, t he Investigator will permit representatives of the Sponsor and/or 
designated CRO to inspect all CRFs and corresponding study participant  original medical 
records (sourc e documents) at regular intervals throughout the study. Participant  original medical 
records and other relevant data must be available to support all data recorded in the CRF. In 
addition to the original medical records, these data may include but are not limited to  study, 
laboratory reports, etc.  
In accordance with federal regulations, s ite inspections will serve to verify strict adherence to the 
protocol and the accuracy of the data that is being e ntered on the case report forms . A 
Monitoring Log will be  maintained at each study site . The Monitoring Log  will be signed by the 
monitor , date d and state d the type of visit. The Investigator should be aware that the study site 
and participant  records may be inspected by the Sponsor and or representatives of the  designated 
CRO, FDA or other regional regulatory authority.  
11.2. ACCEPTABILITY O F CASE REPORT FORMS (CRF S) 
For each participant  who has signed an informed consent form, a CRF  must be completed. For 
participant s who are screen failures, this would be limited to  the screen failure CRF page. All 
source documents and CRFs will be completed as soon as pos sible after the participant 's visit and 
corrections to data on the CRFs will be documented , if applicable . The Investigator will review 
the CRFs to indicate that, t o his/her knowledge, they are complete and accurate. CRFs will be 
reviewed by the Sponsor’s or designated CRO’s monitor, who will make a decision as to their 
acceptability.   
11.3. MODIFICATION O F PROTOCOL  
The Investigator will not modify or alter this protocol w ithout first o btaining the concurrence of 
the Sponsor. Approval by the Investigator’s IRB must also be obtained prior to implementation 
of the change, with two exceptions:  
1. When necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to the participant ; or 
  SNS812CLCT01  
                                                                                                   V4.1

CONFIDENTIAL      Page 79 of 94 
 2. When th e modification does not involve the participant ’s participation in the study . 
An amendment may also require modification of the informed consent form. The Investigator 
will provide an approval letter for the amendment and revised informed consent form, if 
applicable, to the Sponsor. An amendment must be provided in writing and it must be dated by 
both the Sponsor and the Investigator. If necessary, the Sponsor will submit protocol 
amendments to FDA and other appropriate regulatory authorities and notify oth er Investigators 
using this protocol.  
11.4. REPORTING PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
The Investigator is obligated to follow the protocol without departure from the requirements 
written in the protocol. If the Investigator deviates from the protocol requirements, the Spons or 
will make the determination as to whether the participant  will continue in the study. The Sponsor 
also has the right to discontinue the participant  for protocol violations. The IRB may also have to 
be contacted if safety to the participant  or if the sci entific soundness of the study is involved. All 
protocol deviations must be documented in the CRFs.  
11.4.1.  Major Protocol Deviation or Violation  
A major protocol deviation or violation is a deviation from the IRB approved protocol that may 
affect the participant 's rights, safety, or well-being  and/or the completeness, accuracy,  and 
reliability of the study data.  Examples of this include:  
 Failure to obtain informed consent prior to initiation of study -related procedures  
 A research participant  does not meet the pro tocol's eligibility criteria but was enrolled 
without prior approval from the sponsor.  
 A research participant  received the wrong treatment or incorrect dose.  
 A research participant  met withdrawal criteria during the study but was not withdrawn.  
 A research participant  received a  prohibited  concomitant medication.  
 Failure to treat research participant s per protocol procedures that specifically relat e to 
primary efficacy outcomes.  
 Changing the protocol without prior  sponsor and  IRB approval.  
 Multiple minor vio lations of the same nature after multiple warnings.  
11.4.2.   Minor Protocol Deviation or Violation  
A minor protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or 
procedures of a research protocol that has not been approved by the IRB a nd which DOES NOT 
have a major impact on the participant 's rights, safety or well -being, or the completeness, 
accuracy and reliability of the study data.  Examples of this include:

 13. DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING  
13.1. RECORDING AND COLLECTION OF DATA 
The primary source document for this study will be the participant 's medical record. If separate 
research records are maintained by the Investigator(s), the medical record and the research 
records will be considered the sou rce documents for the purposes of auditing the study.  
Applicable source data will be manually transcribed to approve  case report forms (CRF). The 
Investigator is ultimately responsible for the accuracy of the data transcribed on the forms. All 
source docu ments and CRFs will be completed as soon as possible after the participant 's visit.  
The Investigator will review the CRFs to indicate that, to his/her knowledge, they are complete 
and accurate. Designated source documents will be signed and dated by the ap propriate study 
personnel. The Investigator must agree to complete and maintain source documents and CRFs 
for each participant  participating in the study.  
All research data will be entered, either electronically or manually, into a computerized database. 
The clinical database will be designed by the clinical data manager in accordance with 21  CFR 
Part 11 and based on protocol requirements defined by the Sponsor in association with the Lead 
Investigator.  
The Investigator will maintain a confidential list of  study participant s that will include each 
participant ’s study number, name, date of birth, and unique hospital identification number if 
applicable. This list will be kept by the Investigator and will not be collected by the Sponsor. A 
notation will be mad e in the participant ’s case history/medical chart that he/she is participating in 
a clinical study and has provided a signed and dated ICF as well as a release for protected health 
information as required by local policies. The Investigator must also maint ain a separate 
screening log of all the participant s screened for participation in the study; it should include 
gender, age, eligibility status,  reason for ineligibility, if applicable; and study allocated 
participant  number, if applicable.  
13.2. CLINICAL DATA MANAGEMENT  
The Sponsor and/or designated CRO will be responsible for the processing and quality control of 
the data. Data management will be carried out as described in the Sponsor’s or CRO’s standard 
operating procedures (SOPs) for clinical studies.  
The h andling of data, including data quality control, will comply with regulatory guidelines 
(e.g.,  ICH E6 GCP, and local regulations where applicable) and the Sponsor’s or the CRO’s 
SOPs as well as provisions of the study -specific Data Management Plan.

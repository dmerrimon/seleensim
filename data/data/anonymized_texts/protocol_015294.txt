pendix following this Protocol) . 
 
Follow -up 
- Blood tests which include a comprehensive metabolic  panel  (includes liver function and chemistry 
panel) , protime  and complete blood count will be drawn at the subject’s 1 -4 week fol low-up visit with 
their surgeon.   These tests will be performed by a certified diagnostic laboratory such as DLS.   If 
subject agrees, an optional research blood sample will also be collected  and sent to UHCC for ana l-
ysis.  
-Subjects are also  enrolled int o the Hawaii Tumor Registry.  Therefore, the  ORD staff will not be 
involved in extended follow -up data collection, given that this falls within the scop e the State -
mandated tumor registry a ctivities . 
 
I.2. Criteria for Patient Selection  
Inclusion Criteria: Inclusion Criteria:  1) > 18 years of age.  No upper limit of age. 2) liver tumor diagnosed 
histological ly as HCC or suspected of being HCC in association with serum alpha -fetoprotein  level > 200 or

Program Director/Principal Investigator (La st, First, Middle ): Kwee, Sandi Alexander  
 I.4. Method of Enrollment and Follow -up 
Written informed consent will be obtained by the PI or other physician listed on FDA Form  1572 .   The R e-
search Nurse (Karen Ng or other ORD nurse) or Associate (Miles Sato or other ORD Associate)  will assist the 
PI with recruitment, enrol lment, scheduling, and follow -up.     
 If the subject experiences a serious adverse event, follow -up of the  adverse event to its conclusion will ult i-
mately be the responsibility of the PI and the IND sponsor -investigator (who serves as co -investigator on this 
study).  The patient’s treating physician will be a llowed to assist with clinical follow -up.   
 
I.4.1. Authenticating Disease Progression  
Clinical information (test results, etc.) will be reviewed for the purpose of confirming inclusion/exclusion cr iteria.   
  Evidence of disease progression will be collected and made available for descriptive purposes and r etrospe c-
tive analyses.  Data collection to support authentication of disease progression will include documentation of 
patient demographics, age, perf ormance status, clinical stage , details and dates of the pr imary therapy, and 
post-treatment clinical stat us.  The presence of p otential disease sites will be documented based on reports of 
any available imaging studies including but not limited to CT, MRI, ultrasound, and bone scan.  This data will 
be assembled on study specific forms by the personnel for thi s study.  The PET image data and genomics data 
are high -dimensional datasets.  This type of data will not be available in study forms but will remain in their 
source format.  The survival data will also not be collected by study personnel or entered into t he study specific 
forms, since they will be obtained directly from the Hawaii Tumor Registry through query reports.   
 
 
I.5. Method for Determining Doses, Maximum dosage, and Duration of Patient Drug Exposure  
Patient dose has been determined by the least radiation dose from the radiopharmaceutical that will provide 
enough counts in the tomograph detectors to obtain quantifiable images with adequate counting statistics.  The 
exposure of the patient to the radiopharmaceutical will only be until the radioacti ve label decays.  The half life 
of fluorine -18 is 109.8 mi nutes.  Maximum duration of radiation exposure is therefore limited by this half -life.  
The number of doses administered is determined by the number of PET/CT scans required by the study prot o-
col.  The total effective dose will not exceed reasonably safe limits set by the FDA  as described in the invest i-
gator’s brochure for 18F -choline .  Each dose of 18F -choline is administered intravenously as a single unit 
dose. A radioactivity dose of 0.0 9 milliCur ies per kilogram of body weight will be prescribed and obtained from 
the cyclotron laboratory.  A dose calibrator in the PET imaging suite will be used to co nfirm the actual dose to 
be administered.  Only a dose falling within a 10% range of the calculated  prescribed dose will be admini s-
tered.   
I.6. Observations and Measurements to Fulfill the Objectives of the Study  
Source documents (clinical, radiographic, and pathology reports), obtained from the medical record (office or 
hospital) following subject wri tten informed consent, will be abstracted to generate a list of known sites of a c-
tive disease.  A table of these sites for each subject will be entered into a password -protected database.   
 
I.7 Investigational Observations and Measurements to Fulfill the Objectives of the Study  
The 18F - Choline injection is infused into the subject intravenously over 1 minute.  The PET scanning is started 
approximately 10 minutes after the start of infusion.  PET imaging data, from the neck to the proximal femur is 
then co llected.  PET data is analyzed by: a) visual assessment, and b) semi -quantitative region of interest 
(ROI) analysis.  Standardized uptake values (SUV) will be recorded from each ROI.  Implicit in the definition of 
SUV is the requirement that the tomograph be properly calibrated so that activity in tissue can be determined in 
uCi/ml.  Structural imaging (CT, MRI) when available will be used for anatomical correlation. If a PET/CT scan 
is performed, the CT performed for attenuation correction will provide som e anatomical correlation data.  The 
PET/CT imaging protocol is described in section I.10.  
 
Patients will routinely schedule  follow -up visits with their surgeons at 1 -4 weeks post -op.  After  this vis it, the 
Program Director/Principal Investigator (La st, First, Middle ): Kwee, Sandi Alexander  
 study will perform blood tests which include a co mplete blood count , protime  and comprehensive metabolic  
panel  (CMP) .  These tests will be provided through a commercial testing laboratory (eg. Diagnostic Laboratory 
Services, Inc.).  The results of these clinical laboratory test results will be compared t o the pre -operative PET 
imaging findings to investigate  whether PET may be predictive of post -surgery liver function.  This is consistent 
with Specific Aim 3 of the r esearch study.   
If the research subject agrees, additional  research blood sample s will be obtained  immediately before and 1 -4 
week following  liver resection surgery . These samples will be sent to UHCC for analysis.  If the patient is having 
other blood tests, these sample s can be collected with the  other tests.  Using sterile technique, an intra venous 
needle will be inserted by a trained IV technician into an arm vein. A  total of a pproximately 4 tsp of blood will 
be withdrawn into two vacutainer tube s.  The sample  centrifuged to isolate plasma fraction, buffy coat, and pe l-
let.  These samples will  be frozen and analyzed in batches later to provide data on germline DNA, RNA, mi-
croRNA, and circulating RNA/DNA.  The same proc edure will be applied to the pre -surgery and post -surgery 
sample collections. If the results of a recent (within 3 months) fasting lipid profile ( ie. cholesterol  blood test ) are 
not available,  a fasting lipid profile will be obtained  by Diagnostic Laboratory Services at the time other bas e-
line laboratory samples  are being obtained by the study .  This information will be compared wi th the PET ima g-
ing and tissue expression data , providing reference values for the genomic analyses (Specific Aim 2) .  These 
blood sa mples will be used only to pursue the goals of this study, and will not be stored and made available to 
other research studi es. 
 
I.8. Clinical Procedures or other Measures to Monitor the Effects of the Drug in Human Subjects  
Vital signs (e.g., temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate) will be measured on each subject 
prior to radiotracer administration.  Vital  signs will be repeated at the conclusion of PET imaging.  During and 
after the PET/CT scanning procedure, subjects will be asked if they are experiencing any unusual symptoms.   
 
I.9. Policy regarding human subjects and informed consent  
Research involving  human subjects is covered by federal law and institutional policies.  All research conducted 
at our institution requires review and pre -approval by a Scientific Review Committee followed by approval from 
an Institutional Review Board.  Subjects will be gi ven a Queen’s Medical Center IRB -approved consent.   
 
I.10. PET/CT Protocol  
 
Instrument:  Gemini TF -64 PET/CT (Philips Medical Systems N.A., Bothell, WA)  
Scan Protocol:  Low-Dose CT, Liver  PET Protocol  
Isotope Dose:  18F-Fluoromethylcholine, 0.09 mCi/kg  patie nt body weight on day of scan.  
 
1. A copy of the signed consent form will be faxed to the Research Regulatory Office.  
2.  Height, sex, and age of the patient are recorded.  Body weight, blood pressure, pulse, temperature and re s-
piratory rate are obtained.  The obtained weight is used to determine 18F -choline dose.  
3.  Using sterile technique, an intravenous catheter is inserted by a trained IV technician into an arm vein.  The 
catheters are flushed with sterile saline.  The patient is placed in the supine p osition on the scanning table.  
4.  A vial of 18F -choline containing a dose of 0.0 9 mCi/kg of body weight will be obtained from the cyclotron 
laboratory.   A dose calibrator in the PET imaging suite will be used to confirm the actual administration 
dose.  O nly a dose falling within a 10% range of the calculated prescribed dose will be admini stered.   
5. A topographic scan will be performed to identify anatomical boundaries and the axial imaging field of view. 
The field of view is to encompass the liver, with  1cm margin from the upper limit of the field.  
6.  A CT transmission scan in the supine position is acquired over the upper abdomen .  The 64 -channel helical 
CT scanning parameters were: 120 kV, 30 -50 mA/slice, rotation time 0.75 sec, slice thickness/inter val 
5.0mm.  No intr avenous contrast will be used with CT.   
7.  The 18F -choline is injected by bolus followed by a 10 cc  saline flush.  Image acquisition is begun immed i-
Program Director/Principal Investigator (La st, First, Middle ): Kwee, Sandi Alexander  
 ately with the flush in a dynamic mode using the following timing schema:   
Frame #  Duration (seconds)  
1-20 10 
21-23 40 
24-27 120 
28-30 240 
31 360 
However, if it is determined in the initial 5 subjects that the dynamic imaging data fits well into a 1 -tissue kinetic 
model of FCH uptake where activity levels eventually plateau or become linear, then the dynamic scan can 
be shortened (to 12 -15 minutes, for example) and the dynamic frames curtailed accordingly.  
 
8.  A short 3 -minute static scan of the liver will be performed subsequent to the dynamic scan, and rapidly r e-
constucted to provid e the investigators an immediate image for review of quality control and biodistribution.   
The operating characteristics of this PET device are described elsewhere (Surti S, et al. J Nucl Med. 
2007;48(3):471 -480. )  
9.  After the scan, patient blood pressu re, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature are measured a recorded.  
Subjects are released pending investigator review of the vital signs and flow sheet.  
10. Image reconstruction will employ a list -mode version of a maximum likelihood expectation maximiz ation 
algorithm with a time -of-flight kernel applied in both the forward - and back -projection operations.  CT data 
is used for attenuation correction.  Reconstructed images in 3 orthogonal planes will be reviewed on a de d-
icated PET/CT viewing station and w ill be archived on removable media in DICOM format.  
 
I.11. Facilities Data  
The facilities used to carry out the activities described in this document are located at the Queen’s Medical 
Center, 1301 Punchbowl St., Honolulu, HI 96818.  These facilities incl ude the Hamamatsu/Queen’s PET Ima g-
ing Center which houses the tomograph, and the Liholiho Cyclotron Building which houses the accelerator.  
The accelerator used to produce radioisotopes is an 11 MeV RDS -111 (CTI, Knoxville, TN)  with the required 
beam line and targetry systems.  The radiochemistry laboratories house production systems and robotics, a 
pneumatic system for transfer of radiopharmaceutical to the imaging area, and adequate equipment and labo r-
atory space for radiopharmaceutical production and qua lity control.  The hot lab contains 2 hot cells (Von 
Gahlen, Netherlands), organic chemistry space for compound production and development, and a small radi o-
pharmacy in the imaging suite.  There is 110 square feet of radioanalytical instrumentation and des k space for 
radiochemistry work.   
Handling of all radioisotopes is conducted under the supervision of the hospital Radiation Safety Office 
(RSO).  RSO personnel will regularly monitor the radiopharmaceutical laboratories for radioisotope contamin a-
tion.  A ll personnel using radioisotopes will wear a film badge and those handling isotopes will wear finger ring 
badges to monitor integrated radiation absorbed dose.  Disposal of radioactive waste is only in specially desi g-
nated and properly shielded receptacles .  The laboratory is monitored for radioactivity by external monitoring 
and wipe tests.  The short half -life of fluorine -18 insures that no long -term radiation safety problem is enge n-
dered.  All equipment is tested regularly as to its operation.  Specifica lly, the dose calibrator is tested for co n-
stancy each day it is used, its linearity quarterly, and its accuracy annually.  Logbooks record these measur e-
ments.  Radiation survey instruments, including safety monitors (hand and foot) and personal dosimeters,  are 
calibrated at least annually and following any repairs.  All calibration procedures and schedules for radiation 
monitoring devices are reviewed and approved by the RSO.  The PET imaging facilities are located in the first 
floor of Queen’s Medical Cent er, adjacent to the Nuclear Medicine clinic.  This area houses the PET/CT d e-
vice.  There are existing waiting rooms and patient examination facilities in the clinic and physician and nursing 
personnel are available on premises.  The rooms of the PET suite are the 1) two tomograph rooms, one co n-
taining a Hamamatsu SHR -22000 PET system, and another containing a Philips Gemini TF PET/CT scanner 
with 64 -slice CT, 2) a control room with a small radiopharmacy laboratory, 3) the administration and patient 
holding room, and the 4) a data analysis and display room located in the Nuclear Medicine clinic.

Protocol 
Amendment 0422-Sep -2023The purpose of this protocol amendment is to formally incorporate 
guidance provided in the “Dear Investigator” letters from 27
-Jul-2023 and 
10-Aug -2023, and further clarify participant management and study 
procedures as the study proceeds toward termination due to one of the 
primary  efficacy endpoints not meeting the success criterion and the 
implausibility of success of the other primary endpoint. The decision to 
terminate the study was not based on any safety  concerns or issues. On 
26-Jul -2023 the study independent Data Moni toring Committee convened. 
Based on a clinical data cutoff of 01 -Jun-2023, the addition of nivolumab 
to docetaxel plus prednisone did not result in a statistically significant 
improvement in radiographic progression -free survival (rPFS) (hazard 
ratio 0.96;99% confidence interval [CI] 0.77, 1.19) at final analy sis and 
overall survival (OS) at the first interim analy sis (hazard ratio 1.09; 
99.41% CI 0.84, 1.43) compared to placebo added to docetaxel plus 
prednisone. A Sponsor Executive Oversight Committee (EOC) requested 
to be unblinded to the study results. Further evaluation of OS results 
showed no plausible scenario of reaching OS statistical significance at 
subsequent, planned statistical analy ses, including the second interim 
analy sis and final analy sis. Given the lack of clinical benefit from 
nivolumab added to docetaxel plus prednisone for the dual primary 
efficacy endpoints of rPFS and OS, the Sponsor EOC decided to terminate 
the study. Unblinding of study treatment assignment to full study teams 
and i nvestigato rs occurred on 03 -Aug -2023.

Protocol Summary
Section 3.1: Overall 
Rationale for Protocol 
Amendment 0 4and Study 
TerminationAdded the following text:
“Per Protocol Amendment 0 4, the independent Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC) convened on 26 -Jul-2023 
for a prespecified review of all available study data based 
on a clinical data cutoff of 01 -Jun-2023 . After reviewing 
the final analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint of 
radiographic progression -free survival (rPFS) per Blinded 
Independent Central Review (BICR) and the first interim 
analy sis of the primary efficacy endpoint of overall 
survival (OS), the DMC agreed that the study did not meet 
the prespecified boundaries for declaring statistical 
significance for either endpoint. Although the number of 
events for OS at the second interim analysis and final 
analy sis of OS had not been attained, based on the first 
interim analysis results for OS, the DMC determined that 
the prespecified boundaries for declaring significance were 
unlike ly to be met. No new safety concerns were 
identified. ASponsor Executive Oversight Committee 
(EOC) requested to be unblinded to the study results and 
decided to terminate the study. F ull study  teams and 
investigators were unblinded to study treatment 
assignment on 03-Aug-2023 .Provide an 
explanatio n for study

Section 5.1.2: Treatment 
PhaseClarified that decisions on docetaxel treatment will be 
based on the clinical judgment of the treating physician 
and o n shared decision making with t he participant. 
Participants who are not able to access local therapy may 
continue on study -provided docetaxel until local access is 
available. In the event that the investigator deems a 
participant is deriving clinical benefit from nivolumab 
therapy  and, together with the counseled participant, 
wishes to continue treatment, this may be possible 
following discussion with the Medical Monitor to ensure a 
clinical rationale exists that justifies continuation of 
nivolumab treatment. Ensure that 
participants cu rrently 
receiving study -
provided docetaxel 
do not undergo 
treatment 
interruptions.

Clinical Protocol CA2097DX
BMS -936558 nivolumab
1 SYNOPSIS
Protocol Title: A Phase 3 Randomized, Double -Blind Study of Nivolumab or Placebo in 
Combination with Docetaxel, in Men with Metastatic Castration -resistant Prostate Cancer 
(CheckMate 7DX: CHECKpoint pathway and nivoluMAb clinical Trial Evaluation 7DX)
Short Title:
A Study  of Nivo lumab or Placebo in Combinatio n with Docetaxel  in Men with Metastati c 
Castrati on-resist ant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
Study Phase: 3
Rationale:
Prostate cancer tumor cells have been shown to have low tum or expressio n of programmed deat h 
ligand -1 (PD-L1), suggesting that treatm ents directed at the programmed death -1 (PD1 )/PD-L1 
interact ion are unlikely to be successful as monotherapi es.1This was confirmed by early clinical 
trials, where unselected men with mCRPC did not respond to PD-1 blockade as monotherapy .2
However, several studi es show that PD-L1 expressio n can be up-regul ated in response to 
inflammatory  cytokines, a phenom enon which has been term ed “adapt iveimmune resistance .3,4,5
This suggests that if prostate cancer treatments (ie, chemotherapy, androgen ablat ion) can increase 
PD-L1 expressio n on tumor cells by attracting infiltrating immune cells and triggering an adaptive 
immune response, there is a rationale for combining such therapies with immune check -point 
inhibitors .6,7,8,9The rationale for combining chem otherapy  and immunotherapy  is based on the 
findings that cytotoxi c treatm ents such as chem otherapy  may modulate tumor/immune -system 
interact ions i
n favor of the immune system . Chemotherapy  can resul t in tumor cell  death as part 
of its intended therapeut ic effect with a resul tant increase in tumor antigen delivery to antigen -
present ing cells.
These findings have led to the development of clinical trials evaluating the combinat ion of 
docetaxel and PD1/PDL1 inhibitors which has shown promising act ivity in pat ients with mCRPC 
previously treated with second -generati on hormonal therapi es as described in Rationale for 
Popul ation Section of the Protocol.
NCC N guidelines reco mmend to use docetaxel (category 1) as the preferred 1st line chemotherap y 
in men with symptom atic mCRPC and in patients with signs of rapid progressi on or viscera l 
metastases despite lack of  symptoms. In addi tion, docetaxel has a category 1 recommendat ion in 
second -line after prior enzalutamide/abiraterone .
The current study  aims to demonstrate that treatm ent with docetaxel  in combinat ion with 
nivolumab will be efficaci ous in participants with mCRPC. Addit ional object ives of the study 
include characteri zation of safety and tolerabili ty, as well as pharmacokinet ics,  
 and changes in patient reported outcomes for qualit y of life assessments.
Per Protocol Amendment 04, the independent Data Monitoring Committee (D MC) convened 
on 26-Jul- 2023 for a prespecified review of all available study data based on a clinical data

cutoff of 01 -Jun-2023 . After reviewing the final analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint of 
radiographic progression -free survival (rPFS) per Blinded Independent Central Review 
(BICR) and the first interim analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint of overall survival 
(OS), the DMC agreed that the study did not meet the prespecified boundaries for declaring 
statistical significance for either endpoint . Although the number of events for OS at the 
second interim analysis and final analysis of OS had not been attained, based on the first 
interim analysis results for OS, the DMC determined that the prespecified boundaries for 
declaring significance were unlikely to be met. No new safety concerns were identified. A
Sponsor Executive Oversight Committee (EOC) requested to be unblinded to the study 
results and decided to terminate the study. Full study teams and investigators were 
unblinded to study treatmen t assignment on 03 -Aug-2023.
Protocol Amendment 04 reflects changes in study conduct. For participants who are deemed 
appropriate to continue on nivolumab or docetaxel therapy through the CA2097DX study, 
re-consent will be required.
Study Population:
Male participants ages 18 or local age of maj ority.
Key Inclusion Criteria:
Histologic confirmat ion of adenocarcino ma of the prostate. Diagnosis must be stated in a 
pathol ogy report and confirmed by  the investi gator
Current evidence of metastatic disease docum ented by eit her bone lesio ns on radionuclide bone 
scan and/or soft tissue lesio ns on CT/MRI. Metastases may be in regional lymph nodes (N1 
per AJCC staging criteria, 8th edition) and/or distant metastases (M1 perAJCC staging criteria, 
8th edit ion). 
Parti cipants whose disease spread is limited to regional pelvic lymph nodes (N1) measuring 
at least 2 cm  in short axi s will be considered eligible.
Ongo ing ADT with a
 gonadotropi n-releasing horm one (GnRH) analogue or bilateral 
orchi ectomy  (ie, surgical or medical castration) confirm ed by  testosterone level ≤ 1.73 nmol/L 
(50 ng/dL) at the screening visit. Castrate levels of testosterone must be maintained by surgica l 
or medical means (luteinizing horm one-releasing horm one [LHRH]/ GnRH analogues) 
throughout the conduct of the study. For participant s who have not had an orchiectomy , this 
therapy  must have been initiated at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of study treatm ent and 
treatm ent m ust be continued throughout the s tudy
Docum ented prostate cancer progressi on as per PCWG3 criteria within 6 months prior to 
screening with at least one of the fo llowing:
PSA progressi on defined by a minimum of 2 rising PSA levels with an interval of1week 
between each determinat ion. The PSA value at the screening visit shoul d be 2μg/L (2 
ng/mL).
Note: Participants who received an anti-androgen must have PSA progression after 
withdrawal (4weeks since last flutamide administrati on or6 weeks since last 
bicalutamide or nilutamide administration)

Key Exclusion Criteria:
Medical Conditions:
Parti cipants with active brain metastases. Participants with brain metastases are eligible to 
enroll in this study  if brain metastases have been treated and there is no magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI except where contraindicated in which case CT scan is acceptable) ev idence of 
progression for at least 4 weeks after treatm ent is complete and within 28 days prior to first 
dose of study drug administration. Such cases shoul d be discussed with the BMS Medical 
Moni tor or designee . Previously irradiated brain lesio ns are not considered measurable disease .
Parti cipants must have recovered from the effects of major surgery  requiring general  anesthesia 
or significant traumat ic injury  at least 14 days befo re start of study  treatm ent.

recovered (ie, Grade 1 or at baseline) from radiatio n-related toxi cities.
All toxicities attributed to pri or anti -cancer therapy  other than al opecia and fatigue must have 
resolved to Grade 1 or baseline before administration of study treatment. Participants with 
toxicities attributed to prior anti -cancer therapy  that are not expected to res olve and resul t in 
long-lasting sequelae, such as peripheral  neuropathy  after platinum based therapy , are 
permitted to e nroll. Parti cipants who have Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy  are excluded.
Parti cipants wi th an act ive, known, or suspected autoimmune disease. Participants with ty pe I 
diabetes mellitus, hypothy roidism  only requi ring horm one replacement, skin disorders (such 
as vit iligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment, or condit ions not expected 
to recur i n the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll.
Parti cipants who have received a live / attenuated vaccine within 30 days of first dose in the 
study .
Dem entia, altered mental  status, or any psychiatri c condi tion that woul d prohibit the 
understanding or rendering o f informed consent or completing QoL questionnaire.

immunodeficiency  syndrom e (AIDS). NOTE: Testing for HIV must be perform ed at all sites 
in Germany and where mandated locally. (see Appendix 9) .
Parti cipants with serious or uncontrolled medical disorders that, in the opinio n of the
investigator, would impair the abilit y of the parti cipant to receive protocol  therapy or obscure 
the interpretation of AEs, such as a condit ion associated with frequent diarrhea.
Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infect ion, 
history  of congest ive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhyt hmia, or psychiatric 
illness/social situat ions that woul d limit co mpliance wi th study  requi rements. Addit ionally , in 
the case of prior severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2)infect ion, 
acute symptoms must have resolved and based on investigator assessment in consultat ion with 
the Medical Monitor, there are no sequelae that would place the participant at a higher risk of 
receiving invest igational treatment (see Section 6.4.1) .

Objectives and Endpoints:
Objective Endpoint
Primary
To compare the rPFS (using PCWG3) of 
nivolumab in combination with docetaxel 
to placebo in combination with docetaxel, 
inmen with metastatic castration -resistant 
prostate cancer (mCRPC).rPFS for randomized participants is the time between 
randomization and the first date of documented progression 
or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. The 
radiographic progr ession will be assessed by Blinded 
Independent Central Review (BICR) per PCWG3 . The 
rPFS will be censored at the last tumor assessment up to the 
start of subsequent systemic cancer therapy.

Objective Endpoint
To compare the OS of nivolumab in 
combinatio n with docetaxel to placebo in 
combinatio n with docetaxel inmen with 
metastatic castration -resistant prostate 
cancer (mCRPC) .OS for all randomized participants is the time between 
randomization and the date of death from any cause. For 
participants who are alive, their survival time will be 
censored at the last date that they  were known to be alive. 
OS will be censored for participants at the date of 
randomization if they had no follow -up. 
Secondary
To assess the antitumor activity  of 
nivolumab in combination with docetaxel .Objective Response Rate per PCWG3 (ORR -PCWG3) is 
the proportion of participants who have a confirmed 
complete or partial best overall response (BOR) per 
PCWG3 among randomized participants who have 
measurable disease at baseline. The BOR is defined as the 
best response designation, as determined by the BICR, 
recorded between the date of randomization and the date of 
objectively documented progression per PCWG3 or the date 
of subsequent systemic cancer therapy , whichever occurs 
first. For partici pants without documented progr ession or 
subsequent systemic cancer therapy , all available response 
assessments will contribute to the BOR assessment.
Time to Response per PCWG3 (TTR -PCWG3) is the time 
from randomization to the date of the first documented CR 
or PR per PCWG3, as determined by BICR. 
Duration of Response per PCWG3 (DOR -PCWG3) is the 
time between the date of first response (CR/PR per 
PCWG3) tothe date of first documented radiographic 
progression per PCWG3, as determined by  BICR, or death 
due to any  cause. Participants who neither progress nor die 
will be censored at the last tumor assessment up to the start 
of subsequent systemic cancer therapy.
PSA Response Rate (PSA -RR) is the proportion of 
randomized participants with a 50% or greater decre ase in 
PSA from baseline to the lowest post-baseline PSA result. 
A second consecutive value obtained 3 or more weeks later 
is required to confirm the PSA response. PSA response will 
be calculated for all participants with PSA values at baseline 
and at least one post -baseline assessment.
Time to PSA Progression (TTP -PSA) is the time between 
randomization to the date of PSA progression per PCWG3 
in randomized participants. For participants with an initial 
PSA decline from baseline, the date of PSA progr ession is 
the date that an increase of 25% or more and an absolute 
increase of 2 ng/mL or more from the nadir are documented 
and confirmed by a second consecutive PSA value at least 
3 weeks later. For participants with no PSA decline from 
baseline, the date of PSA progression is the date that an 
increase of 25% or more and an absolute increase of 2 
ng/mL or more from baseline are documented beyond Week 
13. TTP-PSA will be censored at the date of last PSA 
evaluation prior to the start of subsequent systemic cancer
therapy . The time will be censored at the date of

Overall Design:
CA2097DX is a Phase 3 randomized, double -blinded, multi-center clinical trial comparing 
nivolumab or pl acebo in combinat ion with docetaxel, in men with metastati c castrati on-resistant 
prostate cancer.
Randomization will be stratified according to the foll owing baseline factors:
1 prior Novel  Antiandrogen Therapy (NAT) for mCRPC vs 1 prior NAT for non-metastati c 
castration -resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) or metastatic castrati on-sensi tive prostate 
cancer (mCSPC) vs 2 prior NAT
Visceral  disease (Y vs N)
Visceral  disease status will be assessed by invest igator based on the tum or assessment perform ed 
during screening. Visceral disease is defined as the presence of metastatic disease in the liver, lung, 
adrenal, peritoneum, brain or other internal organs. Bone,lymph node metastases and prostate 
lesion (or bladder/rectum if fro m direct invasion from prostate) are not considered visceral disease .

Figure 1-1: Study Design Schematic
Per Protocol Amendment 0 4, participants assigned to Arm B will no longer receive placebo. 
Per Protocol Amendment 04, decisions on docetaxel treatment will be based on the clinical 
judgment of the treating physician and on shared decision making with the participant. 
Participants who are not able to access local therapy may continue on study -provided 
docetaxel until local access is available. In the event that the investigator deems a participant 
is deriving clinical benefit from nivolumab 
therapy and, together with the counseled 
participant, wishes to continue treatment, this may be possible following discussion with the
Medical Monitor to ensure a clinical rationale exists that justifies continuation of nivolumab 
treatment.
Number of Participants: 
Assum ing a 25% screen failure rate, it is estimated that approximately 1312 participants with 
mCRPC will be enro lled in order to randomize approximately 984 participants .
The sample size determinati on of this study  is based on a comparison of the rPFS and OS 
distribution between participants rando mized to nivolumab in combinat ion with docetaxel and 
participants randomized to placebo in co mbinat ion with docetaxel . 
These endpo ints will be evaluated for treatment effect using the fo llowing testing strategy : 
The analysis for rPFS will occur after enrollment for the study has completed and  
approximately  530 rPFS events are observed in all rando mized global subjects. The number of 
events was estimated assuming an exponent ial distribut ion of rPFS for the Docetaxel arm (Arm 
B) and a piecewise exponent ial distribut ion with a 2-months delayed treatment effect for the 
Nivo lumab + Docetaxel arm (Arm A). This number of events provi des 90% power to de tect 
an average HR of 0.67 (Arm A vs Arm B in all randomized global partic ipants) with a 2 -sided 
alpha of 0.01. The average HR of 0.67 resulted from an assumed targeted hazard ratio of 1 for 
the init ial 2 mo nths fro m rando mization and a targeted hazard ratio of 0.58 for the time beyond 
2 months f rom randomizat ion.
The analysis for OS has two planned interim analyses and a final analysis. The first interim 
analysis will occur at the time of rPFS analysis, the second interim analysis is planned at

approximately  80% of  the total  events, and the final  analysis is planned at approxima tely 690 
events among all rando mized global participants. The number of events was estimated 
assuming an exponent ial distribut ion of OS for the Docetaxel arm (Arm B) and a piecewise 
exponent ial distribut ion with a 3-monthdelayed treatm ent effect for the Nivolumab + 
Docetaxel arm (Arm A). This number of events provides 92% power to detect an average HR 
of 0.76 (Arm  A
 vs Arm B in all randomized partici pants) with a 2-sided alpha of 0.04. The 
average HR of 0.76 resulted fro m an assumed targeted hazard ratio o f 1 fo r the initial 3 mo nths 
from randomizat ion and a targeted hazard ratio of 0.72 for the time beyo nd 3months from 
rando mizat ion.Per Protocol Amendment 04, given the decision to terminate the study 
early, the second interim analysis for OS and final analysis for OS will no longer be 
performed, and the first interim analysis will be considered as final. At the time of study 
closeout, an updated descriptive OS analysis will be provided to report all death events.
The stopping boundaries for OSat the interim and final analyses will be based on the actual 
number of events at the time of the analysis using Lan-DeMets alpha -spending funct ion with 
O’Brien -Fleming boundaries, taking into account any alpha that was passed from the rPFS 
analysis (if a pplicable).
These primary endpoints will be tested separately and if significant, the alpha allocated to each 
endpo int will be recycled to the other endpoint. For example, if rPFS is significant at the 0.01 
level, then 0.01 will be transferred to the OS an alysis for testing at 0.05 level.
Treatment Arms and Duration:
Per Protocol Amendment 04,full study teams and investigators were unblinded tostudy
treatment assignment on 03-AUG - 2023 due to lack of rPFS and OS benefit from nivolumab 
added to docetaxel p lus prednisone compared to placebo added to docetaxel plus prednisone. 
Participants in the placebo arm will discontinue placebo and may be able to continue
docetaxel for up to 10 cycles through the study if the participant is in the combination phase, 
and local access to docetaxel outside the study is not available. In addition, all participants 
should receive standard of care treatment for mCRPC per local guidelines.

3 INTRODUCTION
CA2097DX is a Phase 3, rando mized, global study assessing the efficacy and safet y of nivo lumab 
or nivolumab placebo combined with standard of care docetaxel  chemotherapy , in men with 
metastati c castration -resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed after second -
generat ion horm onal manipulat ion, also known as Novel Ant iandrogen Therap y (NAT ), and have 
not received chemotherapy  for mCRPC. 
The study  aims to dem onstrate that treatment wi th nivo lumab combined with docetaxel improves 
clinical efficacy in terms of overall survival (OS) or radiographic progression -free survival (rPFS), 
when co mpared to docetaxel alone.
A detailed descript ion of the chemistry, ph armacology , efficacy, and safet y of the study treatments 
is provided in the respective Invest igator Brochures (IBs) and package inserts.
3.1 Overall Rationale for Protocol Amendment 0 4 and Study Termination
Theindependent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) convened on 26 -Jul-2023 for a prespecified 
review of all  available study  data based on a clinical  data cutoff of 01-Jun-2023. Af ter reviewing 
the final analys is of the primary efficacy endpo int of radiographic progression -free survival (rPFS) 
per Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) and the first interim analysis of the primar y 
efficacy endpo int of overall survival  (OS), the DMC agreed that the study  did not meet the 
prespecified boundari es for declaring statistical significance for either endpo int. Although the 
number of events for OS at the second interim analysis and final analysis of OS had not been 
attained, based on the first interim analysis resul ts for OS, the DMC determined that the 
prespecified boundaries for declaring significance were unlikely to be met . No new safet y concerns 
were ident ified. ASponsor Execut ive Oversight Committee (EOC) requested to be unblinded to 
the study  resul ts and decided to terminate the study . Full study  team s and investigators were 
unblinded to study  treatment as signment on 
03-AUG -2023.
Protocol  Amendment 04reflects changes in study conduct. For participants who are deemed 
appropriate to continue on nivolumab or docetaxel therapy  through  the CA2097DX study , re-
consent will be required.
3.2 Study Rationale
Prostate c ancer tumor cells have been shown to have low tumor expression of programmed deat h 
ligand -
1 (PD-L1), suggesting that treatm ents directed at the programmed death (PD-1)/PD-L1 
interact ion are unlikely to be successful as monotherapi es.1This was confirmed byearly clinical 
trials, where unselected men with mCRPC did not respond to PD-1 blockade as monotherapy .2
However, several studi es show that PD-L1 expressio n can be up-regul ated in response to 
inflammatory  cytokines, a pheno menon which has been term ed “ada ptive immune resistance”3,4,5
This suggests that if prostate cancer treatments (ie, chemotherapy, androgen ablat ion) can increase 
PD-L1 expressio n on tumor cells by attracting infiltrating immune cells and triggering an adaptive 
immune response, there is arationale for combining such therapies with immune check -point 
inhibitors.6,7,8,9The rationale for combining chem otherapy  and immunotherapy  is based on the 
findings that cytotoxi c treatm ents such as chem otherapy  may modulate tumor/immune -system

interact ions in favor of the immune system . Chemotherapy  can resul t in tumor cell  death as part 
of its intended therapeut ic effect with a resul tant increase in tumor antigen delivery to antigen -
present ing cells.
Tumor cell death may also lead to a reducti on in soluble and membrane -bound factors inhibi ting 
tumor-infiltrat ing T -cells and disrupt immune system regulatory networks by decreasing numbers 
of T-regul atory  cells. Docetaxel has been reported to increase the production o f pro -inflammatory 
cytokines which may e nhance the immune response. These findings have led to the devel opment 
of several clinical  trials evaluat ing the combinati on of docetaxel  and PD1/PDL1 inhibitors 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], NCT 03834506, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ).10Preliminary results fro m Keynote -36510have 
demonstrated promising act ivity with this co mbination in patients with mCRPC previously treated 
with NAT(s) as described in Section 5.5.1 (Rationale for Populat ion).
The current study  aims to demonstrate that treatm ent with docetaxel  in combinat ion with 
nivolumab will be efficaci ous in participants with mCRPC. Addit ional object ives of the study 
include characteri zation of safety and tolerabili ty, as well as pharmacokinet ics,  
 and changes in patient reported outcomes for qua lity of life assessments.
3.2.1 Research Hypothesis
1)The administration of nivolumab in combinat ion withdocetaxel  will improve radiographic 
progression -free survival (PFS) assessed by BICR compared with docetaxel  in participants
with mCRPC
2)The administration of nivolumab in co
mbinat ion with docetaxel  will improve overall survival 
(OS) com pared wi th docetaxel  in participants wi th mCRPC
3.3 Background
3.3.1 Background Indication and Treatment Landscape
Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortalit y in men worldwide,11with an estimated 
incidence of 1,276,106 new cases and 358,989 deaths globally12and 164,690 new cases and 
29,430 deaths in US in 2018.13Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and second 
most frequent cause of cancer deaths in US males. In the US, prostate cancer accounted for almost  
1 in 5 new diagnoses of cancer in men in 2018. In Europe, prostate cancer was the most comm on 
primary  sites in men in 2018 (21.8% of the total), with 450,000 new cases and 107,000 deaths 
from prostate can cer being reported in that y ear.14
In 1941, Huggins and Hodges first noted the beneficial effects of castrati on and inject ion of 
estrogens in participants wi th metastatic prostate cancer. Over time, androgen deprivation therap y 
(ADT), defined as medical castrat ion when it is administered as neoadj uvant, concomitant or 
adjuvant therapy  in combinat ion with radiation, became the cornerstone of treatm ent for patients 
with metastatic disease, as well as for patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancers . 
ADT resul ts in disease remissio n in 90% of  metastati c prostate cancer parti cipants, evi denced by 
a decline in levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Nevertheless, most participants become

resistant, with disease progression occurring within a median of 18 to 24 months of continuous 
horm onal manipulat ion.
In 1996, mitoxantrone plus prednisone was approved for the treatm ent of patients with mCRPC 
based on improvement in pain palliat ion.Docetaxel became the first chemotherapeutic agent to 
show an OS benefit in mCRPC in two randomized controlled clinical trials (TAX 32715and 
SWOG 99-1616), and was approved in combinat ion with prednisone for this indicat ion in the US 
in 2004. Since 2010, 6 new therapeut ic agents wit h diverse mechanisms o f action have been a dded 
to the therapeuti c armamentari um, 5 of which (sipuleucel -T, cabazitaxel, abiraterone, 
enzalutamide, and radium-223) have been approved for the treatm ent of mCRPC based on 
improvement in median overall survival (OS). 
Cabazitaxel is another taxane -based chem otherapy that was approved by the FDA, in 2010, in 
patients with mCRPC previously treated with docetaxel.17In the FIRSTANA trial,18which studi ed 
cabazitaxel vs docetaxel as first -line therapy in chemotherapy -naïve mCRPC, different dosages of 
cabazita xel did not show superiorit y over docetaxel . 
Sipuleucel -T19was the first immunotherapy to receive FDA approval in men wi th asymptom atic 
mCRPC based on the Phase III IMPACT trial which showed a median survival o f 25.8 m onths vs 
21.7 months (placebo arm). Two androgen -directed therapi es, abiraterone acetate and 
enzalutamide, were approved by the FDA for post chemotherapy20,21and chemotherapy -naïve22,23
mCRPC patients. Furtherm ore, bone targeting alpha
-emitting radionuclide radium-223 chloride 
(radium-223)24was approved in men with symptomati c bone metastases but no visceral disease, 
based on data from the ALSYMPCA trial which showed a median OS benefit (HR, 0.7; 14.9 vs 
11.3 months; P <0.001). However, cross -resistance has been observed between some of these 
agents (ie, enzalutamide and abiraterone; abiraterone and docetaxel) and a lack of consensus 
currently exists on optimal sequencing of these therapies in mCRPC. 
The use of some of these agents has now expanded into earlier stages of the disease, with 
docetaxel25and abiraterone26,27demonstrating a significant OS improvement in metastati c 
cstrati on-sensi tive prostate cancer (
mCSPC) which led to their approval  in this setting. 
Enzalutamide has also been tested in in men with m CSPC 28and recently showed to s ignificant ly 
improve rPFS and other efficacy endpo ints compared to ADT alone. Furtherm ore, both 
enzalutamide29and apal utamide30, another second -generat ion antiandrogen that is an irreversible 
AR antagonist, showed improved metastasis -free survival in non-metastati c CRPC and were 
approved in 2018. More recently, darolutamide31, an AR antagonist related to enzalutamide and 
apalutamide, but with a high affini ty for AR and low affinit y for GABA receptors, has 
demonstrated a significant improvement of metastasis -free survival (MFS) in M0 CRPC (HR 0.41; 
40.4 m onths wi th darol utamide vs 18.4 months with pl acebo; P <0.0001). It i s unknown if using 
chemotherapy and AR-directed agent therapy  for the upfront treatm ent of mCSPC and in 
non-metastatic CRPC will alter disea se bio logy, clinical course, and sequencing of these agents in 
the mCRPC setting.

Significant progress has been made in the last few years in the treatment and understanding of the 
biology of CRPC and mole cular classificat ion is likely to guide future treatment strategies. 
Olaparib and rucaparib are two examples of PARP inhibitors that are being invest igated in a 
molecularly  defined mCRP C subgroup and received FDA breakthrough therapy  designation in 
2016 and in 2018, respectively. Olaparib as a treatment for BRCA1/2 or ATM-mutated mCRPC 
in pat ients who have received a prior taxane -based chemotherapy and at least one hormonal agent, 
either enzalutamide or abiraterone based on the initial results o f Phase 2 TOPARP -A32trial, which 
found that 88% of participants with DNA -repai r defects (DRD) (n=16) had a response (composite 
response endpoint including PSA response, objective response, and CTC conversi on) to ol aparib 
vs 6% of patient without DRD. Rucaparib as a treatment for BRCA1/2 -positive mCRPC fo llowing 
at least 1 androgen receptor –directed therapy  and taxane -based chem otherapy based on the 
ongoing TRITON -
233Phase II study , which showed that 44.0% (11/25) of patients with a 
BRCA1/2 al terati on had a confirmed radi ographic response. Recently, findings of TOPARP -B,34
the second stage of the trial where 98 patients were pre-selected based on the detecti on of DNA 
repai r defects, showed a response rate (combined primary endpo int) of 54% overall in the 400 mg 
olaparib cohort and 37% in the 300 mg cohort. Radiographic re sponses based on specific geno mic 
alterati ons were 42.4% in patients with a  B RCA1/2, PALB2 –33.3%, ATM –8.3%, and no 
responses in CDK12 or other geno mic alterations. 
While the availabilit y of these new treatm ent options allows for tailoring therapy to patient  
characterist ics such as presence or absence of symptoms, prior treatm ents, patient preferences, and 
life expectancy , none of these therapi es resul t in durable clinical responses. Despite high initial 
response rates, remissio ns following second -gene ration hormone therapies are temporary  due to 
the occurrence of resistance mechanisms, including androgen receptor (AR) reactivat ion. At this 
time, with judici ous sequencing and use of available new therapies, participants with established 
mCRPC have a life expectancy inthe range of  12 to 35 m onths. Thus mCRPC remains a disease 
with a lethal outcom e with the urgent need for treatment options that will provide durable disease 
control  and l ong term  survival.
3.3.2 Nivolumab Mechanism of Action
Cancer immunotherapy rests on the premise that tum ors can be recognized as foreign rather than 
as self and can be effect ively attacked by an activated immune system . An effective immune 
response in this setting is thought to rely  on immune surveillance of tum or anti gens expre ssed on 
cancer cells that ultimately resul ts in an adapt ive immune response and cancer cell death. 
Meanwhile, tumor progression may depend upon acquisit ion of traits that allow cancer cells to 
evade immunosurveillance and escape effective innate and adapti ve immune responses.35,36,37
Current 
immunotherapy  efforts attem pt to break the apparent tol erance of the immune system  to 
tumor cells and antigens by mechanisms such as introducing cancer antigens by therapeutic 
vaccination or by  modulating regul atory  checkp oints of the immune system . T-cell stimulat ion is 
a complex process involving the integrati on of numerous positive as well as negative co-
stimulatory  signals in addit ion to antigen recognit ion by the T -cell receptor (TCR).38Collect ively, 
these signals gove rn the balance between T- cell activat ion and tol erance.

PD-1 is a member of the CD28 family of T -cell co -stimulatory  receptors that also includes CD28, 
CTLA 4, ICOS, and BTLA.39PD-1 signaling has been shown to inhibit CD28 -mediated 
upregul ation of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, IL-13, interferon-gamma (IFN -γ) and Bcl-xL. PD-1 
expressio n has also been noted to inhibi t T-cell activat ion, and expansi on of  previ ously activated 
cells. Evidence for a negative regulatory role of PD -1 comes from studies of PD -1 deficie nt mice, 
which devel op a variet y of autoimmune phenoty pes.40These resul ts suggest that PD-1 blockade 
has the potenti al to activate anti-self T-cell responses, but these responses are variable and 
dependent upon various host genet ic factors. Thus, PD-1 deficiency or inhibit ion is not 
accompanied by a universal loss of tolerance to self -antigens.
In vitro, nivolumab (BMS -936558) binds to PD -1 with high affinit y (EC50 0.39 -2.62 nM), and 
inhibits the binding of PD-1 to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 (IC50 1 nM). Nivo lumab binds 
specifically to PD -1 and not to related members o f the CD28 family  such as CD28, ICOS, CTLA 
4 and BTLA. Blockade of the PD -1 pathway by nivo lumab results in a reproducible enhancement 
of both proliferat ion and IFN-γ release in the mixed lymphocy te reacti on (MLR). Using a 
cytomegalovirus (CMV) re-stimulation assay with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMC), the effect of nivolumab on antigen specific recall response indicates that nivolumab 
augm ented IFN-γ secre tion fro m CMV spec ific memory T cells in a dose -dependent manner versus 
isoty pe-matched control. In vivo blockade of PD -1 by a murine analog of nivo lumab enhances the 
anti-tumor immune response and resul t in tumor rejection in several  immunocom petent mouse 
tumor models (MC3 8, SA1/N, and PAN02).41
3.3.3 Docetaxel Mechanism of Action
Docetaxel is an anti -neopl astic chem otherapeuti c agent which acts by  disrupting the microtubular 
network that is essenti al for mitotic and interphase cellular functions. See the current prescribing 
information for docetaxel  (Sm PC, USPI, or country -specific label) for more informat ion.42
3.4 Benefit/Risk Assessment
Although multiple new agents have been approved for mCRPC over the last decade, benefits 
remain modest and the median survival o f patients with mCRPC is unsat isfactory  at approximately 
12 to 35 months .43,44,45,46,47It is clear that there is an urgent need for new therapeutic options that 
offer further improvement in cancer control and overall survival .
Nivo lumab has demonstrated significant clinical benefit in the treatm ent of advanced solid 
(eg,melanoma, renal cell carcino ma [RCC], and non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]) and 
hematol ogic (eg, classical Hodgkin Lympho ma [cHL]) malignancies as monotherapy  or in 
combinat ion with other agents such as ipilimumab, depending on the malignancy. Details of the 
clinical act ivity in these various malignancies are provided in the USPI48and SmPC49.
Overall, the safet y profile of nivo lumab is manageable and generally consistent across completed 
and ongo ing clinical t rials wi th no maximum  tolerated dose (MTD) reached at any dose tested up 
to 10 mg/kg. Most adverse events (AEs) were low -grade (Grade 1 to 2) with relat ively few related 
high-grade (Grade 3 to 4) AEs. There was no pattern in the incidence, severit y, or cau sality of AEs 
with respect to nivol umab dose l evel.

A pattern of immune -mediated adverse events (IMAEs) associ ated with nivolumab has been 
defined, for which management algorithms have been developed; these are provided in Appendix 
6. Most high-grade event s were manageable with the use of corticosteroi ds or horm one 
replacement therapy  (in the case of endocrinopathy) as instructed in these algorithms. 
Addit ional details on the safet y profile o f nivolumab, including results fro m other clinical studies, 
are a lso available in the nivo lumab IB.
Notwi thstanding that there have been several immunotherapy  failures in prostate cancer, the 
approval  of cancer vaccine si puleucel -T in the US, together wi th the promising act ivity shown by 
the recent early phase trials ofPD-1 inhibitors in combination withanti-CTLA -4 inhibitors or,
with other non-immunotherapy  agents (ie,docetaxel, enzalutamide and olaparib) have provided 
support for further exploring the use of immune thera pies in prostate cancer.50,51,52,53As outlined 
inSection5.5.2 the purpose of combinat ion immune therapies is to enhance anti
-tumor T-cell 
responses and several lines of evidence support combinat ion of immune therapi es with 
chemotherapy in men with mCRPC. 
Docetaxel has a well-characteri zed AE profile as a cytotoxic chem otherapy, including the potenti al 
of pancytopenia, fluid retent ion, peripheral neuropathi es, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. 
Prelimi nary data from a NSCLC study  suggest that nivolumab in combinat ion with platinum 
doubl et chemotherapy has additive anti-tumor activit y in participants regardless of PD-L1 
expressio n, but wi th a numeri cally higher ORR observed in non-squamous NSCLC.54The sa fety 
profile of nivolumab plus platinum -doublet chemotherapy reflected additive toxicities of the 
individual agents, which were manageable using established safet y guidelines. In addition, the 
safet y and tol erabilit y of docetaxel  in combinat ion with pembro lizumab in patients with mCRPC 
appeared to be acceptable.55Grade 3 -5 treatment -related AEs occurred in 27 (38%) pts, including 
2 deaths from treatm ent-related AEs (pneumo nitis). The most commo nly reported grade 
3treatm ent-related AEs were febrile neutropenia (12%), decreased neutrophil count (6%), colitis 
(4%), and pneumonit is (4%). Most immune -mediated AEs were low grade with the most commo n 
being infusio n-related reactions (11%) and colitis (10%).55Docetaxel is being tested in 
combinat ion with nivolumab in Arm B of the ongoing Phase 2 CA209 -9KD study 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Enrollment has been completed (n = 84) and preliminary result s from the inter im 
analysis have demonstrated promis ing anti-tumor activit y with nonew safet y concerns and as 
described in Section 5.5.2 (Rationale for Immunotherapy in mCRPC) .
To assure an ongoing favorable risk/benefit assessment for participants enrolled into the present 
study , the f ollowing safet y measures will be emplo yed throughout the conduct of the study :
Institution of a Data Moni toring Committee (DMC) to provide independent oversight of safety, 
study  conduct and efficacy of nivolumab in combinat ion with docetaxel .In addi tion, a Study 
Steering Committee (consi sting of selected participating invest igators) will meet regularly to 
advise BM S regarding study -related i ssues, including safet y concerns.
Rigorous safet y monitoring by BMS to ensure participants’ safet y including regul ar and 
system atic review of  safety  data, cl ose follow-up of  reported safety  events, and intensive site 
and study  invest igator training/education on the implementation of the nivolumab toxicity

management algorithms and toxicity management of docetaxel . A BMS Safet y Management 
Team  will review and evaluate all emerging data across the program for potential safet y signa l
assessment in a timely manner. 
Risks will be further minimized by adherence to inclusion and exclusio n select ion criteria (see 
Secti on 6), avoidanc e of prohibited medicat ion (see Secti on 7.7.1 ), close safety  monitoring 
(see Section 9.2Adverse Events and Secti on9.4Safety), and dose adjust ment guidelines (see 
Secti on7.4Dose Modificat ions). These w ill also be clearly discussed and highlighted during 
site visi ts.
In concl usion, treatment of nivolumab in combination with docetaxel in men with mCRPC is 
expected to be tolerable, and toxicities of the treatment are expected to be manageable and 
reversi ble upon dose reduction, treatment interruption, or discont inuat ion. The overall risk -benefit  
of thecombinat ion is deemed acceptable.
Detailed informat ion about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably  anticipated 
AEs of nivolumab may be found in their respective IBs. Similar information is provided for 
docetaxel in the associ ated Patient Inform ation Leaflet, USPI, country -specific label, Devel opment 
Safety Update Report, or SmPC.

OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOI NTS
Table 4-1: Objectives and Endpoints
Objective Endpoint
Primary
To compare the rPFS (using 
PCWG3) of nivolumab in 
combinatio n with docetaxel to 
placebo in combination with 
docetaxel, in men with metastatic 
castration resistant prostate cancer 
(mCRPC).rPFS for randomized participants is the time between 
randomization and the first date of documented progression or death 
due to any cause, whichever occurs first. The radiographic 
progression will be assessed by Blinded Independent Central 
Review (BICR) per PCWG3 . The rPFS will be censored at the last 
tumor assessment up to the start of subsequent systemic cancer 
therapy .
To compare the OS of nivolumab in 
combinatio n with docetaxel to
placebo in combination with 
docetaxel ,in men with metastatic 
castration resistant prostate cancer 
(mCRPC).OS for all randomized participants is the time between 
randomization and the date of death from any cause. For 
participants who are alive, their survival time will be censored at 
the last date that they  were kno wn to be alive. OS will be censored 
for participants at the date of randomization if they  had no follow -
up.
Secondary
To assess the antitumor activity of 
nivolumab in combination with 
docetaxel .Objective Response Rate per PCWG3 (ORR -PCWG3 )is the 
proportion of participants who have a confirmed complete or partial 
best overall response (BOR) per PCWG3 amongrandomized
participants who have measurable disease at baseline .The BOR is 
defined as the best response designation, as determined by the 
BICR, recorded between the date of randomizatio n and the date of 
objectively documented progr ession per PCWG3 or the date of 
subsequent systemic cancer therapy, whichever occurs first. For

PSA Response Rate (PSA -RR) is the proportion of randomiz ed 
participants with a 50% or greater decrease in PSA from baseline to 
the lowest post-baseline PSA result. A second consecutive value 
obtained 3 or more weeks later is required to confirm the PSA 
response. PSA response will be calculated for all participants with 
PSA values at baseline and at least one post -baseline asses sment.
Time to PSA Progression (TTP -PSA ) is the time between 
randomization to the date of PSA progr ession per PCWG3 in 
randomized participants. For participants with an initial PSA 
decline from baseline, the date of PSA progr ession is thedate that 
an incr ease of 25% or more and an absolute increase of 2 ng/mL or 
more from the nadir are documented and confirmed by asecond 
consecutive PSA value at least 3 weeks later. For participants with 
no PSA decline from baseline, the date of PSA progression is the
date that an increase of 25% or mo re and an absolute increase of 2
ng/mL or more from baseline are documented beyond Week 13.

The study  design schema tic is presented in Figure 5.1-1.
CA2097DX is a Phase 3 randomized, double -blinded , multi-center clinical trialcompar ing 
nivolumab or pl acebo in combinat ion with docetaxel , in men with metastati c castrati on-resistant 
prosta tecancer .
The study  will randomize up to approximately  984 participant s 1:1 into 1 of the 2 treatment arms 
(nivo lumab combined with docetaxel  or docetaxel combined with placebo ).The primary  endpo ints 
of the study  are rPFS and OS, as described in Sect ion4.
Per Protocol Amendment 04, full study teams and investigators were unblinded to study 
treatment assignment on 03
-AUG -2023 due to the lack of rPFS and OS benefit from 
nivolumab added to docetaxel plus prednisone compared to placebo added to docetaxel plus 
prednisone.

Following confirmation of eligibilit y, partici pants will be randomized to receive nivolumab or 
placebo in combinat ion with docetaxel.
The treatm ent period will consist of a combinat ion phase (nivo lumab or pl acebo in combinat ion 
with docetaxel for up to 10 cycles) and a monotherapy  phase (nivo lumab or placebo) as described 
above in Sect ion 5.1. Treatment with nivo lumab will be given for a maximum of 24 months from 
date of first dose in the absence of disease progressio n, unacceptable toxicity or other reasons 
specified in the protoc ol. See Section 7.1(Treatm ents administered) for details o f treatm ents. 
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04: PK sam ples and immun ogenici ty samples will  be 
collected according to schedules in Table 9.5-1
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04: Tumor assessments shoul d occur every 9 weeks 
(7 days) from first dose, regardless of treatm ent schedule or dose delays,for first 54 weeks. 
Thereafter switch to every 12 weeks (7 days). Imaging must continue until radiographic 
progression per PCWG3 is assessed by invest igator, and confirmed by BICR, or treatm ent is 
discontinued, whichever occurs later. See Section 9.1.1 (Imaging Assessment for the Study ) and 
Secti on 9.1.2 (BICR Confirmation of Progressio n).Per Protocol Amendment 04, all 
participants receiving study treatment will have radiographic tumor assessments based on 
the clinical judgment of the treating investigator and following imaging tumor assessment 
local guidelines for mCRPC.
Per Protocol Amendment 04, decisions on docetaxel treatment will be based on the clinical 
judgment of the treating physician and on shared decis ion making with the participant. 
Participants who are not able to access local therapy may continue on study -provided 
docetaxel until local access is available. In the event that the investigator deems a participant 
is deriving clinical benefit from nivolu mab therapy and, together with the counseled 
participant, wishes to continue treatment, this may be possible following discussion with the 
Medical Monitor to ensure a clinical rationale exists that justifies continuation of nivolumab 
treatment.
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04: In certain circumstances, participants with

Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04: BMS may request that survival data be collected 
on all treated participants outsi de of the protocol  defined window as detailed in the Schedule of 
Activities in
 Sect ion 2. At the time of this request, each participant will be contacted to determine 
their survival status unless the participant has withdrawn consent for all contact .
5.2 Data Monitoring Committee and Other External Committees
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04 due to study termination.
To provide independent oversi ght of safety, efficacy , and study  conduct, an independent Data 
Moni toring Committee (DMC) will be established to provide oversight on safet y and efficac y 
considerations. Details o f the DMC responsibili ties and procedures will be specified in the DMC 
charter. 
A Study Steering Commit tee (consisting of selected participating invest igators) will meet regul arly 
to advise BMS regarding study -related issues, including safet y concerns.
When requi red, adjudicated events will be submitted to the DMC and Health Authorities for review 
on a specified timeframe in accordance wit h the adjudicat ion documentation.
5.3 Number of Participants
Assuming a 25% screen failure rate, it is estimated that approximately 1,312 participants with 
mCRPC, will be enrolled in order to randomize approximately 984 participants . See Secti on10.1
for a descript ion of the sample size calculat ion.Recrui tment was completed globally as of 13-Jun-
2022. China region will continue enrolling until required number of participants to satisfy 
regul atory  requi rements isachieved ( approximately  15% of  the gl obal partici pants )
.
5.4 End of Study Definition
Per Protocol Amendment 04, the study will be terminated, and the first interim analysis will 
be considered the final analysis. The end of the trial is defined as when the la st participant 
receiving study -provided nivolumab completes 100 days of safety follow -up after their last 
nivolumab infusion . Study  com pletion is defined as the final date on which data for the primar y 
endpo int was or i s expected to be collected, if this is not the same .
The total duration o f the study fro m the date of first participant treated to the final analysis of both 
primary  endpoints i s expected to be approximately 31 months. 
5.5 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
5.5.1 Rationale for Population
Men with metastati c CRPC who have progressed after 1or 2 NATs and have not received 
chemotherapy for mCRPC will be included in this study .Although most patients without 
symptoms are not treated with chemotherapy, the survival benefit reported with docetaxel appli es 
to those wi th or wi thout symptom s. NCCN guidelines recommends to use docetaxel  (category  1)

as the preferred 1st line chemotherapy in men with symptomat ic mCRPC and inpatients with signs 
of rapid progressi on or visceral metastases despite lack of sympt oms. Docetaxel also has a cat egory 
1 recommendat ion in second -line after prior enzalutamide/abiraterone. Clinical data from a 
number of small retrospective cohort studies suggests that once participant s with mCRPC progress 
response rates to abiraterone aft er enzalutamide and conversely enzalutamide after abiraterone are 
low and no robust criteria exist clinically to select one drug rather than the other.56
Given that abiraterone and enzal utamide are the preferred 1st line option for men with 
asymptomat ic, ch emotherapy -naïve mCRPC and the recent approvals of next gen eration hormonal 
therapi es in mCSPC and M0 CRPC settings, it is expected that most patients will have received 
one of these agents when they develop mCRPC. Therefore, the current study  will include chem o-
naïve mCRPC patients who are post-1 or 2 prior lines of second -generat ion horm onal therapies. 
No m ore than 1 prior NAT is allowed in the mCRPC setting. The study  will stratify by prior NAT 
(1 pri or NAT for mCRPC vs 1 prior NAT for nmCRPC/mCSPC vs 2 prior NAT) in order to 
account for potential differences in survival outcomes.
Significant progress made over the last few years in understanding the biology and molecular 
classificat ion of CRPC, wi th Olaparib and rucaparib being two examples of PARP inhib itors that 
are being investigated in a mo lecularly defined mCRPC subgroup, namely pat ients with mutations 
in specific HRD genes, such as BRCA1/2 and ATM. Data from the Phase 2 Check -Mate 650 study 
(NIVO1+IPI3) presented at ASCO -GU in Feb-201957demonstrated clinical activity in mCRPC, 
with ORR of 10% and 25% in chem otherapy -pretreated and chemotherapy -naïve patients, 
respectively , and preliminary  evidence of tumor mutati onal burden (TMB) as a biomarker for 
immuno -oncol ogy (IO)activit y in a subgroup of patie nts with tumor sam ples evaluable for whole 
exome sequencing. However, little published data are available on the efficacy  of chemotherapy 
by biomarker status in advanced prostate cancer as several older trials did not include next-
generat ion sequencing of tumor samples.  
5.5.2 Rationale for Immunotherapy in mCRPC
Like most types of cancer, prostate cancer devel ops in an immune -competent environment. 
Immune responses against prostate tumors are noted in the form of intratum oral leukocy te 
infiltrat ion and inflammatory  pathway  activation.58Evidence from animal models and human 
prostate cancer suggests that, despite the prese nce of immune effector cells that recogni ze tumor 
antigens, these cells are act ively tolerized and become incapable o f mediat ing tumor destruction.59
The induct ion of regulatory or suppressor T cells60with increased CD4+CD25+ and CD8+Foxp3+ 
regul atory  T  cells (Treg), detected both within prostate glands and in the peripheral  blood of 
prostate cancer subjects, suggests the presence of active immune suppressio n of antitumor 
immunit y.61,62
An analysis of the prognostic significance of PD-1 and/or PD-L1 expressio nin a cohort of 
535prostate cancer tumors showed that a high densit y of PD-1+ lymphocy tes independent ly 
predi cted shorter clinical failure -free survival .63This may indicate that tumor immune escape, and

thus tum or immune eliminat ion, are important m echani sms in prostate cancer and the associ ation 
of pathway mo lecules wit h poor prognosis makes them attractive targets for inhibit ion. These lines 
of evidence support targeti ng the immune system itself, via activati on of  T cells and overcoming 
T-cell tolerance, to resul t in durable ant itumor activit y in prostate cancer.
Two Phase 3 Studi es (CA184043 and CA184095) carri ed out subsequently have failed to show a 
clear-cut surviv al advantage for ipilimumab (10mg/kg) over placebo, although some patients 
achieved sustained co mplete responses and treatment with ipilimumab was associated with longer 
median PFS and higher PSA response rate.64,65More recent ly, the approval  of cancer vaccine 
sipuleucel -T in the US, together with the promising activit y shown by the recent early phase trials 
of immune checkpo int inhibitors66,10 ,52, 53,57have provided support for further exploring the use of 
immun e therapi es in prostate cancer.
The IMPACT study  evaluated sipuleucel -T (Provenge , Dendreon Corp., Seattle, WA), an 
autol ogous therapeuti c vaccine, vs placebo in chemotherapy -naïve CRPC participants and reported 
a 4.1-month survival improvement in asymptomat ic or minimally symptom atic 
CRPC participants.67While these data show little overall impact on delaying progressi on of 
disease, the reported benefits in OS m ay be considered “proof of concept” that immunotherapeutic 
agents can play an important role in treati ng advanced prostate cancer.68
Prostate cancer has been shown to have low tumor expressi on of PD-L12and single- agents anti-
programmed death -1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunotherapies have shown 
limited clinical success in prostate cancer patients, particularly when compared toother cancer 
types such as melano ma and non -small  cell l ung cancers . In a cohort of 17 subjects with mCRPC ,
nivolumab 10 mg/kg showed no object ive responses .69One out of 10 subjects evaluable for PSA 
response demonstrated a PSA reducti on 50% frombaseline. Prostate tumor samples were 
available in 2 subjects with mCRPC, and tumor PD-L1expressio n was 0% in both subjects.
Atezolizumab monotherapy  was evaluated in a Phase 1a study, including 15 heavily pretreated 
subjects with mCRPC.70There were no objective responses per RECIST 1.1, although 1 subject 
had a PR per immune -related response criteria (irRC). Pembrolizumab was recently evaluated in 
a Phase 2 study  of mCRPC patients previously treated with docetaxel .71Among those with 
measurable diseas e, ORR was 3% and 5% in PD-L1 negat ive (n=66) and positive (n= 133) 
patients, respectively. PSA responses were observed in 11% of evaluable patients (n=193). 
Amo ng 19 patients with so matic aberrations in BRCA1/2 or ATM, ORR was 11%, suggesting that 
DNA repair defects may be associated with anti -tumor activi ty.
However, immunotherapy -based combinat ions couldpotenti ally result inincreasing immune -
mediated anti
-tumor activit y in subjects with prostate cancer. Nivo lumab plus ipilimumab
demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with mCRPC and further evaluat ion of the clinical 
activit y of this combinat ion, as well as the potential  associ ation between biomarkers is current ly 
ongoing in study  CA209650.57In addi tion to this study , an open -label P hase 2 tri al of nivo lumab 
combined with rucaparib, docetaxel, or enzalutamide in patients with mCRPC ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is 
ongoing.

ADT , which has been shown to alter the immune environment in prostate cancer, plays a central 
role in the treatm ent of high-risk early PCa and recurrent or metastati c disease . Therefore, it is 
cruci al that immune -based therapies are compatible and, preferably, show synergist ic activit y.8
For example, neoadj uvant ADT of prostate cancer patients resul ts in increased numbers of 
infiltrat ing CD4 T-cells, CD8 T-cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages in prostate 
tissues.6,7Similarly, th ere is growing evidence that chemotherapy can induce immuno -modulatory 
effects that could facilit ate the induction o f antitumor immunit y.
Nivolumab in combination with Docetaxel
Docetaxel, a second -generat ion semisynt hetic taxane analog, became the first chemotherapeutic 
agent to show an OS benefit in mCRPC in two randomized controlled clinical trials (TAX 327 and 
SWOG 99 -16), and was approved in combinat ion with predniso ne for this indication in the US in 
2004.15,16In the landmark TAX 327 Phase 3 trial, 1006 participants with mCRPC were 
rando mized to receive daily  prednisone and either mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 Q3W, docetaxel 
75mg/m2Q3W, or docetaxel  30 m g/m2QW for 5 of  every 6 weeks .15Participants who received 
docetaxel Q3W had a median survival of 19.2 months, compared to 16.3 months in the 
mitoxantrone Q3W and 17.8 months in the docetaxel QW arms. The hazard ratio for th e docetaxel 
Q3W arm was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62 to 0.94; P =0.009). It is hypothesized that 
chemotherapy may modify the immune response to tum ors by influencing multip le mechanisms, 
including inducing immunogenic cell death, stimulating r elease of tumor antigens and/or deplet ing 
immuno -suppressive Tregs. Chemotherapies (docetaxel, cabazitaxel) can have profound effects 
on the immune system , including acute reducti ons in NK, T, and B cells. Paradoxically , while 
treatm ent with docetaxel may induce lymphocytopenia in pat ients,72upon regenerat ion of immune 
cell populati ons, an enhanced ant i-tumor immune response can occur through a reduction of 
immunosuppressive cell ty pes, including myelo id-derived suppressor cell ( MDSC )suppressio n73
and the s elect ive deplet ion of Treg cells .74In mouse models, the administration of docetaxel after 
vaccine -based immunotherapy  increased the response compared to either treatm ent alone,75
potenti ally as a result of increased T cell response and neoant igen presentati on.76Docetaxel has 
been reported to increase the producti on of proinflammatory  cytokines which may enhance the 
immune response.77In patient studies, evaluat ing immune response to taxanes in breast cancer,

increased T-Cell and natural  killer (NK) activat ion is also correlated with the use of  docetaxel .78
These findings indicate that use of immunotherapy may  augment the enhanced immune response 
seen following the use of standard- of-care chemotherapy  and have led to the development of 
clinical trials evaluating the combinat ion of docetaxel and various immune therapy  approaches.
Nivo lumab has been co mbined with docetaxel and other taxane agents, such as paclitaxel, and also 
with other cytotoxi c agents. The combinat ion of nivolumab with platinum -based doubl et 
chemotherapy has shown promising activit y and limited added toxicityin a Phase 1 study in 
NSCLC.79In this study , 14 participants were treated with nivolumab 5 mg/kg (equivalent to a 
360mg flat dose), 200mg/m2paclitaxel, and carbopl atin Q3W for 4 cycles, followed by 
nivolumab alone until disease progressi on or unacceptable toxicity. The most commo n toxicities 
reported wi th the combinat ion were those expected for chem otherapy  aloneand included fatigue, 
nausea, and decreased appet ite. Treatment -related select AEs (those AEs with an immuno logical 
etiology) were slight ly higher than seen with nivolumab monotherapy . Sel ect AEs of skin rash 
occurred in 5 participants (36%, with 1 Grade 3-4 AE), diarrhea in 3 participants (21%, Grade 1 -2), 
acute renal failure in 2 participants (14%, Grade 3-4), and pneumo nitis in 2 participants (with 1 
Grade 3-4). All select AEs were effectively  managed with corticosteroi ds, and none resul ted in 
death. Co mpared to historical controls, the activit y of the combinat ion, even in such a small cohort, 
was encouraging. The ORR was 43%, wit
h 6 participants achieving a partial response (PR). The 
median DOR was 19.6 months, the median PFS was 7.1 months, and the 6-month PFS rate was 
51%. Median OS had not been reached at the time of the database lock, but 1 -year and 2 -year OS 
rates were 86% and 62%, respectively. 
In a Phase 1, open -label, uncontrolled study  of nivolumab in combinat ion with chemotherapy in 
participan ts with Stage IIIB/IV or recurrent NSCLC (ONO -
4538- 04, see the current IB for 
nivolumab for more information), nivolumab 10mg/kg was administered in combinat ion with 
docetaxel in 6 Japanese participants. The most commo n drug-related AEs reported in at least 
2participants were neutrophil count decreased, white blood cell count decreased, lymphocyte 
count decreased and alopecia. AEs leading to nivolumab discont inuat ion were observed in 
3participants (hypothyroidism, lung infect ion, and infusio n
-related rea ction); hypothy roidism and 
infusio n-related reacti on were considered possibly  related to nivo lumab.
In mCRPC, docetaxel  is being tested in combinatio n with nivolumab in Arm B of the ongoing 
Phase 2 CA209 -9KD study  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in patients who had received up to two prior second -
generat ion horm onal manipulati on in the pre-chemotherapy setting. Enrollment has been 
completed (n =84) and an interim analysis was conducted in 41 patients with at least 16 weeks of 
follow
-up (Database lock date 09 -May-2019). The safet y of the combinat ion was consistent wi th 
the profiles of individual  agents, with 49% of patients experiencing Grade 3-4 treatm ent- related 
adverse events. Preliminary antitumor activit y appeared promising, with ORR being 37%, PSA-
RR 47% and rPFS 8.2 mo nths.
In addition, the combinat ion of pembro lizumab and docetaxel was tested in 72 pts with mCRPC 
who progressed after either abiraterone or enzalutamide .10The preliminary result s showed that the 
combinat ion was generally well tolerated with promising ant i-tumor activit y (ORR 14%; PSA -RR

31%; time to PSA progression 5.5 and 7 months for patients with measurable and non -measurable 
disease, respectively; rPFS 8 months; OS NR [12.9 to NR]), and potenti al benefit vs docetaxel 
alone.
Given the well characterized AE profile of docetaxel (ie, pancytopenia, fluid retention, peripheral 
neuropathi es, diarrhea, nausea, and vo miting) and the eviden ce from combinat ion studies showing 
that the safet y profile of nivolumab plus chem otherapy  can be managed using established safet y 
guidelines, the proposed combinat ion of nivolumab and docetaxel is expected to bring clinical 
benefits wit h manageable safet yto men wi th mCRPC.
5.5.3 Rationale for Choice of Endpoints
OS is easily  measured, unambiguous, obj ective, and unaffected by  the timing of  assessment. It i s 
considered the gold standard among efficacy  endpoints (clinically and regul atory  accepted), and 
an appropriate measure of treatment benefit for immune checkpo int inhibitors. However, given the 
availabilit y of effective systemic therapies to treat mCRP C patients in the post-docetaxel setting 
(eg, abiraterone, enzalutamide, cabazitaxel, radium -223), rPFS has been chosen as a second 
primary  endpoint as it will not be confounded by subsequent treatments.
5.5.4 Rationale for Sample Size Determination
The sample size of the study  accounts for the two primary endpo ints: rPFS and OS. The 
assumpt ions of rPFS and OS were derived fro m the following studi es:
two Phase 3 studi es that led to docetaxel approval  (TAX32715: OS 19.9 mo; 
SWOG991616:rPFS 6.3 m o; OS 17.5 mo) .
two retrospective docetaxel studi es conducted in thepost-abiraterone setting 
(Azad 201480:rPFS 4 mo, OS 11.6 mo; Mezynski 201281: OS 12.5 m o).
Since the pivotal  Phase 3 studi es were conducted approximately  15 years ago prior to novel 
antiandrogen therapi es approval  and survival  outc omes have improved since then, a more recent 
study  evaluat ing 1st line docetaxel vs cabazitaxel (Firstana: rPFS 12. 1 mo derived fro m composite 
PFS endpo int) was also used for rPFS assumpt ions.82
Therefore, the expected rPFS and OS wi th docetaxel  monotherapy  in the chosen popul ation are6 
months and 15 months ,respect ively.
Delayed separat ion of KM curves is included in the alternat ive hypotheses for rPFS and OS 
because a delayed immunotherapy  effect was observed in various tumors.83 84 85 86

5.5.5 Rationale for Duration of Study Treatment
5.5.5.1 Nivolumab
The optimal durat ion of immunotherapy is an important question and continues to be invest igated.

months,87,88,89,90,91and emer ging data suggest that benefit can be maintained in the absence of 
continued treatment. A recent analysis in a melano ma study  suggests the majorit y of patients who 
discontinue nivolumab and/or ipilimumab for toxici ty maintain disease control  in the absence of 
further treatm ent.92Furtherm ore, a limited durat ion of ipilimumab, including only 4 induct ion 
doses, resul ted in long term survival in patients with metastatic melano ma, with a sustained plateau 
in survival starting around 2 y ears after the start of tr eatment.93
Accumulat ing data suggest that 2 y ears of  PD-1 checkpo int inhibitor treatm ent m ay be sufficient 
for long term benefi t. CA209003, a dose-escalat ion cohort expansio n trial evaluat ing the safet y 
and clinical activi ty of nivolumab in patients wit
h previously treated advanced solid tumors 
(including 129 subjects with NSCLC), specified a maximum treatment duration of 2 years. Among 
16 subjects with NSCLC who discont inued nivolumab after completing 2 years of treatment, 
12subjects were alive > 5 years and remained progressi on-free without any subsequent therapy . 
In the CA209003 NSCLC cohort, the OS curve begins to plateau after 2 y ears, wi th an OS rate of 
25% at 2 years and 18% at 3 years.94These survival  outcom es are similar to Phase 3 studi es in 
previo usly treated NSCLC, in which nivolumab treatm ent was continued until progressi on or 
unacceptable toxicity (2 year OS rates of 23% and 29%, and 3 year OS rates of 16% to18% for 
squamous and non -squamous NSCLC, respect ively).95
Similar resul ts have been repor ted in clinical studies of pembro lizumab, another PD-1 inhibitor . 
Keynote -010 was a rando mized Phase 3 trial of pembro lizumab (at either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks) versus docetaxel in subjects with previously treated, PD-L1-posit ive, advanced 
NSCLC which specified a maximum treatm ent durati on of 2 years for pembrolizumab. OS was 
significant ly longer with both pembro lizumab 2 mg/kg (HR 0.72, P = 0.00017) and 
pembro lizumab 10 mg/kg (HR 0.60, P < 0.00001) compared to docetaxel, with an OS plateau 
devel oping beyo nd 2 years in both pembro lizumab arms. Amo ng 690 patients who received 
pembro lizumab, 47patients completed 2 years of pembro lizumab and stopped treatm ent. Most
were able to maintain their response, including those with stable disease, with only 2 pat ients (4%) 
having confirmed progression after stopping at 2 years.96
Keynote -006 was a randomized Phase 3 study  of pembro lizumab versus ipilimumab in patients 
with advanced melano ma, which also specified a maximum 2 year durati on of pembro lizumab 
treatment. 104 (19%) of 556 patients rando mized to pembro lizumab completed 2 years of 
treatm ent. With a median follow -up of 9 months after complet ion of pembrolizumab, the estimated 
risk of progression or death was 9% in these patients.97
Taken together, these data suggest that treatm ent beyo nd 2 years is unlikely to confer additional 
clinically meaningful benefit and that the risk of progression after discont inuing treatm ent at 
2years is low.
In contrast, a shorter duration of nivolumab of only 1 year was associated with increased risk of 
progression in previously  treated pati ents with NSCLC, suggesting that treatm ent beyond 1 year 
is likely needed. In CA209153, patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC who completed 
1 year of nivo lumab therapy were rand omized to either continue or stop treatment, with the option

of retreatment upon progression. Amo ng 163 patients still on treatm ent at 1 year and without 
progression, those who were randomized to continue nivolumab had significant improvement in 
progressio n-free survival (PFS) compared to those who were randomized to stop treatm ent, with 
median PFS (post- randomizat ion) not reached vs 10.3 m onths, respect ively; HR=0.42 (95% CI, 
0.25 to 0.71). With a median fo llow-up of 14.9 months post -randomizat ion, there also was a trend 
for pati ents on con tinued treatment to live longer (OS HR =0.63 [95% CI: 0.33 to1.20]). Of note, 
the PFS curves in both groups plateau approximately  1 year af ter randomizat ion (ie, 2 y ears after 
treatm ent init iation), suggest ing that there may be minimal benefit in extending treatment bey ond 
a total  of 2 years.98
Collect ively, these data suggest that there is minimal if any benefi t derived from continuing I -O 
treatm ent beyo nd 2years in advanced tumors. However, even though immunotherapy  is well 
tolerated, patients will be at risk for addit ional toxicit y with longer term treatm ent. Therefore, in 
this study , treatm ent will be given for a maximum of 2 y ears fro m the start of study  treatm ent.
5.5.5.2 Docetaxel
The durati on of treatm ent for docetaxel, shoul d be based on the assessment of benefi t and 
toxicities. In a pivotal trial establishing the survival advantage of docetaxel chem otherapy , 
participants received up to 10 cycles of treatment .15Administering more than 10 cycles of 
docetaxel has not dem onstrated any  further improvement in survival and is associated wi th more 
adverse effects.99,100Therefore, in the present study, docetaxel will be administered for a 
maximum of 10 cycles, or until disease progressio n, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal  of 
participant consent, or the end of the study , whichever occurs sooner .
Please consult the current prescribing information for docetaxel for further details concerning 
administration. 
5.5.6 Rationale for Nivolumab 30 -Minute Infusion
Long infusio n times place a burden on participants and treatm ent centers. Nivo lumab was 
originally approved in the US wi th a 60 -minute infusio n using 3 mg/kg Q2W body  weight -based 
dosing and is now approved in the US using a 30 minute infusion for the 240 mg Q2 W and 480 mg 
Q4W flat doses. Previous clinical studies show that nivolumab has been administered safely over 
60minutes at doses ranging up to 10 mg/kg over long treatm ent durations. In Study CA209010 
(aPhase 2, randomized, double -blind, dose-ranging study of nivolumab in participants with 
advanced/metastatic clear cell RCC), a dose associat ion was observed for infusio n site react ions 
and hypersensit ivity react ions (1.7% at 0.3 m g/kg, 3.7% at 2 m g/kg, and 18.5% at 10 m g/kg). All 
the events were Grade 1-2 and were manageable. An infusio n durati on of  30 minutes for 360 m g 
or 480 mg doses of nivolumab is not expected to present safet y concerns compared to th e prior 
experience at 10-mg/kg nivolumab dose infused over a 60-minute durati on. Nivo lumab 480 mg 
Q4W an d nivo lumab 360 mg Q3W infused over 30 minutes are also being investigated in several 
ongoing clinical studies. Overall, preliminary  safety  analysis suggests that the safet y profile of 
nivolumab administered IV over 30minutes at 480 mg Q4W or 360 mg Q3W is consistent with 
nivolumab 240 mg Q2W or 3 mg/kg Q2W administered IV over 30 or 60 minutes across mult iple 
tumor types with respect to Grade 3-4 AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs leading to

discontinuat ion, and immune -mediated AEs (IMAEs) including hypersensit ivity/infusio n react ion 
IMAEs. There were no new safet y concerns i dentified. For study  CA2099KD (a Phase 2 study  of 
nivolumab in combinat ion with either rucaparib, docetaxel or enzalutamide in men with mCRPC) , 
the protocol specifies monitoring and management of safety events including nivolumab -related 
infusio n react ions. In summary, nivo lumab 360 mg Q3W or nivo lumab 480 mg Q4W infused over 
30 minutes is expected to provide a comparable safet y profile to that seen with a  60-minute 
infusio n, and i s not expected to present addit ional safet y concerns.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.6 Justification for Dose
5.6.1 Justification for Nivolumab Dos e
Nivo lumab will be administered as a flat dose of 360 mg once every 3 weeks (Q3W) in 
combinat ion with docetaxel for a maximum o f 10 cycles , in order to maintain synchronized dosing 
of both agents on the same day and then switch to a nivolumab dose of 480 mg given every 4 
weeks (Q4W) for dosing convenience. 
Nivo lumab PK has been extensively  studied in multiple tumor types, including melanoma, 
NSCLC, RCC, cHL, SCCHN, CRC and urothelial carcino ma and has been safely administered at 
doses up to 10 mg/kg Q2W. Nivo lumab monotherapy  was originally approved as a body -weight 
based dose of 3 mg/kg Q2W, and was recent ly updated to 240 mg Q2 W or 480 mg Q4W in mult iple 
indicat ions.101,102Nivo lumab 360 mg Q3W is also under evaluat ion in monotherapy  and in 
combinat ion therapy  studi es. Less frequent 360 mg Q3W and 480 mg Q4W dosing regimens can 
reduce the burden to patients of frequent, lengthy  IV treatm ents and allow combinat ion of 
nivolumab with other agents using alternat ive dosing regimens. 
The benefit -risk profiles of nivo lumab 240 mg Q2W, 360 mg Q3W and 480 mg Q4W are predicted 
to be comparable to 3 mg/kg Q2W. This assessment is based on a co mprehensive c haracteri zation 
of nivolumab PK, safet y, efficacy, and exposure -response relationships across indicat ions. 
Popul ation PK (PPK) analyses have shown that the PK of nivolumab is linear with proporti onal 
exposures over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg; no clini cally meaningful differences in PK across 
ethnicit ies and tumor types were observed. Using the PPK model, the exposures following 
administration of several  dosing regimens of nivolumab administered as a flat dose were 
simulated, including 240 mg Q2W, 360 m g Q3W and 480 mg Q4W. The simulated average serum 
concentration at steady  state [Cavgss] following administrati on of nivolumab 360 mg Q3W and

480 mg Q4W are predicted to be similar to those following administrati on of  nivolumab 240 mg 
Q2W and nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W administered to parti cipants over a wide body  weight range 
(34to 180kg) across tumor types.
Extensive exposure -response (E-R) analyses of multiple PK measures (maximum  serum 
concentration at Day 1 [Cmax1], average serum concentration at Day 28 [Cavg28], and trough 
serum  concentrati on at Day 28 [Cmin28]) and efficacy  and safet y endpo ints indicated that the 
efficacy of the flat-dose 480 mg IV regimen are similar to that of  3 mg/kg Q2W IV regimen. In 
E-R efficacy analyses for OS and ORR conducted in melano ma, RCC, and NSCLC using Cavg28 
as the exposure measure, probabilit ies of achieving a response and survival probabilit ies at 1 y ear 
and 2 y ears for IV 480 mg Q4W were sim ilar to that of IV 3 mg/kg Q2W. In E-R safet y analyses, 
it was demonstrated that the exposure margins for safet y are maintained following nivolumab 
480mg Q4W, and the predi cted ri sks of  discont inuations due to AEs or death, AE Grade 3+, and 
immune -mediated AEs (IMAEs) Grade 2+ are similar fo llowing nivo lumab 480 mg Q4W relative 
to nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W across tumor ty pes. In addition, nivolumab exposures with 240 mg 
Q2W, 360 mg Q3W, and 480 mg Q4W flat-dose IV regimens across tum or ty pes are maintained 
well below the corresponding exposures observed with the well -tolerated 10 mg/kg I V nivo lumab 
Q2W dose regimen.

any serious AEs.
6.4.1 Retesting During Screening 
This study  permits the re-enrollment of a
 participant who has discontinued the study  as a pre-
treatm ent failure (ie, participant has not been treated). If re-enrol led, the participant must be 
re-consented.
Retesting of laboratory  parameters and/or other assessments within any single Screening or
Lead -in period will be perm itted (in addit ion to any parameters that require a confirmatory value).
The most current resul t prior torandomizat ionis the value by which study  inclusio n will be 
assessed, as it represents the participant’s most current, clinical state.
Laboratory  parameters and/or assessments that are included in Table 2-1Screening Procedural 
Outline may be repeated in an effort to find all possible well-qualified participants. Consultatio n 
with the Medical  Monitor/designee may be needed to ident ify whether repeat testing of any

study treatment assignment on 03-A ug- 2023 ;therefore, no participant receiving study 
treatment will receive placebo.
Parti cipants will receive nivo lumab or placebo IV at a flat dose of 360 mg as a 30 -minute infusio n 
in combination with docetaxel  IV at 75 mg/m2as a 1-hour infusio n Q3W and prednisone 
(orpredn isolone) 5 mg orally twi ce daily continuously. Oral dexamethasone 8 mg (or equivalent 
dose of another corticosteroid) to be administered at 12 hours, 3 hours ,and 1 hour before the 
docetaxel infusio n. Other schedules and routes of administrati on are al so acceptable according to 
local standards
After the nivolumab or placebo infusio n, there is a 3 0-minute delay  before the start of the docetaxe l 
infusio n to monitor the participant for signs of possible infusio n react ions and differentiate any 
such reacti on from one related to the subsequent docetaxel infusio n. Dosing of docetaxel  and 
prednisone (or predniso lone) will continue for a maximum o f 10 cy cles every  3 weeks (± 3 days), 
until progressi on, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal  of consent, or the study ends, whichever 
occurs first.
Dosing calculat ions of docetaxel should be based on the body weight assessed at baseline. It is not 
necessary  to re-calculate subsequent doses if the participant weight is within 10% of the weight 
used to calculate the previous dos e. All doses should be rounded up or to the nearest milligram per 
institutional standard.
Parti cipants shoul d begin study  treatm ent wi thin 3 cal endar day s ofstart of randomizat ion

7.1.2 Nivolumab or Placebo Dosing
Per Protocol Amendment 04, due to lack of rPFS benefit at the final analysis and OS benefit 
at the first interim analysis for nivolumab added to docetaxel plus prednisone compared to 
placebo added to docetaxel plus prednisone, on 26-Jul -2023, a BMS EOC decided to 
terminate the study. The decision to terminate the study was not based on any safety 
concerns or issues. Full study teams and investigators were unblinded to study treatment 
assignment on 03 -Aug-2023; therefore, no participant receiving study treatment will receive 
placebo.

After the completion of maximum 10 cycles of combination treatment, nivolumab dosing will 
change to 480 mg. Nivolumab 480 mg or placebo IV will continue to be given alone as a 30-minute 
infusion as maintenance therapy Q4W ( s3 days). The treatment with nivolumab or placebo will 
be given until progression, unacceptable toxicity, completion of 24 months of treatment, 
withdrawal of consent, or the study ends, whichever occurs first.
There will be no dose escalations or reductions of nivolumabor placeboallowed. For Q4W dosing 
cycles, all participants may be dosed within a ±3 day window. 
Doses of nivolumabor placebo may be interrup ted, delayed, or discontinued depending on how 
well the participant tolerates the treatment. Dosing visits are not skipped, only delayed.
For nivolumab, refer to the current version of the Investigator Brochure and/or Pharmacy Manual 
for complete storage, handling, dispensing, and infusion information.
Nivolumab infusions are compatible with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or polyolefin containers and 
infusion sets, and glass bottles.
Premedication:
Premedications are not recommended for the first dose of nivolumab or placebo.
For docetaxel, given the concurrent use of pr ednisone, the recommende d premedication regimen 
is oral dexamethasone 8 mg (or equivalent dose of another corticosteroid) to be administeredat 
12hours, 3 hours, and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion, however other corticosteroids and/or 
schedules and routes of administration are also acceptable according to local standards. Antiemetic 
premedication will be administered according to local standards. 
If one of the study drugs is discontinued, the other study drug may be continued for the remainder 
of the cycles. 
Participants should be carefully monitored for infusion reactions during nivolumab and docetaxel 
administration. If an acute infusion reaction is noted, participants should be managed according to Section7.4.6 and Section 7.4.7.
7.2 B linding 
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04. Due to lack of rPFS and OS benefit from 
nivolumab added to docetaxel plus prednisone compared to placebo added to docetaxel plus prednisone, on 26-Jul-2023 a BMS EOC decided to terminate the study. The decision to 
terminate the study was not based on any s afety concerns or issues. Full study teams and 
investigators were unblinded to study treatment assignment on 03-Aug-2023.
Blinding of treatment assignment is critical to the integrity of this clinical study. However, in the 
event of a medical emergency or pregnancy in an individual participant in which knowledge of the 
investigational product is critical to the parti cipant's management, the blind for that participant 
may be broken by the investigator. The participant’s safety takes priority over any other considerations in determining if a treatment assignment should be unblinded.

Before breaking the blind of an individual participant's treatm ent, the invest igator should 
determine that the unblinded informat ion is necessary , ie, that it will alter the participant's 
immediate m anagement. In many  cases, parti cularly  when the em ergency  is clearly not rel ated to 
the investigational product, the problem may be properly managed by assuming that the participant 
is receiving act ive product. It is highly desirable that the decision to unblind treatment assignment 
be discussed wi th the Medical Monitor, but the investigator always has ul timate authori ty for the 
decisio n to unblind. The actual  TASK of unblinding can be delegated by the invest igator to a 
designee assigned the task on the Delegat ion of Authority. The Principal Invest igator o r appointed 
designee shoul d only call in for emergency unblinding AFTER the decisio n to unblind the 
participant has been documented .
For this study , the method of unblinding for emergency purposes is through the IRT. For 
inform ation on how to unblind for e mergency, please consult the IRT manual.
In cases of accidental  unblinding, contact the Medical Moni tor and ensure every  attem pt is made 
to preserve the blind. Any request to unblind a participant for non -emergency purposes shoul d be 
discussed with the Medical Moni tor.Scient ist in the Bioanaly tical Science departm ent of BMS 
(and/or a designee in the external bioanalyt ical laboratory ) will be unblinded to th e rando mized 
treatm ent assignments in order to minimize unnecessary  bioanaly tical analysis of samples . Any 
resul ts shared by the Bioana lytical Science group with the s ponsor’s study  team  will be blinded to 
ensure integrity of the study .The independent central  review is blinded to the study  therap y 
administrated as well.
7.3 Method of Treatment Assignment
Allparticipants will be centrally randomized using an Interacti ve Response Techno logy (IRT). 
Before the study  is initiated, each user will receive log in informat ion and directions on how to 
access the IRT.
Study  treatm ent will be dispensed at the study visi ts as listed in Section2(Schedule o f Act ivities).
Within each panel, participants will be rando mized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Docetaxel  + 
Nivo lumab arm (Arm A) or Docetaxel + Placebo arm (Arm B) according to a computer -generated 
rando mizat ion scheme prepared by a Rando mization Coordi nator within the Drug Supply 
Management Department of BMS Research and Development. Randomization will be stratified 
by the fo llowing factors:
1 prior Novel Ant iandrogen Therapy ( NAT) for mCRPC vs 1 prior NAT for nmCRPC/mCSPC 
vs 2 prior NAT
Visceral  disease (Y vs N)
Visceral  disease status will be assessed by invest igator based on the tum or assessment perform ed 
during screening. Visceral disease is defined as the presence of metastati c disease in the liver, lung, 
adrenal, peritoneum, brain or other internal organs. Bone,lymph node metastases and prostate 
lesions(or bladder/rectum if from  direct invasio n from prostate) are not considered viscera l 
disease .

If prednisone or predni solone is stopped, the participant will continue docetaxel  treatm ent in the 
absence ofmajor toxicity, disease progressi on or any other discont inuat ion criteria as defined in 
Section
8.
7.4.3 Dose Delay Criteria
Dose del ay cri teria apply for all drug -related AEs regardl ess of  whether the event is attributed to 
nivolumab /placebo or docetaxel or both. Delay administrati on of both nivolumab /placebo and 
docetaxel if any of the delay criteria in Table 7.4-
1and Table 7.4-2are met. Dela y 
nivolumab /placebo and docetaxel  dosing for any adverse event, laboratory  abnormalit y, or 
intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of stud y 
medicat ion. Delay administrati on of all drugs if SARS -CoV -2 infect ion either confirmed or 
suspected. 
For participants who require delay  of nivolumab/placebo and docetaxel, re-evaluate weekly, or 
more frequent ly, if clinically  indicated and resume dosing when criteria to resum e treatm ent are 
met(see Section 7.4.4 ). Continue tumor assessments per protocol even if dosing is delayed.
If treatm ent is delayed > 8 weeks (Q3W cycle) or > 10 weeks (Q4W cycle), nivolumab/placebo
treatm ent must be permanently discont inued, except as specified in Section 8 . Prior to re -initiating 
treatm ent in a participant with a dosing delay last ing > 8 weeks (Q3W cycle) or > 10 weeks (Q4W 
cycle), the Medi cal Moni tor (or designee ) must be consul ted.

7.4.4 Criteria to Resume Study Treatment
Parti cipants may resume dosing when resuming criteria for BOTH nivolumab and docetaxel are 
met if they have completed AE management (ie,corticosteroi d taper) or are on ≤ 10 mg prednisone 
or equivalent, and meet the requirements per Table 7.4-1and Table 7.4-2. That is, nivolumab or 
placebo and docetaxel must be administered together until complet ion of Cycle 10 or until  one or 
both agents are discont inued. The only except ion is immune -related toxicities that require 
prolonged nivolumab delay (ie, toxicities treated with a prolonged corticosteroi d taper). In such 
cases, dosing with docetaxel  may resume prior to nivolumab, when the criteria to resum e dosing 
for docetaxel have been met. Nivo lumab or placebo dosing may be resumed later, after complet ion 
of the corticosteroi d taper and when criteria to resume nivolumab or placebo dosing have been 
met. It is allowed to administer either nivo lumab/placebo or docetaxel if the other is discont inued 
because of toxicity if, in the opinio n of the treating investigator, it is in the best interest of the 
participant .
Prior to re -initiating treatment in a participant with a dosing delay last ing > 8 weeks (Q3W cycle) 
or > 10 weeks (Q4W cycle), the Medical Monitor (or designee ) must be consulted. Continue tumor 
assessments per protocol ev en if dosing is delayed. Continue periodic study  visits to assess safet y 
and laboratory  studi es asclinically indicated during such dosing delays. 
Parti cipants wit
h SARS -CoV -2 infect ion (either confirmed or suspected) may resume treatm ent 
after all of thefollowing criteria are met: 1) at least 10 days (20 days for severe/crit ical illness) 
have passed since symptom s first appe ared or posit ive test result (eg,RT-PCR or viral antigen) ;
2) resol ution of  acute symptom s (including at least 24 hours have passed since last fever wi thout 
fever -reducing medicat ions);3) evaluat ion by the i nvestigator with confirmat ion that there are no 
sequelae that would place the participant at a higher risk of receiving invest igational treatm ent;
and 4) consul tation with the Medi cal Monitor. For suspected cases, treatm ent m ay also resum e if 
SARS -CoV -2 infect ion is ruled -out and other cri teria to resum e treatm ent are m et.
7.4.5 Management Algorithms for Nivolumab 
Immuno-oncol ogy (IO) agents are associ ated with AEs that can diffe r in severi ty and durat ion 
from AEs caused by other therapeuti c classes. Nivo lumab is considered an IO agent ,and the 
management algorithms in Appendix 6 provide guidance on assessing and managing the fo llowing 
groups of AEs :
Gastrointestinal
Renal
Pulmo nary
Hepati c
Endocrinopathy
Skin
Neurol ogical
Myocardi tis

7.4.6 Treatment of Related Infusion Reactions
Since nivolumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequences, it is unlikely to be 
immunogenic and induce infusio n or hy persensi tivity react ions. Howev er, if such a reacti on were 
to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruri tus, arthralgias, 
hypotension, hypertensio n, bronchospasm, or other allergic -like react ions. Report all Grade 3 or 4 
infusio n reactions as SAEs (if the y meet the criteri a) wi thin 24 hours of onset . 
Treatment recommendations are provided below based on National Cancer Institute Commo n 
Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) versio n 5. Grading definit ions and may 
be modified based on local tre atment standards and guidelines, as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptoms (mild reacti on; infusio n interruption not indicated; intervent ion not 
indicated):
Remain at bedside and monitor participant until recovery  from symptom s. The following
prophylact ic prem edicat ions are recommended for future infusio ns: diphenhydramine 
50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 m g at l east 30 minutes before 
additional nivo lumab administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms: (Therapy  or infusio n interruption indicated but responds prom ptly to
symptom atic treatm ent (eg, antihistamines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs [NSAIDS ], 
narcoti cs, IV fluids); prophylact ic medicat ions indicated for ≤ 24 hrs ):
Stop the study  drug infusio n, begin an IV infusio n of norm al saline, and treat the participant 
with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamo l 325 to 
1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor participant until resolution of symptom s. 
Corti costeroi d and/or bronchodilator therapy  mayalso be administered as appropriate. If the 
infusio n is interrupted, then restart the infusio n at 50% of the original infusio n rate when 
symptoms resolve; if no further complicat ions ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be 
increased to 100% of the origina l infusio n rate. Monitor participant closely. If symptoms recur, 
then no further study  medicat ion will be administered at that visit.
For future infusio ns, the following prophylacti c prem edicat ions are recommended:
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamo l 325 to 1000 mg 
administered at least 30 minutes before nivolumab infusions. If necessary , corti costeroi ds (up 
to 25 m g of hydrocorti sone or equivalent) may be used.
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms : (severe reacti on, Grade 3: Prol onged (eg , not rapi dly responsive to 
symptom atic medicat ion and/or brief interruption of infusion); recurrence of symptoms fo llowing 
initial improvement; hospi talizati on indicated for clinical sequelae. Grade 4: Life-threatening 
consequences; urgent interven tion indicated):
Immediately discont inue infusio n of study drug. Begin an IV infusio n of normal  saline and 
treat the participant as follows: Recommend bronchodilators: epinephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 
1:1000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a  1:10,000 solution 
injected slowly for IV administrati on; and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with 
methylpredniso lone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Monitor participant until the

investi gator judges that the symptom s will not recur. Study  drug will be permanent ly 
discontinued. Follow institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at 
bedside and mo nitor parti cipant until  symptoms resolve .
In case of late-occurring hypersensit ivity symptoms (eg, appearance oflocalized or generalized 
pruri tus within 1 week after treatm ent), symptomat ic treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids) .
7.4.7 Docetaxel -related Hypersensitivity Reactions
Patients shoul d be observed closely for hypersensit ivity react ions especially  during the first and 
second infusio ns. Hypersensit ivity reacti ons may occur within a few minutes following the 
initiation of the infusion of docetaxel , thus facilities for the treatm ent of hypotension and 
bronchospasm shoul d be available. If hypersensit ivity reacti ons occur, minor symptom s such as 
flushing or l ocalized cutaneous reacti ons do not requi re interrupti on of  therapy. However, severe 
reacti ons ( ≥ Grade 3), such as severe hypotension, bronchospasm or generalized rash/ery thema 
requi re immediate discont inuat ion of docetaxel  and appropri ate therapy . Patients who have 
developed severe hypersensit ivity react ions should not be re-challenged with docetaxel . Pati ents 
who have previ ously experienced a hypersensit ivity reaction to paclitaxel may be at risk to develop 
hypersensit ivity react ion to docetaxel, including more severe hypersensit ivity react ion. These 
patients shoul d be cl osely m onitored during ini tiation of docetaxel therapy.
7.5 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
The invest igational product shoul dbe stored in a secure area according to local regulat ions. It is 
the responsibilit y of the investigator to ensure that invest igational product is only dispensed to 
study  Parti cipants. The invest igational product must be dispensed only fro m official study sites by 
authori zed personnel according to local regulat ions.
The product storage manager shoul d ensure that th e study  treatm entis stored in accordance with 
the environmental condi tions (temperature, light, and humidit y) as determined by BMS. If 
concerns regarding the qualit y or appearance of the study  treatm entarise, the study treatm ent
shoul d not be di spensed and contact BMS immediately.
Study  treatm entnot supplied by BMS will be stored in accordance with the package insert.
Invest igational product doc umentation (whether supplied by BMS or not) must be maintained that 
includes all processes requi red to ensure drug is accurately administered. This includes 
docum entati on of drug storage, administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures,

7.7 Concomitant Therapy
Drug -drug interacti ons (DDI) between nivolumab and co-administered medications are unlikely. 
See the recent nivo lumab IB for information concerning DDI studies conducted with nivo lumab.
7.7.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments
7.7.1.1 All Participants
For both treatm ent arm s, the following medicat ions are prohibited during the study (unless utilized 
to treat a drug -related AE):
Immunosuppressive agents and immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (e xcept 
as stated in Sect ion 7.7.2 ) are prohibited during the treatment with nivo lumab
Any concurrent non-protocol -specified anti-neoplastic therapy  (ie, chem otherapy , horm onal 
therapy other than ADT, immunotherapy, extensive, non -palliat ive radiat ion therapy, standard 
or investigational agents for treatment of mCRPC)
Any non -palliat ive radiat ion therapy (unless specified per protocol). Limited radiat ion therap y 
administered with palliative intent (ie,for pain,  bleeding, spinal cord compressio n, brain 
metastasis, new or impending patho logic fracture, superior vena-cava syndro me, or 
obstructi on) is permi tted  
Any complementary  medicat ions (eg,herbal supplements or traditional Chines e medicines) 
intended to treat the disease under study . Such medicat ions are permitted if they are used as 
supportive care .
Any live/attenuated vaccine (eg,varicella, zoster, yellow fever, rotavirus, oral polio and 
measles, mumps, rubella [MMR ]) during t reatment and unt il 100 days post last dose .
Initiation or dose adjust ment of approved bone targeting agents is prohibited within 28 days 
prior to start of study  treatm ent. Init iation of these agents is allowed during study treatment, if 
clinically indicated, and should not result in study  treatm ent discont inuat ion.
7.7.1.2 Nivolumab Combined with Docetaxel
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers shoul d be avoided during the treatment with docetaxel . 
Please refer to Appendix 7 for a list of commo n strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers.

contrast regimen per imaging study . Imaging contraindicat ions and contrast risks are to be 
considered in this assessment. Participants with renal insufficiency are to be assessed as to whether 
or not they should receive contrast and if so, which contrast a gent and dose is appropriate. Specific 
to MRI, participants with severe renal insufficiency (ie, estimated glomerular filtrat ion rate (eGFR) 
< 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) are at increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, therefore MRI 
contrast is contraindica ted. In addition, participants may be excluded from MRI if they have 
tattoos, metallic implants, pacemakers, etc. This will be outlined in the image acquisit ion manual.
Gent le hydrat ion before and after IV contrast should follow local standard of care. Theultimate 
decisio n to perform MRI in an individual partici pant in this study  rests with the site radiologist, 
the invest igator, and standards set by  the l ocal Ethics Committee.
7.7.2 Permitted Therapy
Parti cipants are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalat ional 
corticosteroi ds (with minimal systemic absorpti on). Adrenal replacement steroi d doses > 10 mg 
daily  predniso ne are permitted. A brief (less than 3weeks) course of corticosteroi ds for 
prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye al lergy ) or for treatm ent of non-autoimmune condit ions (eg, delayed -
type hypersensit ivity reacti on caused by a contact allergen) is permitted.
7.7.3 Palliative Local Therapy 
Palliat ive local therapy, including palliat ive radiotherapy  and palliat ive surgical resec tion, to 
symptom atic tumor lesions is permi tted. Parti cipants requi ring palliat ive local therapy shoul d be 
evaluated (by CT/MRI and bone scan if clinically  indicated) for objective evidence of disease 
progression prior to the init iation of such therapy, pa rticularly if the most recent tumor assessment 
was more than 4 weeks prior to th e planned start of local therapy. If progression per PCWG3 is 
ident ified prior to the init iation of palliat ive local therapy, then participants must either discont inue 
study  treatm ent or they must meet criteria to continue treatm ent beyo nd progression (Secti on7.7.4 )
in order to resume study  treatm ent af ter the com pletion of  palliat ive local therapy.
In cases where palliat ive radiotherapy is required, nivo lumab dosing should be withheld for at least 
1 week before, during, and 1 week after radiotherapy. Participants sh ould be closely mo nitored for 
any potential  toxicity during and after receiving radiotherapy , and AEs shoul d resolved to 
Grade 1 prior to resuming nivo lumab.
For docetaxel local standard of care guidelines should be fo llowed. 
7.7.4 Treatment Beyond Progressio n 
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04.
Parti cipants will be permitted to conti nue treatment beyo nd initial PCWG3 -defined PD, as 
assessed by the invest igator ,up to a maximum of 24 months from date of first dose , as long as the 
following criteria are considered:
Invest igator -assessed clinical benefit

Participant provi des wri tten informed consent prior to receiving addit ional treatm ent wi th the 
study  drug regimen. All other elements of the main consent including descript ion of reasonably 
foreseeable risks or disco mforts, or other alternative treatment op tions will st ill apply .
7.7.5 Re-assessment Following Initial Assessment of Progression
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04.Radiographic tumor assessments by BICR 
following PCWG3 criteria will no longer apply. All participants receiving study treatment 
will have radiographic tumor assessments based on the clinical judgment of the treating 
investigator and following local imaging tumor assessment guidelines for mCRPC. 
Submission of tumor imaging assessments for central review will no longer apply.
Radiographic assessment/scan(s) shoul d continue in accordance with Section 2(Schedule of 
Activities)for the durati on of the treatment beyond progressi on and shoul d be submi tted to the 
central  imaging vendor. This assessment will allow determinat ion of whether there has been a 
decrease in the tumor size or continued PD. The assessment of clinical benefit should be balanced 
by clinical jud gment as to whether the participant is clinically deteriorating and unlikely to receive 
any benefit from cont inued treatment with nivo lumab.
For the participants who continue study therapy beyo nd progression, further progression is defined
as fo llows: 
Further disease progression of soft tissue is defined as an addit ional 10% increase in tumor burden 
with a minimum  5 mm absol ute increase from  time of  initial PD. Thi s includes an increase in the 
sum of diameters of all target lesio ns and/ or the diameters of new measurable lesio nscompared to 
the time o f initial PD.
New l esions are considered m easurable at the time of init ial progression if the lo ngest di ameter is 
at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes ,which must have a short axis of at least
15mm). Any new lesio n considered non -measurable at the time of init ial progressio n may beco me 
measurable and therefore included in the tumor burden if the longest diameter increases to at least 
10 mm  (except for pathol ogical lymph nodes ,which must have a sh ort axis of at least 15 mm). In 
situations where the relative increase in total tumor burden by 10% is solely due toinclusio n of 
new lesions ,which become measurable, these new lesio ns m ust dem onstrate an absolute increase 
of at least 5 mm.
Further bone d isease progressi on is defined as addi tional two or m ore new bone lesio ns noted on
bone scans co mpared to the time of PCWG3 -defined progression of bone disease.
Study  treatm ent should be discont inued perm anent ly upon docum entati on of any further 
progression as described above .Confirmed PSA progression alone is not necessarily a n indicat ion 
to stop treatment.

7.8 Treatment After the End of the Study
Per Protocol Amendment 04, due to lack of rPFS benefit at the final analysis and OS benefit 
at the first interim analysis for nivolumab added to docetaxel plus prednisone compared to 
placebo added to docetaxel plus prednisone, on 26-Jul -2023, a BMS EOC decided to 
terminate the study. The decision to terminate the study was not based on any safety 
concerns or issues. Based on these results, BMS recommends discontinuation of nivolumab 
in all participants receiving this study treatment. In the event that the investigator deems a 
participant is deriving clinical benefit from nivolumab therapy and, together with the 
counse led participant, wishes to continue nivolumab, this may be allowed following 
discussion with the Medical Monitor to ensure a clinical rationale exists that justifies 
continuation of nivolumab treatment. 
Study  treatm ent will be provided via an extensio n ofthe study, a rollo ver study requiring approval 
by responsible health authori ty and ethics committee or through another mechanism at the 
discreti on of  BMS.
BMS reserves the right to terminate access to BMS supplied study treatm ent if any of the fo llowing 
occur: a) the study  is terminated due to safety concerns; b) devel opment is terminated for other 
reasons, including but not limit ed to lack of efficacy and/or not meeting the study objectives; c) the 
participant can obtain medication from a government spons ored or private healt h program. In all 
cases BMS will fo llow l ocal regulat ions.
8 DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA
8.1 Discontinuation from Study Treatmen t
Parti cipants MUST discont inue invest igational product (and non-invest igational product at the 
discreti on of  the in vestigator) for any o f the following reasons:
Parti cipant’s request to stop study treatm ent.Participants who request to discontinue study 
treatm ent will remain in the study  and must continue to be followed for proto col-specified 
follow-up procedures. The only excepti on to this is when a participant specifically wit hdraws 
consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously authorized by participant to 
provi de thi s informat ion
Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory  abnormalit y or intercur rent illness which, in the 
opinio n of the invest igator, indicates that continued participat ion in the study is not in the best 
interest of the participant
Terminat ion of the study by Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS) for reasons including but not limited 
to the f ollowing: safet y concerns, terminat ion of drug development, l ack of  efficacy, and lack
of meeting study  object ives/endpo ints.
Loss of ability to freely  provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily incarceration 
for treatm ent of either a psychiatri c or physical (eg, infect ious disease) illness . (Note: Under 
specific circumstances and only in countries where local regulat ions permit , a participant who 
has been imprisoned may be permitted to continue as a participant. Strict condit ions apply and 
BMS approval  is requi red.)

Parti cipant meets criteria for radiographic progressio n per PCWG3 criteria (as defined in 
Appendix 5) unless criteria for treatm ent beyo nd progression have been met (see 
Secti on7.7.4 ).PSA progression alone is not an indicat ion to discont inue study  treatm ent (see 
Secti on9.1.2 ).
Refer to Section 2(Schedule of Activities)for data to be collected at the time of treatment 
discontinuat ion and fo llow-up and for any  further evaluat ions that can be completed .
All participant s who discont inue study  treatm entshoul d comply with protoc ol-specified follow-
up procedures as outlined in Secti on 2 (Schedule of Activities). The only except ion to this 
requi rement is when a participant withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post-
treatm ent study  follow-up or l oses the abili ty to consent freely ( ie, is imprisoned or invol untarily 
incarcerated for the treatment of either a psychiatric or phy sical illness).
If study  treatm entis discontinued prior to the participant ’s co mpletion of the study , the reason for 
the discont inuat ion must be docum ented in the participant ’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate case report f orm (CRF) page.
8.1.1 Discontinuation of Specific Study Treatments
The assessment for discont inuat ion of nivolumab and docetaxel  should be made separately for 
each study  drug. Although there is overlap among the discont inuat ion criteria, if discontinuat ion 
criteria are met for one study  treatm ent but not the other, it may be acceptable to continue t reatm ent 
with the study  treatm ent that is not felt to be related to the toxici ty. If the invest igator considers 
the toxi city to be related to both study  treatm ents or is unable to determine which study  treatm ent 
is the cause of toxicity, then both study  treatments shoul d be discont inued, and the 
recommendat ions for management of toxicit y related to both study treatments should be prompt ly 
initiated.
Nivo lumab and/or docetaxel treatment must be permanent ly discont inued per criteria in Table 7.4-
1and Table 7.4-2.
Discontinue nivolumab and/ordocetaxel for any adverse event, laboratory  abnorm ality, or 
intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the investigator, presents a substant ial clinical risk 
tothe parti cipant wi th cont inued nivolumab and/or docetaxel dosing. 
Any event that leads to delay in dosing last ing > 8 weeks (Q3W cycle) or > 10 weeks (Q4W cycle),

8.1.2 Post Study Treatment -Study Follow -up
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04. Only participants who received study provided 
nivolumab and areup to100 days after theirlast nivolumab infusion will have post-study 
treatment safety follow -up. After completion of the 100-day safety follow -up requirement 
and resolution or stabilization of AEs, nivolumab -treated participants will be discontinued 
from the study. All other participants currently on safety or survival follow -up with 
resolution or stabilization of AEs will be discontinued from the study. 
In this study , overall survival is a key endpo int of the study . Post study  follow
-up is of critical 
importance and is essential to preserving participant safet yand the integrity of the study . 
Parti cipants who discont inue study  treatment must continue to be followed (in this study  or a 
rollover study )for collect ion of outcom e and/or survival follow-up data as required and in line 
with Secti on 5until death or the conclusio n of the study .
BMS may request th at survival data be collected forall treated participants outsi de the protocol -
defined window (as detailed in the Schedule of Activit ies in Section 2). At the time of this request, 
each participant will be contacted to determine his or her survi val status ,unless the participant has 
withdrawn consent for all contact or is lost tofollow
-up.
8.2 Discontinuation from the Study
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04. Only participants continuing study -provided 
nivolumab and areup to100 days after theirlast nivolumab infusion will have post-study 
treatment safety follow -up. After completion of the 100-day safety follow -up requirement 
and resolution or stabilization of AEs, nivolumab -treated participants will be discontinued 
from the study. All other participants currently on safety or survival follow -up with 
resolution or stabilization of AEs will be discontinued from the study. 
Parti cipants who request to discont inue study  treatment will remain in the study and must conti nue 
to be followed for protocol -specified follow
-up procedures. The only  except ion to thi s is when a 
participant specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons 
previously authorized by participant to provi de this informat ion. 
Parti cipants shoul d notify  the investigator of the decisio n to withdraw consent from future 
follow-up in writing, whenever possible.
The withdrawal  of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the 
investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is from further treatm ent wi th study  treatm entonly 
or also from study  procedures and/or post treatment study  follow-up, and entered on the 
appropriate CRF page.
In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, 
publicly  available informat ion shoul d be used to determine vital status only as appropri ately 
directed in accordance with local law.
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future informat ion, the sponsor may 
retain and cont inue to use any data collected befor e such a withdrawal o f consent.

Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood count) 
and obtained before signing of inform ed consent may be utilized for screening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol -defined criteria and has been performed 
within the t imeframe defined i n the S chedule of Activit ies.
Perform  additional measures, including non-study  required laboratory  tests, as clinically 
indicated or to comply with local regulations. Laboratory  toxicities (eg, suspected drug-
induced liver enzyme evaluat ions) will be monitored during the follow-up phase via on-
site/local labs until all study drug-related toxi cities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed 
irreversible.
Evaluate participant immediately to rule out cardiac or pulmonary toxicit y if participant shows 
cardiac or pulmo nary-related signs (hypoxia, abnorm al heart rate,or changes from baseline) 
or symptoms (eg ,dyspnea, cough, chest pain, fat igue, palpitat ions).
Some of the assessments referred to in this section may not be captured as data in the eCRF. 
They  are intended to be used as safet y monitoring by the treating physician. Addit ional testing

local regulati ons.
9.1 Efficacy Assessments
9.1.1 Imaging Assessment for the Stu dy
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04:Radiographic tumor assessments by BICR 
following PCWG3 criteria will no longer apply. Moving forward from Protocol Amendment 
04, all participants receiving study treatment will have radiographic tumor assessments 
based on the clinical judgment of the treating investigator and following local imaging tumor 
assessment guidelines for mCRPC. Submission of tumor imaging assessments for central 
review will no longer apply.   
Images will be submitted to a central imaging vendor for BICR during the study. Prior to scanning 
first participant, sites shoul d be qualified and understand the image acquisit ion guidelines and 
submissio n process as outlined in the CA2097DX Imaging Manual provided by the central 
imaging.
Screening and on study  images shoul d be acquired as outlined in Secti on2(Schedule of Activit ies).
Tumor assessments at other timepoints may be performed if clinically  indicated and shoul d be 
submitted to the central imaging vendor as soon as possible. Unscheduled bone scans, CT/MRI 
shoul d be submi tted to central imaging vendor. X-rays that clearly demonstrate interval 
progression of disease, for example most commo nly as unequivocal  lesions that are unmistakably 
new since the prior CT/MRI, should be submitted to central imaging vendor. Otherwise, they do 
not need to b e submitted centrally .

9.1.1.1 Methods of Measurement
Bone lesio ns, including those wi th soft tissue component, will be assessed using t echnetium -99m 
(Tc-99m) based radionuclide bone scans. 
Contrast -enhanced CT of the, chest, abdom en, pelvis, and all other known and/or suspected si tes 
of disease shoul d be perform ed for tumor assessme nts. Bone lesions, including those with or 
without a soft tissue component, will be assessed by radionuclide bone scans and not by CT or 
MRI. Images shoul d be acquired with slice thick ness of 5 mm or less with no intervening gap 
(conti guous). Every  attempt shoul d be made to image each participant using an ident ical 
acquisit ion protocol on the same scanner for all imaging timepo ints. Tum or measurements shoul d 
be made by the same invest igator or radi ologist for each assessment, whenever possible. Change 
in tumor measurements and tumor response to guide ongoing study  treatment decisions will be 
assessed by  the invest igator using the PCWG3 criteria.
If a participant has a contraindicat ion for CT intravenous contrast, then a non-contrast CT of  the 
chest and a contrast -enhanced MRI of the abdomen, pelvis, and other known/suspected sites of 
disease shoul d be obtained. 
If a participant has a co ntraindicat ion for both MR and CT intravenous contra sts, then a no ncontrast 
CT of  the chest and a non -contrast MRI of the abdom en, pelvis, and other known/suspected si tes 
of disease shoul d be obtained. 
If a participant has a contraindicat ion for MRI (eg, incompatible pacemaker) in addition to 
contraindicat ion to CT intravenous contrast, then a non -contrast CT of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, 
and other known/suspected sites of disease is acceptable.
MRI of brain (without and with contrast) should be acquired as outlined in Section 2(Schedule of 
Activities). CT of the Brain (without and with contrast) can be performed if MRI is 
contraindicated.
9.1.1.2 Imaging and Clinical Assessment
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04 :Radiographic tumor assessments will no longer 
apply. Moving forward from protocol Amendment 04, all participants receiving study 
treatment will have radiographic tumor assessments based on the clinical judgment of the 
treating investigator and following local imaging tumor assessment guidelines for mCRPC. 
Submission of tumor imaging assessments for central review will no longer apply.
Tumor assessments shoul d continue even if dosing is delayed or di scont inued. Changes in tumor 
measurements and tumor responses will be assessed by the same investigator or designee using 
PCWG3 criteria. Assessments of PR and CR must be confirmed at least 4 weeks (28 days) after 
initial response. A Best Overall  Response (BOR) of SD requi res a minimum o f 56days on study 
from date of first dose to the date of the first imaging assessment .

imaging assessments for central review will no longer apply.
Sites shoul d submit all scans to the central imaging vendor on a rolling basis, throughout the 
durati on of the study. BICR of scans will occur on a rolling basis, blinded to treatm ent arm, clinica l 
data, and invest igator assessment of submi tted scans. When progressi on per PCWG3 criteria is 
assessed by the invest igator, the site will infor m the central  imaging vendor, in order for BICR 
assessment of progression to be performed. The BICR will be completed and the results provided 
to the site as specified in the imaging vendor documents, provided there are no pending imaging 
queri es to the site. All details on the timelines and associated process requirements will be outlined 
in the Imaging Manual.
Parti cipants whose progression is not confirmed by the BICR will be requi red to continue tumor 
assessments (if clinically feasible) according to the protocol -specified schedule, or sooner if 
clinically indicated. Also, if participants discont inue treatm ent without radiographic progression, 
tumor assessments will continue according to the protocol -specified schedule, as noted in 
Secti on2(Schedule of Activities) until progressi on has been confirmed by BICR. Incase 
subsequent therapy  has begun, imaging must continue unt il radiographic progressi on per PCWG3

Disease progression by PSA (PSA Progression): For participants with an initial PSA decline
from baseline, the date of PSA progressi on is the date that an increase of 25% or more and an 
absolute increase of 2 ng/mL or more from the nadir are docum ented and confirmed by a second 
consecut ive PSA value at least 3 weeks later . For parti cipants with no PSA decline fro m baseline, 
the date of  PSA progressi on is the date that an increase of 25% or m ore and an absol ute increase 
of 2 ng/mL or m ore from baseline are documented at or bey ond Week 13.
PSA progression alo ne is not an indicat ion to stop treatm ent. Rather, participants must discont inue 
study  treatm ent upon radiographic progressi on cri teria per PCWG3 for measurable disease and/or 
bone disease (Table 9.1.2 -1above). Participantswho discont inue treatm ent without PSA 
progression or radiographic progressi on will continue to have PSA at FU1, FU2,and every 12

Not applicable per Pro tocol Amendment 04. 
The evaluat ion of patient-reported outcom es is an increasingly important aspect of clinical efficac y 
in onco logy trials. Such data provide an understanding of the impact of treatment from the 
participant’s perspect ive and offer insight s into patient experience that may not be captured

use as a visual aid during telephone interviews. See Secti on 2(Schedule of Activit ies) for more 
inform ation on timing of assessments. If exceptional circumstances precl ude the continued 
administration of measures using planned modaliti es, alternate admi nistrati on methods may be 
requi red .
9.1.4 The Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04. 
The BPI -SF103measures both pain severit y and funct ional interference caused by pain through the 
use of a numerical rating scale. Participant s rate the severit y of their pain at its “worst,” “least,” 
and “average” in the last 24 hours using an 11-point numerical rating scale with anchors of “no 
pain” and “pain as bad as you can imagine.” They are also asked to rate their pain at the time they 
complete the BPI -SF. Using an 11 point numerical rating scale with anchors of “does not interfere” 
and “completely interferes,” the BPI-SF similarly assesses to what extent pain interferes with 
mood, walking, general activity, work, relations with others, sleep, and enjoyment of life. The 
BPI-SF also asks participants to mark the location of  their pain on a body drawing and includes 
additional quest ions regarding pain treatment and the extent of pain relief. The original instrument 
on which the BPI-SF is based, The Wisconsin Brief Pain Quest ionnaire, was developed and 
validated in oncology patients with the fo llowing four tumor types: breast, prostate, colorectal, and 
gyneco logical.104The BPI-SF has been validated in cancer patients in several countri es with 
psycho metrically validated translat ions in over 25 countries .
9.1.5 The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy 
-Prostate Cancer 
(FACT -P)
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04. 
The FACT -P is a multidimensio nal, self-report instrument specifically designed for use with 
prostate cancer patients.105The FACT -P includes the 27-item FACT -General (FACT -G), a generic 
cancer -related core, to assess physical well-being (PWB; seven items), social/family  well-being 
(SWB; seven items), emotional well-being (EWB; six items), and functional well-being (FWB; 
seven items). In addition, the FACT -P includes a 12-item disease- specific Prostate Cancer 
Subscale that assesses prostate -related symptoms. Each of the 39 items is rated on a 0 (Not at all) 
to 4 (Very  much) Likert -type scale, then co mbined to produce subscale scores for each domain, a 
Trial Outcom e Index (TOI) based on the Physical and Functi onal well-being scales and the PCS 
as well as a total score which ranges fro m 0 to 156. Higher scores represent better QoL. The FACT -
P uses a recall period of the past 7 day s.

The EQ-5D- 5L is a standardized instrument used to measure self-reports of general healt h 
status.106The instrum ent has two c omponents, a descript ive system , and a visual analogue scale 
(VAS). The descript ive system  consists of 5dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, 
pain/disco mfort, and anxiety /depressi on. Each dimensi on has five levels, re flecting no probl ems, 
slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme probl ems. A dimensio n for 
which there are no problems is said to be at level 1, while a dimensio n for which there are extreme 
probl ems is said to be at level 5. Thus, th e vectors 11111 and 55555 represent the best healt h state 
and the worst health state, respectively. Altogether, the instrument describes 3,125 different healt h 
states. Em pirically -derived weights can be applied to an individual’s responses to the EQ-5D- 5L 
descript ive system  to generate a utility index measuring the value to society of his or her current 
healt h.107
The EQ -5D- 5L VAS allows parti cipants to rate th eir own current heal th on a 0to100 point scale 
ranging from “the worst health you can imagine” to the “best healt h you can imagine,” 
respectively .
The EQ -5D- 5L uses a recall period of “today .”
9.2 Adverse Events
Per Protocol Amendment 04, AE assessments will only be applicable to participants 
continuing study -provided nivolumab, and participants up to 100 days after their last 
infusion of nivolumab. After completion of the 100-day safety follow -up requirement and 
resolution or stabilization of AEs, nivolumab -treated participants will be discontinued from 
the study. All other participants will be discontinued from the study.
The definit ions of  an AE or seri ous adverse event (SAE) are classified according to NCI CTCAE 
versio n 5 and can be found in 
Appendix 3.
AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legally  authori zed representative). 
The invest igator and any designees are responsible for detecting, docum enting, and reporting 
events that meet the definit ion of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that 
are serio us, considered related to the study treatment or the study, or that caused the participant to 
discontinue before complet ing the study. 
Immune
-mediated adverse events are AEs consistent with an immune -mediated mechanism or 
immune -mediated component for which non-inflammatory  etiologies (eg, infect ion or tumor 
progression) have been ruled out. IMAEs can include events with an alternate etio logy which were 
exacerbated by the induction of autoimmunit y. Inform ation supporting the assessment will be 
collected on the parti cipant’s case report form.

The investigator must report any SAE that occurs af ter these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study  drug or protocol -specified procedure, (eg, a follow-up skin biopsy ), Medical 
occurrences that begin before the start of study treatm ent but after obtaining informed consent will 
be recorded on the appropri ate secti on of  the CRF module.
All SAEs wi ll be recorded and reported to sponsor or designee within 24 hours , as indicated in 
Appendix 3.
The invest igator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours
ofupdated informat ion being available.
All nonserious AEs (not only those deemed to be treatm ent-related) shoul d be collected 
continuously during the treatm ent period and for a minimum of 100 days fo llowing discont inuat ion 
of study  treatm ent.
All SAEs, and all AEs (SAEs and non serious AEs) asso ciated with confirmed or suspected SARS -
CoV -2 infect ion must be co llected fro m the date of the participant’s written consent unt il 100 days 
following discont inuat ion of dosing.
Invest igators 
are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study  participants. 
However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant 
has been discharged fro m the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study 
treatm ent or study  parti cipat ion, the invest igator must prompt ly notify the sponsor.
The method of evaluat ing, and assessing causality  of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/ transmi tting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3.
9.2.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended quest ioning, 
examinat ion, or evaluation of a participant . Care shoul d be taken not to introduce bias when 
collect ing AE and/or SAEs. Inqui ry about specific AEs sh ould be guided by clinical judgment in 
the context of known adverse events, when appropriate for the program or protocol.
Every  adverse event must be assessed by the investigator wit
h regard to whether it is considered 
immune -mediated. For events which are potenti ally immune -mediated, additional informat ion will 
be co llected on the participant’s case report form.
9.2.3 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
Nonserious AEs shoul d be followed to resol ution or stabilizat ion, or reported as SAEs if t hey

9.2.5 Pregnancy
Per Protocol Amendment 04,only applicable to female partner sof male participant s
continuing study -provided nivolumab, and female partner sof male participants up to100 
days after the irlast infusion of nivolumab. 
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study  participant should bereported to 
sponsor or designee. In order for sponsor or designee to collect any pregnancy  surveillance 
inform ation from the female partner, the female partner must sign an informed consent form for 
disclosure of this informat ion. Inform ation on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
In cases where a study  drug can be present in seminal fluid, at exposures sufficient to potenti ally 
cause fetal toxicit y, and if any sexual act ivity (eg, vaginal, anal, oral) has occurred between a male 
participant and a pregnant WOCBP partner(s), the informa tion shoul d 
be reported to the sponsor 
or designee, even if the male participant has undergone a succ

9.2.6 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
Per Protocol Amendment 04, only applicable to participants continuing study -provided 
nivolumab, and participants up to 100 days after theirlast infusion of nivolumab, as required 
in Table 2-2.
The following labora tory test resul t abnorm alities shoul d be captured on the nonseri ous AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form  electronic ,as appropri ate. Paper f orms are only intended as a back-up 
option when the el ectronic system is not functioning.
Any laboratory  test resul t that is clinically significant or meets the definit ion of an SAE 
Any laboratory  test resul t abnormalit y that required the participant to have study  treatm ent
discontinued or interrupted
Any laboratory  test resul t abnormalit y that required the participant to receive specific 
corrective therapy
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by the 
reporting invest igator ( eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
9.2.7 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Per Protocol Amendment 04, only applicable to participants continuing study -provided 
nivolumab, and participants up to 100 days after the irlast infusion of nivolumab.
Wherever possible, timely confi rmation of initial liver-related laboratory  abnormalit ies shoul d 
occu r prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meet ing 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Secti on 9.2.1 and Appendix 3 for reporting 
details) .
Potenti al drug induced liver injury  is defined as:
1)AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 Xupper limit of normal (ULN)
AND
2)Total  bilirubin > 2 XULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum  alkaline 
phosphatase),
AND
3)No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevat ion and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limi ted to, vi ral hepatitis, pre-exist ing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) know n to be hepatotoxic.

Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinat ions, electrocardiogram, 
x-ray filming, any other potenti al safet y assessment required or not required by protocol  should 
also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.
9.3 Overdose
Per Protocol Amendment 04, only applicable to participants continuing study -provided 
nivolumab, and participants up to 100 days after the irlast infusion of nivolumab.
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intent ional administration of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. Overdoses that meet the regulatory 
definit ion of SAE will be reported as an SAE (refer to Appendix 3).
All instances of accidental  overdose and/or dosing errors should be reported on the Dosage 
Administrati on Record eCRF.
There are a few reports of docetaxel overdose. There is no known ant idote for docetaxel overdose.
In case of overdose, the participant should be kept in a specialized unit and vital funct ions closely 
monitored. In cases of overdose, exacerbation of AEs may be expected. The primary anticipated 
complicat ions of overdose would consist of bone marrow suppression, peripheral neurotoxi city 
and mucosit is. Participants shoul d receive therapeuti c G-CSF as soon as possible after disco very 
of overdose. Other appropriate symptomat ic measures should be taken, as needed.
9.4 Safety

aIf a participant discontinues study drug treatment during the treatment/sampling period, they will move to sampling 
at the follow -up visits . See notes .
bPredose samples should be c ollected just before the administration of the drug (preferably within 30 minutes prior 
to the start of infusion ). If it is known that a dose is going to be delayed, then the predose sample should be collected 
just prior to the delayed dose. However, if a predose sample is collected but the dose is subsequently  delayed, an
additional predose sample should not be collected.
cSince the end of infu sion pharmacokinetic (EOI-PK) sample is drawn with the intent of accurately  estimating the 
maximum concentration (Cmax) of the drug, draw the EOI-PK sample when allofthe study drug has been infused. 
If the site infuses drug without a flush, then collect the EOI -PK sample within approximately 5 minutes after end 
of infusion. If a flush is administered to clear the IV lines of the drug and to ensure delivery of the enti re drug dose, 
then draw the EOI -PK sample within approximately 5 minutes after end of the flush. Do not draw EOI-PK samples 
from the same IV access through which that the drug was administered .
dIf combination therapy ends before 10 cycles, switch directly to the monotherapy phase sampling schedule starting

Sample Colle ction and Storage :
All requests for access to sam ples or data f or addi tional research will be vetted thro ugh a diverse 
committee of the s ponsor’s senior leaders in R&D to ensure the research supports appropriate and 
well-defined scient ific research act ivities. 
 
 
Samples kept for future research will be stored at the BMS Bioreposi tory in  USA or an 
independent, BMS -approved storage vendor.
The manager of  these samples will  ensure they  are properly  used throughout thei r usable life and 
will destroy  the samples at the end of the scheduled storage period, no longer than fifteen (15) 
years after the end of the study  or the maximum allowed by  applicable l aw.
Transfers of samples by research sponsor to third parties will be subject to the recipient’s 
agreem ent to establish similar storage procedures.
Samples will be stored in a coded fashion, and no researcher will have access to the key . The key 
is securely  held by  the invest igator at the clinical site, so there is no direct abilit y for a researcher 
to connect a sample to a specific individual.
Further details of sample collection and processing will be provi ded to th e site in the procedure

10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Sample Size Determination 
The primary  object ives of this study are to compare rPFS and OS between treatment groups in all 
rando mized participants. The primary endpo ints, rPFS and OS comprise the primary endpo int 
family and will be compared at the 0.01 level and 0.04 level respect ively, ensuring family -wise 
control  of the Type I error rate. These endpo ints will be tested separately and if significant, the 
alpha allocated to each endpoint will be recycled to the other endpoint. For example, if rPFS is

significant at the 0.01 level, then 0.01 will be transferred to the OS analysis for testing at 0.05 
level. Sample size est imation is conducted using EAST 6.4 and further verified in Solara .
Approximately  984 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Arm A and Arm B. Sample 
size i s calculated assuming exponential distribut ion for time -to-event endpoints. See Table 10.1-1
for a summary  of the sam ple size assumpt ions.
Sample size just ification for rPFS endpoint
The number of events was estimated assuming an exponent ial distribut ion of rPFS for the
Docetaxel arm (Arm  B) and a piecewise exponent ial distribut ion with a 2monthsdel ayed 
treatm ent effect for the Nivolumab + Docetaxel arm (Arm  A).Approximately  530 rPFS events , 
observed amo ng the 984randomized participants, provides 90% power to detect an average hazard 
ratio(HR) of 0. 67with a type 1 error of  0.01(two-sided). The average HR of 0. 67resul ted from 
an assumed targeted hazard ratio of 1
 for the initial 2months from rando mizat ion and a targeted 
hazard ratio of 0.58 for the time beyo nd 2-months fromrandomization . 
Sample size just ification for OS endpoint
The number of events was est imated assuming an exponent ial distribut ion of OSfor the Docetaxel 
arm (Arm B) and a piecewise exponent ial distributi on with a 3-month s delayed treatm ent effect  
for the Nivo lumab + Docetaxel arm (Arm A). Approximately 690 OS events, observed amo ng the 
984 rando mized partici pants, provi des 92% power to detect an average hazard ratio of 0. 76with a 
type 1 error of 0.04(two-sided). The average hazard ratio of 0.76resulted from an assumed 
targeted hazard rati o of 1 for the initial 3months from  randomizat ion and a targeted hazard rati o 
of 0.72for the time beyo nd 3-months from rando mizat ion. 
For all rando mized participants, two interim OS analyses are planned. The two interim OS analyses 
are planned at approximately 47% and 80% of the total events observed at final analysis, 
respectively . The first interim analysis will occur at the time of rPFS analysis .The stopping 
boundaries at the interim and final analyses will be bas ed on the actual number of OS events at the 
time of the analysis using Lan -DeMets alpha-spending funct ion with O’Br ien-Fleming boundaries , 
taking into account any alpha that was passed fro m the rPFS analysis (if applicable). Details o f the 
interim analysis will be included in 
Section 10.3.6 (Interim Analysis).
Assuming an average enrollment rate of2,20, 45,and 70participants randomized per month
during month
s 1to 7, 8to15, 1 6to 21,and 22to 29, respectively ,with a 29-month accrual period, 
it will take approximately 51months from the date of rando mizat ion of the first participant to 
observe the required number of events for OS analyses in all randomized popul ation. The number 
of events needed for the analyses will be monitored by the unblinded independent statistician 
supporting the IDMC.

OS is thetime from rando mization initiation tothedate
ofdeath fromanycause.The OS for all randomized participants will be 
compared using a stratified 2 -sided log rank test with 
adjusted alpha at each interim analysis and final 
analy sis (alpha will be recycled from r PFS to OS if 
rPFS test is significant) . The log -rank t est p-value will 
be reported. The hazar d ratio and the corresponding 2 -
sided (1 -adjusted alpha)*100% CI will be estimated in 
a stratified Cox proportional hazard model using the 
randomized arm as a single covariate.
The OS function for each treatment arm w ill be 
estimated using the KM product limit method and will 
be displayed graphically. A 2-sided 95% CI for median 
OS in each arm will be estimated via the log -log 
transformation method (primary comparison where up 
to 0.04 alpha will be spent). In addition, descriptive
estimate sfor 12-
months and 24 -months OS rate will be 
presented along with their associated 95% CIs.

10.3.5.1 BPI-SF
Time to Pain Progression
The participant ’s assessment of pain wit h BPI-SF Item  #3 (pain symptoms at thei r worst over the 
last 24hours) will form the basis forthe analysis of median time to pain progressi on.112Pain 
progression will be considered to have occurred ,114if an increase in the worst pain intensit y of 2 
points is observed fro m baseline and maintained over 2 consecut ive time periods. Parti cipants who 
die without a reported pain progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their 
death. Those who neither progress nordie will be censored at the time of their last BPI-SF 
assessment prior to subsequent therapy ,while those who neither die nor have any BPI-SF 
assessments after randomizat ion will be censored on the date of rando mizat ion.Time to pain 
progression for all rando mized participants will be summarized and plotted using the Kaplan -
Meier methodol ogy. Median values, along with two-sided 95% CIs will also be calculated. The 
rate of pain progression at select timepoints and corresponding 95% CIs will also be est imate d.
Change in Pain Intensity
The mean value of least pain (Item #4), average pain (Item #5), and current pain (Item #6), along 
with Item #3, will also be analyzed as a composite assessment of change in pain intensity.110
Summary  statistics at each assessment point will be provided for each treatment group. The mean 
change from baseline will also be reported at each post -baseline assessment point.
10.3.5.2 FACT -P
Time t o Deterioration in Cancer -Related Symptoms and Quality of Life
The analysis of FACT -P will be performed for the total  score and all subscales .Parti cipants who 
die without a reported deterioration will be considered to have deteri orated on the date of their 
death. Those who neither deteriorate nor die will be censored at the time of their last FACT -P 
assessment, while those who neither die nor have any FACT -P assessments after randomizat ion 
will be censored on the date of rando mizat ion.
Change in Cancer -Related Symptoms and Quality of Life
For FACT -P total scores and all subscales, summary  statistics at each assessment point will be

10.3.7 Interim Analyses 
The Stati stical Analysis Plan will further describe the planned interim analyses.
10.3.7.1 Interim Analysis for OS
For the rando mized popul ation, two interim OS analyses and one final analysis isplanned using 
an alpha of 0.04 if rPFS is not si gnificant and 0.05 if rPFS is significant (0.01 al pha passed). The 
two interim  OS analyses are planned at appro ximately 47% and 80% of  the total  events observed 
at final analysis, respectively. The stopping boundari es at the interim and final analyses will be 
based on the actual number of OS events at the time of the analysis using Lan-DeMets alpha
-
spending function with O’Brien -Fleming boundari es, taking into account any alpha that was 
passed fro m the rPFS analysis (if applicable) . If the interim analyses are performed exactly at 326
and 552events, respectively, and the rPFS was not si gnificant, the study  coul d be stopped for OS 
superi ority if the p -values are 0.0014and 0.01 8, respect ively . The no minal significance level for 
the final look of OS in all rando mized participants after 690events would then be 0.034.
An independent statist ician external to BMS will perform interim analysis.
Per Protocol Amendment 04 and the decision to terminate the study early, the second interim 
analysis for OS and final analysis for OS will no longer be performed, and the first interim 
analysis will be considered as final. Atthe time of study closeout, an updated descriptive OS 
analysis will be provided to report all death events .

If inform ed consent is initially given by a partici pant’s legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardi an, and the participant subsequent ly beco mes capable of making and communicat ing his or 
her infor med consent during the study, consent must additionally be obtained from the participant.
Revise the informed consent whenever important new informat ion beco mes available that is 
relevant to the participant's consent. The invest igator, or a person designat ed by the invest igator, 
shoul d fully inform  the participant or the participant's legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardi an, of all pertinent aspects of the study  and of any new information relevant to the 
participant's willingness to conti nue participat ion in the study . This communication shoul d be 
docum ented. 
The confidenti ality of records that could identify  subjects/parti cipants must be protected, 
respecting the privacy and confident iality rules applicable to regulatory  requirements, the 
subje cts’/parti cipants’ signed ICF and, in the US, the subjects’/participants’ signed HIPAA 
Authori zation.
The consent form must also include a statem ent that BMS and regul atory  authori ties have direct 
access to participant records. 
The rights, safet y, and well-being of the study subjects/participants are the most important 
considerations and should prevail over interests of science and societ y.

CASE REPORT FORMS
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed 
to record all observat ions and other data pertinent to the invest igation on each individual treated 
or entered as a control in the invest igation. Data that are derived from source documents and 
reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be 
explained. Addit ional clinical informat ion may be collected and analyzed in an effort to enhance 
understanding o f product safet y. CRFs may  be requested for AEs and/or laboratory  abnorm alities 
that are reported or ident ified during the course of the study .
For sites using the Sponsor or designee electronic data capture tool, electroni c CRFs will be 
prepared for all data collect ion fields except for fields specific to SAEs and pregnancy, which will 
be reported on the electroni c SAE form and Pregnancy Surveillance form,respect ively. If 
electroni c SAE form is not available, a paper SAE form can be used. Spaces may be left blank 
only in those circumstances permitted by study -specific CRF completion guidelines provi ded by 
Sponsor or designee. 
The confidenti ality of record s that could identify  subjects/parti cipants must be protected, 
respecting the privacy and confidentialit y rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory 
requi rement(s).
The invest igator will maintain a signature sheet to document signatures and init ials of all persons 
authori zed to m ake entri es and/or corrections on CRFs. 
The co mpleted CRF, SAE/pregnancy CRFs, must be pro mptly reviewed, signed, and dated by the 
investigator or qualified physician who is a subinvesti gator and who is delegated thi s task on the 
Delegati on of  Authori ty Form. Subinvest igators in Japan may not be delegated the CRF approval 
task. For electroni c CRFs, review and approval/signature is completed electroni cally through the 
BMS electroni c data capture tool. The invest igator must retain a copy  of the CRFs including 
records of the changes and corrections.
Each individual electronically signing electroni c CRFs must meet Sponsor or designee training 
requi rements and must only access the BMS electronic data capture tool using the unique user 
account provided by Sponsor or designee. User accounts are not to be shared or reassigned to other 
individuals
MONITORING
Sponsor or designee representatives will review data centrally to ident ify potenti al issues to 
determine a schedule of on -site visits for targeted review o f study  records. 
Representatives of BMS must be allowed to visit all study  site locati ons peri odically to assess the 
data qualit y and study  integrity. They will review study  records and direct ly compare them with 
source documents , discuss the conduct of the study  with the invest igator, and verify that the

In addi tion, the study  may be evaluated by  Sponsor or desi gnee internal auditors and government 
inspectors who must be allowed access to CRFs, source documents, other study  files, and study 
facilit ies. BMS audit reports will be kept confidential.
The investigator must notify BMS prom ptly of any inspect ions scheduled by regula tory authori ties, 
and prompt ly forward copi es of  inspect ion reports to Sponsor or designee. 
RECORDS RETENTION
The invest igator (or head of the study  site in Japan) must retain all study records and source 
docum ents for the maximum period requi red by appli cable regulat ions and guidelines, or 
institution procedures, or for the period specified by BMS or designee, whichever is longer. The 
investigator (or head of the study site in Japan) must contact BMS prior to destroying any records 
associ ated wi th the stu dy.
BMS or desi gnee will notify the invest igator (or head of the study  site in Japan) when the study 
records are no longer needed.
If the investigator withdraws from the study  (eg, relocation, retirement), the records shall be 
transferred to a m utually  agreed upon desi gnee (eg, another investi gator, study  site, IRB). Noti ce 
of such transfer will be given in writ ing to BMS or designee.

APPENDIX 3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT S: 
DEFINITIONS AND PROC EDURES FO R RECORDING, 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW -UP,AND REPO RTING
ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse Event Definition:
An Adverse Event (AE) i s defined as any  new untoward m edical  occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condit ion in a c linical invest igation partici pant administered study  treatm ent
and that does not n ecessarily have a causal relat ionship wit h this treatm ent. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnorm al laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use o f study treatment, whether or 
not cons idered related to the study treatment.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
Any abnorm al laboratory  test results (hematol ogy, clinical chemistry , or urinalysis) or 
resul ts from other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radio logical scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant 
in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. Note that abnormal lab tests or 
other safet y assessments shoul d only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not
available. Once the final diagnosis is known, the reported term  should be updated to be the 
diagnosis .
Exacerbat ion of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condit ion including eit her an increase 
in frequency and/or intensit y of the condit ion.
New condit ions detected or diagnosed after study intervent ion administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  intervent ion 
or a conco mitant medicat ion. Overdose, as a verbatim term (as reported by the invest igator), 
shoul d not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intent ional overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardl ess of sequelae and 
shoul d specify "intent ional overdose" as the verbatim term
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy , appendectomy): the condi tion that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admissio n to a hospital).
DEFINITION OF SAE
If an event i s not an AE per definit ion above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious condi tions 
are met.

SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at ri sk of  death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)
Requi res inpat ient hospitalization or causes prolongation of exist ing hospi talizat ion (see NOTE 
below)
NOTE:
The fo llowing hospi talizati ons are not consi dered SAEs in BMS clinical studies: 
a visit to the emergency room  or other hospi tal departm ent < 24 hours, that does not resul t 
in admissio n (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)
elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
admissio ns as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
routi ne healt h assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (eg, 
routi ne col onoscopy )
medical/surgical admissio n other than to remedy ill healt h and planned prior to entry into 
the study . Appropri ate docum entati on is requi red in these cases
admissio n encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on healt h status 
and requi res no medical/surgical interventi on (eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason)
admissio n for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs (applies 
to oncology  protocol s)
Results in persistent or significant di sabili ty/incapaci ty
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect
Is an important m edical event (defined as a medical event(s) that m ay not be immediately life-
threatening or resul t in death or hospi talizat ion but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardi ze the participant or may require intervent ion [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other seri ous outcomes listed in the definit ion above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatm ent in an emergency  room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not resul t in 
hospi talizati on.) Potenti al drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 9.3.
7for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.) 
Pregnancy and potenti al drug induced liver injury (DILI) must follow the same transmissio n timing 
and processe s to BMS as used for SAEs (see S ection 9. 3.5 for reporting pregnancies).

Any co mponent of a study  endpoint that is considered related to study therapy should be reported 
as SAE (eg, death is an endpo int, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be 
reported).
EVALUATING AES AND S AES
Assessment of Causality
The invest igator i s obligated to assess the relationship between study  intervent ion and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.
A “reasonable possibilit y” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
argum ents to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relat ionship cannot be rul ed out.
The invest igator will use clinical judgment to determine the relat ionship.
Alternat ive causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy , and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relat ionship of the event to study intervent ion administr ation 
will be considered and invest igated.
The invest igator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Inform ation, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE, the invest igator mustdocument in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causalit y.
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the invest igator has minima l 
inform ation to include in the init ial report to Sponsor. However, it is very  important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causalit y for every event before the initial 
transmissio n of the SAE data to Sponsor.
The invest igator may change his/her opinio n of causalit y in light of follow-up informat ion 
and send a SAE fo llow-up report with the updated causalit y assessment.
The causalit y assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regul atory  reporting 
requi rements.
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
If only limited informat ion is initially available, follow-up reports are requi red. (Note: Foll ow-
up SAE reports must include the same invest igator term(s) init ially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensit y or relationship to study  treatm entor if new 
inform ation beco mes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours 
to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitt ing the init ial SAE report.
All SAEs must be fo llowed to resol ution or stabilization.

GUIDELINES (WITH MODIFIED RESP ONSE EVALUATION 
CRITERIA IN SOLID TU MORS (RECIST) CRITER IA FOR SOFT 
TISSUE LESION ASSESS MENT)
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 04.
1 EVALUATION OF LESION S
Bone lesions shoul d be evaluated with Technecium -99m based radionuclide bone scan as per 
PCWG31.
At baseline, soft tissue lesio ns/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable or non -measurable 
as fo llows. 
1.1 Measurable
Tumor lesio ns: Must be accurately meas ured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
10mm by CT/MRI scan (scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm), or 2x slice thickness if 
greater than 5 mm.
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered patho logically  enlarged and measurable, a lymph node 
must be 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT /MRI scan (scan slice thickness reco mmended 
to be no greater than 5 mm).
Lymph nodes merit special ment ion since they are norm al anatomi cal structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathol ogical  nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be ident ified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a  short axis of
15mm by CT /MRI scan. Only  the short axi s of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. 
The short axis of the node is the diameter norm ally used by radiologists to judge if a node is 
involved by  solid tum or. Nodal  size is norm ally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which 
the image isobtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisit ion may be axial, sagi ttal or coronal ). The smaller of these measures is the short axi s. For 
example, an abdo minal node which is reported as being 20 mm x 30 mm has a short axis o f 20mm 
and qualifies as a malignant, m easurable node. In this example, 20 mm  should be recorded as the 
node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis 10 mm but < 15 mm) 
shoul d be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered 
non-patho logical and should not be recorded or fo llowed.
Note: Lesi ons on X -Ray are not to be selected as Target or Non -Target Lesions.
1.2 Non-Measurable
All other soft tissue lesions are considered non-measurable , including small  lesions (longest 
diameter < 10mm or pathol ogical lymph nodes with 10 to < 15 mm short axi s) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions. Lesio ns considered truly non-measurable include: leptomeningeal

reproducible imaging techniques.
Note: Lesi ons on X -Ray are not to be selected as Target or Non -Target Lesions.
1.3 Special c onsiderations regarding bone lesions
Bone lesio ns will be assessed (as non-target lesions) with Technecium -99m based radionuclide 
bone scans as per PCWG3.
1.4 Baseline Documentation Of ‘Target’ And ‘Non- Target’ Lesions
When more than one measurable lesio n is present at baseline all lesio ns up to a maximum of 
20lesio ns total (and a maximum of 
5lesions per organ system )representative of all involved 
organs should be ident ified as target lesio ns and will be recorded and measured at baseline .
Note: A maximum of 5lesio ns can be selected per organ system . For example, a maximum of 
5lung lesions can be selected . A maximum of 5lymph nodes can be selected at baseline, as the 
lymphat ic system is considered one organ.
Target l esions shoul d be selected on the basis of their size (l esions wi th the longest di ameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in additi on shoul d be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated m easurem ents. It m ay be the case that, on occasi on, the largest lesio n does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal  lesions, short axis for nodal  lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calcul ated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axi s is added into the sum . The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as ref erence to f urther characteri ze any objective tum or regression in 
the measurable dimensio n of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including patho logical lymph nodes shoul d be identified as 
non-target lesio ns and shoul d also be recorded at baseline. Pelvic lymph nodes and extrapelvic 
lymph nodes (retroperi toneal, mediastinal, thoracic and other) may be reported separately, per 
PCWG3. Measurements are not required and these lesions shoul d be followed as ‘present’, 
‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ (more details to follow). In addition, it is 
possible to record mult iple non -target lesio ns invo lving the same organ as a single item on the case 
record form (eg, ‘m ultiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘mult iple liver metastases’).
2 RESPONSE CRITERIA
2.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance o f all target lesio ns. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) m ust have reduct ion in short axi s to < 10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions,
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.

Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of  diameters of target l esions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study  (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study ). In addit ion to the rel ative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an abso lute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesio ns is also 
considered progression).
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify  for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study .
Not Evaluable (NE): If one or more target lesions cannot be measured or adequately assessed 
as either fully resolved or too sm all to measure (due to missing or poor quali ty images), and 
the sum of diameters of the remaining measured target lesions (if any) has not increased 
sufficient ly to meet Progressive Disease as defined above. 
2.1.1 Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions
2.1.1.1 Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes ident ified as target lesions shoul d always have the actual short axis measurement 
recorded (m easured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examinati on), even if the nodes 
regress to below 10 mm o n study. This means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, 
the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if compl ete response criteria are met, since a norm al 
lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm. Case report forms or other data collectio n 
methods may therefore be designed to have target nodal lesio ns recorded in a separate sectio n 
where, in order to qualify  for CR, each node m ust achieve a short axis < 10 mm . For PR, SD ,and 
PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesio ns.
2.1.1.2 Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’
While on study , all lesions (nodal  and non-nodal ) recorded at baseline shoul d have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg,2 mm). 
However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline 
beco me so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact 
measure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’. When this occurs it is important
that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it is the opinion o f the radio logist that the lesio n 
has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm . If the lesi on is believed to 
be present and is faint ly seen but too small to meas ure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned
as the ref erence diameter. (Note: It is less likely that thi s rule will be used for lymph nodes since 
they usually  have a definable size when normal and are frequent ly surrounded by fat such as in the 
retrope ritoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too 
small to m easure, a def ault value of  5 mm shoul d be assigned in this circumstance as well). This 
defaul t value is derived fro m the 5 mm CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying 
CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potenti ally non-reproducible, therefore 
provi ding this default value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon measurement 
error. To rei terate, however, if t he radiologist i s able to provi de an actual  measure, that shoul d be 
recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.

2.1.1.3 Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
When non-nodal  lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions shoul d be 
added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between 
them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the 
vector of the longest diameter in this instance shoul d be the maximal longest diameter for the 
‘coal esced lesio n’.
2.2 Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions
This section provides the defini tions of the criteria used to de termine the tumor response for the 
group of non -target lesio ns. While some non -target lesio ns may actually be measurable, they need 
not be measured and instead shoul d be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in 
the protocol.
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance o f all non-target l esions. All lymph nodes must be 
non-patho logical in size (< 10mm short axis). 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target l esion(s)
Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progressio n (see below) of existing non-target 
lesions.
2.2.1 Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non -Target Disease
The concept of progression of non -target di sease requi res addi tional explanati on as fo llows:
2.2.1.1 When the patient also has measurable disease
In this setting, to achieve ‘unequivocal progressi on’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there 
must be an overall level o f substant ial worsening in non -target di sease such that, even in presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficient ly to merit 
discontinuat ion of therapy (see examples in Appendix 2 and further details below). A modest 
‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesio ns is usually not sufficient to qualify for 
unequivocal progressi on status . Pleural effusio ns, pericardial effusi ons and ascites will not be 
followed as target or non-target lesions and will not contribute to response or progression. The 
designation of overall progressi on solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face 
of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.
2.2.1.2 When the patient has only non -measurable disease
This circumstance arises in so me trials when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable 
disease. The same general  concepts apply here as noted above, however, in this instance there is 
no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretati on of an increase in non -measurable 
disease burden. Because worsening in non -target disease cannot be easily quant ified (by defini tion: 
if all lesio ns are truly non -measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for 
unequivocal progressi on is to consider if the increase in overall  disease burden based on the change 
in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be requi red to 
declare PD for measurable disease: ie, an increase in tumor burden represent ing an addit ional 73%

increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable lesion). 
Examples includ e, an increase in lymphangit ic disease from localized to widespread, or may be 
described as ‘sufficient to requi re a change in therapy’. If ‘unequivocal  progressi on’ is seen, the 
patient shoul d be considered to have had overall PD at that point. While it w ould be i deal to have 
objective criteria to apply to non-measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it 
impossible to do so; therefore the increase must be substant ial.
2.2.2 New Lesions
New bone lesio ns
New bone lesions shoul d be evaluated as per PCWG3 criteria.Bone lesions will be assessed by 
radionuclide bone scan only. Radiographic progressio n on bone scan is defined by the following 
criteria:
At least 2 new lesions on the first post -treatm ent bone scan, with at least two addit ional lesio ns
on the next scan (performed at least 6 weeks later) as compared to the first post -treatment bone 
scan. Date of progression is then the date of first post- treatm ent scan .
For scans after the first post-treatm ent scan, at least 2 new lesions relative to the first post-
treatm ent scan AND confirmed on a subsequent scan (perform ed at l east 6 weeks l ater). Date 
of progressi on is the date of the scan that fi rst docum ents at least 2 new lesi ons relat ive to the 
first post -treatm ent scan .
New soft tissue lesio ns
The appearance of new malignant soft tissue lesio ns denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detecti on of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for the 
ident ificat ion of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion shoul d be 
unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modalit y 
or findings thought to represent something other than tumor. This is particularly  important when 
the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosis of a  liver 
lesion may  be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cyst ic lesio n, which it is not.
NOTE: Fluid collect ions (pleural  effusio ns, pericardial  effusions, and ascites) will not be 
considered new l esions and will not contribute to response or progression. In the event a new fluid 
collect ion is seen on a post -baseline imaging exam, a comment m ay be made, but the appearance 
of a new fluid collect ion alone shoul d not resul t in an assessment of Progress ive Disease (PD). A 
lesion ident ified on a follow-up study  in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesio n and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is the pat ient 
who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain ordered which 
reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if 
he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. A lesion ident ified on Chest X-Ray that was not 
present in p rior CT can be considered a new lesio n and will result in Progressive Disease (PD).
If a new lesio n is equivocal, for example because of it s small size, continued fo llow-up evaluat ion 
will clarify  if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is definitely  a  new 
lesion, then progressi on shoul d be declared using the date of the init ial scan.

2.3 Response Assessment
2.3.1 Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from  the start of the study  treatm entuntil 
disease progressi on per PCWG3 criteria, or the last response recorded, taking into account any 
requi rement for confirmat ionand censoring rules regarding subsequent therapy . The patient’s best 
overall response assignment will depend on the findings of both target and non -target disease and 
will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions. Furtherm ore, depending on the 
nature of the study  and the protocol  requi rements, it m ay also requi re confi rmatory  measurement.
2.3.2 Time Point Response
At each protocol -specified time point, a response assessment occurs. Table 2.3.2 -1provides a 
summary of the overall response status calculation at each time point for patients who have 
measurable disease at baseline. When patients have non -measurable (therefore non -target) disease 
only, Table 2.3.2 -2is to be used.

aNon-CR/no n-PD is preferred over SD for non-target disease since SD is increasingly used as endpoint for 
assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised.
2.3.3 Best Overall Response 
Best response determination of complete or partial response requi res confirmation: Complete or 
partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent time point of 
4 weeks (28 days) later. In thi s circumstance, the best overall  response can be interpreted as in 
Table 2.3.3 -1. When SD is believed to be best response, it must meet the protocol -specified 
minimum t ime from the date of first treatment or rando mizat ion date.
For example, if the first scheduled follow-up imaging visit is Week 6 (7 days) for a particular 
protocol , a Best Response of SD can only be made after the subject is on -study  for a minimum  of 
6 weeks (42 days) minus 7 days, for an absolute minimum time on-study  of 35 days from the 
reference start date (reference date is considered Day 1 on study). If the subject is not on -study  for 
at least this amount of time, any tumor assessment indicat ing stable disease before this time period 
will have a Best Response of NE unless PD is identified.
Special note on response assessment: When nodal disease is included in the sum o f target lesio ns 
and the nodes decrease to ‘norm al’ size (< 10 mm), they  may still have a measurement reported 
on scans. T his measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to 
overstate progression shoul d it be based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this 
means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report form (CRF).

CR = complete response, PR = partial response, SD = stable disease, PD = progressive disease, and NE = inevaluable
aIf a CR is truly  met at first time point, then any  disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best 
response would depend on w hether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed 
when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likel y still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR  at the 
first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.
2.3.4 Confirmation Scans
Verification of Response: To be assi gned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor m easurements 
must be confi rmed by consecut ive or subsequent repeat assessments that should be performed no 
less than 28days after the criteria for response are first met. Subsequent documentation of a CR 
may provi de confirmat ion of aprevi ously ident ified CR even with an intervening NEor PR 
(eg,CR NE CR or CR PR CR ).Subsequent documentation of a PR may provide confirmat ion of 
apreviously ident ified PR even with an intervening NE 
or SD (eg, PR NE PR or PR SD PR). 
However, only one (1) intervening time point will be allowed between PR /CRs for confirmat ion.
Verification of Progression :Progressi on of disease should be verified in cases where progression 
is equivocal. If repeat scans confirm PD, then progressio n should be declared using the date of the 
initial scan. If repeat scans do not confirm PD, then the subject is considered to nothave 
progressive disease.

APPENDIX 10 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY OF CHANGE HISTORY
Overall Rationale for the Protocol Amendment 03, 13-Sep-2022
Protocol  Amendment 03 includes changes to expand the radiographic progressi on-free survival 
(rPFS) analysis populat ion and 
clarify censoring rules for rPFS  
,and clarificat ion of pharmacokinet ic (PK) sampling at follow-up visits, and 
clarificati on of severe acute respi ratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2)serology at 
follow-up as opti onal. 
Main changes have been included in the statist ical analysis sect ion,in which the population for the 
number ofrPFS analysis has been changed from the first 544 randomized participants to all 
rando mized  for expansio n to Intent ion-to-treat (ITT) . By incorporating the 
delayed treatm ent effect , the number ofrPFS events has been increased from 433 to 530, the 
number of andthe number of overall survival (OS) events has been increased from 615 to 690 for 
final analysis .Addit ional revisio ns in the stati stical analysis section have been added to align and 
clarify the populati ons f oranalysis.  
Addit ional revisi ons, including to secti ons of  the Synopsis, have been made to ali gn the protocol 
with respect to these changes. This protocol amendment applies to all participants.

changed the number of target rPFS events 
from 433 to 530. OS events increased from 
615 to 690. Updated enrollment rate. rPFS an alysis was
expanded to the entire Intention -to-

rationale for this change that is based 
on the curent observed event rate, it 
is not feasible to observe 433 events 
in the first 544 randomized 
participants . Based on previous 
observed delayed effect of nivolumab

Overall Rationale for the Revised Protocol 01, 06-May -2020
Revised Protocol 01 includes changes  
 
to clarify the inclusion criteria for current evidence of metastatic 
disease and prior treatment with NAT, and to clarify lesions that do not qualify as visceral disea se.
Frequency of tumor assessment was revised to enhance precisio n of the radiographic 
progression -free survival (rPFS) endpo intand thecriteria for stable disease (SD)was revised based 
on frequency of tumor assessments. The statist ical secti on now speci fies sample size for rPFS.
In addition Revised Protocol  01 includes revisi ons made  
. These include provi ding guidance ontreatm ent of infusi on reactions for nivolumab 
and docetaxel , clarifying the purpose of 30-minute observat ion period between nivolumab and 
docetaxel, mandating discontinuation of docetaxel for cystoid macular oedema (CMO) and for 
Grade3 hypersensit ivity react ion
,and modifying the rules for dose reducti on of docetaxel to 
align with docetaxe l labeling .In addition to changes made for clarityand alignment with 
nivolumab program- wide standards , changes were also made to explicit ly state the time period for 
collect ion for all non-serious adverse events and to exclude participants with HIV, as described 
below.

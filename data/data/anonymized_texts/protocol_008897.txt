Study design 
 
This study is a single- center  phase II multi- arm study. This  study will include patients (age ≥18 
years)  with recurrent/metastatic sarcoma,  who have received  at least one prior  systemic  therapy 
(if a standard  therapy exists for the subtype), divided into the following  categories/subtypes:  
 
a. Adipocytic tumors (Well -differentiated/dedifferentiated  liposarcoma, 
myxoid liposarcoma, pleomorphic liposarcoma)  
b. Vascular  tumors  (leiomyosarcoma,  angiosarcoma)  
c. Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma  
d. Synovial sarcoma  
e. Osteosarcoma  
f. Other  sarcomas.

Duration of treatment 
The expected duration of a patient’s participation in the trial is up to 15 months, including 
screening,  treatment  period (maximum of 12 months),  and a follow-up visit at 1 month after last 
treatment and every 3 months after end of treatment (± 28 days) thereafter until progression or death. Patients who progress after completing 12 months of therapy in the observation period 
can be re-treated.  
 
Investigational product dosage and mode of administration 
Regimen 1 Dose:  
Durvalumab 1500 mg and tremelimumab 75 mg every 4 weeks for 4 cycles followed by 
Durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks for up to 8 additional cycles. 
Mode of administration: Both agents will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion. 
Tremelimumab will be administered first, and the infusion duration will be approximately 1 
hour. The durvalumab  (MEDI4736) infusion will start approximately  1 hour after the end of the 
tremelimumab infusion, and the infusion will be administered over approximately 1 hour. The combination of both agents shall be administered at Q4 week intervals for a maximum of 4 
doses, after which the durvalumab will continue as a single agent at Q4 week intervals till 
progression or unacceptable toxicity  for a maximum of 8 additional doses.  If toxicity  was noted 
with the combination, investigator can decide to continue durvalumab alone in case patient is 
having clinical benefit (SD or better).  
Subjects enrolled who achieve and maintain disease control through the end of the treatment 
period will enter follow -up. During the first 12 months of follow-up, if the subject has 
progressive disease (PD),  the subject may be re-administered  durvalumab/tremelimumab  for up 
to another 12 months with the same treatment guidelines followed during the initial 12-month 
period provided the subject does not meet any of the investigational product discontinuation 
criteria and fulfills the criteria for retreatment in  the setting of PD, which include absence of 
clinical symptoms or signs indicating clinically significant disease progression; no decline in 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status compared to baseline; and 
absence of rapid  disease progression or threat to vital organs/critical anatomical sites (eg, spinal 
cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention. 
 
This study will not only allow us to evaluate the efficacy and safety of durvalumab and 
tremelimumab but provide the translational science to guide further development of novel immunotherapeutic agents in sarcomas.

Statistical methods  
 
Sample Size: The planned sample size includes a maximum of 25 subjects in each cohort and 
less than or equal to 150 evaluable subjects in total for the combination of durvalumab and 
tremelimumab.  
 
Design: The primary efficacy endpoint will be progression -free survival (PFS) at 12 weeks 
(PFS 12 weeks ). 12-week PFS is defined as evidence of stable disease or better 12 weeks after the 
initiation of therapy. In the meanwhile, we will also monitor the toxicity of the agent (Thall, 
1996). Toxicity will be assessed within the first two cycles of the treatment (56 days). If there is a high probability that the PFS
12 weeks is unlikely to be at least 40% or that the unacceptable 
toxicity rate is likely to be greater than 30%, the drug would not be considered of interest for 
further study. Formally if Pr(PFR 12 weeks < 0.40 | Data) > 0.90 or Pr(toxicity rate > 0.30 | Data)  
> 0.90, the corresponding cohort will be stopped. The assumed prior distribution for PFS 12 weeks 
is Beta (0.4, 0.6) and for toxicity is Beta (0.3, 0.7). The resulting prior means are 0.40 and 0.3  
for PFS 12 weeks and toxicity rate, respectively, with one patient worth of information. Each of  the 
disease cohorts will be monitored separately in cohorts of 5 patients after a minimum of 5 
patients have been enrolled. For cohort 1, 2 and 6, since these include more than distinct 
subtypes, in order to assess anti -tumor activity of the treatment regimen within each histologic 
subtype, we will open enrollment simultaneously for each of the histologic subtypes but keep the maximum number of patients at 25 in each of these cohorts. Patients who are not evaluable 
for re sponse to the treatment by 12 weeks post initiation of treatment will be considered a 
treatment failure.  
 
Analysis plan:  
 
Efficacy: If a cohort is stopped early,  this drug will not be considered  of interest for future study 
for this cohort of patients. If all 25 patients are accrued, we will estimate the PFS 12 weeks and the 
corresponding 95% posterior credible interval. We will also apply a Bayesian hierarchical 
statistical model (Wathen, 2008) to analyze the data from all six cohorts to borrow information 
from each other. Response rate will be estimated along with 95% confidence interval. PFS and overall survival (OS) will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method (Kaplan,1958). Log- 
rank test (Mantel, 1966) will be performe d to test the difference in survival between groups. 
Regression analyses of survival data based on the Cox proportional hazards model (Cox, 1972) 
will be conducted on PFS or OS.

Safety: Toxicity data will be summarized by frequency tables. For the toxicity endpoint, per - 
treated  analysis will be  used to include  any patient who  received  the treatment regardless of the 
eligibility nor the duration or dose of the treatment received. Toxicity rate will be estimated with 
95% credible interval.  
 
Correlatives: Exploratory data analysis and graphical methods will be applied to examine the 
distribution of the biomarker data, error checking, and outlier identification. T -test/ANOVA or 
their nonparametric countparts, Wilcoxon rank-sum test/Kruskal -Wallis test will be used to 
detect  differences of the biomarkers  between  groups (1) Linear  mixed  effect  models for repeated 
measures analysis (Liang, 1986) will be employed to assess the change of the biomarkers over time with multi -covariates including disease characteristics (tumor stage, site, pathology), and 
other prognostic factors. Appropriate transformation of the outcome assessment values will be 
used to satisfy the normality assumption of linear mixed effect model.

INTRODUCTION  
Background and rationale for conducting this study  
Sarcomas  are a rare collection  of mesenchymal tumors  with around 11,000 new cases diagnosed 
each year in the United States (2). While low -grade, localized disease may be amenable to 
surgical resection, patients with unresectable disease or metastasis have a high mortality rate. 
Currently, cytotoxic chemotherapy is the primary treatment modality for patients with 
unresectable/metastatic disease,  and the most common  front- line regimens include doxorubicin. 
While time to progression on doxorubicin -containing combinations has repeatedly been shown 
to be superior to that of doxorubicin alone, overall survival is not different in the same randomized studies (3). Furthermore, previous studies have shown an estimated median survival 
for these patients to be approxim ately 8 to 13 months from the start of first -line anthracycline -
based chemotherapy, (4 -7). Gemcitabine -docetaxel is most commonly used in the second line 
with specific activity against leiomyosarcomas and undifferentiated pleomorphic  sarcoma.  
Recently,  pazopanib, a multi -tyrosine  kinase receptor  inhibitor,  received an FDA indication for 
use in soft tissue sarcomas on the basis of a 4.6 -month progression -free survival (PFS), a 3 -
month improvement compared to placebo. Despite some of these advances there are still sub -
types such as epithelioid sarcoma, clear cell sarcoma or well -differentiated liposarcomas for 
which we have no effective regimens beyond surgical resection.  
 
In several solid tumor types, there are data to suggest that an antigen -specific adaptive immune 
response to cancer naturally exists in patients. In the tumor microenvironment, antigen 
presenting cells acquire and process peptides released from cell turnover during tumor growth. 
The most potent antigen presenting cells are dendritic cells (DCs). DCs then migrate to the 
draining lymph nodes where they s ensitize and activate T cells against these peptide antigens. 
T cells, in particular antigen -specific, cyto toxic CD8 T cells, are then capable of eliminating 
antigen- expressing tumor cells found in the peripheral tissues. This process is restricted by the 
display of the antigen on  the tumor cell surface  in the context of an appropriate,  matched  major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC; e.g. human leukocyte antigen or HLA) molecule.  
 
Multiple inhibitory mechanisms, however, may be responsible for the inability of the immune 
system to eliminate tumor cells. Inappropriate antigen presentation or lack of appropriate 
activation signals from DCs can result in the opposite effect, tolerance of T cells to the target 
antigen. Immunosuppressive cytokines (TGF -beta, IL -10) and alternate immune cell types 
(myeloid derived suppressor cells, regulatory T cells, tumor- associated macrophages) present 
at the tumor microenvironment may directly inhibit the anti -tumor immune response. Tumor

cells may lose expression of the target antigen and thus avoid detection. Activated T cells also 
express inhibitory signals known as immune checkpoint molecules, which arise naturally and 
dampen the immune response, to the advantage of tumor cells. Among the most extensively 
studied immune checkpoint molecules are CTLA4 and PD-1. 
 
Immune -based  therapies,  offer the possibility of significant response and even  durable complete 
responses for patients with cancers that are considered “incurable” (8, 9), but remain largely unexplored in sarcoma. Anti -CTLA -4 activity via ipilumumab has demonstrated survival 
benefits in melanoma  and agents that target programmed death -1 (PD-1) have shown responses 
and potential survival benefits in various malignancies such as melanoma, non- small cell lung 
carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma (9, 10). The presence of TILs and more importantly PD - 
L1 expression  in the tumor  have been  correlated  with objective response to the anti-PD-1 agent, 
nivolumab (9, 11). 
 
High expression of PD -1/PD -L1 has also been reported in various subtypes of sarcoma and has 
been  shown to be a negative prognostic marker  for OS (12-14). Recent  data also shows blockade 
of PD-1/PD -L1 interactions dramatically  improves  the function of osteosarcoma- reactive CTLs 
in vitro and in vivo , and results in decreased tumor burden and increased survival in the K7M2 
mouse model of metastatic osteosarcoma (15). Combination immunotherapy with α -CTLA -4 
and α-PD-L1 antibody blockade in the K7M2  mouse model of metastatic  osteosarcoma resulted 
in complete control of tumors in a majority of mice as well as immunity to further tumor 
inoculation (16). Our preliminary clinical data also confirms the presence of PD -L1 expression 
in multiple sarcoma subtypes tested at MD Anderson (alveolar so ft part sarcomas, 
chondrosarcomas, leiomyosarcomas, liposarcomas, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas, 
osteosarcom as, and synovial sarcomas to name a few) (Figure 1). A majority of sarcomas also 
have a defined immunologic target (e.g. chromosomal fusion protein, cancer testis antigen, or 
mutation) and there is indeed a naturally -occuring immune infiltrate in multiple sarcomas. 
Previous studies,  including  one from  our group has demonstrated the presence  of TILs  in certain 
sarcoma subtypes (17 -19). The presence of a naturally -occurring immune infiltrate in many 
subtypes of sarcomas is encouraging and suggests that immunotherapy may potentially be beneficial in these patients. Interestingly, one of the earliest examples of immunotherapy from 
the late 19
th century (Coley’s toxin) was in fact, motivated by a sarcoma patient with tumor 
regression after clearance of a bacterial  infection.  
 
We believe checkpoint inhibitors will lead to clinical benefit in at least some of these sarcoma subtypes and lead to a survival benefit. This study will help us evaluate the clinical benefit in

multiple common sarcoma subtypes (selected on the basis of their higher mutation load, 
presence of TILs, and/or PD -L1 staining). This study will help us identify the immune markers 
of response or resistance in these sarcomas that will inform the future development of immunotherapy options for these patients. As part of this investigator -initiated study we  intend 
to analyze blood and tissue  specimens to help us select  the next novel immunotherapeutic  agent 
from the Medimmune pipeline that is likely to benefit these  patients.

Durvalumab and Tremelimumab Background  
Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab are briefly described below. Refer to the current 
Investigator’s Brochures for details.  
 
Durvalumab Background 
Durvalumab is a human immunoglobulin G (IgG)1 kappa mAb directed against human PD-L1. 
Durvalumab is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and has an overall molecular weight of 
approximately 149 kDa. Durvalumab selectively binds human PD -L1 with high affinity and 
blocks its ability to bind to PD -1 and cluster of differentiation (CD)80. The fragment 
crystallizable (Fc) domain of Durvalumab contains a triple mutation in the constant domain of 
the IgG1  heavy chain  that reduces binding  to the complement component C1q and the Fc gamma 
receptors responsible for mediating antibody- dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity  (20). 
 
Tremelimumab Background  
Tremelimumab (formerly CP -675,206) is a human IgG2 mAb being investigated as a cancer 
immunotherapeutic agent.  Tremelimumab  is expressed  in NS0 (murine  myeloma) cells and has 
an overall molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa. Tremelimumab is specific for human 
CTLA -4, with no cross -reactivity to related human proteins. Tremelimumab blocks the 
inhibitory effect of CTLA -4, and therefore enhances T- cell activation. Tremelimumab shows

minimal specific binding to Fc receptors, does not induce natural killer (NK) ADCC activity, 
and does not deliver inhibitory signals following plate- bound aggregation.  
 
Summary of Nonclinical Experience 
Nonclinical experience with durvalumab and tremelimumab  are briefly  described  below. Refer 
to the current Investigator’s Brochures for details.  
 
Durvalumab Nonclinical Experience  
Programmed cell death 1 (CD279) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of molecules involved in regulation of T -cell activation. It is found on T cells, B cells, 
macrophages, NK cells, dendritic cells, and mast cells. It has also been described on peripheral 
tissues including cardiac endothelium, lung, small intestine, keratinocytes, isle t cells of the 
pancreas, and syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta as well as a variety of tumor cell types (21- 32). 
 
Programmed cell death ligand 1 (CD274, B7- H1) is constitutively expressed on many 
hematopoietic cells, but may be upregulated in hematopoietic and non- hematopoietic cells. 
Regulation of PD -L1 is mediated, in part, by type I and type II interferon (IFN). Programmed 
cell death ligand 2 (PD -L2; B7 -DC) was identified in 2001 (25, 33). Its expression is far more 
restricted and is confine d to hematopoietic cells.  
 
Engagement of PD -1 on T cells inhibits activation with downstream effects on cytokine 
production, proliferation, cell survival, and transcription factors associated with effector T -cell 
function (34- 39); ).  
 
Durvalumab has shown the following activity as an anti -PD-L1 molecule:  
• Durvalumab binds to PD -L1 and blocks its interaction with PD -1 and CD80.  
• Durvalumab can relieve PD -L1-mediated suppression of human T- cell activation in  vitro. 
• Durvalumab inhibits tumor growth in a xenograft model via a T -cell-dependent 
mechanism.  
• A surrogate anti -mouse PD-L1 antibody resulted in improved survival in a syngeneic tumor 
model as monotherapy and resulted in complete tumor regression in > 50% of treated mice when 
given in combination with chemotherapy. 
• In the same study, anti -mouse PD -L1 antibody- treated mice were completely tumor free  3 
months after tumor implantation and demonstrated long- term immunity  during

re-challenge.  
• In a subsequent study  in the same syngeneic model, the combination of an anti-mouse PD- 
L1 antibody and anti -CTLA -4 antibody resulted in complete tumor regression in all mice 
treated.  
• Prevalence of PD -L1 expression on the surface of human tumors, ranging from 
approximately 0% to 35%, was demonstrated in a broad survey of samples derived from  tumor 
types of interest.  
 
The cynomolgus monkey is considered to be the only relevant  nonclinical species for evaluation 
of local and systemic toxicities of durvalumab. In addition, in vivo in cynomolgus monkeys, 
durvalumab suppresses soluble programmed cell death ligand 1 (sPD -L1) in serum and fully 
occupies membrane PD -L1 on various leukocyte subsets at doses equal to or more than 0.1 
mg/kg (lowest dose tested) with a dose-related duration of suppression and occupancy. 
 
In general, there  were  no durvalumab- related  adverse effects  in toxicology studies conducted in 
cynomolgus monkeys with durvalumab that were of relevance to humans. Adverse findings in 
the non- Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic and dose 
range- finding study (4 doses over 5 weeks), and a GLP 4-week repeat -dose toxicity study were 
consistent with antidrug antibody (ADA) -associated morbidity and mortality in individual 
animals. The spectrum of findings, especially the clinical signs and microscopic pathology, in a single animal in the GLP, 4-week, repeat -dose study was also consistent with ADA immune 
complex deposition, and ADA:durvalumab immune complexes were identified in a  subsequent 
non-GLP, investigative immunohistochemistry (IHC) study. Similar observations have been 
reported by MedImmune in cynomolgus monkeys administered human mAbs unrelated to 
durvalumab. Given  that immunogenicity of human mAbs  in nonclinical  species is not generally 
predictive  of responses  in humans, the ADA- associated  morbidity  and mortality  were  not taken 
into consideration for the determination of the no -observed- adverse -effect level (NOAEL) of 
durvalumab. Interim audited data from the dosing phase of the pivotal 3 -month GLP toxicity 
study with durvalumab in cynomolgus monkeys showed that subchronic dosing of durvalumab 
was not associated with any adverse effects. Therefore, the NOAEL of durvalumab in all the 
general  toxicity  studies was considered to be 100 mg/kg,  the highest dose tested  in these  studies. 
In addition to the in vivo toxicology data, no unexpected membrane binding of durvalumab to 
human or cynomolgus monkey tissues was observed in GLP tissue cross -reactivity  studies  using 
normal human and cynomolgus monkey tissues. Finally, in vitro cytokine release studies

showed that durvalumab and tremelimumab, either alone or in combination, did not induce 
cytokine release in blood from any donor. 
 
Tremelimumab Nonclinical Experience  
Cytotoxic T -lymphocyte- associated antigen 4 (CD152) is a cell -surface receptor expressed 
primarily on activated T cells. Cytotoxic T -lymphocyte- associated antigen 4 engagement on 
activated  T cells inhibits  cytokine synthesis and restricts  cell proliferation  (40-44) . Upon  T-cell 
activation, CTLA -4 expression is upregulated and acts to dampen immune responses, 
modulating and eventually switching off T -cell activation. The natural ligands for CTLA -4 are 
CD80 and CD86, which are present on antigen- presenting cells (APCs). Binding of these 
ligands to CTLA -4 delivers a negative regulatory signal to T  cells.  
 
Tremelimumab  selectively  binds to human CTLA -4 and blocks binding of CD80  and CD86  and 
has been shown to enhance human T- cell cytokine release in response to  stimulation.  
 
Both in vitro and in vivo preclinical data suggest that a range of anti -CTLA -4 mAb exposures 
has the potential to be efficacious, the lower end of the potentially efficacious range being a 
plasma concentration of approximately 10 μg/mL and the target plasma concentration being 30 
μg/mL. The toxicology program conducted for tremelimumab consisted of in vivo general 
toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys for up to 6 months duration, an embryo- fetal 
development study in monkeys, tissue cross -reactivity studies in both monkey and human 
tissues, and blood compatibility studies. Overall, tremelimumab toxicities were consistent with inhibition of CTLA -4 and with clinical safety findings, and indicated that chronic clinical use of 
tremelimumab may lead to adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract, skin, lymphoid organs, 
thyroid tissues, and hematologic systems. Clinical dose -limiting toxicity (DLT; eg, 
gastrointestinal effects) and non-DLT (eg, skin rash) were appropriately identified in a chronic 
toxicity study in monkeys. Most toxicities were reversible or showed a trend towards 
reversibility.  
 
An embryo- fetal development study was conducted in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during 
the period of organogenesis. Tremelimumab  administered  intravenously (IV) once weekly  from 
Days 20 to 50 of gestation at doses of 0, 5, 15, or 30 mg/kg did not elicit maternal toxicity, 
developmental toxicity, or teratogenicity.

Durvalumab Clinical Experience  
MEDI4736 has been administered to subjects in 5 ongoing clinical studies (2 investigating 
MEDI4736 as monotherapy and 3 as combination therapy). 
 
Monotherapy Studies 
Study CD -ON-MEDI4736-1108: 
Study CD -ON-MEDI4736- 1108 is a Phase 1, first -time-in-human, multicenter, open- label, 
dose- escalation,  and dose-expansion study to determine  the maximum tolerated  dose (MTD)  or 
optimal biologic dose, safety, PK, immunogenicity, and antitumor activity of durvalumab in 
adult subjects with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapy or for which no 
standard therapy exists. A total of 414 subjects with advanced solid tumors have been treated in 
Study CD -ON-MEDI4736- 1108, where 393 of these subjects have received durvalumab at 10 
mg/kg Q2W  (either in the dose- escalation  or dose-expansion phase of the study). In  addition, 21 
subjects have been enrolled in the following dose -escalation cohorts: 4 subjects in each  of the  
0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg Q2W cohorts, 3 subjects in the 3.0 mg/kg Q2W  cohort, and 6 subjects in 
the 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W)  cohort. 
Of the 393 subjects treated with 10 mg/kg Q2W, 331 subjects (84.2%) had at least 1 AE (regardless of causality; Table 5.3.1.3- 1). Overall, the most frequently reported (≥ 10% of 
subjects) AEs (all grades) were fatigue, nausea, dyspnea, decreased appetite, constipation, 
diarrhea, vomiting, cough, pyrexia, back pain, and rash. Approximately half (48.1%) of these 
AEs were  Grade 1 to 2 in severity  and manageable by general  treatment guidelines as described 
in the current durvalumab study protocols. Grade 3 or higher AEs were noted in 141 of 393 
subjects (35.9%). These events occurring in more than 1% of subjects were dyspnea (5.1%); 
increased gamma -glutamyltransferase (3.3%); fatigue, general physical health deterioration, 
increased aspartate aminotransferase, and back pain (2.3% each); anemia and dehydration (1.8% each); and abdominal pain, vomiting, sepsis, syncope, sepsis, and hypotension (1.3% each). 
 
Treatment -related AEs were reported for 162 of 393 subjects (41.2%). The most frequently 
reported (≥ 2% of subjects) treatment -related AEs (all grades) were fatigue (13.5%); nausea 
(8.4%); diarrhea, decreased appetite, and rash (5.3% each); vomiting (4.8%) ; pruritus (4.1%);

dyspnea (3.8%); pyrexia (3.1%); hypothyroidism (2.8%); increased alanine aminotransferase, 
increased aspartate aminotransferase, and cough (2.5% each); myalgia (2.3%); and abdominal 
pain and dizziness (2.0% each). Treatment -related Grade 3 events that occu rred in 2 or more 
subjects were fatigue (4 subjects), increased gamma -glutamyltransferase (3 subjects), and 
vomiting, increased alanine aminotransferase, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and 
arthralgia (2 subjects each). There were 2 subjects with treatment- related Grade 4 events 
(hypercalcemia, fatigue) and 1 subject with a treatment- related Grade 5 event (progression of 
disease [verbatim term]). However, the causality of the Grade 5 AE was changed to “not related” 
after the data cutoff date of 14Jul2014. According to the patient safety database, 1 subject  in 
this study died due to treatment- related  angiopathy (entry  into the clinical  database is pending).  
 
A total of 229 SAEs  (regardless  of causality)  have been  reported in 123 of 393 subjects (31.3%) 
treated with 10 mg/kg MEDI4736 Q2W. The SAEs reported for 5 or more subjects were dyspnea, general physical health  deterioration, pyrexia, abdominal pain, back  pain, dehydration, 
pleural effusion, and sepsis.  Eleven  subjects (2.8%)  had SAEs  considered related  to durvalumab 
by the investigator.  A majority  of these  events were  Grade  3 or higher in severity  and recovered 
with or without sequelae.  
 
Three subjects with treatment- related SAEs died. Two deaths due to progression of disease; 
pneumonitis was ongoing at the time of one of the subject’s death but pleural effusion had resolved. The third death was due to treatment -related angiopathy. 
 
Of the 414 subjects treated with durvalumab (all dose levels), 169 subjects were evaluable for 
response analysis, which included subjects who had at least 24 weeks of follow -up as of 
14Jul2014 and had either at least 1 post -baseline tumor assessment or experienced clinical PD 
or death. Nineteen subjects (11.2%) had a best overall response of CR/PR (confirmed and 
unconfirmed). The DCR (CR + PR + SD ≥ 12 weeks) was 32% (54 of 169 subjects). 
Programmed cell death ligand 1 status (based on Ventana/MedImmune assay) was known for 
143 of 169 evaluable subjects, of whom 30 were PD -L1 positive. A best overall response of 
CR/PR (confirmed  and unconfirmed) was observed in 7 of 30 (23.3%) PD-L1-positive subjects 
and in 6 of 113 (5.3%) PD- L1-negative subjects.

Overall,  12 of 18 Japanese subjects (66.7%) who have been  treated  in Study  D4190C00002 had 
at least 1 AE (Table 5.3.1.3- 2). Treatment -related AEs were reported for 9 of 18 subjects 
(50.0%). The most frequent (≥ 2 subjects)  treatment -related  AEs (all grades) were  constipation, 
stomatitis, fatigue, pyrexia, and pruritus (2 subjects each). In the majority of the subjects, the 
maximum severity of AEs was Grade 1 (6 of 12 subjects) or Grade 2 (5 of 12 subjects). These 
events were manageable by general treatment guidelines as described in the study protocol. 
Grade  3 or higher AEs were  reported  in 1 subject in the 10 mg/kg MEDI4736 Q2W  cohort. The 
event for this subject was a Grade 3 treatment -related SAE of decreased free tri -iodothyronine. 
The SAE was ongoing at the tim e of the subject’s death due to disease progression. 
 
Limited  efficacy  data are available for  Study D4190C00002. Twelve  of 18 subjects had at  least 
1 post- baseline tumor assessment.  One subject  had a best overall response of PR (unconfirmed) 
and 6 subjects had SD as assessed by RECIST guidelines v1.1 (45). 
 
Study D4191C00003 (ATLANTIC; Phase 2 Open Label in Subjects with NSCLC) 
Fourteen subjects have been  treated  in Study D4191C00003. Subjects have  received  1 to 4 doses 
of durvalumab (10 mg/kg Q2W). Only SAE data (from the patient safety database) are 
available. One of 6 subjects reported SAEs. The events were Grade 3  abnormal 
 
liver function test, thrombotic stroke (severity unknown), Grade 3 asthenia, and Grade 3 
ischemic cerebral infarction. The subject died due to asthenia and ischemic cerebral infarction. 
None of the SAEs were considered related to investigational product.  
 
Study D4190C00007 (Phase 1 Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion in Subjects with Myelodysplastic Syndrome [MDS])  
Two subjects have been  treated  in Study D4190C00007. Subjects have  received  2 to 3 doses of 
durvalumab (10 mg/kg Q2W) and both subjects reported AEs. All of these events were Grade 
1 or 2 in severity,  with 3 events considered to be related  to durvalumab. Nearly  half of the events 
resolved. No DLTs have been  reported.  
 
Study D4191C00001 (PACIFIC; Phase 3 Randomized in Subjects with NSCLC)  
One subject has been treated in Study D4191C00001. The subject received 6 doses of 
investigational product. The subject had events of Grade 1 dehydration and sinus tachycardia, Grade 3 shortness of breath, and Grade 3 hypotension (downgraded to Grade 2). The event of 
dehydration was considered  related  to investigational product. All of the events resolved,  except 
for sinus tachycardia that was reported as ongoing.

Durvalumab and Tremelimumab Combination Study Experience  
 
Study D4190C00006 
Study D4190C00006 is  a multicenter,  open- label,  dose- escalation,  and dose -expansion study of 
durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, 
immunogenicity, and antitumor activity  of durvalumab and tremelimumab  in adult subjects with 
advanced NSCLC. In the dose -escalation phase up 102 patients were enrolled and received 
treatment. (46) Median follow up was 18.8 weeks (IQR 11 – 33). The maximum tolerated dose 
was exceeded in the cohort receiving durvalumab 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks plus tremelimumab 
3 mg/kg.  
 
Overall, 82 of the 102 subjects (80%) reported a treatment -related AE (all grades,). See table 1 
for details. The most common of these AEs included diarrhea in 33 patients (32%), fatigue in 24 patients  (24%), and pruritus  in 21 patients  (21%).  There  was no dose dependency of the AEs 
noted in subjects with fixed dose of tremelimumab 1 mg/kg. Most of the Grade 1 and 2 AEs were manageable. Fifty -six subjects (55%) required treatment with immunosuppressants 
(corticosteroids, adalimumab, or infliximab) from all cohorts (102 patients). There were 15 
(35%) of 43 patients  that received one  or more  doses  of the study  regimen  after the initiation  of 
the first grade 3 or grade 4 treatment- related adverse event.  
 
Forty -three of 102 subjects (42%) experienced grade 3/grade 4 treatment- related AEs. Thirty - 
seven of 102 subjects (36%) experienced a treatment -related SAE. See Table 2 for details. 
Twenty -nine of the 102 subjects (28%) discontinued the study as a result of treatment.  
 
For the cohort of durvalumab 10 – 20 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 4 weeks plus tremelimumab 1 
mg/kg, the most common treatment -related hematologic grade 3/grade 4 toxicity was anemia in 
3 subjects (5%). The most common treatment -related, non- hematologic grade 3/grade 4 toxicity 
was diarrhea in 4 subjects (7%). The most treatment -related, grade 3/4 laboratory abnormality 
was increased lipase in 5 subjects (9%).  
 
There were 3 deaths (3%) related to treatment. One patient died from complications arising from myasthenia gravis (durvalumab 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks plus tremelimumab 1 mg/kg). Another 
patient died of complications related to a pericardial effusion (durvalumab 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks plus tremelimumab 1 mg/kg). The last treatment -related death occurred due to  a 
neuromuscular disorder (durvalumab 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks plus tremelimumab 3 mg/kg).

Study D4880C00010 
 
Study D4880C00010 is a Phase 1, multicenter, open- label, dose- escalation and combination 
phase study of tremelimumab to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and 
antitumor activity of tremelimumab monotherapy and tremelimumab in combination with 
durvalumab in adult Japanese subjects with advanced solid malignancies. As of the data cutoff 
date of 12Nov2014, a total of 11 subjects has been  treated  in the study with 8 subjects receiving 
tremelimumab monotherapy (4 subjects each at 3 and 10 mg/ kg) and 3 subjects receiving 10 
mg/kg tremelimumab in combination with 15 mg/kg Q4W durvalumab. 
Eight (72.7%) of the 11 subjects had treatment- related AEs. The most frequently reported 
treatment- related  AEs were:  fatigue (4 subjects),  diarrhea,  decreased  appetite, pruritus,  maculo - 
papular rash (3 subjects each), and hypothyroidism (2 subjects).  
 
Serious adverse events were reported in 4 of 11 subjects (36.4%), of whom 3 subjects (27.3%) 
had events that were considered related to treatment. One female subject with advanced 
thymoma received  tremelimumab  10 mg/kg and durvalumab 15 mg/kg. She developed Grade  3 
hypophysitis and Grade 4 muscular weakness after one dose. The  subject developed worsening 
generalized muscle weakness requiring mechanical ventilation. The muscular weakness was 
eventually diagnosed as myasthenia gravis and considered related to treatment. The  underlying 
diagnosis of thymoma likely increased the risk of developing myasthenia gravis. No treatment - 
related deaths have been reported in this  study. 
 
Study D4190C00010 
 
Study D4190C00010 is a Phase 1, multicenter, open- label, dose -exploration, and dose - 
expansion study to evaluate the safety,  tolerability,  antitumor  activity,  PK, and immunogenicity 
of durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab in subjects with select advanced solid 
tumors.  The study has enrolled  3 subjects in the dose exploration phase.  Two subjects have been 
treated as of the data cutoff date of 12Nov2014.

other preferred  terms  were  reported  in 1 subject each.  A majority  of the events were  considered 
mild or moderate in severity and not related to  tremelimumab.  
 
Two of 6 subjects reported an SAE: systemic inflammatory response syndrome and worsening 
pleural effusion. The event of systemic inflammatory response syndrome was severe and 
considered related to initial treatment with tremelimumab. The subject died due to this event 
and only received tremelimumab therapy prior to developing the SAE. The event of worsening 
pleural effusion was considered to be moderate in severity and not related to tremelimumab.  
 
D4191C00004 
 
D4191C00004 is a Phase 3 open -label multi- center, global study in subjects with locally 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC (Stage IIIB -IV). The study will evaluate durvalumab used as 
monotherapy (10 mg/kg), tremelimumab  (10 mg/kg)  used as monotherapy and durvalumab used 
in combination with tremelimumab. This study was originally planned as a monotherapy study 
with durvalumab. The protocol was amended in August 2014 to include a tremelimumab 
combination arm as well as a tremelimumab monotherapy  arm. No subjects have been enrolled 
in any portion of the study as of the data cutoff date of 12Nov2014. 
 
Tremelimumab Clinical Experience  
As of the data cutoff date of 12Nov2014 (for all studies except D4190C00006 that has a cutoff 
date of 04Dec2014), 22 sponsored clinical studies have been conducted as part of the 
tremelimumab clinical development program. Of these studies, 13 have been completed and 9 are ongoing. Tremelimumab has been administered as monotherapy to 973 subjects (not 
including 497 subjects who have been treated in the blinded Phase 2b study, D4880C00003 
[DETERMINE])  participating  in 10 of the 22 sponsored clinical studies,  2 of which  are ongoing. 
Most of these subjects had melanoma and received the tremelimumab 15 mg/kg every 90 days 
dosing regimen. In addition, 208 subjects with a variety of tumor types have received 
tremelimumab in combination with other anticancer agents in 12 of the 22 sponsored clinical studies, 7 of which are ongoing. 
 
Across the clinical development program for tremelimumab a pattern of efficacy has emerged, 
also observed for the related  anti- CTLA -4 antibody, ipilimumab,  which  appears to be consistent 
across tumor types for this class of agents. Response rates to anti -CTLA -4 antibodies are 
generally low, approximately 10%. However, in subjects who respond, the responses are generally durable, lasting months to years even in subjects with aggressive tumors, such as, 
refractory  metastatic melanoma.  Some  subjects may have had  progression of their disease early 
during treatment,  with delayed  tumor  response or disease stabilization.  Tremelimumab  has been

tested in a Phase 3 study for advanced melanoma. Although the study failed to demonstrate 
improved overall survival (OS; primary endpoint) following a prespecified interim futility 
analysis, the final analysis showed a median OS of 12.6 months in the tremelimumab arm and 
10.7 months in the dacarbazine/temozolomide arm. The ongoing Phase 2b study in recurrent 
pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma is testing an alternative dosing schedule of tremelimumab with a dose of 10 mg/kg Q4W to maximize exposure to tremelimumab while 
managing safety  according  to the established  anti-CTLA -4 AE management  guidelines. The 10 
mg/kg Q4W  regimen  is also being tested  in an ongoing Phase 2 investigator-sponsored study in 
malignant mesothelioma  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
 
In clinical  subjects,  tremelimumab  exhibits  linear  (dose- proportional) PK following IV infusion. 
The estimate  of clearance,  volume of distribution at steady  state,  and terminal -phase half-life is 
1.132 mL/h/kg, 81.2 mL/kg, and 22.1 days, respectively. These values are consistent with those 
of natural IgG2.  
 
Overall, 944 of the 973 subjects (97.0%) treated with tremelimumab monotherapy experienced at least 1 AE. The events resulted in discontinuation of tremelimumab in 10.0% of subjects, 
were  serious in 36.5%, were  considered  to be treatment  related  in 79.1% of subjects.  The profile 
of AEs and the spectrum of event severity have remained stable across the tremelimumab clinical  program  and are consistent  with the pharmacology of the target.  To date,  no tumor type 
or stage appears to be associated  with  unique AEs (except  for vitiligo  that seems  to be confined 
to subjects with melanoma). Events reported in the tremelimumab monotherapy studies at a 
frequency > 5% and assessed by the investigator as treatment related were diarrhea (41.2%), 
rash (27.2%), pruritus (25.1%), fatigue (23.8%), nausea (21.9%), vomiting (13.5%),  decreased  
appetite(11.3%), headache (7.2%), pyrexia (7.0%), abdominal pain (6.7%), and colitis (5.5%). 
The events of diarrhea,  rash,  and pruritus  are considered  as identified  risks.  Infusion- related  side 
effects are rare. The incidence and/or severity of many of the AEs observed following administration of tremelimumab can be reduced by adherence to current immune -related 
toxicity management guidelines. 
 
As of the data cutoff date of 12Nov2014, 659 subjects (67.7%) who received tremelimumab monotherapy have died. Majority of the deaths were ascribed to the subject’s underlying 
malignant disease (61.8%), only 5 deaths were  caused  by AEs considered  by the investigator as 
related to tremelimumab (0.5%), whereas the remaining causes included other or unknown/missing (7.1%). 
 
The frequency of any AEs and ≥ Grade 3 AEs was generally similar across the tremelimumab dose groups. However, a higher percentage of subjects in the 10 mg/kg Q28D and 15 mg/kg

Q90D groups compared with the < 10 mg/kg group experienced treatment -related AEs, SAEs, 
AEs resulting in discontinuation of investigational product, and deaths. 
 
Rationale for study design and dosing  
Rationale for study design 
Sarcoma is a heterogeneous group of diseases that includes more than 50 subtypes. 
Traditionally, due to the rarity of sarcomas they have been lumped together in clinical trials 
even though response to treatment is quite variable among the different subtypes. This has slowed the progress in identifying novel effective therapies that might be relevant for specific sarcoma subtypes. Optio ns for treatment for patients with advanced / recurrent or metastatic 
disease are quite limited. This study is designed to e valuate the efficacy of check -point inhibitors 
in the multiple sarcoma subtypes divided into cohorts that will be individually analysed. The 
first five cohorts were selected on the basis of their higher frequency, the mutational load and 
reported presence of PD -L1 positivity in prior studies. The 6
th cohort will allow enrollment of 
subjects with other sarcoma subtypes not included in the first 5. The goal  of this trial is not only 
to test the efficacy and safety of the check -point inhibitor combination farthest along in 
development (anti -PDL -1 and anti -CTLA4) but have the correlative studies to help guide us 
regarding the biomarkers for activity or lack thereof and inform us in prioritizing the novel 
immunotherapeutic agents for the next trial.  
 
Rationale for endpoints  
Response to systemic therapy in metastatic/refractory disease is low and is less meaningful if 
not correlated with improvement in survival. For this reason, PFS has become an acceptable 
metric in the measurement of efficacy in sarcomas with refractory disease or in sarcomas with 
primary resistance to anthracycline -based chemotherapies. The objective data to support use  of 
PFS as a primary end point in sarcomas was derived from a review of the EORTC sarcoma 
database by van Glabbeke et al in 2002 (46). In  the EORTC analysis,  which  involved 12 clinical 
trials, patients with no prior treatment received experimental agents were compared to those with prior systemic treatment who were received experimental agents. In a multivariate analysis, 
patients with prior therapy obtained an improved PFS with active agents compared to inactive 
agents. For previously treated patients, an active agent was associated with a PFS of at least 
39% and 14% at 3 months and 6 months, respectively. Inactive agents were  associated with a  
PFS of 21% and 8% at 3 months and 6 months, respectively.  
 
Hence PFS has been used as the primary end -point to determine if the investigational agents 
being tested are active in the sarcoma subtypes. Secondary endpoints include safety, response 
rate by RECIST and irRC and OS.

Rationale for pre- treatment and on treatment biopsy  
In addition to evaluating the efficacy of these novel immunotherapeutic agents in sarcoma, the 
unique strength  of this study is the translational science  that can  not only help us understand the 
rationale  for response and resistance but also guide us with the selection  of appropriate sarcoma 
subtypes and also the right combination of immunotherapeutic agents for the next planned 
studies. All patients will require to have baseline tissue available from a resection or biopsy 
(archived  samples are acceptable if they are recent  within  6 month with no intervening treatment 
including radiation  to the biopsied lesion). Exceptions to  the baseline biopsy  will be made only 
on a case- to-case basis after discussion with the PI. For example, if a biopsy attempt was 
unsuccessful or if the risk was felt to be unduly high. On- treatment biopsy at 6 weeks will be 
optional but we hope to acquire at least 10 patient biopsies in each cohort. Patients who got  
baseline fresh biopsy will be encouraged to get an on- treatment biopsy so we can ge t paired 
samples in at least 10 patients in each cohort. The pre-treatment biopsy and on- treatment  biopsy 
for 10 patients  in each cohort is key in order to maximize  the potential of this collaboration with 
Medimmune and strategically access their novel immunotherapeutics pipeline to benefit 
sarcoma patients.  We will need  to understand the immune -microenvironment of the tumors and 
the patient characteristics that lead to response or resistance. The biomarkers from tissue and blood acquired as part of this prospective trial will be analyzed in real -time by the correlative 
science team headed by Dr. Wistuba and Dr. Lazar, so the results can inform the next phase of 
the sarcoma immunotherapy studies. Blood for correlative testing including flow cytometry (under Dr. Bernatchez) will be obtained at baseline, 2 weeks, 6 weeks and at the time of 
confirmed  progression. Patients  who are part of this trial but do not experience benefit from the 
combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab  might be eligible  for future combinations  based 
on their tumor immunoprofile.  
 
Rationale for dosing of durvalumab and Tremelimumab 
A population PK  model was developed for durvalumab using monotherapy data from  the Phase 
1 study, CD-ON-MEDI4736- 1108 (N = 292; doses of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W  or 15 mg/kg Q3W; 
solid tumors). Population PK analysis indicated only minor impact of body weight on PK of 
durvalumab (coefficient of ≤ 0.5). The impact  of body weight- based  (10 mg/kg Q2W)  and fixed 
dosing (750 mg Q2W) of durvalumab was evaluated by comparing predicted steady- state PK 
concentrations (5th, median and 95th percentiles) using the population PK model. A fixed dose 
of 750 mg was selected to approximate 10 mg/kg (based on median body weig ht of ~75 kg). A 
total of 1000 subjects were  simulated  using body weight distribution of 40 to 120 kg. Simulation 
results demonstrate that body weight -based and fixed dosing regimens yield similar median 
steady -state PK concentrations with slightly less overall between -subject variability with fixed 
dosing regimen.

Similarly, a population PK model was developed for tremelimumab using data from Phase 1 
through Phase 3 (N = 654; doses of 0.01 to 15 mg/kg Q4W or every 90 days; metastatic 
melanoma; (47). The population PK model indicated minor impact of body weight on PK of 
tremelimumab (coefficient of ≤ 0.5). The weight -based (1 mg/kg Q4W) and fixed dosing (75 
mg/kg Q4W;  based  on median  body weight of ~75 kg) regimens were  compared  using predicted 
PK concentrations (5th, median  and 95th percentiles)  using population PK model in a simulated 
population of 1,000 subjects with body weight distribution of 40 to 120 kg. Similar to 
durvalumab, simulations indicated that both body weight -based and fixed dosing regimens of 
tremelimumab yield similar median steady state PK concentrations with slightly less between - 
subject variability with fixed dosing regimen. 
 
Similar findings have been reported by others (48- 51). Wang and colleagues investigated 12 
mAbs and found that fixed and body size -based dosing perform similarly, with fixed dosing 
being better for 7 of 12 antibodies (49). In addition, they investigated 18 therapeutic proteins 
and peptides and showed that fixed dosing performed better for 12 of 18 in terms of reducing 
the between -subject variability in PK/pharmacodynamics parameters (50). A fixed dosing 
approach is preferred by the prescribing community due  to ease of use and reduced dosing 
errors. Given expectation of similar PK exposure and variability, we considered it feasible to 
switch  to fixed  dosing regimens.  Based  on an average body  weight of 75 kg, a fixed  dose of 750 
mg Q2W  durvalumab is equivalent to 10 mg/kg Q2W,  1500 mg Q4W  durvalumab  is equivalent 
to 20 mg/kg Q4W, and 75 mg Q4W tremelimumab is equivalent to 1 mg/kg Q4W.

STUDY DESIGN  
Description of the Study  
This is a single center, open- label, phase II study to evaluate the antitumor activity, safety, 
tolerability and immunogenicity of durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab in subjects 
with advanced/metastatic sarcomas. This study will include patients (age ≥12 years) with 
recur rent/metastatic sarcoma, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy (if a 
standard therapy exists for the subtype), divided into the following categories/subtypes: 
 
1. Adipocytic tumors (Well -differentiated/dedifferentiated  liposarcoma, 
myxoid liposarcoma, pleomorphic liposarcoma)

2. Vascular tumors (leiomyosarcoma,  angiosarcoma)  
3. Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma  
4. Synovial sarcoma  
5. Osteosarcoma  
6. Other  sarcomas  
 
A Bayesian design will be used to analyze data in each of the cohorts. 
 
Treatment Regimen  
Durvalumab 1500 mg IV and tremelimumab 75 mg IV every 4 weeks for 4 cycles followed by 
durvalumab 1500 mg every  4 weeks  for up to 8 additional cycles.  If toxicity  was noted with the 
combination, investigator can decide to continue durvalumab alone in case patient is having 
clinical benefit (SD or better).  
 
Cycle duration: 28 days  
 
Mode of Administration : Tremelimumab will be administered first and the infusion duration 
will be approximately 1 hour. The durvalumab  infusion  will start approximately  1 hour after the 
end of the tremelimumab infusion and the infusion will be administered over approximately 1 
hour. Both agents will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion Q4W for 4 doses, after 
which durvalumab will continue to be administered Q4W (up to 8 additional  doses).  
 
Subjects enrolled who achieve and maintain disease control through the end of the 12-month treatment period  will enter  follow- up. During the first 12 months of follow -up, if the subject  has 
progressive disease (PD), the subject may be re- administered durvalumab/tremelimumab (4 
doses of combination followed by single agent durvalumab) and continue treatment as long as 
they do not meet any of the investigational product discontinuation crit eria (Section 4.6). In  the 
setting of PD, they need to meet criteria for continuation in the setting of PD; which include 
absence of clinical symptoms or signs indicating clinically significant disease progression; no 
decline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status compared to 
baseline; absence of rap id disease progression or threat to vital organs/critical anatomical sites 
(eg, spinal cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention; and  continuing 
benefit in the opinion of the investigator and PI. 
 
 
Management of study related toxicities 
Based  on the mechanism  of action  of durvalumab and tremelimumab  leading  to T-cell activation 
and proliferation, the occurrence of irAEs that are either overlapping or greater than each of these  drugs when  used as monotherapy is possible. Potential irAEs  may be similar  to those seen 
with the use of ipilimumab,  nivolumab, or the combination  thereof  and may include immune-

endocrinopathies (8- 10, 52). Subjects should be monitored for signs and symptoms of irAEs. In 
the absence of an alternate etiology (eg, infection or PD), an immune -related etiology should be 
considered for signs or symptoms of enterocolitis, pneumonitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, neuropathy, 
and endocrinopathy. In addition to the treatment modifications shown in Table 3.1.5 -1, it is 
recommended that management of  irAEs follow the guidelines outlined for ipilimumab (53). 
These guidelines recommend the following:  
1. Subjects should be evaluated to identify any alternative  etiology. 
2. In the absence of a clear  alternative  etiology, all events of an inflammatorynature  should 
be considered to be immune -related.  
3. Symptomatic and topical therapy should be considered for low-grade events. 
4. Systemic corticosteroids should be considered for a persistent low-grade event or for a 
severe event. 
5. More potent immunosuppressives should be considered for events not responding to 
systemic steroids (eg, infliximab, mycophenolate, etc). 
 
Treatment modifications will not be required for AEs that are clearly not attributed to 
durvalumab or tremelimumab (such as an accident) or for laboratory abnormalities that are not deemed to be clinically significant. Dose reductions of durvalumab or tremelimumab are not 
permitted.  
 
Treatment modifications may be required for durvalumab and tremelimumab in the event of 
treatment- related toxicity. General guidelines regarding treatment modification are provided in 
Table 3. All toxicities will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.03. If toxicity requires discontinuation of check- point inhibitor therapy and was experienced while receiving the 
combination, the investigator has the option to continue single agent durvalumab if safe and if clinical benefit is noted (SD or better).

Cohort enrollment 
Describe Bayesian design and monitoring of patients  
Within each cohort, we will treat up to 25 patients. The primary efficacy endpoint will be 
progression- free survival at 12 weeks (PFS 12 weeks). 12-week  PFS is defined as evidence of stable 
disease  or better  12 weeks after the initiation  of therapy. In the meanwhile,  we will also monitor 
the toxicity of the agent. Toxicity will be assessed within the first two cycles of the treatment. 
If there is a high probability that the PFS 12 weeks is unlikely to be at least 40% or that the 
unacceptable toxicity  rate (as described  in section  3.2.2 below) is likely  to be greater  than  30%, 
the drug would not be considered of interest for further study. The cohort will be monitored in 
cohorts of 5 patients after a minimum of 5 patients have been  enrolled. 
 
Unacceptable toxicity  
All toxicities will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria  for Adverse Events (NCI  CTCAE)  v4.03. Toxicities  will be managed  per section  3.1.2. 
In each cohort if the unacceptable toxicity rate as described below is greater than 30%, then 
further enrollment in that cohort will stop. Patients already on therapy will continue on treatment 
as per  protocol.  
 
Toxicity that is clearly and directly related to the primary disease or to another etiology is excluded from this definition.  
Any Grade 4 immune- related adverse event (irAE)  
 
Any Grade 3 or 4 noninfectious pneumonitis irrespective of duration 
Any Grade  2 pneumonitis that does not resolve to ≤ Grade  1 within  3 days of the 
initiation of maximal supportive  care 
Any Grade 3 irAE, excluding colitis or pneumonitis, that does not downgrade to Grade 
2 within 3 days after onset of the event despite optimal medical management including 
systemic corticosteroids or does not downgrade to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline within 14 
days 
Liver  transaminase  elevation  > 8 × upper limit  of normal (ULN)  or total bilirubin  5 × ULN 
Any ≥ Grade 3 non- irAE  
The following will not be considered as unacceptable toxicity: 
• Grade 3 fatigue lasting ≤ 7 days 
• Grade  3 endocrine disorder (thyroid,  pituitary,  and/or adrenal insufficiency) 
that is managed with or without systemic corticosteroid therapy and/or 
hormone replacement therapy and the subject is asymptomatic 
• Grade  3 inflammatory  reaction  attributed  to a local  antitumor response (eg,

inflammatory  reaction  at sites of metastatic disease,  lymph nodes, etc) 
• Concurrent vitiligo or alopecia of any AE grade 
• Grade  3 infusion -related  reaction  (first  occurrence and in the absence 
of steroid prophylaxis) that resolves within 6 hours with  appropriate 
clinical  management  
• Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia that is not associated with fever or systemic  infection 
that improves by at least 1 grade within 3  days. 
• Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia 
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia that is not associated with clinically significant 
bleeding that requires medical intervention, and improves by at least 1 grade 
within 3 days  
• Isolated Grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities that are not associated with clinical 
signs or symptoms and are reversed with appropriate maximal medical 
intervention within 3 days 
 
Immune -related  AEs are defined  as AEs of an immune  nature  (ie, inflammatory)  in the absence 
of a clear alternative etiology. In the absence of a clinically significant abnormality, repeat 
laboratory  testing  will be conducted to confirm significant laboratory  findings. 
 
SUBJECT SELECTION, ENROLLMENT, RESTRICTIONS, 
DISCONTINUATION AND WITHDRAWAL  
Number of Subjects

lesion is well defined, measurable per irRECIST, and has clearly 
progressed. 
b. Subjects undergoing fresh tumor biopsies must have additional non- 
target lesions that can be biopsied at acceptable risk as judged by the 
investigator or if no other lesion suitable for biopsy, then an irRECIST target lesion used for biopsy must be ≥ 2 cm in longest 
diameter.

biomarker studies. Tumor tissue must be identified and availability confirmed 
prior to initiation of study therapy. In the setting where archival material is 
unavailable or unsuitable for use, or there have been multiple intervening 
therapies subjects must consent and undergo fresh tumor biopsy. A tumor lesion 
planned for biopsy must not be an irRECIST target lesion unless there are no other lesions suitable for biopsy and lesion used  for biopsy is ≥ 2 cm in longest 
diameter.

Subject enrollment 
Study participation begins (ie, a subject is “enrolled”) once written informed consent is obtained. Once informed consent is obtained, and the patient is enrolled an accession number will be assigned, and the screening evaluations may begin to assess study eligibility 
(inclusion/exclusion) criteria. The accession number will be used to identify the subject during 
the screening process and throughout study participation, if applicable. A master log of all 
consented subjects will be maintained at the site and will document all screening failures (ie, 
subjects who are consented but do not meet study eligibility criteria), including the reason(s) for 
screening failure. Subjects who fail to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria (ie, screening 
failures) should not receive investigational product. There can be no exceptions to this rule. 
Subjects who are screening failures should be withdrawn from the study. 
 
Withdrawal from the Study  
Subjects are at any time free to withdraw from the study without prejudice to further treatment 
(withdrawal of consent). Such subjects will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence 
of any AEs. If possible, they will be seen and assessed by an investigator.  Adverse

events will be followed up by the investigator for as long as medically indicated. 
 
Withdrawal from Treatment  
If a subject withdraws consent to further treatment, they will not receive any further 
investigational product(s), but may continue with further study observation. Subjects who 
decline to return to the site for evaluations will be offered follow -up by phone according to the 
schedule in Section 4.2.3 as an alternative. If a subject withdraws from further participation in the study, then no further study visits or data collection should take place. 
 
Withdrawal of Consent 
If consent is withdrawn, the subject will not receive any further investigational product(s) or 
further study observation. Note that the subject may be offered additional tests. 
 
Lost to Follow- up 
Subjects will be considered lost to follow -up only if no contact  has been  established  by the time 
the study is completed such that there is insufficient information to determine the subject’s status 
at that time. Subjects, who refuse continued participation in the study, including phone contact, 
should be documented as “withdrawal of consent” rather than “lost to follow -up.” Investigators  
should document attempts  to re-establish  contact  with missing  subjects throughout the study 
period. If contact with a missing subject is re- established, the subject should not be considered 
lost to follow -up and a ny evaluations should resume according to the protocol. 
 
Discontinuation of investigational product 
An individual subject will not receive any further investigational product (durvalumab and 
tremelimumab) if any of the following occur in the subject in question:  
 
1. Withdrawal of consent from further participation in  study 
2. Lost to follow -up 
3. An AE that, in the opinion  of the investigator or the sponsor, contraindicates further dosing. 
If toxicity was noted with the combination, investigator can decide to continue durvalumab 
alone in case patient is having clinical benefit (SD or better).  
4. Subject experienced unacceptable toxicity as defined in Section  3.2.2 
5. Subject is determined  to have met one or more  of the exclusion criteria  for study participation 
at study entry  and continuing investigational product dosing might constitute a safety  risk 
7. Pregnancy or intent to become pregnant 
8. Subject noncompliance that, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor, warrants 
withdrawal (eg, refusal to adhere to scheduled visits)  
9. Initiation of alternative anticancer therapy including another investigational agent

10. Confirmation of PD and retreatment criteria in the setting of PD are not met (absence of 
clinical symptoms or signs indicating clinically significant disease progression; no decline in 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status compared to baseline; and 
absence of rapid  disease progression or threat to vital organs/critical anatomical  sites (eg, spinal 
cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention.  
 
Replacements of subjects  
Nonevaluable subjects who withdraw  consent prior  to any study  related  treatment  or are unable 
to begin treatment will be  replaced.  
 
Withdrawal of consent for data and biological samples 
Study data are protected by the use of an accession  number, which  is a specific number for each 
subject. The investigators are in control of the information that is needed to connect a study 
sample to a subject. A subjects consent to the use of data does not have a specific expiration 
date,  but the subject  may  withdraw  consent at any time by notifying  the investigator.  If consent 
is withdrawn  any samples collected  prior to that time may still be  used but no additional  data or 
samples will be collected unless specifically required to monitor safety of a subject.  
 
SCHEDULE OF STUDY PROCEDURES  
All patients will have history/physical examinations & laboratory assessments during the screening phase (day - 30 to day -1) and prior to each drug administration every four weeks. 
Laboratory assessments for toxicity will be every 2 weeks for the first four months then the 
frequency will change to every 4 weeks. Patients with grade 3 or 4 immune- related adverse 
events (irAEs) will receive immunosuppressive treatment with systemic corticosteroids as per protocol. 
 
Baseline imaging studies (CT -scans and/or MRI -scans) should be within 30 days prior to 
treatment initiation. The first restaging assessment will be performed at week 8 (+/- 1 week) 
with a confirmatory scan at 12 weeks (+/ - 1 week). Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and Immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid tumors (iRECIST) 
will be used to measure response to treatment.  Thus,  the patient will continue on treatment until 
confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or unless the patient chooses to withdraw consent for study  participation.  
 
Baseline biopsies  will be obtained prior  to treatment initiation  (archived  sample  is acceptable if 
it is within 6 months with no intervening therapy including radiation to the biopsied lesion). In

each cohort we hope to have at least 10 patients that undergo a repeat biopsy at 6 weeks (+/ - 1 
week). Those patients who undergo a fresh biopsy prior to the start of the treatment will be 
encouraged to get the on- treatment biopsy to ensure availability of matched fresh tumor 
specimens for correlative analysis. Those patients with an increased risk from repeat biopsy as determined by the PI and the IR physician will be exempt. These biopsies would be obtained 
through interventional radiologic techniques with exception to superficial tumors that are accessible by punch biopsy. Blood work obtained for correlative studies would be performed at 
baseline, week 2, and week 6 (+/ - 1 week for all time points). Blood draw for correlative 
biomarkers should coincide with the biopsy date when feasible. Optional biopsy and a blood 
draw for correlative  studies will be performed at the time of confirmed progression in patients 
with prior evidence of response.

Follow -up period  
Table 6 shows all procedures to be conducted during the end of treatment visit and follow -up period. For subjects who 12 months of therapy, 
the last dosing visit within the 12 -month period is considered to be the end of treatment visit. Subjects who discontinue before 12 months 
will complete the end of treatment visit at the time the decision is made to discontinue treatment. Patient will complete all 12 cycles of 
treatment if meets all criteria per protocol even if greater than 12 months.  
 
All subjects are to complete the end of treatment visit, all follow -up visits and be contacted for survival status in accordance with the 
Schedule of Assessments. However, if a subject discontinues from treatment and moves onto alternative anticancer treat ment, the follow -up 
visits will no longer be required; however, survival follow- up assessments would be required as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
unless the subject withdraws consent for further survival follow -up. Survival follow- up will contin ue until the end of study as defined in

Efficacy assessments 
Efficacy  
Tumor assessments will be based on irRC (54) and will be performed according to the schedule 
presented in Section 5. Investigators are required to assess the subjects based on irRC and irRECIST. Antitumor activity will a l s o be assessed by RECIST guidelines v1.1 during central 
review of scans. After end -of-treatment subjects will be followed for progression and survival 
every 3 months (± 28 days) thereafter ( according to the schedule in Table 6) through the end 
of the study (defined as 5 years after the final subject is enrolled or when all data points to 
assess the end -points of this study have been collected). 
 
Tumor assessments may include the following evaluations: physical examination (with 
photograph and measurement of skin lesions as applicable); cross -sectional imaging using CT, 
positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and CT or MRI scan of the brai n. Computed tomography or MRI 
scan of the brain will be performed if the subject is neurologically symptomatic. The preferred  
method of disease  assessment  is CT with contrast.  The same  metho d is preferred  for all 
subsequent tumor assessments. If PET/CT imaging is utilized, the metabolic changes 
(alterations in FDG avidity) will be noted, but these changes alone will not guide therapy 
unless the treating investigator deems it to be necessary and it is approved by the principal 
investigators.  
Physical examination  
Lesions detected by physical examination will only be considered measurable if superficial, eg, skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes. Documentation by color photography including 
ruler is recommended for estimating the size of skin lesion.  
 
Computed tomography scan with contrast of the chest, abdomen, 
and pelvis (optional scan of pelvis unless known pelvic disease is present 
at baseline)  
Computed tomography scans should be performed with contiguous cuts in slice thickness of 5 
mm or less. Spiral CT should be performed  using a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction  algorithm.  
 
Magnetic resonance imaging scans 
Magnetic resonance imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis is acceptable for measurement 
of lesions provided that the same anatomical plane is used for serial assessments. Computed 
tomography or MRI scan of the brain will be performed only at screening or if the subject is 
neurologically symptomatic. If possible, the same imaging modality should be used for serial

evaluations. In case of MRI,  measurements will be preferably performed in the axial 
(transverse) plane on contrast -enhanced T1 -weighted images. However, there are no specific 
sequence recommendations.  
 
Positron Emission Tomography – Computed Tomography  
At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET -CT is not 
always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements. However, if the 
CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with 
IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET- CT can be used for RECIST 
measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring 
cancer lesions over time. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional 
data, which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.  
 
While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable to 
incorporate the use of FDG- PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of 
progression (particularly possible 'new' disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG- PET 
imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG- PET at follow -up is a sign of PD  based 
on a new lesion. 
 
b. No FDG- PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed  by CT, this is PD. If the positive FDG- 
PET at follow -up is not confirmed  as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up CT scans 
are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD 
will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan). If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up 
corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the 
anatomic images, this is not  PD. 
 
Note : A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one that is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
 
Measurability of Tumor Lesions  
Tumor lesions will be categorized as follows:  
• Measurable  Lesions - Must  be accurately  measured  in at least one dimension (longest 
diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size  of: 
◦ 10 mm by CT scan (irrespective  of scanner  type) and MRI  (no less than double the

slice thickness and a minimum of 10 mm).  
◦ 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (when  superficial).  
◦ Malignant lymph nodes are considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short  axis when  assessed  by CT scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  
• Nonmeasurable Lesions - Nonmeasurable lesions are defined as all other lesions (or 
sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis).  Lesions considered  truly  nonmeasurable 
include the following: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, 
inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, and abdominal masses/abdominal  organomegaly identified  by physical exam  that is not measurable by 
reproducible imaging  techniques.
 
• Target Lesions - At baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a 
maximum of 2 lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be 
identified as target lesions. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement  in which  circumstance the next largest  lesion 
which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  
• Non-target Lesions - It is possible to record  multiple  non- target  lesions involving the 
same organ as a single item (eg, “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes” or  “multiple 
liver metastases”).  
• New Lesions - If measurable, new lesions will be measured and included as target 
lesions.  Up to 3 additional target  lesions (maximum  of 2 additional lesions per organ) 
may be added in this way. Other new lesions will be included as non-target  lesions.  
 
Evaluation of Tumor Response by irRC 
Tumor response will be assessed by the irRC and irRECIST (54). irRECIST and irRC are  a 
reconciliation of RECIST guidelines v1.1 with the original irRC (55). The latter standard 
incorporated principles important for assessment of IMT for cancer, but fundamentally 
differed from RECIST in using 2 -dimensional tumor assessment. In contrast, irRECIST is 
based on 1 - dimensional tumor measurement, but it differs from RECIST guidelines v1.1 in 
the following key ways:  
 
• Under RECIST guidelines v1.1, the appearance of new lesions indicates PD. Under 
irRECIST, new measurable lesions are incorporated in the tumor burden,  which is used

to determine immune -related progressive disease (irPD), immune -related partial 
response, and immune -related complete response (irCR). New nonmeasurable lesions 
preclude irCR.  
• Under RECIST  guidelines v1.1, there  is no confirmation  for PD. In addition, responses 
and irPDs  must be confirmed  by consecutive scans at least 4 weeks apart,  assuming no 
clinical  deterioration.  
 
The following sub- sections describe irRECIST in more detail.  
 
Tumor Burden 
At baseline, the tumor burden is the sum of single diameters (short axis for nodal lesions, 
longest diameter for other lesions) for the target lesions. In subsequent scans, the diameters of 
new measurable lesions are added to the tumor burden. If a subject is retreated, then up to 5 
target lesions (perhaps different from the original lesions) will be selected and a new baseline 
tumor burden will be  established.  
 
Overall Response at a Single Time Point 
Table 7 shows the disease response will be determined at a single assessment based on 
irRECIST.

Physical examination  
Physical examinations will be performed according to institutional guidelines on study days 
noted in Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3, and weight and height will be assessed (at screening only). 
Findings from medical history (obtained at screening) and physical e xamination shall be 
given a baseline grade according to the procedure for AEs. Increases in severity of pre- 
existing conditions during the study will be considered AEs, with resolution occurring when 
the grade returns to the prestudy grade or below.

Electrocardiograms (12 -lead) will be recorded on study days as noted in Sections 5.1 and 
5.2. Electrocardiograms recorded on Day 1 will be obtained in triplicate (all 3 within a 5- 
minute time period). In case of clinically significant ECG abnormalities, including an ECG 
that demonstrates a QT corrected using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) value > 500 
millisecond, 2 additional 12-lead ECGs should be obtained over a brief period (eg, 30 
minutes) to confirm prolongation. 
 
Vital signs

biospecimens will be collected using the Biorepository NCI Best Practices, and standard 
operating procedures (SOPs). All specimens and derivatives are given de -identified numbers.  
 
Translational studies to be performed on tissue and blood will be detailed in a separate  manual. 
A brief description of each type of specimen collection and processing is included below: 
 
1) Core needle biopsy (CNB) samples : At least 5 cores will be obtained from the CNB 
procedure, and if possible, fine needle aspiration  (FNA)  specimens will be collected.  Whenever 
possible additional passes to obtain fresh  tissue for flow cytometry  will be done. The CNB  cores 
(~6-8 mm in length) will be processed as FFPE and fresh frozen specimens. The FNA samples 
will be placed on 4- 6 smears and fixed in alcohol -based fixative immediately after collection, 
and if possible, a cell -block specimen will be prepared. The CNB and FNA specimens will be 
examined for quality control and pathological characterization before being utilized for 
immune -profiling, as well as for DNA, RNA, protein extractions and flow. These samples will 
be stored at  -80°C. 
 
2) Tissue collection from surgically resected tumors (during or prior to start of therapy) : Fresh 
frozen  and formalin -fixed  and paraffin -embedded  (FFPE)  specimens will be obtained. For fresh 
frozen and FFPE collections, at least two specimens, tumor and adjacent normal tissue will be 
removed from removed from the surgically resection immediately. The fresh specimens if 
obtained will be used for: a) fresh tissue for flow cytometry and other procedures that require 
fresh tissue samples; b) “snap” frozen in liquid nitrogen; c) RNA “later”; d) OCT embedded; 
and, e) fixation in formalin. Samples will be stored at -80°C for subsequent isolation of  nucleic 
acids and protein. For all fresh tissue samples, correspondin g FFPE tissues will be available, 
including tumor and normal  tissue  specimens.  The tissue specimens  will be examined  for quality 
control and pathological characterization before being utilized for immune -profiling, as well  as 
for DNA, RNA and protein extractions.  
 
3) Peripheral blood specimens:  Blood will be collected at baseline, week 2, week 6 and at 
confirmed progression (5 green- top tubes, 8- 10 ml per tube at each time point) per patient. Of 
those, plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be immediately obtained, aliquoted and stored at - 80°C. 
 
Pathological evaluation and quality control (QC). All tissue specimens collected will be 
reviewed by a reference pathologists. At least, three types of QC activities for specimens 
collected  will be performed:  a) histology/cytology examination of the tissues and cells;  b) tissue 
quality assessment  of fresh  specimens for extraction  of DNA,  RNA  and proteins, and to prepare 
histology specimens such as whole sections for immunohistochemistry and

immunofluorescence; and, c) quality assessment of DNA, RNA and protein extracted. All 
histology stained samples will be scanned and digital images will be available. 
 
Nucleic acids and protein extraction. All blood, tumor and corresponding normal tissue 
samples will be subjected to DNA, RNA and protein extraction using standard methods. DNA 
and RNA quantity and integrity will be assessed using NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer 
(Nanodrop technologies) and Pico- green analysis. Also, protein lysate will be extracted using 
standard methods.  
 
Immuno -profiling: Fresh frozen and FFPE tissues will be used for analysis of immune markers. 
For immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) analyses, histology sections obtained from both type of tissue specimens will be will be utilized. IHC and IF will be 
performed on autostainers or manually. All antibodies used will be optimized for IHC/IF by 
examination of positive and negative controls and testing of the antibodies standard methods, 
including Western blotting. All pathology slides will be scanned into a digital image scanner 
and analyzed using image analysis software, including among others the Aperio Image 
Toolbox™ (Leica Biosystems) and Inform ™ (Perkin -Elmer). For quantification of immune 
markers  (immune  cells infiltrates,  immune  checkpoints and other proteins) whole tissue sections 
or five randomly selected one -mm square areas within the tumor region will be selected for 
analysis.  In selected  cases,  peritumoral and intratumoral areas  will be examined. The expression 
of markers  in malignant cells will be evaluated  using image  analysis  to determine  the percentage 
of positive cells (0 to 100) and intensity (0 to 3+), with a total score ranging from 0 to 300 (H - 
score system).  The expression of protein  markers  and inflammatory  cells will be examined using 
an infiltrate  density score established  by the number of cells expressing a determined  marker by 
tissue area. The data and digital images will be deposited in a central database for review of pathology collaborators.  For muliplex  IF analysis,  we will use the specialized  microscopes such 
as the Vectra system (Perkin -Elmer) which includes the Nuance software. Among other 
markers,  we will study  the expression  of the following PD-L1, PD -1, FOXP3, CD3, CD4,  CD8 
CD20,  CD45Ro,  CD57, CD68,  and Granzyme B; additional markers  will be selected  according 
the results of the initial analysis.  
 
As additional exploratory analysis,  we will consider to perform tumor DNA genotyping by next- 
generation sequencing and other methodologies to identify mutations, copy number variations and translocations, as well as to perform clonal analysis of T and B cells. Gene expression 
analysis of immune and other relevant signatures using RNA sequencing, microarray and other 
methodologies (e.g., RNA-sequencing, Nanostring™, HTG EdSeq ™, in situ hybridization, etc.) 
will be also used as exploratory methodologies to identify expression of gene(s) associated to

outcome of patients. Finally, protein analysis of tissues’ lysates may be performed applying 
protein arrays (e.g., RPPA, multiplex ELISA, etc.), mass spectrometry and other techniques to identify protein(s) correlated with patients’ outcome.  
 
Storage, re- use and destruction of biological samples  
If the patient agrees, the remaining biomarker samples (tumor, blood) may be stored for up to  
15 years  and further analyzed to address scientific questions related to MEDI4736 and 
tremelimumab, findings related to the drug class or disease, as well as reagent and assay 
availability.  
 
Withdrawal of Informed Consent for donated biological samples  
Studydata  are protected  by the use of a SID number, which  is a specific  number for each subject. 
The investigators  are in  control of  the information that is needed  to connect a  study sample to a 
subject. A subjects consent to the use of data does not have a specific expiration date, but the 
subject may withdraw  consent  at any time by notifying the investigator.  If consent is withdrawn 
any samples collected prior to that time may  still be used but no additional data or samples will 
be collected unless specifically required to monitor safety of a subject.  
 
SAFETY REPORTING AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT  
6.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
Adverse Event - Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient administered a pharmaceutical product, medical treatment or procedure and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, 
for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
medical treatment or procedure whether or not considered possibly , probably or definitely 
related to the medicinal product.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Event  
An AE is “unexpected” when its nature (specificity), severity, or frequency are not consistent 
with (a) the known or foreseeable risk of AE associated with the research procedures 
described in the protocol, informed consent form or the investigator brochure.

Date: 17 May 2017 Page | 69  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following  outcomes: 
Death  
A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places the 
patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias or  convulsions that do not result  in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32). 
 
Important  medical  events  as defined  above, may also be considered  serious adverse events. 
Any important medical  event  can and should be reported  as an SAE  if deemed  appropriate 
by the Principal Investigator or the IND Sponsor, IND  Office.  
 
 
When there is doubt regarding an AE meeting the criteria for an SAE, the investigator should 
default to reporting the AE as an SAE. 
 
There are special circumstances in which an SAE reporting form is used to communicate 
important clinical trial safety observations that may not constitute an SAE.  
 
1. Pregnancy: Although pregnancy is not considered an SAE and is instead a normal 
human experience, all pregnancies reported  in the month before  or month after last 
investigational treatment must be reported to  sponsor.

1. Overdose : An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of 
any dose of a product that is considered both excessive and medically important. 
For reporting purposes, an overdose will be considered, regardless of adverse 
outcome, as an import ant medical event. All cases of overdose must be reported 
immediately to the sponsor.  
Definition of Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An
 AESI is one of scientific and medical interest specific to understanding of the 
investigational product and may require close monitoring and rapid communication by the 
investigator to the sponsor. An AESI may be serious or non-serious. The rapid reporting of 
AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand 
them in association with the use of this investigational product.  
• Diarrhea / Colitis and intestinal perforation  
• Pneumonitis / ILD  
• hepatitis / transaminase increases  
• Endocrinopathies (i.e. events of hypophysitis/hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, 
hyper- and hypothyroidism and type I diabetes mellitus) 
• Rash / Dermatitis  
• Nephritis / Blood creatinine increases  
• Pancreatitis / serum lipase and amylase increases   
• Myocarditis 
• Myositis / Polymyositis 
• Neuropathy / neuromuscular toxicity (e.g. Guillain- Barré, and myasthenia gravis)  
• Other inflammatory responses that are rare / less frequent with a potential immune -
mediated aetiology include, but are not limited to, pericarditis, sarcoidosis, uveitis and other events involving the eyeskin, haematological and rheumatological events, vasculitis, non-infectious meningitis and non- infectious encephalitis.  
• In addition, infusion -related reactions and hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions with 
a different underlying pharmacological aetiology are also considered AESIs.  
• Further information on these risks (e.g. presenting symptoms) can be found in the 
current version of the durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure. More specific guidelines 
for their evaluation and treatment are described in detail in the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines (please see Appendix 1). These guidelines have been prepared by the Sponsor to assist the Investigator in the exercise of his/her clinical judgment in treating these types of toxicities.  These guidelines apply to AEs considered causally related to the study drug/study regimen by the reporting investigator.  
Adverse Event Severity  
All AEs will be evaluated  according  to the NCI CTCAE  v4.03 (2010)

http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06- 14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf . 
For AEs not listed  in this reference scale,  severity  will be assessed  by the investigator according 
to the criteria in Table  8. 
 
Table  8 Adverse Event Severity  Assessment  
 
Grade 1 (Mild)  Requires minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with 
the patient’s daily activities.  
Grade 2 (Moderate)  Results in a low level of inconvenience or concern and 
may interfere with the patient’s functioning.  
Grade 3 (Severe)  Interrupts a patient’s usual daily activity, may be 
incapacitating and may require systemic drug therapy or 
other treatment.

Grade 4 (Life 
threatening)  Places the patient at immediate risk of death from the 
reaction as it occurred; it does not include a reaction that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
Grade 5 (Death)  Death  
 
 
Changes in the severity  of an AE should be documented to enable an assessment  of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity. Adverse events characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each episode. 
 
Relationship to Investigational Drug 
The relationship between an AE and the study treatment will be determined by  the investigator 
on the basis of his or her clinical judgment and the definitions in Table  9. 
 
Table  9 Assessment of Relationship  
 
Definitely related  AEs clearly attributable to study treatment administration  
Probably related  AEs for which there is a reasonable possibility of causal 
association to study treatment 
Possibly related  AEs for which there is confounding by comorbidities, medications 
or other considerations but for which it is not unreasonable that the 
AE may have been caused by study treatment It is not appropriate 
to invoke  
 
“you can’t rule it out.” 
Not related  AEs that are clearly not causally related to study treatment, or for 
which there is a clear alternative explanation  
AE = adverse event  
 
If there is any question whether or not an AE is possibly, probably or definitely related, the 
investigator should default to conservatism in categorization. Similarly, the investigator should 
default to conservatism by calling an AE an SAE if there is doubt regarding the serious nature 
of an AE.

Adverse Event Collection Period 
All enrolled patients will have periodic assessment of clinical and laboratory AEs. Please see 
Section 6.5 for guidelines on AE Reporting. 
 
Adverse Event Reporting  
At each study visit (including unscheduled visits), the investigator, or designee, will determine 
whether any AEs have occurred. Any AE that is possibly, probably or definitely  related  to study 
drug (section 6.3) will be reported in the patient’s medical record and on the AE CRF page  and 
each will be classified according to the criteria in Section 6.2 and 6.3. Any AEs that are grade 3 
and above (section 6.2) regardless of relationship, will be reported in the patient’s medical 
record and on the AE CRF page and each will be classified a ccording to the criteria in  Section  
6.2 and 6.3. If known, the diagnosis should be recorded, in preference to the listing  of individual 
signs and symptoms. Adverse event reporting for each patient starts when the patient signs the ICF and continues at all subsequent visits through the end-of- treatment visit. Any pre -existing 
conditions that are detected as part of the initial screening procedures will need to be reported in the medical history and not as an AE. However, pre -existing conditions that worsen after 
enrollment should be reported  as an AE. Adverse events will be reported to FDA  in accordance 
with the requirements outlined in 21 CFR 312.32. AESI’s will be expedited to regulatory 
authorities, study investigators and DMC.  
 
Each AE will also be assessed for meeting the criteria for a serious adverse event. If the AE 
meets the criteria of a SAE, expedited reporting must occur.  
 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting  the definition of a SAE  must 
be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures outlined in “The 
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy for 
Investigators on Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices”. Unless stated  
otherwise  in the protocol, all SAEs,  expected  or unexpected, must be reported  to the IND Office, 
regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge of the event).  
All life -threatening or fatal events, that are unexpected, and related to the study drug, must 
have a written report submitted within 24 hours (next working day) of knowledge of the event 
to the Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.  
 
If a SAE occurs and is deemed related or possible related (expected and unexpected), 
Medimmune will be notified within 5 days of awareness of the event. In particular, if the SAE

Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance: Durvalumab

Date: 17 May 2017 Page | 74  
 
is fatal, Medimmune must be notified within 24 hours, irrespective of the extent of available AE 
information. In the rare event that the investigator or designee does not become aware of the  
occurrence of a SAE  immediately,  the investigator or designee must report the event within 5 
days (non- fatal SAE’s) or 24 hours (fatal SAE’s) of their awareness and document the time of 
when his/her first awareness occurred. Institutional guidelines for SAE reporting will be followed in addition to the  above. 
 
Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be utilized for safety reporting to the IND Office and MDACC IRB . 
 
Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first protocol -specific 
intervention, until 90 days after the last dose of drug, unless the participant withdraws 
consent. Serious adverse events must be followed until clinical recovery is complete and 
laboratory tests have returned  to baseline,  progression  of the event  has stabilized,  or there

Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the 90 day time period that are 
related to the study treatment must be reported to the IND Office. This may include the 
development of a secondary malignancy.

participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. All patients (men and 
women) must sign an informed consent form documenting this discussion. 
 
All FCBP must have a negative pregnancy test within 3 days prior to the study treatment 
initiation. If the pregnancy test is positive, the subject must not be enrolled in the study.  
 
In addition, all FCBP  should be instructed  to contact  the investigator immediately  if they suspect 
they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) at any time during study 
participation.  
 
If following initiation of study treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a trial subject is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant within one month before or after study treatments will be 
permanently discontinued and the patient will be followed as possible by the investigator or 
designated health  care professional  to determine  pregnancy outcomes for both mother and baby. 
If a male patient enrolled in study has a female sexual partner who becomes pregnant after 
initiation of study, then the study subject should be asked permission for the investigator (or 
designated health care professional) to approach his partner for permission to follow -up with 
the pregnant partner to determine outcomes for both mother and  baby. 
 
Overdose 
An overdose is defined as a subject receiving a dose of investigational product in excess of that specified in the Investigator’s Brochure, and as specified in this protocol.  
 
If the overdose results in an AE, the AE must also be recorded  on the AE eCRF.  Overdose does 
not automatically make an AE serious, but if the consequences of the overdose are serious, for 
example death or hospitalization, the event is serious and must be reported as an SAE. The investigator will use clinical judgment to treat any overdose. 
 
 
Protocol Deviations 
A protocol deviation is any change, divergence or departure from  the study  design or procedures 
defined in the protocol such as the accidental  destruction  of a tissue biopsy  sample  intended for 
phenotyping to characterize the subject's type of tumor in order to determine study eligibility, 
or an accidental misread of a laboratory value as being within the reference range when it 
actually  is sufficiently  abnormal to preclude  study  participation by the subject.  
 
Important protocol deviations are a subset of protocol deviations that might significantly affect 
the completeness,  accuracy,  and/or reliability  of the study data or that might significantly  affect

a subject’s rights, safety or well being such as the PI prescribing or administering the wrong 
treatment, or the study subject being scheduled to return for follow -up intervention outside the 
protocol-dictated window as a convenience to the patient or study staff.  
 
The investigator is responsible for complying with and adhering to IRB procedures for reporting 
protocol deviations and violations. All protocol deviations should be documented and forwarded to Medimmune or its authorized representative on a yearly basis. All protocol violations will be reported as per MD Anderson’s institutional guidelines.  
 
Protocol deviations will be collected during the study, and reported to the IRBs yearly in the 
annual report.

STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
Statistical considerations  
Response to systemic therapy in metastatic/refractory disease is low and is less meaningful if 
not correlated with improvement in survival. For this reason, PFS has become an acceptable 
metric in the measurement of efficacy in sarcomas with refractory disease or in sarcomas with primary resistance to anthracycline -based chemotherapies. The objective data to support use of 
PFS as a primary end point in sarcomas was derived from a review of the EORTC sarcoma 
database by van Glabbeke et al in 2002 (46). In the EORTC analysis,  which  involved 12 clinical 
trials, patients with no prior treatment received experimental agents were compared to those with prior systemic treatment who were received experimental agents. In a multivariate analysis, 
patients with prior therapy obtained an improved PFS with active agents compared to inactive 
agents. For previously treated patients, an active agent was associated with a PFS  of

at least 39% and 14% at 3 months and 6 months, respectively. Inactive agents were  associated 
with a PFS of 21% and 8% at 3 months and 6 months, respectively.  
 
A concern with the use of PFS at 3 months as a primary endpoint for this study is whether 
response assessment at 3 months will fail to capture patients who may have delayed benefit from check -point inhibitors, however it has been shown that the majority of  patients with response to 
anti-PD-1 therapy obtained response within 12 weeks of drug initiation (9). 
 
The goal of this trial is to assess the efficacy of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab 
by evaluating progression- free rate at 12 weeks for each cohort.  
 
Design and sample size/power 
 
For cohort 3, 4 and 5, we will treat up to 25 patients within each cohort. The primary efficacy 
endpoint will be progression- free survival at 12 weeks (PFS 12 weeks). 12-week PFS is defined as 
evidence of stable disease or better 12 weeks after the initiation of therapy. In the meanwhile, we 
will also monitor the toxicity  of  the  agent (56). Toxicity  will  be  assessed  within  the  first 
two cycles of the treatment. If there is a high probability that the PFS 12 weeks is unlikely to be at 
least 40% or that the unacceptable toxicity rate (as described in section 3.2.2) is likely to be 
greater than 30%, the drug would not be considered of interest for further study. Formally if 
Pr(PFR 12 weeks < 0.40 | Data) > 0.90 or Pr(toxicity rate > 0.30 | Data) > 0.90, the corresponding 
cohort will be stopped. The assumed prior distribution for PFS 12 weeks is Beta (0.4, 0.6) and for 
toxicityis Beta (0.3, 0.7). The resulting prior means are 0.40 and 0.3 for PFS 12 weeks and toxicity 
rate, respectively, with one patient worth of information. Each of the disease cohorts will be 
monitored separately in cohorts of 5 patients after a minimum of 5 patients have completed two 
cycles, a summary will be submitted to the IND Office Medical Monitor after each cohort of 5 
patients . All patients who receive at least one study related treatment will be included in the 
analysis. Patients who are not evaluable for response to the treatment by 12 weeks post 
treatment initiation will be considered treatment failure. Patients who withdraw consent or become ineligible prior to receiving any study related treatment (full or partial dose) will be 
replaced. Consideration will be given to stop the cohort according to the following stopping boundaries.

For cohort 1, 2 and 6, since these include more than distinct subtypes, in order to assess anti- 
tumor activity of the treatment regimen within each histologic subtype, we will open enrollment simultaneously for each of the histologic subtypes but keep the maximum number of patients at 25 in each of these cohorts. The stopping boundaries for PFS
12 weeks futility monitoring or for 
excessive toxicity monitoring in Table 10 will be applied within each histologic subtype. For example, enrollment to vascular sar comas- Leiomyosarcomas will be stopped if none of the first 
5 patients with vascular sarcomas- Leiomyosarcomas were progression -free at12 weeks or 4 or 
more patients had the unacceptable toxicity. With 5 patients enrolled within each histologic subtype, the probabilities of observing one or more patients with 12-week PFS are 67.2%, 92.2% and 99% if the true 12-week PFS are 20%, 40%, and 60% while the probabilities of observing four or more patients with toxicities are 0.2%, 3.1% and 18.8% if the true toxicity rate are 15%, 30%, and 50%. If 10 patients with the same histologic subtype have been enrolled, the 
probabilities of observing three or more patients with 12- week PFS are 32.2%, 83.3% and 98.8% 
if the true 12 -week PFS are 20%, 40%, and 60% while the probabilities of observing six or more 
patients with toxicities are 0.1%, 4.7% and 37.7% if the true toxicity rate are 15%, 30%, and 50%. 
 
Sample size estimate 
The study consists of 6 cohorts arranged by histologic classifications. Within each cohort, a 
minimum of 5 patients (in cohorts 3, 4 and 5), 10 patients (cohort 2), 15 patients (cohort 1)  and 
25 (cohort 6) will be enrolled. The maximum number of patients in all the cohorts will be 25 
patients. Therefore, the minimum patients to be enrolled onto this trial will 65 patients and the maximum is 150 patients.  
 
Definitions of analysis sets  
The analysis of data will be based on different subsets according to the purpose of the analysis. 
 
Efficacy analysis set 
All patients who have received at least one dose of treatment (durvalumab and/or tremelimumab) and have disease reassessed will be considered evaluable for response.  Patients 
who drop out the study due to drug-related  toxicity  and/or death  before the time of first response 
assessment will be included in the denominator for the estimation of PFS at 12 weeks and 
response rate. 
 
Safety analysis set 
All patients who received at least 1 full or partial dose of durvalumab in combination with 
tremelimumab.

Outcome measures for analyses 
Primary Endpoint is PFS at 12 weeks. 
 
Seondary endpoints include 1) response rate (CR,PR) assessed by irRC and RECIST; 2) 
toxicities; 3) PFS and OS.  
 
Correlative endpoints include PD -1/PD -L1, immune panels including AIC, CD4, CD8 et al 
measured in tumor as well as in blood samples over time.  
 
Methods for statistical analyses  
Analysis of the primary variable(s) 
If a cohort is stopped early, this drug will not be considered of interest for future study for this 
cohort of patients. If all 25 patients are accrued, we will estimate both the PFS at12 weeks and 
toxicity rate and the corresponding 95% posterior credible  intervals. We will also apply a 
Bayesian hierarchical statistical model (57) to analyze the data from all six cohorts to borrow information from each other. 
 
Analysis of the secondary variable(s)  
PFS is defined as the time from treatment onset to either disease progression as defined by 
RECIST or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. OS is defined as the time from 
treatment onset to death. For events that have not occurred by the time of data analysis, times 
will be censored at the last contact at which the patient was known to be progression -free for 
PFS, or the last time the patient was known to be alive for OS. PFS and OS will be estimated 
using the Kaplan -Meier  method (58).  Log-rank test (59) will be performed  to test the difference 
in survival between  groups. Regression  analyses of survival data based  on the Cox proportional 
hazards model (60) will be conducted on PFS or OS. The proportional hazards assumption will 
be evaluated graphically and analytically, and regression diagnostics (e.g., martingale and 
Shoenfeld residuals) will be examined to ensure that the models are appropriate.  
 
Toxicity data will be summarized by frequency tables. For the toxicity endpoint, per- treated 
analysis will be used to include any patient who received the treatment regardless of the eligibility nor the duration or dose of the treatment received. Toxicity rate will be estimated with 
95% credible interval.  
 
Exploratory data analysis and graphical methods will be applied to examine the distribution of 
the biomarker data, error checking, and outlier identification. Range check and consistency 
check  will be applied to ensure the data quality. Standard distribution  plots  such as the histogram 
and box- plot will be applied. A more  versatile BLiP  plot will be used to facilitate  the plotting

of both discrete and continuous data. Since PD -1/PD -L1 IHC expression and the immune 
correlates will be measured  at baseline and multiple  post treatment time points. T- test/ANOVA 
or their nonparametric countparts, Wilcoxon rank- sum test/Kruskal -Wallis test will be used to 
detect  differences of the biomarkers  between  groups (1) Linear  mixed  effect  models for repeated 
measures analysis (61) will be employed to assess the change of the biomarkers over time with 
multi- covariates including disease characteristics (tumor stage, site, pathology), and other 
patient prognostic factors. Appropriate transformation of the outcome assessment values will be used to satisfy the normality assumption of linear mixed effect model.

1. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  
a. Brief Summary  
The purpose of the research study is to test a new approach for  treating patients with 
snoring and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). A  special device (NAS -nasal stent) appears 
to be a useful alternative  or additive treatment for patients with OSA.  
b. Objectives  
We hope to learn through this study if this device provides a better  alternative treatment 
for obsturctive sleep apnea and snoring.  
c. Rationale for Research in Humans  
2. STUDY PROCEDURES  
a. Procedures  
This research study is seeking to enroll up to 30 participants  with OSA  and snoring. The 
enrollment will be at Stanford Sleep Medicine  Center.  The NAS (straight type ) supports 
the soft palate from "collapsing"  by supporting it physica lly, as well as securing the 
passage of  airflow both inside and outside of the tube.  Participants in the proposed study 
will undergo any or all of the  following procedures.  
 
After the consent process (30 min ), each participant will be asked  to complete eith er 
paper questionnaires which inquires about his  or her demographic information and 
medical history (Sleep  Disorders Questionnaire, 30 min ) and level of daytime sleepiness  
in various situations (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, 5 min ) or an  electronic questionnaire 
(Alliance Sleep Questionnaire, 20 min ). 
 
Each participant will be asked to submit to an initial evaluation  (60 min ), which consists 
of a discussion of the participant's  sleep habits and problems, medical history of 
participant and  family, review of systems, medications, education, employment, and  
personal habits. A general physical examination, including but not  limited to examination 
of the mouth and throat, and measurements  of his or her weight and height; 
circumference of neck, wa ist, and  hip; pulse and respiration rate; and blood pressure.  
 
The participants will undergo two sleep studies: one sleep study  at our center prior to 
using the NAS device (Baseline ) and another  after 7 days of use of the device at their 
October 27,  2016   Page 2 of 10 homes (Treatment ). The  participants will wear the NAS device during the sec ond sleep  
study.  
 
The sleep study will be conducted in routine fashion, with  recording electrodes and 
equipment attached to the participant to  enable monitoring of the electroencephalogram 
(EEG, C3 -A2 and C4 - A1, O2 -A1 and O1 -A2), electro -oculogram (EOG, ROC -A1, 
LOC -A2), chin and anterior tibialis electromyograms (EMG ), heart rate by  two-lead 
electrocardiogram (EKG ), snoring intensity (anterior n eck microphone ), nasal pressure 
(nasal cannula ), oral  airflow (thermocouple ), thoracic and abdominal movement 
(inductance  plethysmography bands ), and oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry ). The 
duration of the application of all of these electrodes and  recordin g devices to the 
participant is approximately 1.5 hours.  The polysomnogram will be scheduled to allow at 
least 7 hours but  no more than 9 hours of time in bed for the participant during the  night.  
 
The participants will be provided the following instructions for  handling the NAS device:  
-Before handling the NAS, wash hands and nails thoroughly with  
soap. Make sure to thoroughly rinse off the soap as we ll. 
-Check NAS package carefully for breakage on the package. In case  
of breakage, do not use and contact the clinical research staff.  
-Check right or left nostril for intended insertion  
-Open NAS package, and take out NAS device.  
-Insert the tube to the a ppropriate side and slide NAS device  
slowly into the nasal airway.  
-Clip the stopper on to the nasal septum / bridge to secure the  
device.  
-Open the mouth in front of a mirror; check that there is the tip  
of the NAS device showing 3mm from the soft palate.  
-Go to sleep with the NAS applied.  
-Remove the NAS through nose and dispose once awake.  
-Limit use of this device to a maximum of 10 hours. Always dispose  after use, and do not 
re-use. Use within six months.  
 
Participants will have the optio n to to receive the nasal device  after the second sleep 
study. The  patient will be allowed to receive complimentary nasal stents  until the time the 
device becomes commercially available. During this  time, each participant will be asked 
to complete and subm it the  Epworth Sleepiness Scale every three months.  
 
-Close out visit  
 
After completion of the first sleep study (baseline ) and second  sleep  study (treatment ), 
subject will be asked to come back for a  follow -up visit to discuss the results of his/h er 
sleep studies with the  study  doctor, Dr. Kushida. During this visit, the study doctor or  
research  coordinator will ask the subject to place the nasal stent into  his/her nostril, and 
the PI or research coordinator will then take  pictures of the back of the subject's mout h, 
where the nasal stent  should be resting. Subject's face will not be included in the  photos. 
If after meeting with the study doctor and the subject  would  like to try the nasal stent in a 
different size, the subject may  have  a repeat treatment PSG.

The above procedures are in clinical use at our center.  We are taking all necessary 
precautions for any risk that may occur  in this clinical study.  
c. Use of Deception in the Study  
Not Applicable  
d. Use of Audio and Video Recordings  
Participants will be videotaped during the sleep study as per our  usual sleep clinic 
protocol. The videotapes will be kept for 7 years  and then destroyed.  
e. Alternative Procedures or Courses of Treatment  
Alternative treatments for obstructive sleep apnea will be  discussed with the participant, 
including continuous positive  airway pressure (CPAP ), upper airway surgery, and oral 
appliance  therapy. There are risks/benefits to all these alternative  treatments t hat will be 
discussed with the participants; these are  standard of care treatments.  
f. Will it be possible to continue the more (most) appropriate therapy for the 
participant(s) after the conclusion of the study?  
Yes 
g. Study Endpoint (s) 
The study will end after 30 participants are completed.  
3. BACKGROUND   
a. Past Experimental and/or Clinical Findings  
Nasal airway stents  have been tried in sample populations with mixed  results. The 
sponsor of the proposed study has developed several  versions of their device, of which 
the device for the proposed study  appears to be the most promising as tested in a few 
subjects by the  spon sor in an internal study.

8. PARTICIPANT POPULATION  
a. Planned Enrollment  
Our plan is to enroll 30 patients for the NAS study at Stanford.  Stanford will be the only 
site. The population will be 18 years of age and older with snoring and obstructive sleep 
apnea and exclusion  criteria of adults with body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 
kg/m2.  
b. Age, Gender, and Ethnic Background  
Age range is 18 years and older. There are no gender or ethnic background specific 
criteria.  
c. Vulnerable Population s 
- No children will be asked to participate in the study.  
- Pregnant women, homeless and economically disadvantaged people  will be excluded.  
- Persons who are not able to comprehen d or understand English.  
- Persons who are unable to follow instructions will be excluded.  
- Persons with body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2 will be excluded.  
d. Rationale for Exclusion of Certain Populations  
No children will be included in the study, since standard -of-care treatment for sleep 
disorder management in  children is less well defined and standardized than that of adults . 
October 27,  2016   Page 6 of 10 e. Stanford Populations  
Laboratory personnel, employees, and/or students will not be excluded from the study, 
since they will be  part of our normal clinic population. No specific number or share of 
laboratory personnel, employees,  and/or students can be part of the study.  
 
Those participants in this research study will also be eligible for the standard study 
cooperation fee of $700  and the option of receiving nasal stents after their second sleep 
study.  
 
Payments may only be made to U.S. citizens, legal resident aliens, and those who have a 
work eligible visa.  
f. Healthy Vol unteers  
Not Applicable  
g. Recruitment Details  
Potential participants will be recruited from the Stanford Sleep Medicine Center clinic 
population as  identified via chart review by the research staff. During their clinic visit, 
only someone with a treating  relationship will initially approach the potential subject and, 
after they have indicated that they are  interested in more inf ormation about the study, 
they will contact the research staff or agree to allow their  physician to provide their 
contact information to the research personnel.  
 
In addition, recruitment flyers will be posted in local businesses, as well as running a 
subjec t recruitment  newspaper ad to obtain subjects outside of the Stanford Sleep 
Medicine Center clinic population. The  phone number and email address of the research 
coordinator will be on the ads for the interested participant  to contact.  
h. Eligibility Criteria  
i. Inclusion Criteria  
The population under study will be clinical outpatients 18 years of age or older with 
symptoms of  obstructive sleep apnea and snoring, and with body mass index less 
than 30 kg/m2.  
ii. Exclusion Criteria  
Children, pregnant women, homeless, economically disadvantaged individuals, and 
those who are unable to  comprehend or understand English, or follow instructions 
will be excluded. Persons with body mass index  greater than 30 kg/m2 will also be 
excluded.  
i. Screening Procedures  
Patients at age over 18 will be screened. Clinical outpatients will be recruited from our 
normal clinic  population. No telephone screening will be performed. In addition, flyers 
will be pos ted to recruit subjects  outside of our normal clinic population.  
October 27,  2016   Page 7 of 10 j. Participation in Multiple Protocols  
Our research team will ask this question, and this question will be on our informed 
consent form. Patients  will be given the choice as to whether they want to participate in 
this study if they are already enrolled in  another study.  
k. Payments to Participants  
The patient will be paid to participate in this research study. It is a cooperation fee of 
$700. The payments  will be prorated based on the length  of participation. Payments may 
only be made to U.S. citizens, legal  resident aliens, and those who have a work eligible 
visa. Patients may need to provide their social security  number to receive payment.  
 
Participants will have the option to receive the na sal device after the second sleep study. 
The participant  will be allowed to receive complimentary nasal stents until the time the 
device becomes commercially  available.  
l. Costs to Participants  
There is no cost for participating in this study, other than basic expenses like 
transportation and the personal  time it will take to come to all of the study visits. The 
study will pay for t hose services, supplies,  procedures, and care associated with the study 
that are not a part of routine medical care. The patient will be  responsible for any co -
payments and/or deductibles as required by your insurance.  
m. Planned Duration  of the Study  
The consenting time will take about 15 minutes.  
 
This research study is expected to last approximately one year.  The active participation is 
up to a year.  The time for  the sleep questions will be about 30 minutes - the sleepiness 
scale will take about 5 minutes  and the electronic questionnaire will take approx. 20 Min.  
The limit use of this device is a maximum of 10 hours - every night throughout the whole 
night for 7 d ays. At baseline and day 8 the patient will be requested to have sleep studies 
(without the NAS at baseline and  while wearing the NAS at day 8 ). 
9. RISKS 
a. Potential Risks  
i. Investigational devices  
If you insert the NAS into the nostril there can be a little nose bleeding because of the 
damage of the  mucous membrane while inserting the NAS device.  
 
There may be some soreness and swelling due to the  pressure of the device.  
ii. Investigational drugs 
Not Applicable  
iii. Commercially available drugs, biologics, reagents or chemicals  
October 27,  2016   Page 8 of 10 Commercially available drugs will be used as part of normal sleep disorder treatment. 
This is not a clinical  trial to test medications, so routine medications for the treatment of 
sleep disorders will be prescribed by the  subject's physician as part of their clinical care 
only.  
iv. Procedures  
Insertion of the NAS tube to the appropriate side of the nostril.  
v. Radioisotopes/radiation -producing mac hines  
Not Applicable  
vi. Physical  well-being  
There can be a little nose bleeding because of the damage of the mucous membrane.  
 
There may be some soreness and swelling due to the pressure of the device.  
vii. Psych ological  well-being

agent, or safe  therapeutic agent such as the use of an FDA approved drug or device.  
b. International Research  Risk Procedures  
Not Applicable  
c. Procedures to Minimize Risk  
This is a low -risk study, given that the participants will have procedures described above 
that are part of  normal routine medical care.  
 
Protections Against Risks  
 
Treatment: We will have close monitoring of the particip ants while they are on treatment, 
including  regularly scheduled visits to our center to maintain safety and adherence.  
Testing Information: We will keep all of the information collected about the participants 
in locked files at  our center. For computerized  data, the data will be stored in password -
protected computers at our center.  
 
Further, staff will have completed human subjects training.  
October 27,  2016   Page 9 of 10 d. Study Conclusion  
The study will terminate when we have successfu lly enrolled 30 patients for the NAS 
study.  
 
The Protocol Director will be monitoring all safety data from Stanford participants, and 
will determine if it  remains safe for a subject to continue. A subject would be 
discontinued from the protocol at any time if it is  determined that subject safety is at risk. 
The protocol director and/or study coordinator will be reachable by  cell phone 24/7 by 
subjects.  
 
Regarding an adverse/unexpected event, the lab personnel typically become aware of the 
event directly from  the participant or the participant's healthcare provider. Upon 
becoming aware of an adverse event, the  principal investigator should assess whether the 
adverse event represents an unanticipated problem:  
1. unexpected;  
2. related or possibly related to part icipation in the research; and  
3. serious or otherwise one that suggests that the research places subjects or others at a 
greater risk of  physical or psychological harm than was previously known or recognized.  
e. Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMC)  
i. Data and/or events subject to review  
Data Collected From the P articipant. Data from forms, questionnaires, and interviews 
will be entered  into a secure, password -protected web portal. All data will also be 
collected and transferred in  compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA ). 
ii. Person(s) responsible for Data and Safety Monit oring  
The protocol director  
iii. Frequency of DSMB meetings

10. BENEFITS  
Study participants will not receive direct benefit; however future  sleep medicine patients may 
benefit.  This information about NAS (nasal stent) appears to be a use ful alternative or additive 
treatment for patients with OSA. We hope  to gain through this study if this new device provides a 
better or  alternative treatment of OSA.  
11. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
All participant information  and specimens are  handle d in compliance with the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  and privacy policies of Stanford University, Stanford

 v1.1, March 30, 2017                  Page 7 of 32  1.0 BACKGROUND  Atrial Fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained arrhythmia in the United States, has profound public health implications: the lifetime risk of AF is 1 in 4, the disease affects several million Americans, and it is the most common cause of embolic stroke.1-3 Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of AF is still poorly understood and has multiple influences, with ethanol likely being one of particular importance. Ethanol is the most commonly consumed drug in the United States. In the 2001 US National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, 84% of people surveyed above the age of 12 admitted to having consumed ethanol in the past, with a quarter of men, and nearly a fifth of women, admitting to at least one episode of binge ethanol drinking (>5 drinks in a single sitting) during the previous month.4 The mechanism(s) by which ethanol increases the risk for AF, or “triggers” AF in certain individuals are unknown.   The widest body of literature is epidemiological, and those studies have suggested an association between ethanol use and the risk for AF since the initial cases of “holiday heart” were described in the 1970s5. The patients in the initial case reports were generally male, middle-aged or younger chronic alcoholics who were without structural heart disease. The temporal association of acute onset paroxysmal AF with ethanol binges, in patients with otherwise normal hearts, led to the premise that AF paroxysms could be related to ethanol use. This premise was brought into question when large epidemiologic studies, such as the Framingham Heart Study, the Manitoba Follow-up Study, and the Renfrew/Paisley study, found no association between chronic ethanol use and AF6-8. Later studies, such as the Copenhagen Heart Study and a reanalysis of the Framingham cohort, demonstrated that when controlled for the quantity of ethanol consumed and sex, an association with chronic and paroxysmal AF was seen with moderate to heavy ethanol use (>3 drinks per day) in men9-12. From these studies it is apparent that the effect of ethanol is both multifactorial and complex. The case series and anecdotal evidence suggest that acute ethanol binging can induce temporary paroxysms of AF in younger patients without structural heart changes (consistent with acute electrophysiologic changes)5, 13, 14, while the epidemiological evidence suggests that chronic moderate to heavy ethanol use in men is associated with more chronic AF (consistent with a structural effect on the atria)9-12. It is unclear if these two conditions are part of continuum of risk or if they represent the diverse effects that ethanol may have on different patient populations. In order to investigate the mechanistic relationship between acute ethanol use and AF, we will perform a study of the acute electrical effects of ethanol in a non-alcoholic patient population with baseline paroxysmal AF.  1.1 Previous Study Data   The prevailing theory is that a PAC triggers AF, representing multiple, partially-reentrant wavelets. As experiments have been limited to animal models, a few small comparative observational (not experimental) studies in humans, and mechanistic concepts inferred by the success of certain ablation procedures, there is no human experimental model for in vivo atrial EP changes in AF. The data suggest that three readily measurable EP properties are important in the initiation and perpetuation of AF: automaticity, the effective refractory period (ERP), also reflected in the action potential duration (APD), and conduction velocity.  The changing nature of ERP (or APD) relative to the previous diastolic interval, a property called restitution, may be critical to the initiation of fibrillation. There is some evidence that when the restitution curve becomes steep (>1), meaning that the ERP (or APD) shortens disproportionate to the diastolic interval, susceptibility to fibrillation is particularly enhanced. No human study has demonstrated a causal relationship wherein a change in restitution leads to a greater propensity to AF. In isolated animal myocardial tissue preparations, ethanol consistently reduces APD.

 v1.1, March 30, 2017                  Page 8 of 32  Intracoronary ethanol prolongs ventricular conduction times in canine models.    Small (n<15) case series describing invasive EP studies before and after oral ethanol in humans were performed decades ago. The following was observed: in 10 habitual drinkers, oral whiskey resulted in a decrease in the atrial ERP that did not reach statistical significance; atrial arrhythmias could be induced with atrial extra stimulus pacing in 5 after, but not before, drinking whiskey. In 14 patients, whiskey resulted in an increase in atrial conduction time and a decrease in the ventricular ERP. And in 14 patients, whiskey resulted in the His-Purkinje system delay, and sustained atrial arrhythmias could be induced in 4 of them. Our prior study of 48 consecutive patients undergoing a standard questionnaire and right atrial ERP measurements during invasive EP studies found that greater average ethanol intake was associated with a shorter right atrial ERP.  Utilizing the protocol detailed here, we have successfully obtained pilot data in 3 patients during AF ablation procedures. For the first patient, the PK model achieved a breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) of between 0.079-0.082% within 20 minutes, with successful clamping within that range for the duration of the experiments. No pacing maneuvers were performed in the first patient in order to focus on safety and feasibility of the ethanol infusion. With EP testing, patient 2 exhibited a 45 ms decrease in the proximal CS ERP; while no AF was observed with pacing prior to ethanol, AF was reproducibly observed during pacing from both upper pulmonary veins after ethanol. Patient 3 exhibited an 85 ms drop in the left upper pulmonary vein ERP after ethanol, with repeatedly induced AF after (but not before) the ethanol was administered. All 3 patients exhibited normal wound healing and recovery without complication. Thus, our experience with 3 patients receiving intravenous ethanol undergoing AF ablation procedures revealed no complications and normal recovery and wound healing.  This important preliminary data demonstrates: 1) The feasibility of delivering IV ethanol and serial EP assessments in patients undergoing invasive AF ablation procedures; 2) Our ability to utilize the BrAC method; 3) Dramatic changes in ERPs and AF inducibility in the two patients undergoing pacing maneuvers; 4) The safety of these experiments in patients undergoing AF ablation procedures.  2.0  INVESTIGATION PLAN  2.1 Study Design  This study is a randomized single-center single-blinded placebo controlled trial of patients age 21-90 with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. This study will be conducted at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Medical Center. One hundred patients will be enrolled and will receive the study infusion (alcohol or placebo infusion).  2.2 Randomization and Treatment Groups  Participants will be allocated (1:1) to a study assignment, using alternating blocked randomization (in blocks of five). Participants will be assigned to either the Ethanol Infusion group or to the Placebo Infusion group.   2.3   Blinding  To preserve blinding to infusion assignment, as much as possible, the following individuals will be blinded, during the trial: • Study participants

Treatment group assignment will not be indicated on the infusion bags.  2.4 Study Visits and Windows  After screening and eligibility has been determined, interested participants will be consented at either their pre-procedure, standard of care CT scan, or another pre-procedure appointment at UCSF Medical Center. At this point, questionnaires addressing alcohol consumption, triggers of AF, and medical history will be administered by the research team member performing the consent process.  See Figure 1 for study flow.    Safety follow-up will be performed by chart review at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-procedure, when AF ablation patients normally return to clinic. If participants have no scheduled clinic appointment within the visit window (+/- 30 days for 3 and 6 months, + 6 months and - 30 days for 12 month), a member of the research team will attempt to contact the participant by phone to gather follow-up information. The clinical site will make every possible effort to ensure that each study visit is conducted within the specified window.  Table 1.

Specifically, we seek to determine the electrophysiological effects of acute ethanol exposure on atrial myocardium via a randomized trial of intravenous ethanol versus placebo in paroxysmal AF patients.  Study Aims:  1.  To assess the acute effects of intravenous ethanol administration on the atrial effective refractory period (AERP) and atrial conduction velocity of in vivo human atrial myocardium.   Hypothesis: Intravenous administration of ethanol decreases AERP and atrial conduction velocity.   2.  To assess the acute effects of intravenous ethanol administration on the inducibility of AF of in vivo human atria.   Hypothesis: Intravenous administration of ethanol increases in vivo susceptibility to AF.    2.6  Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  2.6.1  Inclusion Criteria  1. Aged 21-90 2.

Propofol, remifentanil and nitrous oxide may be used at induction, with cis-atracurium for paralysis.  Prior to transseptal access, nitrous oxide and cis-atracurium should be turned off, though propofol and remifentanil infusions can continue. From transseptal access through the end of the experimental portion of the procedure, only a propofol infusion may be used.  If remifentanil is necessary after transseptal access, the anesthesia team may also use remifentinal so long as remifentinal is also infused for the reminder of the experimental portion of the procedure to ensure consistency.  Phenylephrine may be titrated throughout the procedure to maintain a mean arterial pressure above 70 mmHg.   The following medications may not be used until after completion of the experimental portion: benzodiazepines, fentanyl, rocuronium, succinylcholine, ketamine, scopolamine, and inhaled anesthetics other than nitrous oxide.  Only in the case of an emergency, may anticholinergics be used.  3.2 Catheter Placement  Following the initiation of sedation, intra-cardiac multipolar electrocatheters will be placed in the following positions under fluoroscopic guidance: decapolar catheter in the coronary sinus (CS), decapolar catheter along the crista terminalis, quadripolar catheter along the medial tricuspid annulus at the position of the His bundle, duodecapolar circular catheter in the left upper pulmonary vein, and quadripolar ablation catheter in the right upper pulmonary vein. If the ablation procedure were a cryoballoon PVI, four, instead of five, catheters will be used: decapolar catheter in the coronary sinus (CS), decapolar catheter along the crista terminalis, quadripolar catheter along the medial tricuspid annulus at the position of the His bundle, and cryoballoon catheter in the left upper pulmonary vein. (See Operations Manual for details)  Catheter repositioning should be avoided to prevent disrupting post-procedure conduction time measurements.  Prior to transseptal access, the alcohol or placebo solution will be connected to minimize left atrial time.   3.3 Pre-Infusion EP Study  Immediately following catheter placement, a one-minute premature atrial contraction (PAC) count will be conducted. AERP measurements will then be taken at the following bipoles: CS proximal, CS distal, high right atrium (crista terminalis catheter), left upper pulmonary vein, and right upper pulmonary vein. The AERP will be obtained by an incremental technique using a 600 ms drive cycle length for 8 beats (S1) at twice pacing threshold with incremental steps for the atrial extrastimuli (S2). The first drive train at each location should begin with an atrial extrastimuli (S2) of 140 ms, which is not expected to result in atrial capture. Once the first atrial capture is achieved, the S2 will be decreased by 5 ms. AERP will be defined as the longest S1-S2 interval that fails to result in atrial capture. (See Operations Manual for details)

 v1.1, March 30, 2017                  Page 13 of 32    3.4 Infusion  After the first EP study, the intravenous ethanol or placebo infusion will be initiated while the left atrial anatomic map is being constructed to reduce time added to the ablation procedure and minimize risk.  The infusion is run by an iMED Gemini PC-2TX pump connected to and controlled by the CAIS 2.0 computer software.  The ethanol infusion will consist of a 6% volume/volume ethanol solution in 0.45% saline titrated by the BrAC quick clamp method until a steady state is achieved at a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08%. The mean time to achieving this steady state is regulated by the CAIS 2.0 software to be approximately 20 minutes.  Infusion rates are determined by the patient’s height, weight, age, and sex, but are automatically adjusted depending on the patient’s breath alcohol measurements, which are taken every three to four minutes until steady state is reached.   Patients assigned to the placebo group will receive 5% dextrose (D5) in 0.45% saline.  BrAC measurements will be obtained at identical intervals for all participants; BrAC measurements will be randomly generated within two standard deviations of the predicted values calculated by the CAIS 2.0 software based on height, weight, age, and sex.  The randomly generated BrAC values will be input into the CAIS 2.0 software, as for patients receiving an alcohol infusion, and the infusion rates will be automatically adjusted accordingly.   Once the BrAC reading is ±0.002% from 0.080% (steady state), BrAC measurements will be taken every 10 minutes and input into the CAIS 2.0 software. Breath alcohol measurements will be taken using the Intoximeters Alco Sensor IV fitted with a one-way valve adaptor for intubated patients. (See Operations Manual for details)  3.5 Post-Infusion EP Study  As soon as the blood alcohol content reaches a steady state of 0.080% ±0.002%, a one-minute premature atrial contraction (PAC) count will be conducted.  AERP measurements will then be taken at the following bipoles: CS proximal, CS distal, high right atrium (crista terminalis catheter), left upper pulmonary vein, and right upper pulmonary vein.  The AERP will be obtained by an incremental technique using a 600 ms drive cycle length for 8 beats (S1) at twice pacing threshold with incremental steps for the atrial extrastimuli (S2).  The first drive train at each location should begin with an atrial extrastimuli (S2) of 140 ms, which is not expected to result in atrial capture.  Once the first atrial capture is achieved, the S2 will be decreased by 5 ms.  AERP will be defined as the longest S1-S2 interval that fails to result in atrial capture. (See Operations Manual for details)  Following the PAC count and AERP measurements, a phenylephrine infusion will be started prior to the initiation of the isoproterenol infusion to maintain a mean arterial pressure of >60 mmHg.  Isoproterenol hydrochloride will then be infused at the following rates for 2 minutes each: 3 mcg/min, 6 mcg/min, 12 mcg/min, and 20 mcg/min.  If AF or another arrhythmia initiates at any point during the isoproterenol infusion and is sustained over 30 seconds, the isoproterenol infusion will be stopped, the rhythm documented, and the study terminated.   If neither AF nor another arrhythmia lasting over 30 seconds occurs after 2 minutes of 20 mcg/min isoproterenol infusion, the isoproterenol infusion will be stopped.  Once the heart rate falls below 100 bpm, up to 3 bursts of rapid atrial pacing will be performed from the CS proximal bipole.  If AF or another arrhythmia initiates at any point during the burst pacing and is sustained over 30 seconds, the study will be terminated and the rhythm documented.

The Investigator will record details from the study treatment procedure (e.g., pre-procedure medications, details regarding pericardial and transseptal access, and fluoroscopy time) and will indicate whether the study procedure was completed as intended.   4.0 PARTICIPANT EARLY TERMINATION   Full details regarding procedures for early termination will be outlined in the Operations Manual.  4.1 Untreated Randomized Participants  After randomization, if an exclusionary criterion is identified prior to or at the start of the study procedure, the participant will not undergo the study infusion procedure.  Randomized participants may be early terminated, prior to commencing the study procedure, and will not receive the study infusion if any of the following study exclusions are identified:   • Participants who present in AF sustained >1 week  • If a participant does not present in sinus rhythm at the procedure, but he or she has proven to be in sinus rhythm at the enrollment visit, it is up to the attending whether or not to cardiovert the patient and proceed with study protocol.  If the participant is to be cardioverted, the cardioversion should take place prior to transseptal puncture and following right catheter placement to minimize potential effects on AERP and conduction times.  If a second AF episode initiates and is sustained over 2 minutes prior to initiation of study procedure, the study will be aborted.  These participants will be considered as “Untreated Participants”.  Unrandomized participants who do not commence/receive the study infusion will not continue in follow-up and will not be included in analyses.   4.2  Unsuccessfully Treated Participants  After enrollment, if the study infusion commenced and was stopped and/or determined by the study Principal Investigator to be unsuccessful (i.e., immediately after the procedure, the investigator determines that the protocol was not completely executed) for any reason, the participant will continue in follow-up.   4.2.1 Early Stopping of Study Infusion Protocol ONLY  If the study infusion commenced and the participant develops AF that is sustained over 2 minutes during study procedure (excluding the AF susceptibility testing section), the patient should be cardioverted to sinus rhythm, at the discretion of his or her attending physician.  If a second AF episode initiates and is sustained over 2 minutes, the study will be stopped.  If a participant develops a non-AF tachyarrhythmia that persists over 2 minutes, it will be up to the attending physician to map and/or ablate the rhythms.   If the study infusion (ethanol or placebo) protocol commenced prior to AF development, the participant will not be early terminated and will continue in follow-up.  These participants will be considered as “Unsuccessfully Treated Participants”.

Participants who discontinue follow-up at any time after study treatment will be included in analyses.  4.4  Other Early Terminations  Participants who discontinue follow-up at any time after study treatment will be included in analyses.  Lost to Follow-Up: If a participant fails to return for at least one follow up visit (3, 6, and 12 months post-procedure) and cannot be reached by phone within the visit windows, the participant will be designated an early termination. The study personnel will show "due diligence" by documenting in the source documents, all steps taken to contact the participant, e.g., dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. Vital status for participants lost to follow-up may be later obtained using outside records/death registries.   Principal Investigator Determination: Participants should also be early terminated at any time if the Principal Investigator concludes that it would be in the participant’s best interest for any reason. Protocol deviations should not lead to early termination unless they indicate a significant risk to the participant’s safety.   5.0  STUDY PROCEDURES  Table 2 provides an overview of the evaluations to be performed at each of the study visits.

Therefore, participants must be consented and randomized at least 1 day prior to the scheduled procedure.   Baseline measures will include:  • Inclusion/Exclusion criteria assessment • Demographics and medical history • World Health Organization AUDIT questionnaire • CARDIA alcohol use questionnaire (shortened version) • Vital signs • Infusion, procedure, BrAC, and EP study measurements • Arrhythmia episodes pre/during/post-procedure • Adverse event assessment  5.2  Follow-up Visits (Months 3, 6, and 12)   Following an ablation, patients usually return to clinic at 3, 6, and 12 months post-procedure as per standard of care.  HOLIDAY safety follow-up data will be collected by chart review.  We will collect data on targeted AEs, serious, unexpected AEs, use of antiarrhythmic drugs, use of anticoagulation, incidence and burden of AF or atrial flutter, incidence of ablation or cardioversion, and emergency room visits since the last visit. Participants who do not return to clinic at 3, 6, and 12 months will be contacted by the Study Coordinator to conduct the visit by phone.    Follow-Up Visit measures will include: • Medication use • Arrhythmia episodes  • Cardioversions/ablations  • Adverse event assessment  5.3  Targeted Concomitant Medications  Current/regular use (since their last study visit) of a specific list of concomitant medications/therapies must be documented at Baseline (pre-study treatment) and at all follow-up visits. Medication data will be collected by chart review and will include type of medication, 
HOLIDAY Protocol  
 v1.1, March 30, 2017                  Page 17 of 32  frequency, and dosage. The list of targeted medications/therapies includes cardiovascular-related medications (e.g., anticoagulants and antiarrhythmics).  5.4  Targeted Adverse Event (AE) and Serious Unexpected Adverse Event (SAE) Evaluation and Reporting  An adverse event is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition occurring after initiation of the study treatment, even if the event is not considered to be related to study treatment.  Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study treatment are only considered AEs if they worsen after starting study treatment (or any procedures specified in the study protocol).   A targeted adverse event (AE) is an event that may be reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of the study procedures or study participation or is part of the normal disease process or progression. Specific targeted AEs are documented in detail in the Operations Manual.   A serious unexpected adverse event (SAE) is defined as being unexpected if the event exceeds the nature, severity or frequency described in the current IRB Application, protocol, and consent form.  An unexpected AE also includes any AE that meets any of the following criteria: § Results in subject withdrawal from study participation, or  § Due to a deviation from the IRB approved study protocol  After completion of the study treatment (at the Baseline Visit) and at all follow-up visits, safety evaluations will include monitoring for targeted adverse events and recording all serious adverse events for the assessment of the secondary exploratory study objective.   Information about targeted adverse events, whether volunteered by the subject, discovered by Principal Investigator questioning, or other means, will be collected and recorded and followed as appropriate.   As possible, each targeted adverse event will be described by: ● duration (start and end dates), ● severity grade (mild, moderate, severe),  ● relationship to the study treatment and/or procedure (suspected/not suspected), ● action(s) taken and, as relevant, the outcome.  Even though planned/anticipated pregnancy is a study exclusion, pregnancy during follow-up may occur. If a female study participant should report pregnancy, this should be reported on a Protocol Deviation CRF. The pregnancy should be followed up to determine details of birth, outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary abortion, the presence or absence of any birth defects or congenital abnormalities, or any maternal/newborn hazards.   6.0 RISKS AND BENEFITS  6.1  Potential Risks  The primary risk to participants involves the receipt of IV ethanol. The procedure for IV ethanol infusion is well described and has previously been used for studies in the intoxication literature.86-88  The target blood alcohol level of 0.08% that will be achieved is the legal limit for driving in California, and is equivalent to approximately 4 drinks of ethanol in a 180 pound man (equivalent to moderately heavy social drinking in one sitting).  The use of IV ethanol in clinical settings is well established, with a long history of use in the treatment of such conditions as 
HOLIDAY Protocol  
 v1.1, March 30, 2017                  Page 18 of 32  methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning. The blood alcohol levels that have been used in such situations (0.1 to 0.2%) are higher than the level that we will use in our study (0.08%).156, 157  Side effects from the ethanol infusion at our targeted dose may include mild headache, but it is unlikely to cause nausea and vomiting.  Early studies with high dose IV ethanol infusions used for surgical anesthesia in the 1960s targeted to blood ethanol concentrations of 0.2 to 0.4% resulted in dizziness, nausea and/or vomiting.158-160  Most of these symptoms resolved by 24 hours. In more recent experiments using the moderate levels of ethanol that we will target (0.08% blood alcohol concentration), only mild headache, with no nausea or vomiting, has been reported.86-88  There have been no reports of serious adverse events with IV ethanol titrated by the BrAC quick clamp method. In addition, previous studies in which oral whiskey was administered to patients undergoing invasive electrophysiology (EP) studies (discussed above) did not result in any serious adverse events.  While the total volume infused in either the ethanol group or the placebo (D5 half normal saline) group is not expected to exceed 500 cc, there is the theoretical possibility of causing volume overload; of note, patients with a history of heart failure or LVEF < 50% will be excluded.  It is possible that ethanol may potentiate the side effects of other sedatives in patients undergoing AF ablation procedures, but this is unlikely.  All of these cases are staffed by board certified anesthesiologists (with continuous 12 lead electrocardiograms, pulse oximetry, CO2 monitoring, and blood pressure monitoring per an arterial line per standard of care) as well as a cardiac EP attending, a cardiac EP fellow (board certified or board eligible in cardiology) and two nurses. All patients have several large sheaths in place for venous access, defibrillation pads already in place, and the intracardiac catheters can provide pacing if necessary.  An echocardiography machine is immediately available in the EP laboratory and at least one on call interventional cardiologist and interventional cardiology fellow are available in the cardiac catheterization laboratory in the same suite   We observed no complications and no difficulties with recovery or wound healing in the 3 AF ablation patients receiving IV ethanol titrated to a blood ethanol concentration of 0.08% using the BrAC quick clamp method.  We are not aware of any evidence to suggest that ethanol should adversely affect the efficacy of the AF ablation or the recovery or wound healing processes.   Additional risks include prolongation of the AF ablation procedure. We anticipate that the additional procedure time will average 40 minutes.  The left atrial anatomic map will be created using the three dimensional mapping system per the standard clinical procedure while the ethanol or placebo infusion is started and titrated to steady state, helping to minimize any extra procedure time.  This additional procedural time may minimally increase the patient’s risk for stroke or sedation complications including pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism.  Although the EP tests that will be performed and attempts to induce AF are consistent with standard of care during AF ablation procedures per the most recent expert consensus10 (as well as standard of clinical practice in the UCSF cardiac EP laboratory), the potential induction of AF includes a risk of cardioversion, which may minimally increase the risk of skin burns and stroke.  As per standard of care, all patients may undergo transesophageal echocardiograms immediately prior to the procedure to exclude the presence of a left atrial appendage thrombus and all will receive IV heparin with serial ACT monitoring to minimize the risk of stroke.   6.2  Potential Benefits  There are no direct benefits for participating in this study.  However, the knowledge gained from this study may help to elucidate the mechanism underlying AF, which would be pertinent to the ~4 million Americans with the disease.35, 54  In addition, understanding these particular cardiac 
HOLIDAY Protocol  
 v1.1, March 30, 2017                  Page 19 of 32  effects may ultimately benefit the greater than hundred million individuals that consume alcohol.  This may be particularly important as the media often touts alcohol as being “heart healthy.”23-31  7.0 Safety Monitoring   7.1  Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  HOLIDAY has an independent DSMB that is responsible for safeguarding the interests of study participants, assessing the safety and validity of study procedures, and for monitoring the overall conduct of the study and outcomes data.  The DSMB members are independent consultants to the PI at UCSF, and are required to provide recommendations about starting, continuing, and stopping the study.  In addition, the DSMB is asked to make recommendations, as appropriate, to the PI about: • The effects of the HOLIDAY study intervention • Benefit/risk ratio of procedures and participant burden • Selection, recruitment, and retention of participants • Adherence to protocol requirements • Completeness, quality, and analysis of measurements • Amendments to the study protocol • Adequacy of and amendments to consent forms • Performance of the UCSF centers • Participant safety • Notification of and referral for abnormal findings 7.2  Safety monitoring for targeted adverse events  7.2.1  Intra procedure monitoring  During the procedure the patient will be monitored by a comprehensive care team. This will include the electrophysiology attending, the electrophysiology fellow (who is a board certified or board eligible cardiologist), the cardiac anesthesiologist attending (who will be unblinded), and 2 electrophysiology lab nurses. They will continually watch the patient for signs of distress, changes on the continual 12 lead electrocardiogram, hemodynamic changes on the arterial line blood pressure, continuous pulse oximetry and heart rate telemetry. If at any time there is a concern that the infusion is causing dangerous effects, it will be stopped immediately. Possible adverse events (AEs) include: 1. Hypotension: If hypotension occurs during the ethanol administration, intravenous fluids and presser medications will be administered as appropriate by the cardiac anesthesiologist. The anesthesiologist will have the prerogative to stop the infusion if he/she feels that the infusion is contributing to the hypotension and if it is not controlled with fluids or pressers. 2. Hypertension: If hypertension beyond a systolic blood pressure of 180 mmHg occurs during the ethanol administration, the cardiac anesthesiologist may administer intravenous blood pressure medications such as metoprolol, hydralazine, or nitroglycerin. The anesthesiologist will have the prerogative to stop the infusion if he/she feels that the infusion is contributing to the hypertension and if it is not controlled with blood pressure medications. 3. Atrial Fibrillation: This is to be expected and will be dealt with as appropriate. This may include electrical cardioversion or observation depending on what phase of the procedure the patient is in. It is important to emphasize that some of these procedures 
HOLIDAY Protocol  
 v1.1, March 30, 2017                  Page 20 of 32  are routinely performed while a patient is in atrial fibrillation for several hours or throughout the entire case. 4. Pulmonary compromise: The patients will be monitored by the anesthesia team throughout the procedure and the level of ethanol that we will target is not associated with respiratory depression. There is no evidence that ethanol (particularly at modest doses) affects oxygenation. The ethanol infusion can be stopped and the patient can be intubated if there are signs of pulmonary compromise. 5. Agitation: The patient will be monitored by the anesthesia team and agitation induced by ethanol will be dealt with appropriately with sedatives. The PI will also monitor for AEs in all study participants. The research team will discuss the progress of the study and all AEs at weekly research and MMM conferences. At those meetings, feedback will be obtained from attendees. These meetings will also include the Chief of Cardiology, Chief of the EP service, head of quality assurance for electrophysiology, nurses, other EP faculty, fellows, and staff.   7.2.2  Post-Procedure Monitoring  We will monitor patients for up to 12 months via chart review and patient phone calls. Targeted adverse events will be recorded if reported/found at each study follow-up visit.  If three unexpected adverse events occur, then we will put the study on hold and discuss the circumstances associated with the adverse events with the EP group (including the Chief of Cardiology and Chief of Electrophysiology), the anesthesiologists that were present during those cases, and the DSMB. At that time, alternatives to the study design and the possibility of discontinuing the study will be discussed.  8.0  PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  The Principal Investigator is required to adhere to the study protocol, the signed Principal Investigator’s Agreement, applicable federal (national) or state/local, laws and regulations, and any conditions required by the IRB or applicable regulatory authorities.  A protocol deviation is used to describe situations in which the clinical protocol was not followed.  All deviations from the study protocol must be reported on the Protocol Deviation CRF to the UCSF CC, as soon as possible, but no later than 10 working days of notification of the event.  In addition, all deviations must be reported to the local IRB per the IRB’s reporting requirements.  Protocol deviations will also be reported to the DSMB.    9.0 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND DATA MANAGEMENT  9.1 Clinical Site Investigator and Coordinator Training  Each investigator and coordinator will be trained on the study protocol and procedures to ensure accurate and consistent study methods are used study-wide and throughout the entire study duration. Trainings will include review of the protocol, operations manual, CRFs, event reporting, and data management procedures. If any protocol amendments occur during the study, research team trainings will be scheduled as needed.   9.2 Data Handling and Confidentiality  
HOLIDAY Protocol  
 v1.1, March 30, 2017                  Page 21 of 32  Information about study participants will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Those regulations require a signed patient authorization informing the patient of the following:  ● What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from patients in this study ● Who will have access to that information and why ● Who will use or disclose that information ● The rights of a research patient to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  In the event that a participant revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the Principal Investigator, by regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of participant authorization. For participants that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e., that the participant is alive) at the end of their scheduled study follow-up.  9.3  Source Documents   Study files will be kept in a secure location. Participant files should include archives of completed CRFs and source documents. The study case report forms (CRFs) are the primary data collection instrument for the study and are considered source documents. Source data also include original records of clinical findings, observations, or study measurement results (e.g., hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, and patient files).   9.4  Data Collection and Management  A member of the research team will enter data from each CRF into the study REDCap database.  The study data is subjected to checks for completeness, consistency and validity. Upon completion of data collection and all data cleaning efforts have been performed, the database will be locked and analyses will commence.   10.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  Demographic and baseline characteristics will be described using mean with standard deviation, median and interquartile range, or proportions, where appropriate.  The change in AERP and conduction times will be compared within cohorts using paired t-tests (if the outcome is not normally distributed, the Wilcoxon sign rank test will be used), and the changes in those values will be compared by treatment assignment (ethanol versus placebo) using t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests as appropriate. The proportion with inducible AF will be compared by treatment assignment using the chi-squared test, and a logistic regression model will be utilized to adjust for potential confounders that are not addressed by randomization. Full details will be outlined in the Statistical Analysis Plan.    The Primary Analyses will be conducted in the “Analysis Population”, which includes all participants who are (1) randomized and (2) have received the study infusion.  Secondary analyses will be conducted in the full “Randomized Population”, which includes all participants who have been randomized, whether or not they received the study infusion    11.0 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 812 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
HOLIDAY Protocol  
 v1.1, March 30, 2017                  Page 22 of 32   11.1  Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval  This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted IRB.   11.2  Informed Consent  Study personnel must explain to each participant (NOTE: consent by proxy is not allowed for this study) the nature of the study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, the potential risks and benefits involved and any discomfort it may entail.  Each participant must be informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician.  Patients will have to demonstrate adequate reasoning faculties and will have to demonstrate understanding of the implications, risks, benefits and alternatives to participating in the study before consent is obtained.  This will include asking potential participants questions to assure they understand the ramifications of participation.  This informed consent will be given by means of a standard written statement, written in non-technical language. The subject should read and consider the statement before signing and dating it, and should be given a copy of the signed document.  If the participant cannot read or sign the document, oral presentation may be made or signature given by the participant’s legally appointed representative, if witnessed by a person not involved in the study, mentioning that the participant could not read or sign the documents.  No participant will receive a study infusion before his/her informed consent has been obtained.  11.3  Declaration of Helsinki  The investigator must conduct the trial in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

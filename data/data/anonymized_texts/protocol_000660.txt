1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Introduction 
Down syndrome (DS) is a common disorder, occurring in 1 per 800 births,1-3 which 
translates to approximately 5,400 children with DS born in the USA annually. 4 Hallmarks 
of the syndrome include intellectual disability, hypotonia and craniofacial anomalies, and 
congenital cardiac defects occur in 50% of individuals.5 Common comorbidities include 
hypothyroidism, obesity, and the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Untreated OSAS is associated with significant morbidity such as growth failure,
6 systemic,7-9 and 
pulmonary hypertension,10,11 endothelial dysfunction,12,13 and cognitive and behavioral 
deficits.14-19 Median life expectancy in individuals with DS has increased from 25 years in 
1983 to 58 years20,21 in the present day. While this represents a significant advance in health, 
individuals with DS still have early mortality compared to the general population.  It is therefore incumbent upon health care practitioners to diagnose and treat comorbidities, such as OSAS, in order to optimize health and cognitive/behavioral function, increase survival, and maximize health -related quality of life. Individuals with DS are predisposed to OSAS 
due to craniofacial features (midface hypoplasia, glossoptosis), hypotonia, comorbid obesity, and hypothyroidism.
22 Studies have shown a prevalence of OSAS in children with DS 
between 45 and 55%.23-25 Thes e rates are markedly higher than that of typically developing 
children24,25 in whom the prevalence of OSAS is about 2%.26  
Adenotonsillectomy (AT) is considered first-line treatment for childhood OSAS.27 However, 
available data indicate that polysomnography (PSG) improves in only a portion of children with DS after AT.
28 In fact, many children with DS are referred for positive airway pressure 
(PAP) therapy initiation due to persistent OSAS after AT, and PAP appears to be an important feature of the experience of living with DS.
29 PAP has been shown to be highly 
effective at resolving polysomnographic manifestations of OSAS in children and adolescents, including those with DS and other disabilities.
30,31  However, PAP as a 
treatment for OSAS has not been well -studied in children with DS. Furthermore, 
patient/family reported outcomes are an important knowledge gap long overdue in this population. 
1.2 Relevant Lit erature and Data 
DS Prevalence and morbidity :
  Down syndrome (DS) is a common disorder, occurring in1 
per 800 births,1-3 which translates to approximately 5,400 children with DS born in the USA 
annually.4 Hallmarks of the syndrome include intellectual disability, hypotonia and 
craniofacial anomalies. Congenital cardiac defects occur in  50% of individuals.5 Common 
comorbidities include hypothyroidism, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome 
(OSAS).  DS is also associated with premature death and earl y-onset Alzheimer’s disease.32  
Median life expectancy has increased from 25 years in 1983 to 58 years 20,21 in the present 
day. While this represents a significant advance in health, individuals wit h DS still have 
early mortality compared to the general population.  
DS and OSAS: I ndividuals with DS are predisposed to OSAS due to craniofacial features 
(midface hypoplasia, glossoptosis, hypotonia), comorbid obesity, and hypothyroidism.22 
Studies have shown a prevalence of OSAS in children with DS between 45 and 55%.23-25 
   3 
These rates are markedly higher than that of typically developing children 24,25 in whom the 
prevalence of OSAS is about 2%.26 Untreated OSAS is associated with significant morbidity 
such as growth failure,6 systemic7-9 and pulmonary hypertension,10,11 endothelial 
dysfunction,12,13 and cognitive and behavioral deficits.14-19 It is therefore incumbent upon 
health care practitioners to diagnose and treat comorbidities, such as OSAS, in order to 
optimize health and cognitive function, increase survival, and maximize health- related 
quality of lif e in youth with DS and OSAS.  
Treatment of OSAS in Children with DS: Given the high prevalence of OSAS, the 
American Academy of Pediatrics published a clinical report focused on the care of children with DS in 2011.
5 In this guideline, they advised families to assess for OSAS as soon as 6 
months of age and emphasized the poor correlation between parental history and sleep study results. Therefore, they recommended that all children with DS undergo a sleep study by 4 years of age, and that pediatricians discuss the impact of obesity as a risk factor for OSAS. Adenotonsillectomy (AT) is considered first-line treatment for childhood OSAS.
27 However, 
available data indicate that polysomnography (PSG) improves in only a portion of children with DS af ter AT.
28 In fact, many children with DS are referred for positive airway pressure 
(PAP) therapy initiation due to persistent OSAS after AT.29 PAP has been shown to be 
highly effective at resolving polysomnographic manifestations of OSAS in children and adolescents, including those with DS and other disabilities.
30,31  Importantly, studies indicate 
that PAP also reduces symptoms of OSAS and improves school performance, behavior, mood, daytime sleepiness and quality of life (QOL) in typically developing children and adolescents.
30,33  Another important consideration is that PSG results may not predict 
patient -reported outcomes and other physiological responses, indicating a need for studies 
that inform the medical community not only about healthcare provider-relevant outcomes but also about family-relevant outcomes related to the experience of living with DS and OSAS. In addition, RCTs that examine a range of relevant qualitative, clinical and physiological outcomes are lacking. These studies, such as the current proposal, could inform families and the medical community about variation in responses and provide the framework for developing a “precision medicine” approach for future single- or multiple -
staged approaches, matching the best intervention to the individual child defined by appropriate family -relevant, clinical, physiological and/or genetic factors.  
PAP adherence in children with DS : T
 here is a dearth of literature regarding PAP 
adherence in children, and even less in children with DS.34-36  Generally, PAP is inherently 
difficult for individuals to use regularly.  In addition to the daily burden of putting the equipment on each night and discomfort of wearing a mask with pressurized air being administered while sleeping, common side-effects include nasal symptoms (e.g., nasal dryness, rhinorrhea, congestion and epistaxis), eye irritation, skin pressure sores or dermatitis, and aerophagia. Some patients suffer from feeling closed-in by the mask (e.g., claustrophia).  Not surprisingly, PAP efficacy is limited by poor adherence.
37 Most studies 
in the pediatric age range have encompassed a wide age spectrum and heterogeneous populations,
29,37- 39 and have reported improved adherence over time.29,39 Importantly, the 
few studies, all retrospective, including children with DS under the larger umbrella of children with developmental disabilities (DD), have shown better adherence in children with DD compared to typically developing children.
29,39 Hawkins et al reported that DD was a 
positive predictor factor for PAP adherence (OR = 2 .55, 95%CI = 1.27–5.13; p = 0.007),29 
and our group has showed that at 3 months after PAP initiation, adherence was 86.7% [33.9-
   4 
97.9%] of nights in children with developmental disabilities and 62.9% [30.8-87.8%] in 
typically developing children (p=0.01).39  
 
1.3 Compliance Statement  
This study will be conducted in full accordance all applicable Children’s Hospital of 
Philadelphi a Research Policies and Procedures and all applicable Federal and state laws and 
regulations including 45 CFR 46.  All  episodes of noncompliance will be documented. 
The investigators at CHOP and CCHMC will perform the study in accordance with this protocol. CHOP investigators will obtain verbal consent, CCHMC will obtain written consent, and will report unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others in accordance with Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia IRB Policies and Procedures and all federal requirements. Collection, recording, and reporting of data will be accurate and will ensure the privacy, health, and welfare of research subjects during and after the study. 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The purpose of this multi- center  study is to further characterize the experience of living with 
DS and OSAS.  
2.1 Primary Objective (or Aim)

   6 
• Informed Consent  
• Medical record review  
• One semi -structured 30 minute open -ended interview per participant will be 
conducted over the phone. The interview will be audio -recorded  
 
4.1.1 Visit 1  
• Open -ended semi -structured interviews will be conducted over the phone and audio 
recorded . 
4.2 Unscheduled Vi sits 
Due to the nature of this study, unscheduled visits are not expected 
4.3 Subject Completion/Withdrawal  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to their care.  They 
may also be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator if they fail to 
keep the phone interview appointment repeatedly. The Investigator or the Sponsor (if applicable) may also withdraw subjects who violate the study plan, or to protect the subject for reasons of safety or for administrative reasons.  It will be documented whether or not each subject completes the clinical study. If the Investigator becomes aware of any serious, related adverse events after the subject completes or withdraws from the study, they will be recorded in the source documents and on the CRF. 
4.3.1 Early Termination Study Visit 
Subjects who withdraw from the study will not have the interview as this is the only study 
procedure. 
 
5 STUDY EVALUATIONS AND MEASUREMENTS  
5.1 Screening and Monitoring Evaluations and Measurements  
5.1.1 Medical Record Review  
• Date of birth  of child 
• Race, ethnicity, maternal education  of child and parent 
• Zip code of the family  
• Sleep study results of child 
• PAP information  of child: date of initiation of treatment, titration study, adherence  
   7 
• Child comorbidities  
 
5.2 Interview  
Semi -structured interviews will explore such key constructs as knowledge/belief about 
OSAS and PAP therapy, routines and resources that promote or limit PAP use, barriers, self-
efficacy, and communication and attitudes about PAP. T he interviews will be performed 
with the parent and that they will be audio- recorded.  
 
5.3 Safety Evaluation  
Data safety will be strictly monitored during the study. Because of the nature of the study, 
no other safety issues are anticipated.  
 
6 STATISTICAL CONSI DERATIONS  
6.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint will be completing the interviews.  
6.2 Control of Bias and Confounding  
For this mixed methods research, all caregivers meeting criteria will be contacted. The first 
forty  confirming participation  and providing co nsent will be included in the study.  
6.3 Statistical Methods  
6.3.1 Baseline Data  
Baseline and demographic characteristics will be summarized by standard descriptive summaries (e.g. means and standard deviations for continuous variables such as age and percentages for categorical variables such as gender).  
6.3.2 Analysis of Interviews  
Data Analysis: Interviews will be transcribed by Datagain, a professional transcription 
company. Audio files are loaded onto a secure site. In the process of transcription, all identifying information will be removed. Password protected transcripts are returned to the Mixed Methods Research Lab where they are loaded into a password protected NVivo file on a secure server in the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health. Datagain has a business use agreement with the University of Pennsylvania. Once transcripts are verified for accuracy, the audio file will be destroyed. The study team will create a codebook by conducting a line by line reading of the first five transcripts. The investigators will identify key ideas in the transcripts and will use these key ideas to form codes. Each code will be operationalized and decision rules for their application will be included in the definition. Once the codebook is stabilized, the team will double code the first five transcripts and will use the interrater reliability function in NVivo to ascertain agreement. 
   8 
Once 95% agreement has been achieved,  the team  will code the remaining transcripts, 
checking interrater reliability every fifth transcript.  
Coded data will be summarized, examined for patterns and used to identify factors 
associated with adherence and non -adherence as well as implementation.  
6.4 Sample Size and Power  
In qualitative research, sample size is dictated by the principle of saturation. Saturation is when no new themes arise among each of the key subgroups in the sample. Several factors dictate an estimation of when saturation might be achieved. Key among these is the degree of homogeneity within the sample. Since the families we will recruit are all dealing with a similar set of issues and similar clinical contexts, we anticipate that saturation will be likely with up to 15 families per site.
40 We will conduct our analysis concurrent with data 
collection, using the constant comparative method. In this approach, we iteratively move between codes and texts, constantly looking for examples of existing ideas and being alert to new ones. This process enables us to learn when no new ideas emerge within the group as a whole and within each site. Although in our experience we typicall y achieve saturation with 
approximately 15 interviews per group, we have allowed for up to 20 interviews per site so that we can assure that saturation has been achieved.  
7 SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
7.1 Clinical Adverse Events 
Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study.  
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting 
Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If any 
unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others happen during the course of this study (including SAEs) these will be reported to the IRB in accordance with CHOP IRB SOP 408: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be summarized in narrative or other format.  
8 STUDY ADMINISTRATION  
8.1 Data Collection and Management  
 
1. Confidentiality.  Password protected transcripts will be saved  into a password 
protected NVivo file on a secure server at CHOP . Access to data will be limited to 
study team me mbers. Demographic and PAP data will be entered and saved in a 
CHOP -based REDCap  system . All identifiers will be saved in the system.  
2. Security.  Same as above.  
 
   9 
3. Anonymization, de-identification or destruction.  All PHI identifiers and HIPAA 
related documents (consents, HIPAA authorization forms) will be deleted 6 years 
after study completion, in accordance with Policy A-3-9.   
4. All data from the semi-structured interviews will be audio recorded. Recordings will be promptly removed from portable recording devices and saved to a secure, password- protected CHOP -based computer, identified by study ID.  
 
 
8.2 Confidentiality  
No identifiable data will be used for a future study without first obtaining IRB approval or 
determination of exemption . The investigator will obtain a data use agreement between 
provider (the PI) and any recipient researchers (including others at CHOP) before sharing a 
limited dataset (dates and zip codes).  
8.3 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
8.3.1 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
• Principal Investigator : It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee 
the overall safety of the study. This will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events. Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. The PIs responsibility will be to assure that appropriate study data are communicated to the participant’s family and physicians and that appropriate referrals or interventions are initiated.  
• Institutional Review Board: CH OP will be the central IRB of this study. It  is the 
responsibility  of the Principal  Investigator at each clinical  site to provide their IRB  
with all pertinent material,  including a copy of the informed  consent.  Approval from 
the reviewing IRB  of the inform ed consent form  must be obtained prior to screening  
or enrolling any participants.  The clinical  site’s  Principal  Investigator  also maintains  
the responsibility of coordinating with the central IRB  in initiating  protocol re-
approval, notification  of protocol and/or consent form changes, adverse even ts, and 
termination  of the study according to the appropriate IRB requirements. Risk 
Assessment  
Interviews and record reviews.  As with any study that involves collecting data, it is 
possible that someone who is not involved with the study may get access to participants’ confidential information. Every precaution will be taken to secure participants' personal information to ensure confidentiality. At the time of participation, each par ticipant will be 
assigned a study identification number. This number will be used on data collection forms and in the study database instead of names and other private information. A separate list that links each participant's name to the study identification number will be maintained for future reference and communication. 
   10 
8.3.2 Potential Benefits of Study Participation  
Direct benefits: There are no direct benefit to the subjects.  
Indirect benefits:  Findings derived of this study will help increasing the understanding of the 
experience of living with DS and OSAS, and provide useful information for a future 
intervention trial of adherence to PAP in this population. 
8.3.3 Risk -Benefit Assessment  
The risks of this study are not greater than minimal risk .  
8.4 Recruitment Strategy  
CHOP p articipants will be recruited from the Sleep Center and the Down syndrome clinic, 
which are within the division of the investigators of the current proposal. Caregivers 
meeting eligibility criteria will receive a letter and a follow-up phone call from the 
investigators inviting them to participate in a one -time phone interview.  
Cincinnati study participants will be identified for preliminary eligibility by study physicians and through the CCHMC DS clinic. 
8.5 Informed Consent  and HIP AA Authorization 
A member of the study team at CHOP  will be responsible for obtaining verbal informed 
consent from each participant. I nformed consent  will be obtained before this research study. 
Prospective participants  will be given unlimited time to decide their participation. They  will 
be asked to explain back to the investigators the nature of the study, study procedures and 
the risks and benefits of participation to assure their understanding. 
A member of the s tudy team at Cincinnati will obtain writte n consent for study procedures. 
All aspects of the study will be explained in detail to each family by a team member.   All 
questions will be answered and participants and families will be given time to consider their 
decision.  They will be informed of the nature of this research, its potential benefits and possible risks.  They will be informed that they are free to refuse participation or to withdraw from the study and that this will not affect any future medical care.  
 
8.6 Payment to Subjects/Families  
8.6.1 Payme nts to participants for time and inconvenience (i.e. compensation)  
• Participants at CHOP will receive a $50 .00 gift card for their participation.  
• Participants at Cincinnati will receive a $50.00 reloadable debit card (ClinCard).  
9 PUBLICATION  
It is anticipated that the completed study will be submitted for publication to a peer-
reviewed medical j ournal.

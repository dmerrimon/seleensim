Subjects	will	be	randomized	2:1:1	to	transcutaneous	afferent	patterned	stimulation	(TAPS),	sham	(zero-amplitude	stimulation),	or	‘no	intervention’,	respectively.		Subjects	randomized	to	the	TAPS	and	sham	arms	will	be	blinded	to	their	randomization	assignments	for	the	first	2-3	weeks	of	participation	(controlled	phase).	After	the	first	2-3	weeks,	all	subjects	will	be	crossed	over	to	TAPS	(open-label	phase)	for	2-3	weeks.	During	study	participation,	all	subjects	are	to	remain	on	a	stable	dosage	of	medications	prescribed	for	the	treatment	of	essential	tremor,	if	applicable.			Effectiveness	Assessments	The	effectiveness	of	the	Cala	ONE	device	in	reducing	essential	tremor	symptoms	will	be	evaluated	by	analyzing	the	following:		In-office	physician-rated	assessments:	- Clinical	Rating	Scale	for	Tremor	(CRST)		- Clinical	Global	Impression	of	Severity	(CGI-S)	- Clinical	Global	Impression	of	Improvement	(CGI-I)	Subject-rated	assessments	(in-office	and	at-home):	- Bain	&	Findley	Activities	of	Daily	Living	(ADL)	Scale	- Quality	of	life	in	Essential	Tremor	Questionnaire	(QUEST)	- Patient	Global	Impression	of	Severity	(PGI-S)	- Patient	Global	Impression	of	Improvement	(PGI-I)	- Subject	survey	of	satisfaction	and	durability	of	effect	(i.e.	on	average	how	long	tremor	relief	lasts	after	a	stimulation	session)

Blinding	The	first	2-3	weeks	of	the	study	are	double-blinded	for	the	treatment	and	sham	arms.	The	subjects	and	rating	movement	disorder	neurologists	will	be	blinded	to	the	therapy	allocation	for	the	treatment	and	sham	arms.	The	subjects	in	the	‘no	intervention’	arm	and	their	rating	neurologists	will	not	be	blinded	to	their	therapy	allocation.			The	last	2-3	weeks	are	open-label,	and	all	subjects	will	be	given	the	option	to	use	the	Cala	ONE	device.

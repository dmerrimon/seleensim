Title of study : Real-World Medication Adherence Trajectories of Nintedanib among 
Idiopathic Pulmonary  Fibrosis Patients
Rationale and 
background:Medication adherence is of great importance to health care 
stakeholders .  The most common method to measure adherence in 
real-world settings is via the proportion of day s covered (PDC) in 
prescription drug claims databases.  However, PDC is limited by  its 
inability  to distinguish between different patterns of adherence over 
time.  This study  will usegroup -based trajectory  modeling (GBTM) 
to assess adherence trajectories to ninteda niband patient 
characteristics associated wit hthose trajectories.  The results of this 
study  can help providers/pay ers to better identify  adults with I PF who 
are at high risk of nintedanib non -adherence. The identified non-
adherence trajectories may  highlight the need for a target ed
intervention str ategy  to improve adherence in patients with each 
trajectory .
Research 
question and 
objectives:Identification of adherence trajectories ofnintedanib use among IPF 
patients.
Understanding characteristics of patients within each nintedanib
adherence trajectory  among IPF patients. 
Study design: This is a non- interventional , retrospective cohort study .

Population: The study  sample will consist of community -dwelling Medicare 
beneficiaries with IPF who initiate treatment with nintedanib.
Variables: The main study  outcome is nintedanib adherence trajector ies.  
A range of predictor variables will be measured in the administrative 
data during the baseline and index date, including patient 
demographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, race/eth nicity ),Social 
Deprivation Index, residential location, clinical characteristics (e.g., 
comorbidity  index , IPF-
related costs and use ), and all-cause health 
care costs and use.
Data sources: This study  will use administrative enrollment and claims data from 
the U.S. federal Medicare program for beneficiaries aged 65 years and 
older who were continuously  enrolled in Original Medicare insurance 
coverage, including Parts A, B and D.  The stud y will use Medicare 
data covering the period from October 1, 2013 through December 31, 
2019. 
Study size: The minimum needed sample size for GBTM analysis is 500. A prior study 
found 1,464 Medicare beneficiaries who initiated nintedanib between 
10/15/2014 and 12/31/2015 ( Corral, Chang et al., 2020 ).  By covering a 
longer period with the same data, this study should have sufficient sample.
Data analysis: In the first part, m onthly trends in nintedanib PDC will be analysed via 
GBTM estimation, which assumes there is a fixed number of latent clusters 
of individuals who share a common outcome pattern.  The methodology will 
yield estimated probabilities of cluster membership for each individual and 
an esti mated trajectory curve over time for each cluster.   In the second part, 
multinomial logi sticmodels will be estimated to identify individual -level 
predictors of cluster membership.
Milestones: The analytic database is expected to be constructed by August 30, 2021, 
pending access to the Medicare data.   Data analyses are expected to be 
completed by October 15, 2021.  A draft report of the findings from this 
study is expected to be available for review by November 15, 2021 and

7. RATIONALE AND BACKGR OUND
Medication adherence is of great importance to health care stakeholders based on increasing 
evidence of prevalence of non-adherence to chronic medications in the United States ( Desai 
et al., 2019 ) and increasing evidence that adherence is associated with better health outcomes 
and lower costs ( Cutler et al., 2018 ).  There are several way s by whic h adherence to 
medications can be measured. Each of these methods has its own strengths and limitations 
(Forbes et al., 2018 ).  Direct methods, which include blood drug assay s, and direct 
observation of the patients are expensive, laborious, and time intensive ( Farmer, 1999).  In 
real-world settings, use of prescription claims databases, patient self- report, pill counts, and 
electronic monitoring are the common measures of adherence ( Lam and Fresco, 2015 ).  The 
most common method to measure adherence in real -world settings is via the proportion of 
days covered (PDC) in prescription drug claims databases (Harbaugh and Cooper, 2018 ).  
PDC has been defined as the number of day s supplied of a specific medication in the follow -
up period divided by  the total number of day s during follow -up, multiplied by  100 to y ield a 
percentage from 0% –100% ( Raebel et al., 2013 ).
Although PDC is usefu l in that it offers in a single number a metric of medication adherence 
over a predefined period of time, it is also limited because it does not distinguish between 
different patterns of adherence over that same period ( Alhazami et al., 2020 ).  For example, a 
patient who took medications every  other day  for a y ear would have a PDC of 50%; likewise, 
a patient who took the medication for the first 6 months uninterrupted and then not again for 
the remainder of the year would also ha ve a PDC of 50%.  Distinguishing these different 
patterns is critical to understanding adherence to prescription medication and designing 
interventions to improve adherence.
One alternative is to detect trajectories of adherence over time across patients using group -
based trajectory  modeling (GBTM) ( Nagin and Odgers, 2010).  GBTM has been applied with 
increasing frequency  for this purpose in several conditions (Alhazami et al., 2020; Bateman 
et al., 2016 ;Dillon et al., 2018 ; Feldman et al., 2018 ; Franklin et al., 2018 ; Franklin et al., 
2015 ; Franklin et al.; 2013 ; Hargrove et al., 2017 ; Juarez et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2017; Li et 
al., 2014 ; Lo-Ciganic et al., 2016 ; MacEwen et al., 2016 ; Paranjpe et al., 2020 ; Vadhari ya et 
al., 2019 ; Wang et al., 2019 ; Zongo et al., 2019 ).  In most of these studies, monthly  PDC was 
assessed for each patient , and a GBTM was fit on the patient -level sequences of monthly  
PDC values to identify a best -fitting set of adherence trajectories as well as, for each patient, 
estimates of the probability of belonging to each trajectory  group.
Studies that examine adherence trajectories with GBTMs frequentl y include anal yses of the 
predictors of patients’ membership in trajectory  groups.  Individual characteristics that have 
been observed to be related to adherence trajectories include age , race , sex, disease severity , 
comorbidity  burden, educational attainment, and socioeconomic status (Alhazami et al., 
2020).
Adherence to nintedanib has been evaluated in a few recent studies in the United States.  
Recent observational studies of nintedanib and pirfenidone suggest that despite different side-

effect profiles, adherence to and persistence with therap y are similar. Adherence (measured 
as PDC ≥ 80% ) of ninteda nibduring one year has been estimated at 60.5% ( Corral, Chang, et 
al., 2020 ), 51% ( Corral, DeYoung, and Kong, 2020 ), and 71.3% ( Ipatova et al., 2019 ).  No 
studies to our knowledge have analy zed nintedanib adherence using GBTM or comparable 
methods nor have an y studies assessed predictors of adherence .
Therefore, the objective of this study  is to assess nintedanib adherence trajectories using 
GBTMs and understand characteristics of patients within each trajectory . The results of this 
study  can help providers and payers to better identify  adults with IPF who are at high risk of 
nintedanib non -adherence. The identified non -adherence trajectories may  highlight the need 
for a fit -for-targeted intervention strategy  to improve adherence in patients within each 
trajectory .

9. RESEARCH METHODS
9.1 STUDY DESIGN
This is a non- interventional cohort study  using existing administrative data from the U.S. 
Medicare program. There will be no comparison groups nor an y exposure variables.  As 
shown in Figure 1
, the study  sample will consist of community -dwelling Medicare 
beneficiaries with IPF who initiated treatment with nintedanib between 10/01/2014 to 
12/31/2018.  To allow for a one -year baseline period and one -year follow -up period for all 
benefi ciaries who initiated nintedanib between 10/01/2014 and 12/31/2018, the span of data
will be from 10/01/2013 t o 12/31/2019.

9.2 SETTING
9.2.1 Study sites
The study  will use 100% Medicare claims and enrollment data from the U.S. Medicare 
program on community -dwelling beneficiaries continuously  enrolled in traditional, or fee -for-
service, Medicare insurance coverage for inpatient hospital, skilled nursing and outpatient 
facility  services (Part A), phy sician and other professional services (Part B), and outpatient 
prescription drugs (Part D). 
The enrollment file contains monthly  information on individuals’ enrollment in each part of 
Medicare, demographic information, residential location (at the 5 -digit ZIP Code level), and 
date of death.  
Claims data are available for all medical services covered b y the program and are organized 
into data files based on the nature and source of the claim.  The Inpatient, Outpatient, and 
SNF files include institutional claims fr om hospitals for inpatient and outpatient services and 
from nursing homes for short -stay “skilled” admissions, respectivel y.  The Carrier file 
includes fee -for-service claims submitted by  professional providers, including ph ysicians, 
physician assistants, clinical social workers, nurse practitioners.  (Claims for some 
organizational providers, such as free-standing facilities are also found in the Carrier file.  
Examples include independent clinical laboratories, ambulance providers, free -standing 
ambulator y surgical centers, and free -standing radiology  centers.)  Separate files include 
claims for durable medical equipment, home health visits and hospice care.  
Pharmacy  Part D claims include complete prescription drug information, and all standardized 
prescription-level fields collected on a t ypical pharmacy  claim (e.g., date of fill or refill, drug 
name and class, strength, quantity , and day s’ supply ).

9.3 VARIABLES
9.3.1 Exposures
This is a study  of nintedanib adherence patterns, and all the included patients will be patients 
with a prescription claim for nintedanib .
9.3.2 Outcomes
9.3.2.1 Primary  outcomes
The main outcome of this study  is adherence trajectories to nintedanib. This study  will use
theGBTM method to identify trajectories of adherence .
For this purpose, first claim for nintedanib will be identified in the Part D claims file based on 
the presence of an 11-digit NDC code for nintedanib (00597 -0143- 60, 00597 -0145 -60 
[CanMED, 2021]) .  Nintedanib supply  calendars will be constructed for theall twelve 30-day 
time intervals following the individual’s nintedanib initiation date based on each claim’s 
service date and day s’ supply . 
-Supply  will be assigned as 1 for each day  with positive day s’ suppl y of nintedanib.

-If a patient has multiple prescription claims for nintedanib on the same date, the maximum 
of day s’ suppl ywill be calculated across the claims and applied to the supply  calendar.  
-
Stockpiling will be implemented if a patient has prescription claims for nintedanib that 
overlap .  Day s’ supply  for the newer claim will be postponed to the first day after end of the 
older claim’s suppl y.
-For each 30 -day month following the nintedanib initiation date, PDC will be calculated as 
the sum of day s with supply divided by  30.
In this way , we are able to calculate m onthl y nintedanib proportion of days covered . By using 
the twelve 30- days PDC values as outcomes in the GBTM, the probabilities that a given 
individual is in each of the latent clusters will be calculated b y the GBTM estimation 
procedure. GBTMs will be estimated using the Stata plugin traj (Jones and Nagin, 2013 ).
9.3.3 Covariates
The index date will be defined as the date of the beneficiary ’s first Part D claim for 
nintedanib.   The baseline period will consist of the 360 consecutive days ending the day  
before the index date.  The follow -up period will consist of the 360 consecutive day s starting 
with the index date.  
Variable Description

without a car, and percent non -employ ed adults 
under 65 years of age.”  This version was 
calculated in 2015 using data from 2015 and 
updates the original version created b y Butler et al. 
(2013).  Higher values for the Social Deprivation 
Index indicate more social deprivation.
Clinical characteristics
Combined comorbidity  indexThe combined comorbidity  index will be a 
continuous comorbidity  score ranging from 0 to 26 
as measured from comorbidity  diagnosis codes in 
any position on inpatient, outpatient and Carrier 
claims that occurred during the baseline period.  
The combined como rbidity  score is based on 
research b y Gagne et al. (2011) and Sun et al. 
(2017) to identify  the conditions in the union of the 
two most -popular comorbidity  indexes used in 
administrative claims data, the Charlson index and 
the Elixhauser index.  For a sample of Medicare 
beneficiaries, Gagne et al. (2011) found that a 
subset of 20 conditions predicted mortalit y at 30, 
60, 90 and 180 day s, and 1 y ear more accurately  
than either of the two indexes on their own.  
Moreover, unlike the Charlson and Elixhauser 
indexes, Gagne et al.’s (2011) combined index is 
not conditioned on inpatient hospital admission.

9.4 DATA SOURCES
As described above in Section 9.2.1 , all variables will be constructed from the 100% 
Medicare claims and enrolment data from the U.S. Medicare program for the individuals 
meeting the sample selection criteria.  To allow for a one -year baseline period and one -year 
follow -up period for all beneficiaries who initiated nintedanib between 10/01/2014 and 
12/31/2018, the Medicare will span 10/01/2013 through 12/31/2019.
9.5 STUDY SIZE
This study  will use the GBTM technique to adherence pattern. Based on empirical results 
generated b y resampling of po pulation data, the maximum likelihood estimates obtained in 
group -based trajectory  models provide reasonabl y close estimates of their true population 
values and have approximately  normal distributions, even when estimated with a sample size 
as small as n = 500 ( Loughran and Nagin, 2006 ). A prior study  found 1,464 Medicare

beneficiaries who initiated nintedanib between 10/15/2014 and 12/31/2015 ( Corral, Chang et 
al., 2020 ). By  covering a longer period wit h the same data, this study  should have a sufficient 
sample.
9.6 DATA MANAGEMENT
Pursuant to requirements guiding participation in the  
 Innovator program,  staff will access the Medicare claims and 
enrolment data onl y through the .  As such,  will not directly possess an y 
beneficiary -level  data, and the onl y data to be downloaded from the  will be 
summary -level statistics.
 staff will access the  environment via the VMw are Horizon Client (or 
whichever client is mandated by  ) from dedicated computers.  All  
computers are secured with Microsoft BitLocker (for hard drive encry ption at rest), Microsoft 
Azure Active Directory  (to implement local security  policies, including password 
management), BitDefender (anti -virus software), and L oJack (for computer tracking and 
remote wiping if ever needed).
All data manipulation and anal ysis will be conducted on the  environment 
remotely  by  staff.  Dat a manipulation and anal ysis will be conducted using SAS 
software ( ) and Stata software ( ).
9.7 DATA ANALYSIS
9.7.1 Main analysis
The objective of the main anal ysis is to identify  the adherence patterns of nintedanib among 
IPF patients. The unit of anal ysis will be the individual beneficiary , each of whom will have 
twelve 30- days time intervals measur ments of nintedanib PDC spanning the follow -up 
period.  The 12 PDC values (PDC01 –PDC12) will be characterized descriptively  with 
measured of central tendency  (mean, median), spread (min, max, interquartile range), and 
proportions of beneficiaries with PDC in each of 0 to <20%, 20 to <40%, 40 to <60%, 60 to 
<80%, and 80 to 100%.
GBTM will be used to explore the presence of distinct trajectories based on the change in 
medication adherence over time. The output of GBTM will include estimated probabilities of 
cluster membership for each individual and an estimated trajectory  curve over time for each 
cluster. Differe nt models will be used to identify  2 to 5 groups by  using either cubic, 
quadratic, or quartic terms. The final models will be based on Bay esian information criteria, 
and Nagin's criteria for model adequacy (Nagin and Odgers, 2010
),with consideration given 
to group size such that the proportion of patients in each group is not less than 5% of the total 
sample. The output of the final model will give us the estimated average trajectory  for each 
group, as well as the estimated probabi lities of membership in each trajectory  for each 
patient. We will decide the number and shapes of trajectories based on both model fit,

ensuring enough class size and clinical usefulness (Hickson, et al, 2020). An example of 
using GBTM for assessing medication adherence is provided in Figure2 .
Figure 2 GBTM medication adherence example
Two sensitivity  anal yses will be conducted: 
-First, the anal ysis will be repeated for beneficiaries who have positive PDC in the 
fourth month.  I n these models, only  data from months 4 through 12 will be used to 
estimate the GBTMs because PDC01–PDC03 will have been used to condition the 
estimation sample.  
-Second, the GBTMs will be re -estimated using as the ou tcome continuous PDC (for 
the same twelve30 -day time intervals) and the beta distribution ( Elmer, Jones and 
Nagin, 2018).
For each trajectory  group identified, the mean PDC and the percent of beneficiaries in that 
group who discon tinued nintedanib will be calculated.
9.7.2 Additional analysis
The objective of the additional analy sis is to understand characteristics of patients within 
each nintedanib adherence trajectory  among IPF patients. The unit of anal ysis will be the 
individual beneficiary , and the outcomes will be the vector of estimated probabilities of

cluster membership from a given GBTM.   The predictor variables will be the baseline 
covariates ( Section 9.3 .3).
The distributions of the covariates will be characterized with descriptive statistics, including 
frequencies and percentages for discrete or categorical variables, and means, standard 
deviations, medians, and interquartile ranges for continuous varia bles.
Associations between the predictors and the probabilities of trajectory  membership will be 
quantified using fractional multinomial logit models estimated via quasi -maximum likelihood 
(Papke and Wooldridge, 1996 ).  Associati ons will be calculated both as odds ratios 
(exponentating the fractional multinomial logit model’s coefficients) and average marginal 
effects on the probabilit y scale.
9.8 QUALITY CONTROL
The Medicare administrative data collection occurred in the past and the data will be obtained 
from . No additional insight into the data collection procedures is available bey ond that 
which has been published by  . As a result, we are rel ying on qualit y control measures 
implemented by   during data collection.
has established protocols for qualit y control of anal yses. All anal yses are audited 
before the finalization of results.  The auditor will independentl y review the conceptual and 
technical elements of the anal ysis with a critical eye to identify ing an y flaws or potential 
errors.
The auditor will understand the goal of the analy sis and the expected results, and then review 
each step of the  data anal ysis audit checklist (available upon request). The auditor 
will keep a list of questions or issues and then meet with the project lead to discuss any  
findings.  If errors or issues are found that change the results, the auditor will perform an 
incremental audit to ensure that changes have been implemented properl y and an y change in 
results aligns with expe ctations about magnitude and direction.
9.9 LIMITATIONS OF THE RESEARCH MET HODS
This study  has several limitations, which include:
- Absence of data on some behavioral factors (e.g. patient- physician communication, 
fear of disease/side effects, and family  suppor t) which may  affect non -adherence. 
-Reliance on prescription fill data to define adherence may  not capture the actual use 
of the medication.
-In this stud y, patients who had 12 months of continued fee -for-service enrollment of 
Parts A, B, and D before and a fter index dates were included.
